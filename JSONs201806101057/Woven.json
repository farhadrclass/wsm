I could almost smell and feel the history involved, so much research has so obviously gone on here. and it works Bree Moore has brought this legend to vibrant life.and even know roughly knowing the way this was going to play out I still found myself wishing I could tweak the outcomes, I was obviously facing, so invested was I in this fascinating tale.This story flowed well and easily kept my attention throughout and the characters involved felt fresh and not recycled, not an easy job when reselling a story that has been told so often so a very well done to the author herself for this feat, I was impressed.The females I found especially, were such strong individuals, showing up there male counterparts completely.Merlin was the only male I generally liked here, he was the only one I felt had a core of genuine integrity.It was ironic really all the honour and loyalty that was bandied around by the men when it was the woman themselves that were the towers of strength and steadfastness.This really was a joy to read. The way this tale was narrated with multiple personality inputs was great, it gave a very rounded portrayal of all involved here.I just wish there could have been a happier outcome for our fair ladies, I know, I know, it's the way the legend play's out, but this is a fable and as such I think is open to interpretation, so why not tweak the outcome, stack the deck and give all involved a much happier ever after.That is except for maybe Arthur and Lancelot, I really didn't like these two very much, a pair of douchbags in my modern day opinion, the females portrayed here got totally shafted, big style, by these two.This legend so needs a rewrite with a proper ending for the girls, give them a break jeez.So if you like stories rich in history and steeped in legend this is the book for you.But before I go a warning Woven contains sexual assault and rape scenes if this at all is a trigger for you please do avoid.The scenes are in keeping with the story and it's not there for shock value, this is days of old when times were different and woman were seen as chattel but it's there all the same, so thought you should be aware before reading.So that's it for me, Thank you to the author Bree Moore for providing me with a copy of Woven.This is my own free and honest opinion.\nReviewed By Beckie Bookwormhttps://www.facebook.com/beckiebookworm/www.beckiebookworm.com"}, {"userName": "Tasha and Megan Mahoney", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25297207-tasha-and-megan-mahoney", "userReview": "Story: 4Narration: 4Overall: 4Woohoo! A dark twist on a classic tale is something that this reviewer loves to see. I was very intrigued by the description of Woven and I can\u2019t say that I was disappointed. The very beginning of Woven gives background for how one of our leading ladies, Elaina, becomes trapped in the tower that she unfortunately spends thirty years in. The point of view swaps often between Elaina and Guinevere who whilst being different in personality are very strong women. Elaina seems rather demure in certain chapters, but as the book goes on her determination to escape and recover memories, that she seems to have lost, becomes a very admirable trait. Guinevere was written quite feisty which personally I had always imagined her to be, so she was an instant like. She is drawn to King Arthur almost instantly upon meeting him, however whenever Guinevere is around Lancelot she feels strange and faint. What could this mean for her?I would like to add the disclaimer that there is sexual abuse further on in the book, however it is true to the time period and not for shock value.At the start I wasn\u2019t sure that I was fond of the narration, as I felt that there wasn\u2019t much emotion in Rebecca McKernan\u2019s voice. There was clarity and good pacing to her voice but I hadn\u2019t yet felt that the heart of the character was portrayed, however further in the book when the characters were more fleshed out I listened in a whole different light so upon reflection I think that this was more due to me not knowing the characters well at that point.In conclusion I think that this is an extremely creative take on the classic tale, and works well as an audio book, and I was entirely invested in where the story took our main characters who I had come to really appreciate.I received this audiobook as part of my participation in a blog tour with Audiobookworm Promotions. The tour is being sponsored by Bree Moore. The gifting of this audiobook did not affect my opinion of it."}, {"userName": "C.A.

Evidence:1) She wrote retellings of Arthurian legends (as did I)).2) The same narrator who read her book is currently reading Intangible for me: the very talented Rebecca McKernan. What are the odds?!3) I know this is kind of the same as #1, but her book actually contains the full text of Alfred Lord Tennyson\u2019s The Lady of Shalott, and Elaina is arguably the main character. (I mean, I have this painting\u00a0(https://www.1st-art-gallery.com/John-...) hanging over my bed\u2026 largely because of Anne of Green Gables\u2019 reference to the poem, but I do love the poem in its own right, also.)So now that that\u2019s out of the way\u2026I love retellings in general: they\u2019re the perfect blend of something familiar and something unique. I know how the story should go (at least for the most part), but I\u2019m constantly guessing what new twists this particular author is going to add. Woven was definitely full of twists, in many ways turning the tales upside down. No spoilers, but let\u2019s just say that certain characters aren\u2019t (only) who you think they are, nor are relationships between characters exactly what you\u2019ve always heard them to be\u2026 and because we\u2019re already in a world of magic, nearly anything is possible.The story is told in third person limited, jumping around to different points of view\u2014but primarily it bounces between Elaina (the Lady of Shalott), Sir Gareth, and Guinevere. Elaina and Mordred are lovers, well before Camelot\u2019s time, and she becomes pregnant before her sister Morgan has her confined to her tower for her own protection. The Lady of Shalott pines away for unrequited love of Lancelot, or so we\u2019ve been told\u2026 and this is both true, and not true in this story. Guinevere is unfaithful to King Arthur with Lancelot\u2026 which is also both true, and not true. Mordred and Arthur are said to be mortal enemies, and also father and son\u2026 which is true, but not in the same way you\u2019ve always heard. The Lady of the Lake, the Sorceress Nimue, does imprison Merlin\u2026 but not for the reason you think. Moore even works in the story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (only in this case it\u2019s Sir Gareth). The way she weaves these familiar tales together (no pun intended) was delightful.The story still ends the way the stories all end\u2014it is a tragedy, after all, and generally I don\u2019t like sad stories. But it\u2019s kind of like going to see the film \u201cTitanic\u201d: you kind of know what you\u2019re in for by the title, and to me, it\u2019s somehow easier to take when I know it\u2019s coming. The fun was figuring out how we\u2019re going to get there this time around.(One caution though: this story contains quite a few fairly descriptive rape scenes toward the end. I didn\u2019t care for this part, but it didn\u2019t bother me as much as it otherwise might, because it was really the only possible way I can think of to explain the story\u2019s main twist. If this isn\u2019t for you, though, I\u2019d steer clear.)"}, {"userName": "Michelle Rawlings", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6772184-michelle-rawlings", "userReview": "I'm always happy to support an indie author, and Moore does not disappoint!

Bree Moore captures a unique tone in this Arthurian legend retelling. She covers classic themes of betrayal, honour, infidelity, love, dark magic and human courage, but then she goes even deeper... She casts a new angle and perspective on the story of Guinevere that is captivating, sometimes frightening and heartbreaking (be prepared to delve into some adult themes here). She takes us into the tower of the Lady of Shalott to experience the anguish of Elaina as she longs for contact with the outside world.

Bree Moore takes us back into an Arthurian tale, but rewrites the story, blending it with old and new. In this book, a new story is woven that gives us a new view of the original, and a unique twist that others have not given us. Elaina is in love. She goes out one afternoon with Mordred, her beloved, and when a storm sets in they are separated and she gets lost. Lured to a tower, she learns that she is now a captive of it, and that should she attempt to escape the enchantment placed upon her will kill her. Elaina is cursed to only look at a mirror and weave what the loom and magic direct her to do. Years pass, and no one comes to find her. She resigns herself to her fate until...one fateful day arrives and a young man who wishes to become a knight happens upon her in the tower. This happens chance encounter is but a single piece of a larger picture being woven. Guinevere, at her own home, rejoices at the return of her father from war. He does not come alone though. With him comes the King, Arthur Pendragon. As the original story goes, Arthur takes a fancy to Guinevere, but when she encounters Lancelot, she always has a fainting spell. Something is not right and soon the root of the problem will make itself known. There is a dark secret hiding in the shadows, and with each passing day, it will creep closer and closer to the forefront. War, betrayal, truth and more are coming and many will be lost along the way.Woven by Bree Moore is the first book by this author and I have to say that I truly enjoyed this story. When it comes to Arthurian tales I have a love-hate relationship towards them. I've not always been a fan of Guinevere, but this book casts her in a different light than I am used to, so she grows on me this time. Like a steady stream or river, this book flows from one moment to the next. The characters are engaging and well done, and there are more than a few twists and surprises to be found. I found this story to be truly unique and enjoyable. There are complicated situations, strong human emotions and some hints of magic in the story. I love how the author brings the characters to life the way that she does. You can almost feel yourself with them as you are reading. I like how the author sticks to the original story but gives it her own unique twist. The variety of characters that the author shifts between are each interesting. The author gives us a background in the appropriate places and answers most of the questions that are raised throughout the story by the end. I will warn that there are some questions that are left unanswered, but this is not a downside for me since the author intends to give us a sequel that I am eagerly anticipating. There a few minor editorial issues in this book, but there is nothing to the point of where you can't move past it or that it interrupts the overall enjoyment of the story. I will warn that there are a couple scenes/situations in this story that might not be for everyone. The author touches on a sensitive subject, but she does so in a delicate manner. The scenes and situations are not explicit in any way and are handled in a decent manner for readers. I applaud the author for this. I am rating this book 5 out of 5 stars. I enjoyed this author's take on an Arthurian tale. The ending is open-ended but is still well done in my opinion. The characters are engaging, dynamic and interesting. I look forward to reading the next book by this author.

I was actually quite surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. The book is actually a dual story book that in the end meets up. First of all the book is written from Guinevere's perspective. So far I have never read or even heard of a book from her perspective. Elaina has been held captive in the Tower for 30 years. Her life has been to weave a tapestry of life. The tapestry is in control of her, it makes her weave for days and nights on end at times without letting her stop to eat or drink even. When she awoke in the Tower on that first day she was told she could not look out the window or at any man that may come along or she would die. All she has to see life moving on outside of her room is a Enchanted Mirror. One day the face of a man shows u in the mirror that will change her life forever. Guinevere has an accident and gets a bad head injury after she awakes she finds she has multiple personalities. One of the personalities is a young abused girl the other is a grown woman with an agenda. She is making plans Sir Lancelot to kill King Arthur. Guinevere must try to save him.This is where the 2 stories start to meld together.

There is the demure Elaina, who has been cursed to spend her life in a secluded in a tower weaving the tapestry of life, while Guinevere, a spirited and feisty young woman, begins a duplicitous love affair that sets the stage for King Arthur\u2019s eventual downfall. Moore\u2019s telling of the Camelot story is a unique and fascinating blend, injecting ancient folk songs and fairy tales like \u201cRapunzel\u201d into the traditional and well-known plotline. Her introduction of new characters into the familiar legend is seamless as she weaves these fine threads into a tapestry of gallant deeds, sinister villains, damsels in distress, and courtly life.
