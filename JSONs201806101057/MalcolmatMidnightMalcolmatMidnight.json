Maybe I'm just a sucker for anthropomorphic animals, but Malcolm was great. Some of the secondary characters weren't quite as developed, but the important characters were all developed enough to be interesting and believable - especially Amelia and, to a lesser extent, Jovhan.The narration style was really interesting, and it's not something I think I've encountered before. Basically, it's written by a student as a note/explanation to his/her teacher. (It's left \"ambiguous\" who the student is, but it's really rather obvious.) See, Malcolm is a classroom pet to a fifth grade class, and when a missing ring turns up the teacher asks for an explanation for what happened - and the story is one student's explanation of the events which lead up the ring's return.It's also a sort of dictated memoir, as Malcolm must pass on the details of the story to the author, being unable to write himself. (But, because this is a kid's book, he can read and, using books, point out the words to tell his tale. (Which just requires some suspension of disbelief - not just in the ability, but in the short amount of time such a thing takes in the story, when I can't help but imagine it would take forever.))It's also a mystery story - not about the ring, which is actually ancillary, but because the Malcolm must discover what Snip, the villain of the story, has planned and who is helping her.But, for me, it was the characters that really made this book shine.Malcolm is a rat - but he's small, and mistaken for a mouse. He learns that people, and even that other school pets, don't like rats, because they're considered dirty thieves and liars - but Malcolm wants to show that not all rats are bad.It's really a story about not judging people based on surface traits, on getting to know people, and about figuring out who the real you is, and being the best you can be.I think it's a great story for kids, with lots of great little lessons, and was a treat for me to read as well."}, {"userName": "Eden", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5352308-eden", "userReview": "Let's talk about this book's narration, because holy wow is it unique: written to the class's teacher from the students, the narrator addresses him as \"you, Mr. Binney\". It's subtle but effective. And footnotes linking to \"vocabulary words\" or hilarious commentary on specific students in the class are definite funny highpoints, a burst of awesome in each chapter.That being said, Malcolm isn't distanced at all from the reader due to the narration style. In fact, it'd be nigh impossible not to relate to him, thanks to the identity struggles he goes through. His interactions with the students and other classroom pets alike make him utterly endearing, someone to cheer for.Speaking of the students and pets -- alll of the side characters are so amazingly developed it's mindboggling. The little quirks of the students and teachers both flesh them out and create that tangible, authentic classroom air. The pets are larger-than-life, from the tarantula (Lance?) to the sister-and-brother hamster duo. Even minor characters like Snip and the barn owl (sorry, I'm forgetting names) are very much 3D. Also, my favourite human? Johan. (Hopefully I'm remembering his name right...!) THIS KID, GUYS. <3Now, the mystery. Oh, is it a mystery. Red herrings, multiple suspects and hidden motivations propel this storyline non-stop as Malcolm adventures throughout the whole school and even to the great outisde. Beck uses her entire school to map out the action, from the creepy, disused 4th floor to the underground boiler room.Malcolm at Midnight also has: a villain you can empathize with. A twist-and-turn mystery. And hilariousness when you least expect it. This is by far my best read of 2013 so far.*Review originally published at Pass the Chiclets."}, {"userName": "Caroline Akervik", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8687131-caroline-akervik", "userReview": "Malcolm is a rat who is suffering an identity crisis of sorts. He aspires to be a rat of \u201cvalor and merit,\u201d a heroic rat. The problem is that his friends at the McKenna School, both human and animal, are suspicious of rats in general and mistake him for a mouse. Honey Bunny, one of the leaders of Midnight Academy, despises rats and claims that they are \u201cskuzzy garbage-eaters who lie and cheat.\u201d Malcolm aspires to be the rat he is inside, the rat he is when he is alone at midnight, while striving to save the McKenna School and the nutters who attend it from the evil plottings of a desperately evil villain, the cat Snape.Malcolm is an heroic and compelling protagonist. Readers come to care deeply for him. The characterization of all of the animals in the story, from Malcolm, to Snip, to Aggy the iguana, and Beert, the great snowy owl, is particularly strong. These characters come to life in a reader\u2019s mind, as do the nutters and Mr. Binney and Ms. Brumble.Beck includes clever little footnotes throughout and the lovely illustrations by Brian Lies bring the story to life. Malcolm is an adventure with many unexpected twists and turns. Some of the magic of the story is in the details, from the symbols left by the members of the Midnight Academy for each other, to the descriptions of Malcolm\u2019s three story cage, to the dust and grime of the upper floors of the McKenna school. Indeed, the descriptions are incredibly vivid. I could smell Snape\u2019s foul breath and hear her raspy voice.Malcolm at Midnight should be on every must read middle grade fiction list along with The Adventures of Edward Tulane and the Tale of Despereaux.Malcolm purports to be about a mouse, but it\u2019s more universal than that. Readers come away from it reflecting on who we are at midnight, whether we are the individuals of valor and merit whom we may wish to be."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622773-sara", "userReview": "Malcolm at Midnight by W.H.

Malcolm must use his smarts and wits and his human friends to clear his name and to help save the school.I loved this book. Malcom was delightful and his relationships with the other pets and his classmates were fun to read. The book is narrated by a mystery writer to the teacher and there are lots of footnotes defining the vocabulary words that the narrator adds to the story. The book has a bit of everything friendship, adventure, mystery and even a touch of romance and the pictures are fantastic. I tore through the book enchanted at every turn, this is a book I will be buying for gifts.Appropriateness: This is a fantastic book that will be enjoyed by the middle grade audience.

This is the type of book that is such a great find as a bookseller, as it is so easy to hand a book like this to any parent or grandparent looking for a gift for a middle grader: It is super cute, gender-neutral, and totally appropriate as either a read-aloud or for independent readers. It\u2019s got a classic feel, but unlike the \u201cbig name\u201d books, the giftee is almost guaranteed not to already own it.

Malcolm will steal your heart! He meets a secret society in the school called the Midnight Academy, which is made up of classroom pets who look out for the nutters (kids). Unfortunately, since rats have a bad reputation, Malcolm lets the misunderstanding go uncorrected that he's a mouse. One day the Academy leader, an iguana named Aggy, disappears, and Malcolm is under suspicion for committing the crime. He must prove that he is a rat of merit and valor and rescue Aggy. This book reminds me of a cross between The Rats of Nimh and Tale of Desperaux (which is a book read aloud in the story).

The later into the plot we got (especially what I discuss below), the more the elements felt very convenient and pat. Initially while I was reading, I thought the story was going to be played very straight and clich\u00e9: \u201cSnip kidnaps the Academy\u2019s leader, Malcolm would find her, proving that not all rats were bad, and Honey Bunny and the others would apologize to him.\" Boring. But when I saw that Snips\u2019 plot was a lot more devious and deadly then what I'd initially guessed, I was actually surprised. I think Honey Bunny (who I hate because he's such as jerk and got away with entirely too much) should've been working with Snip, because he made a better villain then a hero to me. Or the author should\u2019ve just let him die on the clock tower (which could\u2019ve been a good lesson -- see where blind hate gets you? And why couldn\u2019t there have been some causalities on the heroes\u2019 side?). Instead he survives because there were some tents below him. Come on. Honey Bunny (who I'll be calling HB from here on out) had no redeeming qualities. Snip had a backstory that made you feel bad for her (it didn\u2019t excuse what she did and was going to do), and she was the major villain. HB's sad backstory? \"He had a rat as his pledge, and the rat wanted to go live outside. HB doesn\u2019t like to make mistakes, so he hates rats now.\" I also thought the narrative trying to equate Malcolm's thinking HB was a villain with HB's bigoted attitude towards him was really weak, unneeded, and not even the same thing. Heck, I thought HB was going to be the bad guy. He smacked Malcolm in the face and then later attacked him. But Malcolm is just as bad for thinking he's guilty? Really?? That dog don\u2019t hunt. So I\u2019m sorry, but at the end, his apology to Malcolm didn't make me start liking him or forgive him for his misdeeds. If anything, I was thinking I didn\u2019t want to read another book with the character in it. I thought it would\u2019ve been really interesting to have the cute widdle rabbit be a genuine powerful (both physically and in terms of the power he wielded among the Academy) villain. Plus, the book never explained why his back leg was bandaged up earlier.There were plot elements i enjoyed. I like the idea of focusing on classroom pets and them having a little secret club. I felt genuinely creeped out when Malcolm and his human friend realize Snip had been at the school for twenty years. I like that the humans weren't stereotypes, or defied them (dumb class bully, a cartoonish bumbling or antagonistic janitor, etc). I gathered what was going on with Mr. Binney and the janitor pretty early on, but was cute. I like Malcolm. I kept wanting him to just form his own little club."}, {"userName": "Christopher", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63718961-christopher", "userReview": "I had passed this book several times at the library, debating whether or not I should try it.

When the lights shut down at McKenna Academy, Malcolm's new home, he discovers the Midnight Academy a secret society of classroom pets who meet at midnight to discuss how to protect their school. The venerable iguana Aggy Pop is the head of Midnight Academy; her deputies include Honey Bunny (much tougher than he sounds), twin hamsters Jesse James and Billy the Kid, grumpy fish Oscar, and, of course, a tarantula named Octavius (ingenious wordplay). One night Aggy goes missing, and Malcolm, eager to prove that rats can be noble, decides to search for her.Malcolm at Midnight was a wonderful surprise. I was hooked from the opening chapter thanks to W. H. Beck's unique writing style, which spoke directly to the teacher (Mr. Binney) and included clever footnotes. I read the entire book in two sittings; I simply had to find out what happened to these characters. As others have mentioned, the characters are wonderful, particularly the complex villain Snip.

Mr. Mark Binney, a fifth grade teacher at McKenna Elementary school who is looking for a mouse to be the class pet, purchases Malcolm at the pet store. The owner is out of mice, so he substitutes Malcolm. Who will ever know since Malcolm is so small, and what\u2019s the difference anyway? (Plenty, if you ask Malcolm! Like tails, and whiskers and intelligent black eyes.) During Malcolm's first night at McKenna School, he escapes his cage and meets the other school pets in the library. Led by Aggy, the iguana, they have formed a sort of protection agency for the school known as the Midnight Academy, a secret society, that meets when students and teachers have gone home. They work to keep McKenna School safe for themselves, as well as the nutters (children) and lankies (adults).  Aggy is willing to accept Malcom as a new member, but the others are not so sure. Honey Bunny, smells a rat, and rats are not welcome, so Malcolm continues the pretense that he is a mouse even though he longs to prove that he is a rat of valor and merit. Snip, the cat, plays the villain in this book. She was once a pet herself but was abandoned by her little girl. She lives hidden and alone in the school plotting her revenge on the students. When Aggy, goes missing, the Midnight Academy members blame Malcolm, so it becomes doubly important for him to find Aggy, to clear his name and the reputation of rats, and foil Snip\u2019s evil plot.I absolutely loved this book. I found it to be a wonderfully refreshing read, filled with great characters, (both animal and human, good and evil) engaging, high- level vocabulary, and moral lessons. There are mysteries to be solved, plenty of action and even a touch of romance. That does not mean, however, the book is without its flaws. Here are some things that I consider the pros and cons of Malcolm at MidnightProsAll the characters in this book are very well written. Malcolm is charming and brave and makes a fantastic hero. Snip is clearly deranged but in a sad way that it makes her madness more melancholy rather than diabolical. All the members of the Academy are well developed and very likable. The human characters in this book are also well written even though they are secondary characters. The book is written from a truly unique perspective. The story takes place in retrospect written as a note to Mr. Binney from an anonymous source. The liberal use of footnotes disguised as vocabulary definitions adds a different look and feel to the book. This is high-level vocabulary made fun. The animals also have their own unique vocabulary (nutters) and expressions. (Gristle!)This is an animal fiction story with a purpose. \u201cA critter reveals his true self at midnight. It means the way you are when no one is looking \u2013 that\u2019s the critter you really are.\u201d (p36) Isn't this true for humans as well? Hopefully readers will come away from it reflecting on who they are at midnight, whether they are the individuals of valor and merit whom they wish to be.The illustrations by Brian Lies (Bats at the Library) are soft black and white sketches that are wonderfully expressive. They really help the characters come to life without distracting from the story.The story takes place in Wisconsin, my home state!ConsThe story is a bit long winded and the nonstop action is sometimes confusing. The perspective of the story could be confusing unless the reader catches on early that the book is written for Mr. Binney, after the fact, by an unknown student. This book would make a great read aloud but the many footnotes on each page pose a problem for this.Some aspects of the book strain credibility like how Malcolm communicates with a student by pointing to words in the dictionary, but then again, this is animal fiction!It\u2019s hard to believe that a young woman such as Veronica Brumble is the janitor of the school and that there are so many closed off and unused and unknown parts of the school.Some plot elements seem somewhat convoluted or poorly explained. But then again, this is animal fiction!.Overall There you have it. The pros outweigh the cons. I thought this was a fantastic book with great writing, plot devices, well-developed characters, and winsome illustrations. In some ways it reminded me very much of Toy Story, and like Toy Story, I think it would make a wonderful movie. Malcolm at Midnight should appeal equally to girls and boys and has some great vocabulary for growing readers. I would recommend this book to readers ages 10-14, and it would also be wonderful for younger more advanced readers who are reading above grade level but aren't quite ready for heavier emotional or thematic content. There is plenty of room for a sequel or two and hopefully they will be coming soon!"}, {"userName": "Nathan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72142929-nathan", "userReview": "This book is about a small rat that everyone thinks is a mouse gets adopted to a school.

Sneaky? Evil? Untrustworthy? Well don't believe everything that you read in books. Rats aren't all bad--and Malcolm is determined to prove that even though he is a rat he can still be have valor and merit like everyone else in Mr. Binney's classroom. Of course, Mr. Binney wouldn't have bought Malcolm in the first place if he didn't think he was a mouse. It's not Malcolm's fault he's so small though. As if being mistaken for a mouse wasn't enough Mr. Binney started reading The Tale of Despereaux 'in his honor'-a story where the rats are horrible, scheming creatures. Even the other class pets are prejudiced against rats. It will be hard for Malcolm to prove his worth with everyone against him, but maybe if he can solve the mystery of the spy that's trying to bring down the school, he will finally be able to prove that rats can indeed be trusted.I love the premise and I have noticed the unfair portrayal of rats in children's literature before. This is a fun, humorous story but it could easily lead to further discussions of prejudice and how people may be misjudged. The idea that all the class pets meet after hours to keep the school safe has a lot of appeal. They extend the theme of judging based on appearances in little ways throughout the novel such as having the bunny character speak with a deep voice and act like a tough guy. Malcolm steals the show though, and it's easy to root for him as he struggles with problems big and small from trying to do the right thing to giving up chewing his whiskers. The ample pictures provide great, engaging snapshots of the action and include wonderful detail in the very human expressions on the animals' faces. The story is written as a long note to the teacher and my favorite part is the meta-humor contained in the footnotes. The narrator tells extra tidbits about the students to Mr. Binney and notes when he uses vocabulary words and includes the definitions to show he was paying attention. Of course, this also helps stretch and build the vocabulary of the reader. Between all the pets and all the humans there's a lot of characters and not all of them get the chance to be fleshed out beyond two dimensions. This is particularly true of the human characters. The perfect little girl character is entirely too perfect for my tastes and the teachers seem to have literally no life outside of school--all their romances and even events of significance in the past (thanks to their attending the school as children) take place on campus. I'd give this to students looking for a mystery and pet-lovers 3rd grade and up.

Indeed, there are a lot of similarities at first. Soon, however, this story of Malcolm, a rat who is rather small and is mistaken for a mouse, takes a turn. The other classroom pets meet at midnight. They have club with rules and regulations and goals. They also have a strong prejudice against rats. Malcolm wants to be a meaningful member of their group, but he's already irritated at least one member, and in trying to redeem himself has only further alienated the group. In the meantime there's plenty of inference about a romance between two of the \"lankies\" (humans), and there's a dangerous cat who has a plan for vengeance and a strange ghost legend involving the clock tower. Malcolm has to decide who he is, and what he wants, and what he's willing to risk to get it. The story picks up pace nicely and has some nice moments. The author's use of frequent footnotes is designed to add tidbits and another viewpoint, but quickly grows annoying because it interrupts the flow of the story. I finally quit reading them entirely, and found the book much more satisfying after making that decision. Still, that's a small quibble. This is a fun, suspenseful book that stands well on its own and will appeal to fans of Birney's series."}, {"userName": "Dolly", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly", "userReview": "This is an entertaining story about school pets. They are given anthropomorphic characteristics and the main character, Malcolm, even communicates with humans. The story reminds me of the According to Humphrey series by Betty G. Birney, but much darker and for a slightly older age group. We selected this book for our girls' local library book club and it was a fun, fast read. Great for summer reading. interesting quote:\"Have you ever noticed that when you do something distasteful - like diving into a toilet, for example - it's not quite as disgusting if it's something you choose to do? Kind of like hot lunch. If you take it because you decided to sleep late and not make a lunch, that's one thing. You can live with a sausage pancake on a stick. But if you have to take hot lunch because you left your perfectly good peanut butter and banana sandwich on the bus and there's no way your mom can bring another to school for you because she has a meeting and she's mad at you anyway because you forgot your jacket the day before? Well, that sausage pancake on a stick is a lot harder to swallow.\" (pp. 235-236)"}, {"userName": "Kidsmomo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14167682-kidsmomo", "userReview": "Review by Karen, intended for young readers:If you\u2019ve read Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, then you know that some rats can be very smart and very brave. In that book, it\u2019s only a small group of rats who could be that way \u2014 and I won\u2019t spoil it for those who haven\u2019t read the book by telling you why.

You guessed it \u2014 I\u2019m talking about a rat named Malcolm!Malcolm starts life as a pet store rat, but his adventures start when he is purchased as a school pet \u2014 except he\u2019s mistaken for a mouse! And that really seems to matter to some of the other school pets, who long ago formed the Midnight Academy, a group that secretly keeps the school safe and running smoothly unbeknownst to the humans.As part of the Academy, Malcolm would be sure to have an interesting time anyway \u2014 but when he gets kicked out of the group after they discover he\u2019s a rat and think he\u2019s responsible for a pet-napping, well, Malcolm is about to experience some real excitement (and danger!) as he tries to clear his name.If you love Mrs. Frisby, Despereaux, and Ripred, I\u2019d suggest it\u2019s time for you to meet Malcolm!Review copy from the publisher.This review also appears on Kidsmomo.com."}], "description": "When Malcolm the rat arrives as the pet at McKenna School, he revels in the attention.
