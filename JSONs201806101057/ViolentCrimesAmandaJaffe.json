I love this author. He is so good and I did like this a lot, it did have lots of suspense and it was an easy fast read but it just felt like it was missing something. This is the fifth book in the Amanda Jaffe series and I loved all of them and this one was my least favorite.My favorite book by this author is Gone but Not Forgotten and I have a funny story to go with it. I truly loved this book and I carried it with me wherever I would go and one of the days that I carried it, I went to numerous places. Well I lost the book when I came home so I went back to the last place where I went and that was the pharmacy and I asked them if they found a book and they asked me what is the name of it and I said its Gone but not forgotten and the pharmacist said OK its gone and you will not forget it but what is the title and I said I told you that is the name of the book, its called Gone and not Forgotten, and he had the book and he gave it to me and we both laughed so hard. It I st made my day. I just had to share that.I am sure that there are lots of Philip Margolin fands and I am one of them.What the title promises it sure does delivers: another torrent of violent crimes for Oregon defense attorney Amanda Jaffe.Christine Larson, of Masterson, Hamilton, Rickman, and Thomas, wants Amanda to defend Tom Beatty, a former Navy SEAL with PTSD who\u2019s working as a paralegal at the firm. Harold Roux, a bully who started a bar fight with Beatty, has sworn out a complaint from his hospital bed. Amanda gets the charge dismissed without breaking a sweat, unaware that the real trouble is just beginning. Someone murders Christine, plants her body in Beatty\u2019s place, and sends Detective Greg Nowicki, of Portland Narcotics, there on a trumped-up tip that Beatty\u2019s selling heroin. The cops pick up Beatty, but Amanda assures him she\u2019ll get bail for him, because she\u2019s certain Christine was killed by Dale Masterson, Mark Hamilton, or one of the other higher-ups in the firm whose falsified financial statements Christine had been looking into. Amanda, as good as her word, springs Beatty from police custody just in time for Masterson to get murdered. The presumption of Beatty\u2019s guilt would be overwhelming if only Dale\u2019s son, Brandon, hadn\u2019t been spotted running from the murder scene covered in blood. In fact, Brandon, an environmental activist bent on using his trial as a platform to broadcast his father\u2019s misdeeds to the world, is only too eager to confess to the murder, but Amanda doesn\u2019t believe him, and soon enough she\u2019s gotten herself hired as his attorney even though getting him off may involve implicating Beatty, who\u2019s also her client.This last problem may sound like a thorny ethical dilemma, but it\u2019s just as weightless as every other complication in this fleet, guileless, inch-deep yarn, a tale guaranteed to get you to bed in plenty of time and leave your dreams untroubled.Now you are probably wondering why I only gave this book 3.5 stars. Well I did like it a lot but I guess I wanted more suspense, it did have suspense but just didn't have enough action that I look for in my thrillers. I did love this series and I think this is the last book of this series."}, {"userName": "Kaceey - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13442817-kaceey---traveling-sister", "userReview": "This is a very fast enjoyable read with short chapters.

The author neatly arranged the chapters to be refreshingly short. This allowed for frequent brief interludes for collection of thought. The well-paced narrative barreled its way through beginning to end. It kept me on the edge of my seat. And just when I assumed I had the ending all figured out, or mostly, I had been thrown for a loop. It was an unexpected landing that I never saw coming. Bravo.The heroine, Criminal Defense Attorney Amanda Jaffe was paid a professional visit by a colleague, Christine Larson. Christine's paralegal Tom Brady had a complaint filed against him for fighting in a bar. As you might guess, he won. The charges were later dropped but this incident was a catalyst that propelled Tom, an ex-seal, into a series of murders and cover-ups. His quiet life had taken a nosedive.Christine was a junior partner of a Law Firm that had in recent times been struggling, financially. In fact, it was on the verge of bankruptcy. A corporate giant had considered moving its services to this firm. Once agreed upon, it would have meant millions in revenue to the sinking firm. Only there was a major problem that stood in it's way - Christine.The senior partners Masterson and Hamilton knew they would lose this client if it was discovered that their firm faced financial difficulties. That, they could not afford. Their only option available, at least the only one they considered, was to \"cook the books\". A highly illegal, inflated revenue of the firm would ensure the contract and its survival. They enlisted Christine's help in presenting the financials to the potential client. While reviewing the report, she quickly realized that the income reported was inaccurate. Actually, it was more than deceptive, it was a downright lie. It was unethical and she didn't want any part of it. This put her in a terrible predicament. She argued her case with her boss but could find no common ground with him. Flat-out, she refused to cooperate even though it would mean the end of her career. To the firm, if this information went public, it would be a disaster. They would be ruined. She was now more of a multimillion-dollar liability than an asset. They saw no other way. She needed to be silenced."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18983476-bill", "userReview": "2\u2606 \u2022\u2022\u2022 begrudgingly!OK boys and girls, if you were on the planet in the 1960s you remember Bubble Gum rock right? 1910 Fruitgum Company, Ohio Express (Yummy yummy yummy I got love in my tummy and...), Lemon Pipers???This book is the literary equivalent.

I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.I remember reading \u201cGone, but Not Forgotten\u2019, way back in the early 1990\u2019s, and was blown away by it. I even managed to talk my husband into reading it, which is no easy feat. So, needless to say, I\u2019ve been a fan of Philip Margolin\u2019s for a very long time. However, I have not read one of his novels in a while, so I was eager to dive into this latest installment in the Amanda Jaffe series. When Amanda is approached by Christine Larson, a colleague who works for a prestigious law firm, asking her to take on the case of a paralegal, a war veteran with PTSD, who snapped, and ended up in a bar fight, and is now facing charges, Amanda is happy to help out. But, when Christine is murdered, and her new client becomes the number one suspect, Amanda\u2019s case suddenly becomes much more serious. Amanda is positive Tom is innocent, and soon discovers that Christine\u2019s law firm is having some financial difficulties and Christine was suspicious about the checks and balances, which, frankly, just didn\u2019t add up. But, when Dan Masterson, another member of the firm, is murdered, a senior partner, no less, the focus turns away from Tom and onto Dan\u2019s son, Brandon. Now Amanda finds herself serving both clients, and peeling back layers of cover-ups, controversy, and conspiracy. One thing I am noticing about legal thrillers these days, is the lack of a real courtroom presence. No legal wrangling, no judge or jury, or witnesses, which is really sad because some of the best thrillers I\u2019ve ever read were courtroom dramas. Today, with the reality being that lawyers work to make plea bargains to avoid the cost of a court trial, in novels, attorneys will wind up becoming amateur sleuths, instead of delegating the investigation, while they focus on motions and other lawyerly things. So, the one thing I did like about this book, was the courtroom scenes. While they were not overly exiting, they were at least included, so this book can be considered a true legal thriller. Other than that, I\u2019m afraid this installment in the Jaffe series did not live up to the standards set in previous chapters in this series. It was okay, but for a person like myself, who needs a real challenge, it was a little too bland and predictable, and as much as it pains me to say this, a little boring. Not only that, the coda, which was intended to invoke uneasiness, bombed big time. While the ending highlighted the moral dilemmas any defense attorney has probably faced at one time or another, the outline Amanda presents is so preposterous, I was rolling my eyes and trying not to laugh, which is not the best way for a book to end. Like I have said on numerous occasions, every author hits a snag once in a while, so maybe this is just one of those occasions and any further releases in this series will be back on track. I certainly hope so! 2.5 rounded to 3"}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt", "userReview": "In another of his legal thrillers, Margolin places Amanda Jaffe at the centre of a number of high-intensity events. After a bar fight goes wrong, Tom Beatty comes to Jaffe for assistance in getting the charges dropped. Beatty returns to work as a paralegal and ends up embroiled in a heated argument with a colleague, Christine Larson. After Larson's body is found in Beatty's home, he's taken into custody and Jaffe's is retained once more. At a hearing, a legal technicality prevents a significant amount of evidence from being allowed and Beatty is released on conditional bail. Dale Masterson, senior partner in the firm that employed both Larson and Beatty is in cahoots with his fellow partner, Mark Hamilton, on a project Larson discovered before her death, one about which Beatty was also aware. Masterson is found dead in his home and Brendan Masterson, the disgruntled son, is seen fleeing the scene. Much evidence points towards Brendan and he does not deny killing his father. Jaffe is retained to Masterson at trial and seeks to get to the root of the slaying. Jaffe soon discovers that the murder has very close similarities to that of Larson, leaving her unconvinced that her new client is responsible. With Beatty nowhere to be found, his degree of guilt rises exponentially and Jaffe must find him to determine how all these murders tie together. Facing the need to put on the defence of a lifetime, Jaffe takes a leap of faith in hopes that she can save both her clients from death row. Margolin weaves a complex, yet highly entertaining, story into a compact novel and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat until the final sentence, literally.I have often enjoyed the work that Margolin creates, as it is a wonderful mix of legal drama and nuanced character development. He gets to the root of the story and captures the writer's attention while not getting too bogged down in legal minutiae. I was not sure where things were going, with Beatty's initial charges under the Larson murder, but once things began developing, they fell nicely into place and created a mystery layered atop a wonderful legal thriller. While it has been a while since last I read any Amanda Jaffe, she is a refreshing character and one the reader will enjoy for a long time to come.Kudos, Mr. Margolin for another great story. I enjoy how you can cram so much and keep things moving so effectively.Like/hate the review?

While his books are not literary masterpieces or books that leave you winded in a good way after finishing one, you knew that when you started one of his books, you\u2019d finish it. You\u2019d enjoy the book, kill a few days and hey, isn\u2019t that what a book is supposed to do?Lately, however, I think Mr. Margolin has lost something. Every once in a while you come across an author who has lost \u2018the edge\u2019 and seems to be just going through the motions of churning out a new novel, knowing it will be successful based solely on his name and his fans.His earlier works were very good novels. But his last several efforts have, in my opinion, gotten progressively worse.Sleight of Hand, written a few years ago, was a step back. No big deal. It happens. After that he wrote Worthy Brown\u2019s Daughter. This WAS an interesting novel in that it shows what the legal system was like in the 1800\u2019s if you were black. Interesting, yes. Well-researched, yes. But it read more like non-fiction. Then came \u2018Woman with a Gun\u2019 which was awful. This was the first Margolin book I could not manage to get through.I just picked up \u201cViolent Crimes.\u201d Three hours later I gave up on Violent Crimes. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it\u2019s a fast-moving book. I read about 135 in 2 \u00bd hours. Yet, even though the book was only 290 and that I read almost half, I decided not to finish. When you get to the almost halfway point in a novel and don\u2019t care what happens, why continue?There are 2 things that, to me, make a book enjoyable. One is character development. I\u2019ve stressed this in many of my reviews and I want to be able to connect with the characters on some level, to identify with them. I want to cheer the good guy and boo the bad guy. Harlan Coben, for example: Most of his novels are great. Some however are not up to Coben-standards. However, I\u2019ve never NOT finished a Coben book. Even if the plot itself isn\u2019t anything great I will complete the book cause I want to know what happens to the characters.The characters in Violent Crimes, including the recurring protagonist Amanda Jaffe, are all boring, bland and cardboard. They are one-dimensional with no depth. You find yourself rooting for Amanda Jaffe simple cause\u2026well, she\u2019s the main character. The second thing I look for in a good book are plot twists and turns. I love books that keep you guessing, that throw you for a loop. I just finished \u201cThe God\u2019s Eye View\u201d by Barry Eisler and that had twists and turns until the last page. After reading almost half of Violent Crimes, there was not one unexpected event. It was boring and very predictable. I will say, in all honesty, I\u2019m not a big fan of legal thrillers. I\u2019m not a fan of Paul Madriani and have never gotten into John Grisham. However, I LOVE Mickey Haller and am a fan of Lisa Scottoline\u2019s legal books. Yet, even in Violent Crimes, the legal scenes were boring and very dry. They read not like a novel but\u2026well, like a legal document. In addition to the cardboard characters is one glaring blunder in the book.We are all different. We all talk different. We all use different terminology, different jargon and different language. Perhaps it\u2019s based on age. (I use different expressions than my mom.) Perhaps its based on education. Someone with a PHD from Stanford speaks differently than a 14 year old HS drop out. We talk different based on what kind of job we have. A defense attorney or a well respected politician uses different words than a 15 yea-old kid working at McDonalds. It\u2019s also based even on what part of the country we live in. A Hoagie, a Hero and a Sub are all the same type of sandwich. I say \u201cCoke\u201d whereas others say soda. If you\u2019re from Chicago, you say \u201cpop.\u201d Yet, every character in Violent Crimes uses the same terminology. Sorry, but that\u2019s not real. Amanda, a middle-aged lawyer would not speak the same as her father, as police detectives, as a Navy Seal and as a twenty-something \u2018toubled kid.\u2019 Yet, in this book, they all talk the same.I\u2019m giving this book only 2 stars simply because it\u2019s fast moving."}, {"userName": "James Fitzgerald", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30578728-james-fitzgerald", "userReview": "This was a fast paced easy read legal thriller although the ending had a twist I was not impressed I think the writing was good not great it kept me entertained and I guess that is what it is suppose to do."}, {"userName": "Jerry B", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3901425-jerry-b", "userReview": "Margolin is one of our \u201cB\u201d-list authors \u2013 whereby we normally read all his books, to an average 3-star rating.

In this tale, paralegal Tom Beatty winds up accused of murder, though we readers know he\u2019s not guilty \u2013 moreover, the police are lackadaisical about alternatives despite many signs of a frame-up. Virtually the whole center of the book slogs along as more deaths occur, more clues appear, etc. We finally learn whodunit in an admittedly suspenseful last third of the novel, but by then we\u2019re a little tired of waiting.At least Margolin, another lawyer turned writer, avoided overpopulating this book with stick characters (one of our frequent criticisms), but we wound up wishing a sharper editor had carved half of that dull-midsection away to reveal more meat.

Her cadence and tone matches the highs and lows of the story. Plummer brings the emotions to the surface as she portrays the characters enhancing this fascinating story.Veteran attorney Amanda Jaffe is asked by her friend Christine Larson to defend a fellow colleague, Tom Beatty, in a bar room brawl case. Tom is ex-military suffering from PTSD. Shortly after Amanda gets Tom released from the charge, Christine is found brutally beaten to death in Tom\u2019s bedroom.Amanda once again tried to help Tom and discovers Christine was looking into possible fraud involving her boss Dale Masterson at the law firm of Masterson, Hamilton, Rickman and Thomas where she and Tom worked. As the business practices of the law firm come under surveillance, Dale Masterson is found beaten to death in his mansion. Dale\u2019s son, Brandon, is seen fleeing the house and is arrested for the murder. Amanda is hired to represent Brandon even though he confesses to killing his father for dealing with questionable clients that he claims are destroying the earth.Amanda begins to think there could be a connection between Dale and Christine\u2019s murders. The more she digs deeper, the darker the situation becomes. Amanda puts her life in danger determined to find Christine\u2019s killer and find justice for her two clients as she wonders if one of them really is a killer.This is a fast-pace story that has several plots going on at the same time before coming together in a surprised ending. The suspense and tension will keep you wondering what will happen next. While you might be able to figure out a few of the main bad guys, the author throws in a few twists to surprise you.The characters are realistic and well-developed. The protagonist is a strong, determined and feisty female, but shows a vulnerable side as well.VIOLENT CRIMES is the fifth installment in the Amanda Jaffe series, but can be read/listened to on its own.

Only Tom was heard having a heated argument with Christine shortly before she died.Tom says the argument was because Christine had found out their company partners had doctored the books to make the company appear more attractive to clients. When she asked Tom to help her prove it, he refused. He was comfortable in his job, didn't want to make waves and didn't want to jeopardise his job by looking into this matter. Only he couldn't prove it.Then people started dying. Tom went on the lam, trying to find Christine's killer and to save himself at the same time.Interesting characters, good plot line and a well woven story."}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6176572-shelley", "userReview": "I knew I had read a book last week but couldn't remember the title or the author so I had to go find it to remember. What I remember is lots of brutal killing and wishing I hadn't bothered with it. I know I read and like something else by the author but darned if I can remember which even after looking at the titles and descriptions.

This one did not keep me on the edge of my seat, but was well written entertaining. I love the Portland setting. It makes me nostalgic for the years l lived there.
