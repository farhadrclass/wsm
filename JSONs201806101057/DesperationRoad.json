I didn't read any of the reviews before I went into this book, which was probably a good thing because I was able to experience everything fresh, without any idea of what was going to transpire. It ended up being quite a big surprise for me, but not in the way that you'd probably expect.You see, McComb, Mississippi is my hometown...and it is the setting of this story. My family has a very long history in this small southern town. In fact, my grandmother's uncle - my great, great uncle - was McComb's Chief of Police in the 1920's. He is one of 3 officers that have been killed in the line of duty in the history of McComb's police force. He was gunned down when serving a warrant for forged checks. His murderer escaped and an international manhunt ensued, with the murderer being caught in Canada and eventually hung in Magnolia.Going into this story, I had absolutely no idea of where the story was set and it caught me off guard. While other readers were engrossed in the story, I found myself lost to a strong case of nostalgia. I haven't been back in years, since I was a young teen, but as the author described Delaware Avenue and the angular arches of Centenary United Methodist Church, it felt like I was right back there again. I could so easily picture the surrounding towns, like Magnolia, and the businesses like the Fernwood Truck Stop that the author described. He really did a fantastic job of accurately portraying the geography and physical lay of the land.That being said, because I spent so much time reminiscing, I did find myself missing details of the story more than a few times. I was listening to the Audible version and had to \"rewind\" this story several times to reorient myself. For most listeners, this probably won't be a problem. It is always a little trickier to stay abreast of what's going on when listening to a story that bounces between multiple characters, but this one was more difficult for me because I kept getting lost in my own memories.The story itself was suspenseful and utterly captivating. Alongside the vivid descriptions of the town and surrounding areas, a full cast of characters makes this story stand out. Everyone in this book has a story to tell. The secrets, betrayals and motivations are many.The two characters that are the central focus of this story are on separate paths, not intersecting until you are well into the story. As the story unfolds, past and present collide. Will they be offered the chance to redeem themselves?Russell Gaines has just been released from prison, after serving time for killing a young man. He returns to his hometown, where the brothers of his victim have been awaiting his release - and their revenge - for the duration of his imprisonment. As with other characters, the details of his past are revealed little by little.Maben is wandering alongside the Interstate when we first meet her. Every possession she owns is carried in the trash bag thrown over her shoulder. Along with her young daughter, Annalee, she trudges on toward the town she hasn't been to in years. She is a much-changed version of the girl she was when she left her hometown. Addiction and loss have left their mark on her. In an act of desperation, she jeopardizes the only good thing that she has left in her life.Overall, I thought that this was a fantastic and engaging read. I will probably go back to it at some point to catch the details that I suspect that I've missed while I was reminiscing. Even so, it was a great story that kept me guessing right to the very end. This author sucked me right in to the plight of these characters. It is my first book by Michael Farris Smith, but will not be my last."}, {"userName": "Paromjit", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit", "userReview": "Michael Farris Smith has written an effortlessly erudite, complex and lucid novel of consequence set in the ravaged town of McComb, Mississippi. It tells of the travails of lives brimful of pain unravelling under the relentless and searing southern heat. It displays a bone deep understanding of Southern traditions and people, and in the narrative I could hear the timeless musical laments of jazz and blues singers such as Robert Johnson, Leadbelly and Bessie Smith. It is the story of Russell, released after 11 years of imprisonment and Maben, and her daughter, Annalee, fleeing a unspeakable scenario that results in a fatal shooting. Their paths cross, and certain actions and possibilities come into play. The focus is on the themes of alcohol and drug addiction, love, loss, regrets, redemption and dreams that slip away beyond reach. The tone is set when upon reaching McComb, Russell is welcomed by a vicious beating by Larry and Walt, the brothers of the man he killed. Russell sees that in the eyes of some people, no amount of atonement will suffice, not even the loss of his precious relationship with Sarah. Larry is exploding with visceral rage and hate ignited by the self hatred within him, driven to destroy all that he touches. Russell finds some solace in his father, who has begun a relationship with an ex-slave, Consuela, after his wife dies whilst Russell was still in prison. Maben struggles to find a place of rest and work and escape the consequences of her actions. She is slowly and inexorably sliding to a place where she is hanging by a thread and seeing nothing that can alleviate a desperate ending. Then she meets Russell, who upon hearing her tale, hopes to find redemption. Connections between the two of them become clearer later on.The expressive prose has a finesse and vitality that seamlessly ensnares the reader. The sharply drawn characters weave their way into your consciousness as real and authentic people. I imagine that as the author has a preacher for a father, that the themes of judgement, forgiveness and justice were points for constant discussion which then went on to inform this novel. There is certainly great symbolism in the concrete statue of the Virgin Mary in the book. I felt faint echoes of the biblical story of Job's suffering whilst I was reading. It is the author's ability to bring humanity to every character, irrespective of what they may have done, that marks this as an outstanding and superb read. Highly recommended.

For me, Desperation Road turned out to be one of those sometimes. It was Michael Farris Smith\u2019s distinct style\u2014his lack of frilly overtures and sometimes sparse dialogue, all delivered in a compelling way\u2014that struck a chord with me. There was a beauty to the simplicity of his writing, this cast of broken people, his ability to draw out my curiosity and the very question underlying it all\u2014should our lives be defined by the mistakes we make?The author holds his secrets close, revealing the big picture one sliver at a time; something I personally found utterly engaging. It's not a pretty story per se, but sort of humbling in all of it's desperation. Have I mentioned yet how aptly titled this book is?It was a horrible decision, made late one night, eleven years earlier, that set this cast of characters on a collision course or the same Mississippi road paved with desperation, if you will. Having spent all those years since, behind bars, paying for that bourbon-induced mistake, Russell is out and ready to live some type of life. Unfortunately for him, there are those that think he hasn\u2019t quite paid enough. \n\u201cMy road is the road that brought us all here led by what hand I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s the mysterious woman, Maben, with barely enough money for food, roaming the side the of highway and sleeping in the woods with her young daughter. What could have landed her on this road of discontent?Each complex and troubled in some way\u2014torn by what they\u2019ve been through or what\u2019s been done to them\u2014these characters don\u2019t make excuses for who they are, but instead own their flaws in some way. Despite everything, the most common thread was an underlying resilience and a much-needed reprieve from the darkness; the yearning to leave the past behind and move forward. While I wouldn't consider this particular story to be as gritty or dark as some of the other Grit-Lit or Southern-noir books I\u2019ve dabbled in, Desperation Road is still a worthy opponent. One that showed me the power of Michael Farris Smith's style and convinced me I need to check out his backlist.*Thank you to Little, Brown and Company and NetGalley for a copy in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "Yes, yes, YES! This book was amazing!!Does everyone deserve a second chance? Can we ever free ourselves from the yoke of the wrongs we've done, or are we destined to pay for them forever? Is hope something all should feel entitled to, or should we just accept that hope is a luxury not everyone can afford? These are just a few of the questions Michael Farris Smith addresses in his bleak, brilliant new novel, \nDesperation Road\n.Russell Gaines has just gotten out of prison after 11 years. He has spent that time thinking about a lot of things\u2014the mistake he made that landed him in jail, those who will continue to wish him harm even after his release, and the woman he loved, the woman he let go.\"...he was taken away from thoughts of his youth and forced into thoughts of the man he had been when he was taken away. He had told himself he wasn't going to do it. Wasn't going to stare out the window and lament what he had lost, like some hapless guy in some hapless moment but he wasn't able to resist.\"He's ready to start his life anew, even if he knows it won't be easy. But it isn't long at all before those seeking revenge are ready to wreak havoc on the rest of his life, even if he's done his time. And Russell must decide how to respond, how far to let them push him before he must push back.Meanwhile, a young woman named Maben is walking along the side of the highway with her young daughter, carrying all of their possessions in a garbage bag, hoping for a break. The sun is punishing, yet the pair soldiers on, and Maben hopes they can find someplace to wait out the heat, and then perhaps find temporary respite in a shelter until she figures out their next move. All her life, it seems, she has been running away from something, and she doesn't want to subject her daughter to these same mistakes.\"There were times when it was impossible to sleep as all the evil in the world seemed to gather in her thoughts and she couldn't figure out how to keep the child from it and there were other times when all the evil in the world gathered in her thoughts and exhausted her to the point where she couldn't fight it anymore.\"That night Maben is forced into a corner the likes of which she doesn't expect and fears she might not escape, so she acts instinctively, which only causes more trouble. She and her daughter must flee, but no matter where they go, no matter how they try to get a foothold, the mistake she made follows her and threatens to swallow them whole.One day, Russell and Maben cross paths in a moment of desperation. Neither wants anything to do with the other, but Russell feels like it is his responsibility to protect Maben and her daughter, even if he thinks she is hiding something major. When he finds out what she has done, he knows it's already too late to disentangle himself, and he has to decide whether to save himself or accept what will ultimately come his way. At the same time, Maben finds herself unwittingly involved in Russell's problems as well.This is really a phenomenal book. I'd never read anything Smith had written before, but I was captivated almost instantaneously by his prose, by his characters and the bleak world they lived in. At times I worried the book would become almost too depressing to bear, but it didn't.It is a testament to Smith's talent as a writer that you find yourself utterly immersed in this story of two people whom life really is battering about. He really paints a full picture for you\u2014strong characters, evocative setting, tension that ratchets up increasingly as you feel the locomotive of their troubles heading toward them. But I loved every minute of it. I rooted for Russell and Maben and hoped Smith might take their story in a different direction than I thought.Whenever I see so many people giving a book 5- and 4-star ratings I worry a lot that somehow its appeal might pass me by. Happily, that wasn't the case for me with \nDesperation Road\n. This might not be the most cheerful read, but it is truly evidence of an author's virtuoso performance, one which should absolutely be read.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo...."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "Retribution, revenge, mistakes that lead to life changing results, all qualities that populate many books of southern fiction. But in this author hands it is so much more. Flawed characters, realistic characters, but all treated with dignity and grace despite their bad decisions, decisions that linger, causing hurt and anger. How to get past these and start again? A wonderful and tightly plotted book, the pace is so even the writing extremely smooth. Suspenseful but at the same time heartbreaking.This is one of those books that begs to be read in one sitting, but I quite frankly didn't want to finish too quickly. Sure I wanted to see where it was going, what happens to these troubled characters but at the same time I didn't want it to be over. There is violence, a realistic small southern town setting, a father who will do anything for his son, a wonderful woman who though she spoke little English, was so incredibly helpful and understanding, and a police officer who has to make a decision that could affect his own future.

NOW AVAILABLE !!\u201cTrouble been doggin' my soul since the day I was born\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Ray LeMontagneWith the perfect ebb and flow of tension throughout this perfectly paced novel, Michael Farris Smith has drawn an incredible cast of characters who come together to create the perfect storm \u2013 a disturbance of the atmosphere between these characters and these pages. McComb, Mississippi is the setting for this story, which opens with the return of one of McComb\u2019s native sons returning home. McComb is one of the towns on the Mississippi Blues Trail with markers for some of the great Blues musicians. The marker for Bo Diddley can be found there, as can one for Summit Street. A \u201cthriving African American business district during the era of segregation as well as a hotbed of musical activity. Blues, Jazz and rhythm and blues bands entertained at various nightclubs, cafes, and hotels, and many musicians lived nearby. After the coming of Integration in the 1960s, commerce in Summit Street and similar areas in other cities began to decline when much of the African American trade dispersed to other parts of town.\u201dPicture this town in your mind, the old downtown area of Summit Street having likely fallen into some disrepair after the decline in commerce, maybe in the process of renovation, and the part of town where most of the town stores are looking like every old small town in America founded in the earlier years. Brick buildings side by side down a simple but wide road, likely street parking in front of the drugstore. A flagpole prominently displayed. A small Train Station. A family named / owned hotel. It still retains some of that look from the early years, in your mind\u2019s eye you can see the changes come as the automobiles changed from the era of the Model Ts to a Town Car, the Coupes, T-Birds, Mustangs\u2026 the clothing changing along with the cars. Small town America, southern style, but you might only notice the differences by staying for a bit. Everybody knows your name, everybody knows everybody else\u2019s business and claims to stay out of it, but you know how those tongues wag. It hasn\u2019t changed all that much in the years Russell\u2019s been gone. He could walk down the street and it\u2019s as if he steps right back into the heartbeat of the town. This is what Russell returns to when he heads home. But there\u2019s more. There\u2019s much more waiting for him than just his father. There\u2019s a welcoming committee, of sorts, to greet him as he gets off the bus. It\u2019s not exactly a warm, friendly welcome, more like a warning-welcome. Stay and expect more. Worse. Smith\u2019s prose has a powerful, yet elegant ease to it, keeping the tension subtle yet present throughout, pacing the unveiling to perfection. What comes to light when the past and future collide at the intersection of two lives destined to meet is a heartbreaking story of revenge, regrets, and redemption.Pub Date: 07 Feb 2017Many thanks for the ARC provided by Little, Brown and Company, NetGalley, and author Michael Farris Smith"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol", "userReview": "OK......I have a new favorite author..........Michael Farris Smith.Get ready for a blast-off beginning when you meet Maben and little Annabel struggling with heat and hunger as they walk the highway back to Mississippi, as they meet up with danger and as they live with disappointment after disappointment.In DESPERATION ROAD, Bourbon, Coke and Guns are the norm and ex-con Russell Gaines takes no exception to the rule.

Nor will you need any help finding your way back home following the Yellow Brick Road....\"Desperation Road\" takes place in a small town: McComb, (Pike County), in the state of Mississippi. McComb is about 80 miles south of Jackson and was founded in 1872 after Henry Simpson McComb of the New Orleans, Jackson and the Great Northern Railroad, a predecessor of the Illinois Central Railroad (now part of the Canadian National Railway), decided to move the railroads maintenance shops away from New Orleans, Louisiana, outside of the attractions of that city's saloons. During the 1960's, McComb and nearby areas was a site of extreme violence by KKK and other opponents to the Civil Rights Movement.Looking up some background information of the area of where this story takes place added to my 'already admiration' for the phenomenal author Michael Farris Smith. The passion a writer must 'feel' emotionally to write a book like this is so frickin real...with dignity, integrity, and purpose....I can't imagine how this didn't take on a life of its own - so much so - that Michael Farris Smith must have been breathing, eating, living, this novel 24 hours a day - as to have 'become it'.?/! This book is THAT FANTASTIC!!!!!I would be easy to write a separate review about 'every' character in this book, as they each have a very clear personality profile --each with their own troubled story. In other words - every character is well developed. Having read \"The Rivers\", and \"The Hands of A Stranger\", I had full confidence in choosing this book with no other needed information other than the name: \"MICHAEL FARRIS SMITH!

But that serenity was just as often shattered and shattered into the darkest corners of the countryside as he was overpowered by the thoughts of the things that he hated--The wife that had been and the boy he couldn't see and the wife he had now and then men who tasted her and the dead who were gone and the living who would return.\"Thank You HACHETTE Book Group, and Michael Farris Smith.

He did it again - and it is fantastic. These characters are shades of people you and I know - those who have made awful mistakes in their past but are trying now to pull themselves out of the sucking mud of failure. As in Michael Farris Smith's outstanding debut Rivers set on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, the moist, jungly atmosphere of the deep south again wraps around the reader like vines of kudzu, but it is the conjuring of characters that is his gift.In the little town of McComb, halfway between New Orleans and Jackson, two locals have come home. They do not know one another, although their paths have crossed before, and each has been gone a long time. Maben is a young mother fallen on hard times. She has some ugly memories and plenty of regret, but getting herself and her little girl to a women's shelter seems like the first step in the right direction. In desperation, however, that step falters, and she ends up holding the service revolver of a dead sheriff's deputy.Russell steps off the bus that has delivered him from an 11 year stint in prison. Driving drunk, he once killed a young man and although his debt to society is paid, the brothers of the dead boy want more. They are intent on a collision course with Russell, but his road swerves, and it is Maben's life that he intersects.While any author strives to paint the primary residents of his novel with depth and nuance, Smith leaves no character single-sided. Whether it is frighteningly effeminate thugs in an overnight jail cell, a sour old couple too stingy to sell a few slices of loaf bread from their campsite, or Consuela who speaks barely a word of English, the reader is able to see and hear and smell these characters. It is as if you are dozing alongside Maben when the stout lady-trucker in a Waylon Jennings t-shirt offers help. She appears for maybe two sentences, but she is totally real. Every peripheral player in the story is that way and more. Russell's father and best friend from high school are good men you want to wrap your arms around with love, and yet, the way that Smith portrays the prime antagonist is gorgeously brutal. And touching.I'm not sure what it says about me that the single time I got choked up reading this story is when the bad guy Larry, the taller and more unstable of the two angry brothers, has a break-down. As he begins to cry, then sobs, I knew he was intent on probably beating Russell to death, and yet I became emotional. I shed tears for this broken, desperate, and horrible man. That is what Smith does. He opens up the humanity of every person to walk through his stories.His writing style occasionally reminds me a little bit of Faulkner with spatterings of long and lyrical sentences - but he is as plain spoken as Hemingway, too. Smith does not tell you what is deep down below the surface inside his characters. He shows you simply and plainly a memory or thought, and it is up to the reader to consider who the character is at heart. While it might seem impossible for these two styles to inhabit the same book, consider the following scenario.A terrified and distraught Maben reminisces about the single solid patch in her life where she and the baby were safe. She remembers... \"walking with Annalee, back and forth to work or to the Dollar General or to the grocery store or wherever they needed to go, the spring turning into summer and their walks together maybe out of necessity but always welcome to Maben as she wanted to wrap up the sun and the warmth and the child and the days together and put them somewhere safe so that one day she could get them back out and look at them and remember.\"While I have no personal connection to the author other than book club author events, I can attest to the honesty and accuracy of his settings. We have extended family members not just on the Mississippi Gulf Coast where Rivers takes place, but also in McComb where Russell and Maben's lives collide. The phrasing and pace of the language, his description and feel for the out-of-doors here are spot on. There is nothing worse than a southern novel written by an outsider who tries too hard - Smith is the real deal.You know that really old song by Dusty Springfield called \"Son of a Preacher Man?\" If you've ever read any interviews with Smith, you'll know his daddy was a Baptist preacher. The thing about Mississippi and church is that it doesn't always necessarily add up to faith, per se. I live here in the Bible Belt - about 5o miles from where Desperation Road is set - and can tell you that the old morality stories and teachings about judgement go past dogma. Smith inserts into his books some of the philosophical meanderings that often come when a good preacher takes the pulpit.If we are all forgiven, then what separates us from the worst offenders ever to have lived? If we are washed equally clean upon penitent request, then what Russell - just out of prison - witnessed there means nothing. Is a now-penitent child rapist equally as clean in the eyes of God as a man who got drunk and accidentally killed someone? Maybe faith saves our souls, but how about our sanity?Smith writes: \"..thought about what the preacher said. 'It's there if you want it. Don't matter what you've done.' There was something odd about that. Seems like there had to be a point of no return. Things you couldn't take back. He had seen the worst of men and he wanted there to be punishment for that so that he could feel like he was different from them.\" Come to McComb to visit my family, and like Russell's dad, we'll fry you up a golden stack of catfish and crack open a cold beer. Russell and Maben truly lived this story, and if you'll open its pages, so will you. Dark and utterly beautiful.

We aren't told of his crime in the early stages of the story, but rather the 24 hours that follow his release. From being beaten as soon as he walked off the bus, to getting drunk and getting laid and redoing it a few times over for a few days until a woman enters into his life with her child. She is on her own plight having suffered from violence herself.Smith takes us on a desperate journey and one that comes full circle. The alcoholism and violence that is often followed by bad decisions and moments of regret that last a lifetime. But sometimes in those decisions, comes an opportunity at redemption. This was a gritty one - all the charm of a hillbilly noir. Character development; plot driven, awesome descriptions. Well done, Williams. Even James Lee Burke gave you a satisfying applause in a review- that is top notch.

Unfortunately for Russell, not everyone else agrees, and even before he can step off the bus, he sees two brothers waiting for him. The two attack him viciously before being interrupted by a citizen who threatens to call the police. The brothers leave Russell injured on the ground, promising that this won't be the last he'll see of them.At virtually the same time, a woman named Maben, who has been used very hard by life, is trudging down the highway toward McComb, encouraging her young daughter to keep up, and struggling to carry the heavy garbage bag that contains all their worldly possessions. At this point, the reader has no idea why Russell was in prison, why the two brothers are so intent on doing him harm, or why Maben and her child are out on the road. But it's clear that they are both damaged souls and that their long-term survival is very much in doubt.Maben's circumstances are about to get much worse in a very big hurry. She settles her daughter into a shabby truck stop motel and then, down to her last few dollars, she attempts to make a few more by resorting to a practice that many desperate women before her have adopted. The attempt has catastrophic results both for Maben and for her daughter.Meanwhile, Russell has settled into a small house and reconnected with his father and his father's new female companion. He will attempt to make a living as a handyman, but is constantly looking over his shoulder for the trouble that is never very far behind. Inevitably, of course, his own life will intersect with Maben's and the combined weight of their problems may well sink them both.This is a beautifully written book that captures the setting and these characters as sharply as a finely honed blade. It's impossible not to sympathize with Russell and with Maben as they struggle to achieve some level of peace at a time when the odds are so heavily stacked against them, and even the minor characters are very vividly drawn. This is not a book that's going to make you smile very often (it is, after all, titled Desperation Road), but these are characters and this is a setting that will remain with the reader for a very long time."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13427823-maureen", "userReview": "You are never stronger...than when you land on the other side of despair.\u201d \u2015 Zadie Smith, White Teeth. Russell Gaines is back home after spending 11 years in Parchman Penitentiary, and he believes he's paid his debt to society - he just wants to get on with his life. Others don't agree with him. Revenge has a long memory, and for those who live with it, it's an all consuming beast that has to be acknowledged. The small Southern town of McComb, Mississippi, with its explosive mix of bourbon, guns and drugs, mean it's a particularly dangerous place for revenge to make it's home.Meanwhile, Maben and her young daughter Annalee are walking the interstate, they're desperate and tired like only the homeless can experience. Maben decides to give her daughter a break and spends her last few dollars on a motel room. This night though will end in disaster, with Maben in possession of a pistol, and a deputy dead at her feet.In the funny way that fate works, Russell and Maben's paths cross in a most spectacular fashion. Both of them have a past they're desperate to leave behind, but with the odds stacked against them, the future's not looking too good.Where do I begin with this one. It's not really a thriller, and neither is there a mystery to be solved. Apart from the first few chapters, it's not a fast paced, action packed storyline either, so why then did it grab me and not let go till the very end? Well for one thing the narrative was quite simply beautiful. The author writes with a clarity that damn near touched my soul, recognising (as he does so eloquently) human frailty and emotion in its many forms. It was very much character led, and the characters, though flawed/ damaged were superbly portrayed. Michael Farris Smith is a master wordsmith, and had me hanging on to every one of those words. I didn't want it to end, but I couldn't read it fast enough!

Wow it is so good!Two hard-luck cases collide in this smooth-flowing novel of the Deep South, where a Mississippi town harbors a long-brewing hunger for vengeance and a slim chance of redemption.Maben and Russell are heading to McComb from different directions, geographically and otherwise. She has been on the road for too many years after a terrible car accident and has tried almost everything to make a life somewhere for herself and her young daughter. Russell has been serving 11 years in prison for a drunken driving incident that killed a young man. But fate takes Maben on yet another nasty detour via a deputy sheriff who rapes her and then calls up two friends to join the party. Maben grabs his gun and ends that soiree before it gets going.

At the onset of this novel, Russell and Maben are strangers on a collision course. Their characters are flawed, yet human. You want to know every ounce of their pain even though reading each word reverberates throughout your soul. Russell Gaines is now a free man living in McComb, Mississippi. He was incarcerated for 11 years. Though technically he paid for his crimes, not everyone thinks so (himself included) \u2013 and those who harbor ill will, take it out on him as often as possible. He does however, still have a few people in his corner, his dad: Mitchell, and his friend Boyd.Maben and her young daughter Annabel haven\u2019t had a home in forever. In fact, they don\u2019t have anything. A trash bag full of clothes and the shoes on their feet. Walking along the highway for days with an exhausted girl by her side, and no more than a few dollars, Maben know she has to stop. Staying at a hotel for the night, Maben sneaks out and finds herself in big trouble and both she and Annabel have to flee, right quick. Mad with fright, Maben crosses paths with Russell, changing their destinies forever. Russell recognizes the look in Maben\u2019s eyes. He knows he should run, should choose differently -as his coming to her aide, could have negative ramifications for him. Yet Russell, who many see as a danger and a threat (because he screwed up and has made a lifetime of mistakes), is a man who has a heart. A man who cares. A man whose past does not define him.  Though Maben has never had anyone to trust, in Russell she senses something. A kindness, a kindred spirit. And so, they defy common sense and each helps the other, no matter the cost. Michael Farris Smith does something quite exquisite here.  He wrote a complex novel about characters whose lives are anything but pretty, yet he did so beautifully with words that finesse the reader. Words that evoke emotion from the start and make you feel as though you are there. Based on the storyline, this novel could have taken on a completely bleak and depressing tone, yet in an amazing feat, Michael Farris Smith managed to avoid that, which I am still amazed at. Though this isn\u2019t the happiest of reads and many might find it sad, I can honestly say that this is masterful read. Its beauty has left an indelible mark on my heart. \u201cDesperation Road\u201d is the story of life; addiction; consequences; frailty of the human spirit; friendship; love; and redemption. Above all, it is a story not to be missed.

This is a dark tangled story about flawed people in nasty circumstances showing strength, bad judgment, resilience, more bad judgment, and small and not so small acts of kindness. I can\u2019t say much about the plot, because it comes together in a way that you should experience as it unfolds. At most, I will say that it takes place in Mississippi \u2013 so it fits into what I think of southern noir literature -- that it features homeless single mother Maben on the run with her five year old daughter and recently released from prison Russell. At first, it\u2019s not clear why Farris Smith tells their parallel stories, but quickly their lives become tangled in more ways than one. There is something mesmerizing about Farris Smith\u2019s writing. He takes us into the heads of a few characters, drawing us into the cadence of their thoughts, emotions and impulses. This is not a thriller or a mystery, but often I felt like reading with just one eye open because I sensed that nothing good was coming -- characters in a bad way trying to keep their heads above water, but often using the most abysmal strategies. But it\u2019s not all bad, so there\u2019s room to catch your breath. I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t add that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever read a novel that featured so much unabashed drunk driving. Yikes! Regardless, this one is highly recommended to anyone who doesn\u2019t shy away from dark non-linear stories. For me, this was a great introduction to a new writer.

Stories of troubled people whose destiny seems set from page one: there will be trouble, it\u2019s just a case of where and when. This is such a tale. Russell has just been released from Parchman Penitentiary where he\u2019s served eleven years for vehicular homicide. He\u2019d been enjoying a late night drive around the back roads, close to his home town in McComb, Mississippi. He\u2019d had a drink too. And when his vehicle crashed into a parked truck a boy was killed. But his time has been served and now Russell is going home to see if it\u2019s possible to pick his life back up again.At the same time, another previous resident of McComb is also making her way back to the town, with her young daughter Annalee. Maben doesn\u2019t intent to stay long but there\u2019s a homeless shelter there - at least there used to be \u2013 and she needs somewhere for to hold up for a day or two. Will the two paths cross? Almost inevitably.I loved the way the characters were fleshed out. I really warmed to Maben, a troubled girl who\u2019s made some wrong choices and suffered from bad luck too. She wants to take care of her daughter \u2013 no, she needs to take care of her daughter, it\u2019s the only thing that makes the struggle to pull through worthwhile. Her story is heart wrenching but she\u2019s tough, a survivor. Russell has always been a touch reckless. He\u2019s been scarred by the knocks life has dealt him but at least he\u2019s happy to be free again. He means well but he\u2019s really got no plan, no direction. He\u2019ll drift along for a while and see which threads he\u2019s able to pick up from his past life. This book just sizzles with atmosphere and tension. The problems just keep piling up and it\u2019s never clear how it\u2019s all going to play out. There were times whilst I was reading this that I caught myself whispering \u2018no don\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2019, I was so caught up in it.

When the chance for redemption comes along, he grapples with doing the right thing. But what is right for Russell is potentially harmful to others.
