Those who aren't enslaved are taxed into poverty. The dragons rule forged a man into a dragon killing weapon. Dragons took away his family so he takes away their lives. His name is Bitterwood. Unfortunately it seems the feared Bitterwood has killed the wrong dragon. After killing the prince, the king decides humanity must be wiped out once and for all.Bitterwood is truly not at all what I expected it to be. The dragons aren't truly the massive fire breathing monsters I envisioned. They aren't much bigger than men. They also live in castles, keep slaves, read books, collect taxes, and do many things ancient rulers were known to do. The most surprising thing is it gets weirder. The story itself is actually largely science fiction.Some aspects of Bitterwood are just what I envisioned namely Bitterwood himself. After losing his family to dragons, Bitterwood turned into a medieval Punisher basically deciding the only good dragon is a dead one. He kills all the dragons he can and allows his hate to fuel and guide him.While Bitterwood is the tile character most of the story is told through the eyes of others. The varied points of view were overall appreciated, particularly Zanzeroth. Zanzeroth is an advisor to the king, but is largely known as a deadly Hunter who is still somewhat feral. He stalks Bitterwood throughout the tale and is incredibly dangerous.Bitterwood was a largely enjoyable story with little resemblance to what I initially imagined."}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/921624-greg", "userReview": "[cyborg (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Loren", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/797200-loren", "userReview": "From ISawLightningFall.comNew-weird writer China Mieville has gained fame not only for his surreal stories, but for calling the inimitable J.R.R. Tolkien \"the wen on the arse of fantasy literature.\" Not exactly a charitable statement. But while most of Mieville's attacks could be attributed to differences in personal preference or philosophical conviction -- one could answer condemnations of John Ronald Reuel's \"cod-Wagnerian pomposity, his boys-own-adventure glorying in war, his small-minded and reactionary love for hierarchical status-quos\" at length -- this point hits home: Tolkien's tropes \"have spread like viruses.\" Of course, this wouldn't be a problem if everyone who populated his works with elves and dwarves shared the Oxford linguist's world-building skills. But few do, and unfortunately they get lumped in with the scribblers, ignored simply for writing high fantasy. Take James Maxey's Bitterwood, for instance. I bet many think the novel treads well-worn ground simply because it features dragons and archers, wizards and axe-wielding warriors. But that would be a mistake, because Maxey is interested in upending all the stereotypes.Mankind has been enslaved, but not by your garden variety tyrant. For as long as anyone can remember, humanity has been ruled by dragons, cruel and intelligent creatures that control the earth and skies. But in past decades, the hand of dragon king Albekizan has become particularly heavy upon the land, levying harsh taxes on wheat and wealth and human life itself. One night when Albekizan's two sons, Bodiel and Shandrazel, are hunting human slaves as part of their rite of succession, arrows flash from the darkness and Bodiel falls -- dead. All signs point to The Ghost Who Kills, The Death of All Dragons, the mythic Bitterwood. Albekizan burns with vengeance, but how can he kill a myth? A plan begins to emerge, one far more satisfying than the execution of a single individual. Albekizan won't bother hunting for one man. He's going to eradicate the whole human race.One of the things Bitterwood does particularly well is weave a tangled skein of conflicting motivations among its ensemble of characters, looping them every which way before jerking them taut in explosively violent confrontations. Also, the plot twists genuinely satisfy, particularly if you happen to be a fan of John Christopher. That's not to say there aren't a few missteps. Several times exposition occurs through the introduction of minor, extremely short-lived characters, and a ranting, fanatical preacher who EXPOUNDETH UPON THE KING JAMES BIBLE IN ALL CAPS annoys. (Note to authors near and far: Please retire this hoary archetype with extreme prejudice.) Still, it's impressive that Maxey manages to wring an unexpected revelation even out of that character. Bitterwood's a consistently surprising and entertaining read."}, {"userName": "Jason Garman", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5733814-jason-garman", "userReview": "What It\u2019s AboutIn the distant future, a race of intelligent dragons dominates the Earth. They have subjugated humanity as slaves and pets, disdaining them as inferior beings. Bant Bitterwood is one of those subjugated humans, but when dragons kill his family and burn his hometown, he dedicates the rest of his life to killing as many dragons as he can. He kills so many that he becomes a folk hero to the humans and a terrifying legend among the dragons. When Bitterwood kills the dragon king\u2019s favorite son, the king vows to kill every human alive in revenge.Why I Like ItThe thing I like most about Bitterwood is the constantly-shifting conflict. Maxey introduces a fairly large cast of characters with very different, but often overlapping, goals. Two characters that are working together at the beginning of a scene may find themselves in deadly opposition by the end after something unexpected happens. This multifaceted conflict really pays off in the climax of the book, which feels both totally crazy (in an \u201cI can\u2019t believe that just happened!\u201d kind of way) and totally inevitable at the same time. The setup takes a while, but the headlong rush of the climax is definitely worth it.Bitterwood is a good example of what I think of as a Science Fantasy. The story has a very fantasy-like feel to it, but underneath all the \u201cmagic\u201d is a plausible science fiction explanation. The science fiction aspects are pretty light, more suggested than explicit, but it makes it feel more unique and less like \u201cjust another dragon story\u201d. And let\u2019s face it, if you\u2019re writing a story about dragons at this point in the fantasy genre, you really need something different to make it stand out. Bitterwood does.What I Don\u2019t LikeAt first I wasn\u2019t all that interested in the dragon\u2019s viewpoint chapters, since I was expecting the story to focus on the oppressed humans and their struggle for survival. But as the story went on its scope became larger than that, and I started getting more interested in the dragons\u2019 viewpoints. I was also initially bothered by how human the dragons seem, but later in the story there are some hints about the dragons\u2019 origins that explain why that might be.The Bottom LineBitterwood is a great multi-layered adventure story. The characters are diverse and interesting, and their often-conflicting goals lead to a constantly changing conflict that is a lot of fun to watch unfold. The climax of this conflict is one of the best I\u2019ve read, with the characters clashing in unexpected ways that somehow seem inevitable once they have happened."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2718093-jennifer", "userReview": "Bitterwood was a fun surprise. In my endless quest to find more books to read at night (when my husband is at work), in my parked car (waiting for my oldest to get out of school) and of course the endless waiting in the accurately named waiting rooms; I sometimes take a leap of faith and try new stuff from lists. This book came from a list of authors who attended Orson Scott Card's Literary Boot Camp. http://www.hatrack.com/I didn't realize that Bitterwood was about dragons until I went to order it from my library. I almost didn't get it on the pure principle that dragon books have been done and frankly if you read books about them you've crossed a line and lumped yourself with people who have conversations like this: \"Well, that only applies if you have the staff of summoning and you're a 12th level wizard UNLESS you have the blue stone of ultimate blueness and the left shoe of divining..\"Yeah, not my bag. So I picked it up anyway and started in. I'm glad I did. These dragons don't let you make wishes or become the best giant fire-breathing pet you've ever had. These guys have elegant high teas at which they eat baskets full of white kittens. They keep precise records on everything they own and that's pretty much everything. If your village doesn't pay it's taxes; well I would ditch the diet and really enjoy your last hours on Earth. Normally I hate it when books have multiple POV characters, but James Maxey pulls it off. I cared about the cast and I want to read the next book to see how they survive. I don't think I can give a better recommendation than that."}, {"userName": "Lana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10104673-lana", "userReview": "A great read where dragons rule the world in a reversal of fortune, seems humans had created them for fun, to hunt them down as prey, then they gave them intelligence so they would make the hunt more challenging but these took over and now humans were the slaves and remebered nothing of the time when they were in fact rulers and intelligent!! however some dragons had sympathy for some humans they formed bonds with, like jandra and pet. whilst bitterwood (bant) was an avowed dragonslayer and when they all meet one another tragedy strikes. the dragon kings favourite son is killed by bitterwood whose family has all been wiped out by the dragons but the king has another son, one who is not in favour of war and is an intellectual rather than a warrior and when the king dies he in turn becomes king and proposes a truce with human leaders and a new form of governance!! will this succeed when humans are still fighting one another on the bases of religious belief??? are humans as well developed as dragons in this aspect or will they still mire themselves in superstitious belief following one prophet after another?"}, {"userName": "Kristy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3795348-kristy", "userReview": "This book sounded like it was going to be a Robin Hood style dragon-slayer story, and I thought \"Oh, cool!\" Unfortunately, it was just plain weird. While our main character, Bant Bitterwood, does indeed have a bow and arrows with which he slays dragons, any interest factor stops there. The rest is pointless. The dragons themselves seem more like dinosaurs, or just really large iguannas. There's this \"prophet\" (more to be said on that, but it would definitely be a spoiler) who spouts out scripture but refuses to help people if it doesn't co-incide with his mission. At first I wasn't really sure if he was meant to be a slur against Christianity or not, since it did destroy the faith of Bant Bitterwood himself. But near the end Bant has a scene where there's sort of a renewal of his faith, so I guess that wasn't the intention. Still, the book is blah. I couldn't wait for it to end.

Auch James Maxey hat sich daran versucht: \u00bbBitterholz\u00ab ist der Auftakt der \u00bbHerrschaft der Drachen\u00ab-Reihe, die die Geschichte des Drachent\u00f6ters Bitterholz erz\u00e4hlt.Schon vor langer Zeit haben sich die Drachen als Herrscher \u00fcber die Menschen aufgeschwungen und haben sie versklavt, um f\u00fcr ihre Tyrannen zu arbeiten. Doch nicht jeder hat den Kampf aufgegeben. Bitterholz ist ein legend\u00e4rer Drachent\u00f6ter, doch als er den Sohn des K\u00f6nigs t\u00f6tet, schw\u00f6rt dieser bittere Rache. Sein Plan: Alle Menschen zu vernichten. Ein blutiges Massaker droht.Zugegeben, es wirkt schon etwas befremdlich, wenn Drachen von Nanobots reden und in Darwins Evolutionslehren lesen, um das Geheimnis des Lebens zu entdecken. Aber irgendwie ist gerade das cool. Wie schon der Klappentext des Buches verr\u00e4t, spielt der Roman in einer fernen Zukunft. Lange ist nicht genau klar, woran sich das festmachen l\u00e4sst, doch gegen Ende, ohne zu spoilern, werden viele scheinbar magische Dinge auf technische Weise gekl\u00e4rt, so auch die Herkunft der Drachen selbst. Das war in der Tat einer der gr\u00f6\u00dften Reize des Buches.Leider verblasst er beinahe gegen\u00fcber den M\u00e4ngeln. Deren gr\u00f6\u00dfer ist definitiv, dass der Leser es schwer hat, einen Draht zu den Charakteren aufzubauen. Bis zum Schluss waren Bitterholz\u2018 Motive nicht in allen Punkten klar. Was machte ihn zum Beispiel zu so einem erbitterten Drachent\u00f6ter? Warum hat er mehr Hass auf sie als der Rest der Menschheit?Auch die Dialoge wirkten h\u00e4ufig steif und gek\u00fcnstelt und nicht immer wie wirkliche Gespr\u00e4che. Mit der Dramatik hat es auch nicht immer ganz geklappt und sie wirkte h\u00e4ufig aufgesetzt und \u00fcberspitzt. Da sieht der Drachenk\u00f6nig seinen von Bitterholz erlegten Sohn und schreit voller Schmerz und Hass Bitterholz\u2018 Namen in den Nachthimmel, um danach bittere Rache zu schw\u00f6ren. Das hat eher was von einem schlechten Film, als wirklicher Dramatik.Ob das Buch eine Empfehlung ist? Schwer zu sagen. Mir gefiel vor allem gegen Ende der Science Fiction Teil, aber davor hat mich das Buch streckenweise sehr gelangweilt und es fehlte nicht viel und ich h\u00e4tte es abgebrochen. Ich konnte einfach keinen Draht zu den Figuren finden und die Handlung pl\u00e4tscherte einfach so an mir vorbei.

So I have no idea how well this guy did sticking to or breaking from conventions within the genre. All I know is that it was a mesmerizing story. Taking place on Earth in the far future, dragons have become the dominant lifeform on the planet and have all but enslaved the human race. One man, Bant Bitterwood has made it his life's mission to kill as many dragons as possible. But after he kills the king's son, an order is put out to exterminate all humans on earth.This high concept set up is the backdrop for some really fascinating characters, mostly dragons, each of whom has their own mission, their own goals, their own arcs. Sides are chosen, battles are fought, and the theme of religion and man's attitude toward it are explored in a truly unique way. One of the most poignant scenes comes during a horrific battle where the dragons have been set loose on the humans in one city. Rather than joining forces against the common enemy, the two rival sects go after EACH OTHER for not following the \"one true way.\" Only two disappointments for me in this book, one major, one minor. The major one is that the character of Bitterwood, for whom the story is named, is really kind of a blah hero. I had heard that this book was a Robin Hood allegory. But in Robin Hood, the title character is the one who leads the people against their oppressor. In Bitterwood, the title character is almost tangential to the story. But perhaps that was the author's point all the way. My minor gripe is that one of the dragons, Gadreel, is established early in the story as having a mission to prove that he's better than the slave he's been made to be. But then they never come back to him. Perhaps he's in the sequel.Still, as far as high fantasy goes, this one was quite good. It's got good action, great characters, points to ponder and, I thought, a unique take on traditional \"magic.\" I'd recommend it even if fantasy isn't necessarily your thing."}, {"userName": "James Marsh", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/661762-james-marsh", "userReview": "Would you consider the audio edition of Bitterwood to be better than the print version?I have enjoyed both the print and audio versions of Bitterwood. I would gladly experience either, but audio books are so convenient and bring the action to life.What other book might you compare Bitterwood to and why?I got back into epic fantasy with James Maxey's Bitterwood, Storm Front by Jim Butcher and Elantris by Brandon Sanderson. I enjoyed each of them, but just comparing each volume on it's own bitterwood was my favorite.What does Dave Thompson bring to the story that you wouldn't experience if you just read the book?Dave Thompson did a wonderful job of bringing to life a variety of characters and making each sound unique. He did a wonderful job as an aged dragon scientist and as a scared 9 year old girl. He kept each voice unique and filled each line with the appropriate pathos and emotion. He even did a few animal sounds, singing and sound effects. I hope he does the rest of the trilogy.Did you have an extreme reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry?This book is epic. It has elements from fantasy and science fiction. It is in different turns humorous, action packed, dramatic and the surprises keep on coming. It keeps you guessing right to the end.Any additional comments?I received this audio book as a free review copy, but I had read and loved the book beforehand.

This second of the Bitterwood trilogy picks up where the first left off, and takes on a non-stop ride. The main characters from Bitterwood continue their stories, well, some of them, and we are introduced to new and compelling characters. Some of them could go on to spin off their own trilogies - how about it James? The blending of dragons as equals (or are they superior to humans, hmmm?), and earth as an alien world, and technology is reminiscent of Anne McCaffrey's novels of Pern though James Maxey's are more grown up, and there is not always a purely happy, nice, neat ending. I like that messy ending thing - it's closer to real life. I also was left wondering about James' true feelings on life, the universe, religion and everything. No, the answer is not 42. However, my suppositions about Maxey's answer to this question have ranged from he's devout to the biggest cynic of anyone I've met (except my own child), and back to somewhere in between. Who knows. I do know one thing though, I guess Mars Hill College gets some credit for his intimate knowledge of scripture, and I think I see some of the discussions with Dr. Jinx and Lieneger (I never could spell his name) woven into the fabric of the tales.Exceedeingly enjoyable summer reading.

Blog reviews often contain links which are not reproduced here, nor will updates or modifications to the blog review be replicated here. Graphic and children's reviews on the blog typically feature two or three images from the book's interior, which are not reproduced here.Note that I don't really do stars. To me a book is either worth reading or it isn't. I can't rate it three-fifths worth reading! The only reason I've relented and started putting stars up there is to credit the good ones, which were being unfairly uncredited. So, all you'll ever see from me is a five-star or a one-star (since no stars isn't a rating, unfortunately).I rated this book WARTY!WARNING! MAY CONTAIN UNHIDDEN SPOILERS! PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!Well this book is different! I'm not a big fan of dragon stories, but once in a while one comes along and entertains me. Neither am I a fan of series. Call me npc, but I prefer the new rather than the recycled old, so it was interesting to read a story about dragons that had a new approach. The problem was that this novel became really boring about two-thirds the way through, and I lost all interest in it.There's a prologue in this novel which I skipped as I always do. I've never regretted not reading a prologue and if the author doesn't feel it\u2019s important enough to go into chapter one (or beyond), I surely don\u2019t feel it important enough to waste time in reading. That said, the opening chapter was a grabber. A hunter is sitting by his forest camp fire eating dragon tongue. The dead dragon is lodged in a tree above his head, brought down by his expertly placed arrow, but this dragon has a backpack\u2026 Okay, it\u2019s satchel, but wouldn\u2019t a backpack have been way cool? However, this is one of those traditional fantasies, where backpacks don\u2019t exist, so satchel it is.The satchel shows that this dragon is a sentient being - a scholar, even. The man burns the notebook the dragon had been keeping. He is old and gray, and is headed for a dragon ceremony which the hunter is evidently seeking to disrupt, a sun-dragon ceremony at which the first human to ever witness such an event and live to tell of it, is awaiting its start with anticipation.Despite being human, Jandra has been raised since childhood by the dragons and fully empathizes with them if not all of them with her. Actually, it was one dragon, Vendevorex, a sky dragon (like the one in the tree), and the king's personal wizard, who raised her. Why dragons would have such institutions as the monarchy is not explained, and I found it most peculiar.I'm not a fan of monarchies and privilege of birth, but I realize that they are part and parcel of this kind of fantasy. It would be nice, though, once in a while, to see writers step off the path most traveled and carve out some new routes; however, this author certainly takes a half-step, because story is rife with interesting perspectives on dragon-lore, and he doesn\u2019t leave it solely at that.This story could, in some ways, be described as modeling itself after Planet of the Apes, since there are three types of dragon. The sun dragons, like the chimpanzees, are the nobility. Their guards and soldiers are the earth dragons who fulfill the role of the gorillas. Finally there are the urang-utans, which are the sky-dragons, who are scholars and scientists.The sun dragon ceremony, which was rudely interrupted, is how a new king is chosen. The king's first-born male offspring is banished from the dragon's presence, and forced to live by their own means until they reach a point where they feel they can challenge the king. If one of them can do so successfully, he becomes the new king. In this case, there are two contenders, but one of them - the more scholarly one - rejects the barbaric hunt of enslaved humans - a frivolous ceremony which precedes the main event. His brother goes after the human as tradition demands - and is slaughtered in the forest from a brutal rain of well-aimed arrows, all from the bow of the lone hunter. \"Bitterwood\" cries the king, and lets loose the dogs of war. But Bitterwood escapes by means of a sewer cover which lies in the middle of the highway!Yes, if that grabbed you as it did me, you'll want to know more, but I'm not going to tell you because the rest of the novel conveniently pretends that never happened! I guess you have to go to volume two or three to find out, and I'm not playing that game! I will tell you that one thing I found really odd in Bitterwood was the prologues. I don\u2019t do prologues. I routinely skip them and I never miss them. That ought to tell you plenty.In this case, I skipped the one at the start, but when we reached part two of the book, there was another prologue! I'm like, \"Wait, wasn't part one the prologue to part two? I don\u2019t get this authorial OCD with prologues! If it\u2019s important, then put it into chapter one or later! If you don\u2019t consider it material that's worth including in the body of the novel, I don\u2019t consider it\u2019s material that's worth reading.This turned out to be great - an original novel looking at the world from the dragon PoV where humans are mere subjects, and I was enjoying it until Jandra quit being a pet of Vendevorex's and became a pet of Petar (Peta?!) Gondwell, who promptly man-handled her and treated her very much like property - and not once did she object or even have qualms about it. So much for a strong female character!At one point, being brave when others would run, Jandra gets her throat slit. Not her jugular, but her trachea, and there's a lot of blood. When Vendevorex tells her he's going to magically close the wound, she nods her head. WHAT? Her throat is slit deeply and she's nodding her head? I think this is a case of a writer not paying close attention to what it is they're writing!Oh, and it's \"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life\" - not \"Origins of Species\" as it's rendered on page 207! But by that point I was skimming pages because the story got lost and was not in the least bit interesting to me. I can't recommend this and will not be following this series."}, {"userName": "Cosmin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43986966-cosmin", "userReview": "These are not the dragons you are looking for...Blame Tolkien for it, but I thought dragons differently.

I was getting confused with all the names. Anyone who could write this, in my opinion, has to be a genius. Not too happy with the wizard dying but glad he and Jandra each let the other know their true feelings. As for Pet, guess he matured a lot. Amazing book."}, {"userName": "Garrett", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/802571-garrett", "userReview": "I was going to wait to write this review until I finished the second book in the series, but the list of to-reads is piling up and James' next book is slipping down in the pile (not because I don't want to read it but because of gifts I've received lately that I feel obligated to read so those people know how awesome they are for getting a book for me (thanks JoDee and Judy) - it's always important to keep family happy.Anyway, I do want to review this GREAT book. It was a fun read, and a quick one. I've heard that it is possible to read this or the next book out of order or not at all because they do a great job of standing on their own. This is a good thing in my eyes. One problem with this book: it was hard to get hold of a copy. I ended up ordering a used copy through Borders. I probably could have tried Amazon, but I like being in a bookstore and smelling that cool new book smell.Setting: This story is also set in a world where aliens have taken over the planet from the humans (by saying also, I mean that the Darkness of the Light book that I just finished also has this general setting). In this case, it is dragons who have taken over.Characters: There are some truly likable and strong characters in this book. Most of them are kind of supernaturally gifted, so it feels a bit slanted, but they are still prone to weaknesses and faults.Plot: This is pretty straightforward as far as plots go. There are a few subplots running through that tie in with the overall plotline. It is all done in a very tight, controlled manner.Conflict: Man versus Dragon is the main one. Although there is some Dragon versus Dragon stuff going on. Some of the characters have some pretty intriguing internal conflicts happening too.Text: I actually know James (we met and talked and work together at a writing retreat), and I can totally see his voice throughout this. Also, his attitudes toward religion and knowledge come through. This is not bad, but it is evident. However, I will say that James is quite fair to the \"opposing\" side of his world view. He isn't narrow-minded like some of the genre writer's I've read and met."}, {"userName": "Buttons", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34260878-buttons", "userReview": "[I think it's Georgia (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Marcus", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4664602-marcus", "userReview": "Is this a book about a vengeful human fighting dragon tyranny or a rebel dragon wizard & his human prot\u00e9g\u00e9 fighting a mad king? Personally, I feel it\u2019s the latter. Although the story starts out with the titular Bitterwood as a teenager, after the first chapter we see little of him until 1/3 of the way into the book. Bitterwood is just a shadowy figure throughout most of the book. Even after he\u2019s reintroduced, his character sees very little development \u2013 most of the story seems to center on the dragon wizard Vendevorex & his human ward Jandra. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve enjoyed a fantasy novel like I did this one. Some might be tempted to write this off as a rip-off of a certain Charlton Heston movie but the similarities didn\u2019t bother me. That\u2019s not to say that there weren\u2019t problems. The quality of the writing was uneven at times, characters seemed to change their behavior to fit the needs of the story, the flashbacks interspersed into the main story were distracting, certain plot elements seemed extraneous, and some events seemed overly contrived. Even so, I did enjoy the book and plan to read the rest of the series.I do want to point out that the beginning chapter might be turn off a lot of readers \u2013 after perusing some of the negative reviews this does appear to be the case. I\u2019ll admit I almost put this one down after reading it; the author didn\u2019t do a very good job making young Bitterwood a sympathetic character. In fact he almost seemed like a psychopath. I\u2019m thankful I didn\u2019t give up though and I have to give this 4 \u00bd stars."}], "description": "Bitterwood has spent the past twenty years hunting down dragons, one at a time. But he is getting old and the hate that he has carried in his heart since a group of dragon-soldiers killed his family is beginning to fade. When he kills the royal prince dragon, the king decides the only retribution is genocide of the human race. Bitterwood is forced to enter the Free City, the grand trap designed to eradicate mankind, with thousands of others. Can he lead from within, or can a select few dragons unite to stop the king's madness from becoming reality. Full of rich characters and drama, this is an amazingly astute vision of our own culture by way of a feudal kingdom where dragons rule, and humans are used as workers or pets.", "title": "Bitterwood\n      \n          (Dragon Age #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1062113.Bitterwood", "average": 3.57, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1323066920l/1062113.jpg", "reviews": 119, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/225692.James_Maxey", "name": "James Maxey"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Science Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1062113.Bitterwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16036004-bitterholz", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10845639-bitterwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/397756.Nobody_Gets_the_Girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21291846-bitterwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3379316-dragonforge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11511696-greatshadow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6006616-dragonseed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
