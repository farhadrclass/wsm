Thus, while the book might seem to be about the most interesting topic in the history of the world, the author chose to focus more on the less interesting machinations of the French Millers' Union and Health Department. It is like a GODZILLA movie that spends fifteen minutes on the monster attack and two hours on the long, unheralded struggle between a coalition of those whose cars were crushed and their auto insurance companies about the fine points of their policies. Perhaps this topic should be re-explored by a contemporary author with the benefit of fifty more years of scientific knowledge and less of a fixation on legal tedium, as a town driven mad by bread tainted with naturally occurring LSD is the MOST INTERESTING POSSIBLE SUBJECT IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3345848-jill", "userReview": "Really interesting book about the mysterious 'accursed bread' that caused hallucinations, disabilities, suicidal thoughts, and ultimately death in the tiny French village of Pont-Saint-Espirit in August of 1951. Fuller is a journalist who decided to take up the story after seeing a small newspaper article on the mass poisoning. He traveled to France and interviewed some of the victims and read over all of the official reports, medical reports, and court cases. The legal proceedings of the case are as heart-breaking as the story of the actual poisoning itself. Of the blamed causes of the poisoning was mercury-based poison (in the end) and historical ergotism (in the beginning). Fuller delves into the rare historical appearances of ergotism, a mass poison event which suddenly strikes its victims with deep psychological terrors, insomnia that lasts weeks, convulsions, endless chattering, and the overwhelming desire to jump out of windows. As the story goes on, Fuller re-counts the discovery of the drug LSD by two Swiss scientists but which was too new a drug to be taken seriously in 1951 by the French police. As time went on, it seems more and more likely that what caused the mass poisoning was a high dosage of LSD in the flour used in the bread-making in Pont-Saint-Espirit, which appears in nature in rare cases of ergot on rye.Very interesting book, not only for its medical points, but also for its glimpse at the French legal system, and the French government's flour monopoly in the mid-20th century."}, {"userName": "Lin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/931410-lin", "userReview": "I am re-reading this book. This is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. Fuller tells of an event that seems like it is coming from the dark ages, but happened just before I was born in 1951 in France. This is not a very remote event, yet it seems like it is very remote, since it is nearly incomprehensible that an event like this could even happen in modern times.The writing method is nonfiction yet in a riveting manner. I was never bored for one second when I read this book the first time, so I am going to read it again for pleasure (the subject is not pleasurable, but the act of reading about it is.)"}, {"userName": "Heidi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36550016-heidi", "userReview": "I first read this book when I was about 35.I won't go into the storyline because others have done that and I don't want to ruin the suspense for people who have not actually read it yet.Absolutely one of the most fascinating and riveting books I have ever read in my life.The last third of the book where he talks about the French govenment getting involved was not as interesting.Anybody who likes to read at all would be interested in this book.

A La estatua de La Virgen de Notre Dame de la Bache se le hab\u00eda ca\u00eddo el brazo izquierdo casi por completo. El incidente se consider\u00f3 de mal ag\u00fcero y caus\u00f3 temor. El pueblo tiene una larga historia de guerras, saqueos y muertes y acababan de salir de la Segunda Guerra Mundial apenas con vida ya que los bombardeos los alcanzaron en diversas ocasiones. \u00c9sto es lo que sucedi\u00f3...En Julio de 1951 saldr\u00edan de la estaci\u00f3n de Chauvigny, 10 sacos con 100 kilos de harina para ser distruibuida en la regi\u00f3n de Pont-Saint Espirit. La harina llega en las v\u00edsperas de la festividad de Fete du Premier. La empresa Union Meuni\u00e9re se encargar\u00eda de la distribuci\u00f3n de \u00e9sta harina entre los panaderos de la regi\u00f3n. El primer panadero en recibir \u00e9sta harina not\u00f3 un tono gris\u00e1ceo y una textura \u00f3lea y pegajosa, decidi\u00f3 mezclarla con las sobras de su harina para mejorar la consistencia. Las primeras hogazas de pan se vendieron a la ma\u00f1ana siguiente r\u00e1pidamente.Los primeros s\u00edntomas empezaron a manifestarse a las pocas horas de ingerir el pan. Hubo diarrea de aguda a grave, c\u00f3licos viol\u00e9ntos y erupciones cut\u00e1neas e insomnio.La gente comparti\u00f3 el pan con sus mascotas que empezaron a mostrar los primeros s\u00edntomas de envenenamiento pero presentaron otro s\u00edntoma m\u00e1s que fueron las alucinaciones. Corr\u00edan, aullaban, chillaban, gru\u00f1\u00edan y terminaban l\u00e1stimandose de muerte con golpes, comiendo piedras, metales u otros. La gente empeoraba poco despu\u00e9s de la muerte de sus animales. Hipotermia, arritmia, escalofr\u00edos, n\u00e1useas, diarrea, v\u00e9rtigo y las primeras alucionaciones visuales y auditivas comenzaron a surgir. Ojos vidriosos, insomnia, explosiones de energ\u00eda o euforia e histeria en algunos casos.Las alucinaciones pasaron de momentos agradables hasta escenas sacadas del Infierno de Dante. Demonios y bolas de fuego nocturnas, tigres y techos sangrantes hasta deseos suicidas de tirarse desde la ventana o lugares altos con deseos de volar. 48 horas despu\u00e9s, los s\u00edntomas aumentaron, la sudoraci\u00f3n excesiva dejaba un olor rancio a rat\u00f3n muerto u orina a\u00f1eja en las s\u00e1banas de los enfermos. Las primeras v\u00edctimas murieron de falla cardiaca, ya que el ritmo y la presi\u00f3n sangu\u00ednea cambiaba constantemente. La gente lleg\u00f3 hasta las 200 hrs sin poder dormir.El Ergotismo o Cornezuelo del Centeno fue el causante de \u00e9sta epidemia pero se le llam\u00f3 entre la gente como El Mal del Quemado o El Fuego de San Antonio que fue descrito en libros de medicina de la Edad Media. Se cre\u00eda que rezando a San Antonio, la sensaci\u00f3n de fuego en las extremidades y el est\u00f3mago disminu\u00edan. Pueblos enteros cayeron en la m\u00e1s intensa y aterradora locura que llev\u00f3 a la gente al caos en las calles y miles se volvieron psic\u00f3ticos en aqu\u00e9l entonces.En Agosto 24 de 1951 lleg\u00f3 L\u00b4\u00c9closion Brutale y con \u00e9sto sobre vino una histeria masiva ya que todos los enfermos al mismo tiempo comenzaron a alucinar y a gritar constantemente. Cada uno estaba metido en su propia alucinaci\u00f3n, muchos no se dieron cuenta de los gritos del vecino o de lo que alucinaban en la cama de al lado. La histeria masiva surgi\u00f3 en los familiares que no estaba enfermos para poder controlarlos.Los s\u00edntomas del envenenamiento por Ergotismo incluyen: contracciones musculares violentas, sensaci\u00f3n de quemarse en las extremidades, cuerpo tembloroso, contracciones espasm\u00f3dicas, calambres, gangrena, sangrados vaginales severos o abortos en mujeres, acid\u00e9z y reflujo estomacal, irritaci\u00f3n cut\u00e1nea, insomnio, delirios, alucinaciones auditivas y visuales, pensamientos obsesivos y deseos suicidas con histeria.Las investigaciones policiacas los llevaron hasta el Molino Maillet en donde descubrieron que ante la baja producci\u00f3n de trigo y para satisfacer la demanda, se moli\u00f3 junto con los granos buenos, los restos de granos al fondo de los silos. \u00c9stos granos estaban entre humedad, polillas y pelos de ratas entre otros elementos como lo viejo y sucio de los engranes del molino lo que pudo crear \u00e9sta masa venenosa. El ergot prolifera en condiciones de humedad y forma manchas o parches en la cebada. Se detuvieron a dos personas bajo los cargos de fraude alimenticio, transporte inapropiado del grano, infracci\u00f3n especial de legislaci\u00f3n hacia el grano y homicidio involuntario y lesiones.Los laboratorios franceses y suizos investigaron los hechos, en los \u00f3rganos de la gente muerta y sus animales se encontraron restos de ergot y mercurio. Se estaban llevando acabo investigaciones sobre alcaloides. El LSD-25 surgi\u00f3 de experimentos de la semilla de la planta Morning Glory y ten\u00eda s\u00edntomas parecidos al Ergot, lo que se encontr\u00f3 es que el mercurio pudo aumentar la potencia del alcaloide. El Mercurio se usaba en un fungicida llamado Panogen y al a\u00f1adirlo a los sacos en d\u00f3nde se transport\u00f3 el grano, \u00e9ste no se mezcl\u00f3 bien y se peg\u00f3 a las manchas del hongo de ergot incrementando la potencia haci\u00e9ndolo altamente venenoso. Pasaron 10 a\u00f1os del incidente y los sobrevivientes quedaron muy da\u00f1ados del ataque de ergot, algunos incapacitados de por vida y muchos con cuentas enormes en hospitales y pendientes de ser indemnizados.Un libro muy completo e interesante, \u00e9ste hecho sali\u00f3 en el peri\u00f3dico de NY Times y caus\u00f3 gran sorpresa que una enfermedada de la Edad Media surgiera con tal furia en pleno siglo XX. Las drogas alucin\u00f3genas como con todas las drogas terminan liberando una serie de pasiones que no necesariamente queremos que sean liberadas. \u00c9ste fue un episodio de envenenamiento colectivo con consecuencia catrastr\u00f3ficas, lo que indica que hay elementos en \u00e9ste mundo que desconocemos y que hasta un simple pan puede matarnos. Excelente recomendaci\u00f3n de parte de mi hermana."}, {"userName": "Jim Williams", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4576013-jim-williams", "userReview": "Fascinating read."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5879865-mark", "userReview": "Imagine if the Yippies at the '68 Democratic convention in Chicago had succeded in dosing the water supply of the city of Chicago (well, just imagine. The chemical is water soluble but (in water) does not maintain its molecular integrity, so it was a fail to begin with)- and you might end up with a scene like this- a whole town dosed to the gills and acting accordingly, unpredictably. One substance which DOES maintain the molecular integrity of lysergic acid is rye grain (where it orginates, in the ergot fungus)... A whole batch of rye which was ergot-infected made it into and through the mills in a southern French town, and got baked into the daily bread, and that's what happened... A scandal for the Miller's Union, which did a poor inspection job, and a coverup, and the detective work leads experts to - who else? Dr. Hofmann, who identifies the substance correctly.

The flour had become wet, gone moldy and produced the argot lysergic acid which caused the symptoms.

Very interesting, and made me think that perhaps ergot poisoning was responsible for a lot of the \"witchcraft\" incidents throughout history."}], "description": "This is the strange, true, almost incredible story of a small French village where in '51 hundreds of townspeople went mad on a single night. Many of the most highly regarded citizens leaped from windows or jumped into the Rhone, screaming that their heads were made of copper, their bodies wrapped in snakes, their limbs swollen to gigantic size or shrunken to tiny appendages. Others ran through the streets, claiming to be chased by \"bandits with donkey ears\", by tigers, lions & other terrifying apparitions. Animals went berserk. Dogs ripped bark from trees until their teeth fell out. Cats dragged themselves along the floor in grotesque contortions. Ducks strutted like penguins. Villagers & animals died right & left.  Bit by bit, the story behind the tragedy in Pont-St-Esprit--a tiny Provencial village of twisted streets that looks much today as it did in the Middle Ages--unfolded to doctors & toxcologists. That story, one of the most bizarre in modern medical history, is movingly recounted in The Day of St. Anthony's Fire. Throughout the Middle Ages & during other times in history, similar hallucinatory outbreaks occurred. They were called St. Anthony's Fire because it was believed that only prayers to the saint could hold the disease in check.  Even modern medicine could find no way to check the disease. Drugs failed to bring even temporary relief. Hundreds in the village suffered for weeks, with total agonizing insomnia, never knowing when they might once more suddenly go berserk.  The cause of St. Anthony's Fire was known since early history to be ergot, a mold found on rye grain that at rare times inexplicably became posionous enough to create monstrous hallucinations & death. In '51 little significance was attached to the fact that the base of ergot was lysergic acid, also the base for LSD, a drug just coming to the attention of scientists at the time--a drug so powerful that one eye-dropperful could cause as many as 5000 people to hallucinate for hours. At this point, the story becomes a vividly absorbing medical detective story demonstrating the possibility that a strange, spontaneous form of LSD might have caused the human tragedy that came to the hapless villagers of Pont-St-Esprit.", "title": "The Day of St. Anthony's Fire", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3058370-the-day-of-st-anthony-s-fire", "average": 4.17, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435257919l/3058370.jpg", "reviews": 17, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4740839.John_Grant_Fuller_Jr_", "name": "John Grant Fuller Jr."}], "type": ["History", "Nonfiction", "Medical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3058370-the-day-of-st-anthony-s-fire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4861240-the-day-of-st-anthony-s-fire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7929887-the-day-of-st-anthony-s-fire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1542032.The_Ghost_of_Flight_401", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1542037.The_Interrupted_Journey_Two_Lost_Hours_Aboard_A_Flying_Saucer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1448618.Fever_The_Hunt_for_a_New_Killer_Virus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1006351.We_Almost_Lost_Detroit", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1217481.The_Day_We_Bombed_Utah"]}
