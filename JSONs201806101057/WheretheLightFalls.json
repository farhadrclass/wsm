While I was interested in the historical aspects of this book, my choice to read it was mostly based on the descriptions of the characters in the book blurb which appealed to me, as well as the desire to just read something different. It was through some fascinating characters, some fictional, some real people and some based on real people that the events of the times and the spirit of the times were brought to life for me . It did though take me a while to get into the story, but once I did I was captivated by the lives of the four main protagonists even though we do meet the likes of Robespierre and Napoleon. Jean-Luc St. Clair, an young attorney, dedicated to the new government and the ideals of freedom and equality takes a job in Paris. His wife Marie, one of my favorite characters is strong and full of loyalty to the causes of freedom as well. Andre de Valiere, a nobleman stripped of his \"de\" which classifies him as of that class is a soldier also dedicated to moving France forward after the revolution. Sophie is the young widow that Andre falls in love with and because she is being \"protected\" by her Uncle, really the epitome of evil, Andre's life is in peril. How the paths of these four characters cross and how their lives become connected represented one level of the story - these individuals, the love and friendship, hopes and dreams. The bigger picture also is of what was happening in the country and the role these people played is also depicted. I was especially impressed by the strength and courage of Sophie and especially Marie at a time when women had no rights. I appreciated the authors' note about which characters were real, which were fictional and which were based on real people. It appears that the story was well researched. It is 3.5 stars because of how long it took me to really be engaged but rounded up to 4 stars for the strength of the second half of the book. Recommended to readers of historical fiction. I received an advanced copy of this book from The Dial Press/Random House Publishing Group-Random House through NetGalley and Edelweiss."}, {"userName": "Fran", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12653120-fran", "userReview": "1792, Paris. Three years after the beginning of The French Revolution, more than half the population of Paris was still starving. Hunger, anger, and hatred created bloodlust on execution day at La Place de la Revolution. Based upon The Law of Suspects, \"a mere rumor of a man's royalist leanings...was substantial enough to send him on a tumbril ride to the guillotine.\" The crowd cheered as heads rolled. Anyone could be seized, jailed and subsequently guillotined.Andre Valiere joined the revolutionary cause by swearing allegiance to the new government. Born a nobleman, he hoped his royal birth would be overlooked since he denounced property, possessions and a royal title. Andre's father had been guillotined. Captain Andre Valiere fought alongside General Christophe Kellermann and Brigadier General Nicolai Murant in the Bois de Valmy. The French army was able to prevent a march on Paris that would have reinstalled Louis XVI on the French throne. Christophe Kellermann's status as a decorated war hero was short-lived. His suggestion that Louis XVI be given a fair and honest trial led to his denouncement and imprisonment in Le Temple Prison. Kellermann would be prosecuted by Guillaume Lazare, arguably the finest legal mind in Paris.Jean-Luc St. Clair and wife Marie came to Paris to join the supporters of liberty, equality and fraternity. Jean-Luc worked as an administrative attorney for the new government. He catalogued property seized from wealthy families and managed \"the spoils\". He decided to defend Kellermann with the help of character witness Andre Valiere. Kellermann had saved Andre's life at Valmy. Jean-Luc, an inexperienced lawyer boldly challenged Lazare, adding to, and further complicating, an existing vendetta that attempted to expunge any and all persons, young or old, who possessed noble blood. The Reign of Terror continued to barrel out of control creating a chaotic web sweeping up Andre and Jean-Luc who were trying to live free from fear and oppression.\"Where The Light Falls\" by Allison Pataki and Owen Pataki was an enlightening and enjoyable historical fiction rendering of the plight of nobles, clergy and commoners during The French Revolution. Although the ending seemed a little contrived, I would recommend this tome without reservation. An excellent read.Thank you Random House Publishing Group-Random House and Net Galley for the opportunity to read and review \"When The Light Falls\"."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz", "userReview": "Winter, 1792. What an amazing beginning! This book starts off with a bang. Or should I say a swoosh? From there, we go back in time a few months as Jean Luc St. Clair works for the new government cataloging the properties and goods that formerly belonged to the nobility. He is caught up in the new order and the formation of the new government. His chapters alternate with Andre Valiere\u2019s story, a captain in the Revolutionary Army. This was a part of the French Revolution I knew nothing about. It stands to reason that the rest of Europe wouldn't sit back and allow the destruction of the aristocracy, but I hadn't realized there had been a war between the newly formed France and the rest of the continent. I really liked this book. It told an interesting story. The scenes were all so well drawn, as to take you right into the time and place. The authors do a wonderful job of showing the reader the progression of the aftereffects of the Revolution through the stories of its two main characters; how quickly fear and hatred consumed the country, how questioning any act of the government became sedition, how Revolution quickly became Terror. I like nothing better than an historical novel that teaches and entertains simultaneously and this book did this well. And yes, I'm one of those folks who start researching the actual events while still reading the book. This research shows the facts about a major historical figure were twisted in the book, which disappointed me. The authors do point out this incongruity in their authors\u2019 note but it was a big enough event that it still bothered me. Time and time again, this book made me realize how unique the American Revolution was, because we had no nobility to remove. The French Revolution had way more in common with the Russian Revolution and the need to eliminate the aristocracy, even those that supported the revolution.

If you remember anything about the French Revolution from history class, you remember The Terror; and that is vividly depicted in this book. There was clearly a great deal of research to write this novel, and I love that the authors are siblings. I have read and enjoyed The Accidental Empress by Allison Pataki and have been looking forward to WTLF. This was a slow-building historical, which worked well for me until I got to the middle, and then it felt a little draggy. It picked back up again towards the latter half. I was easily drawn into the characters' lives. I have read some other books about the French Revolution, Napolean, and time period, and this book offered different perspectives - one of a a former noble/military captain, an underpaid lawyer working for the Revolution, and two empowered women for the time. It is hard to fathom how the want for positive change wound up being so blood thirsty and tumultuous. This book had its flaws, but overall was enjoyable for me. I think my friends who enjoy slower-moving historicals will like it, especially if they are already fans of Allison Pataki's writing.2017 Summer Vacation Book #2"}, {"userName": "Marialyce", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1277371-marialyce", "userReview": "If anyone tries to tell you that our American Revolution was just like the one carried on in France, all you need to do is to point them in the direction of this novel to disabuse them of that concept. The French Revolution was a bloody horrible time in which men women, and children were wantonly marched to the guillotine because of either having royal blood or being suspected of possibly having said something that might be interpreted as being in support of the monarchy. A simple passing word or sentence could have been picked up, misinterpreted, or perhaps not even spoken and one could find themselves marching up the steps to their beheading.In this age of fear, lives a young idealistic lawyer, Jean-Luc, his wife, Marie, and a young son. We also are introduced to the young sons of a royally connected family. Both sons, Andre and Remy, are fighting for the Revolution having given up and denounced their royal blood. However, for some this is not enough as we witness the villains of this story in the form of one lawyer and a despicable general who are filled with rage, jealousy, and contempt. These two, the general and the lawyer, want nothing more then to see the young soldiers dead. When Andre falls in love with the niece of the general his days are numbered and his life and that of his beloved Sophie are turned upside down.This tale is woven around these two families and how they interconnect as they all try to fathom the hatred, the wanton killings, and the need for blood that seems to be the path the revolutionaries embarked upon. The authors do a fine job of telling the story while also informing us of the historical nightmare one experienced as they lived in France, particularly Paris, in those days. This was not light fare. It was not a novel that one could breeze through without the many thoughts of the way history has been able to or at least tries to tell us that hate is a derisive, corrosive element in our past as it seems now to be rearing its ugly head in our present as well. We can't forget our past, our history. We can't pretend it never existed for if we do we are doomed to repeat its countless mistakes. This is a book well worth your time if you at all like historical fiction. It also is a cautionary tale of what hate did and how it corrupts and tears apart all that is wonderful about being human."}, {"userName": "Rita", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22264452-rita", "userReview": "I'm giving the last of my 4 giveaways a 2.5 stars rating because I had a hard time forcing myself to read it. I felt like there was something wrong with me because I did not like this book. I love historical fiction. I had taken a history class in college called The French Revolution and Napoleon and really enjoyed it. Most people were giving this book 4 stars. But then I read the negative reviews and this seems to be a book you either love it or hate it. I can't say I really hated it. I just thought it was boring and mediocre. With a book I enjoy, if I get within 50 pages of the ending I can't put the book down until I've finished it. With Where the Light Falls it took me two days to force myself to finish it.The main characters, Jean-Luc and Andre, were flat and unreal. Jean-Luc was the young idealistic lawyer who had dragged his wife and child to Paris to live in poverty, because \"Vive la liberte!\" Andre is of noble birth, in fact he father was sent to the guillotine, hopes that his renouncing of his title and being the army will save him The two main female characters were Marie and Sophie. Marie was the dutiful, supportive wife. Sophie was the proverbial damsel in distress.

Some of them, I admit, should never have been published.So buckle up, folks, you know where this is going.By way of a general introduction, I am compelled\u2014once again\u2014to state Point One: that what bothers me most is the number of reviewers who say they knew little or nothing about the French Revolution and now, after reading This Book, they suddenly know a great deal. Um, no, they don't know squat. This book has as much to do with the historical French Revolution and the Directory as the Harlequin Romance version of Sisi had to do with the real Austrian empress.And Point Two: no, you don't get to mangle history, change dates, make up your own \u201calternate facts\u201d to justify ridiculous plot points, re-invent or contort real historical personages, and then coat the resulting mess with clumsy anachronisms and 21st century people dressed up in costumes, their attitudes and words intact, all of it to highlight the \"fictional\" aspect of historical fiction. Nope. Not. Ever. What we have here, in my never humble opinion, is utter garbage, and not well-written garbage, either.Quite a few reviewers, the ones who just loved this book, found out so much history from it, and adored the characters, have left not reviews but book reports, recounting in often breathless prose, the entire plot, start to finish. So read those if you care to know the story here because I don\u2019t do book reports and haven\u2019t done them since middle school.One of the many faults I found in this book was the lack of character development; everyone was pretty much just like everyone else. Worse, the two paragons of virtue, the lawyer Jean-Luc and the soldier Andr\u00e9, are too good to be believed, and face villains who are presented as men described by one overly-used clich\u00e9 after another. The alleged heroines, both with the obligatory beauty and devotion and other qualities usually found in Harlequin World, have all the substance of toilet tissue, the single-ply variety, and seem to serve little purpose other than smile at and support in a clich\u00e9d manner their respective heroes. Try as I might, I could not care about any of them. But then, paper dolls always were a poor substitute for Chatty Cathy, right? I have always liked the often overused word \u201ccompelling,\u201d and I can say that not one character in this book, including\u2014but not limited to\u2014the two Kens and their Barbies\u2014that are compelling in the slightest.One insightful reviewer characterized this book as a soap opera, and I agree. \u201cDays of Our Revolutionary Lives\u201d or \u201cThe Young and the Revolutionary\u201d or \u201cAll My Revolutionaries\u201d have more appeal and describe what the authors have produced far better than the rather hokey title someone thought would be cute and \u201cliterary.\u201d And as is typical of soap operas, we don\u2019t get much in the way of background. We get a series of backdrops in front of which the [cardboard] characters move, emote [and oh, folks, do they evah!], and talk to one another in awkward American English laced with anachronisms.Despite the somewhat earnest insistence by the authors that they researched, they really, really did lots of research, the resulting history certainly doesn\u2019t show such an alleged effort. History isn\u2019t even much of a bit player in this daytime drama, and when it appears, it\u2019s usually wrong, distorted, or rearranged. If a writer truly knows the difficult craft of writing and practices it with skill, then there\u2019s no need to move major historical events around just to create a \u201ccrisis\u201d for a bunch of ill-conceived characters. A good, capable writer of historical fiction can use the events and persons as they were and when they were, and craft a tale around those. But then, these writers are not skilled. So we see the famous \u201cwhiff of grapeshot\u201d occurring a year earlier than October 1795, and we see Captain Bonaparte relieving the siege at Toulon in 1794, not 1793.A couple of other examples may suffice, although I could most certainly ramble on for days: the authors spend quite a bit of time describing Napoleon\u2019s coronation and miss the facts of Notre-Dame\u2019s complete architectural transformation, the entry really used by the imperial couple, and the fact that Pius VII was escorted every step of the way from Rome to Paris by trusted French generals. A complete mock-up of the original and historically accurate coronation is even on YouTube. The Egyptian Campaign is also total fiction because the historical component is practically invisible, and mostly wrong when it does show up, and I could see the authors were without a clue regarding anything remotely military. As an aside, I found one of the most astonishing choices was to name Andr\u00e9\u2019s Bad Guy, General Murat, after Bonaparte\u2019s future brother-in-law, and who commanded the French cavalry during the Egyptian Campaign. As h authors provided the limp excuse that this \u201cantagonist\u201d was patterned after a real Bad Guy, the comte de Custine. Worse, the other antagonist, Lazare, is a messy conflation of Robespierre, Marat, and H\u00e9bert. Authors who conduct proper research, who understand the era they choose to write about, and other criteria completely missing here understand that one can actually use Real People who Did Real Stuff in their historical fiction. Alas, not these two.Finally, a word or three about that research. I cannot take seriously anyone who uses A Tale of Two Cities and Les Mis\u00e9rables as historical references. As most everyone knows, Les Miz has a bit about Waterloo, for example, but its \u201crevolution\u201d is a small urban workers\u2019 uprising just before 1830. I cannot take seriously anyone who uses films as resources, nor the popular but superficial Osprey Men-At-Arms series. None of these \u201csources\u201d would be permitted in a high school term paper. I admit a soft spot for the Gershoy book, which was the text for my 1966 undergrad class, and Doyle\u2019s book, which I used in grad school. Regardless of the quality\u2014or lack thereof\u2014the sources, I found little from first to last that wasn\u2019t historically embarrassing.My recommendation: pass this one by. Unless, of course, you want to see in black and white a primer on how not to write historical fiction."}, {"userName": "BAM The Bibliomaniac ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6595648-bam-the-bibliomaniac", "userReview": "Many thanks to Allison Pataki, Owen Pataki, Random House, and Netgalley for the free copy of this book in exchange for an unbiased review.This is the trailer park version of A Tale of Two Cities and Les Mis .

For the final 2/3rd of the novel, I was completely engaged in the story. I am thankful that I continued reading beyond the initial third because the novel was beautifully written and as I look back now on the initial 100 pages I can better appreciate the history and details that set up what was to come in the story.My previous favorite Allison Pataki novel was The Traitor's Wife.

This was such a readable book. From the very first chapter I was pulled into the drama, the hate, and the desperation that was France at that time.

I have read several books on the same subject/time period and was worried that might affect my reading experience, but my fears were in vain. The writing really was so good! Clear, colorful, atmospheric. You felt like you were there living through all the brutality and fear. You could almost smell the blood spilled by the guillotine. Strong women feature strongly here as well. My only complaint are some inconsistencies with the actual historical figures. I'm kind of a purist, I like everything to be as accurate as possible. But, this is a novel, and there are great notes at the end which cover what is true & false. (That is also important to me.

Their mastery of the daily events of the Terror and of the military campaigns is evident, but they play fast and loose with some pretty significant events in the interest of creating \u201cturning points\u201d to imperil their characters. All this would be fine if the characters were compelling, but the authors rely on superficial description and stilted, \u201cAmericanized\u201d dialogue.

Upon turning the page, the reader quickly finds him/herself in Paris during the winter of 1792. The deposed King and Queen of France are imprisoned, awaiting trial for treason. The city is in tumult as men with radical ideas and a penchant for dispensing violent, retributive 'justice' have taken control of the national government. Along the streets in a horseborne tumbril are several condemned persons being taken to the Place de la Revolution. Despite the bitter cold, thousands of people eagerly await the spectacle soon to take place before their very eyes. \"They sound impatient, shrill with the heady prospect of fresh blood to wet the newly sharpened guillotine blade.\" The spectacle then takes shape as - one by one - each condemned person is prompted to walk up onto the stage where 'le guillotine' awaits. The condemned person's head is placed within the guillotine's clutches. The audience views the scene with bated breath and fevered anticipation. A blade forming the top part of the guillotine set above the condemned person's head is released and with a swish, swiftly severs the condemned person's head, sending it into a basket set close by. Charles Dickens could have taken some lessons from the 2 writers of this novel, in terms of conveying a real, tangible sense of the early stages of what came to be known as 'The Terror', the darkest period of the French Revolution. The novel then goes on to relate the stories of Jean-Luc St. Clair, a lawyer from Marseille who moved with his young family to Paris, where he works in an office handling claims involving deposed nobles; Andre Valiere, a young army officer of the ancien r\u00e9gime who has forsworn his noble heritage to join the Army of the French Republic; and Sophie de Vincennes, a young widow living under the close eye of a vindictive uncle who has powerful connections within the government. Her fate would later become entwined with Andre's. The reader is carried from the depths of The Terror to the steady rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, who first made a name for himself as a military commander without equal, leading French armies to resounding victories against the Austrians in Italy and later in Malta and Egypt. All the while, France is in turmoil with the demand for justice breeding more paranoia and instability. \"Jean-Luc, Andre, and Sophie find themselves bound together in a world where survival seems increasingly less likely - for themselves...\" This novel has all the hallmarks of a Class A thriller.

Set in Paris in the years after the revolution, Allison and Owen Pataki have written a story that reflects the chaos and terror of the time. Opening with the last days of aristocrat Alexandre de Valiere, they take you from his prison cell to La Place de la Revolution where the guillotine awaits. Andre Valiere, son of the doomed aristocrat, has renounced his title and lands and serves in the army, hoping that this will save him from the same fate. After falling for the niece of an influential general who bears resentment toward him and his family, even his military service may not save him.Jean-Luc St Clair is a young lawyer from the south of France who has left his position in his father-in-law's firm to do his part for the new government in Paris. While his wife struggles with food shortages and caring for their young son, he is assigned to inventory the contents of estates seized from condemned nobles. Hoping to advance, he makes connections with a powerful lawyer. As his own influence grows, so do the dangers facing him and his family.This is a fascinating look at an important part of French history. Although there are small changes in the timeline of events, the narrative gives the reader the ability to experience these events and their effects on the people of France.

The story is really 2 stories ones, that of Andre, Army captain whose father was guillotined, but he has sworn his allegiance to the new republic and his pursuit of love in an unsettled time and that of Jean-Luc, a young lawyer, husband, and, father working for the new republic, but trying to bring a sense of normalcy to the chaos of the revolution. The authors seamlessly weave historical people such as Robespierre and Louis and Antoinette into the story to lend authenticity. It's a sweeping story that give us a peek a tumultuous time in world history without being dull or dry in any way."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6472696-julie", "userReview": "4.5/5 I don't read a lot of books on the French Revolution but Les Miserables is one of my favorite musicals. So I wasn't sure what to expect picking this one up but I was pulled in immediately to the stories of Jean-Luc, Andre and Sophie. How they intertwined their stories was wonderful.What hell the Revolution must have been. It shows that those calling for one don't always really have the best interest of the people at the heart. I highly recommend this novel for all historical fiction fans, even if the French Revolution isn't your normal time period."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1065846-cindy", "userReview": "I won !"}, {"userName": "Cher", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher", "userReview": "2.5 stars - It was alright, an average book. Not painful, but also not very remarkable or memorable.

It was slow, the characters were flat and the final \"showdowns\" were so over the top stupid they were rather unfulfilling after 380 pages. The book follows two characters during the French Revolution. One is an overly just and good lawyer in a sea of corrupt and evil ones. The other is an overly just and good solider in a sea of incompetent and/or evil generals. Both are desperate to keep their heads down so as to not face the guillotine. Both have a lady by their side, the lawyer - his wife, the soldier - the one woman he cannot have. That is about the depth of their character development. The lawyer is supposed to inventory the estates of the newly imprisoned rich (for what purpose we have no idea) but instead keeps taking charity cases that pit him against the ruling lawyers of the day. He is astute, except for when it comes to his own wife (who is the one character they should have dived into more! Such a wasted golden opportunity), works far too much and yeah, isn't overly clever or intelligent, just good hearted and idealistic. The soldier has rejected his family's title and joined the army in hopes of not meeting the guillotine. He fights in several key battles at the time, which is used to introduce and incorporate real people from the period including Bonaparte. His father's name gets him out of some scrapes, but overall he's just this shy guy who is good at heart and really just doesn't want to lose his head. Both men are, through no fault of their own, antagonized by a nemesis hell bent on their destruction for reasons that, in the lawyer's case just don't make any sense, and for the soldier are just boring and cliche. (We also find out the entire reason the soldier is being hunted by his enemy in a poorly laid out info-dump by a very random character. The soldier does nothing to piece it together himself! Very unsatisfying for the reader, as this is one of the main questions throughout the entire story.) The book did an incredible joy providing a groundwork history of the French Revolution. It places the reader in the middle of this chaotic and unjust time in France where the ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity are being shouted in the streets and then totally ignored as aristocrats, clergy, good men and women (and children) are beheaded for no other reason than their birth or daring to whisper against the corrupt, ever-changing leaders who use public opinion (aka mob mentality) to kill their rivals and instill fear towards anyone who dares question them. Pataki always does a great job in setting and her research is amazing, but it's in the interactions of her characters her books fail. The battle scenes were well written and pulled on your emotion. They did a great job at relaying the chaos and giving us real emotion from the soldiers involved (something I credit to Owen who served in Afghanistan). If you want to read a book to understand the background and day to day of the French Revolution, pick up this book. But don't read it for the characters and just be warned about the final showdowns, they really are quite an eye roll."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47275953-brian", "userReview": "I received (actually my wife did) this book through a Give-away on Good reads in exchange for an honest review.I originally rated this book a 4, but after a couple of weeks of thinking about this review, I upped it to a 5. I really enjoy Allison Pataki's writing style. For me it is very easy to read, and flows along smoothly. I enjoy the details of description, but they never become overbearing. That being said, I noticed a difference in the ebb and flow in certain sections of the book. For example, the battle scene in Egypt. It seemed a little herky jerky, and left me thinking. Huh? How did he (Andre) do that. I have to assume those portions were more heavily written by Owen. Understand, the difference was not enough to change the overall perception of the book, just noticeable differences I never experienced while reading The Accidental Empress or The Traitors Wife.But, back to the book. The overall feel and historical overtones were excellent. It is evident the author immerses herself in the history and culture of the areas she is writing about. She seems to pick up the feel and vernacular, even the rhythm of speech regardless if the character is in Paris, Budapest, or New York. But again, back to this book, I found the characters to be very well developed and in some cases almost too real. There were those who were so hateful and evil that I wanted to skip that section because of what I thought they might do next. Then, there were characters that you could not help but like and think that I could really get along with them. I give the book a 5 star rating because of the realism of the characters, and the realism of the setting for this story. Yes, some of the story does not follow actual history, but for those who seem to pounce on that fact my advice is: Get over it! This is a novel, not a textbook!

The content of this review is not influenced by that fact. The feelings expressed are solely mine.More accurate rating is 4.5 starsFantastic historical novel! It did what I thought up until a few weeks ago was impossible -- made the French Revolution engaging and exciting! Ok , I suppose I should clarify my comment. I love historical fiction of all times periods and locations but I tend to pass on anything during this time frame. The reason being four L-O-N-G years of French language classes in school. The last year was mostly learning about French culture and history (in French of course) and after I graduated I promptly forgot everything I learned. We actually spent most of the time going over and over anything one could possibly want to know about the Louis'. We touched only briefly on the revolution, reign of terror, and the rise of Napoleon. Although I'll be honest and say my French history is still lacking I had zero trouble following this book. It was so well written that it did not even for a minute feel like I being taught a lesson but apparently I was because I learned so much. I also enjoyed the way Napoleon was treated. He was painted in a truer light than the British propaganda of the times (megolamaniac with little man syndrome). In this book Napoleon was accurately portrayed as a brilliant tactician and beloved by the people. Not only the character descriptions of famous people but also fictional characters in this story were really good! If I didn't know which were which I would have had no problem believing all were actual people. (The authors' notes do clarify for those who need help figuring it all out. Also there are notes there indicating the liberties with timeline the authors took in order to create a more engaging and flowing FICTIONAL story. Why do people get so worked up when an author does this? It's fiction people! If you want a play by play account read non-fiction. Better yet read both!) So why you may ask have I subtracted a half star? That is because there were a few scenes where there was a perceptible change in the flow and vernacular of the writing. I wonder if this was change between authors as this is a shared endeavor by siblings Allison and Owen Pataki. I am not saying either \"voice\" was weaker only obviously different. I wish the authors would have hammered out those fluctuations before release. Also-- and this is completely a personal preference for me-- the first few chapters seemed very battle heavy. A little too much for my taste in reading especially before I've become invested in characters and the overall story. So with those admittedly minor detractors I'm still calling this book a must read for anyone who enjoys intelligent historical fiction."}, {"userName": "Annette", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13005524-annette", "userReview": "This book brings interesting historical facts skillfully woven into the story with vivid imagination of the chaotic French Revolution. However, the most interesting parts are short, leaving to wish more for such scenes. For example, a lawyer representing poor widow expelled from her property. This reveals not only a dramatic situation of the common people of that period, but also an ancient law of the Landlord Right. Instead the book is filled with stagnant scenes not moving the story forward or moving at snail pace.The story starts in 1792, when Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette are already imprisoned. Jean-Luc St Clair, a lawyer from the South of France, moves his family to Paris as he believes in freedom of common people. His noble cause puts his family, wife and baby, through poverty.

The monarchy has been dismantled and a new nation, for the people, is rising up in its place.

Sophie, a beautiful young aristocratic widow and niece of a powerful, vindictive uncle, embarks on her own fight for independence.Underneath the glimmer of hope and freedom, chaos threatens to undo all the progress of the revolution and the lives of these compatriots become inextricably linked. As the demand for justice breeds instability, creates enemies out of compatriots, and fuels a constant thirst for blood in the streets, Jean-Luc, Andre, and Sophie are forced to question the sacrifices made for the revolution.
