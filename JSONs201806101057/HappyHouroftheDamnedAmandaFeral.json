It goes from potty mouth to \"pissy cooch\" in less than 60 seconds and that's what makes it so fun. It's got an all-encompassing menagerie of freaks and monsters, including Starbucks baristas (with appropriately abusive commentary on their quality). Mary Henry quickly establishes the normalcy of horror and gore in his version of Seattle, and then makes light of it in exchange for fashion, cocktails, and dance clubs. If you loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer for its snark and the way it never took itself too seriously, then this book will feel like it grew out of those teenage years into the same raunchy, drunk, and horny freak that you have."}, {"userName": "Lori Whitwam", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/715797-lori-whitwam", "userReview": "What a treat! Funnier than Mary Janice Davidson, and also more quirky, twisted and gory (all positives!). What happens to a beautiful advertising executive when she discovers she is now a zombie? Well, if it's Amanda, she mostly takes it in stride and becomes the toast of the undead club scene. Then her friend (who is a succubus) turns up missing, and with her friends Wendy (also a zombie) and Gil (a gay vampire), she sets out to find her. Unfortunately there's a lot more going on in Seattle's undead community, and they find themselves in the middle of it. Also unfortunately, zombies do NOT heal from injuries, which just sucks when you can't figure out how to patch together that gaping flesh wound. (Definite flavors of Jen Lancaster's memoirs, in the categories of bitchy and self-centered... in a fun way!) I'm trying to remember if I've ever read a book in which the zombies are the good guys, and I can't think of any. While horror-based chick-lit is everywhere, this has a unique angle and style, and is well worth the read. (Eagerly awaiting the next volume!!! Road trip of the Living Dead!) I asked the author if he minds people commenting on a guy writing such detailed, realistic chick-lit, and he's fine with it! :-) This is clearly a guy who has paid close attention to the women in his life!"}, {"userName": "Mandi Schreiner", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2704703-mandi-schreiner", "userReview": "Amanda Feral likes to eat. Now, since she was turned into a zombie five months ago, her diet has gone from food, to err\u2026humans. She enjoys eating them too though. Her best friend, fellow zombie Wendy and pal, vampire Gil are quite the trio. A typical night out for them includes hanging at the hip paranormal spot, the Well of Souls, drinking alcohol (the one thing a zombie can digest besides human flesh) and snarking on everyone around them. They are bitchy, arrogant, and proud to be that way.In pre-zombie days, Amanda was a successful ad executive, until the one fateful night some really gross dude breathed on her, and then seconds later Amanda tripped and cracked her skull. When she woke up, her body temperature was a cool 68 degrees and her skin took on a lovely translucent tone, highlighted with blue veins. Amanda has become an expert at applying makeup to appear \u201cnormal\u201d and has come up with creative ways to keep her therapist, who is also her bed buddy (but hey she doesn\u2019t have to pay him..in money) from noticing this change.Amanda and gang now have another task besides drinking and gossiping, their friend Liesl has gone missing. Amanda takes it upon herself to do some investigative work and what she starts to uncover is a pretty scary plan corrupt Seattle and the world with zombies.I was warned before reading Happy Hour of the Damned. Heck, I was warned by the author that the book has a certain type of humor that not everyone will enjoy. I had some bloggers tell me this is one of the funniest books they had ever read. Others warned me that the humor is gross and disgusting and they couldn\u2019t see the appeal. Now those that know me well, know I have a somewhat immature sense of humor, and I live in a house full of men, so the conversation always ends up in the bathroom (sorry men, it\u2019s true.) So I said bring it on. Plus, the title contains the words \u201cHappy Hour\u201d \u2013 Smexy\u2019s favorite two words!Even with the warnings, there were times my mouth hung open. I laughed until my stomach hurt, and just when I would tell myself, wow, this book can\u2019t get more shocking, it would. What I loved most about this book is Amanda\u2019s forthright demeanor. She is a zombie. Zombie\u2019s eat people to live, hence Amanda eats people. There is no remorse, or morals in play. They go on \u201cfun runs\u201d where they rent a van and park at the welfare agency. They pretend to screen applicants and agree to get them to go in the van. I don\u2019t need to tell you what happens inside the van. Well, she won\u2019t eat a kid, and she normally eats those that are less fortunate, but they are still people. At first I was a little surprised there was no explanation for her actions. But I like that this is how she is. This is how a zombie in the \u2013 real world \u2013 would act. Plus Amanda is just a bitch. She is shallow, offensive, and conceded and it totally works.Her friend Wendy is just as sarcastic and snarky, if not worse. Add in Gil, the gay vampire, and their observations of the paranormal world will have you giggling throughout. And getting back to the bathroom humor \u2013 let me just say, zombies can\u2019t digest anything but humans or alcohol but that doesn\u2019t mean Amanda and Wendy don\u2019t crave a Starbucks every now and then. Instead of drinking and spending an unpleasant time in the bathroom their solution is to wear Depends. They carry them around in their purse and some of the funniest moments in the book come when they are discussing this problem.What really made the book unique and notched up the humor level even more are the footnotes throughout the entire book. As Amanda is narrating the story, the footnotes provide further humorous observations and it got to the point where my eye would roam to see when we were getting the next one.For a third of the book, Amanda takes us on a flashback telling us how she became a zombie and how she met Amanda and Gil. Amanda and her became bosom buddies after bonding over how to cover their blue veined skin with make-up:\u201cI have no intention of walking around looking like the underside of a hard-on.\u201d \u201dNo way! Wendy screamed, turning from the boxes and shoving my shoulder. I jumped back, my eyes wide. \u201cJesus, what?\u201d \u201dI can\u2019t believe you call them that,\u201d she said, turning back toward me, a second tub of foundation clutched to her chest, like an Emmy. \u201cI call them scrotal veins.\u201d \u201dGet the fuck out of here. You\u2019re my new best friend.\u201dAlthough I liked seeing how the gang meets, this is where the story slows down. Once we get back to present day, and the plot develops around their missing friend and an evil scheme for a zombie world domination, the pace picks up and flows much more smoothly.On top of all the funnies (and they are constant in this book), there is a mystery to be solved. Poor Liesl is missing, and as Amanda says, \u201cChrist, how are we going to help. Not a caring nurturer in the bunch.\u201d And that is true \u2013 they don\u2019t freak out and run to the rescue. Wardrobe and hair must be considered, and you can never forget about dinner. At one point Amanda even admits, \u201cI hadn\u2019t been focused on finding Liesl with any sincerity. I\u2019m embarrassed to admit, I was still a bit irritated that she had taken the entire focus away from me.\u201dHappy Hour of the Damned is probably not for everyone, but it definitely worked for me. So different than any paranormal or urban fantasy book I have read. I very much look forward to the next two in the series."}, {"userName": "Tiffany Danner", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1373937-tiffany-danner", "userReview": "Confession Time: Zombies. Totally not my thing and not sexy. I think this could be the very first zombie book I have read, but it won\u2019t be the last! Contrary to popular belief zombies do not always walk around chanting brains. If they are lucky enough to be \u201cmade\u201d zombies, like Amanda Feral, they can continue to function as they did before death, mostly. The exception being the devastating (and totally gross) side effects of eating real food, pale skin even a spray tan won\u2019t fix, and the desire for human flesh. Other than those minor things, they can carry on with their lives as usual. Amanda Feral is trying to do just that, refusing to give up her designer clothes, power career, or warm blooded boyfriend just because she is dead. Unfortunately the afterlife isn\u2019t so easy for her when one of her friends seemingly goes missing and she finds herself in over her head in someone\u2019s attempt to stage a world takeover, one Starbucks at a time.Amanda Feral and friends are quite possibly the most foul mouthed, snarky, and sarcastic group of characters I have come across yet. They are dirty ~ and I don\u2019t mean \u201cspank me\u201d dirty, I mean \u201cdepends\u201d dirty. Their brand of humor is not for the easily offended or light of heart. Living with an experienced master of inappropriate jokes and sarcasm, aka my husband, I figured I was up for the challenge. A few times I found myself cringing because Mark Henry holds nothing back, gore and bowels are not off limits. However, most of the time I found myself silently snickering and snorting along at bad jokes and hilarious storytelling. Mark Henry seems to have the unique ability of making the gory act of zombies eating humans perfectly normal, if not funny.I have only one itty bitty complaint\u2026footnotes. Happy Hour of the Damned is filled with footnotes, giving you little tidbits of info sure to make you snort out loud. Because I didn\u2019t want to miss any of the funny, I wasn\u2019t about to ignore their existence, but I did find them a tad distracting when reading it on the Kindle. Obviously, this is not the fault of the author, but this may be one of those series that are better off read in paperback where you can flip back and forth easily (*gasp* yes, I did indeed say that\u2026 mark your calendars!). Being a diehard Kindle lover who avoids dead tree books if at all possible, I did come up with a method that was workable and figured I would share because I am a generous girl like that.Step 1. Before you get reading, use the \u201cgo to location\u201d function from the kindle menu of the book to go to the back of the book and find the start of the footnotes section. Hit Alt+B to bookmark it.Step 2. Start reading. When you get to a foot note use the \u201cgo to bookmark\u201d function to navigate to your bookmark. (On the K1 all you do is click on the progress bar and then hit the \u201cnext\u201d button \u2013 I don\u2019t know if this is true for the K2).Step 3. Read the usually hilarious footnote, then hit the \u201cback\u201d button.Step 4. Continue reading to next footnote and then repeat procedure. Since there are a lot of footnotes in this book and for some reason each one is on a seperate \u201cpage\u201d, I did reset the bookmark location every 3-4 footnotes so I would have less to page through.Because of Mark Henry\u2019s foul mouthed crew of comediens I give Happy Hour of the Damned 4 stars. It was fun to read an urban fantasy with main characters who were not battling with moral dilemmas and ethical questions. I can\u2019t wait to see what else Amanda Feral can get herself into. Next up, Road Trip of the Living Dead."}, {"userName": "Larissa Ione", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2132860-larissa-ione", "userReview": "Loved this book!

Black humor and raw humor and crudity wrapped in designer clothes. The book is laugh-out-loud funny, which is odd to me because most satirical looks at our current society tend to be of the droll and dry variety. But this is clearly satire, sending up our books, our television and the modern American worldview in the light of a status-obsessed woman with a newly developed taste for flesh. Henry has a clear style, writing for Feral, that really embodies the SITC voice, but with a good eye for descriptive language and a literary ability to phrase and shape the story."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/146467-peter", "userReview": "High-larious.

She isn't one of those mindless mistakes that are basically walking hunger that will eat anything that gets in their way. She can think. When one of her new friends goes missing, she gets drawn into an ever deepening mystery which just might lead to a more permanent death.I am pretty sure that I know what the author was aiming towards when he wrote this story. I think he figured that it would be fairly hard to make a truly sympathetic character that went around eating people. So he decided to make an over the top, sardonic character that was in no way apologetic for her actions. She would be an edgy, non-politically correct character that is more interested in fashion than in being a hero.Before I go into how I felt about this story, you need to answer a question or two. Did you enjoy the TV show Sex in the City? How about South Park or Beavis and Butthead? Would you like to see these shows combined? If you answered yes to any or all of these, then skip this review and read this book as quick as you can because you will love it. If you answered no to all of them, then skip it because you will hate it. If you still aren't sure, read on but know that there will be mild spoilers.First off, the characters are horrible. The main character is vain, not very bright, rude, crude, and vulgar. She is so inept at solving the mystery (which she even admits) that I doubt she could solve the mystery in a game of clue even if she cheated. She is cowardly. She suffers from low self-esteem which she tries to overcome by insulting anyone around her, including her so-called friends. Speaking of her friends, they are basically poor copies of her. The villains of the book are barely defined. Anyone else in the book is solely there to be ridiculed (and then killed) or to act as dues ex-machina for the lame main character.The author does deserve credit for devising a way to make a thinking zombie. But there are some things that just don't work or make sense. She becomes a zombie because a zombie \"breathed\" on her. Since zombies don't breathe, I am sure the author thought this made perfect sense. I am also guessing that he totally forgot that you have to breathe when talking. So even if zombies don't need to breathe, air has to be going in and out for them to talk. The zombies also have the ability to unhinge their jaws letting them take much bigger bites. This would be fine except that they snap them shut with great force while they are unhinged. Creatures unhinge their jaws to be able to swallow more but it causes them to lose pressure required to snap their jaws at that time. The zombies are described as eating people in as few as five bites. Two zombies manage to eat 3 teenage boys in just a few minutes. I have no problem with them eating flesh, bones, and the rest of the human. But there is no way they could fit that much mass into their stomachs without some serious distortion. Also the zombies suffer explosive diarrhea if they eat anything besides human or drink alcohol. (For some reason, all of the different undead can drink alcohol. The only reason seems to be so they can all hang out in bars all of the time.) Finally, the solution of wearing adult diapers when they eat other things just wouldn't work. From his several descriptions, the reaction was explosive and highly fragrant which a diaper would not stop or prevent others from noticing.Looking at the mystery, it is a joke. The initial mystery wasn't really a mystery. The mystery that develops while she is stumbling around is fairly convoluted and easily avoided if the bad guys had just left the main character alone.Let's look at plotting, the humor, and finally those inserts and footnotes. The plotting was pitiful. You hear about the friend going missing in the first chapter. This is followed by a flashback that lasts for nearly a hundred pages and even has a another flashback inside of it. The reader is often given large lists of fashion or furniture setting (and their prices) in the middle of conversations. The main character will stop her \"investigation\" for days at a time to basically hang out in bars, Characters and events will be discussed only to be never talked about again. Finally the author contradicts himself on multiple occasions. The humor is best described as toilet humor, The main character says that she refuses to be politically correct but it is really an excuse to make jokes about a person heritage, accent, or sexual orientation. No matter which character (male, female, gay, straight) they end up sounding like a 12 or 13 year old boy making fart jokes. The inserts of playlists and drink recipes were wastes of space. One even had the recipe for a shot of alcohol. The footnotes just seemed to be an excuse to make more snide comments.The last thing that brings this story down to one star is that the author tried to redeem the main character at the end. She says that while she would not have helped a certain individual at the beginning of the story, she would at the end. Now the entire book, the main character has refused to make apologies for anything. That was supposed to be part of the joke. There was no point of redemption for the character. It does not come across as believable or make her more sympathetic. It also seems as a sort of sell-out by the author in that he backs off from his vision of the character as he presented her for the rest of the book.I wish I could have given this book a higher rating. It had a good premise with some nice potential. I also understand that some people really liked it. If you did, more power to you. But for me, it failed in almost every aspect. The nicest thing I can say about it is that it was a quick read and since I found it on a bargain rack, it was cheap. I liked one thing that the main character said. She gives the advice that if you get plastic surgery, try to keep it to small changes and to keep the look natural for the most part. Sounds like good advice so it is hard to believe that she would actually say that though."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/112377-kim", "userReview": "This book is totally disgusting and I mean that in the most literal sense. I start out with that fact because if I recommend a book and you don't like it, well, taste is subjective, but if I recommend one and it gives you nightmares, then I'll feel bad. And the disgust comes not only from the gore factor, because the protagonist is a zombie who eats human flesh, but there is also a great deal of potty humor as well. I raced through those parts (because skimming would seem unfair) but would argue that they are there for a reason, and not simply to gross us out.Amanda Feral is a Seattle-dwelling party girl, label conscious and successful, who has an encounter with a man in an elevator, feels his cold breath on her neck, and subsequently falls and cracks her head open. After a less than satisfying sexual encounter with her boyfriend, she is nearly attacked by a vampire, who abandons his plan to feed from her once he discovers she is an \"above-grounder\" otherwise known as a zombie. Zombiehood comes with a pasty complexion (which Amanda will take great pains to conceal) and nearly white eyes, the ability to survive but not necessarily heal from fatal injuries, the inability to digest regular solid food (though alcohol is somehow okay), and, oh yeah, the need to consume human flesh to survive. However, she is a deliberately created zombie, which means her cognitive functions remain relatively in tact; with the right make up and a bit of self control, Amanda can continue to pass as human.Several reviewers have pointed out that Amanda is not a very sympathetic character, and to a point I would agree with them. She comes across as combination of Karen from Will & Grace, the Sex in the City girls at their cattiest, and Amanda from Ugly Betty. In other words, she is the socialite fashionista type we all love to hate, the kind of person who would sooner die than wear polyester, a scrunchy, or a top from Target. And Amanda never has to----she has to wear Depends, if she chooses to eat regular food----but she can keep her Prada into her afterlife and beyond. So I think that what Henry may be doing here is satirizing the sort of narcissistic label-conscious character we encounter in chick lit, depicting her hedonistic lifestyle as so superficial it is not even interrupted by (un) death. Are you afraid your fashionista boss might bite your head off if you shop at Sears? Maybe you should be more worried that she's just hungry!I can't honestly say I relate to Amanda, but she is snarky and wicked as all get out, and when I wasn't wincing at her descriptions I was definitely laughing. Unfortunately, the plot here is a little thin; when Amanda receives a mysterious text message from her succubus friend Liesl, she discovers a plot to flood the population with the zombies. The story has potential; it just doesn't feel like Henry was as interested in telling this story as in introducing Amanda and her world. But that's an issue that may be resolved in later installments of the series, and I'll be waiting to see whether it is."}, {"userName": "Alejandra", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2783253-alejandra", "userReview": "Ah-Mazing!

However, when those kind of characters also happen to be zombies, vampires, shapechangers, and other assorted supernaturals, my interest is piqued. Throw in a story peppered with snarky footnotes (and who can resist a fiction novel which utilizes footnotes?) and it's amazing how palatable such shallowness can become. For bitchy, self-centered, frivolous fun, this book is the template.However, I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hoped. Eventually the snark and selfishness began to grate on my nerves, which I had somewhat expected, but I believe my annoyance was compounded by the lack of a cohesive plot. A mystery is alluded to in the beginning, which is then put on hold as we explore Amanda's past life, zombification, and current uber-hip state of undeadness. When we get back to the mystery, it's treated by the characters in a very lackadaisical manner (which is typical of shallow people, but still frustrating), very much a case of \"Ooh, a friend is in trouble? But the new club is opening tonight and everyone who is anyone will be there, which means we have to be there! Let's worry about it tomorrow, or whenever the hangover wears off.\" Eventually the mystery is solved, which turns out to not be so mysterious but which leads to a second, more dramatic situation. However, the impact of this second crisis is lessened by the limpness of the first, and the impetus of the book is let down by a meandering storyline. What really bugged me was the blatant hard-on the author had for commas. (And, yes, I realize with that statement I'm coming off like a picky bitch; I was born that way, so deal.) I know I can go a bit gaga for punctuation. If I can use a semi-colon and some hyphens, I'm happy; thrown in a colon and a few ellipses, I'm positively ecstatic. Mark Henry's single-minded punctuation obsession, though, gets in the way of his writing, as he uses commas in multiple locations where they're not needed (and throw off the pace of the sentence) and leaves them out where such clarification a comma would provide is necessary. I realize this is the more the fault of his editor, but since an author and editor are part and parcel of the whole writing procedure, it's still a valid quibble.I can't say I'm excited to read the second book, but I am curious to see what other kinds of mischief Amanda and her pals can get into...and still keep their makeup intact."}, {"userName": "Carolyn  Storer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2449271-carolyn-storer", "userReview": "I have heard a lot about this author, mainly from Natasha (Wicked Little Pixie) via Twitter, who rated this book 5/5.

And it most certainly was!How to describe Amanda Feral... bitchy, snarky, vulgar, foul-mouthed, smart (arse), sexy and totally zombelicious! And dare I say it after all that... likable. Although Amanda is a zombie, through no fault of her own, it doesn't stop her from being utterly fabulous and determined to keep strutting her stuff - makeup, designer clothes and a cocktail in hand are absolute must haves! Unsurprisingly, after getting to know her, Amanda takes the knowledge that she is one of the undead in her stride and isn't too concerned that she now has to eat people - well, a girls got to eat!Some may find the humour in this book not to their tastes but I loved Amanda's character and although she can be a total bitch, she can also be a loyal friend, as her determination to find her missing friend showed, albeit reluctantly. She enjoys gossiping and sipping vodkatinis with her supernatural friends, Wendy (a sister zombie); Gil (a gay vamp) and Liesl (a succubus) in the trendiest night spots and all as bitchy and snarky as each other!There is a plot to Happy Hour of the Damned - Amanda turns pseudo-detective and sets out to find her friend Leisl, who sends a 'Help!\" txt message before disappearing. But what transpires is something completely innocent as well as more sinister. And although I did enjoy this part of the book, for me it was all about Amanda. Amanda is the reason I rushed out and bought book two! *I has me a 'Manda crush ;)*Henry mixes urban fantasy with his obvious comedic talent as well as a smattering of visceral horror. Readers who read urban fantasy but not horror will find some scenes a little gruesome and gory (lots of braaaiinns and well, the rest of the body - waste not want not!). Personally I loved it, but I am a bit of a sicko ;)Verdict:Happy Hour of the Damned is a fun and entertaining read as well as being absolutely hilarious. Yes, it does get a little rushed at the end with maybe too much going on but Henry's timing is superb and Amanda's witty, snarky comments had me chuckling and giggling to myself and occasionally laughing-out-loud.I can't get across enough how wickedly good this book is... so you will just have to read it for yourself - I can't wait to read the second book in this series, Road Trip of the Living Dead (look out for the review soon!).I actually gave this 9/10 on my blog but Goodreads doesn't offer half stars!"}, {"userName": "Vanessa theJeepDiva", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2246752-vanessa-thejeepdiva", "userReview": "I\u2019ve really gotten into reading zombie books lately. Thus far in my zombie reading adventures it has been the upmost importance to kill the zombies. They are evil vicious, carrying around a fatal disease that is easily spreadable. They must die. That is not this zombie book. The two main characters are zombies. Amanda and Wendy are (un)living it up diva style, complete with a gay male bestie and a succubus. These zombies biggest daily goal is to go clubbing, drink plenty of booze (it\u2019s the only other thing they can consume) and try to out attire the whole club. This book is a snarkfest. It also houses the best and most one liners in any single book that I have ever read. \tOne night while out clubbing Amanda receives a text from their succubus friend Liesl, she simply requests help. In their attempt to find her they uncover so much more than they ever expected. Someone is attempting to unleash a zombie outbreak. The problem is that the villain is not unleashing made zombies. The villain is turning the mistakes out on to the caffeine addicted humans. The mistakes are mindless zombies that are having only one thought\u2026. sweetbreads (bet you were thinking brains.) Neither Amanda nor any of her friends are private investigators. The adventure that ensues is full of bloopers and mistakes. They begin the task of finding their missing friend. During the course of this journey the readers are given a glimpse of how they came to be in their group and how they came to be the supernatural creatures they are. \tWhat some may not like about this book: It is at times graphic in some of the zombie take out dining descriptions. This book has footnotes, have not seen these since my college years and they were never this humorous. The book is written memoir style. There are drink recipes scattered throughout the pages. (Do try the Well of Souls Green Demon p.245, tasty little vodka treat.) Amanda has also given the readers quite a few suggested musical playlists throughout the book. One also has to wonder if Amanda has a severe case of ADHD. The flow of the book skips around a bit and at times seems a bit bouncy. These are things some people may not like. I thought each of these quirks added to the uniqueness of this book. This book is very interesting. The world that has been created with the two different types of zombies and the different ways zombies are created is very different from all of the other zombie books out there."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1027031-angela", "userReview": "Okay, all you Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans on my Friends list, remember Cordelia? Now, think how she might have turned out if, instead of going down to L.A. and winding up joining the cast of Angel as a wannabe-actress-turned-mother-of-an-unholy-horror, she grew up to become an ad exec in Seattle. Keep her keen fashion sense and snarky bitchiness. And oh yes, turn her into a zombie.Once you've done this, then you have Amanda Feral, heroine of Mark Henry's Happy Hour of the Damned, which is in a word HY-larious.The zombie thing works on the grounds that in this universe, zombies come in two flavors: those who are \"made\", and who therefore retain higher brain functions and do not decompose as long as they regularly consume human flesh, and those who are \"mistakes\", the more traditionally Romero-esque shambling automatons with a hankering for tasty cerebellums. I can't attest to the accuracy of the snark directed at the club-hopping scene in Seattle, but it sure as hell reads well, and it should surprise no one the slightest bit familiar with this city that coffee--and our most famous purveyor of same--is a critical plot point. So are unrepentant depictions of several of the more disgusting bodily functions involved with being a zombie. 'Cause, well, you know, zombies.

Normally I'm a big fan of fiction with footnotes. It's useful when getting a little background information for an obscure reference. In that case the footnotes help the reader to get a better sense of the book, and it's \"world.\" In this book the footnotes are the main character's thoughts. I find them to be rather annoying. The book is written in 1st person. I guess I don't really think that it's necessary to put the person whose talking thoughts into a footnote. I understand that the intent seems to be humorous, but I think some of it is lost with footnotes. Also the footnotes slow me down, and I'm not a big fan of that.Having finished the book, I've come to the conclusion that it just wasn't for me.

Besides calling it zombie chick-lit urban fantasy, which is such a disservice. Amanda isn't the type of main character I usually enjoy reading about, I admit I'd rather read about someone more sympathetic than a label-conscious, cocktail swigging, loose, uppity, self-absorbed diva. But guess what, I actually liked her. Go figure. Now I wouldn't want to hang out with someone like her in real life, but in a book, it's all in good fun and I definitely will pick up the next two Amanda Feral books and hope there's more to come.I loved the snarkiness, the footnotes (how many fiction authors actually do that?), the memoir-style writing, the cleverness of it all, it's a very good book. So why didn't I give it a higher rating, you may be thinking. Or maybe you're not. Whatever. Well, it did lose me a couple places and the plot meandered a bit in the beginning, and I'm still not sure what the master plot entailed (or is it entrailed? LMAO :D) exactly, as the plot did get a bit confusing towards the end. That could have just been me, I'm not the brightest at times. However, I think I did get the gist of the whole thing, so I wasn't left completely confused. In addition, I didn't find myself absorbed in the book, meaning I could put it down without withdrawal symptoms, so that brings my rating down slightly. I found the best thing to do with HAPPY HOUR OF THE DAMNED was to just let the book take me for the bizarre and fun ride the author had in store for the readers.I'm sorry to hear that the series is in trouble, as it's much better than a lot of urban fantasy out there. We snarks of the world need these brainy reads (the fun kind) to survive, so in a way, we're zombies too. You may be wondering, \"What can I do to help a good author out?\" Well, go buy it! But only if you don't mind foul language, queasy and disgustingly gory scenes and imagery, sex in all it's kinkiness (which is mostly mentioned in passing), brand name designers, in-the-gutter-humor and more!

Amanda ends up on a mystery case looking into the incidents of what happened to her friends, just to stumble upon a bigger mystery with the pesky mistake zombies showing up in herds at Starbucks.Amanda is a character I enjoyed. She is hard, bitchy, and self-centered. Amanda makes flying leaps at growth in her character in this book. She makes friends with others similar to her in her manor of thinking. We learn how Amanda meets each of these characters through their fun incidents in the first section of the book. Then after we get to know them we find somewhere along the way Amanda has started to worry about them. And starts to enjoy life. Amanda and her friends make comments and jokes of things that many might find mean, but it is said in fun with these characters. I had to chuckle many times with the jokes made and the priorities of the characters. Oh, and who would want to break into a funeral home? I loved that scene.I enjoy the writing style in this book. Mark Henry uses a unique writing style as we are getting the story from Amanda's view. There are footnotes sporadically through the book in which Amanda makes comments to add her inner thoughts at the moment.

(It wasn't much.)Instead of focusing on the plot or anything meaningful, far more attention is given to what the characters are wearing and what their genitalia look like.

When Amanda and her friends were applying themselves to the mystery, their incompetence and squeamishness was funny. When the plot started to fulfill itself, the book lost steam.
