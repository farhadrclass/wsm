But I'm just getting tired of it. I've tried two times to read it. It's always due back at the library and there are other books that are more pressing or interesting to finish before it.I like any books that talk about healthy ways of eating and living. But I really don't like books (particularly ones on food and diet) that give you the suggested shopping list and recipes. I can't afford 3/4 of the stuff they recommend! And heaven knows if I would know how to cook it. I have been learning to adapt my own way of eating--how often, meal portions, and more healthful foods--so that I've reached a point where the book just seems like a drag for me to finish. However, I will continue to recommend it to others for I have seen it have some amazing results with some of my friends and co-workers."}, {"userName": "MelissaS", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/805366-melissas", "userReview": "Though the title of this book is \"YOU on a Diet\" - this book is not really a \"diet\" book, as in how to lose weight fast ... it is more of a \"lifestyle change\" book. The premise of the book is this: if you truly understand how your body works, you will be more motivated to eat healthy and exercise. This lifestyle change will enable you to find your body's optimal weight, and make weight loss more permanent as you develop consistent eating and exercise habits.The key what has made the book popular is the way in which he describes how the body works: what it does with what you eat, and how it burns energy and stores fat. He describes what are sometimes complicated biological processes in very simple terms, using cartoonish pictures and diagrams, and using very corny humor to keep your attention, and to keep you reading quickly. As such, the book is very easy to read (though the frequent humor can get annoying!), and easy to finish quickly. More importantly, you come away very motivated to eat healthy, because you understand why certain things we eat are SO good for us, and why certain things we eat are SO bad. Armed with this knowledge, it is much easier and more exciting to eat healhty, to exercise ... and it is much easier to avoid things that are toxic to our bodies - things like sugar and fast food that we usually have such a hard time avoiding."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/328157-kristin", "userReview": "I saw a show on Oprah where Drs Oz & Roizon helped a chunky, tired middle-aged woman lose weight, tone up and eventually look really hot. I bought this book hoping it would motivate me to do the same. Somehow, I still have the same 20 pounds to lose.The cutesy style with lots of puns and silly drawings gets annoying after awhile, but it has lots of good, solid advice on how to lose weight and live a healthier life.

Some doctors like to suggest cures to symptoms instead of cures for the problem and it appears that these gentleman may be doing just that. The gimmicky (and funny) \"waist management\" technique is interesting and fairly unique from what I've seen, but it can be seen as just a diversion. Maybe people who are obese need a diversion and need to stop thinking about food, but it's my experience that people need to focus on how they were designed (we were designed to constantly eat) and then cater to that by eating the right types of foods at certain times. Roizen and Mehmet's humorous approach reminds me of one of my favorite diet/nutrition books, \"The Evolution Diet,\" which makes learning about the body entertaining as well as informative. Perhaps the author(s) of the You On a Diet could have focused more on the appropriation of one's diet as The Evolution Diet, Second Edition does, but it appears that people can really be helped with these techniques and that's the main goal- a fitter world."}, {"userName": "Tonya", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2787125-tonya", "userReview": "While the humor in the book tried a bit too hard (and was at moments off-putting) the essential message was a good one.

For me the book isn't so much about diet. Actually it's not about being on any type of diet. What the book is about are the fundamentals of what goes on in the anatomy of the body. To read about the wonders of the human body is fascinating to me.. He is very specific in how the body takes in food and breaks down food. I like reading about what happens, why it happens, and how it happens that the food you choose effects eveything that can happen to your body."}, {"userName": "Nupur", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6009820-nupur", "userReview": "So if you're one of those people who are trying to lose weight like me, am sure you suffer from information overload but help starvation. Well, here's some help.For some time, I kept whimpering I needed to lose weight, but actually didn't know what to do different...I was eating the right kinds of food and knew had to get in some exercise. When I was diagnosed with Thyroid, I used that to justify why I was putting on weight. But I still wanted to lose it. Now we all know that we need to cut out carbs, sugars saturated fats and get in some exercise to be a picture perfect shape. In that sense, the book really isn't that different. So when the husband (who himself went from.230 lbs to 167 lbs in five months) saw Dr. Oz on Oprah one day, he got the book and actually thrust it into my hands. And me, with my ultra cynical view of the world kept thinking...\u201dWhat can be so different about another diet book?\u201d Was I wrong or was I wrong!!What is different, and delightfully informative, about the book is that it explains the process behind us gaining weight and what we need to do (including the hows and whys) to lose it. And no, it does not go into scientific mumbo-jumbo...the entire book is in pure layman's terms. So you'll read about the science behind feeling hungry, why, where and how you store calories, what cholesterol does, what's the real deal with fat, why you should keep an eye on your waist size and not calories, why losing weight takes so long, etc.. and actually understand it.Along the way, Dr. Oz and Dr. Roizen bust some very common myths and provide the facts instead. Cartoons, examples, whatever they could use to simplify scientific jargon, they have. At the very end of the book, you get the YOU diet and activity plan which promises to shave off two inches off your waist in two weeks to get to your ideal size. To not exclude those with far more serious health problems and considering medical intervention, they also discuss current options for surgery and drugs.So has it helped me personally? I think so. I did finally get my Bally's gym membership and try to be as regular as possible. But more importantly, I at least think I can do it. I don't constantly have to think about diet food anymore. A word of caution...this is NOT a diet book. It will not put a new spin on an old diet; it is not going to give you a plan on the platter and make you feel like scum if you have that one slice of chocolate cake; it is not going to make you starve till you get thin and put the weight right back on as soon as you stop. It is a book to make you understand the why and how of healthy living. So if you're tired of yo-yo dieting, doing so much and still not seeing results, I'd say pick it up and read it cover to cover. You have nothing to lose, except those extra rings around your tummy."}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2936507-josh", "userReview": "This book contains an absolutely refreshing view of not only the way we should eat, but of the way we need to live our lives. Most diet plans are so extreme that it is not surprising that people are unable or unwilling to stick with them. Diet plans that are not sustainable will not work for anyone long-term, whether they are celebrity-endorsed, or promise a huge amount of weight loss in little or no time. Most people simply need to learn about food, how digestion works, and what happens to the food after you eat it. Knowing this information cuts through most of the bogus hype associated with the multi-billion-dollar-per-year dieting industry. You will be able to see empty and impossible claims from the time you first lay eyes on them. And by the end of the book, you will know what you need to do to begin your own waist management program.Most of the book deals with the ins and outs of the way our bodies use the food we eat. It also discusses how we destroy our own bodies simply by eating foods we should stay away from. Roizen and Oz advise their readers concerning what we should eat, how much, and why those foods are beneficial to our overall health, wellness, and well-being. They do not endorse any exotic nutritional supplements; everything we need can be found at our local grocery stores. The way they present this information is very accessible and easy to understand.If there is one thing that gets annoying about the book is their constant use of sarcasm when discussing bad eating and activity habits. A few of them are funny and charming, but the almost constant barrage got old and became almost counter-productive. However, the truth of their sarcasm is cause enough for each reader to think about their bad eating and activity habits and to propel them into a better, healthier waist management lifestyle.I liked the book and would recommend it to anyone that is ready to do something about improving their lifestyle. If you are looking for another \u201cdiet plan\u201d to try out, look somewhere else."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1938321-holly", "userReview": "I read this book a few years ago, and did the plan, but did not stick with it afterwards. I recently reviewed the book, and I think the main problem was too much time spent preparing meals and snacks, all of which were healthy. The book emphasises exercise, and gives some really great tips that I do like, and still do use, but it's hard to make good things into a habit. Here's the 99 second version of what the diet entails (based on a 14 day jumpstart- things change a bit after two weeks, but not much: 1)eat two meals the same each day (like oatmeal every day, and a chicken salad everyday- you can switch up the dinners) 2)stay satisfied- eat throughout the day 3)inspect food labels 4)eat foods with fiber in the morning 5)eat healthy fats 6)drink 1-2 cups of water before meals 7)keep a log of how hungry you are on a scale of 1-7/try to stay within 3-4 8)stretch every day 9)walk 30 minutes every day 10)do cardio at least 3 days a week 11)strength train 20 minutes 2-3 times a week 12)get enough sleep 13)your waist size is more important than how much you weigh on the scale 14)get tested: blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and certain hormone levels 15)it's okay to make mistakes! The book goes into the nitty gritty details, like when reading food lables, what to watch for. You don't count calories, but try to be in tune with you body and to know when your body is satisfied, not stuffed. That's why they have you keep a food journal, but that was a bit time consuming for me. I do like that the book tells all about your body, and exactly what is happening physiologically with the food you eat, the hormones you have, and the reactions to all of this. I would recomend reading this just to get a better idea of the relationship of food to our bodies, and as I stated earlier, I did pick up some good habits that I still keep."}, {"userName": "Matt Burgess", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3282949-matt-burgess", "userReview": "You, On a Diet (2006), Mehmet C.

If anything this book is an incredible resource for those topics. I will admit the repeated exaggerated attention on unhealthy foods for comedic relief got old, but it didn't take away from understanding the digestive system and our body's response to specific foods and exercise.

I don\u2019t imagine anyone needs to know all of this in order to lose weight, but who knows which specific piece is going to be the one that makes it all fit for you or me? Fortunately, lots of diagrams and cartoons make it all more accessible. I loved learning that leptin, the hormone of satisfaction, increases as a result of a thirty minute walk. You might find the suggestion to increase small intestine fullness by eating seventy calories worth of nuts about twenty-five minutes before a meal to be invaluable.One of the reasons that I chose this book was a friend mentioned that the autopilot strategy really worked for her. The idea is to quit over-thinking food choices. Instead, eat roughly the same thing for all meals and snacks before supper. I was doing that to a degree before, but I worried about the opposite advice one sometimes gets about making sure there\u2019s variety in the diet. After reading this book, I\u2019m doing autopilot more and worrying less. After all, just because I eat a giant salad every day at lunch doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the exact same salad every day. I get plenty of variety and thinking about food less really helps!I loved the analogy of a Perfect Storm that they use in Chapter 10, making the case that losing weight in our current environment is hard because there are so many factors conspiring against us. It takes many strategies, not just will power, to survive that storm.The actual diet and activity plan looks doable, even fun, in its way.More on my blog: Book Review: YOU on a Diet by Michael Roizen and Mehmet Oz"}, {"userName": "Kelsey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4693185-kelsey", "userReview": "I've been reading this book for about a year, slowly picking away at it.

Now researchers are unraveling biological secrets about such things as why you crave chocolate or gorge at buffets or store so much fat.Michael Roizen and Mehmet Oz, America's most trusted doctor team and authors of the bestselling \"YOU\" series, are now translating this cutting-edge information to help you shave inches off your waist. They're going to do it by giving you the best weapon against fat: knowledge. By understanding how your body's fat-storing and fat-burning systems work, you're going to learn how to crack the code on true and lifelong waist management.Roizen and Oz will invigorate you with equal parts information, motivation, and change-your-life action to show you how your brain, stomach, hormones, muscles, heart, genetics, and stress levels all interact biologically to determine if your body is the size of a baseball bat or of a baseball stadium. In \"YOU: On a Diet,\" Roizen and Oz will redefine what a healthy figure is, then take you through an under-theskin tour of the organs that influence your body's size and its health. You'll even be convinced that the key number to fixate on is not your weight, but your waist size, which best indicates the medical risks of storing too much fat.Because the world has almost as many diet plans as it has e-mail spammers, you'd think that just about all of us would know everything there is to know about dieting, about fat, and about the reasons why our bellies have grown so large. \"YOU: On a Diet\" is much more than a diet plan or a series of instructions and guidelines or a faddish berries-only eating plan. It's a complete manual for waist management. It will show you how to achieve and maintain an ideal and healthy body size by providing a lexicon according to which any weight-loss system can be explained. \"YOU: On a Diet\" will serve as the operating system that facilitates future evolution in our dieting software.
