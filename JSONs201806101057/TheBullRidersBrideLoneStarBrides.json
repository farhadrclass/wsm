It can easily be picked up as a stand alone novel. The second story does flow along right after the first book and is focused on Dustin Starr and his lost love, Lindsey Lang.This was a sweet romance that left me with a happy feeling and excitement about the next book in the series. I really liked Dusty and Lindsey. These two were separated by tragedy, but never really stopped loving each other. It was fun to see them recognize that fact as the book progressed.Forgiveness of those who have wronged us was a wonderful theme of the story, and the characters also had to learn to trust God to help them overcome fear. Whether it was Lindsey\u2019s fear of being deserted by those she loved or Dusty\u2019s fear of what the future held for him after his injury, God was there. I enjoyed this addition to the series.I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.You can read this review on my blog at:https://brittreadsfiction.wordpress.c..."}, {"userName": "June", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9873203-june", "userReview": "When Dusty's brother caused the death of Lindsey's brother, both their lives fell apart.

This series is so very well connected, I had to look twice to believe that each book is written by a different author. Kudos to the three authors who were able to make this series flow like one continuous story.Vickie McDonough\u2019s The Bull Rider's Bride is the second of the Starr Brothers\u2019 stories. Right at the end of book one, Dusty is injured while competing. Now he is home healing from a serve leg injury and concussion, while also caring for his grandmother, now that Daniel has past that duty to him. This is a second chance romance but it is also a story of family, destroyed dreams, tragic loss, grace and forgiveness. Again, I love the clean cut rodeo cowboys in this series, it is refreshing. I really liked Lindsay\u2019s perspective on the changes that life brings when a dream is shattered just as Dusty\u2019s leg was. I even appreciate that while Lindsay\u2019s father cannot give true reasons for his actions Lindsay doesn\u2019t hold on to the hurt, I sure would have been tempted to do so. The author\u2019s look on God and life show clearly through Lindsay\u2019s words and actions. Throughout the first two books is a bit of mystery concerning the teenage actions of youngest brother, Luke. It was only hinted at in book one. In The Bull Rider's Bride, the consequence is revealed but it only served to pique my interest in hearing his story. I look forward to his story. 4.5 StarsThe publisher provided a copy for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29622094-cindy", "userReview": "Great second installment in the seriesThe wonderful second installment in the Lone Star Brides series, a trilogy written by a trio of authors, is Bull Rider\u2019s Bride by Vickie McDonough. Dusty Starr is recuperating at his grandma\u2019s home after being trampled by a rodeo bull. His grandma Shirley is recovering from a fall, and her home physical therapist is none other than Dusty\u2019s former girlfriend Lindsey Lang.This story was short but sweet. Lindsey and Dusty had been separated for six years following the death of her brother. Finding out how they reconciled, and even why they separated to begin with, kept the reader\u2019s interest. This portion in the Starr brothers series is an excellent middle segment, tying Daniel\u2019s story from book one and leading up to Luke\u2019s story in book three. Thus far, the individual authors of the series have collaborated well together. I look forward to finishing the series and would recommend this book to readers who enjoy a light-hearted story.I received a copy of this book through Serenade Books in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17217854-linda", "userReview": "The Bull Rider\u2019s Bride by Vickie McDonough is Book Two in The Lone Star Brides Series. Each book in the series is written by a different author, and each is stand-alone. Handsome cowboy Dustin \u2018Dusty\u2019 Starr\u2019s bull riding career ended abruptly when he drew the infamous Black Vortex. After his hospitalization he went home to recover at Pecan Ranch in Pecan, Texas, where he grew up with his brothers and was raised by his Gramma Shirley. His Gramma had taken a nasty fall and her new physical therapist is none other than Lindsey Lang, who\u2019d stolen his heart and then stomped on it. With bull riding the only thing Dusty knows how to do and Lindsey confused why Dusty just left without saying goodbye after her brother Sean died, will they find forgiveness, peace and a newfound faith? Will the same bull, Black Vortex, that ended Dusty\u2019s career play a part in securing his future? I love a romantic cowboy story and this book fits that description!

This is book 2 but you can read it without reading the first one. However, you should read the first one just because it's a fun story! This book focuses on the other twin, Dusty. He is very famous in the bull-riding circuit and has won a number of awards. However, he got injured badly and has to come back to his grandmother's to recuperate after surgery. He hates being down and not able to ride a horse or bulls. His grandmother loves having him home but she is also recuperating from an injury. Dusty is also dealing with being around his former girlfriend, Lindsey, who happens to be his grandmother's physical therapist! They had a great love but were torn apart by tragedy and now, being together in the same town again is hard. I always love reunion stories. I love to see how a couple can find love again. This story was very satisfying and I would highly recommend it! I also enjoyed the ending!"}, {"userName": "Margaret Tidwell", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7037554-margaret-tidwell", "userReview": "FTC: I received a free copy of this book from Serenade Books in exchange for my honest review. I received no other compensation and the opinions expressed in this review are one hundred percent true and my own.The Bull Rider\u2019s Bride by Vickie McDonough was a sweet story. I am a huge fan of these books because they are shorter, and I was able to get through the book pretty quick. These are my favorite characters in this series that I have read, and I wish that the book would have been a regular length because I was sad when it was over. This was a super sweet Christian romance and a book that anyone could read no matter what their age. I would recommend this book to anyone who love romance novels because it is a sweet story that anyone of any age can read."}, {"userName": "CARLA", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40832464-carla", "userReview": "This was a very cute book. I am not generally into spiritual romance books but this one did not over do it with the religion references. This was a well written book. I loved the storyline and the characters. Dusty is a typical bull rider. He is unsure of what he wants to do with the rest of his life after an accident keeps him from riding bulls any more. Lindsey is his grandmother's physical therapist...and his ex. The old flames still burn, but nothing worth having is easy. This is a wonderful love story. I can't wait to read the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Ausjenny", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1100486-ausjenny", "userReview": "This is the second book in the series. Dusty is Daniel's twin and has come home to recuperate and also look after Grandmother. Lindsey is his Grandmothers Occupational Therapist and also Dusty's former girlfriend. We learn more about what happened in the past to tear to close friends apart and if they can over come the issues. I enjoyed watching the game play out but did struggle with some medical timelines slightly but as the story evolved was able to get lost in it.
