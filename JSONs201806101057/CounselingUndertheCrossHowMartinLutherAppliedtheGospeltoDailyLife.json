He went from trying to earn God's approval through works to believing in the saving work of Christ. We may not be as familiar with how Luther then shared his insight with those who needed pastoral care and counseling.Kellemen has studied the works of Luther to understand how Luther counseled others. He uses quotes from letters and table talks to show how Luther applied the heart of the gospel to his flock. Kellemen also adds how we can then apply Luther's knowledge and method to our own lives.Here are a few of Luther's insights I really appreciated. Scripture is the only true comfort in distress and is sufficient for fighting temptations. Through Christ, we find redemption for deep internal problems. There is comfort in Christ alone. Luther had much to say about suffering. \u201cFor Luther, suffering is God's medicine of choice to awake us from our slumbering self-sufficiency and turn us to heightened Christ-sufficiency.\u201d (Loc 1278/5729) \u201c...God sends suffering to cure our deepest sickness of estrangement from God caused by our independence of him.\u201d (Loc 2060/5729)This book is a good reminder for pastors and counselors today to return to the gospel as essential in pastoral care and counseling. Sin must be taken seriously. Spiritual warfare must be practiced against the devil. We must be reunited with Christ in relationship and then shown how to reinterpret life through the lens of the cross. We must be continually reminded of the gospel in the face of our gospel amnesia.This book may be a little too scholarly for the average Christian. While Kellemen does frequently tell us what the previous information means to applying it to our lives, that previous information includes lots of material more suited to professionals than laypeople. It was no surprise that this book began as his PhD dissertation. While recently rewritten, the book still has an academic flavor to it.I received a complimentary egalley of this book through Litfuse.

That counselor was a lifeline of Jesus to my soul. I saw Jesus in him and his relationship with Jesus drew me like a moth to a flame.\u00a0 So much of who I am now and the path I'm following is a very direct result of his influence on my life. He showed me a different way to live, a different life and I am so thankful for his careful care and concern. He is one of the very precious Jesus grace-gifts of my life.\u00a0As a direct result of his influence in my life, I wanted to be just like him when I grew up. I wanted to be a Christian counselor, I have wanted to help others the way he helped me. I want to point others to Jesus, to be a beacon of light in someone else's darkness. I have wanted to be used to draw others to the flame of Jesus until they can, like I do, dance in His Holy Fire.\u00a0Because of all this, I am still drawn to books about counseling or by counselors. When I find a book by a counselor on the topic of being a better counselor I am giddy. You can imagine my immense giddiness when I received an email from Litfuse about Dr. Bob Kellemen's book, Counseling Under the Cross: How Martin Luther applied the Gospel to daily Living.\u00a0 I didn't hesitate, I didn't think twice, I immediately clicked \"Review This book\".\u00a0In Counseling Under the Cross, Kellemen teaches counselors to counsel the way Martin Luther counseled..under the cross and with the full gospel. Kellemen has divided the book into two sections. The first section is to get us acquainted with Martin Luther before Jesus gripped his heart. He lived in constant fear of the anger and wrath of God. He would spend hours confessing every known sin in his life. Martin Luther saw God, not as a good Father, but as a righteous and vindictive Judge.\u00a0And that is where chapter one ends. And where chapter two begins. Martin Luther went through a metamorphosis of ginormous proportions. He moved from seeing God only as wrathful to seeing God as his loving and kind Father.\u00a0This transformation not only changed Luther's relationship with Jesus, it changed how he related to Jesus and to those people under his care.\u00a0 His new freedom in Jesus drove him to share it with others.\u00a0Chapters 3-11 talk about how Martin used his freedom in Jesus to minister to others.\u00a0 He used a cross-shaped method of counseling:Sustaining,Healing,\u00a0Reconciling, andGuidingKellemen shares Luther's theology and methodology of each one. He shares through letters Martin wrote to those he was helping, his table talks, and other writings.\u00a0 Kellemen writes in such a way the reader really sees the heart of Martin Luther for all believer, but especially those who were hurting.\u00a0This book should be on the Must-Read list of every Christian counselor and/or pastor, as well anyone who has a heart to bring health and healing to the hurting in Jesus.\u00a0What did I like about the book? In short, everything. Bob Kellemen wrote in a manner that drew me in deeper with every page. I had to read it with a highlighter in my hand because there is just so much good!\u00a0Bob Kellemen also wrote in a way that opened my eyes to circumstances I've experienced personally. I had many personal a-ha moments. So while this book is written for those in the role of counselor, anyone could read it and benefit greatly.\u00a0What didn't I like about the book? From the introduction when Kellemen would quote someone, he only used their last name. I know this is nit-picky of me, but I would rather have the author's full name at least the first time he is cited.\u00a0I also wish he had capitalized pronouns referring to Jesus.\u00a0A few of my favorite quotes:When life stinks, our perspective shrinks.When the devil casts up to us our sin, and declares us worthy of death and hell, we must say, \"I confess I am worthy of death and hell. What more have you to say?\" \"Then you will be lost forever!\" \"Not in the least: for I know One who suffered for me and made satisfaction for my sins and His Name is Jesus Christ, the Son of God. So long as He shall live, I shall live also.\"The Spirit empowers us to live out who we already are in Christ.Faith activates love.You who are so pugnacious in everything else, fight against yourself!I give this book 10 out of 5 turning pages. Yes! It is that good!I received a free copy of this book from Litfuse for the purpose of review.

The effects of this movement are still felt today. Through the work of the Holy Spirit and the faithfulness of the reformers, this period recovered many biblical ideals that were lost in the preceding centuries. Among these were the authority of Scripture, salvation by faith alone, the preisthood of all believers, and the need for local pastoral ministry. In his new book Counseling Under the Cross: How Martin Luther Applied the Gospel to Daily Life (New Growth Press, 2017) Dr. Bob Kelleman discusses the pastoral ministry, particularly pastoral counseling, modeled by Martin Luther. This aspect of pastoral ministry was neglected during Luther's time, and is an important part of ministry in the church today. Pastoral ministry in general and pastoral counseling in particular was largely non-existent during the Middle Ages. Pastoral engagement with parishioners was reduced to the admistering of the sacraments. However, early in the sixteenth century reformers such as Martin Luther rediscovered the need for pastoral ministry that extended beyond the sacraments. As the Protestant movement broke away from the established Catholic Church, an emphasis on the local church began to take precendent. This meant that the needs of parishioners were dealt with in a more personal way within the context of congregations. Particularly, pastoral counseling became an important aspect of local church ministry. In Counseling Under the Cross Dr. Kelleman constructs Luther's practical theology of pastoral counseling by relying on original sources, such as personal letters, Luther's books/published writings, and the personal accounts of others as recorded in Table Talk. He discusses two basic aspects of Luther's ministry (1) what shaped his pastoral counseling, and (2) the shape of Luther's pastoral counseling.First, what shaped Luther's pastoral counseling was his own experience with God's grace. Luther grew up believing that God was vindictive and was extremely afraid of His wrath. He was ever aware of his own shortcomings and the realization that he could never measure up to God's standard. He saw this as a curse against him. However, while studying the book of Romans, Luther discovered that the wrath of God had been poured out on Jesus through the work of the cross. This meant that salvation was not earned through participating in the sacraments, but freely given by God's grace. Luther then began to live his life in light of the cross and allowed it to shape every aspect of his life, including his pastoral ministry. Second, the shape of Luther's pastoral counseling was extremely personal and biblically focused. He counseled and exhorted his friends, family, and parshionhers through the lens of the cross realizing that there are four basic aspects of pastoral counseling, sustaining and healing (parakaletic counseling) and reconciling and guiding (nouthetic counseling). Luther saw his pastoral role as a physician for souls, pointing them to the only source for true healing namely the cross. Dr. Kelleman discusses both Luther's theology and methodology for each of these four aspects, providing a model for pastoral counseling that can be applied to the local church today. Counseling Under the Cross is a practically helpful resource for pastors, as well as lay and professional Christian counselors. This resource would also make a great supplemental reading for course work in a Christian counseling degree program. I would reccomend this resource with one disclaimer by reminding the reader that the scope of Dr. Kelleman's book is pastoral counseling. In some cases parishioners may need more extensive counseling or psychological help requiring professional/clinical resources. However, the book adds great value to the field of pastoral counseling and its implementation into the life of the local church. Dr. Kelleman stands firmly on the biblical precedent as recovered by Martin Luther during the sixteenth century. I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review of the book. It is available for purchase at all major book retailers."}, {"userName": "Isaac Butterworth", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19707788-isaac-butterworth", "userReview": "Bob Kellemen's book, Counseling Under the Cross, is not just for counselors. I recommend it to anyone who wants to grow in their own faith or to help others grow in theirs. The book is laid out very nicely. Using Martin Luther's well-documented practice of soul care, Kellemen addresses the two major kinds of evils we face: the evil we suffer and the evil we promote. The former (suffering) calls for parakaletic biblical counseling (the term parakaletic deriving from the Greek New Testament term for \"comforter\"). The latter (sin) calls for nouthetic biblical counseling (the term nouthetic deriving from the Greek New Testament term for \"admonishing\"). Parakaletic counseling is founded on the affirmation that \"God is good even when life is bad,\" while nouthetic counseling has its foundation in the affirmation that \"God is gracious even when I am sinful.\"With regard to the suffering we endure, Kellemen draws from Luther's pastoral practice two strategies for comforting the sufferer: sustaining and healing. In sustaining the other, we empathize with them and point them, first of all, to the Christ who suffers with them and, then, to the body of Christ (the church) to find encouragement.The ministry of healing, according to Kellemen (inspired by Luther's practice), is grounded in an understanding of suffering as opportunity to grow toward spiritual maturity. What can't be cured can help us mature. The methodology of parakaletic counseling is directed toward healing the soul by focusing on the Christian's union with Christ, healing the mind by helping sufferers reinterpret their suffering so that they can discern the divine purpose in it, and healing the will by affirming faith and confronting any lack of faith.With regard to the sin we commit, Kellemen draws from Luther's pastoral practice two strategies for recovering the sinner: reconciling and guiding. In reconciling, the focus is on the conscience. There are, broadly speaking, two kinds of sinners: the penitent and the impenitent. Kellemen works primarily with the penitent sinner, urging grace for the comfort of the conscience.Guiding is the second strategy for counseling those who are struggling with sin. Taking his cue from Luther, Kellemen establishes the goal of guiding as fostering \"faith active in love.\" Faith in Christ comes first, but its effect is to produce love for others--especially in the home, the workplace, the community, and the church.Kellemen concludes his book with a short chapter encouraging the reader to consider how she or he will apply what has been learned. It would be tempting not to take the time or make the effort to consider the \"so what\" of the book, but it would render the book less helpful. The book has helped me to gain a clearer picture of what I am to do in two specific areas: (1) when I teach and (2) when I seek to care for others. Kellemen has helped to see that my teaching may be more practical if I will consider what the needs of my students are. Do some of them suffer from the evil done to them? How then can I sustain them on the one hand and help them find healing on the other? I have some tools now to help me do those things. Are others that I teach struggling with sins they have committed? If so, I can now see the two strategies called for: reconciling and guiding. And Kellemen has equipped me to take some practical steps in reaching out to them. It can work the same way with people for whom I want to be a caring presence. Kellemen has given me some diagnostic methods and some treatment strategies that I can apply. This, as you can imagine, is very helpful.It has even occurred to me that I can use Kellemen's matrix to study any given passage of Scripture. I can do this simply by asking, What is the core issue in this passage? Does the gospel intent of this portion of Scripture function to sustain, to heal, to reconcile, or to guide?I encourage you, whoever you are, to read this book. You will learn a lot about Luther, but you will also learn a lot about life!"}, {"userName": "David Steele", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12195496-david-steele", "userReview": "One man blazed a trail in the sixteenth century that laid the groundwork for countless numbers of Christians. Martin Luther was the primary agent who God used in a mighty way as he hammered his 95 theses on the castle door at Wittenberg on October 31, 1517. He unleashed a theological revolution known as the Protestant Reformation, where the doctrines of grace were recovered and the gospel began to exert a powerful influence in the lives of people.Counseling Under the Cross by Bob Kellemen explores the life and legacy of Martin Luther and reveals how his theological framework influenced his counseling ministry.What Shaped Martin Luther\u2019s Pastoral Counseling?Part one explores Luther\u2019s background and alerts readers to the oppressive environment that was so common in the sixteenth century. Luther fought desperately to find peace with God but was doomed to failure apart from completed work of Christ which is received by grace alone through faith alone.Kellemen explains how Luther\u2019s anxiety impacted his life in his early adult years. Luther admits, \u201cFor I had hoped I might find peace of conscience with fasts, prayers, and the vigils with which I miserably afflicted my body, but the more I sweated it out like this, the less peace and tranquillity I knew.\u201dThe author continues, \u201cBefore he came under the influence of the cross, Luther lived life as a man terrified that he would never find peace with God because his God was not a God of peace. Luther lived with a constant sense of guilt and dread in the face of a terrifying, angry, and unforgiving God.\u201dThe only way Luther found relief is by casting all his hope and future on a sovereign God, by grace alone through faith alone. Kellemen writes, \u201cThe Christ of the cross transformed Luther the man terrified before God into Luther the man at peace with God.\u201d This newly converted man now saw God in a different light which not only radically affected his life; it altered his ministry at every level.What is the Shape of Martin Luther\u2019s Pastoral Counseling?\u201cLuther\u2019s counseling reflects his theology - it is cross-shaped and gospel-centered.\u201d Part two reveals the shape of Luther\u2019s pastoral counseling. The author examines Luther\u2019s approach to pastoral counseling by exploring two primary angles.First, soul care: comfort for suffering.Luther\u2019s theology and methodology of sustaining and healing are presented with specific examples of how the Reformer encouraged and edified the saints.Second, spiritual direction: confrontation for sinning.Specifically, Luther\u2019s theology and methodology of reconciling and guiding are presented here. Again, the author paints a pastoral portrait of Luther and shows him at work among the Body of Christ. While soul care (noted above) involves comforting and encourages Christians, spiritual direction involves a confrontation with people. Kellemen adds, \u201cIn reconciling soul care, we seek to startle one another with the gospel.\u201d Such a nouthetic approach is mandated in Scripture (Col. 1:28) and plays a vital role in biblical counseling.EVALUATIONCounseling Under the Cross is a treasure chest of gospel nuggets. Bob Kellemen does a beautiful job of explaining how Martin Luther applied the gospel to everyday life. One of the most helpful aspects of the book is the emphasis on indicatives and imperatives. The author makes it clear that both are important aspects of the Christian life: \u201cSalvation in Christ (gospel indicatives) frees, empowers, and motivates us through faith to serve others in love (gospel imperatives). Progressive sanctification is faith active in love - exercising the love that comes from faith in the grace of Christ.\u201dI strongly urge pastors, counselors, and church leaders to prayerfully study Counseling Under the Cross. Additionally, I urge readers to pick up a copy of my recent book, Bold Reformer: Celebrating the Gospel-Centered Convictions of Martin Luther, as a companion volume to Bob Kellemen\u2019s excellent work.I received this book free from the publisher.

In Counseling Under the Cross, Bob Kellemen introduces us to Martin Luther and shows us how he learned to apply the Gospel to daily life. Initially, \"Luther had attempted to care for his soul through his own wisdom and it earned him nothing but despair. Only as Luther clung to the sufficiency of Christ and Scripture did he find peace for his troubled soul\" (pg. 25). Kellemen relates how God used His people and His Word to open Luther's eyes to the Christ of the cross, transforming him into a man whom God would use to minister His Word to others.If you have read any of Bob Kellemen's works, then you likely know of the significant influence that Luther has had on him and will recognize the lens through which he views Luther's counseling. Through Luther's writings, Kellemen illustrates his four biblical compass points to speak gospel truth in love, what Kellemen refers to as \"gospel conversations,\" compass points which Kellemen would contend were derived directly from Luther's works. In a fresh way, Counseling Under the Cross demonstrates that:\u201cChanged lives occur as we apply Christ\u2019s changeless truth to help suffering people know that it\u2019s normal to hurt (sustaining) and possible to hope (healing), and as we help sinning people to know that it\u2019s horrible to sin but wonderful to be forgiven (reconciling), and supernatural to mature (guiding)\u201d (Robert Kellemen, Equipping Counselors for Your Church, pg. 65).According to Kellemen, \"...Luther's counseling followed the historic focus of pastoral soul care and spiritual direction...[that] dealt with the evils we have suffered in a fallen world and with the sins we have committed\" (pg. 40). This pastoral concern of Luther's became the spark that ignited the Reformation making this work a timely gift in light of the upcoming 500th Anniversary of the Reformation. Kellemen demonstrates how the: \"'Sufficiency of Scripture' is the heartbeat of the Reformation. God's Word is sufficient, authoritative, and profoundly relevant for all of life and all of ministry\" (pg. 221).Counseling Under the Cross is well-documented and includes many quotes from Luther's letters, sermons, table talks, and other writings. While at times, Kellemen's terminology may seem cumbersome, his message is faithful to God's Word, centered on the Gospel, and provides useful categories for ministering the Word to others. Each chapter concludes with a \"tweet-sized\" summary for review, and the entire book wraps up with a call to make application from what we've learned. Kellemen shows how he has spent that last two decades of his ministry standing on the shoulders of a faithful brother who has gone before us. The thoughtfully selected quotes in Counseling Under the Cross are like flowers plucked out of books that will likely lead many readers to the garden of Luther's works in the future.** May we all continue to minister the Word to our brothers and sisters who are suffering, fighting sin, and seeking to grow in holiness, standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before us just as Dr. Kellemen has done with Luther.If you'd like a taste of the content that you can expect to find in the book, Dr. Kellemen has put together an edifying PowerPoint presentation which is available on his website.*Many thanks to New Growth Press and Litfuse Publicity Group for providing me with a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review!**(Many thanks to Aimee Byrd for introducing me to Hannah More's excellent analogy through her book, \"No Little Women\".

Most people (me included) know Martin Luther as the champion of the Reformation and theologian but probably not so much as a pastoral counselor. Counseling Under the Cross is a thorough, well-researched case study on how Martin Luther applied the gospel of Christ's grace to daily life, to suffering, sin, and sanctification. The book is divided into two sections: I. What Shaped Martin Luther's Pastoral Counseling? and II. What Is the Shape of Martin Luther's Pastoral Counseling? In the first section, Bob Kellemen, helps readers understand the background of Martin Luther's faith journey which shaped Luther's life and ministry. Luther severely suffered soul anguish and eventually realized that his own works of righteousness only led to hopelessness, despair, and uncertainties. He discovered that man-made remedy is futile and impossible. Once he saw and embraced the light of God's infinite grace, he experienced joyful, sweet, soul-freeing peace and comfort. His view of God changed from an angry Judge to a loving Father. Luther wanted to help others experience the same so he shared with others what he found helpful to him. \"Justification/reconciliation by grace through faith was the core of Luther's pastoral care--not only for salvation--but for daily Christian living.\" (p.26) Luther drew people back to the Cross of Christ by weaving God's Word and grace in his counseling ministry. I really admire how Luther personally cared for people's soul with compassion and tenderness yet at the same time with strong conviction and straightforward admonition. He cared not only about people's external suffering (diseases and misfortunes) but also their internal suffering (distresses and doubts). \"For Luther, we must look at everything in life, including our suffering, through the lens of Christ's gospel victory narrative.\" (p. 68)In the second section, the author explains how Luther approached the four areas of pastoral care: sustaining, healing, reconciling, and guiding. Luther's personal experiences of deep spiritual quest and soul torment enabled him to empathize with others who suffered. Luther showed how gospel truth transformed and freed soul sufferers. He believed in the sufficiency of Scripture and of God's grace for all our trials and sufferings. This book is filled with Luther's personal accounts, excerpts from his books and letters, and quotes from many who wrote about Luther. At the end of each chapter, you will find a tweet-size summary of the main message from that chapter. There are so many valuable lessons and practical applications we can glean from Luther's loving, insightful, hope-giving words of wisdom and ways of counseling. Counseling Under the Cross is a great resource for pastors, Christian counselors, and anyone who wants to offer Christ-centered, gospel-saturated, grace-based counseling to those who need to hear (including ourselves).~I received a free copy of this book from Litfuse Publicity Group in exchange for my honest review.

After many failed attempts at gaining favor with God by works, Luther finally realized the truth of salvation through Christ alone by faith alone through grace alone. He then spent the rest of his life helping others to come to the same saving realization. He nailed his 95 Theses to the church door in Wittenberg because he had a tremendous pastoral concern that people were being led away from grace/faith and led toward works as the means for peace with God.Luther lived his early life with a terrified conscience, sure that there was nothing he could do to merit God's salvation. He was tormented by the devil, by his sin, and by his deep and abiding sense of unworthiness. He came to realize that healing and salvation might only be found in trusting God, and in that trust Luther found his anxieties melt away.That's why I think Kellemen is onto something: To understand Luther's preaching and theology, look first to Luther's care as a pastor. That's an important realization for contemporary pastors: Don't neglect the care of the people in favor of the weightier things like posting theology on Facebook and think that's counsel.______________________I received a free copy of this book as part of the LitFuse blogging tour in exchange for my honest review here."}, {"userName": "Gayle Pace", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13488728-gayle-pace", "userReview": "WHAT I THINK! This book gives information about the teachings of Martin Luther's theology. IT shows us that we need to go back to the basic Bible teachings to help the troublings of our soul, heart and minds. Martin Luther had a love for everyone, since everyone is a child of God. The book gives some of Martin Luther's quote and stories where it shows that as children of God we need to place God in the midst of all we do. The book is not only for teachers of the gospel but for everyone. It gives an insight into the aspect of love. We need to think about others and less about self. When you lend a helping hand to others you reap so much more for yourself. People today need to go back to the basic principles of the scripture. Everyone's soul needs tending and to do so, we need to stand one with the cross. Mr. Kellemen wrote this book, with extensive research to help us understand the Reformer's basic message.

The book itself is a blend of the life of Luther & provides a historical account of the man himself. It then looks at him in a more personal way, showing the what/how/why he utilized the Bible and its truths to make the Bible the key resource in counseling others. I enjoyed both the history as well as the applicable insight that is still quite relevant today.*I received a copy of this book from the publisher, but was under no obligation to write a review.

Not that counseling is bad, but when you have done it for it can be tiring. I really enjoyed my conseler from my church. They really showed me how to cling to Jesus through the tought times. It was a lifeline to heaven. I saw how God was working in his life and really was despreate for a relationship like that. This has shaped my life in so many ways. I am vary thankful for this wonderful counseling care I recieved. I am currently a student studying psychology, so I end up reading alot of books surronding counseling, some christain and many secular. Whne I saw this book I knew I wanted to review it. I will be honest before this book, I wasn't super knowledgable about Martin Luthers application of the Gospel to daily living. In Counseling Under the Cross, Kellemen teaches counselors to counsel the way Martin Luther counseled. Which was with the full gospel and directly under the cross. I thought this book was quite interesting in the way it was formated. It was divided into two sections. The first was information about Martin Luther before Jesus. He was struggling with fear, anxiety, and anger. His life was full of chaos, in lived in constant fear of the wrath of God. He would spend hours confessing every little misbehavior, any impure thoughts, any sin he could think of. He saw God as a vindictive judge, rather the Father. The second section begins with Luthers metamporphisis of character and faith. He moved into a place where he saw God as loving and Kind, rather than rightous and wrathful. This transformation changed how he related and treated those under his care. With his kinder relationship with Jesus, he was more kind and compassionate with outhers. I enjoyed reading about how he ministered to other. I enjoyed the Cross shaped method of counseling: SustainingHealingReconcilingGuidingThis book should be read by every Christain conseuler, and paster working today. Even thoughs of different theologies could benifet from some of the teachings of this book. This is a book I think everyone should check out.

In Counseling Under the Cross, biblical counselor and noted author Bob Kellemen explains how Martin Luther s gospel-centered and cross-focused pastoral care transformed his own approach to soul care. As Kellemen mines Luther s own writings and other first hand accounts, readers will gain a new understanding of how Luther richly, relevantly, robustly, and relationally applied the gospel to suffering, sin, sanctification, and our search for peace with God. Counseling Under the Cross will guide pastors, counselors, lay leaders, and friends toward a rich understanding of the gospel that will directly impact their personal ministry to others. Through lively vignettes, real-life stories, and direct quotes from Luther, readers will be equipped to apply the gospel to themselves and others so together they find their hope and help in Christ alone.", "title": "Counseling Under the Cross: How Martin Luther Applied the Gospel to Daily Life", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35442727-counseling-under-the-cross", "average": 4.17, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1505009227l/35442727.jpg", "reviews": 17, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1049508.Robert_W_Kellemen", "name": "Robert W.
