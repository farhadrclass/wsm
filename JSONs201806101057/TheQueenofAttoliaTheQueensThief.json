You see, The Thief is a wonderful little book filled with excellent writing, an interesting protagonist, an exciting fantasy world and a great big twist near the end. The Queen of Attolia had all of this, but it just had more of everything. It was everything I loved about the first book... on steroids.Every character and every sentence - damn it, every word even! - is important, serves it's own purpose and is never wasted. This is a characteristic in books that is rare but oh so wonderful when you manage to find it.Being told in 3rd person, unlike book one which was from Eugenides POV, allows the reader to see the bigger picture and to better understand the world that forms the backdrop of this series and the political relationships between Attolia, Eddis and Sounis. But, oddly, at the same time I felt like we also got to know Eugenides far better than in The Thief, and I loved him all the more in this second installment. He's such a perfectly imperfect character, he's flawed, he's brave without being ridiculously self-sacrificing, he's a little devil and yet you can't do anything but be on his side. Whatever happens to him in the next book has suddenly become very important to me.And it's not just Eugenides... I mean, how easy would it have been for the author to make the Queen of Attolia nothing more than a villain sat on a foreign throne? But that's not the story Megan Whalen Turner is trying to tell. Like I said, Turner doesn't waste characters and her use of 3rd person in this novel lets us readers see the real queen behind that stone mask of cruelty. Of all the qualities I like characters to have, complexity is quite possibly my favourite.But I think the book was really sold to me when Turner managed to successfully pull off a romance that surprised me, pleased me and just generally worked without being soppy or cheesy. A young adult novel with romance that doesn't make me cringe?

I am not very good at writing positive reviews, so this will probably sound cheesy, but I totally loved every word, every sentence of this story!\"The Queen of Attolia\" is a second book in Megan Whalen Turner's series about the Thief of Eddis Eugenides. I moderately liked the first book, mostly for its conciseness and intricate world-building rooted in Greek history and mythology, but this second book exceeded any kind of expectations I had had. It is just so much better than \"The Thief\" written from Eugenide's 1st person POV. \"The Queen of Attolia\" is written in 3rd person which allows us to understand the workings of minds of all major players - King of Sounis, Queens of Attolia and Eddis, magus, etc. The story starts when Eugenides is caught by Attolian guard. The Queen of Attolia executes her revenge on the Thief, and in a way that almost breaks Gen. Queen of Eddis, enraged by her Thief's plight, embarks on a war with Attolia, and Sounis starts his attack on both neighboring countries in an attempt to unite the territory against the outside threat of Mede. What follows is a complex story of politics, diplomacy, military strategies and intrigue. I am not lying when I say I loved every word of this book. Because every word of it is important, there is no fluff or filler, every sentence matters. That is probably why it took me 3 days to finish this 300-page book, I simply didn't want to miss anything!But there is more. I really loved the character developments in this book. Just like in \"The Thief,\" we never fully know the narrators. In many ways, they remain anonymous to us, but whatever is revealed, is layered and complex. I enjoyed following Eugenides' transformation from a snarky selfish boy into a strong man. And let me tell you, the romance in this book totally catches you off-guard and certainly pushes boundaries.I can't wait to read the next book - \"The King of Attolia\" and see where Turner takes her characters next. Why, of why does it take her on average 5 years to write each book?"}, {"userName": "\u2744\ufe0fNani\u2744\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68538597-nani", "userReview": "Long overdue for a reread. Gen, my one and only, we meet again. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I want to climb on the highest rooftop and scream at the top of my lungs - I LOVE THIS MAGNIFICENT SERIES WITH EVERY FIBRE OF MY\u00a0BEING! but I feel even that won't\u00a0do my feelings\u2014and this series\u2014justice.Give me a fantasy/fantasy-esque book with heavy political intrigue and you\u2019ve got my undivided attention.\u00a0Reading a novel filled with court intrigue, heavy conflicts - more behind the scenes conniving and pulling strings than actual battles, complicated stories full of clever manoeuvres and characters Is. My. Jam! I could never get enough. And given the somewhat slowness of its predecessor, I was not prepared for the magnificent surprise that was The Queen of Attolia. Wow!I felt almost every emotion while reading this.\u00a0Anger, hate, love, sadness, rage (so much rage) and oh the confusion! Before I even got to page 50 my jaw was wide open with shock and amazement.\u00a0The more I thought I knew the less I actually knew anything when the whole plot took a completely different direction than I\u2019d expected.\u00a0And the characters! I truly didn\u2019t know what to make of them.\u00a0Let\u2019s start with The Queen of Attolia - okay, wow. Throughout the book I hated her. I admired her. I was enraged by\u00a0her. I freaking loved her and by the end, I was simply in awe of her.Eugenides. What the actual hell. Alright, before I move on,\u00a0let me preface this by saying, the next book in the series The King of Attolia, put\u00a0Eugenides on the number\u00a0two spot of my top five favourite\u00a0male characters in fantasy. Ever.\u00a0What a character. What. A. Character!Now, onto the topic at hand, I have never been so damned confused by a character (Confusion, as you can see, is the theme of this review). He was nothing\u00a0like I\u2019d expected! Especially when compared to the Eugenides of book one, The Thief. It was almost like they were two different people. In a good and a bad way. One thing I did love was that he was not the all-perfect, all-brave, badass protagonist we\u2019re used to seeing who could simply do no wrong or whom no one could best. In fact, he rarely got things right, in this book at least. I was happy to see him humanised and humbled by some extremely disturbing, albeit significant events. He did mess up, got bested at times and he was also painfully vulnerable and weak when the situation demanded it. However, he was also amazingly clever when he needed to be. I love him. I can't say it enough.The plot was amazing and every chapter gripped my attention from start to finish and nothing dragged, nor was there ever a single boring moment.\u00a0Why some books have to end, I will never, in my life, understand."}, {"userName": "Alienor \u2718 French Frowner \u2718", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31461418-alienor-french-frowner", "userReview": "[\"Bending over Eugenides, she grabbed his head by the hair above his forehead and twisted.

Attolia raised her chin to meet the look that her seneschal had said would melt lead. Eddis opened her mouth, but before she could put her thoughts into words, Eugenides laughed. Laughing, he dropped his head onto the bed; then he looked up to grin at Attolia.She looked back at him, and her cheeks flushed.

Eddis took not of the expression, amused to have found at last, she was certain, the original of the look Eugenides had copied. She smiled. Attolia hesitated, then smiled herself, very briefly.

This is the great but hard-hitting sequel to The Thief. It's a wonderful, ancient Greece-flavored fantasy series. The gods care, in a remote way, but they can be cruel. My highest recommendation for this series!Review originally posted at www.fantasyliterature.com:Megan Whalen Turner\u2019s The Queen of Attolia, the second book in her QUEEN\u2019S THIEF fantasy series, begins much the same as The Thief, the first book in this series: Eugenides (Gen) the thief is in prison. This time it is the Attolians who have captured him, but he\u2019s made them, especially their queen, even more angry than he had the kingdom of Sounis in the first volume. From this similar beginning, however, the plot veers in some completely unexpected directions. Whalen Turner explained this in a Publisher\u2019s Weekly interview:I could have written a whole series about fun, cool, exciting things Gen could get away with, but they would all be leading up to a point where he did something he didn\u2019t get away with. The next significant thing that was going to happen to Gen would be when he got caught. It was inevitable. So I started Queen there. I knew some people would be upset but I trusted they would also see it had to happen eventually. To write something else would be a kind of lying to ourselves.It\u2019s difficult to say much more without spoiling the story. This book, even more than most, is one that should be read without being spoiled. The first part of The Queen of Attolia is heart-wrenching and difficult reading, however. The first time I attempted to read it, about a dozen years ago, I foundered on the rocky part of the plot and didn\u2019t finish it. However, after reading the third book in this series, The King of Attolia, and falling in love with the characters all over again, I came back to The Queen of Attolia to give it a second try, about five years ago. I made it through the book that time and rated it three stars; I was still much more enthused about the other two books in the series than this volume.However, on this read, my third try, I\u2019m rating it a strong four stars. Rereading the entire series, it has become more apparent how cleverly Whalen Turner has plotted this book, how well the books\u2019 plots interlock with each other, and how brilliant and devious her characters are. Small nuances in the plot can carry significance. Each main character has layers and hidden depths. They can be charming and maddening, sympathetic and brutal, all at the same time. And the ancient Greece type of world, with gods and goddesses that are real and intervene occasionally in the lives of mortals, is fascinating:\u201cStop whining,\u201d Eugenides said.\u201cWhat?\u201d Eddis\u2019s expression shifted from wary to puzzled.\u201cThat was the message. For me, alone among mortals, the gods send their messenger to tell me to stop whining. That\u2019ll teach me to go hide in a temple.\u201dFor a young adult fantasy, The Queen of Attolia has a surprising amount of complexity and depth. Due to the painful and disturbing content in some parts of the book, I don\u2019t recommend this for middle grade readers, but the rewards for more mature readers are great.2 3 4 enthusiastic stars. If I ever read it again it'll probably jump to 5!"}, {"userName": "Elise (TheBookishActress)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52545435-elise-thebookishactress", "userReview": "I love how this one plays around with point of view, showing us both Eugenides\u2019 views on Attolia and Attolia\u2019s view on Eugenides: it\u2019s an excellent view into both of their characters. While I think Whalen Turner occasionally relies too much on not letting you into the head of a character so she can execute a plot twist, we still get an excellent look into these characters, a view that feels dimensional if perhaps not full. The other thing I liked about this book is something I knew I would \u2014 \npolitical intrigue.\n Whalen Turner does such a grand job with the power moves, the wars, the intrigue of it all. This one is narratively all over the place, but it is made to work. It feels like a wide story rather than an incoherent one. The plot twists and plot reveals are consistently interesting and often surprising. I also love that the two lead female characters we get in this book are both such powerhouses. And hey, maybe it\u2019s time to talk about badass girls \u2014 Attolia and Eddis both make for such excellent political leaders, each in their own way. This book may be led by Eugenides, but I think it\u2019s more about Attolia and Eddis and the power in \ndifferent kinds of strength.\n Attolia has lost sight of that in her own power, her own life of ruthlessness. The Queen of Attolia is basically \na takedown of the idea of petty competition between women\n and the idea that there\u2019s only one way to be strong for a queen; Attolia and Eddis contrast so wonderfully. And let\u2019s talk about Attolia\u2019s character in general! She is such a good antivillain. We start out with her as a complete and total villain, and end with her as a very well humanized antihero. Her redemption arc \u2014 or, to be more specific, reframing arc \u2014 is the best part of this book, and absolutely worth reading for. I mean, I like Eugenides too. He's a delight. But mostly I\u2019d die for her. Something I did think was missing for me was my investment in the first half of the book; we\u2019re basically thrown into a political situation we only got a glimpse of in book one, and it\u2019s difficult to really get invested in the world and the characters. I also think a few of the plot twists are kind of easy to guess and the time between them too extended. I wished for less lagging between the big moments and big twists. But I would overall give this a positive rating. It kept me invested and I so want to continue with my journey through this world.

He really does deserve his own story.Original Review:When I finished reading The Thief, I expressed some hope that the next books in the series would have a faster pace. Well, this is me eating those words. As far as I\u2019m concerned, she can be as slow as she wants! The Queen of Attolia is a book to be savored. It is beautiful and rich, with complex, suffering, gorgeous characters that I just want to spend all day with. It is also packs quite an emotional punch.In this book, we finally get to spend time with the real Eugenides. No more false obnoxiousness and bad manners. Don\u2019t worry though, he still has that inner spark of cunning. As the book begins, he is captured by the icy Queen of Attolia, who initially orders his execution but then decides to do something even more damaging. The collision between Eugenides and Attolia sets into motion the breakdown of the fragile relationships between the three neighboring countries of Sounis, Eddis, and Attolia. As the nations start warring, the Medeans stand poised to insert their control.This book has all the great elements of a twisty political intrigue, but I think that at its heart it\u2019s all about the internal battles of the characters. It\u2019s about the devastation that comes when one\u2019s identity is lost, and one must start anew. It\u2019s about the struggle to hold on to the tiny bit of goodness inside, when the world demands so much ruthlessness. It\u2019s about managing to hold on to faith and trust and grace when the whole world seems to be turning its back.It was so completely refreshing to read a romance not based on sappy, goofy, kind, caring love. Megan Whalen Turner presents an honest and challenging kind of love. There is an understanding here that sometimes relationships are built not on easy, careful acquaintance, but by collision, confrontation, and shared tragedy. It is definitely the title character, The Queen of Attolia, whose struggle affects me the most. I love her cold, quiet, powerful control combined with her inner fragility. I love how her history was revealed in little glimpses that made me more and more sympathetic to her. Reading this book actually makes me like the first book more, because I know so much more of the backstory.Now on to book three\u2026."}, {"userName": "Bibi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33411728-bibi", "userReview": "Love, love this book- and series, it helps that Ms Turner wrote one of the best (and adorable) male leads ever."}, {"userName": "Limonessa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4147373-limonessa", "userReview": "I elected Froi as my favorite male character of the year for 2011, but Eugenides definitely gets second place. The Queen of Attolia is the second book in The Queen's Thief series by Megan Whalen Turner and in this review THERE WILL be spoilers. If you haven't read the first book, The Thief, I strongly suggest you not to continue reading this. I think that, if you liked The Thief, you'll probably like this book even more. I'd rather not get into the synopsis to leave all details undiscovered but this book is way more complex than the first one. A big detail that makes the reading experience completely different is that, while The Thief was told in our Eugenides' unreliable narrator's first person POV, The Queen of Attolia is narrated in third person omniscient, therefore giving the reader a glimpse into all protagonists' minds and actions and a better understanding of the political mechanisms of the story. So while, on the one hand, this latter technique is more \"complete\" for the reader, who's not constrained into one single character's biased and purposefully misdirected point of view, on the other hand, this book lacks, for obvious reasons, the big jaw-dropper that made the first book so special. While in The Thief, the whole book revolved around obnoxious Gen who played the lion's share, in The Queen of Attolia other characters finally get to play protagonists' roles and the reader gets the chance to form a personal opinion on them, unfiltered by Gen's eyes. Eugenides is very much changed from the first book. He's still obnoxious, but more charmingly so. His relationship, hid friendship with Eddis reminded me often of Finnikin and Isaboe in Finnikin of the Rock, I have to say. He grows quite a lot in the course of the book and I really connected with his character. He's bound to break your heart very early in the story, be warned and he's not a character that will leave you indifferent. Attolia was also a great character to discover, perhaps one of the more fascinating and complex. A fierce woman, she is constantly underestimated by her enemies but she is also a victim of her environment, a woman who had to build herself with steel, who has been fed to the sharks from childhood and had to learn to fight and survive, or be eaten. Hints about the nature of her relationship with Eugenides are detectable right from the start of the story and, even though I still did not quite see where Eugenides' love came from, I was really pleased with how it was developed. I'm not giving this book the highest rating because, even though to a lesser extent, I had problems with the pacing, like for The Thief. It was a tad too focused on political intrigues and descriptions of war strategies for my taste. I felt caught up and extremely involved in some scenes with Eugenides or Attolia protagonists, but rather detached and slightly bored during conquering of islands and naval deployments.Furthermore, I don't know it if was specifically my edition of the book that lacked one but I felt in dire need of a map to follow all this moving around of people and ships. Maybe, with the help of a little map, I would have been able to follow better the action and I wouldn't have felt so uninterested. Still, I was very satisfied with the book, I love Turner's writing style, concise and very a propos \"military\" I daresay and will be looking forward to secure a copy of the next book The King of Attolia.

So our pleasant, feather-brained little fantasy romp grew a bigger, bitchiner sequel. Turner made the very good choice of switching from first person to roaming third, and tossed us straight in to political intrigue and war and post trauma.So \u2013 and, frankly, this is one of those spoilers that has to be revealed because talking about the book without it is like talking about Harry Potter without talking about magic . . . this sentence was going somewhere. Since when is drunk reviewing this hard?Anyway this book! Which I liked very much, this book is about acquired disability, and identity changed by trauma, and all of that stuff. I reflexively withdraw from books with sudden acquired disability plotlines. I am predisposed for dislike from two directions: I have the lifelong disabled person\u2019s disdain for badly done flailing and trauma and howling and \u201chow will I ever survive I\u2019d rather be dead\u201d (um, you may have heard me demurely mention this on a previous occasion), and at least in the past four years I\u2019ve also had the periodic raw-nerved sensitivity of sudden loss that can\u2019t tolerate acquired disability actually done well. So it\u2019s not that my standards are high so much as that they are . . . complicated.So reading this book and watching myself respond to it was actually really instructive in pinpointing what works in acquired disability stories and what doesn\u2019t. What I liked about this book was that the acquired disability and the post-violence trauma were different processes. People almost never get that right, but they really are. Even when they spring from the same event, and even though they are both fundamentally a kind of violence done to identity, they . . . operate in different keys. They are different necessities to reconcile the old identity with the new circumscribed reality, with what you can\u2019t do now and with what everyone else thinks you can\u2019t do (also two different things).The other thing I liked was that the disability in this book was not about fetishizing pain or woobiness, but instead about fetishizing the person who came out the other side. The former is far more frequently creepy than the latter. And here the process is nicely drawn, with some beautiful moments in Gen\u2019s long, quiet winter in his room, feeling out the new boundaries of his body one tiny increment at a time. And, \u201cI thought I was doing so well.\u201d Oh, yes.Here\u2019s what I didn\u2019t like. I think it is cheap and it is easy for author\u2019s to shorthand their character\u2019s post-disability trauma entirely into their discomfort with the injury being seen. It does make sense \u2013 the gazes of others are of course self-definitive, and this is a thing that people go through. But when you channel so much of the aftermath trauma into body discomfort you\u2019re playing with fire. Because disability is not biological. It is not somatoform. Disability is a sociological condition rooted in the embedded culture\u2019s incapacity to, I don\u2019t know, embrace universal fucking design, and the resultant discord it projects back at the disabled person. I realize I\u2019m being all modern social theory at a little young adult fantasy book, but you know what? You do have to deal with the physical pragmatics, but when you get bound up in this idea of body-based disability shame, you\u2019re permanently stuck in the physical and you can\u2019t get anywhere else. Anywhere a lot more interesting, frankly. Also, modern theory is just how I roll when I\u2019m tipsy.So anyway. It\u2019s a book about a smart-mouthed kid who gets hurt, and how he gets up again after, and how it hurts the people around him, and how it hurt the person who hurt him.

The Queen of Attolia though\u2026.well let\u2019s just say that it had some very unexpected and crazy surprises in store for me. It was so much better than the first book with complex characters and more than one twist I wasn\u2019t expecting. I really love it when a book blindsides me with something that I never saw coming and there were exactly 3 instances in this book where I had no clue \u2018that\u2019 was going to happen until the bomb dropped.This series might seem to read a little slower than some other fantasy novels because a lot of the tension and build up is political intrigue and posturing. It is about cunning and sneakiness, who is telling the truth, who is lying and is everything what it seems or something else entirely. I like smart dialogue like that where I\u2019m trying to figure out the true motives and intension of all those involved. I had inklings and suspicions of the actions and reactions of all the characters but I never once knew for sure and to me that is extremely entertaining.The characters and their emotions are complex and intricate. I started this book disliking the Queen of Attolia, shortly into this I despised her, then I grew to maybe feel some empathy for her, to finally possibly understanding her and perhaps maybe now I have an smidgen of like happening for her. It was an emotional journey and I can say definitively that I have a healthy respect for her character. She is smart, cunning, manipulative and merciless sometimes. But The Queen of Attolia is a great three dimensional character doing her best to rule a country full of Baron\u2019s who do not want to be ruled by her and she is so alone.\nThere was a shadow behind the wardrobe, a deeper one at the edge of the window curtains. She sat up against her pillows. She pulled the bedclothes up as far as they would go and suppressed a perverse wish to have her old nurse come to chase away the darkness, perverse because she didn\u2019t know if she wanted the shadows to be empty or not. She sat watching until the day dawned and the shadows lightened and were gone.\nEugenides totally WOWED me. His growth in this book alone is amazing. He is not just the scheming prankster of a boy he once was. He went through some very traumatic experiences in this book and they have changed him. He is different now, but we the readers get to travel with him through that transformation and it is not always easy. This book is sometimes much darker than the previous installment. Eugenides might have taken a little time to bounce back after his tragedy but he got there with a little nudging.\n\u201dStop whining.

That\u2019ll teach me to go hide in the temple.\u201d\nI had so much fun watching Eugenides get back on his feet and up to his old tricks. Everyone better watch out, he has a new ambition and plan that I think he was willing to go to the grave for.Eddis is another great character and smart Queen. It is so interesting to compare how similar and different she and Attolia are. Each is ruthless for their people and will do anything for those they care about. They are both smart, cunning and able to see into the true motivations of those around them. But where Attolia is surrounded by people trying to take a kingdom away from her Eddis is surrounded by family, friends and subjects that would protect and keep her in power at any cost. Eddis is allowed to seem softer and kinder because of this but do not let that fool you she is just as ferocious.\n\u201cMagus,\u201d she said from the doorway. \u201cI\u2019d heard that you had come.\u201d Eugenides swung to look at her. \u201cYou started a war in my name without telling me?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou will have to excuse me,\u201d said the queen to the magus as if she hadn\u2019t heard. \u201cI overslept, or I would have greeted you earlier.\u201d \u201cAre we at war with Attolia?\u201d Eugenides demanded. \u201cYes,\u201d said his queen. \u201cAnd Sounis?\u201d asked Eugenides. \u201cNearly,\u201d said Eddis.\nBeing a Queen at war leaves no room for sympathy in most. The battle between the two Queens showed how each used their strengths to maneuver against opponents. I enjoyed the alternating PoVs to get a full picture of the story.I was happily surprised by the direction this story took and I had a great time trying to figure out who was going to outmaneuver who. I think Eugenides wins in that regard though. I think he could test a monk\u2019s patience and get Gandhi into trouble. I\u2019m really interested in seeing what he will do in his new role for the next book.

I can't deny that it's an amazing book, but at times, I just wanted to throw it away and howl in frustration -- not because any of the characters were misbehaving, but because of the twists and the turns and all the bad things that I don't like happening to anyone. I think I should never write a book, ever, because I hate doing unpleasant things to my characters, and as for killing off characters I like -- forget it! The Queen of Attolia is one hell of a ride. If The Thief was fairly predictable, well, Turner makes up for it in spades with this book. I started saying WTF!!! about five pages into the book, and I didn't ever stop until the end of the book. Turner's writing just gets better and better. It's sort of like how I felt towards the Kate Daniels series. After the first book, I was shrugging my shoulders saying, What's all the hype about. And then I read the second book, and the third, and I couldn't stop or put the books down even though I hadn't slept in forty-odd hours, and my eyes were gummy and I looked like someone from the zombie apocalypse. The Thief was kind of the same experience. The first book was good, and I really liked it, but the second book was EPIC! (Sorry to steal your adjective, Jillian!) *** SPOILERS ***I love Gen, no two ways about it. He stays true to character in The Queen of Attolia, with flair, but no flamboyance. Turner does a brilliant job with his character, making him clever-as-hell, but very, very human. SO imagine my shock when this model character suddenly declares a hitherto unsuspected love for his nemesis! To fall in love with someone who so obviously scares the crap out of you, who tortures you till you've lost your reason for living, well, that just feels unhealthy. So when I first heard Gen's declaration, I was not buying the love story. That was one of the parts where I wanted to chuck my book against the wall, so it's a good thing I was reading an ebook. I wanted to scream NO NO NO, you were doing SO well!But you know what, Turner managed to make the whole thing believable! I'm not saying I'm totally convinced, and I had some The Fountainhead-type flashbacks, but I could deal with the love story, and that is saying a lot, considering how Turner spends most of the first half of the book making us hate The Queen of Attolia, despite her occassional glimpse of humanity. Again, the thing with the Mede ambassador was no big surprise, but this time I'm convinced Turner actually set it up that way. *** SPOILERS END HERE ***This book wrenched me out of my complacent Urban Fantasy hole, where it's all action with very little emotion (at least the stuff I've been reading lately!) turned my perceptions topsy turvy and made me want to cry, and cheer and laugh. I loved the experience, even if I hated some parts of the book. Some side characters I'd love to see more of are Sophos, who does not appear in this book at all, the Magus of Sounis, whom I'd like to see a lot more of, and Gen's father, who is so awesome for someone who gets about ten lines in total! I can't wait to go read the third book, and for anyone who hasn't gotten hooked on this series yet, go buy the book RIGHT NOW!"}, {"userName": "Peep (Pop!

I loved the first one, you know. I thought Gen was hilarious and really someone I'd like to have around with - even if he was annoying.The Queen of Attolia started out really good. I really was not expecting anything like that to happen. It was very surprising and I almost thought it was a dream. Where the first book had twists that had me smiling and gaping, this one had few. It was just ok. Eugenides had grown and changed so much that the only reason he is likable is because everyone else tells you and reminds you. Almost none of his original charm is there. He's quiet and brooding. Granted, he has reason to - but that doesn't mean I have to like it. And just when I thought the action would pick up and that there would be another twist absolutely nothing happens. It just keeps going until the end. I don't want to post spoilers so I can't elaborate, but I really thought that more was going to happen. The story just kind of ended in a ho-hum manner. A great portion of the book is devoted to talking about war and war strategy and where one army is and what this minister or Baron is thinking and it all became quite tiring after a while.Like I said, I really wanted to like this book and had high expectations.

But I'll just confirm it again anyway - cuz it IS. So much better.This is the story of two young, intelligent queens, Eddis and Attolia; it is a story full of political maneuvering and plays for power, of military strategizing and cunning. And in the midst of it all is Eugenides, the Queen\u2019s Thief, who, true to form, will surprise you in ways you least expect.Complex characters -- I LIKE them. The writing made for an interesting experience for me. It had a sort of distance to it, and normally that would make me feel detached and disconnected from the characters but that was not the case here. Rather, it lent an air of mystery to them - you never quite knew anyone's true motivations. Sure, you suspect things, but nothing feels cut and dry, not until actual revelations are made. I LIKE it.Note: If you read the first book and thought it was boring, I can see how this one may bore you also. The pace and storyline IS more exciting and intriguing than The Thief, BUT there are a lot of \"slow\" parts also made up of political and war strategizing.

It's the kind of fantasy not just written for teens, but smart enough to stand outside the YA genre on it's own.As for me, I have the lowest rating out of all my friends on here O.oWhat can I say? It's a book worthy of 5 stars, for sure. But I never rate the book, per se (it's hard enough rating as it is sometimes. I am often in a quandary over the whole star rating thing). My star ratings are an indication of my love/enjoyment of the book. Here, my three stars say I liked it: I could see it's quiet brilliance but it just (sadly, weirdly) didn't do much for me.

While I was massively underwhelmed by the first book\u2019s attempt at a plot, the Queen of Attolia is an example of plotting at its finest. It had everything I felt was lacking in the first novel, while retaining what I loved, namely the complex and distinct characters. The writing was punchy and concise, and managed to cover a huge amount of plot in only 350 pages. This is no fluffy, romance-heavy fantasy novel \u2013 thank the Lord - but a novel centred around political intrigues and genuinely cunning characters, not the Barbie characters I'm so often bombarded with by the fantasy genre. Novels like this are rare gems amongst the wash of contemporary YA fantasy and need to be treasured at all costs.My one gripe, and this is actually a pretty major gripe no matter how trivial it may seem, is that, while both books are told from Gen\u2019s perspective, The Thief is first-person and The Queen of Attolia is third-person. I see why the second book needed to be third-person \u2013 it had the odd scene from other perspectives including the eponymous Queen of Attolia \u2013 but why in the name of literary consistency was book one told in first person then? It just shows a lack of foresight and planning on Whalen-Turner\u2019s part, and I really dislike that in authors. I read the second immediately after the first so the sudden shift felt jarring and just plain wrong. Consistency is key in any book series.Anyway, besides that, it was pretty much close to perfect.

I just...wow. Talk about a sequel. In fact, I'm pretty sure that as sequels go The Queen of Attolia should be the standard textbook in a class entirely devoted to how to write a killer sequel. The kind of sequel that will leave your readers completely unable to contain their glee at how it was just as good as they weren't daring to hope it would be. The kind that makes them keep their husbands up at night expounding upon the splendor that is such a sequel. A note on the cover: I truly love the \"new\" covers. I do. But this one kind of makes me want to run and hide under the covers. And I'm glad I didn't see it until after I read the book. Rather, I went in blissfully unaware of what awaited me.A note on a spoiler: I generally try to avoid them. This review, however, may have to be an exception as there is one key plot element early on that is, well, integral to everything that happens thereafter. I can't find a way to dance around it, so consider yourself forewarned. The Thief of Eddis is on a secret mission for his queen in the heart of enemy territory. As he slips away into the night, something goes massively, horribly wrong and he is run down and captured by Attolian guards. For his audacity, Attolia takes his right hand and sends him back to his queen broken and on the brink of death. While Eugenides struggles to comes to terms with his drastically altered life, Eddis declares war on Attolia for his sake and the three countries are quickly at each other's throats. As their losses mount, Eugenides realizes there is one more thing he can steal from Attolia that will save his country from destruction. But, given their last encounter, does he have the courage to venture into Attolia again and face her one more time? Truth? I spent a a fair bit of time holding back sobs while reading this book. You see I fell in love with Eugenides. And he does not have an easy time of it here. The thing is he is so very awesome that you know he'll be okay. He has to be okay. But, still, his anguish and rage are so palpable it's hard to watch. And at the same time, my favorite scenes are the beautifully alternating passages in which Gen tries and fails and tries to piece his life together while, a world away, Attolia sits on her throne, staring blankly out the window, agonizing over what she did. It's so unexpected and had me glued to the page. And Turner's not kidding around with the love story. When it comes it takes your breath away. On top of it all this book's got a perfect ending. It'll make you smile through your tears."}, {"userName": "Melissa McShane", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1329059-melissa-mcshane", "userReview": "[I wrote in my review of The Thief that I'd forgotten Gen meets the Queen of Attolia in that book. What I had not forgotten is how complex a character she is--how from the beginning Gen troubles her mind and her heart. Having been goaded into cutting off his hand as punishment for stealing from her, she then can't stop thinking about him. I wonder how much of that is related to Moira having betrayed Gen to her, who doesn't believe in any gods (and why would she?). But it's comforting, and confounding, to watch her falling in love when she has no concept of it and no reason to love anyone, let alone the Thief of Eddis.Gen's reaction to being maimed is both heartbreaking and perfect. He goes through natural stages of grief and loss, and it takes a really long time for him to recover even to the point he does by the end of this book. And he's not fully recovered then, as we see in the sequel. Megan Whalen Turner said of this story that there were a lot of stories she might tell about Gen, but the next one (I'm paraphrasing), the important one to him, was the story of what happens when he's caught. Gen's character changes in profound ways because of what Attolia does to him, stripping away the childish flouting of authority but leaving him the certainty of who and what he is. He's still cocky and headstrong, but now it's because he's earned it.And the romance. When Gen tells Attolia/Irene (I tend not to think of her by her name until The King of Attolia) that he loves her, I feel most profoundly her confusion and dismay and even anger, because she cut off his damn hand and how can he possibly be telling the truth? Gen's relationship with her is and will always be complicated--having nightmares about being tortured by your beloved will do that--but I've never felt it was impossible. The very last scene, where the two of them talk about love and whether it matters or not, sticks with me: Attolia has done something that ought to put her beyond the reach of his love, and he loves her anyway. Loves her for who she is.The book is complex because it's happening on so many levels, but the one I can't stop thinking about is the long game the gods are playing with Gen, with Irene, with the Mede, with everyone. Gen's encounter with the goddess at the end, after Attolia reveals that it was the gods who told her how to capture him, says everything about how we so often don't see what's really going on until much later. The nameless goddess says:Softly Eugenides asked, \"Why did my gods betray me?\"\"Have they?\" asked the goddess as softly.\"To Attolia, to the Mede...\" Eugenides stuttered.\"Would you have your hand back, Eugenides? And lose Attolia? And see Attolia lost to the Mede?\"It's a telling question. What would you give up for your heart's desire? If Attolia's soul, and her love, could only come at the cost of Gen's hand, how much of a sacrifice would that be?The solution Eddis and Gen come up with, of Gen marrying Attolia and becoming King of Attolia, is a clever one on several levels (which might as well be the tagline for this novel, It Works On Every Level), not least because it gives Gen scope for his talents beyond the immediate needs of Eddis. Whether The King of Attolia is better than this one is a matter of personal preference, but I know I try not to read one without reading the other. This one, however, is truly brilliant.

I can\u2019t talk about any of the plot for this book without completely spoiling book one. And part of the beauty of these books is the clever plot. So instead I will talk about the characters, which in this book are many faceted and much more developed. We again follow our charming little thief Eugenides from book one and we also follow the Queen of Eddis and the Queen of Attolia. There are other characters but these are the main ones we follow. I loved the development for Eugenides in this book. You see a completely different side to him in this one. He is still whiny and arrogant, but something happens early in this book that changes he life forever. We see him change so much. He grows up that\u2019s for sure. But he is weak as well. We see him terrified, we see him broken, we see him depressed and in despair. We see that he can fail and that the Gods ain\u2019t always on the side you think they are. What I really loved about his character in this book was that his role changed. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he is still very much the Queen\u2019s Thief. But his methods have to change as do the items that he steals. The events of book one show you that Eugenides is tremendously clever, but you get to see much more of that cleverness in this one. And his smart thinking is very handy in the politics of this world. The character of Queen of Attolia was fantastic. Her character and her actions made me feel all sorts of emotions. At first I was terribly angry at her, believe me you will be too. I hated what she did and I hated her. As the book goes on you learn more about her. When you hear the story of how she became Queen your opinion of her will change. I guarantee it. I felt sorry for her and I started to appreciate what a strong woman she is. She is unsuspecting and ridiculously intelligent. She was underestimated because she was a woman and my oh my did she show them her strength. But you never know the full game she is playing. Or who her pawns are. She was a great character towards the end too. Although the ending did make me roll my eyes a little. The politics. Wow, they really make this book. I love it when you get to see the decisions getting made. Because you get all the different POV\u2019s, you get to see all sides of the coin. Each side has its own merits, strengths, weaknesses and flaws. None of the Countries are completely right or good and none of them are completely wrong or evil. Depending on the view point you are following, each of the Countries are the heroes. The ending, as I said earlier was a little hmmm predictable and cheap? I mentioned in my review for book one that I guessed how it was all going to play out. Well in this one I knew the endgame (warning do not read the character summaries at the end of the book, Spoilers are everywhere!) so I knew how it was going to end. But I didn\u2019t know the journey. I was waiting and waiting for Eugenides too pull of something really impressive and I just didn\u2019t happen I\u2019m afraid. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think in Gen\u2019s fucked up little mind his feeling are true. They might not make sense but I think there is truth to them. But I think they didn\u2019t make sense at this point in the story. Maybe after more time had past and he wasn\u2019t so bitter. As in the first book, I really liked the storytelling aspect to this book. You can just tell that one day, someone is going to be sat round a campfire telling someone the story of Eugenides the Queens Thief. I\u2019m looking forward to book three. Eugenides has some serious work and manipulation ahead of him.
