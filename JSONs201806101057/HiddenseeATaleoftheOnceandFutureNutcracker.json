Es un retelling muy particular, como ya lo fue 'Wicked' en el que los elementos del cuento son m\u00e1s bien p\u00edldoras que hay que saber encontrar, mientras que el autor desarrolla una historia completamente aut\u00f3noma por su parte. Me ha encantado la atm\u00f3sfera de cuento, la ambientaci\u00f3n de Alemania y el misticismo que aparece y desaparece en la obra, pero los personajes (especialmente el protagonista y su amigo Felix) no llegaron a engancharme. La lectura te atrapa pasada la mitad del libro y sorprende que haya menos fantas\u00eda de la que podr\u00eda parecer en un principio, pero esta es una historia llena de gui\u00f1os para los amantes de los cuentos de hadas, yo la he disfrutado y sobre todo me ha dejado con ganas de leer el cuento de Hoffman y m\u00e1s obras de Maguire.Pd.

I should\u2019ve known better than to trust Maguire to instill holiday cheer into anything he writes. I was definitely not filled with cheer and goodwill while reading this, which was a disappointment I should\u2019ve seen coming.Was this a bad book? No. It retold a familiar story in a new and unfamiliar way, from the perspective of Drosselmeier, the toy maker who crafted the eponymous Nutcracker. And Drosselmeier\u2019s story was an interesting one. But just as he had an incredibly difficult time connecting emotionally to other people, so did I with his story. I found it intellectually compelling but emotionally unsatisfying.I\u2019ve enjoyed Maguire\u2019s work in the past. Wicked was, in my opinion, an incredibly original retelling of a story that has been told so often that it lost a bit of its life and flavor. Wicked revitalized the Wizard of Oz for me, giving it a depth that I had missed. Elphaba was a far richer character than I would have expected, and I always enjoy seeing both heroes and villains in a different light, as Maguire presented both Dorothy and the Wicked Witch, along with various other characters made famous in the original. That\u2019s what I was hoping for from Hiddensee, but it\u2019s not what I got. I wanted more depth and richness added to a tale I love. And indeed, Maguire did add aspects to the old tale that were interesting, as I said before. But I just didn\u2019t care about Drosselmeier like I yearned to. I didn\u2019t see the Nutcracker in a new light that surprised and delighted me. I saw him given a new purpose, but he was lifeless in the pages of this book. And honestly, the tone of this book reminded me of Uprooted, which I hated. If you loved Uprooted, you might really enjoy this book.One of the amazing things about fairy tales and folk tales is their ability to entrance us and move us in a very limited number of pages. Hiddensee felt both too long for a fairy tale and too short for a deeper, more compelling novel, leaving it on a shaky middle ground where it was unable to keep its footing. Of course, this is a personal opinion, as all of my reviews are. But now I feel the need to track down the original story to rid myself of the sour residue left by Maguire\u2019s book, so I can reclaim a story I love. If anyone has another retelling of this story that they love, please share it with me; I don\u2019t want my vision of the Nutcracker to stiffen with age.Original review can be found at Booknest."}, {"userName": "Erin Clemence", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16907451-erin-clemence", "userReview": "Hiddensee by Gregory Maguire tells the story of Drosselmeier, the man responsible for creating the Nutcracker, as well as how he came to give it to young Klara. Full of Maguire\u2019s typical prose and poetic language, Drosselmeier starts as a young boy living with Hansel and Gretel in the woods. When a tragic accident leaves him without an eye and brings him to \u201cthe other side\u201d and back, Drosselmeier is then sent to live with various families until he is old enough to become a toymaker. When his beloved friend Felix dies, Drosselmeier assumes paternal responsibility for Felix\u2019s children and develops a quick bond with Felix\u2019s granddaughter, Klara, a sickly girl who lives in a world of fantasy that is very similar to Drosselmeier\u2019s own. \u201cHiddensee\u201d is a short novel to read, with quick chapter that flow together rather nicely. Drosselmeier\u2019s story, as told by Maguire, is an interesting one, full of mystery, fantasy and family. Normally, I find Maguire\u2019s writing a little hard to take, with his extravagant, expanded vocabulary that has be scrambling for a dictionary at least once per page. In this instance though, \u201cHiddensee\u201d was far more digestible, while still remaining beautifully written. Drosselmeier is the ultimate misfit- alone for most of his life due to his creative imaginings and strange behaviours, he finds love in the wrong places and with the wrong people until finally finding an adopted family of his own. He is a wonderful anti-hero, creating empathy and connection with the reader. The story is well-told, with well-developed characters and a smooth flow. Creative and charming, this novel is the perfect novel for the holiday season. Set in \u201cBavaria\u201d and its surrounding lands, \u201cHiddensee\u201d takes us through beautiful, isolated settings, with strange customs and characters from fairy tales. This novel has a distinctive and sweet ending, allowing for the satisfying finality I love in novels like this. \u201cHiddensee\u201d is a great re-imagining of the Nutcracker, told in the way only Maguire can.

Maguire has a shtick, which is fine. I love a good reinvention of a story, but I noticed as the sequels to Wicked went on the gas ran out of them until Out of Oz managed to patch everything up. Hiddensee never gathers enough energy to have a spark.This novel is about Drosselmayer, the eye-patched godfather who gives Clara the nutcracker at the beginning of the story. The narrative begins near the end of the Napoleonic wars, but young Dirk is raised in isolation by a woodcutter and his wife until an incident propels him into the wider world. The wider world propels him to go from place to place until the book ends.Very little happens in the novel. Its not unusual that Dirk keeps many thoughts to himself - in fact some of the most fantastical elements of the story he completely forgets about for years - but the introverted child/young man doesn't often include the reader either, which is unusual. Instead we have narration of events happening, time passing, and just about when the story starts to get going, our guy has a purpose, we're winding up for the finish. Was there a solution? Who can say?I missed something. I know I did. If I didn't miss something, some important psychological depth or metaphor or whatever, then there is nothing here. I finished it, which is something. The story is inoffensive.

It's a story I hold near and dear to my heart, if for nothing than the nostalgia. I've likewise, spent my entire adult life raving up and down the streets, parties, anyone who will bother listening to me my utter and COMPLETE love of Gregory Maguire's work. Having been a voracious reader at a very young age, fairy tales have always interested me, so growing up and finding this intelligent, adult narrations and retellings of my favorite stories were like my dreams had been answered. So, now, imagine what my reaction was to find out an author I adore and admire for his creativity and beautiful way with words was going to grant me the pleasure of reading his take on such a beloved story. Really, imagine. Kermit waving his wands around like a limp puppet has nothing on me.For those of us unaware of the story of the Nutcracker, the story was originally written by E. T. A. Hoffman in 1816, revised by Alexandre Dumas in 1844 and adapted as a ballet in 1892. The story follows Marie Stahlbaum, sometimes known as or Clara in the ballet, as she awaits with her siblings to see what gifts their godfather, a clockmaker, has brought them for Christmas. She almost immediately becomes infatuated with a nutcracker that her brother insists on breaking after attempting to crack a nut just a bit too large. Upset, Marie puts the nutcracker to sleep and is started when the nutcracker seems to come alive inciting what could only consider the most fantastic of all fever dreams. Mice begin to attack, along with their seven-headed mouse king, and the Nutcracker leaps to life to defend Marie with the assistance of her dolls. When the fight begins to look bleak, Marie whips off her slipper and flings it at the Mouse King (also my favorite part of the ballet). Of course, no one believes her because she's just a child. But, after fixing her beloved nutcracker her godfather regales Marie the story of\u00a0Princess Pirlipat and the Mouse Queen, a story of revenge and the birth of the Nutcracker. It eventually ends with a final battle with the new Mouse King and Marie being whisked away to the Nutcracker's doll kingdom or in the ballet, after the Land of Sweets.Hiddensee is the amazing, beautifully written story from childhood to adulthood of Marie's (or Marie-Claire) godfather Dirk Drosselmeier. At first, I wasn't sure what I was expecting from this book. Part of me wanted a pure retelling of the story I've grown so fond of, but I was pleasantly elated at the peak into the life of the man behind the woodcarving. There was so much mythology, Germanic and Greek, and true to Maguire's nature, he spent plenty of time setting up each nook and cranny until the entire story became perfectly allied for that fateful night on Christmas Eve. Maguire's prose is majestic and carried me over each page until I realized I had signed into a perfect ending in one sitting.\u00a0Dirk is a lovable dolt of a character, both burdened and naive by his youth being raised by unloving guardians (a hint into some Brother's Grimm) who he fled from after an ancient in the forest left him with a single working eye. Dirk himself seems to straddle the line between reality and fantasy in a way that had me hook and invested in his every thought. While he seemed unable to allow himself to believe the frivolous things of a child, he also rarely allowed himself to feel other things as well, like romance, lust, and true happiness. He seemed stuck. While he learns as he grows up to feed into other children's games in place of his own childhood, he fails to belong. He's neither child nor fully adult.\u00a0If anything this story begs for us to reclaim our childhoods and our pasts to find that moment that brought us so much joy and cherish it, because before we know it, it could be too late and it'll take a sweet girl and her stories to show us what we missed out on."}, {"userName": "Patty", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3550357-patty", "userReview": "You have to go into reading a book by Gregory Maguire with an open mind. I didn\u2019t know that when I read my first book authored by him but it\u2019s apparent pretty quickly that you are entering a different kind of world. His books are not going to be for everyone and I\u2019ve run into people that love them as I do and just as many that don\u2019t get them. I find it surprising that I enjoy them as much as I do as I am such a literal thinker. To me that is a testament to Mr. Maguire\u2019s ability to create a reality within his fantasy worlds. To somehow ground them in enough that is believable for a person to accept animals that talk or worlds beyond the type we inhabit.Hiddensee is not the Nutcracker\u2019s story but rather his creator\u2019s. Like most I suspect, I had never given much thought to this aspect of the tale, but rather only to the more familiar; the young girl, the Sugar Plum Fairy and the Nutcracker. Tchaikovsky\u2019s music is familiar to most and calls to mind the happy children skipping along and of course that famous dancing fairy.This book, though goes to dark places. The godfather who sets the tale in motion bringing the Nutcracker to little Klara is the focus of Hiddensee and his back story is not really a happy one. It\u2019s this tale that Maguire mines for his book. He takes his reader through a rather dark childhood through the use of the German fairytales that most of us grew up on and the author assumes his reader has at least a general knowledge of these tales. I don\u2019t know if they are still told to children but some of the first stories I was read included Grimm\u2019s fairy tales. Seemingly happy for children but far more threatening when read through the eyes of an adult, eh?The godfather\u2019s origins were not happy and this book explores that and at times it can get a little slow but overall the magic that is Mr. Maguire\u2019s writing pulls you out of those sections and the overall reading experience is like eating a sugar plum.4.5"}, {"userName": "Cecilia Rodriguez", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16371012-cecilia-rodriguez", "userReview": "The story begins in 1808 Bavaria and has little in common with Tchaikovsky's famousballet.There is an over whelming bias against Catholicism, with the story being extreamly muddledwith obscure hints towards Ibsen's: \"Peer Gynt.\"The references to Homosexuality are awkward and have little effect on the weakly written main story line.I would skip this book and find a local production of the Nutcracker instead."}, {"userName": "Karin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4747030-karin", "userReview": "Best one yet."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48387506-melanie", "userReview": "Gregory Maguire's darkly whimsical revisionist tales of western culture's favorite folklore and children's stories sometimes have a polarizing effect on its audience. But Maguire has always been brutally honest with the hardships of his worlds and brutally adult in the telling of these stories we've always aimed at children. In this book, we follow the life Dirk Drosselmeier after an apparent near-death experience gives him visions of woodland spirits he fears will one day return to kill him and runs from his home into the world of 18th century Bavaria. Dirk, at various stages in his life, serves as an assistant to the clergy, a caretaker of noble children, and, ultimately, a toymaker, who crafts \"the once and future nutcracker\" for a would-be love of his who has frenzied dreams about opening a walnut from her native Persia. It takes Tchaikovsky's passionate ballet as its backdrop and ending point. However, in true Maguire fashion, it's riddled with cynicism and darkness. Rather than a musical fairytale retold, this novel is a dark and highly literary look at an otherwise magical tale. Maguire skirts close to something interesting with the introduction of Doctor Mesmer, the discussions of the intersection of Teutonic myth and Christianity, and the glittering feel of Christmastime but keeps the tale one of woe for a quiet and \"dolt\" of a boy who, by his own account, failed at life but unknowingly brought magic to the feverish dreams of Klara on Christmas Eve. The story moves forward with fluid pace, even if I wanted to see more focus on the underlying themes of the story. Despite Wicked being riddled with, sometimes overt, discussions of the nature of evil, this novel keeps its discourse short and contained and it left me wanting more of the bluntness of Wicked's lessons. Maguire has made a staple of revising these stories and he does it in a masterfully unique way that only he seems capable of handling throughout an entire career. Even if Hiddensee was far from my favorite of Maguire's works, it was a story consistent with her writing and creative concepts."}, {"userName": "Isa-janis", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5827918-isa-janis", "userReview": "Aunque la ambientaci\u00f3n alemana, casi atemporal, de la historia me ha parecido interesante, este inter\u00e9s se ha perdido mucho con el protagonista.

I love everything Gregory Maguire writes. Here, he takes on the folklore surrounding the Nutcracker and comes up with a highly satisfying novel that takes place in early 19th century Germany (Bavaria, Prussia), around the time when the fabled toymaker Godfather Drosselmeier might have lived.Dirk Drosselmeier is a drifting, unrooted type of character, a subject Maguire likes so much and does so well. I love that Maguire delved more directly into gay/bisexual relationships. The story is still quite chaste for sure, another one of the author's trademarks; but the painfully tentative relationship between Dirk and his unrelenting friend Felix creates a new dimension of interest in what could be familiar territory: the struggle for belonging, a haunted childhood past.Don't get me wrong. I could read those kind of stories by Maguire every day of the week, but it's also nice to see him taking chances.There's something especially touching about Hiddensee, and as much as Maguire's titles often deal with loneliness and heartbreak, I can't recall tearing up when reading one of his books before. Then again, maybe I don't remember. The whole Wicked trilogy had lots of poignant moments. With Hiddensee, I felt that Maguire makes use of metaphor particularly effectively, and I was misty eyed through the last quarter of the book as Dirk finally comes to terms with his past and finds his legacy in his goddaughter Klara, to whom he passes along what he has learned from his life's riddles: \"the lost forest,\" \"the hidden walnut.\" Beautiful stuff."}, {"userName": "Bean", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5186192-bean", "userReview": "This is an ok book and I think it suffers a lot by a preconceived idea of what the story will be. It isn't an upside down retelling of the Nutcracker ala Wicked. It is more a prequel of the original story with it getting to familiar territory in the final third of the book. It is a slow one, and it wanders and rambles often, but by the end of it I had some affection towards it. There is a sweetness to it. Go in with an open mind and the knowledge this isn't Wicked : Christmas Edition and you might feel some fondness for it too.Now! Hiddensee related but not really Hiddensee related..This book has Mesmer in it for some quirky reason (also a page with Chopin). Mesmer was an actual person and he is why we have the lovely word Mesmerize. The only thing I know about the man I learned from watching this movie :It isn't really a good movie and you will spend a good portion of it being quite confused but if you do get a chance to see it, do. One, it has Alan Rickman, that alone is reason enough. It is also completely nutters. If a 1/4 of the film is factual then the man was a fount of entertainment. Needless to say whenever I read any of the Mesmer passages in the book I saw him as Rickman and it was really pretty darn great."}, {"userName": "Piepie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/663327-piepie", "userReview": "I love all things pertaining to \"The Nutcracker\", and so I thought I would like this book... but it turned out to be far too weird and disjointed for my taste. I found it boring and confusing and almost threw in the towel. There's a particular, confusing scene in a hayloft between Dirk and his friend Felix that I really don't think was necessary. I only really became interested during the last 100 or so pages - when Drosselmeier opens his toy shop and you can see familiar figures from The Nutcracker - the mice, Mother Ginger, and of course the Nutcracker himself, who is really a prince. This was kinda nice to read before the holiday, but overall I wouldn't recommend it."}, {"userName": "Teresa Crawford", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7258525-teresa-crawford", "userReview": "I really wanted to like this book and being that it was the last book that I would read of 2017, I thought it fitting.

T. A. Hoffmann\u2014the enchanted Black Forest of Bavaria and the salons of Munich. Hiddensee imagines the backstory of the Nutcracker, revealing how this entrancing creature came to be carved and how he guided an ailing girl named Klara through a dreamy paradise on a Christmas Eve. At the heart of Hoffmann's mysterious tale hovers Godfather Drosselmeier\u2014the ominous, canny, one-eyed toy maker made immortal by Petipa and Tchaikovsky's fairy tale ballet\u2014who presents the once and future Nutcracker to Klara, his goddaughter.But Hiddensee is not just a retelling of a classic story. Maguire discovers in the flowering of German Romanticism ties to Hellenic mystery-cults\u2014a fascination with death and the afterlife\u2014and ponders a profound question: How can a person who is abused by life, shortchanged and challenged, nevertheless access secrets that benefit the disadvantaged and powerless? Ultimately, Hiddensee offers a message of hope. If the compromised Godfather Drosselmeier can bring an enchanted Nutcracker to a young girl in distress on a dark winter evening, perhaps everyone, however lonely or marginalized, has something precious to share.", "title": "Hiddensee: A Tale of the Once and Future Nutcracker", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34217477-hiddensee", "average": 3.24, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1499677557l/34217477.jpg", "reviews": 535, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7025.Gregory_Maguire", "name": "Gregory Maguire"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Fiction", "Historical", "Retellings", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34217477-hiddensee", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38824341-hiddensee", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36518079-hiddensee", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34555335-hiddensee", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34216942-hiddensee", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37442.Wicked", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18943.Confessions_of_an_Ugly_Stepsister", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13521.Son_of_a_Witch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15858.Mirror_Mirror", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3124249-a-lion-among-men", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
