This standalone story kept me in the Christmas spirit while offering some humor, mystery, and light romance. I enjoyed meeting a number of characters, and there is a twist that surprised me quite a bit. I loved how descriptive the setting of NYC was- this is a favorite vacation spot of mine and these references instantly transported me there. I also very much enjoyed that each chapter is broken up by a quote about books. I LOVE BOOKS!!!...and so do you if you're on this website! Despite these many positives, I have to admit that my investment in this story ebbed and flowed at times. I can't really put my finger on what it was that kept my interest from being consistent, but whatever it was it unfortunately affected my reading experience just a bit. Overall, I liked it though so I rated it 3 stars. I would recommend A Gift to Remember to fans of Christmas novels or fans of the chick lit genre in general. Personally, I would be interested in checking out another story from this author. Enjoy!My favorite quote:\"'With some stories, you really can't rush things,' she told him, 'and it's often best just to set back and enjoy the journey for what it is.'\""}, {"userName": "Branwen Sedai *of the White Ajah*", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5701086-branwen-sedai-of-the-white-ajah", "userReview": "\"Anyone who says that money can't buy happiness has clearly never been inside a bookstore.\"This book was one of the most delightful and wonderful books I have ever read!

Everything was over explained (she said about 50 billion things related to how much she liked books), so many grammar mistakes, and it was set in New York and written from a New Yorker's perspective but the author seemed to be British because of certain ways of spelling and phrases. Not that people can't write about a culture not their own, but in this case it caused disconnect. To top it off, I thought it had a very corny storyline!

Darcy Archer is Melissa Hill's wonderfully created heroine and I want her life! Darcy works in Chaucers; an independent bookstore in Manhattan, New York. Darcy loves books, she loves them with a passion and spends most of her life surrounded by them, or immersed in them.\"Darcy was indeed too fond of books - a condition known as 'bibliolatry'. She always had at least one book on the go close by, and felt almost naked without a novel on her person. Darcy had been enveloped in a story every single day of her life for as long as she could remember, and tended to use every opportunity - waiting in line, eating, occasionally even while brushing her teeth - to indulge in her greatest pleasure.'A Gift to Remember is warm, funny and the perfect escapist read. There is plenty about the plot in the synopsis above; but basically Darcy knocks a guy out by running him down on her bicycle. This guy is Aiden, but he's lost his memory and hasn't a clue about anything to do with his life before the accident. Aiden had two clues on him when the accident happened; a beautifully packaged parcel and a husky dog called Bailey. Darcy is consumed with guilt, and not only takes on the care of Bailey whilst Aiden is in hospital, but does her best to track down his friends and family.The next few days are a bit of a roller-coaster ride for Darcy, as she finds herself associating with the New York elite, and making friends with her grumpy old lady neighbour. Darcy learns so much about herself, she realises that actually, the old lady next door is a real treasure and is lonely, not grumpy; she learns that you really shouldn't judge a book by its cover, and that Jimmy Choo shoes make a mighty fine dog chew!Melissa Hill is really talented in creating characters that the reader will fall in love with. Darcy's colleagues at Chaucers, her neighbours, the mysterious Aiden and of course the wonderful Bailey the husky dog. The winter streets of New York play an enormous part in this story too, and the city is a character itself.I enjoyed A Gift to Remember so much, I especially loved the literary quotes at the head of each chapter that so captured the contents of the pages to come."}, {"userName": "Rosie", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41714075-rosie", "userReview": "This is definitely one of my fav books of the year.

He is whisked to the hospital and she is left at the scene with his dog, whom everyone has forgotten. He has amnesia, so she runs around the city of NY piecing together clues about his life and falling in love with him without spending time with him.

In the story, it's Christmastime in NYC. Darcy is a bibliophile who works in a little Indie bookstore and is pretty happy with her life and her bike. She rides to work every day on it. But then she runs into Aidan and his dog and her world is turned upside down. Suddenly she's in charge of the care of a very well-trained, but large Husky dog. She's trying to piece together Aidan's life and why no one has come looking for him. (He is left from the accident with amnesia.)The whole book is a huge mystery. Who is Aidan really? And is he someone that could actually be the perfect guy for Darcy like it seems?As a book person, I loved this story. Darcy is a huge reader and not too surprising with her name, is a huge Pride and Prejudice fan. The book is filled with incredible books (the library featured in the story made me drool) and tons of literary mentions and tidbits to keep any book person happy. But the best thing about this story was Darcy's tenacity with trying to help Aidan. She didn't know him before the accident and is desperately trying to track down someone who did. There has to be someone out there missing him, right? It's the holidays. No one should be alone. But that's truly what this story is about...two (or even three if you count Darcy's neighbor who gets caught up in helping with the dog) lonely people who find kindred souls from this accident. It's truly a sweet, heart-warming story that was perfect for me as a holiday read. A lot of holiday books are over the top with the schmaltz...this one was not that way at all. It was wonderfully entertaining with so many twists at the end that I never saw coming. I love that! The author did an incredible job weaving the story and I definitely was kept guessing.

In the beginning I was fine with Darcy and her adventures, even though the whole setup was very quaint and over-explanatory. Then we got to Aiden's POV and I swear, all my goodwill disappeared. I get that the author is trying to portray him as the good guy, but he constantly says how he's just a humble Irish guy who works hard, how he loves animals, how he's not like everyone else, did I mention how humble and down to earth he says he is, also he's not into money even though his job lets him mingle with rich people. Too much. Also the whole secret thing got annoying after a while, and I feel like Darcy got neglected at the end because the focus was on Aiden.

She\u2019s such a clever author, she\u2019s the Queen of the Plot Twist (copyright me) and to know she was releasing two books in 2013 was utterly amazing! Two chances to read a new Melissa Hill book in one year? Fantastic. I wish she could keep it up and join the other legions of two-books-a-year authors. I\u2019m greedy like that, y\u2019see so when my competition win copy of A Gift To Remember arrived, I nearly died of happiness seeing it in it\u2019s beautiful gift bag (yes, a gift bag). I couldn\u2019t wait to dive in and I wasn\u2019t disappointed.Everyone who loves books must think that the best book you can ever read is about books themselves. Duh. Isn\u2019t that really obvious? It is to me, anyway. I love reading books about books, and bookstores, and the like so when I knew A Gift To Remember when set in the reading world, well, I was happy as a pig in mud! The plot sounds very similar to the Sandra Bullock movie While You Were Sleeping (which I haven\u2019t seen, so I can\u2019t say if it\u2019s definitively similar), but the basic premise is this: On riding her bike to work one day (at Chaucer\u2019s, where I want to go and LIVE), Darcy Archer accidentally runs over a man, and ends up knocking him out so badly he ends up in the hospital. Darcy is racked with guilt, especially when she realises the ambulance guys have left his dog behind, along with a sturdy, beautifully-wrapped gift. She\u2019s desperate to make amends, and wants to get Bailey, the dog, back to his rightful owner, but as Darcy delves into Aidan\u2019s life, it\u2019s like looking into the life of her perfect life partner, but that\u2019s crazy, right?A Gift To Remember is a book lovers dream book. Filled with the tales of Chaucers, the book store where Darcy works, where I\u2019d like to go work, filled with book quotes from famous authors, and is just so bookish! It\u2019s lovely. It\u2019s the best type of book a person could write, and I adored diving into the novel. I adored everything, really. The characters were so lovely, I really felt for Darcy, because what she did wasn\u2019t on purpose! I loved how eager she was to help Aidan and to get Bailey back to his owner along with the gift bag. I loved digging into Aidan\u2019s life and learning more about him and I found the snippets pertaining to his life to be both fascinating and mind-bogglingly confusing (if I\u2019m being honest). Aidan\u2019s life is definitely a massive puzzle and as the novel was going on and on I did find myself getting frustrated with so many loose ends; it was like an episode of Lost, more questions than answers and the questions just kept on coming!Though, I will admit, the novel did give a spectacular payout and when it all started unwinding and we started to learn how it all connected and came together, I was so glad I\u2019d kept reading and it was so worth it. It is, after all, what Melissa does best. She constructs such fascinating puzzles and when you see the finished product you\u2019re like \u201cWow, that was actually pretty great\u201d, she\u2019s been known to shock me from time to time with her revelations so I don\u2019t know why I was surprised. It is her forte after all. It is absolutely worth sticking with all the questions because the answers are pretty special. Lost may not have ended too well (not that I can say, I gave up sometime in Season 4), but A Gift To Remember most certainly did. There was even a reference to one of my favourite shows The Big Bang Theory in there, featuring Siri and Raj\u2019s infamous love story\u2026 A beautiful novel, proving that the strap line on my proof copy that states Melissa is the Queen of the modern fairytale isn\u2019t too far off the mark!"}, {"userName": "Margaret Madden", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21224317-margaret-madden", "userReview": "Thanks to Simon and Schuster UK for approving a review copy via Netgalley.Book lover, Darcy Archer, has the ideal job in a small independent bookstore in Manhattan. For a single girl, in her thirties, who adores classic literature and surrounds herself with books at home and work, she is quite content. Her dreams are set in the world of Jane Austen and the Bronte Sisters. She has a tiny apartment, regularly meets us with her aunt, who raised her after her parents death, and enjoys her daily bike ride through the busy streets of the city. That is, until she runs over a man out walking his dog, and things get a little bizzare. The man, unconscious, is rushed off in an ambulance but Darcy is left with his rather large dog and no idea how to reunite them. There is also a beautifully wrapped gift left at the scene of the accident and she feels obliged to make sure the present also makes it to its intended owner. She begins a the unusual manhunt and, with some help from her fellow booksellers, she finds Aidan. Happy ever after, right? Actually, no. There is a small problem. Other than his name, Aidan has no memory of his life before the collision. Trapped in the hospital, it is left to Darcy to try and figure out who Aidan is, and why no one seems to be looking for him?This novel is set in the snowy December period that lends to some beautiful descriptions of Manhattan, and all its glories, under the crisp frost, ice and snow. Christmas shoppers are out in force and the atmosphere is positively dreamy. However, I read this on a (rare) scorcher of a day in Ireland, and didn't feel the out-of-season vibe that a reader sometimes gets when turning the pages of a Christmas book. The season is irrelevant to the story, so don't be put off by a bit of snow or fairy lights on the streets.One of my favourite aspects of the book was that each chapter begins with a famous literary quote. Each one seems to be have lovingly chosen rather than just Googled and I recognised a lot along the way. Darcy's character was a complete book nerd, which I am too, and I felt like we could be great friends if she wasn't fictional! Her investigative skills were a bit slumped and not thought through very well, but I think this was perfect for her persona. More pen and paper than i-cloud, letter writing than e-mails. I found her work colleagues a lovely addition, a real mix of characters that gelled well, despite their different backgrounds.I have been a fan of Melissa Hill for many years and was delighted to see that, if anything, she is getting better and better with each book. I have added this to my Top 5 reads for summer, as not many books cause me to ignore all my daily chores and even forget to feed my children at their normal times. Maybe the sunshine helped, maybe it was pure laziness, but I think it was more that I was in Darcy's world for those three or four hours and could smell the bookstore, feel the spines of the classics and wanted to be walking down the streets of Manhattan with my dog on a lead and a Starbucks in my hand. Well done Melissa. A fantastic light read, with fab quotes and lots of book talk.

As a book-lover, I really appreciated the book-mad main character and the air of mystery and intrigue kept me turning pages rapidly.My Recap of A Gift to Remember :Darcy while cycling to work in New York crashes into a pedestrian who loses his memory from the knock. She works hard to solve the mystery of who Mr Harris really is and in trying to work out his life, she may just come to a few realisations about her own too.First Line of A Gift to Remember :\"Anyone who says that money can't buy happiness has clearly never been inside a bookstore.\"My Thoughts on A Gift to Remember :Darcy is so like me in lots of ways that I adored reading about her. She is obsessed with books and all things literary, she works in a fab sounding book shop in NYC and her future ambitions to run bookish walking tours around NYC just sound like so much fun. I'd love to meet Darcy in real life as I think we'd spend hours talking about all the books in our lives. But with her nose stuck in a book so much, she does at times leave real life pass her by. At night, she dreams of meeting not Mr Right but her Mr Darcy.So when she bangs in to Mr Harris (literally!), you just know her life is going to change for the better. And Darcy sets off on a mysterious and puzzling quest as to Mr Harris's real identity. I had no idea what direction this was taking and I was kept guessing and plotting until nearly the end of the book. I wasn't expecting the twist and I loved it. I know this author is queen of the twists and every time I think, I'll get this one but I NEVER do! The award for book trickery goes to Melissa Hill yet again :O The romance is perfect. Darcy and Mr Harris are like a match made in a book...oh wait...I forgot for a second that is what they are! They are both realistic and warm and just so genuine that I want the mushiest of scenes for them. And when Mr Harris came to the bookshop, my heart beat just those few beats faster than normal. So swoony, I felt starry eyed and had all the feels.As always a New York location never fails to excite me. Add in a bookshop background and lots of snow and this all makes for a vibrant and romantic setting. Every chapter starts with book lover quotes or famous quotes from books and so many of them are old favourites that it was lovely to see them in this book and they all just seemed so appropriate to the storyline. And I have to mention Bailey who is Mr Harris's husky dog, I just want to hug him to death and buy him a hot dog.Overall this book made me swoon, made me laugh, puzzled the hell out of me and gave me a fantastic few hours entertainment. I loved it and have no doubt it will be reread again in the future.Who should read A Gift to Remember ?If you are a fan of puzzling books with great characters and a romantic, feel-good vibe then you should check this one out. It gets my 5 star stamp of approval and that isn't something I give easily."}, {"userName": "Jody", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3521757-jody", "userReview": "Review first posted on my blog: http://spoonfulofhappyendings.blogspo...Darcy Archer has her dream job working as the manager of a small bookstore in Manhattan, since there is nothing in the world she loves more than books.

One day when she is cycling through New York in a hurry because she has overslept for work, she crashes into a man who is walking his dog. The man, whose name is Aiden, is taken to hospital and Darcy is left to take care of the dog, Bailey. Darcy feels incredibly guilty and manages to track down Aiden, who suffers from memory loss after the accident. She wants to do anything she can to help him find his family and friends, but as she learns more about Aiden she starts to wonder whether he might be the One for her...I personally love Melissa Hill\u2019s novels; she\u2019s a simply wonderful author whose writing style I really enjoy, and \u2018A Gift to Remember\u2019 has to be my favourite novel of hers so far. I found it incredibly easy to get into the story and to relate to the main protagonist, Darcy. Her passion for books and belief in romance are aspects I share with Darcy, and I really loved joining her on her search to discover Aiden\u2019s life. I couldn\u2019t help but develop a little crush on Aiden as I continued reading and I didn\u2019t want to put the book down before I knew what would eventually happen to him and Darcy. However, there\u2019s also another character who managed to steal the spotlight every now and again and that\u2019s Bailey, Aiden\u2019s dog, who is just incredibly cute and made me want to jump into the pages and hug him over and over again!Even though some of the descriptions of the story say it is a Christmas story, it is perfect to pick up throughout the entire year. There are some references to Christmas Eve, but I definitely wouldn\u2019t describe it as a Christmas book. Another aspect of the book I\u2019d like to mention because I personally really loved it, is the quotes at the start of each chapter.

It also mentioned several eateries in NYC that we're going to have to try."}, {"userName": "Roberta Capizzi", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13271196-roberta-capizzi", "userReview": "A cute and sweet read. Although it started a little slow, I immediately bonded with Darcy, a real bookworm and daydreamer like me. The unexpected twist at the end was the highlight of the book and I couldn't put it down until I finished. I was happy for the epilogue, as I felt it was needed.Although not as good as my personal favorite from this author (Something from Tiffany's), it was a nice Christmassy read that real bookworms will appreciate."}, {"userName": "Rachel Gilbey", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5801320-rachel-gilbey", "userReview": "Loved this book.

There were a lot of bookish references since the main character is a bookworm herself. Although, she's mainly focusing on classics but its still great nonetheless. Let me just say that I want her life. She is literally living my dream life. She's a bookworm, would rather work in a bookstore than some other job that can only provide you with salary but none of your interest whatsoever. She also majored in Fine Arts Writing which sounds super amazing. The best of all, she lives in New York City, the city that never sleeps. This book tells you more about the riches and the elites that abide in New York City. Their standard and way of living is definitely beyond what I can imagine. This book is definitely an interesting read. It made me crave for what is about to happen next and what will await me at the end. I did not expect the ending at all but I like it anyway."}, {"userName": "Johanna", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19034781-johanna", "userReview": "3.5\u2b50\ufe0f read.
