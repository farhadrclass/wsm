Having been utterly ignorant of the various plot twists, I was able to enjoy \"Marriage\" to the fullest. Yes, it's lyrical and poetic, as Greer is one of the most naturally gifted writers I've come across in years, but many literary novels get lost in this emphasis on stylistic narrative and character development, failing to realize that most readers come to fiction to simply be entertained by a good story. Greer avoids this elitist trap, and throws some revelatory moments at the reader that literally made me gasp aloud several times in public. Yeah, I was that guy in the cafe, voicing his thoughts to bound paper. So it goes.Don't read anything about the plot before picking up the book, not even the back cover if you can help it. In a culture in which movie trailers tell you the whole story before you see the films and book reviews dictate how you should feel about each book before turning to page one, try to go into this one like you're fumbling for a lightswitch in the dark. Wait til you see what's sitting in the room with you when the lights go on.At its core, \"Marriage\" is about the way we live our lives with others, never seeing those people for who they truly are, all along being misunderstood ourselves. But that's just a theme, and themes say nothing about a book really. Sorry, it's a tough book to rave about because ultimately it comes down to my saying, Just trust me. And if you're like me, you don't trust anyone who says Trust me. It's a tangle of thorns we have here."}, {"userName": "Edan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27925-edan", "userReview": "Taking this to Kauai......So I took this on my trip because the plot intrigued me, and because I've been curious about Andrew Sean Greer's work for a long time, and, well, because its shortness pleased me. Weight is always a factor when choosing beach reading, isn't it?Some of the prose here is lovely, although most of the time it strains to be lovely, making it less so. Greer likes to repeat phrases throughout the novel, such as, \"We think we know the ones we love...\" and usually these refrains sounded cheesy and obvious to me. It feels like Greer was nervous his readers wouldn't get the themes of the book, so he felt the need to announce them on every other page, all the while playing the violin and spraying lavender-gardenia-memory perfume in my face. The weirdest thing about this book is that the narrator is a black woman talking about her marriage during the 1950s--but she doesn't reveal herself as a person of color until page 48. I have the feeling that Greer wanted to trick all of us readers who just assume whiteness on characters (how dare I!), and then say, \"Aha! Gotcha!\" It felt like trickery because there are many times in the first 47 pages that she would mention her race, or someone else's, and doesn't. For instance, when an important character first comes to her door, she mentions that he's blonde, not that he is white. Come on! A black woman in the 1950s opens her door and doesn't see race? I don't buy it, and it seems to me a failure in authentic perspective. Greer also has a habit of being cryptic in scene and then making me wait to figure out what's going on. This didn't produce narrative drive, it just made me put the book down and reapply my sunscreen. Let's just say I didn't get sunburned until I started reading other books that caught my attention and kept it there. Overall, the book was an easy read and often the passages about San Francisco in that era were fun, but I didn't understand the narrator's conflict and her motivations. And I even saw the ending coming...and that NEVER happens to me."}, {"userName": "Teresa Proen\u00e7a", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6923777-teresa-proen-a", "userReview": "Pol\u00edtica Guerra Racismo Homossexualidade Casamento Maternidade e, claro, o Amor s\u00e3o os ingredientes principais com que o autor constr\u00f3i uma bonita hist\u00f3ria sobre o mist\u00e9rio que \u00e9 cada ser humano; para os outros e para si pr\u00f3prio.\"Julgamos conhecer aqueles que amamos (...)Pensamos que os conhecemos.

The Story of a Marriage. New York: Picador, 2008.I was attracted to this paperback book because of its cover. I read a couple of pages and the read was decent so I bought it. The entire book was a gentle surprise. I will try another book of his.(41) \u201cIt is the hardest kind of knowledge, not just about another but about ourselves. To see our lives as a fiction we have written and believed. Silence and lies. The sensation I felt that evening \u2013 that I did not know my Holland [husband:], did not know myself, that it was perhaps impossible to know a single soul on earth \u2013 it was a fearful loneliness.\u201d(59) \u201cThe moment, like the smallest gear of a hidden machine, that set our lives in motion.\u201d(87) \u201cHow do you make someone love you? For the very young, there can be nothing harder in the world. You may try as hard as you like: place yourself beside them, cook their favorite food, bring them wine or sing the love songs that you know will move them. They will not move them. Nothing will move them. You will waste days interpreting the simple banalities of a phone call; months staring at their soft lips as they talk; you will waste years watching a body sitting in a chair and willing every muscle to take you across the room and do a simple thing, say a simple word, make them love, and you will not do it; you will waste long nights wondering how they cannot feel this \u2013 the urge to embrace, the snowmelt in the heart when you are near them \u2013 how they can sit in that chair, or speak with those lips, or make a call and mean nothing by it, hide nothing in their hearts. Or perhaps what they hide is not what you want to see. Because surely they love someone. It simply isn\u2019t you.\u201d(137) \u201c\u2026 for we had each done a startling thing, dodged time for an instant \u2013 which is the only definition of happiness I know.\u201d(154) \u201cI have said that pain reveals things, and that is sometimes what it takes to break our solitude. To open, briefly, that small window, that view out of ourselves: the life of someone else.\u201d(171) \u201cIt\u2019s the loss we don\u2019t speak of, losing a friend forever. We call it life; we call it time passing. But it is a kind of heartbreak, like any other.\u201dWhen her kids were little, Carol wondered what her kids would pick from their childhood to remember. I too wondered about that when I had children. Certainly some of the memories would match. But I have found that most of the happenings I orchestrated and hoped they would remember, weren\u2019t. They recall random happenings, things I can\u2019t find in my memories. (172)(175-176)As Pearlie Cook thinks about her husband leaving her and their son, Walter (Sonny) for a man (Buzz), she contemplates the magnitude of it. \u201cI would never meet another man who\u2019d met my mother, who knew her untamable hair, her sharp Kentucky accent, creaked with fury. She was dead now, and no man could ever know her again. That would be missing. I\u2019d never know anyone, anywhere, who\u2019d watched me weeping with rage and lack of sleep in those first months after Sonny was born, or seen his first steps, or listened to him tell his nonsense stories. He was a boy now. No one could ever again know him as a baby. That would be missing, too. I wouldn\u2019t just be alone in the present; I would be alone in my past as well, in my memories\u2026I would be like a traveler from a distant country that no one had ever been to, nor ever heard of, an immigrant from that vanished land\u201d my youth.\u201d(180)\u201dI was prepared for solitude \u2013 even for freedom \u2013 but I was not prepared for this: the abandonment.\u201dOur actions, our choices, look different to those who are not us.

When it came out I was giddy and purchased it from my local bookstore with out hesitation. Then I began reading it and found myself stumbling over the prose, which seemed to be imagining itself as more beautiful, more poetic than it actually was. And I was confused by the narrator, not in a pleasant way but more in a sort of, really... what's happening here? kind of way. This from someone who typically enjoys the slow reveal, Never Let me Go being a great example. Ultimately, the plot was just weird; I found it implausible and thus struggled to give in to the characters and their choices/ actions. There are certainly some descriptive gems in here, and I enjoyed reading about mid-century San Francisco.

Who are we? How do the choices that we make affect the rest of our lives? Fate.... and How could we TRULY EVER know the family + friends that we love?  Most of the time we think that we \"know\" our husbands, wives, girlfriends, parents....But we can't possibly, and never will....everyone has their secrets - and it's interesting to recognize the \"facade\" that everyone puts on going through their daily lives - when so much more monumental, deeper thoughts and actions and desires run through our supposed \"personality\" + being. \"We think we know the ones we love.....\" This story is about a woman and her husband in 1953 and the development of a huge change in their lives brought on by a stange man that comes to their door one day. I can't elaborate too much on the story line because I don't want to give anything away - there are twists + turns that you won't see coming through each chapter - but the main theme remains the same. And now that I have a child of my own - the mystery lives on - we think that we know our PARENTS, but what they did in their youth is so completely different from what we know about them as adults. And our children will think the same about us....Anyway - this book was a \"reader's copy\" given to me by a friend who works in publishing at FSG (Macmillan)....so I don't know when it'll actually be available to the public in a store.

What do we really know about love?\nThis book challenges this question to its very core. Let's go ahead and herald this author for his skilled writing capabilities. That goes without saying. His talent is true but what I want to commend most on is ability to weave a story that is both believable and dramatic. This story attacked me emotionally. It stirred anger and astonishment toward the audacity of these characters and that is a proven sign in my opinion of a good writer. If you've got me up in arms about people who are just a figment of the imagination, you've done your job. But maybe that's not why I was so bothered by this book. I believe the true reason lies within the fact that although this is fiction, it's a story about people we know.. People we've heard about.. Rumors or maybe all of our worst fears, to wake up next to a person whom you've known all your life only to realize, how well do I know this stranger? And what secrets of mine do they really know about me? And is this really love or have they known love before me? Is love a feeling, joyful that you can't live without? Or is love the life that you sacrifice and live in each day. These are the questions surrounding the triangle of Holland, Pearlie and Buzz.Pearlie thought this was her life. This was her marriage until one day a man she never even knew existed, Buzz, walks up to her door and causes her to question everything she thought she knew. Think I just gave you a spoiler? You can never guess this tale. You must read. Without spoiling, I'll say these three statements #1 to entice you in and #2 to get them off my chest. Pearlie was a damn fool!Buzz had some damn nerve!Holland, he silently saw it all, why didn't he give a damn?I'm giving it 3 stars because it was good, I'll give it that but I can't give 5 to a book that pissed me off.

Greer's book is such a novel, and its aching beauty somehow gets even more compelling, and poignant, as it is illuminated by the knowledge the reader has that he's experiencing a very privileged moment just reading those pages. It is, apparently at least, a very simple story, about a married couple, and a third person who might disrupt this marriage - but as usual with great books, what seems simple is actually extremely complex and subtle, because truth always is. It's a novel about love, about family, about a house, about race, about a neighborhood, about a past era, about war, about the mysteries of the human soul: it's all this, in a deeply ambitious way, but also with humility, without fake literary pretensions, but written with amazing literary skills. That's one of things that makes this novel stand out: It is written with exquisite grace, and such depth and understanding of the heart that it's hard not to be moved and thankful for such beautiful prose. Tender and heartbreaking, Greer's book captures like few others the atmosphere of a specific time as well as the delicate intricacies of lives bound by love. In its own quiet, poetic, discreet way, The Story of Marriage book is a masterpiece.

I didn't realize that it was going to be about the struggles of being homosexual in the 1950's. Not that it wasn't interesting to learn that people were prosecuted and jailed for homosexual acts-I had no idea.The story is narrated by Pearlie Cook, who is married to Holland, described as a beautiful man. Prior to her marriage to Holland, his aunts tell her not to marry him because he has a weak heart. Of course, she doesn't listen to them and marries Holland anyway. She painstakingly does everything she can to create the most soothing home environment possible, for his heart, including snipping articles that may be upsetting from the paper before he has a chance to read it. Several years into the marriage a long, lost friend from the war, named Charles Drumer, shows up on their doorstep. Holland has a peculiar reaction to his friends presence, but Pearlie brushes it off. As time goes by, we learn that the Charles is actually an old lover of Holland's and he wants him back. Pearlie is quite upset by this, but Charles offers her whatever she wants if she will relinquish her hold on Holland.Pearlie does not feel she can talk to Holland about this issue and she does not even make an attempt to discuss his desires. Pearlie agrees to let Holland leave with Charles and start a new life with Charles, unbeknownst to Holland. I'm sure discussing previous homosexual behaviors with her husband would have been a tough subject to discuss, but none the less this was a pretty serious mistake on Pearlie's part. If she had talked to him, she would've found out that he wanted to stay with her and there son and she would not have been so agonized.This is an interesting read that deals with inter-racial relationships, homosexuality and the effects of war in the 1950's."}, {"userName": "Oscar", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1754850-oscar", "userReview": "Andrew Sean Greer es un gran escritor, sutil, sencillo, delicado, contenido y evocador.

I wanted to love this book, but I just got more and more irritated with every page. My disbelief was not the least bit suspended as Greer wrote Pearlie up into a dull, unquestioning, easy to manipulate, passive Black housewife who was tricked time and time again by a manipulative, rich, white, gay male wizard. I kept asking myself if I'd be responding to the novel differently if a woman of color had written it, but I just couldn't imagine that the story and characterization could even exist if a white man hadn't written it. Initially, I picked up the novel because I'd read in reviews that the setting was the Sunset District of SF in the 1950s, and I was interested in the historical detail of the city in which I live. There's lots of it, for sure, but the novel felt self-conscious in this regard. I imagined ASG with lists of household items (razor dispensers in medicine cabinets) and long-gone locales (Playland at the Beach) and fashionable attire (foldable hats) that he wanted to weave into his story (all of them interesting, for sure), and I also felt the trudging of his heavy hand as he attempted to fit those researched details into his plot in a seamless fashion.That said, I kept turning the pages and read the novel quickly and eagerly so that I could see how the train wreck came out. The novel is readable, a bit mysterious, and seems to have its heart in the right place.

Sono mezzucci di poco conto in un romanzo che ha, evidentemente, l'ambizione di spingere l'acceleratore sul versante dell'indagine psicologica.Troppe belle frasi infilate \"ad effetto\" e spesso tra loro contraddittorie. Sicuramente, questo libro \u00e8 una pacchia per gli amanti degli aforismi, che, al contrario, io detesto, perch\u00e9, in fondo, finiscono per non significare proprio niente. In pratica, frasi per tutte le stagioni, paragonabili al genere \u201cnon c\u2019\u00e8 pi\u00f9 la mezza stagione\u201d, frasi costruite a tavolino, tra l\u2019altro del tutto inappropriate in bocca a Pearlie, che non poteva, proprio per come \u00e8 stata tratteggiata dall\u2019autore, neanche vagamente pensarle.Buono, ma molto carente il punto di vista degli obiettori di coscienza, che si va stemperando in vigliaccheria, senza per\u00f2 riuscire ad esprimerne efficacemente la differenza.Troppo blando, ma ci pu\u00f2 stare, il tratteggio storico dell\u2019epoca. Se visto con gli occhi di Pearlie e dei mezzi a sua disposizione, \u00e8 anche credibile.Troppo moderno, rapportato all'epoca, l'impatto con la presunta omosessualit\u00e0 di Holland e Buzz.Assolutamente scontato il finale. Questa non \u00e8 la storia di un matrimonio, \u00e8 solo storia di sei mesi \u201canomali\u201d (e qualche volta poco credibili) di un matrimonio. Qual \u00e8, dunque, il lato positivo? Beh, a mio modesto avviso, il lato positivo \u00e8 il silenzio dell\u2019oggetto del desiderio, ossia Holland. Parlano tutti, tutti quanti esprimono opinioni: Pearlie, le zie di Holland, Buzz, Sonny, chiunque conosca Holland \u2026 ma l\u2019unico che tace \u00e8 lui.

It has earned a great many accolades, including earning a place on several Best Book of the Year lists, and such rave reviews as:\"Bewitching ... A book whose linguistic prowess ad raw storytelling power is almost disruptive to the reader. It's too good to put down and yet each passage is also too good to leave behind.\"Deborah Vankin, Los Angeles TimesAndKhaled Housseini: \"a book about love, and it is a marvel to watch Greer probe the mysteries of love to such devastating effect.\"And\"A beautiful, lyrical novel ... a book full of urgent questions.\"O, The Oprah Magazine, Recommended Summer Reading.The Story of a Marriage is a love triangle. It is 1953. Pearlie Cook, a young African American housewife, \"lives in the Sunset District in San Francisco, [and is] caring not only for her husband's fragile health, but also for her son, who is afflicted with polio.\" Enter Buzz, a former soldier, like her husband, Holland, and her husband's wartime lover, and Buzz wants Holland back. Yes, clearly there are urgent questions that each must ask and attempt to answer. And Greer's writing is beautiful and lyrical, and he is probing the mysteries of love, as Holland, Pearlie, and Buzz make the painful and necessary decisions to go on with their lives.So, why did I only give this two stars? I did so because I wasn't convinced; I wanted more answers to these questions. I wanted to understand why Holland makes the choice he does, and why Pearlie accepts it and why Buzz does as well. Yes, the mysteries of the human heart are many, and maybe that is the point: some questions can only be asked. Any answers must be understand as a life is lived. I also wanted more passion. Greer is a thoughtful, intelligent writer. Here, I felt the need for a greater sense of the passion, and the pain for these people. There was, for me, an odd flatness. True, Pearlie tells her story as one who is looking back and trying to make sense of the different choices made-some detachment seems inevitable and natural. But pain and passion do survive in memory.But the front pages are filled with critical praise. Sometimes individual readers differ."}, {"userName": "Kp", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1633650-kp", "userReview": "The writing and the plot structure of this book are great. I love the way the author unravels the story slowly, slowly like a ball of yarn so that you can't really see what's in the middle or at the heart of it until the first layers have been unraveled. It keeps the reader wondering - just enough to be interesting, but not so much so that it's confusing. So I really ended up enjoying listening to the story to find out how all the loose ends would come together. I had a problem with the plot, however, in that the major event of the story or the major question of the story (Trying not to give anything away, I'll just say, \"Will Holland leave?\") could have been avoided if the main characters, either one of them, had ever talked to each other about that question. It seems implausible to me that the whole 6 months of events could take place, and especially that last night, without even ONE WORD about it. And this between a married couple who, basically, had a fairly good marriage. I know Holland seemed like he was about to bring it up several times, but why wouldn't he? It just made it seem a little ridiculous to me. And I know the author repeated several times the theme of, \"You never truly know your partner... \" etc. I still just didn't buy that they never talked about that important question. And, evidently, until years AFTER the event, he never even knew that his wife didn't WANT him to leave. huh? The other problem I had with the book is that for some reason I couldn't connect too well with the three main characters. I felt a LOT more connected in this author's last book, The Confessions of Max Tivoli, than in this one. I still enjoyed the whole experience a lot, so I gave it the 3 stars :)"}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3680008-michael", "userReview": "The one thing that pulled me into this book was the first page. Now if you can grab me from the first page, then you already have my immediate attention. As far as the story, let's just say that it is no mistaking that Andrew is a talented writer. The way he writes flawed characters is a gift that no one can take away. Especially since this is my first book I read by him, anxious to read more of his works.Pearlie in my opinion was a na\u00efve woman. I felt like she tried to keep her composure even after finding out about her husband trials. At first I thought that she was justified sticking by her man. However I quickly got annoyed with her explaining what a marriage was and what a marriage was not. The beginning of the story was great, loved how she got introduced to him when they were little and how they progressed into adults. There was one line in the story that I loved was \"Let me take care of you.\" The line may be simple to some but I think that was a pivotal part in the story. Mainly because everyone around her was trying to convince her not to marry. Yet her love for him prompted her not to do that.In contrast, some characters were plainly irrelevant. If the story solely focused on Pearlie and her husband than the rating would have changed drastically. Instead I got annoyed with the other characters, regardless of how little or important they were. Lastly, I really love how the story was written(HUGE PLUS!). Pearlie clearly knew her husband in her own perception but the last page seemed like she did not know him at all.Three stars for a solid effort, good characterization but poor execution."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1531553-sara", "userReview": "\u201cHolland and I had talked about our friends and our childhoods and movies and books and politics\u2014we had agreed and disagreed and had our fights and merry moments over a beer\u2014but I think it\u2019s fair to say we had never spoken honestly in all ours lives.\u201d This quote from A Story of a Marriage by Andrew Sean Greer prettily sums up the story\u2019s central conflict. The narrator, Pearlie a young mother and wife to her high school sweetheart, Holland grapples with her marriage in 1950\u2019s San Francisco.

In fact the book\u2019s only draw back is its brevity as its simple prose endears readers page by page. It\u2019s an unconventional love story written with graceful restraint and vibrant characters.

In fewer than 200 pages, Andrew Sean Greer weaves the story of a marriage in crisis with delicacy, finesse and the prose of an angel. I loved his evocation of San Francisco's Sunset district in the 1950's. But even more than that I loved his ability to capture the mystery at the heart of the book's central relationship. I read it in just two sittings, and was sad when I had finished it.It's the kind of novel that reminds you why it is we read novels in the first place. I am consciously withholding that fifth star because, although I liked the story very much indeed, one of the main protagonists (Holland, the husband) was never developed in any depth and remained a somewhat puzzling cipher throughout. Nonetheless, reading 'The Story of a Marriage' was a great pleasure - all the more so because I knew nothing about it beforehand."}, {"userName": "Licha", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5614272-licha", "userReview": "Really disliked this book. I wanted to stop this several times but my OCD would not let me. I had high hopes that some big reveal would come along. And two big reveals did come around page 40, but after that nothing more. I didn't quite get what this was about, even after the big reveal. None of the characters were anyone you'd like to know more about and indeed, the author never goes into explaining what they think, what motivates them, what bonds them together. It all sums up to not caring what happens to any of them, one way or the other. The time period, which the author made to be as much of an important element to the plot, felt fake. And I'm sorry, but what wife actually clips out all bad news from her husband's paper to protect his weak heart?

The choice of point of view is perfect, since the whole of the mystery moves around Pearlie and that placement is what makes it a mystery. The twists are gently introduced, even elegantly, but I have some doubts on two of them that I shall probably be working through in the next month. Still these questions are balanced by other passages of lyric statement that only hint at another intelligence behind the narrator. And yet, she is capable of the thoughts and images in them, if not necessarily the words. As the narrator says: it is seldom that one says the right thing when it's needed to make a difference."}, {"userName": "Virginia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26781332-virginia", "userReview": "Crediamo tutti di conoscere la persona che amiamo.Nostro marito, nostra moglie.
