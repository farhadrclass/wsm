I'm honestly sorry that I ever read that first book (which I got free somehow?). I remember being annoyed at the spelling of the main character's name, \"Faythe.\" I should have stopped then.The way the plot wound up, for the most part, had no real surprises. Anybody who has followed the series has to have figured out what was going to happen by now. It's been foreshadowed - heck, shouted from the rooftops.No, my disappointment is in the way the damned romance thing was handled. If you've bothered to read this but haven't read the series, I'm surprised. Anyway, we have a classic love triangle between Faythe, Marc, and Jace. The setting is supposed to be current day America with a twist - the characters are werecats, part of a hidden subculture.We all know that mainstream Americans are supposedly monogamous but more serially monogamous and closet - something - in practice. Anyway, werecat society is fiercely monogamous. Females are rare, and they're supposed to hit puberty, get married, and produce the next generation with their One True Love. Period. No other options.So Faythe has defied tradition so far. She went to college. Good for her! She had a boyfriend there. Even better! A non-Pride boyfriend. Great! (To my way of thinking, not her subculture's). She left her guy, Marc, standing at the altar to do all that, though. Eww - not classy. But after she goes back home, she gets back together with Marc. Hmph. Then she \"connects\" with Jace. That means \"has sex with.\" Ooo, bad idea, since she was in a committed relationship with Marc at the time. Very bad idea. But Oh, They were Grieving! Together! For her brother and his best friend, who had just been treacherously killed by enemies! So of course the way to do that, instead of talking about their memories of him, is to roll around naked in the middle of a public room, right?Um, not the way I'd do it, but, apparently that's their way. They do their grieving with a lot more alcohol than I would too, though.They don't get caught, at least - not then. No, an enemy figures it out due to how the three interact, and tells Marc, and he believes the enemy (because everybody believes enemies over allies in the heat of battle). And they're all too immature to put the crap behind them and just deal with the fact that they're in the middle of a \"war,\" too.I kept wanting to spank all of them, and it wasn't because I found any of them sexy.I did hope, at first, that bringing Jace in as a love interest - and Faythe does repeat, over and over and over again, that she loves Jace, that it wasn't \"just sex\" - might mean that there was hope for some sort of surprise in the end of the book. That would have been nice, right? Something of a twist that didn't lead to an unhappy ending? I would have loved to see that!She's going to be the first female Alpha, so why not the first Alpha with two husbands? She'll be the first Alpha who has to deal with pregnancy, so why not have one husband to protect her while she's pregnant and another to get deal with what has to be done in person? What a concept?My hope was buoyed by the fact that Vincent deliberately developed Jase as a decent potential partner, showing him taking care of Faythe well when she's injured, supporting her as she would need to be supporting when she takes over the Pride as Alpha, and working well with Marc and others repeatedly.Marc, on the other hand, is a jerk, slamming doors, stomping around, and doing everything but pissing on the furniture to mark his territory.Just once, I want to see a hero or heroine walk away when someone says, \"I cant live without you!\" I want to see someone say, \"Whoa - that's WAY unhealthy, babe! You need THERAPY!\"Instead, Faythe's father tells her to \"Choose the one you can't live without.\" UGH. Thanks, Daddy! Codependent much?Do I think she chose the wrong Tom? Absolutely. But - she's a spoiled brat, and she chose a jealous ass. They deserve each other. Let the sweet, loving man go find the sweet, loving woman he deserves. Hopefully he'll stop the drunken escapades and keep it in his pants from now on. Maybe Kaci will grow up to be his Tabby?Anyway, there you have it.

I wondered about his decision to train Faythe as his successor. Was it a sound decision? What leadership skills did he see in Faythe? Throughout most of the series, Faythe\u2019s decisions often seemed misguided and impulsive. I know many readers were put off by her attitude and some did not continue reading this excellent series. In Alpha, Faythe begins to shine. I understood Greg\u2019s choice of leader and Faythe was the logical successor. Yes, Faythe still made some stupid, angsty choices in her love life \u2013 we\u2019ll get to that later \u2013 but she fought with determination for her Pride and for the benefit of all werecats, Pride or Strays. I loved many things about this book but the father-daughter moments were my favorites. I was touched when Faythe confessed to her father and spoke to him about her relationship woes. Greg helped Faythe understand the repercussions of her decision. Faythe\u2019s relationship triangle angst drove me bonkers. I\u2019m not really a fan of the love triangle. I love Marc. Jace always struck me as a bit of an opportunist. (Now you all know which side I\u2019m on). I hated how Faythe strung both men along, putting her decision off. This aspect of the book really bothered me because Faythe\u2019s inability to choose made her seem weak and immature. Faythe\u2019s father said it best: \u201dYou have to choose. You cannot make decisions for the rest of them if you can\u2019t make this one for yourself.\u201dI enjoyed the inclusion of the Thunderbirds in this book. Faythe\u2019s negotiation with the Thunderbirds was a highlight for me. It provided some insight into the Thunderbirds mystical culture. Alpha is an intense read. It is filled with action and a lot of violence. At times, the grief and sadness made me go through a lot of tissues. At times, it felt as if Faythe and the Pride would not be able to overcome their obstacles. I felt frustration and despair as Cal continued with his dirty tricks, staying one step ahead of Faythe. I did find the violence level quite high with Faythe getting beaten almost to the point of death. For a society that values its females of childbearing age, I really was surprised how many times Faythe was attacked or beaten. I\u2019m sad that the series is over. It ended well. All the right decisions were made. I wish there was more. Maybe Ms. Vincent could write about some of the other werecats? A book about the Thunderbirds would be interesting, or maybe Kellar? Favorite quote: \"This place is like a scary, furry soap opera.\"Update 8/3/12 - We've highlighted this series in our Sucker for a Series feature on Badass Book Reviews.

From anger to anxiety, fear to hatred, joy to love, pain to healing, and everything in between\u2026 It was all there and in spades. I must first say I balled my eyes out at least three times and felt my heart break at least six, so be prepared. Yes, you read that right. At least six times. Three of those were for each Faythe, Marc and Jace. Obviously, the love triangle will be a major concern with most readers. As I know it was a huge reason why I tried reading into every little tidbit that concerned the trio. This was probably the only situation I had some small bits of concern. Again, not much I can say without spoilers, but I was happy, disappointed, resolved, and then happy again. You do not know how bad I want to comment on the finality of this triangle, but I fear it may be the main result everyone is waiting on. This isn't giving anything away, but I loved it nonetheless. \"..there's never been anyone for me but you. Not in my bed, not in my life, and not in my heart. And there never will be.\"I felt every emotion and action Faythe was experiencing and wanted all the revenge & bloodshed, love & comfort she deserved with every single turn of the page. You cannot believe how great I felt when the blood finally started to spill, but none of it was without consequences. Just as every action demands recompense in some way, it is not always in the form we would like. As it is proven repeatedly throughout this entire series, though none more than in this final book. Hope. Finally, there are great things to look forward to. I mean, there was so much hope in the end that I cannot help but be greedy and wish there were another 2+ books to continue with all the possibilities they could encompass. But alas, we will have to figure out the details of how this world continues on our own. (Barring some miracle Rachel announces she will continue in a spin-off!) However, I say the hope is enough to keep me feeling great about the final words splayed out over the last pages."}, {"userName": "Erin \u2615 *Proud Book Hoarder*", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3048260-erin-proud-book-hoarder", "userReview": "\u201cHe went down like a cheerleader after prom.\u201d Unfortunately while the series starting improving in the middle, it fell apart again at the end. I wanted to kill half the characters in this book myself, on both the good and bad side.This book was supposed to be the wrap-up all the other stories was leading to - and we do get to see more internal power struggles with the annoying council I want to choke. There weren't really surprises with the decisions and outcome since it was already to us in previous books who would vote for whom. Even if the final book holds no surprises, there are some crucial events that happened - a few fights, Faythe actually loses a few things for a change, a major death, and of course an ending that I expected.I don't care how good, bad, or average the storyline is - it was hampered a lot because Faythe was incredibly irritating. I've said in previous reviews that her smug attitude came across bitchy rather than heroic, and she does sometimes make things worse for herself. I can understand her temper here, but the main issue I hold now is her constant whining about feeling lonely by her two men because they're keeping distance from her. Yeah, she feels bad about her betrayal and the 'luv triangle', but the author kept showing the character with a broken heart and moaning how much she needed someone. It even goes as far where she has to have conversations with her parents about it separately, then her brother, and anyone who would listen. I kept expecting one of them to finally say, well, what'd you expect??It was beyond trashy for her to allow a kiss to happen in the room next to the alphas meeting when they all know what's been going on and the situation is already hostile, especially with the other half of the love triangle sitting outside. Her brushing it off as needing someone is never an excuse to act like that, I hold no sympathy with that scene.Then there was the annoying problem where she kept thinking to herself that she can't choose, she can't lose them both - and we have to hear other characters randomly bring this up to her too. There is a major character death and he used dying advice to tell her how important it is to 'choose' her love triangle. Really? Really? It's not small potatoes but is the stupid decision elevated to that importance, for last dying words!?!Sigh: \u201cI want you. I want you so badly I can\u2019t stand it. When you left, it felt like the world got darker. Like I couldn\u2019t truly see anything. Couldn\u2019t feel anything.\u201d It makes little sense to me she'd start having heartbreak and panic attacks before major war fights or in these emergencies because of her hormonal cravings. The end makes sense of her choice, I guess, but it's not surprising. All that build up was wasted, there was no point to this love triangle through the last books, except perhaps to irritate me.It doesn't help that I no longer really feel romantic attachments to any of the characters. Their relationships are just kind of there but I'm not feeling it.The major death was a sad blow since it was a favorite character of mine. I saw it coming a mile off and figured before picking this up that it would be the case, but it was still difficult. The author wrote the grieving scenes convincingly well and isn't the type who dismisses loss easily.I was happy to see the Thunderbirds return for brief stints - they're fierce and vicious but the ending was awesome with their inclusion.Overall I had too many issues to rate this book higher than 3 stars - the good rating was earned because of the wrap-up being well done for important plot points and decent battles, but there were plenty of problems to endure."}, {"userName": "Pam Nelson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15402332-pam-nelson", "userReview": "5 Alpha Stars What an OUTSTANDING Series! I love it so hard! This book had me crying!!! I mean that\u2019s not really a big surprise but crying people. I was happy and sad and happy and sad. This book put me through so many emotions.

I literally jumped up and down when I got the chance of getting this book early and I was more than thrilled when I got in my email box. I stopped everything I was doing and just started reading it right then and there. Less than a day later I am here writing this review of the closing book of one of my favorite series ever and it could not be more bittersweet. \u201cBeing Alpha was a burden and an enormous responsibility, not a license to push people around. And That was what Calvin Malone had never really understood.\u201dAlpha starts not long after the events in Shifter and Faythe\u2019s Pride is getting ready to go to the Pride Council meeting, where they will vote on the new Head honcho. But before Greg, Faythe, Jace, Marc and some enforcers can go, they are preparing for a visit from Ethan\u2019s human and pregnant girlfriend, Angela. The whole family is nervous and hoping to make a good impression so Angela will let them be part of the baby\u2019s life. It was a great beginning to the novel and really emotional. \u201c'I can't help that. I love him, but I can live without him. I can't live without you, ****. Please don't ask me to.'\u201dA lot happens during the Pride Council meeting and more than once we get to see Faythe\u2019s life get thrown around for a loop. But, It also awesome to see how much Faythe has grown and evolved from Stray, not to mention that it is always fun to witness her kicking some serious butt. I really don\u2019t want to give away any spoilers, but I\u2019ll give some tips of things to come: *NOT too spoilery, I promise!We get to see the Thunderbirds again We get to see Elias Keller again (he is so awesome!) I cried like a baby more than once =/ Faythe does make a choice between Jace and Marc And the blood shed is far from overI hope I didn\u2019t give too much away, but I have to say that this book was all shades of amazing. I could not put it down for a second and every line of it kept me on the edge of my seat and hanging on to every word Rachel put on paper. If I have one bad thing to say about this novel is that I wanted more, I wanted to see further in Faythe\u2019s future at the end, but that in no way stole away from my reading pleasure and just like real life, the end made it clear that even though the series / the storytelling is over, Faythe and the Pride\u2019s life goes on\u2026 Alpha is a wonderful end to an extraordinary series that will be missed immensely in the Urban Fantasy world. Rachel Vincent brought something new to the table with the shifters series and she stole a piece of my heart with every single one of these books. If you have yet to give this series a chance, don\u2019t waste another second and pick up the first 5 books on it to get ready for the release of Alpha, you will not regret it!"}, {"userName": "Cat Russell  (Addicted2Heroines)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4250664-cat-russell-addicted2heroines", "userReview": "First I want to share one of the sexiest moments in literary history . . \"This isn't about you....\"\"Well, it should be!\" he shouted, and I flinched.

He's everything I want in a man (minus the enormous, furry cat claws).This book was amazing! . . . Let me say it again - amazing, amazing, amazing! The stories are so ridiculously emotional and nerve-racking that it literally had my stomach in knots. Vincent is the only author who can make me forget that the main character is going to prevail in the end. I honestly thought that at any moment Faythe or Marc would die even when logic tells me it's not realistic. But I must say, Vincent has no shame in killing off well liked characters. It's a bold move and I am ashamed to admit that I cried twice during this series (but if you tell anyone that, I will deny it). I wasn't sobbing or anything. I just teared up and a few of them escaped, so don't think less of me, okay?If you don't enjoy love triangles, and you have to be insane not to, then avoid this series. Faythe, Marc and Jace make up one of the best love triangles that I've read about in a long time.

The plot was fast-paced and kept me guessing. The tension between the characters was emotional and angsty, and I don't just mean the Marc-Faythe-Jace triangle. The situation with Ryan, the relationship between Holly and Michael, the relationship between Faythe and her father, the moments between Vic and Faythe - all were so very well-written. And as much as I hate to focus on Marc-Faythe-Jace so much, they were the central story to this series, in one way or another.Faythe and company are still dealing with the revelation from the last book, when Marc found out about Jace. This was the driving emotional point of this book. When the book begins, Marc is very angry and still humiliated by Faythe's choices. It is my opinion that Faythe deserved to suffer for what she wrought. It was painful to read, but Marc really handed it to her.\"Hell, yeah, I want you to pay! I want you both to pay. How am I supposed to look at you after you've been with him? I'm in the right here, Faythe. You screwed up - you screwed him - and I'm the one paying for it.\"Marc was, in my opinion, absolutely in the right here. I have no sympathy for Faythe's fateful decision. Marc is the one that Faythe has toyed with since she was 16. She dated him, left him at the alter, came back to him and won him back, won him back again, and then screwed his subordinate because she was drunk and miserable. Argghhh. This annoyed me to no end.\"This isn't about you...\"\"Well, it should be?,\" he shouted. \"Everything I do is about you, and I want the reverse to be true, too. What, you need a reminder? That's what he was doing, right? And now you smell like him. You probably taste like him. You should taste like me.\" I love that Faythe's father didn't push her into a decision based on politics. Greg was very open with Faythe, and gave her the best advice a father could give a daughter.\"Don't confuse the issue by trying to figure out who loves you the most, or who needs you the most. In the end, it only comes down to one thing: choosing the one you can't live without.\" Jace kind of redeemed himself at the end. And I really couldn't blame him. Jace knew that Faythe and Marc had such a rich history, but he had to fight for his own happiness and I respect him for that. However, he was very opportunistic. At one point, my jaw fell open at this exchange with Marc at the Sanders' enforcer's house:\"I am not leaving you alone with her. Here.\" Where Jace and I had...connected. On the living room floor.Jace rolled brilliant blue eyes. \"Like I'm gonna hit on her while she's upset.\"\"If memory serves, that's when she's most...receptive,\" Marc spat. Hey Jace - in case you forgot, you DID hit on her when she was upset. Otherwise, you might not have gotten in her pants. At least not while Marc was being held captive.Of course, this \"furry soap opera\" is taking place at the lodge in Montana where Greg Sanders and his allied alphas are trying to politically solve the problem between them and Cal Malone's pride. While trying to avoid a fight and a loss of life, Cal's minions arrested Faythe, Marc and Jace, and a fight occurred where we see the loss of Greg Sanders and the elevation of Faythe to Pride Alpha. The scenes where Greg died were the most difficult for me to read. It was heartbreaking to see him go, and heartwarming to see the faith and love he placed in her daughter.Faythe and company seem to lose every battle they fight in this story. I was half-convinced that the South Central Pride wasn't going to make it. Rachel Vincent kept me guessing throughout this entire book. There were times when I thought there was no way Faythe was going to regain her Pride land, or that she was going to choose between Marc and Jace. And Faythe still didn't make a choice between the two men in her life, until push came to shove.\"I hate knowing you want him to touch you. And I hate it even worse knowing that there's more to it than that. If you want him more than you want me, just fucking tell me and get it over with. We don't even know if we're all going to live through the fight, and I don't want to die without knowing whether you love me as much as I love you.\" And with that, Marc made his best decision since he found out about Faythe and Jace. After Marc left, it was immediately clear that Faythe couldn't survive without him. She was so enraged that she physically lashed out against Jace. The scenes leading up to and following Marc's exit were some of my favorite in this series. Faythe couldn't even contemplate a life without Marc. She took him for granted and couldn't see that Marc meant business this time. She even made the comment that she didn't believe him because he'd dumped her before but had always came back to her. I especially loved the scene between Vic and Faythe where he laid it all out for her. And Vic is absolutely correct. She didn't even attempt to cut Jace out her life in his role as lover.\"I can't help loving Jace.\"\"Maybe not.\" Vic conceded. \"But you didn't even try. You didn't love Marc enough to even try living without Jace.\" I think Jace's exit was graceful, and I have high hopes that he went back to Kentucky and took over his father's Pride. I think Jace knew he lost Faythe long before he left. From the moment Marc left Faythe, it was obvious to me that Marc was the one she couldn't live without. I didn't like how she kissed Jace, though, before he left. I know - it was difficult, he was leaving for good, blah, blah, blah. But then she turned around and kissed Marc, immediately after, and tells Marc that she still loves Jace. I didn't find that as heartwarming as I think it was meant to be. But the warm fuzzies took over with her last speech to Marc. \"I want you to stay. The Pride needs you, but I'd be lying if I said that has anything to do with this. Stay for me. Stay with me. there will never be anyone else. Not in my bed. Not in my life. And not in my heart.\" I'm so happy I finally read this series. I don't want Rachel Vincent to revisit this at any time. I don't think I could take any more of an emotional roller coaster ride with Faythe and Marc. What a great series! The love story, the angst, the political maneuverings, the relationships, the world building, the characters - everything about this series as a whole was just fantastic. I look very forward to reading Vincent's other work."}, {"userName": "valee", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2320890-valee", "userReview": "OMG! I just can't believe it is really over. I feel like crying because I really don't want this amazing series to end. I still have this lovely dream where Rachel Vincent comes and tells me not to worry because the best spin off ever is coming, and with all this amazing characters in it so we wont have to miss it this much. Why does it have to end? I love this series so much! But I guess that's what made this author get so high in my ranking, she knew when exactly to finish the series and how to tide every loose end. She didn't keep writing books in it till we got bored, no, she finished it in it's best moment, and that's what makes this author such a terrific writer IMHO.I don't even know where to start. Definitely not talking about the plot as there are already hundreds of reviews that do that. I'll start by saying that this has been one the best Urban Fantasy series I have read. Yes, that's just about it, no doubts about that statement I just made. I know many of you know how obsessed I am with other UF series but it's not the same. Usually my favs in UF have much romance in it, like guild hunters or night huntress series, and I am a huge fan of romance. I never, ever enjoy a series if it has not romance in it. This was the first time. Because let's be clear, the romance department in this series is almost null. So then how could I have enjoyed this series so much?It was all about the plot. It was so well developed that it was amazing how real it felt. And that's what was best about this series, no huge super powers or hypothetical situations, it just felt like a were-cat would come any minute and scare the shit out of you any moment,lol. The best thing about this series is that it makes you really love it for being Urban Fantasy, not for the romance, not for the characters, but for the plot, that's what you will love the most about this series.I loved this series so much! And it's going to be extremely hard to say goodbye. If any of you have not read it yet, please do if you trust my taste at all, I promise you'll love it! Even though I must admit that books 1 and 2 were very slow and never made me thought this would become on of the best series I read.I don't even wanna stop writing the review because I know it will be the final closure to this amazing series! I'm so sad! LOL. Please of of you who have not read it yet, let me know everything you think about it once you do. I'll go to the shifters group now and share my sadness with others that feel the same way, *sigh*."}, {"userName": "Francesca the Fierce (Under the Covers Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3108364-francesca-the-fierce-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "This review was posted at Under The Covers.What an amazing ending to this series!!! This book was excellent! Coming from someone who struggled a bit through the first 2 books, and was encouraged to continue (a little) with the third!Ms. Vincent has done a great job with world-building throughout this series, the plots of each book are always interesting, keep you on your toes, and they've been laid out so well, it's almost like watching a movie!The characters are all great! I was never a Faythe lover, well, let's face it, in the beginning of this series I HATED Faythe. She was just so immature and Ms. Spoiled-Princess, and I almost gave up on the series for that reason alone. But now I can honestly say I've enjoyed seeing her grow! I really can't believe it's only been a year (timeline of the series) since she was called back from and away from college and her human life. In that year, she has experienced love, loss, action, drama, betrayal. She's had to face rogue werecats, get kidnapped, almost raped, faced the Council, and through all that she's developed a backbone and she's just grown up!From book 4 there's a series of events that unfold and are left unresolved until now... Calvin Malone, power hungry bad guy is still making everyone's lives a mess. Faythe is still not sure about her feelings for Marc and Jace.I don't want to give anything away... This book can only be enjoyed if you avoid ALL spoilers. Believe me, it'll keep you on your toes, you just have to know what happens next.I am extremely satisfied with how things finished and how everything was handled. The last 3 books have been an extremely emotional rollercoaster ride. Make sure you have the kleenex ready for all 3 of them. They are gut-wrenchingly emotional! I loved them! I highly recommend this series now!!!!"}, {"userName": "Sheri", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3772786-sheri", "userReview": "I'm reviewing this series as a whole rather than each individual book. Overall, this was a great series. Lots of action, fast paced, and very entertaining. The only thing I didn't like about it was the lead, Faythe. Since she is obviously a huge part of the book, that might have been enough to turn me off of the books altogether. However, the rest of the story and characters made up for what irked me about her. First of all, she was supposed to be all tough and kick ass, but she came across as childish and selfish. Her whole spiel was that she wanted to be independent and to be able to make her own decisions. However, she never made any decisions. She is the most indecisive person ever! And, the independent decisions she did make always got her or someone else in trouble, so she would have to sit around wait for the big, strong male to come save her whiny ass. So much for a kick ass female lead. Second, she was always jumping to these huge conclusions about what had happened or what was going to happen that didn't make any sense and had no factual base to them, and yet they were always somehow the right conclusions. Seriously, she had to have been part psychic. But all that conclusion jumping (and there was s lot of it going on) made the story lose some credibility for me.However, if you just want werecat entertainment without a strong female lead, go ahead and enjoy these books. I did :) All I need to know now is...when does Jace get a book??"}, {"userName": "Joanne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2084265-joanne", "userReview": "Power, revenge, and justice - prepare yourself for the final battle! In the final chapter of \"The Shifters Series\", Faythe and her Pride must fight a tyrannical werecat intent on taking over the territorial council, and the south-central Pride in particular. It's down to Faythe to take on the role of Alpha before she feels completely ready for the job. Forced to rise to the occasion, Faythe must balance experience, advice, and the urge for vengeance. She must also finally choose between Marc and Jace...No decisions will be is easy, and not everyone will survive this epic fight to the death. From Amazon UKAs the final book in the Shifters series, I was really looking forward to reading Alpha yet not at the same time. I'd get to find out all the answers to the questions left over from previous books, but I'd also have to say goodbye to Faythe, Marc, Jace, and everyone else. Now I've finished it, I can only say this: what an amazing way to end the series!All those ends get tied up; we find out who ends up being the head of the territorial council, we find out who Faythe chooses between Marc and Jace, and we find out the outcome of the war. And I can't tell you how amazing it is! I actually think \"amazing\" is a bit of an understatement.What I loved most about this book is the politics. Alpha is as action packed as all the other books in the series, but it also has a lot of decision making, organising, strategising, and a lot of Faythe having to use her head. But it's not all plain sailing. Vincent drops stumbling block after stumbling block in Faythe's path, causing her to re-think, re-group, restart. Faythe's strength in such impossible situations is incredible, especially when you consider the emotional turmoil she's also under.Marc and Jace find it difficult to wait for Faythe to make her mind up over who she wants, and what's so difficult is she loves them both so much. There are a few times throughout the novel when one or the other's reactions to certain events made me think I knew who Faythe would end up choosing, but then wonder if they were just red-herrings, so I was never really sure who would end up being Faythe's guy. I won't say whether I was happy or not with who she ended up choosing, because that may give it away, but I will say it was emotional and heart-wrenching to read Faythe try and make a decision.There were a few other emotional events throughout the book that would have left me in floods of tears if it weren't for the fact that I was at work at the time and couldn't be unprofessional. No-one writes such excruciating scenes like Vincent. The agony that these characters go through emotionally is just so raw, it's literally painful to read.The action in this book is just phenomenal. Really. The war is just terrifying in that everything is happening so fast in so many places, you don't know who's hurt, who's dead, who's alive. Having read the previous books in the series, I know that violence and gore are to be expected, but Alpha takes it to a completely new level. I didn't think I could be shocked by the violence that I read, or by the actions of some of the disgustingly evil antagonists, but I was, time and time again.But now it's finished. I closed the book feeling extremely happy with how the story ended, but so, so sad that that was it. That there would be no more from Faythe and her family. I get so emotionally involved in books, and in this series especially, that I actually feel that friends have died. I finished reading right before going to bed, and I laid there not sleeping for ages, not being able to get the story out of my head. As sad as it may sound, I miss them all already.This is not a book to be missed! It might possibly be my favourite of the series. Vincent has far surpassed my expectations, and my awe of her has no limit, it seems. An incredible finale from an incredible author. I seriously cannot wait to see what adult series Vincent brings us next.From Once Upon a Bookcase - YA book blog."}, {"userName": "Cindi", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1940550-cindi", "userReview": "Well, Faythe's story has come to an end with this book, and I have to say it was a wild ride! I started this series thinking, no, knowing that she was self-absorbed and challenging her Pride's way of life and out to prove herself;Faythe was aggravating to read about in book one. But Vincent's writing style is powerful and immersing so I had no desire to quit and was very happy to see that she brought Faythe along so realistically and well. Faythe eventually acknowledged how much she loved and respected her family, even when they wanted to make her something she didn't want to be. She began to understand the dynamics between her Alpha father and her docile-appearing mother, and see that mom was in no way the subservient that she had perceived. Faythe had run from Marc, a Stray shifter taken in by her Pride and who had loved her since the day they met, but grown to realize that true love would allow them to work out their differences. There is always fighting going on in these books - and Faythe learns to hold her own as an Enforcer for her Pride. Her personal growth puts her in training to become the Alpha after her father steps down, and so she becomes much, much closer to her father and respects him even more.I knew that in a book called \"Alpha\", I would see Faythe arrive at the pinnacle she has strived for and in the position she has been training for. I knew that Vincent's thrill-ride story would have me on pins and needles, and my immersion into her world would be emotionally exhausting. Worse,I knew that something would happen to Faythe's dad to thrust her into leadership. I had no idea that this ride would wring me out emotionally to the extent it did, though. As I posted while reading, I was brought to tears several times and also caught myself mindlessly and fervently crunching peanuts during the Pride clashes with Montanna Alpha and all-around bad guy, Calvin Malone and his gang of chauvanistic shifters. This was war, plain and simple, and many were lost. Through all of that, Faythe struggled with her love for two men, Marc and Jace, and knowing that she had to choose between them and when she did, her whole world would change - their whole world would change - as well. I haven't given a book 5 stars in a very, very long time; I reserve that for what I call \"life-changing\" stories. While this book won't physically change my life, the series and its character development changed THEIRS, and I won't forget it. I will remember that you can grow, change and develop yourself into what you most want to be, but the road there may be so rocky you want to quit. Outside factors may drive you back and hurt you; there will be loss. But, like Faythe, you can push yourself back up and keep at it. You can act the part that you are afraid you are not capable of yet and others will see you as you really are: strong, faithful, loving and Alpha."}, {"userName": "Cf", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3498946-cf", "userReview": "Overall, I enjoyed the series not enough to re-read it but still a nice read. I was not emotionally attached to the heroine. So I did not care how the story ended or who she chose for a mate.I am not happy with the ending but I can live with it. I do believe the right man was chose but I wished he could have walked away from her to start his own life. I would have loved to continue with his journey of accepting himself as a stray, ALPHA of his own pride, and a husband/father with another tabby. Throughout the series he clearly wanted a family of his own and acceptance, not constantly being reminded he is a Stray. When he chose himself and walked away from her but still honored his promise to her father I wished it could have been the ending of their journey. I read alot of people comments and they kept stating how angry and abusive he was throughout this book. Well how would you feel when you have been 100% loyal and faithful but cannot escape the betrayal because it is front and center in your face daily. Throughout the series he never let her or the pride down but damn a guy can only take so much. At no time did he ever strike at her but instead soldiered on like a true warrior for the good of the pride. He never had time to truly deal with his emotions privately because the descretion was so public. Throughout the book, Faythe is constantly professing her love for the other guy. However, it was not true love because those panties never came off again. I wanted to scream at how much she claimed to love him but every time she thought of the pain inflicted on the other one she stopped. I would have been fine if she would have ended up with you know who because I think the other guy deserved so much better.I do wish the book contained an epilogue. The ending was short and rushed.

Then I could write a short-but-great review of this last one and really do it justice. But since I'm as mentally strong as ever, I have to write about the series as a whole. The worst thing about Alpha is that you have to read five other books using half your brain ( and wishing you were brain dead in the process) before getting to it. Without having gone through all that, Alpha is actually quite good! But by the time you get to it, you simply don't have the brains left to enjoy. Faythe (and really, what kind of a stupid name is that?) is an annoying, selfish, spoiled little brat who only starts to show some admirable qualities (but not nearly enough) at the end of the series.It honestly didn't matter that the bad guys kept calling her bitch. What did matter is that I didn't have a better name for her myself. For Marc I simply have no words. I always knew she would end up with him, that much was sadly predictable, but it made me sick all along. I really liked the guy, except for the small fact of his goods (and by goods I mean balls) beeing kept in a very small gold box and used as a fireplace decoration by his future wife. He is only allowed to open and peek on very special occasions. And come on!!! For six books I was tortured with the worst love triangle ever written ( and that's taking Twilight into account), then to have it resolved with less than two pages of stupid dialogue. There's nothing more I can say at this point except that I want a book with a super sexy, super strong vampire with no real competition. Now!

The writing is a bit scattered and confusing, the characters remained juvenile, and I just wasn't thrilled with any of it. Not only were the characters completely unchanged, but so were events. Topics that had been thoroughly covered in previous books were, once again, thoroughly covered here. Events that had happened in previous books were... well, very similar events took place here. I mean, really - if I wanted to read the same book over and over, that's what I'd do. I did enjoy some of the advice Faythe got from people here and there about her love triangle. Her relationship with her father is an interesting one, and I do like how it's evolved since the first book. But still - this love triangle. I know that not much actual time has passed between all these books, but quite a few pages have and it makes me want to grab Faythe by the shoulders, shake her til her teeth rattle, and yell \"grow up! make a choice! Embrace your decisions!\" By the end of the book, I really didn't even care whether she made a choice any more - all my caring had been used up, and it just felt like a broken record that would keep looping into infinity. I was done with it.Sigh.As for the actual plot... as I said, it's all very similar to past books and for that reason, highly predictable. Which, when major parts of the plot depend on one character or another being stupid or making a mistake, also makes you respect the characters a whole lot less, since they clearly didn't learn their lesson from last time. Malone is still evil, the council either pawns or incompetent or stupid, toms are still abusing Faythe and threatening her with rape... Same song, different verse. No, wait. Same verse. Just one or two words changed here and there. I could rant about this book all day and still not really give a decent review. If you're on book six, it's either because you love the series, you just couldn't make up your mind, or you just had to push through to see how things ended. I'm really kind of sad that by the time I did reach the end of this book, I thought it really might have been better leaving it to my imagination.I guess this author just isn't for me.

Vincent has never once disappointed in this series and there was a lot of expectation and pressure on her to write a fitting end for Faythe - and I think she did just that. Never one to share away from heartbreaking situations and consequences, this one had me in tears on numerous occasions as the realities of the war hit home and no one was safe. Everyone had a role to play in this one, although some characters got a bit less page time than I would have liked (Kaci and Manx in particular). I'm not going to comment too much on the love triangle to avoid spoilers. Its effects were painful to read at times, but I think it was handled well. The two camps are pretty opinionated on who Faythe should end up with though, so there are bound to be people disappointed with her choice, regardless of how it plays out.The book was fast paced and never really let up from the beginning until the end, which keeps the pages turning.

Yes I feel she choose the wrong tom. If you are lucky enough to be in love with two men at the same time you don't choose the one that demands it be about him and doesn't care about your happiness...that tends to lead to a jealous-filled future not a hopeful one.The writing of the dialog was sloppy, to me. Vast overuse of the pronoun \"he.\" Not something that makes it easy to read in a love triangle. Mentioning the male name ONCE at the beginning of a conversation and using \"he\" the rest of the time resulted in me having to flip back 4 or 5 pages NUMEROUS times to remember who was talking.It wasn't a cliff hanger ending, but there were so many things left open at the end that left me wishing for an epilogue. I enjoyed this book and the last one, but I'm not sure I'd recommend the series or even re-read it, because to me the ending of the series wasn't satisfying.

I would like to point out that I've been on Team Marc since the first book. Even when she was all sweet on Jace I knew that in the end she would pick Marc because he has always been behind her no matter what. He may not always understands why she does what she does but he does back her play when the time calls for it. Plus he's all adorably protective of her and when they are angry at each other they tear each other up in a way that only two people in love truly can. I think that Marc may have gotten a little too upset with Faythe about the whole sleeping with Jace thing. I mean she thought he was dead and sex with Jace was solace. I also think it may not have went over so bad if she had been honest with him right off the bat. I think the worst part of it for Marc wasn't necessarily that fact that she cheated on him but that she actually loved Jace as well. He needed to be the ONLY one in her heart. What can I say I'm a helpless romantic who loves dominant guys.Outside of the romance element the story was still excellent. Calvin Malone is such jerk. No jerk is not the word I would like to use but I am trying to stay as close to family friendly as possible here. I think that is how you tell the difference between a good writer and a great writer. They create a villain that creates a visceral disgust in the reader. I know that Malone just pissed me off left and right throughout the entire series and this book is no exception.The most annoying part being that everything he did was considered legal under the Council. Proof of a truly great deviant, he was evil while always appearing benevolent and level-headed.I literally cried when Greg died. I kind of knew that it was going to happen. I knew that he was either going to have to die or step down for the title of the book to make sense. I kept hoping I was wrong but then they started that huge battle with Malone's men and I knew it was coming. The knowing still didn't make his death any easier. I equated it with what I would be like if my mother died. I don't know if I would have handled it as well and been as strong as Faythe was. She really proves herself in this book. Yeah, she makes some mistakes but who doesn't. Plus she's the first female Alpha and one of the few who doesn't have the prior Alpha waiting in the wings to help out when needed.The ending of the book was perfect. I wasn't quite sure what was going to happen and who was going to survive. I was so afraid that the author was going to kill Jace off to sort of make Faythe's decision for her and that would have really pissed me off but it was refreshing for Jace to bow out gracefully. I knew that Marc wouldn't really leave Faythe to fight her first big battle alone I just didn't know what he was going to do to help. I had thought earlier in the book that the Pride should have asked the strays and the Bruins for help but I didn't know how that would work so when Marc showed up with the two parties I was pretty happy.So, I was happy with the way the book ended and everything that the characters accomplished. Yes, I am SUPER sad that the series is over but I will always rather have it end on a good note that to keep going on until no one can stand it anymore.

Faythe is one kick-ass chick. Is her personal life a mess? Yeah, you could say that. Does it bleed into her professional life? Yeah, it kinda does. Is that fair? No, but Faythe is honorable enough to own it and accept the consequences. If you thought Faythe did some growing up in the previous books, it's nothing compared to the growing she does in Alpha: When my dad finally stopped and faced me, I made myself meet his gaze. Long gone were the days when I would stare at the ground and whisper confessions like a naughty little girl, even if that's exactly what I felt like. I'd made a very adult mistake - which necessitated a very adult decision I had to make.Alpha picks up shortly after the events in Shift. There's going to be a vote for a new US leader. Faythe, Marc, and Jace are going as part of her father's entourage. Calvin Malone is determined to come out victorious and Faythe's proof that he's been more involved in previous issues than he'll admit to is iffy at best. Things don't go as well as they'd planned, and Faythe suffers loss in this book like never before, in more ways than one. Once again, Ms. Vincent doesn't pull any punches; I cried more than once - both times I read it.Faythe, Marc, and Jace are dealing with revelations from Book 5, Shift. Mark is angry and hurt and lashes out at Faythe. Jace and Marc are constantly on edge around each other and Faythe is frustrated with her own inability to choose between them: The tears fell faster, and a truly pathetic sob followed. \"I love them both, and they both love me, but neither of them will even hold my hand, and I'm more alone now than I've ever been in my life and it's all my own fault.\" I sniffled, my nose running from the cold and from the tears. \"It's not supposed to be like this. Love isn't supposed to break your heart. Or anyone else's.\"Finishing this book is like walking from an air-conditioned house into the hot sweltering August heat - you want to turn right around and go back inside, quickly. I know authors can't make all readers happy all the time, but I think Ms. Vincent really nailed the ending - it was perfect! (I wouldn't mind a short story in the future, a sort of epilogue, if you will, just to let us know how things are going.) This is my favorite book in the series.If you're one of those people who likes to wait until a series is finished before you start reading it - get thee to a bookstore and buy the whole series at once - you won't be sorry!!!"}, {"userName": "Booknut", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6917862-booknut", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Melissa **Just Really Loves Musicals**", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30679152-melissa-just-really-loves-musicals", "userReview": "*3.5 stars*This was read a few weeks ago so my memories aren't as fresh as I would've liked when reviewing, but I'm terrible at reviewing straight after finishing.This book was a good conclusion to a series I've been reading for quite a while now. I can't say it's a favourite series of mine, but it's definitely a unique and entertaining one. This book wasn't my favourite of them all, that would probably still be book 1, honestly, but I did like how it wrapped up. I found the beginning to drag a little, with the set up to the battle. I also found a certain part predictable, but I still found it emotional. I did like the action near the end, and as in book five, GIVE ME MORE THUNDERBIRDS. I really enjoy them. I want them to have their own book series.I can't say I'm a fan of the love triangle. It was obvious who she'd pick from the beginning, and sadly my preferred male was the loser. Oh well. I did like all of the characters, mostly, so was pleased with the ending and how it panned out. I don't think this is a series I would reread, but it is one I have enjoyed and I'm definitely interested in more books by Rachel Vincent."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2739654-sarah", "userReview": "Amazing. What a emotional roller-coaster this book was. I'm sad this is the last installment of Faythe and her Pride, but what a way to end it. I cried, I cried, I may have laughed and I cried some more. Whoa. Every time someone mention Ethan, becuase I just loved him to death, I got teary eyed. Around page 200 things got more intense - and if you didn't at least have to fight the tears back something must be wrong on your end - and didn't let up until the last page. Faythe's dilemma with the choice she needed to make was understandable, but then so was Marc's. The way the love triangle ended was exactly how it needed to end. The battle between the Prides and Malone was infuriating - because Malone was such a Hitler dillhole. I couldn't believe someone didn't do something sooner about that Dean character either, he was sick. I liked that Ryan got one last chance to repent for what he'd done and I was happy the Bruins stepped in to help.Nuff said - I'm sad this world has to end, maybe a spin off series would be good?"}, {"userName": "FlibBityFLooB", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2505272-flibbityfloob", "userReview": "4.5/5 stars. This was one of those books going in that I knew would be really intense and hard to read because of my own personal investment with the characters over the previous 5 books. True, I'm not happy with the ending, but I do understand it. Because of my personal feelings with the outcome, I'm docking the book a half point. Yes, I'm petty. *grin*There was a lot of emotion reading this book -- some teary scenes, some joyful scenes, some shocking scenes, and actually quite a few bits of humor thrown in throughout. I got a big kick out of the \"mafia\" storyline ;)I don't want to spoil the story for anyone who hasn't read it, but I will say that I was really surprised with the entire alpha-match in the driveway. I was not expecting that to happen.*sigh* I am frustrated with the ending. It's all I can do not to sigh. Then again, Faythe is a truly annoying character, so I can't say that it was a surprise ;)Still, the book, and entire series for that matter, was action packed and made for a wonderful read. :)"}], "description": "The unscrupulous new Council chair has charged Jace, Marc and me with trespassing, kidnapping, murder and treason.
