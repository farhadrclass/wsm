Set in Depression Era San Francisco and introducing the world to Samuel Spade, Hammett's The Maltese Falcon became a detective story that many in the genre still try to measure up to today. A classic that helped change the way writers told detective stories, The Maltese Falcon is a classic case that contains all the elements of a fun whodunit. Drawing inspiration from his own life, Hammett created Samuel Spade, a private eye detective who saw action in Europe in World War I. At the opening of this book, Spade has taken on the services of a new client, one Miss Bridget O'Shaughnessy, who requests protection from thugs who have tailed her around the globe. Along with the assistance of his partner Miles Archer, Spade takes the case; however, Archer is quickly gunned down by one of the aforementioned thugs, and the case spirals into action. Spade is forced to work alone with only bit help from his secretary Effie Perrine and a classic whodunit ensues. We find out that Spade has contacts all over San Francisco from his work as a private eye detective. The police do not desire that a private detective encroaches on their work, and the chief as well as the district attorney are out to get him for Archer's murder, as far fetched as that sounds. Underneath the murder and thugs is the root of the case- a Maltese Falcon figurine estimated to be worth a million dollars. In the depression era this was a large fortune, and O'Shaughnessy hopes that Spade helps her procure the Falcon and deliver both her and it to safety before the thugs find them. As this is detective noir, O'Shaughnessy goes from client to lover and good to bad. Each thug has at least one gun or pistol, and more goons seem to be hanging around each corner, all as far fetched in character as the next: Gutman, the fat man and only one with brains in the group; Cairo, the apparent boy loving Levantine; and Wilmer, Gutman's hired kid and fall guy. Each attempts to force Spade into a corner, which of course, he eventually gets his way out of. The Maltese Falcon is a classic detective noir story and fun whodunit. A depression era story where everyone wore a trench coat and hat and rolled their own cigarettes, it is also a holdover from the 1920s gangster era, which is becoming one of my favorite eras to read about. A pulp noir story that became a movie starring Humphrey Bogart, The Maltese Falcon is a classic detective tale in a genre that I am quickly starting to enjoy. I rate The Maltese Falcon 4.5 and look forward to reading more of Dashiell Hammett's detective cases."}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "2012 re-read...Sam Spade's partner is murdered and Sam is determined to find his killer. But what does Miles Archer's murder have to do with the client he was working for or the mysterious Maltese Falcon?What can I say about one of the Big Two pulp detective novels, the other being The Big Sleep? Well, let's see...The Maltese Falcon embodies a lot of what made pulp detective fiction great, leading to hordes of imitators. You've got the wise-cracking detective who has a way with the ladies, gunplay, deceit, sex, and murder. Throw in an elusive macguffin and you have a blueprint a lot of writers have been following for over three quarters of a century.Sam Spade, that blonde Satan, is the father of many detectives that came him. In fact, it would be interesting to see whether he or Raymond Chandler has more bastard detective descendents. The plot the Maltese Falcon is fairly simple. Somebody has the Maltese Falcon and everyone seems to think Sam Spade knows where it is. Miles Archer's murder complicates things a bit but really isn't much more than a bump in the road until his killer is revealed.The bad guys and supporting cast are an interesting bunch. Brigid O'Shaughnessy lays the groundwork for a lot of femme fatales to come. Gutman, Cairo, and Wilmer are more than just stock characters. The cops were a little light on personality but they were mostly in the story to hassle Spade so that's not such of a big deal.Hammett's prose drives the plot along but lacks the poetry of Raymond Chandler's. Seventeen years after I read The Maltese Falcon for the first time, I have more of an appreciation for Hammett's spare style. The plot keeps moving forward without a single misstep. It's only 200-ish pages but by the end, it feels like the perfect length for such a tale.Any complaints? Not as such. Modern readers will probably not like the book's treatment of women but it was written in the late 1920's so it has to be given a bit of slack. Honestly, my only complaints are that there aren't any more Sam Spade books and that Dashielle Hammett wasn't Raymond Chandler.For a parting thought, this line of dialogue nicely sums up Sam Spade's character:\"When a man's partner is killed he's supposed to do something about it. It doesn't make any difference what you thought of him.\""}, {"userName": "Sanjay Gautam", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10179929-sanjay-gautam", "userReview": "Everything seemed separated for the first sixty pages, with no connection whatsoever.

The Voice \u2013 Tough, Crisp hardboiled \u2013 the story isn\u2019t told in first-person but certainly has the feel of first-person since we are so close to Sam Spade it\u2019s as if we\u2019re peering over the detective\u2019s shoulder from first to last page.2. The City \u2013 The buildings and streets in San Francisco have such a tangible presence, even today, after nearly 100 years, they still give Maltese Falcon tours. 3. Femme Fatale \u2013 Brigid O\u2019Shaughnessy is the femme fatale. Her looks, her way of speaking, her cunning, her charms, her allurement\u2013 legions of writers of detective fiction have changed her name, her home town, color of her hair and eyes, but all you have to do is scratch the surface and there she is.4. Outside the Law \u2013 Nobody likes a cog in the legal wheel or a grey flannel flunkey following orders. Sam Spade is anything but \u2013 an outsider to the police, district attorney and even his clients, Sammy is his own man, cracking the case in his own way, in his own time and even willing to get socked in the jaw by a police lieutenant or pulled in by a high ranking official to make it happen.5. Tone \u2013 Sharp and crisp. If you read (and look) carefully, an entire world is disclosed, as for example: \u201cSpade emptied the unconscious man\u2019s pockets one by one, working methodically, moving the lax body when necessary, making a pile of the pockets\u2019 contents on the desk. When the last pocket had been turned out he returned to his own chair, rolled and lighted a cigarette, and began to examine his spoils. He examined them with grave unhurried thoroughness.\u201d 6. Violence \u2013 Nothing juices the action in a detective fiction more than cold bloody murder. An entire string of murders are featured here, all happening at the right time to accelerate tempo. Also, there\u2019s a good amount of roughhouse, with the least likely man in the novel, Joel Cairo, getting beat up every time he turns around. Serves him right for thinking himself so refined and above it all. 7. The Color of Character \u2013 Dashiell Hammett set the gold standard here for writers of detective fiction. \u201cThe fat man was flabbily fat with bulbous pink cheeks and lips and chins and neck, with a great soft egg of a belly that was all his torso, and pendant cones for arms and legs. As he advanced to meet Spade all his bulbs rose and shook and fell separately with such step, in the manner of clustered soap-bubbles not yet released from the pipe through which they had been blown. His eyes, made small by fat puffs around them, where dark and sleek. Dark ringlets thinly covered his broad scalp. He wore a back cutaway coat, black vest, black satin Ascot tie holding a pinkish pearl, striped grey worsted trousers, and patent-leather shoes. His voice was a throaty purr.\u201d 8. The Moral Code \u2013 As one character finds out the hard way, Sam Spade is a man of the high, uncompromising character. You will have to read the novel to find out just how high and just how uncompromising. 9. The Whole is Greater than the Parts \u2013 The Maltese Falcon has that special something that separates it from other crime fiction, even crime fiction of the first order. What is it? Hard to put your finger on it, but as millions of readers have discovered every time they pick it up, this is one doozy of a classic. 10, The Dingus \u2013 Ah, yes, the object of obsessive desire, the bird with all those long-lost jewels. Has there ever been a famous actor more closely connected with a famous object? And, yes, in many ways, the much sought after black bird adds a unique aesthetic dimension to this tale of noir. ++"}, {"userName": "Werner", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/903390-werner", "userReview": "C. S. Lewis once observed that you shouldn't review individual books or stories of a general type that you dislike, because your basic distaste for the genre is apt to blind you to the relative merits of how well the author handles the individual features of his/her work, and how it stacks up against other works of the same sort. When it comes to the whole noir school of detective fiction, that's probably advice I should heed; based both on the little of it that I've read and what I've read about it, it's not my cup of tea. The problem for me isn't the dark subject matter: my literary tastes run to the Romantic school, with its appeal to emotion, and the perils and adventures associated with urban vice and crime in sinister settings can be potentially rife with appeal to various emotions. Rather, my negative reaction is to the moral orientation (or lack of it); the noir vision is typically amoral and cynical, convinced that virtue is virtually nonexistent and doomed to defeat if it does exist, and larded with an industrial-strength existential pessimism guaranteed to thoroughly depress most any reader. Related to this is the fact that while the traditional mystery genre sees crime as an aberration of the order of things, which can be detected and set straight by the application of reason, noir views crime as the norm and denies that reason and logic can do much with it. So, noir detectives don't do much traditional detecting.To try to give Hammett his due within this subgenre, though, this is a well-done example of the school; its classic status is no accident. Sam Spade and the other characters are archetypes, not yet degenerated into stereotypes by the flood of imitations that would follow; Spade's likability factor is about nil (like all detectives of this stamp, he's often obnoxious, awash in chip-on-the-shoulder bad attitude), but you don't readily forget him, or Brigit O'Shaughnessy, Casper Guttman, or Joel Cairo. I read this novel forty years ago (it was included in a mystery anthology, the title of which I don't remember, made up otherwise of short stories); the fact that I can remember it very well after all this time says something about the vividness and force of the writing. And the solution to the murder of Spade's partner is one that does call for genuine deduction on his part, and is one I didn't see coming --though I might have if I'd been more familiar with the noir conventions. (It isn't as surprising as Christie's solution in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd --but it comes close.) A valid criticism might be that the San Francisco setting isn't really evoked very strongly --beyond a few place names and isolated details, the locale could be the mean streets of any city of that day. But Hammett's interest didn't lie in regional realism or a sense of place.Later examples of noir acquired a reputation for milking sex and violence for all the titillation it was worth, but Hammett avoids explicit sex (though he makes it clear that some illicit sex went on at one point) or gratuitous directly-described violence. Likewise, the bad language is well within the bounds of respectable realism for the characters and situations."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james", "userReview": "Book Review\n\n4 out of 5 stars to The Maltese Falcon, a classic mystery novel written in 1930 by Dashiell Hammett. If you ask a mystery fan when the genre started, a good chunk of them will say during the Golden Age (1920s & 30s) with authors like Dashiell Hammett, specifically with the creation of the Sam Spade character. Immediately what comes to mind is the old-fashioned black-and-white movies with the coat and hat on the detective, the accents and the chase scenes. While these are all true, few have actually read these novels. I've been a fan of mystery since I was a young kid, reading a bunch in my teenage years. I re-read a lot during an independent study course I design while getting my English degree while in college. This book was one of the first the Dean and my professor recommended to me. I had read parts of it and seen the movies made from it, but I wasn't as familiar with the whole Golden Age. But once you read this book, you thirst for more. It's so well-written (apart from some of the ideas that have positively changed since then, e.g. racial or gender bias) from a mystery perspective, you are immediately engaged. And one of the sub-plots in these types of books are often \"will he get the girl\" or \"is the girl on his side of the bad guy's side?\" In The Maltese Falcon, you get it all. It's international. It's romantic. It's dangerous. It's scary. It's complex. And it ends in a very unexpected kinda way. It's a game-changer for the genre and that's why it's called the Golden Age. For mystery fans, you better have read this one. For non-mystery fans, it's a good story, and if you like older books, them you should give it a chance.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.

Never before (or since) has a protagonist been forced to look so deeply within himself, to have to explain who he is to so many while not completely understanding why he is that way himself. Sam Spade knows what he has to do, and externally he knows why he has to do it. He acts assuredly, without hesitation. Yet there is a deeper part of himself that is merely along for the ride, as if some of his decisions were never really decisions at all. He has led a life with more than a few amoral choices but when confronted with what should be the easiest of shortcuts, he discovers he has a moral core that cannot be so easily overruled. An array of fascinating characters and an explanation and solution, perhaps the greatest explanation of all time because of the drama interwoven within, and upon rereading they almost become side issues compared how exposed Spade becomes and how he refuses to see it.

One day a gorgeous woman came in asking to help tracking her sister who ran away with a bad guy. The down payment was good, so the detectives took the case, no questions asked. As the direct result one of the detectives - Sam Spade - got to experience all of the traditional noir fun while readers follow ever-twisting plot. I said it countless times before and I will say it again: Sam Spade is the grandfather of all PIs in all noir, in particular all Californian PIs - Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe included. Dashiell Hammett created the genre and most of its tropes. Speaking about them - this was my reread of the book and this time I was trying to count them as they appear. For those doubting Hammett's paternity of noir I can say the following. I found them all in here. I might miss something, but every single major trope is present. Does it show its age? Yes, a little. Is it still fun to read? You bet it is. In fact this book - along with Red Harvest by the same author - is responsible for my love of noir, just like in several generations of readers before me. It is most probably a safe bet to say that Sam Spade made Philip Marlowe possible. While Hammett's prose is not as stylish as Chandler's - nobody's prose is - it is still quite good and does not feel antique. My rating is 4 stars, exactly the same as it was during my first read; recommended to any noir fan, just for historical value if nothing else."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36555254-robin", "userReview": "\"I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble.\u201dI haven't seen the famous movie version of this book starring a young, dreamy Humphrey Bogart, but now I sure want to.This 1930's noir beauty set the template for hard-boiled detective stories, paving the way for other writers like Raymond Chandler and James M.

He is a dream man in the sense that he is what most of the private detectives I worked with would like to have been and in their cockier moments thought they approached. For your private detective does not \u2014 or did not ten years ago when he was my colleague \u2014 want to be an erudite solver of riddles in the Sherlock Holmes manner; he wants to be a hard and shifty fellow, able to take care of himself in any situation, able to get the best of anybody he comes in contact with, whether criminal, innocent by-stander or client.\u201dInfluencing such later writers as Mickey Spillane, John D. MacDonald, Ross Macdonald, Robert B. Parker and scores of others, Hammett in this 1930 release founded an archetypal hero and a formulaic storyline. Hammett\u2019s Spade, epitomizing these hard boiled protagonists, was not just a solver of mysteries, distancing him from the earlier Arthur Conan Doyle model, but was himself a man of the streets. Hammett describes Spade in sinister terms, calling him a devil and revealing him to be a solver of problems with his iron will and his fists as much with his mind.The Maltese Falcon, of course, was later made into a film starring Humphrey Bogart and directed by John Huston.

Where Chandler's prose sets a baseline from which he can occasionally spring a trick in the form of a clever turn of phrase, Hammett's prose is as straightforward as it gets, which I saw as a minus. That said, the blandness of the language lets the reader concentrate on plot and characterization, where Hammett shines a touch more than Chandler. Unlike the overly-convoluted un-plot of The Big Sleep, which Chandler admits he just sort of made up as he went along and never fully understood himself, Hammett unravels a mystery, the details of which are made very clear by the end of the book. That's not to say that it's transparent, by any means. Sam Spade, the protagonist, is perpetually surrounded by liars and he's a pretty good fabricator of truths, or at least a master at twisting the truth, himself. There are plenty of surprises in store for the reader unfamiliar with the story (i.e., one who hasn't seen the movie yet - shame on you for peeking ahead!), and the reveals at the end are rewarding enough. Part of the reason for this is that Spade, while staying true to his inner self, is a great wearer of masks. His unexpected actions, which several other characters remark upon, might actually be coldly-calculated, rather than merely whimsical. And though one must question whether Spade is a good guy or a bad guy, throughout, in the end we see that he simultaneously remains true to himself while revealing his true underlying morality. Hammett shows a deft hand in presenting all of the villainous, bungling supporting cast, but shows the master-stroke in hiding the real Sam Spade until the end of the novel, where Spade's strong sense of ethics is unveiled to the reader. Perhaps this is why I found him a more fascinating, deeper character than Chandler's Philip Marlowe (whom I admired, actually).All told, though, I'm glad I read both.

But even I\u2019m hazy on the fine details of the story.In late 1920s San Francisco, a bunch of people want the priceless titular statue, and will do anything \u2013 bribe, steal, frame, kill, and lie their faces off \u2013 to get their claws on it. It\u2019s up to detective Sam Spade to keep various parties in the dark about what the others know. There\u2019s the mysterious woman who initially hires him and his partner Miles Archer to \u201cfind her sister\u201d \u2013 that backfires, since Miles winds up dead (not a spoiler: it's revealed a dozen pages in). There are the two cops who suspect Sam killed Miles because he\u2019d been sleeping with the guy\u2019s wife. And there are the three unsavoury characters who\u2019ve been following the black bird across the globe. While navigating all of these rather unlikeable characters (I think the receptionist is the only \u201cgood\u201d person in the book), Sam has to figure out where the statue is, who killed Miles and try to pocket a few bills as well. And damn it, he's not gonna take the fall for anyone.The thing is, the plot isn\u2019t the point of this crime classic. It\u2019s about the mood, the atmosphere, the hardboiled language and tough talk. It\u2019s about people being up at 3 am in the morning and thinking nothing of it. It\u2019s a character using sex to distract someone from asking difficult questions. It\u2019s the pair of contrasting, grotesque quasi villains, one an effeminate Greek homosexual* (whose relationship with another character was written out of the film version), the other a morbidly obese man whose fat rolls jiggle every time he laughs.And it\u2019s about the steady and cool way Spade figures out what\u2019s going on, the way he gets out of situations using his brains and brawn, and his nearly expressionless attitude towards crime and carnality. He\u2019s tough, but he\u2019s still got something of a moral code buried beneath his stony demeanour. I noticed some things in the book that aren\u2019t in the movie (besides the two gay lovers subplot):\u2022 A full description of the history of the eponymous statuette! It has quite the provenance! (These details would have slowed down the film\u2019s pace.)\u2022 When there\u2019s the suspicion that the central female, Brigid O\u2019Shaughnessy, may have stolen a $1000 bill, Spade takes her to the washroom and demands she remove all her clothes so he can see if she\u2019s hiding it. She complies. Wow. This definitely wouldn\u2019t have passed the Production Code inspection! Dashiell Hammett\u2019s writing is entertaining and quite effective. There\u2019s one passage where a woman talks, looks down at a settee, her eyes \u201ctracing eights,\u201d which is a clever way of showing us that she\u2019s probably lying. I literally LOL'd when I read the following description of a contemptuous bit of dialogue: \"two words, the first a short, guttural verb, the second you.\" (We can assume that \"short, guttural verb\" began with the letter F.)And there are Sam\u2019s classic quotes: \u201cIf they hang you I\u2019ll always remember you.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care who loves who I\u2019m not going to play the sap for you.\u201dRumour has it that director John Huston said, while approving the script (and I\u2019m paraphrasing), \u201cHow can you improve on the dialogue in the book?\u201dSo true. I look forward to reading some other Hammett books, like The Glass Key and The Thin Man.* By today's standards, reading the descriptions of Joel Cairo with his mincing walk, his use of perfume and his \"high-pitched voice\" \u2013 and the sneering, dismissive way the other characters treat him and call him \"queer\" and \"a fairy\" \u2013 is difficult.

The anti-hero, smooth talking P.I., the femme fatale, the plucky Girl Friday secretary, the gay gangster (uh, I'm not sure if this actually caught on) etc.I don't actually have a lot to say about this book because, while it was moderately enjoyable, it did not do anything above and beyond being that. I don't particularly like any of the characters, except the plucky secretary Effie Perine may be, the protagonist Sam Spade is very smart but I find him a little irritating and unappealing. I suppose he makes a change from defective detectives who sit around smoking pipes, playing violins and going on about their little grey cells but I like the old(er) school quirky fellows better. I guess Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe is cut from the same cloth, which would explain why I do not like The Big Sleep much either. Don't mind me, I believe it's all good stuff, just not my biscuit (much less an entire cuppa tea).I do however like Hammett's clean prose and dialogue, I don't know much about this subgenre he was writing in but if he is indeed the first author to popularize it he probably should have coined the term iNoir. In my quick Googly research about this book I read that it has a theme of \"What it's like to want something\u2014a fortune, a lover, or even respect\u2014so bad that you would kill for it, give up a chance at happiness to get it, until finally the chase itself means more to you than what you're chasing.\" I have to confess this bit of profundity escaped me entirely, I thought it was just about a tough-guy P.I. who is too cool to be fooled by foxy ladies.

It started out stilted and choppy. I also wasn't particularly keen on his predilection for cataloging every single item of clothing every character was wearing. Another thing that I found strange was his choice to describe in user-manual detail exactly how, step-by-step, Sam Spade rolls a cigarette. This happened early in the book and killed the forward movement of the narrative for me.But I read on because I found this to be a pretty interesting read (as a cultural artifact, if nothing else). I was surprised to learn that Spade's physical appearance differs so greatly from how the archetypal hard-boiled detective is portrayed in film. He's described here as a blond Satan (his countenance comprised of letter Vs, like something we'd see in a Silver Age Marvel comic book), nothing like Humphrey Bogart. I was also surprised to learn that Sam Spade is a complete asshole. You find this out early on, and it colors your perception of him throughout the book.This book had some scenes that were pretty silly. For example, at one point a stranger comes into Spade's office, and after a short conversation, points a gun at him and wants to search the office. Spade brutally disarms the gunman, knocks him out cold, and then searches through the guy's belongings. When the gunman wakes up, they finish their conversation, come to an agreement, and Spade hands the loaded gun back to the gunman! Well, of course, the gunman goes right back to pointing the thing at Sam. Pretty silly. One more thing that I found disappointing was that the titular falcon winds up in Spade's hands through absolutely no detective work on his part. I like it when detectives succeed through detection. I don't know, maybe I'm alone in this.I still plan on reading Red Harvest.

After finishing this, I probably should've started with this one but honestly, who's going to blame me for reading a Raymond Chandler novel first?Sam Spade and Miles Archer, private eyes residing in San Fransisco, are hired by a woman to procure the safe return of her little sister after she has run off with another man. While Spade accepts the job, he doesn't completely buy Ms. Wonderly's story feeling that there is more to what she's telling them. What turns out to be the understatement to end all understatement's, Spade becomes entangled in a search for a rare, valuable statue that puts his life in danger and his reputation with the law on the line.I was originally hesitant about starting this noir/hard boiled/crime fiction journey because I was under the impression that these books were going to suffer from such massive over-hype that I would feel RIDICULOUS for not liking them.This book was just tremendous. Really, just all around greatness from start to finish. It blows my mind that there had not been many books around at the time written in this style or with characters like these. It must have had people reeling when they finished it, scrambling for more!Like Chandler's The Big Sleep, this book is endlessly quotable. I'm such a fan of great similes and snappy, witty dialogue and this book is just stuffed to the breaking point with memorable lines.If it hadn't been so damn entertaining, I may have taken a little bit of an issue that Spade never really seems to be in any danger. Despite the fact that these criminals have the upper hand on a few occasions, they come across as buffoons with no real plans of their own.That being said, it's hard to really find fault in something so excellent.On a side note, something tells me that if I slap someone and they get angry, I wouldn't be able to tell them they'll take it AND like it.

Confidential\u00a0and more vulnerable than Raymond Chandler's Marlowe. In\u00a0The Maltese Falcon, the best known of Hammett's Sam Spade novels (including\u00a0The Dain Curse\u00a0and\u00a0The Glass Key), Spade is tough enough to bluff the toughest thugs and hold off the police, risking his reputation when a beautiful woman begs for his help, while knowing that betrayal may deal him a new hand in the next moment.Spade's partner is murdered on a stakeout; the cops blame him for the killing; a beautiful redhead with a heartbreaking story appears and disappears; grotesque villains demand a payoff he can't provide; and everyone wants a fabulously valuable gold statuette of a falcon, created as tribute for the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. Who has it? And what will it take to get it back? Spade's solution is as complicated as the motives of the seekers assembled in his hotel room, but the truth can be a cold comfort indeed.Spade is bigger (and blonder) in the book than in the\u00a0movie, and his Mephistophelean countenance is by turns seductive and volcanic. Sam knows how to fight, whom to call, how to rifle drawers and secrets without leaving a trace, and just the right way to call a woman \"Angel\" and convince her that she is. He is the quintessence of intelligent cool, with a wise guy's perfect pitch. If you only know the movie, read the book. If you're riveted by\u00a0Chinatown\u00a0or wonder where Robert B. Parker's Spenser gets his comebacks, read the master.\u00a0--Barbara SchlieperMy Review: There's nothing second-best about this book, no indeed not. It's a fine, solid book, one with a lot of good story packed into some very well-chosen words.But the film, well now, sometimes perfection comes in unexpected places. Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet! What a pair of second-raters! And how perfectly they meshed, and then add Peter Lorre, another second-rater, and the Holy Trinity couldn't have done better work with the tale being told here. It was a super retelling of the basic story.Wisecracks that, on the page, made me smile and even giggle, came out of Bogart's mouth, and Lorre's, and even Greenstreet's, at a wonderful pace and were there and gone...just like a wisecrack should be. Not to put down the book by any means! It's a fun read, and it's a well-made novel, and it's a classic noir for a reason.But for me, only for me, I want the film to be my memory of this story.Rating: 4* of fiveThe Publisher Says: \"My name is David Brandstetter. I'm a claims investigator for the Medallion Life Insurance Company.\" He handed her a card. She didn't glance at it. \"I'm looking for Peter Oats,\" he said.\"He's not here. I wish he were. Maybe you can help me. The police don't seem to care.\"She was April Stannard. Her lover, Peter's father, had died. April believed he'd been murdered.Dave Brandstetter's investigation takes him through the rare-book world, to backstage at a community theatre, to the home of a world-famous television performer. Along the way, Dave soon comes to agree with April.My Review: Small-town California has a lot of atmosphere, according to Hansen; I don't remember it that way, but I was young and miserable, so I'll go with the man who found there something that led to this description of an old mill made into a theater:The waterwheel was twice a man\u2019s height, wider than a man\u2019s two stretched arms. The timbers, braced and bolted with rusty iron were heavy, hand-hewn, swollen with a century of wet. Moss bearded the paddles, which dripped as they rose. The sounds were good. Wooden stutter like children running down a hall at the end of school. Grudging axle thud like the heartbeat of a strong old man.Beautiful.It's with this book, second in the series, that Hansen's chops come fully into play. He's here to wow you, and he's got the story to keep you sitting right there flipping pages. April, the bereaved, is Rita Hayworth in my mind; Oates, the dead guy, looks like John Garfield; Peter, the son and heir, is Cabaret-era Michael York; and so on and so on. (Eve, Oates' ex-wife, is Barbara Stanwyck.) I do this a lot, cast the perfect movie cast as I read along. But this time it felt as if it was all done for me. Oates' murderer, when revealed, was a surprise to me even though this was a re-read. And the actor I'd put in the role was perfect...no testament to my skills, just an example of how beautifully Hansen draws his characters.Dave's got a man, too...how amazing for the 1970s! I so wish this had been a TV series.

Let's be honest, you probably have. But luckily this is no ordinary dame. And the office belongs to no ordinary detective. They are Miss Wonderly (not her only name, by the way) and Sam Spade, the mold by which all hard-boiled fast-talking slang-laden detective stories are made. The Maltese Falcon chronicles their shared adventures chasing a valuable, bejeweled falcon statuette that's been stolen and brought to San Francisco. There are fistfights, gunfights, slapping fights, lots of well-dressed men trading banter while well-dressed women watch, people get murdered, the police blunder around, everybody drinks a lot, and it's fucking awesome. Along with his talent for writing dialogue and action scenes, Dashiell Hammett also has a gift for physical description, as seen here:\"She was tall and pliantly slender, without angularity anywhere. Her body was erect and high-breasted, her legs long, her hands and feet narrow. She wore two shades of blue that had been chosen because of her eyes. The hair curling from under her blue hat was darkly red, her full lips more brightly red. White teeth glistened in the crescent her timid smile made.\" and here:\"The fat man was flabbily fat with bulbous pink cheeks and lips and chins and neck, with a great soft egg of a belly that was all his torso, and pendant cones for arms and legs. As he advanced to meet Spade all his bulbs rose and shook and fell separately with each step, in the manner of clustered soap bubbles not yet released from the pipe through which they had been blown. His eyes, made small by fat puffs around them, were dark and sleek. Dark ringlets thinly covered his broad scalp. He wore a black cutaway coat, black vest, black sating Ascot tie holding a pinkish pearl, striped grey worsted trousers, and patent-leather shoes.\" The best part of all of this, really, is that a book that's full of all the awesome stuff I've described above is on the list of 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die.

His yellow-grey eyes were horizontal. The v motif was picked up again by thickish brows rising outward from twin creases above a hooked nose, and his pale brown hair grew down\u2014from high flat temples\u2014in a point on his forehead.

I read The Maltese Falcon over forty years ago, and I find it just as compelling and entertaining as I did then. And that\u2019s the case even though I\u2019ve seen John Huston\u2019s film adaptation more times than I care to mention, and given the fact that the images from that film are indelibly etched in my brain. So, despite Hammett\u2019s bizarre physical description of Spade, tall, big-boned, muscular, pale, yellow-eyed, yellow-haired, with sharp v-shaped features that make him seem Satanic, I can\u2019t help seeing and hearing Humphrey Bogart. But that\u2019s not a problem for me. It\u2019s not even a problem when I think that Bogart\u2019s Sam Spade and his Phillip Marlowe (The Big Sleep) are pretty much the same guy. After all, Bogie was Bogie. And, although different, Spade and Chandler's Marlowe are both \u201cdream,\u201d men, each emerging from the imaginations of two of the greatest writers in the genre.No need to re-hash the plot in a synopsis; there are plenty of synopses for those unfamiliar with this classic. I\u2019m just going to reference some salient points in the novel\u2019s structure that impress me both as a reader and a writer.*Third-person objective narration. Hammett makes great use of a narrative style that was pioneered by Hemingway. Rather than telling us what a character thinks or feels in any particular situation, the narrator shows us through what I call stage-craft, a combination of dialogue, movement, gestures, expressions, reactions, etc. For example, we can learn something about Spade's character by observing the way he sits at his desk and rolls a cigarette, or his sexually suggestive byplay with his young, female secretary, his wise-cracking and defiant attitude toward both the authorities and the crooks. Hammett handled this brilliantly and this style was ideal for John Huston\u2019s almost equally brilliant screen adaptation. *Characterizations: Some critics might carp about stereotypes or even caricatures, the sort of criticism leveled at Dickens, for example. But if Hammett gave us caricatures, they were done with consummate skill and artistry, the way artists like Daumier or Toulouse-Lautrec used exaggeration to get at the truth behind a fa\u00e7ade, to rip off the mask and dig down deep to the character hidden beneath the surface. The point being, the characters in this novel, beginning with Sam Spade, seem real, they grab your attention and don\u2019t let go.*Dialogue: Realistic and believable. Written almost ninety years ago, it still seems fresh. And the scene where Spade explains why he won\u2019t play the sap for the femme fatale, and how she\u2019s going to take the fall, despite her obvious appeal and protestations of love, is riveting.*The MacGuffin: The Maltese Falcon is my favorite example of what Alfred Hitchcock called a MacGuffin. The MacGuffin is a plot device, a \u201cdingus\u201d, to use Spade\u2019s expression, that drives the action, the actual nature of which is not necessary to the story. The MacGuffin/Dingus just has to be something that people will lie, cheat, steal, betray, seduce and kill for. What I especially like is the way Hammett ups the ante with the falcon, slowly letting it increase in value in the reader\u2019s mind until the big reveal about what it is and why the characters will stop at nothing to get it. *Length: The Maltese Falcon is a relatively short novel, about 218 pages in print, or about 67,000 words. Thank God Hammett didn\u2019t have to pad it to get a word count. As is, the fast pace coupled with great dialogue, unforgettable characters and a tight, expertly crafted plot are about as good as it gets.Just one minor quibble: Gutman\u2019s daughter. After two readings, admittedly more than forty years apart, I\u2019m still not sure why she\u2019s in this novel. Huston cut her from the film, and I think that was a good idea. However, he didn\u2019t have to cut too much else. And Huston\u2019s revised ending, with the famous Shakespearean misquote, \u201c\u2026the stuff that dreams are made of\u2026\u201d is justified, or excused, by Iva Archer and Effie Perine\u2019s reduced roles in the film. And, to be fair, Hammett's ending works fine in the novel, but wouldn't have worked in the movie.The bottom line: This novel is a must-read for anyone interested in the genre."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/890233-maureen", "userReview": "there are these big stories, stories that aren't necessarily long but are tremendously meaningful. they carry seeds of big things, of fundamental truths, that whisper to us of some big answer, the kind of answer we might wish for or even dread but don't dare believe. chipping away at the bumpers in the pinball game of our brains, these are ideas that compel us, that make us pause, and consider just what it's all about, and where we fit in. there's a story like that in this book. it's called the flitcraft story. you can read it, out of the context of the novel here: http://unfutz.blogspot.com/2006/11/30...i love that story. i come back to it constantly when i read other stories, looping back to thinking who am i? can i change? can anybody? and how it is a perfect encapsulation of all the hope and fear i have about being and identity. i find myself muttering about beams falling, and looking up above me, hoping for one to come crashing down, to start me in a different direction even if it won't be entirely fresh. i know. at this point you're probably thinking that i'm supposed to be reviewing the maltese falcon and i haven't said very much about the novel as a whole. it's not my favourite hammett book, though i love it for showcasing so many of hammett's strengths. and absolutely, even without the flitcraft story, the maltese falcon has a lot to recommend it: hammett's powerfully terse prose, his biting, honest dialogue, the prototypical hard-boiled blond devil called sam spade with all his \"v\"s, and a story of misdirection rightly recognized as bedrock in the detective novel genre. so i can honestly say even without the flitcraft story this novel succeeds. but with flitcraft as part of a novel, hammett sets up the story within the story in a way that balances the characters, and the novel itself: in the midst of all these lies, and games, there is that knowing that there is that answer just out of reach, in a matter of circumstance.hammett is one of my all-time favourite authors. i think every book he wrote is worth reading, and that his writing is instructive. i will not compare him to others -- i believe as much as possible, one has to take him entirely on his own merits. due diligence done.last year, a recurrence of flitcraft obsession led me to the quote below, which comes from a memoir written by hammett's daughter, jo: Dashiell Hammett: A Daughter Remembers. it made me really happy that he took such pride in the thousand words that mean so much to me, especially that last line. \"My father and I were out on the lawn in the backyard of my mother's house in West L.A.
