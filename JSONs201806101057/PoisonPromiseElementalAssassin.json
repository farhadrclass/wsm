Gin is now up against an emotion draining, drug dealing, mad scientist vampire so we are back on solid ground.It\u2019s been a busy year in Gins life. She\u2019s killed a few bad guys, got her heart broken by one dude and fell in love with another. She discovered a deeper well to her magic and her skills and picked up a few friends along the way. She has also come out of the closet so to speak and now absolutely everyone knows she is the infamous assassin the Spider.Well it is another day so it is time to go up against yet another bad guy. Benson isn\u2019t just another Vampire drug dealer, he likes to play mad scientist and his new drug Burn that is out on the market seems to target people with Elemental magic and give them an even bigger high. He reminds me a little of a bond villain and can be a bit OTT at time but all in all he\u2019s a pretty good villain.Bria on the other hand shows just how like Gin she can be in her single minded craziness and maybe goes a little overboard but she is a woman on a mission to bring Benson and his drug empire down. Finn as ever never lets anything get to him. Not even the new wedge between his girlfriend and almost sister. He at least was the comic relief that this book needed.\n\u201cAw, man,\u201d Finn said, coming up to stand beside me, a black duffel bag dangling from his hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t even get to shoot anybody.\u201d \u201cWell, look on the bright side,\u201d I drawled. \u201cYour clothes didn\u2019t get messed up. Neither did your hair.\u201d Finn perked up at my reasoning.\u201d \nBut the most interesting part of the book actually came in the last few chapters as it is revealed who Mab\u2019s long lost relative is and what they\u2019ve come to Ashland for. All and all a decent recovery to what was for me a horrible last book. I\u2019m really hoping that Gin and MMM have an interesting battle ahead since she seems like she might be more of a handful than even Mab was."}, {"userName": "Choko", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27962805-choko", "userReview": "*** 4 ***A buddy read with my UF assassins at BB&B! We meet every Wednesday and compare our silverstone knives.... It finally happened! A truly Machiavellian villain is making her play and starts by manipulating Gin and a crazy ass vampiric drug dealing boss bad guy into eliminating each-other, or at least one of them to get rid of the other for her, and whoever is left, well, she will see... The problem is, Gin has become too predictable, thus allowing her friends and enemies to push her buttons in a manner which could be used for others' purposes... I have been expecting this sooner or later, and have been worried that every weakness, or strength of Gin's character, would become known to all as her visibility has grown and her anonymity is a thing of the past... Gin has been able to deal with all the attacks of her person, but she has gotten comfortable with enemies who come at her mostly straight ahead. She is not prepared for someone to play a deeper, more complex chess game with her... And the new player in town has been laying in wait and watching her for some time, learning the ways Gin reacts to different situations and weaving a web of evil and deceit that can catch even the Spider. This book got back to the typical adrenaline inducing Spider books, after a slow and confusing book 10. We get to enjoy the full power of the supporting cast and especially my favorite snarky and wonderfully sarcastic pretty boy Finn. His girlfriend Bria acted a bit out of control, although it was understandable to a degree... Owen is back to being boyfriend of every girls' dreams, and Philip has their back. At the end of the book an old nemesis shows up again and proves once more that in this worlds' Ashland, sometimes is best to go around the laws and regular punitive system, and trust the good old \"kill your enemies, or they will come back to haunt you\" motto... SO, I am expecting the series to go to an even higher level of villainy now that the gauntlet of war has been thrown down, so I can't wait to get into the next volumes! I wish all of you Happy Reading and may you always find what you are looking for!"}, {"userName": "Sharon \u221e\u2765 is an emotional book junkie \u2765\u221e ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3275325-sharon-is-an-emotional-book-junkie", "userReview": "Since Gin took care of Mab, people trying to kill her have been coming out of the woodwork. So it's no surprise when she gets herself caught in the middle of a drug lord's operation. Now she just has to figure how to get out and keep herself and everyone else alive. There is just no one like Gin...she takes a licking and keeps on ticking. LOL...sorry I had to do it but it's really true. It's always hard to read about her getting a beat down. Thank goodness for Jo-Jo.And thank goodness for Owen. I love how he totally supports her now and is just there for her. They all just get it (yes, even Bria comes around). And thankfully we have Owen for those steamy moments although this book could've used a few more since it was on the barely steamy side. :(My favorite thing is Gin coming into her own. She's so much more than just The Spider but she's finding her way. It's hard to let go of something she's been for so long and she has to decide whether or not to embrace it....totally. Of course, lots of shout outs to favorite characters such as Owen, Finn, Bria, Roslyn, Xavier, Jo-Jo, Sophia, Phillip and now....Silvio and Catalina. Those last two are some great additions. I loved the big battle and how Gin took the initiative. I even think Fletcher would be proud. Now onto the other drama and M.M.M. Well, there certainly were some big revelations but nothing that wasn't too hard to figure out. It will be interesting to see where JE goes with this since the next book is the last contracted one.

I guess it was entertaining to a certain extent, but as usual nothing surprising or exciting happened. The majority of characters pissed me off for various reasons (too dull, too irritating, too Mary Sueish), there were only a couple who were actually decent/likeable.Random thoughts:-I used to love Gin's character, she had attitude and backbone but in the last few books she's become a doormat and somewhat of a cliche. There was nothing fun or engaging about her, she was very boring and predictable in her every thought and action. Even though she was meant to be a feared assassin, she mainly came across as a pushover and a huge Mary Sue who let everyone walk all over her. She was the most dullest assassin ever. -Owen was as irritating as usual. He was still one of the worst and most unappealing love interests I've ever read\u2026 And that's saying something since I've read my fair share of rubbish heroes. I find it bizarre how every fucked up thing he did in the recent past was forgotten, he hurt Gin and broke her trust in many different ways yet they both acted like nothing happened, and instead were all lovey dovey with each other. It didn't ring true to Gin's character, she was meant to find it difficult to trust people, so for her to be sucked in by Owen after all his betrayals was nonsensical and made Gin look inconsistent and weak. Also, Owen suddenly acting like the perfect supportive/nice boyfriend was nauseating, it in no way made me forget his lying, cheating, choosing another woman over her, and him basically shrugging and not giving a shit when he thought Gin was dead. His cool and uncaring attitude to Gin being kidnapped, tortured, and near death throughout the series just showed how little he cared for her. It was a shame Gin was too pathetic and desperate to see that Owen didn't give a fuck about her.-I HATED Bria. What a horrid, hypocritical cow. The way she acted towards Gin and everyone else was appalling. She bitched about Gin being an assassin, was disgusted by her, and looked down at her even though she previously said she was fine with it. What pissed me off most was her telling Gin to stop interfering in her police work as she wanted to do things legal and above board\u2026 So when Gin respected Bria's request, instead of being grateful, Bria had a hissy fit and shouted at Gin for not assassinating the bad guy she previously told Gin not to assassinate. Ugh, she was such a contradictory, holier than thou, hypocritical wanker. What Bria really wanted was Gin to clean up all her messes by whatever means necessary even if it meant Gin had to kill loads of people and risk her life, and at the same time Bria also wanted to look down at her in disgust for being a killer. She wanted the best of both worlds \u2014 an assassin sister at her beck and call, and an assassin sister she was ashamed of, could bitch about, and act morally superior to. The cow.-Bria's crappy character made me dislike both Gin and Finn's character even more just for putting up with her bitchiness and letting her get away with her vile attitude\u2026 Neither of them really stood up to her, I was waiting for Gin to properly stand up for herself and tell her some home truths but she never did, she just took all Bria's bullshit and then forgave and forget. Was Gin being a doormat meant to make her more likeable or something? It just made her come across like an insufferable Mary Sue martyr.-Another thing that frustrated me about Gin was her always feeling guilty about things she didn't need to feel bad about\u2026 Like when she was forced to take drugs by the bad guy she started having bitchy thoughts about her loved ones for all of a minute\u2026 And then afterwards she felt oh so bad about having those thoughts even though she'd been drugged up and hadn't been in her right mind and barely thought badly of them. Really? Why the hell would anyone feel bad about having the odd bitchy thought about friends/family? Especially if they were the result of drugs they were forced to take. Literally EVERYONE has the occasional bitchy thought about loved ones (and that's when they're not even bloody high), it's not a big deal and it's nothing to feel guilty about\u2026 Yet Mary Sue Gin felt all bad for deigning to have a couple of negative thoughts about those closest to her. Give me a fucking break.-The world was fairly interesting and easy to immerse into but it was also rather stagnant\u2026 It hadn't expanded or become any richer since the first book. -I wish Gin would stop referring to Owen as her lover and Bria as her baby sister, it was so cringey and repetitive.-What on earth did Finn see in the hypocritical shrew that was Bria? Why does he even like her? I can't see any reason why he wants her more than any other woman he's dated in the past. Well, except for the fact that she just so happens to be Gin's sister.-The M. M. Monroe reveal was underwhelming, after waiting for 3 books to find out who it was, they just turned out to be a poorer/crappier version of Mab. It was so anti-climactic.-I expect the next book will be the same as usual\u2026 The new baddie will target Gin or someone close to her, Gin will fight them and get hurt in the process, then she'll recover and fight them again, and at the last minute she'll win but not without being bloodied and bruised\u2026 Of course, all of Gin's loved ones will survive. No-one will die expect for the baddie or some new character. It'd be good if someone close to Gin (like Finn, Bria, JoJo, Owen, or Roslyn) actually died instead of them always surviving.All in all, Poison Promise wasn't spectacularly awful but it certainly wasn't good either\u2026 I did like that it was a fast, easy, and somewhat distracting read but it was let down by the run of the mill villain of the week type plot and the uninteresting and insipid characters."}, {"userName": "If it ain't good I don't read it !", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8370340-if-it-ain-t-good-i-don-t-read-it", "userReview": "oh...

Jennifer Estep\u2019s Elemental Assassins series is one such series. Reading Poison Promise (book 11!!!) was like reconnecting with old friends. I love the world that this author has built. The town of Ashland is corrupt, its officials are on the take, the bad guys are vying to fill in a power vacuum \u2013 this is one interesting place. In the center of it all stands Gin Blanco, aka The Spider, a very efficient assassin and an even better cook.Gin is one badass assassin. She\u2019s tough, she\u2019s snarky, she\u2019s lethal, and she cares about her family. I like how Gin tries to keep her life as normal as possible. She\u2019s attending community college, taking a course on spy literature, and she surrounds herself with a fantastic support network: her family and friends. To keep it real, Gin continues to work at her restaurant, The Pork Pitt.Poison Promise might just be the best book so far in the series. It was action packed, full of exciting scenes, bullets flying, and general mayhem. I just could not put this book down.I think that what makes this series so much fun to read is the diversity of characters in this world. There\u2019s vampires, giants, dwarfs, and elementals in addition to the regular human folk. The elemental magic is different from what I\u2019ve seen in other series.Then there\u2019s the men of this series. Yes, Owen is still around, but you\u2019ll need to read the book for more info. Gin\u2019s sexy foster brother Finnegan Lane is a perfect backup for Gin. I loved how he got Gin her very own silver Aston-Martin to wreck. Silvio was a good addition to the cast as well. I can\u2019t wait to see him in the next book.If you have not yet had a chance to start this series, I\u2019d recommend you start with the first book. For those of you who may have stopped reading the series, the writing has improved significantly and the repetition has been greatly reduced.I can\u2019t wait for the next book \u2013 Black Widow due out November 2014.Thank you to NetGalley and Pocket Books for a review copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Anna (Bobs Her Hair)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3167458-anna-bobs-her-hair", "userReview": "[ Not rape.

She\u2019s about to celebrate her 31st birthday, and in many ways this book felt like a new beginning. There were some seriously badass scenes in POISON PROMISE, mad scientist villains are always super creepy, and two additional paranormal elements are introduced which all added-up to one exhilarating read. However, there was also a lot of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in this novel (that annoying stick that was up Bria\u2019s butt in the earlier days is once again firmly lodged in place) that was cause for some concern. Jennifer Estep hasn\u2019t steered me wrong yet, so I\u2019m going to wait and see what she has planned, but I do have my doubts.It\u2019s no secret that I\u2019m an action junkie through and through, and this latest installment DEFINITELY delivered on this front. As an assassin, Gin typically does her best work in the shadows, but in POISON PROMISE she boldly shouts to the world that she is indeed The Spider. That was my #1 scene in this book; you\u2019ll know it when you read it. My second favourite was when she uses her Aston Martin as a battering ram. OMG Pure awesomeness. Those two stellar sequences aside, the plot\u2019s great; I always look forward to Estep\u2019s villains, and she does not disappoint with Beauregard Benson. I also enjoyed the vivid descriptions of what a Burn trip is like from an Elemental\u2019s POV, and the twist at the end was well-done.This is probably going to turn into a paragraph long rant about Bria, but it couldn\u2019t really be avoided because she is the main reason why I\u2019m giving this novel four stars instead of five. I really hated her character in the earlier installments of this series, and now here she is back on her stupid high horse. I understand that she\u2019s blinded by revenge and seeing red, but she\u2019s still a cop, and has sworn to serve and protect. Now, all of a sudden she\u2019s willing to sacrifice an innocent witness\u2019 life, and quite possibly her sister\u2019s as well? Bria needs wake-up, to stop judging Gin, and either arrest her or shut it. I wanted to slap her.I love that this series continues to surprise me; Estep has added two new paranormal elements to her ELEMENTAL ASSASSIN world. I\u2019m not sure revealing them in my review is overly spoiler-y, but I don\u2019t want to ruin it for anyone so I\u2019m just going to say that my interest is definitely piqued. A new character has also joined Gin\u2019s crew, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how Silvio Sanchez fits in with this close knit group. I have a feeling that big things are in store for The Spider now that she\u2019s gone public; I just hope that the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu doesn\u2019t take over the main story line. I\u2019m extremely wary of Mab Monroe 2.0.My mini Bria rant aside, POISON PROMISE is an action junkie\u2019s dream, and another winning installment from Jennifer Estep."}, {"userName": "\u2718\u2718 Sarah \u2718\u2718 (former Nefarious Breeder of Murderous Crustaceans)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7298986-sarah-former-nefarious-breeder-of-murderous-crustaceans", "userReview": "[(when Gin is tortured by Benson) (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "SoWrongItsRANDI {Bell, Book & Candle}", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29306979-sowrongitsrandi-bell-book-candle", "userReview": "I received an advance copy from Net Galley in exchange for an honest review.

But that all changes when a new, powerful drug is distributed on the streets. With the drug kingpin gearing up to take control of the corrupt city and stomp out \"the Spider\" at the same time, Gin certainly has some serious work ahead of her. But Gin is the assassin \"Spider\", and she has the patience to wait out her enemies to deliver the fatal strike.Okay so my actual rating is 4.5 stars. I have to say that Jennifer Estep seems to be getting better with each book of this series. This is definitely one of my favorites in the series. I like how she briefly, yet effectively describes events that happened prior to this book for those who haven't read the previous books. There was a nice pacing in the story, and the action was very engaging. It was the perfect blend of action, romance, paranormal and comedy all wrapped up in one. The ending was kind of like...I'm definitely ready for more.CharactersGin Blanco: I love, love, LOVE how feisty she is. One of my favorite things about this series, is her. Saying \"I love a strong female protagonist\" is the understatement of the century. She's her usual witty, brave, open-a-can-of-whoop-ass self that I have always enjoyed.

I love Gin and her friends. I love her overwhelming need to protect them. Each book brings a spotlight to one of those relationships. This time we, the reader, get a little more into the dynamics between Gin and her sister, Bria. Jennifer Estep does a fantastic job of revealing the love, competition, resentment, and admiration in a relationship between older and younger sisters. I don\u2019t know if she has a sister, but she nailed this one on the head. This struggle happens all within the context of Gin battling an evil gangster and the emergence of a new super villain. Beauregard Benson is flooding the streets of Ashland with a new drug called Burn. It\u2019s highly addictive and seems to affect Elementals especially hard. Benson is not a new criminal in Ashland, but he is making his move to become a big player. Benson is not only a drug pusher, but considers himself a scientist noting with Mengele-like eeriness the pain and suffering as he pumps the drugs into his subjects.Bria is desperate to bring Benson down and the stress brings certain emotions to the surface. Being on opposites side of the law, she and Gin have a conflicted relationship already and the pressure of this pursuit results in a painful confrontation for both. This is not the first time they have clashed, but this one is unexpected considering things are going well between them. Gin is different too. She is tired of constantly looking over her shoulder and fighting for her life. Her weariness makes her think twice about engaging with Benson.As this conflict resolves, a new one emerges. We learn the identity of M.M. Monroe. This sets up a whole new set of challenges for Gin and for me, restarts the series. M.M. Monroe promises to be a worthy adversary for our beloved Gin and I am looking forward to this epic conflict. IN A NUTSHELL:A fantastic addition to the Elemental Assassin series, Poison Promise is a heart-satisfying story with dramatic turns and suspense. Highly recommended.Thank you to the author, publisher and Netgalley for the opportunity to read the book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6703235-ian", "userReview": "All Gin wants is to be known as the owner of the Pork Pit, home to Ashland's best BBQ. Unfortunately she can't shake off her other title, The Spider, the assassin who killed underworld king-pin Mab Monroe. Now every two bit hood who wants to make a name for himself is gunning for her and she spends as much time dealing with them as serving pulled pork and coleslaw. When she stumbles onto one of her waitresses being threatened by a drug dealer and his goons she steps in and makes short work of them, but it soon becomes apparent she's bitten off a little more than even she can chew. Now she has come to the notice of Beau Benson, a sadistic vampire who doesn't just drink blood, he sucks the very life force out of his victims, feeding on their fears and insecurities.

I should be pointing out recycled plots. I'm not. Her last few books are easily the best in the series. Heart of Venom (book #9) is a stand out as my personal favorite, but Poison Promise is definitely in the running for the silver medal. This whole series is brash and violent.

Toxic good fun! No longer feared, Gin is now revered, and finally getting the due she deserves! Well that's not entirely true... only by the people she doesn't plan on killing.Awesome, awesome, awesome!! I loved everything about this book! Eleven books in and this series is still going strong, and building up steam for what I'm guessing is going to be an amazing conclusion at some point, hopefully not to soon though. Let the smack-downs begin, or at least more of them! Jennifer Estep has quite the imagination and all of her villains are very unique. They torture and kill their victims and it's always deliciously gruesome, and the evil entity in Poison Promise was right up there with the best of them. Sick, right? No, it's what I expect in an Urban Fantasy read and this author always delivers in a big way.When Gin dishes out her own brand of punishment and revenge, well, I'm giddy with glee! Kick-ass doesn't even begin to describe Gin, she's the assassin that keeps on giving...a knife to the back, a slash to the throat, a stab to the chest...good times I tell you, good times!The entire gang gets into the act and whenever that happens things get really interesting.

Finn...sexy, charming sniper in a suit, he's so adorable when he's protecting his foster sister, usually by pumping bullets into the bad guys. Such a lovely way to express love for your sibling. Oh, and the delicious Owen...I love how he steps back and lets Gin do her thing, but doesn't hesitate to jump into the fray when his woman needs him. Who wouldn't love a guy that respects what you do, doesn't judge, but would kill for you?! They were all here...Bria, Xaviar, Sophia, Jo-Jo, Roslyn, Phillip, Eva...made this read extra special, because when they come together and fight for their girl...watch out!Jennifer Estep has finally learned not to reiterate so much of the back story, just a brief overview here and there, she stuck to the plot at hand in Poison Promise and it was fantastic! Urban Fantasy series are not something you can jump into in the middle of, you have to start at the beginning and most readers are already familiar with the events surrounding the story and characters, so a gentle reminder is fine, but it can be annoying when past events are re-hashed over and over. I'm pleased to say, that was not the case here.A fantastic new character was introduced and I think he is going to be very important and essential in helping Gin find her place, or quite possibly her throne in the community! Big changes are coming to Ashland and Gin is at the forefront of it all! This series ticks all my perfect Urban Fantasy buttons and I can't recommend it enough! *A copy of the book was provided by Pocket Books via NetGalley*"}, {"userName": "Douglas Meeks", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5970245-douglas-meeks", "userReview": "Well this is the 11th book in the Elemental Assassin series and they show no signs of getting stale. This installment is more of a warm-up for the next one I fear though since we actually get to meet MM Monroe for a few pages but that is not the villain for this novel but it does give you an idea of what Gin is going to be up against.Let us get back to what THIS book is about, Gin through a series of somewhat seemingly random events runs afoul of a local drug lord named Benson and while he is a vampire and commands a large criminal army it is a special power of his that make him a dangerous foe for Gin.This book we see a bit of family strife between Bria and Gin, a new friend and what looks to be a new permanent addition to Gin\u2019s entourage. I can\u2019t say too much more than that without being spoilerish and I stay away from spoilers.There is a new drug on the streets called Burn and it is making Benson a lot of money, Gin and Bria are both looking to put an end to him and his business. The job is easier said than done and it is not going to be neither easy nor painless.This may be the first novel in awhile that her love life seem to be actually approaching something normal and steady which I think is long overdue since her love life has been in shambles in most of the novels in this series.Bottom Line: It is the Elemental Assassin, bad guy shows up, threatens somebody she cares for; little blood on both sides and bad guy has a really, really bad day. This novel is saved from reading like a formula from other books by some interesting side interests and the addition of a couple of interesting new characters. The manner of the culminating conflict is a bit new also, I liked it; hope to see more of it. I have to give it 4.5 Stars and almost want to lower it to 4 because I suspect the next one is going to be really great and I am running out of stars but that would not really be fair to this book."}, {"userName": "Kathy Davie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4222001-kathy-davie", "userReview": "Eleventh in the Elemental Assassin urban fantasy series and revolving around a \"retired\" assassin.If you're interested, there is a chronological listing of the Elemental Assassin books on my website.My TakePart of the story revolves around Finn and the always birthday party he insists on. Another part revolves around Gin's sister as Gin discovers that little sister is not all that accepting of Gin's secret role.A fact that rears up a very ugly head when Gin reports a murder. Bria's lost someone she owed, and now she's taking it out on everyone, but especially on Gin. It's a nasty switch for Gin, to see the ugly on her sister's face. To realize where that look comes from. It does lead to Xavier really tearing into Bria. Does a good job of pointing out what a hypocrite she is! But it's not working and Bria is so incredibly careless.We get a bit more on Roslyn's background. How she got out of the life and opened Northern Aggression. Some scary stuff, there.As for Gin versus Beauregard, it's a battle of calm, for Beau needs, wants, is addicted to the fear and terror of his potential victims. For Gin, it's a battle against her better nature and her fear for her family, how tired she is of battling the would-be assassins around every corner.\n\"'You can't just keep killing people for free. Pro bono is not a phrase that is in the Finnegan Lane vocabulary.'\n'Oh, no,' I drawled. 'But greedy, shameless hustler certainly is.'\n'Damn skippy.'\"\nI do love Gin's feistiness. She won't let anything get her down. She'll even use the torture to discover a new release and insight into herself.We also learn a bit more about Gin's life on the streets, and it's her reflection on one particular incident that makes Gin realize how wrong she's been.Gin's rep is on the line, and I do love how she turns that around. Whew\u2026 Estep keeps getting Gin into some tricky situations, and it's such a treat to see how Estep gets her back out again.Pant, pant, gotta catch my breath\u2026 It's this story that sets up \nBlack Widow\n, 12. Unfortunately for me, I missed Poison Promise somehow, so I can tell you from experience: Do NOT read these out of order. It's very confusing. I found myself questioning events and characters throughout, trying to figure out where they fit into the later story I had read too soon.The StoryIt's a drug-pushin' ex-boyfriend who brings Gin's attention to a new drug setting Ashland a'fire while a new elemental magic user wielding a completely new type of magic gets Gin's curiosity up and running.But it's the threat to family that raises Gin's ire.The CharactersGin Blanco, who has Ice and Stone elemental magic, is turning thirty-one, perpetual student and do-gooder, and the retired assassin known as the Spider. Fletcher Lane was her mentor who died a year ago and left her the restaurant. Detective Bria Coolidge, one of Ashland's few good cops, is her baby sister with a gift for Ice, who somehow survived their childhood slaughter. The flirtatious, very well-dressed Finn Lane is Fletcher's son and like a brother to Gin. He's also quite the sharpshooter.\"Finn also ostensibly worked as an investment banker, although shameless, greedy money launderer would have been a far more accurate description of his job.\"Owen Grayson is a metal elemental and in love with Gin. Eva Grayson is Owen's baby sister. Violet Fox is Eva's best friend. Warren T. Fox is Violet's grandfather. Phillip Kincaid is back to being one of Owen's friends; he's also hip-deep in the criminal factions with his floating casino, the Delta Queen. Gustav is his chef.The Pork Pit is\u2026\u2026a barbecue restaurant left to Gin by Fletcher. And damn, if Estep doesn't half make me hungry for barbecue and coleslaw! Sophia Devereaux, a goth dwarf, is the head cook with a talent for Air magic and very helpful in disappearing bodies. Catalina Vasquez works as a waitress there while she attends college. Silvio is her uncle. Laura was Catalina's mother. Jolene \"Jo-Jo\" Devereaux is Sophia's sister and also has an Air power. She uses hers to heal Gin up in between making the beauty queen wanna-bes and their mamas look good in her beauty salon. Cooper Stills is a dwarven blacksmith and Jo-Jo's beau.Ashland PDThe giant Detective Xavier is Bria's partner, and he's in love with Roslyn. Cassie works in the lab.Roslyn, a vampire who owns Northern Aggression, a decadent, after-hours bar. Lisa is her sister; Catherine is Lisa's daughter.Silvio Sanchez is the smart, vicious second-in-command to Beauregard Benson, the drug-dealing vampire king of Southtown with Air magic. And Beau has got a magic that is absolutely terrifying. Johnny, Derrick, and Joan are some of his guards.Troy Mannis is a childhood friend of Catalina's whom she wants nothing to do with anymore. Max Young is a young snitcher. Jonah McAllister had been Mab's lawyer, and he has an itch to take Gin down hard. Lorelei Parker and Ron Donaldson are some of the other underworld bosses.

Coral is a hooker Gin saved when she was on the streets. Reggie is her pimp.The Cover and TitleThe cover has a poisonous look to it with all that green. The green tinted rock with Gin's rune drawn on in blood, dripping down the battered wall. A belligerent Gin with her arms crossed and in a cocky stance in a deep green tank top, her silverstone knives in sheaths at her waist like six-guns, her black jeans painted on. There's more green in the soft pastel gradient in Poison as it wraps itself around the golden Promise.The title is what Gin will provide, a Poison Promise for a poisonous man."}, {"userName": "Katie Michaels", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4669344-katie-michaels", "userReview": "I think I enjoyed this Elemental Assassin story more than I have any installment in a long time. The series hasn\u2019t been the same for me since Widow\u2019s Web, for a number of reasons. I\u2019ve had serious issues with romantic arc. And we\u2019ve been missing a villain of Mab Monroe\u2019s caliber for Gin to face. The stories have felt more like standalones, not building toward anything. Frankly, I was just losing interest. Until now.In the wake of Mab\u2019s death, Gin has been trying to keep a low profile, but the bad guys of Ashland have been targeting her, trying to make a name for themselves by taking out the Spider. Obviously in Ashland, evil equals stupid, because everyone underestimates her and ends up dead. Anyway, this time around, Bria is more of a target than Gin. She\u2019s been trying to take down a big-time drug dealer and he\u2019s had just about enough of her interference. He takes out one of her informants, essentially making her more determined than ever to put him behind bars. She\u2019s even willing to put a potential witness at risk to get her conviction. But Gin isn\u2019t about to let anyone get to her baby sis \u2013or her young waitress who witnessed Benson\u2019s crime. So she ends up right in the middle of the brewing war with a powerful vampire who can suck the emotion (and life) out of anyone he touches.I guess I am finally over the Owen thing. His character took a real hit for me for several books. But Jennifer Estep seems to have put all of his stupidocity behind him and let him be a good boyfriend again. If I let myself think about it, I still get mad, but the Owen in this story is back to the supportive and generous man I Gin fell in love with. This is a good thing, since Bria takes a major step backward, landing firmly back in the selfish immature bubble where we saw her in By a Thread. I wanted to jump in the book and smack her in the face. I question how she could show such utter disregard and frankly, unkindness, to a sister that she has been building a relationship for all of this time. I get her focus and determination, but callousness to those that love her is not ok. And I am never down with people hurting Gin\u2019s feelings.There are two things I really liked about this story. The first is that I felt like we\u2019re rebuilding a big picture. True, we haven\u2019t seen Benson before, but he ties into the structure of the underworld and sets us up with the Big Bad we\u2019ve been waiting for. Our villains come full circle and I like where Estep is going here. The second, it\u2019s just ultimately so empowering for Gin. As always, she has to endure some pretty hard knocks achieve victory (and I cursed Bria\u2019s name the whole time) but I loved the climax and what it means for Gin\u2019s future.I have stayed with this series, even when it disappointed me, because Gin is such a great character. I love her balance of strength and vulnerability. I love the way she protects people the way no one but Fletcher ever protected her. How she is willing to sacrifice herself, not only for those she loves, but for the innocent. How she can kill without blinking an eye. Yet she still struggles with insecurities and a desire to be loved that\u2019s deeper than she even realizes.It\u2019s not perfect. Other than Bria\u2019s regression, I found myself kind of annoyed with the repetition. I feel like we hear in every book how Gin takes \u201cher little white pills\u201d but she and Owen use condoms just to be safe. Just put the condom on, for crying out loud. And I think Estep worked in the term \u201cpoison promise\u201d three times, which was twice too many.But overall, I liked it. And I am actually kind of excited to see what\u2019s going to happen next.Rating: B*ARC Provided by Pocket Books"}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3813571-anne", "userReview": "Read this in one go last night when I received a free copy from Netgalley in exchange for my honest review, couldn't wait to start. Hard to believe it was 416 pages it went so fast.While the story line about illegal drugs is quite ordinary, as with everything in Gin's world, this is ratcheted up a notch. The bad guys are vampires, with the head bad guy being even more special, the drug, Burn, has special properties too and effects all including supes and elementals.What I appreciate about this series, and this book especially, is that we really get to see inside Gin. We are let in to how she is feeling and why she does what she does, more than just the revenge for her family. There's also a great cast of secondary characters, many of whom get to play an important role in Poison.I knew who the auburn haired woman was from the beginning and what role she more obviously played in Poison, but like Gin, there were surprises in store for me.This is a phenomenal series and Poison Promise is right up there as one of my favorites. For those new to the series, start with book 1, Spider's Bite, and work your way through to Poison Promise. You'll enjoy them all and I think you'd enjoy Poison more knowing the characters' back stories.

When Gin happens upon a drug deal gone bad that involves one of her employees, the Spider steps in.This is one of my favorite UF series! Gin is a total bad ass! She's a bit of a reluctant assassin because she doesn't take just any job. However, if a person threatens her friends, family, or an innocent~ she takes care of business. The other thing that I really enjoy about this series, is that she doesn't have to be the lone Hero. Everyone in her inner circle has a role in the success of The Spider. She might be the one who ultimately dispatches the villains but she's never quite alone in it. And her inner circle keeps growing! I really liked the new \"addition\" becoming her personal assistant, lol. The Spider is becoming the top Powerhouse in Ashland, whether she likes it or not.We also get a nice little introduction to the next villain. The one we've been waiting on. We knew she was coming but it's more of a package deal. I'm definitely eager to see how that turns out.The reason for 3.5 stars is simple, Bria.

Really? There is literally nothing there. Gin and Owen could have been brother and sister, if they didn't sleep with one another.No love, no flames, no passion.

Naturally, Gin can\u2019t let that continue, and her actions set into motion a series of events that will have Gin facing off with Ashland\u2019s most notorious drug kingpin. Just another day in the life of the Spider\u2026Opening Sentence: \u201cSomeone has a birthday coming up.\u201dThe Review:All I can say right now is I freaking love this series so much. I can\u2019t even tell you why. It\u2019s not like each book is unique. They\u2019re not. There is a very simple formula to the plot of each one. And yet, each and every time, I find myself sucked into the world of Ashland and the story of the latest villain to try and take on the notorious assassin the Spider. This book was no different. I started it over my lunch hour, and by the end of that time period, I was 30% in and so hooked I wanted to take off the rest of the afternoon so I could just read. Again, I love this series.Things are business as usual for Gin: running the Pork Pit, taking classes at the local college for fun, and dealing with the occasional thug who thinks he/she will be the one to finally take down the Spider. High on her list of worries right now is dealing with her foster brother Finn\u2019s plans for a surprise birthday party for her. He always manages to do it, even though the \u201csurprise\u201d portion of the party always makes her want to reach for her knives. All in all, life is as calm as it\u2019s ever going to get for Gin Blanco.Then on her way to her car after class, Gin sees one of her waitresses being harassed by a drug dealer and two vampires. Turns out there\u2019s a new drug on the streets known as Burn, and this guy\u2019s wanting his ex-girlfriend to help spread the word around campus. She refuses, and the situation escalates from there. Gin\u2019s not about to let someone she knows wind up hurt or dead, so she steps in, as only she can. After this event, Gin attracts the notice of Ashland\u2019s most notorious drug kingpin, a vampire who can feed on emotions as well as blood, with devastating results. As tensions rise, it becomes clear that soon, only one of them is going to breathing soon. Will the Spider be able to come out on top again?There\u2019s not much I can say about Gin that I haven\u2019t already said in my reviews of previous books in the series. Suffice to say, I love her as the main character. The first person narration gives the reader a great view of both the kickass side of her character, as well as the side that\u2019s more vulnerable. There is also something about the way Gin\u2019s voice is written that is just uniquely Gin to me. I always know when I\u2019m reading an Elemental Assassin book, and that is a very good thing.It\u2019s probably best to read this book only if you\u2019ve read the others in the series in order to fully connect to the various characters (and to be able to fully appreciate the significance of the ending). As with all Elemental Assassin books, there is a ton of action. Once the plot is set in motion, there\u2019s no slowing down. The end is guaranteed to make fans of this series eager for more. I know I am!Notable Scene:\u201cSiblings fight,\u201d Owen said. \u201cYou know that. Eva and I have had some doozies over the years. We have always managed to find a way to get past it. You and Bria will too.\u201dI sighed and snuggled down deeper into the couch cushions.\u201cI do know that, all of that. But you should have seen Bria tonight. She was practically foaming at the mouth at the thought of using Catalina\u2019s testimony against Benson. It reminded me of\u2026\u201d\u201cYourself?\u201dOwen\u2019s voice was gentle, but I still winced all the same.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cBria\u2019s a cop,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s just as tough as and strong as you are, and when she has a job to do, she doesn\u2019t let anything get in her way. The two of you are eerily similar that way. Must be a Snow family trait.\u201dHis teasing tone brought a ghost of a smile to my face, but it fled all too quickly, and my gray gaze drifted up to the fireplace mantel, where a series of framed drawings perched.The runes of my family, dead and otherwise.My mother Eira Snow\u2019s snowflake, for icy calm. My older sister Annabella\u2019s ivy vine, representing elegance. Their matching silverstone pendants draped over their respective drawings. The neon pig sign outside the Pork Pit that I\u2019d drawn in honor of Fletcher. Owen\u2019s hammer for strength, perseverance, and hard work. And finally, Bria\u2019s primrose, symbolizing beauty.\u201cShe\u2019s always going to be my baby sister,\u201d I replied, staring at the primrose drawing. \u201cThe one whose hair I used to brush while she drank invisible tea and chattered nonsense to her dolls.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Owen said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t protect her forever, Gin. At some point, you have to let go.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to let go. Because every time I did, I lost someone else I cared about. I\u2019d watched my mom disappear in a ball of Mab\u2019s elemental Fire. I\u2019d let Annabella pound down the stairs at our house, and she\u2019d been burned to ash by Mab too. I\u2019d left Fletcher to go do a job as the Spider, which turned out to be a trap, and he\u2019d been tortured to death in his own restaurant.So no, I wasn\u2019t letting go. I wasn\u2019t losing Bria too because I\u2019d stood by and failed to act. Even if I was still angry and hurt by all of her harsh words and actions tonight.\u201cGin?\u201d Owen asked.\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d I said, lying through my teeth. \u201cI should let Bria handle this one.\u201dWe talked for a few more minutes. Owen promised to come by the Pork Pit for lunch tomorrow, and I told him how much I appreciated him letting me vent. Then we hung up.I tossed my phone down onto the coffee table, making the fork rattle on my empty plate. I stared at the fork, then at the runes on the mantel, then back at the fork.What the hell.

Being the famous assassin \u201cThe Spider\u201d has its drawbacks and that is one of them. Gin\u2019s sister, detective Bria has her sights on Beauregard \u201cBeau\u201d Benson, drug lord and king of Southland who is pushing a new drug called Burn. But Bria\u2019s obsession with Beau is putting not only her life in danger but that of those around her.Gin has retired from her \u201cprofession\u201d, but when the people she cares about are threatened she has to stepped up and do what she does best, take her Silverstone knives out to play. The only problem is that Beau is not her usual enemy; he\u2019s a sadistic vampire with a special magic that lets him feed from other people\u2019s emotions.The good thing is that Gin is not alone, she has a group of friends willing to help her every step of the way.I have to be honest, I\u2019ve been going through a kind of reading slump and I\u2019m not enjoying much the books I\u2019ve been reading. Even though I knew and felt this book was better than previous couple of books in the series, I just couldn\u2019t get into it as much as I wanted. I\u2019m blaming it on me, not on the book. I think it was one of those \u201cit\u2019s me, not you\u201d cases.Saying that, I can say I liked Gin in this book, I liked that we see her tough side and her insecure side. That\u2019s what makes her a remarkable heroine. She is not perfect, she\u2019s not omnipotent, she has insecurities, and knows she has limitations. Still, she does what needs to be done to protect those she cares about.In this installment she\u2019s tired of hiding and comes out in the open. She knows that now that she has publicly proclaimed to be The Spider things will be more interesting for her and consequently for those around her.One good thing about Poison Promise was that I felt love for Owen again. What he did in previous books is now in the past and he\u2019s back to be the perfect man for Gin.Finn is the perfect sidekick. He can kick ass when necessary and at the same time he brings the comedy relief to balance the story. He loves Gin and has always been there for her. I really couldn\u2019t like him more.Now we have come to Bria, OMFG! Bria! I wanted to slap her more than once. What happened to her? She used to be a pain in the neck for Gin then she accepted her for what she was (an assassin and her sister) and now, in this installment she is back being a prick! She said many hurtful things and was very judgmental about Gin\u2019s life. She not only hurt Gin deeply, she also put her life in danger.Later on she regretted her actions, but I can\u2019t helped but think that deep down Bria still feels and thinks that way about Gin, if not, she wouldn\u2019t have said those hurtful things.In Poison Promise we see everything we expect from the books in this series, non-stop action, violent confrontations, creepy villains, Gin getting her ass kicked and kicking ass.In this installment we finally meet M.M. Monroe and even though I guessed who she was, I can\u2019t help but feel that what is to come for Gin are things we have seen before (first books). I really hope I\u2019m mistaken and the new villains won\u2019t be new versions of Mab Monroe and her cronies, because that would be very disappointing.Poison Promise is a great addition to a great series. I recommend reading these books in order to get the full effect of the Elemental Assassin series.I\u2019m looking forward to next book in the series, Black Widow, to be released on November 25th."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4295616-jennifer", "userReview": "Originally posted at The Book Nympho\u00a0While this review will be spoiler free for Poison Promise, it does make references to previous books.

So it's no wonder she's not excited about her birthday. Plus\u00a0Finn, her foster-brother and wing man ALWAYS throws her a surprise every year even when she tells him not to. But before Finn has a chance to throw confetti at Gin the local drug dealer in Southtown throws bullets and other non-party favors at her.Let's talk about that drug dealer. Estep writes some great villains! Beauregard Benson is a great example. He's a nerdy vampire that fancies himself a scientist that dresses in white pants, sneakers, bow ties, glasses and a pocket protector. And he drives a baby-blue Bentley that makes even Finn drool. But don't let his outer appearance fool you. He is one evil dude. No one since Mab Monroe has come so close to taking out The Spider.Benson really does a number on Gin. Where Mab and others have physically beaten Gin, Benson did some real mind games on Gin. And as we know sometimes the mind games stay with you longer than the physical hurts.Gin's been dealing with the fall out of taking down Mab for months. All the Ashland under lords and lackeys have been making attempt after attempt on taking down The Spider but after Poison Promise Gin has changed the game and it's going to be very interesting to see how the underworld handles it.The only thing keeping me from giving Poison Promise\u00a05 stars is Bria. After all this time and all the things she's seen, Bria is still judging Gin about being The Spider. I'm hoping after Poison Promise she's finally learned her listen and we won't see this kind of judgement thinking from her again. Really, how many times does Gin have to save her butt for her to get off her soapbox.Poison Promise\u00a0is full of the quality story telling and characters I've come to expect from Jennifer Estep, and I can't wait to read\u00a0Black Widow."}, {"userName": "Annie (Under the Covers Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2489554-annie-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "Very rarely do you find a series that gets better with each instalment. In book eleven of the Elemental Assassin series, POISON PROMISE delivers a refreshingly action-paced story featuring Urban Fantasy\u2019s favourite assassin.Gin Blanco continues to kick ass in this book but when her sister and cop, Bria gets her thoughts muddled on trying to capture the latest bad guy on her list, Gin wants her sister to know that taking out the bad guy isn\u2019t just about killing, it\u2019s also about thinking about the victims as well.Estep places an emphasis on the crimes of Beauguard. I have to say that I\u2019ve really enjoyed the villains in this series but so far, the current ones are my favorites. With their strong motivations, you come to believe each character despite the fact that you\u2019re supposed to be on Gin\u2019s side. When you have that great of a character opposite your heroine, you\u2019re bound to have igniting tension in every scene.Gin is faced with a proposition that definitely spices things up for her. I think this decision shows off Estep\u2019s expert planning. Not only is each instalment fresh with its own twists and turns, but the characters remain original and the series as a whole still has places that has yet to venture to.Additionally, Gin continues to impress me more and more. Whenever I read an Elemental Assassin book, it doesn\u2019t seem far off from a James Bond flim. As a fan of both, I think Estep has all the right elements in all the right places. The balance is hard to strike, but I feel that Estep excels at it with this series.POISON PROMISE is a lethal strike of ass-kicking action, mischief, that signature badassness that readers expect from Gin Blanco.*ARC provided by publisher"}, {"userName": "Romancing the Book", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5328566-romancing-the-book", "userReview": "Reviewed by JenBook provided by NetGalley for reviewOriginally posted at Romancing the BookI love this series. It\u2019s on my auto-buy list and I\u2019m always anxiously awaiting the next release. And this installment was no exception. I\u2019m always curious as to what new situation Gin is going to land herself in, and how she\u2019s going to get out of it.This time around, the bad guy is a drug lord named Beau Benson. Gin first learns of a new drug in town through one of her waitresses. Then she finds out that Beau is at the top of her sister\u2019s most wanted list. This dude is seriously nasty. His elemental abilities combined with his ruthlessness in business and scientific curiosity makes him quite a challenge for Gin.As always, Gin is super focused and is determined to protect her friends and family. While I admire this, it always drives me a little insane that she seems to shut out their concerns for her. And in this book, she seems to not listen even more than usual. It\u2019s probably the one thing that really wanted me to reach into the pages and shake Gin a little.The book will stand alone. But with such a long running series, it is always better to read the series in order as events from the past are brought up and relationships make more sense.This was a pretty fast read for me considering it was over 400 pages long. I just couldn\u2019t put the book down once I got started. There were some interesting twists and turns and more of Gin\u2019s past is revealed. And even better, there was some foreshadowing of what\u2019s to come for Gin. I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s coming next!"}], "description": "Gin Blanco is hard-nosed, sexy, and lethal.
