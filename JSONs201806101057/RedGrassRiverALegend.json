Si celui-ci est surnomm\u00e9 le roi des Everglades, ce n'est pas pour rien. La vie de John Ashley et celle de sa famille sont inextricablement m\u00eal\u00e9es \u00e0 cette r\u00e9gion. C'est dans ces mar\u00e9cages que John va grandir, commettre son premier m\u00e9fait, vendre l'alcool distill\u00e9 par son p\u00e8re Joe mais aussi vivre et aimer. Les Everglades sont un personnage \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re de ce roman. Dangereuses, inqui\u00e9tantes, mortelles, myst\u00e9rieuses... Mais aussi, belles, protectrices et pleines de vie pour qui les connait... elles donnent un cadre hors du commun \u00e0 cette histoire. Ce sont la modernisation des Everglades, l'urbanisation, l'augmentation de la population qui vont entra\u00eener des changements radicaux dans la vie du gang Ashley. Cette famille, connue de tout Palm Beach, amie avec le sh\u00e9rif Baker p\u00e8re, va conna\u00eetre plusieurs revirements de situation qui vont entra\u00eener sa chute. Je ne vous en dirai pas plus (il se passe beaucoup de choses dans ce roman) sinon que James Carlos Blake a parfaitement revisit\u00e9 l'histoire du gang Ashley en m\u00ealant deux voix, une premi\u00e8re raconte l'\u00e9pop\u00e9e de John Ashley tandis qu'une deuxi\u00e8me tente de ce souvenir de ce passer lointain. Alors si comme moi, vous aimez les histoires de bandits, les westerns, les romans noirs, Boardwalk Empire, la crasse de True Detective saison 1, les histoires d'amour et de famille, les m\u00e9chants attachants, les \"gentils\" plut\u00f4t m\u00e9chants, le film Il \u00e9tait une fois en Am\u00e9rique, les braquages de banque, Bonnie & Clyde, la Floride et ses crocodiles, alors vous risquez de grandement appr\u00e9cier ce roman !"}, {"userName": "JustSomeGuy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36920718-justsomeguy", "userReview": "My upstate NY library had to go out and get this book from Oklahoma State University to fulfill my request, and even though it was an older book, I could tell from the catalog card still within its pages, it looked as though only 3 other people had read it in all that time. I was surprised more people had not taken the opportunity to hear a yarn about a blood feud that spans decades with the Florida Everglades as its backdrop. I didn't find the book to be a masterpiece as some reviews glorified it as, but the author did an admirable job incorporating the history of South Florida while turning the Everglades into his most memorable character in a novel full of them. The tale of the rum-running Ashleys and the lawmen Bakers was told through the direct conflict between John Ashley and Bobby Baker, one that began in their youth, with the former stealing the girl of the latter at a dance, and ended with an immeasurable amount of bloodshed. I say immeasurable, but it would be more accurate to admit I stopped counting, as one death just began to pile on another. The repetitive cycle of bank robberies, arrests and prison escapes became tiresome, as did the teases of the showdown that would never materialize between the two until the very end, and by then, it felt anti-climactic. I fought off fatigue for the better part of the book, wanting to know the result but tiring to hear how we finally got there. A wonderfully written, sometimes long-winded, novel that too often tested my patience as a reader in order to fully enjoy it. Carve out 100 pages, 20 bankrobberies and a dozen characters, and I would have appreciated this work even more."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24437998-paul", "userReview": "\"They say it's hardly another place in the world where you can look farther & see less.

A brilliantly written book capturing a slice of life I was surprised to find fascinating. Gangsters? In the twenties? Hiding out and seeking refuge in their natural habitat, the untamed Florida Everglades? You betcha. Mr. Blake is THAT good. That's why he wins the awards. If you come across this book, don't be a fence sitter, do yourself a favor and dig in. This is one good book."}, {"userName": "Nate", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6803829-nate", "userReview": "A swamp noir epic spanning over a decade, Red Grass River begins with soon-to-be-famous bandit John Ashley navigating the Florida everglades (what Blake calls \u201cthe Devil\u2019s Garden\u201d) in search of a local Seminole man named DeSoto Tiger. Ashley only has trading with Tiger on his mind, but soon things turn violent, setting the tone for this bloody epic. Over the following years banks are robbed, rum is ran, and throats are cut aplenty. This novel kind of occupied the space and time between the traditional western era featuring criminals like John Wesley Hardin and Billy the Kid and the prohibition era with guys like Bugsy Siegel or Meyer Lansky. This novel setting, combined with Blake\u2019s no-nonsense prose and epic scope really made for great reading. It\u2019s one of those books where I only reserve the fifth star because I don\u2019t know yet if Blake can do better.The book specifically concerns the historically famous Ashley gang, led by patriarch Old Joe and filled out by his five sons and myriad others including Hanford Mobley, Ray Lynn, Roy Matthews, et al. Also holding her own in capacity for violent outlawry is John\u2019s wonderfully-named girlfriend Laura Upthegrove. Early in the book John forms a rivalry with Bob Baker, a gruff and ruthless sheriff. The war between the Bakers and the Ashleys carries on for most of the book and results in a ton of violent mayhem. It\u2019s too easy to compare Blake to Cormac McCarthy in terms of prose stylings and blood-soaked pages but it\u2019s definitely apt. I don\u2019t think Blake rises quite to the heights of brutal poetry and apocalyptic violence as readers encounter in the likes of Blood Meridian but he\u2019s no rote ripoff artist either.I think a big part of my enjoyment of this book had to do with my total lack of knowledge of the Ashley Gang. I\u2019ve read a lot about this era\u2019s gangsters but they completely passed me by, probably due to the fact they were plying their rough trade in the Floridian swamps and not the big cities of Chicago or New York. That said, these dudes and dudettes certainly can hang with the best of them. The bodies pile higher with every page and you can smell the cordite and blood mist hanging in the air after the many tense gunfights and outright murders. I also enjoyed being immersed deep in the surroundings. You can smell the marine rot, walk amongst the sawgrass and lounge in the hammock trees with the characters with ease. I can\u2019t wait to get ahold of more of Blake\u2019s stuff, especially his book about Bloody Bill Anderson. If I liked this book this much going into it with no knowledge or even a terrible lot of interest in the setting or historical context I can\u2019t see me not liking a book the author\u2019s written about one of the civil war\u2019s most famous and ruthless killers! So: if you have any interest in the prohibition era, Florida crime history, or even just two-fisted tales of murder, mayhem and sex you would do well to check this book out. There\u2019s not a lot of humor or lightness in it but these people\u2019s lives were hardly a goofy jaunt through easy pastures and Blake does them a service by presenting them as both larger-than-life folk heroes and fallible, violent human beings."}, {"userName": "Larry", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14931109-larry", "userReview": "It\u2019s clear early on that this is a book about nothing but bad people, leading bad lives, doing bad deeds. No redeeming qualities - none. So accept this or stay away from Red Grass River.The main character is John Ashley, who, along with his daddy and brothers and friends comprise a gang of bootlegging, bank-robbing, rum-smuggling, jail-breaking thugs who wreak havoc throughout south Florida circa 1914-1924. It\u2019s the Everglades mafia is what it is. And the Ashley gang has had a long running blood feud with the the Bakers, the local law enforcement family, particularly Bobby Baker. The few women we glimpse are either whores or wives or mothers blasting shotguns to shoo away enemies, that is until lady outlaw Laura Upthegrove comes into John\u2019s life so he can have true love. This is a sweaty, swampy violent tale with great writing and loads of action and strong characters."}, {"userName": "Maniissh Aroraa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11558965-maniissh-aroraa", "userReview": "Two interesting characters - A blind girl who can dream of future events and a gang leader with amazing survival skills.
