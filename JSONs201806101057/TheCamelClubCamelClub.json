But me, I follow authors. And while some people fantasize about celebrities they\u2019d like to dine with, I have a list of rock star authors I dream of interviewing.Recently, one of my dreams came true when David Baldacci agreed to an email interview with me. Upon hearing the news, my impulse was to jump and kick in a manner my legs haven\u2019t experienced since the late 1980s, when I was a high school cheerleader. I quickly discovered my body is no longer qualified in jumping and kicking. It is, however, perfectly fine sitting at a computer conducting research on a favorite author. So that\u2019s what I did. And here\u2019s what I learned: Before becoming an internationally-acclaimed bestselling author, Baldacci practiced law for nine years. He hit success with his first novel, \u201cAbsolute Power\u201d and hasn\u2019t looked back. He\u2019s written more than a dozen best sellers. Baldacci\u2019s works are translated into more than 45 languages and sold in more than 80 countries. And over 60 million copies of Baldacci's books are in print worldwide.Even I, an ardent Baldacci fan, was surprised by those statistics. And if I wasn\u2019t a fan, upon learning those stats, I\u2019d feel inclined to read a Baldacci title.A good place to start is with Baldacci\u2019s \u201cThe Camel Club.\u201d This book is the first in a series which follows a club of D.C.-based truth seekers. The club consists of an unusual mix of four members: a man without a past currently called \"Oliver Stone\"; obsessive computer genius Milton Farb; blue-collar laborer Reuben Rhodes; and Library of Congress reference specialist Caleb Shaw. In \u201cThe Camel Club,\u201d the members witness a shocking murder in a D.C.-area park. While secretly trying to unravel the crime, the foursome is slammed into a plot that threatens national security and world stability. If that\u2019s not enough to get you reading Baldacci, perhaps a taste of my interview will do it. (The full interview is available on my blog, address below.)Question: An enormous amount of research must go into your writing. Is there a particular research experience or discovery you\u2019ll always remember? Answer: Listening to incessant gunfire at Quantico while I was down there researching \u201cLast Man Standing.\u201d I felt like I was in the Middle East. Being nearly arrested by the FBI while toting around a German film crew in D.C. Ranks right up there. And then my experience on the Acela train after two passengers overheard me talking to a medical expert about poisoning someone for research for a book and summoned the police. That was fun too. Now whenever I travel, I duct tape my mouth shut just to be safe."}, {"userName": "Rita", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22264452-rita", "userReview": "Since I'm feeling better, I decided it was about time to write the review for this fantastic book. The only other David Baldacci book that I had read was Absolute Power which I enjoyed very much but it was quite a few years ago. I decided to find out what all the fuss was about this author. The next one I tried was Zero Day. I ended up throwing that one in the DNF file. The lead character, John Puller, completely left me cold. He struck me as a cardboard caricature of a military lifer would be but with no emotions. Definitely not a Jack Reacher. So on to the next one.The Camel Club was a breath of fresh air after Zero Day. \"Oliver Stone\" was a man who had been to hell and back and still cared about wrongs being done to people and his country. Despite the fact that an agency of the American government took away everything he held precious in his life, Oliver Stone still loved his country and was willing to do everything in his power to protect it. I was hooked.Milton Farb, Caleb Shaw and Reuben Rhodes comprised the remainder of \"the Camel Club\" with long term Secret Service Agent, Alex Ford, an unofficial member. They are conspiracy theorists who discovered the truth behind the theories. They know all too well that government agencies sometimes crossed lines that shouldn't be crossed.It starts with them witnessing a murder that is not just a murder. The victim was killed to make sure that something that is happening at the most powerful government agency and shouldn't be, is kept quiet. But Oliver and the rest of the Camel Club are detected in their wooden boat, and a hail of bullets put a hole in the boat and grazes one of the club members.Oliver Stone convinces Agent Ford to look into the matter and he ends up being demoted back to White House protection detail for his trouble. He stepped on toes that did not like being stepped on and were in a powerful position to get back at him for his audacity.The real point of this book, I believe, is that it is very easy for a person who believes he is a force for good to be manipulated by those who do not have good intentions. Believing that it's OK to overstep boundaries because of the greater good, will usually not work as planned. You are putting yourself in the position of being an omnipotent being while in fact you are only a human being. You mean no harm but that is usually what you get. So it seems that at times the worst enemy of the USA can be one of the bureaucracies put in place to protect it, simply because the person in charge thinks that they know what is best for the country.I really enjoyed this book and look forward to the rest of this series. I'm glad that I gave David Baldacci another chance.Posted to Goodreads and Amazon 1/20/2018"}, {"userName": "Dash Garabetovitch Kassakhov", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/144915-dash-garabetovitch-kassakhov", "userReview": "I feel cheated that I even had to assign a single star to this pathetic excuse for a book. Let me describe this book like this... this is the kind of book that comes in only two forms - paperback and audio. It's excrement smeared on paper and then bound and placed in airport bookstore shelves. It's your basic Tom Clancy bite off of the terrorist plot to bring down the free world. The author has watched a couple of National Geographic Videos, maybe had lunch with about three or four guys who used to work for the State Department, NSA or CIA and spent a year or two in the Middle East and maybe read a Barnes & Noble edition of the abbreviated history of the Middle East as research for his big political thriller. The book is utter crap and is an insult to anyone who likes political thrillers, knows anything about the Middle East and the politics of the region and anybody who just likes to read.Lesson Learned: Never buy a paperback book from an airport bookstore no matter how bored you are or how long your flight's been delayed."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "Well....here I go. I can't really recommend this one. You know there are books by Mr. Baldacci that I enjoy greatly. I have noted before that he can be...that's \"can be\" one of those authors who can get very heavy handed about their political beliefs. I find that the case here. He pretty much had me feeling he was really (really) \"mostly\" interested in making a political point. This is obviously a point to be agreed or disagreed on as I see some reviewers agree with me and others don't. Possibly it depends on how much you agree with him (Baldacci) and therefore how much that part of the book...sticks out or overwhelms the plot and characters. I don't know. You'll have to decide for yourself.Now that said, this is not the primary problem with the novel for me and it's not why I give it a low rating. The novel starts out with an idea and a cast of characters we are to get to know. The primary protagonist is \"Oliver Stone\". No not the movie maker. We have \"another\" refugee from the world of \"secret, black ops, covert...stuff\". His having taken the name of the movie maker who's interest in conspiracies is sort of legend may just have been part of the reason why the name was chosen as \"our hero's nom de plume\" Sadly however from the very first things spin out in several directions and the story gets not so much laid out with lots of threads...as it seems to \"fray\" out in all directions with the threads lashing about in the wind.It wasn't that I couldn't keep track...I just came to the point where I didn't care to.So, I don't plan to follow up with any more of the \"series\" and really can't recommend it. I just found myself to often losing interest and wanting to move on to something...interesting. Oh and as I and others have said, Mr. Baldacci's politics quickly become the only true point."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "2.0 stars. Probably would have given this 3 stars except for my extreme annoyance with the \"heavy handed\" political tone of the book. As far as I can tell from the authors depictions in the story, America is responsible for ALL of the evil in the world (especially in the Middle East), 9/11 was a justified response to American foreign policy and Americans are ignorant and racist. Great, thanks for that, now can we get on with the story. Oh, that is the story. Terrific!!!Apart from the tone, this was a fairly fast-paced read with competent writing. I may check out the next book in the series at some point as I thought the basic premise of the Camel Club was intriguing. I just hope the author focuses more on story-telling and less on rhetoric in future books."}, {"userName": "Freda Malone", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6938113-freda-malone", "userReview": "Across the street from the White House, tells a story of a man, dead and alive, Oliver Stone. Old and homeless, he and a small group of friends known as The Camel Club, witness a murder on Roosevelt Island. I read this book many years ago, but for the life of me, I could not remember very much of it. Except for the fact that Oliver Stone lived homeless across the street from the White house and was a mysterious old man. Now that I have re-read this first novel in the series, scenes and characters have come back to me, though I had to finish the book because I still couldn\u2019t remember the ending! Explosive, to say the least and so many characters involved, you really have to pay attention.A topic that stands out in this novel is the amount of veteran characters who were betrayed by their own government and the people high up in it. The president is a pompous ass who loves the cameras and doesn\u2019t seem to care much for \u2018the people\u2019, just his looks and his image. Carter Gray, the nation's intelligence chief, struck me as some kind of snake and had his own agenda and I wasn\u2019t wrong about that in the end. Alex, a CIA agent, gets a rookie partner, Jackie Simpson, who is also the daughter of a Senator. Jackie Simpson should never have transferred from beat cop to CIA, she was dumb as a door nail and I really didn\u2019t like her. She was like an annoying fly buzzing around your head and wouldn\u2019t figure things out on her own. Then of course we have a few CIA characters who were corrupt, some deranged Muslims, and some Korean ninjas. The conspiracy itself was creative and well thought out. As always with the government, things aren\u2019t what they seem. The Camel Club characters were memorable, mainly because of their atypical personalities and behaviors. Hard to picture a few old men trying to save the world though. We find out who Oliver Stone really is and he is interesting enough to continue reading the rest of the series, because my first question is, where did Oliver Stone come from? All we know in this first novel is that Oliver Stone is a force to be reckoned with and I want to read more."}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "I'm just blabbering about this read: - how insignificant we are. Why fight/appose/criticize/object to anything when we're simply not important? Depressing;- some Americans will approve of the criticism in the book, other will be furious and frustrated;- this book proves a point. How democracy is used as a weapon to control countries, a well done and straightforward explanation; sadly true as well;- a cliffhanger ending; don't want to indulge in the series, so I'm unhappy;- I liked, as in really liked, the big WHAT IF scenario in the book, not preposterous at all;- a political plot with eccentric interesting anti-hero, conspiracy theorist characters. A spy thriller with the usual James Bond, over the top, plot. Robert Ludlum, Tom Clancy, Fredrick Forsyth, John Le Carr\u00e9 fans will love this book.- there's a confusing 'message' in the book. Should Americans be proud of their weaponry? Sure. Should they be proud of the reason why they need it? uhummmm...if I was an American, I would be scared to death, instead. An angry world is an ugly enemy - is my humble opinion.Everything is too predictable. We've seen these kind of heroes in too many self-soothing/ self-congratulatory, slap-on-the-back kind of books.

Intricate plot, however, a few characters are used as mouthpieces to give long dissertations on the peaceful nature of Islam and the greed of Americans. Though his points may or may not be valid, it was delivered heavy-handedly and got tiresome.

They lead an odd existence, each with unique quirks and eccentricities, and meet each month to compare notes on what they're hearing from various inside sources. On one of these evenings, they unfortunately become witnesses to a stunning event that puts them in the middle of a situation that threatens the safety of the country and the world. There are several stories going on here that ultimately converge, which is an approach I happen to love for this genre. While it presents a challenge to keep up with all the characters, it certainly heightens the mystery, suspense and intrigue. There are quite a few twists and surprises that make it even better, ultimately leading to a pretty exciting climax, though I had some issues with some things in the ending. Political perspectives are also rampant with multiple points of view to keep it provacative.

This started ok. I wondered why the treatise on the nature of Islam, was prepared to accept that somehow the relevance of that would make itself apparent.Wrong again 20% read and starting to find it tiresome, but this was an author recommended by a friend so I ploughed on. What a lot of characters and acronyms and superheros and who the hell is this book written for? Seems to me the target audience is an adolescent youth the author is hoping to 'educate' Yet I'm thinking it more a 'Mills & Boon for boys. I never thought I'd ever see \"educate\" and Mills & Boon in the same paragraph, but there you go. The fact that I think this book has a target audience doesn't go down well with me. A book written specifically to sell rather than an outlet for the tale needing to be told.By the time I had managed to get 50% read I really couldn't take any more. I really didn't like all the extra information - seemed to me the author was trying to prove he'd done some research. Not impressed - he may have read a few things but I never got the impression that he really understood the 'research' he'd done, he merely wanted to impress the reader.

It consists of four washed up, eccentric senior gentlemen who want to make the world a better place. This premise intrigued me and made me pick up this book. Now, I have read Baldacci's Will Robie before and I liked that series. The review of the series is available here. The Camel Club is different since it does not rely on one individual to move the plot along though some members of the club are more equal than the others. This book takes the standard islamic terror plot and gives it an interesting twist. For the most part, the US is portrayed more as sinners than as being sinned against. The outlook here is far more international than I would have expected, which is good in a way.

The nuclear strike was averted by just 1 second - that sort of timing is not dramatic - it's just annoying. The characterisation was quite two dimensional and, in the case of Hemingway, quite nauseating - his accomplishments are just too unbelievable - standing on a 1 inch ledge in a gale force wind for 6 hours and being able to kill people with your fingers? Hai-ya!I don't think these extremes are necessary to make an interesting character or story and the use of them just makes the book seem ridiculous.I also found the writing very clunky and badly phrased. Some of the dialogue perhaps is accurate for the characters but the same inarticulate leaden style is in the narrative - I just found it to be very naive.As for the educational aspects - I found that, at times, patronising. Worse though is that it spoiled the continuity of the writing. Perhaps if the elements were less convoluted then it may have made the going a bit easier?

(well, not quite. The opening chapter is not in D.C.), where we meet four eccentric, once-upon-a-time effective fellows who make up a group they call The Camel Club. Each has some kind of experience and/or brilliance that makes him essential to the small assembly; and each has been successful at one time or another in his life. Now, they are only reflections of what they once were. There's Oliver Stone (his assumed name), Caleb Shaw, Reuben Rhodes, and Milton Farb, conspiracy theorists all. They meet once a month in the middle of the night to discuss recent conspiracy theories and reflect/update those they've held for years. There are other interesting characters introduced in the early pages, including Secret Service agent Alex Ford who's on the downside of his career, and Kate Adams, a Department of Justice lawyer who works as a bartender at night. Go figure that one out! We are also briefly introduced to U.S. President, James H. Brennan, and to National Intelligence Center Director, Carter Gray, among others.Stone has a tent near the White House where he watches what goes on there. His goal is to find out the \"truth\" of things. He believes the American people have been denied that most desirous of tenets. On the evening of the beginning of this story, the Camel Club meets as arranged, but in the course of their meeting they unwittingly see a terrible crime committed on Theodore Roosevelt Island. Now, they must decide what to do about it...and I'm only on page 70! More later.October 29, 2005: It's later. Life sometimes gets in the way of finishing a good book, but it's been worth three nights up too late to do it in this case.The Camel Club members find themselves in the middle of a mess, having witnessed the murder of a Secret Service agent. Another Secret Service agent, Alex Ford, angers his superiors by deciding to investigate the death further than they had planned for this intended puppet. Stone and Ford end up working together to find out what's going on as a myriad of characters come and go, some with nefarious plans up their sleeves (there may even be a traitor in the club). It seems there are traitors everywhere and it's one of those times when one doesn't know who to trust. If you are into political intrigue, conspiracy theories, espionage, terrorism and/or assassination plots and all-around political paranoia, you will love this book. It is also very clearly and very well written. I can only say I hope there are many more Stones and Fords around than Captain Jacks and, well, others.Give yourself plenty of time to read The Camel Club. There are several subplots and lots of interesting facts about many things included in the story. The primary plot is very intense and you won't want to find yourself forgetting pertinent details leading up to the \"game.\" It's enough to make the reader want to bolt the door and never leave home.

After reading the synopsis of what the book will be about, I was thrilled. But I learned the hard way that don't judge the book by it's cover. The book, as the title suggests, is  The Camel Club . It should revolve mostly around The Camel Club right? But this book gives us the impression that it will be based on them but throws stones at us by having them only in lesser part of the novel( I don't remember exactly the fraction). The book should have been named as  The Revenge of the Arabs  or  White House Down... Not Again!!! Oh man!!! That is some accusation. I am not going to go straight ahead and say not to read the book. The book is about a conspiracy plot(which IMO is not that much of a conspiracy, one would also think so) involving kidnapping of the president for god knows what until, you know, The Camel Club saves the day by a slim chance. Yey!! The intention of this was also not that great. There were also many plot holes I thought should be resolved. The book also made me think that I wasn't supposed to ask how this particular person knows so and so things.But apart from, the book stood strong in terms of the characters. The characters were the main reason I read the book till the end. The life and struggle the characters face in the world of chaos was portrayed beautifully. I loved the chemistry between the characters. The book also made me cry at the end. The pain of loosing one's daughter without knowing that it is one's daughter was the sad part of this entire novel. The book also rained on facts regarding American history, life, culture and how it affects other countries. The action scenes were completely terrific(prologue is my most fav). I would give this book 3.8 stars. I wanted to give this book 5 but due to these factors I had to lower the score. My suggestion is that the author should spend equal amounts in crafting a story well deserved to it's name and also on current affairs.

The group begins to investigate what they witnessed and becomes mixed up in a conspiracy that threatens to result in World War III. This is the first political thriller I have ever read and I was pleasantly surprised at how well I liked it. The beginning was a little slow and there were a lot of characters (and political agencies) that I had a hard time keeping straight, but once the pace picked up I really got into the stories and the interesting characters. I will probably add the next book about the Camel Club to my TBR pile."}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20940446-dianne", "userReview": "This is straight out of last night's news, well similar anyways. A lot of research has gone into the topic of Middle East/American dynamics in the writing of this not so pretty story. Baldacci, like Grisham, skillfully writes a conspiracy theory and then proves it."}, {"userName": "Kendra", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11547182-kendra", "userReview": "This is the first book in \"The Camel Club\" series. I bought the audio version to listen to while on a long road trip. I was pleased and intrigued with the early introduction of Oliver Stone and the other odd but interesting members of the Camel Club, their reaction to a murder witnessed during one of their clandestine meetings, and their flight from the murderers who discovered their presence. After that, it becomes apparent that the murder is related to a plot to do something to the president, but how it is related, and who is involved in the terrorist plot remains unclear until closer to the end. It seemed to me that after a very promising beginning, the book dragged for a large chunk of time. However, the reappearance of the Camel Club members from time to time kept me interested enough to keep listening. I'm glad I did, because the various subplots weave together slowly, and with each twist (there are many!) the story evolves into something quite different than any other. Now that I've become acquainted with the Camel Club and its members, I look forward to reading more of their adventures. My advice to anyone thinking of reading this book ~ by all means do read it, but be committed to hang in through what seems to be dead spots in the book....they are relevant to the outcome."}, {"userName": "BJ Rose", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2030200-bj-rose", "userReview": "The book started out slow, but once the author got all the characters in and established, it started to move along. It was obvious from the beginning that there was a plot against the U.S., and except for Captain Jack, we knew who the 'bad guys' were, and slowly got some of the why. But the purpose, and the actual carrying out of the plot - there were some surprises there. I had to stay up late last night - once the trap was sprung, I couldn't stop.As with all political thrillers, I find myself wondering how much has basis in fact and how much is total fabrication (the description of Murder Mountain, for example). I liked the play on names - the leader of the Camel Club is 'Oliver Stone', which we know almost from the beginning is not his real name. The Camel Club is a group of four 'old fogies' who keep an eye on the doings in D.C. - they are fascinating characters, and I will read the next in this series. This wasn't really a 4* read for me because of that very slow start, but much too strong to be just a 3*"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/650953-jennifer", "userReview": "I have to confesss that I rarely read NY Times bestseller books until recently, but I've found, since listening to audiobooks, that I really enjoy them for fun listening. The Camel Club  has all the action and excitement of a good thriller film or TV show, but has enough political smarts to have some weight. There are some info-dump and/or soapbox moments, but I didn't mind so much, because Baldacci includes them to send the message that most things in politics and the Culture Wars is gray, and that so-called terrorists and protectors have complex motivations, and sometimes it's difficult to distinguish one from the other, good guys from bad guys.P.S. I like that the main character is only kind of an action hero, and that the Camel Club is a group of eccentric old men who eneryone thinks is crazy."}, {"userName": "Corey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12949855-corey", "userReview": "This was an interesting book, a good book to start the Camel Club series, some of the book was hard to follow because there was just so much going on and so many characters and for a while you don't know how some of them relate to the plot of the story, but in the end it all starts to come together. The Camel Club is a group of people led by presumed deceased John Carr who is now known as Oliver Stone, and they witness the murder of a man, and they are the only ones who witness it, they are now trying to discover the truth behind the murder.Now that I've read the first book in the series, I plan on reading the other books as well."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6908981-james", "userReview": "A good story with characters you care about.

During one of their secretive meetings, they witness a murder that leads to a chase on the misty Potomac. They must determine why this murder was deemed a suicide before the murderers find them. They seek to get the agent in charge of looking into this suicide to look more closely without telling him they were there as most of the camel club would be highly suspect themselves. I found this book to be a real page turner. I couldn't put it down. The events that start with a murder on Roosevelt Island turn into the very real possibility of nuclear launch. A very suspenseful story and well worth the read. The characters are quirky and each a bit different. Looking forward to seeing them all in the next in the series."}, {"userName": "Vikas", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3633211-vikas", "userReview": "This book proved to me how essential it is to re-read your books. I had read this book way back in 2007-2008 but I remembered almost none of it and when I read it again it was like I had never read it but I did and I did few parts but mis-remembered few parts too. And it was slow but good read. It was a nice thriller and loved the antics of the camel club. I recently bought lot of David Baldacci books and having just finished 'Jack Reacher' series well all the books printed thus far I thought of finishing Mr. Baldacci's series's this time so the mission started with 'The Camel Club' and I will move from this, first to the other books to this series and then to other series by Mr. Baldacci.'The Camel Club' is a group of few old men who have sworn to uphold and find the truth and all are discarded from the society, they keep an eye on the society by staying on it's margins. They live in Washington D.C. and keep an eye on the political going ons, and thus begin an adventure when they witness a killing but the story moves while they find the truth about the death of the man on the island.I loved it when I read it back in 2007 when I hadn't read many books and loved it now as well having read more than 600 books.

Stone wantrouwt al jarenlang de Amerikaanse regering en is ervan overtuigd dat allerlei zaken die het daglicht niet kunnen verdragen, in de doofpot worden gestopt. Hij ziet het als zijn missie om de waarheid boven tafel te krijgen. Stone staat niet alleen in zijn achterdocht. Samen met enkele vrienden bespreekt hij regelmatig hoe het Amerikaanse volk op de hoogte kan worden gebracht van de leugens die de politici en de geheime diensten verspreiden. De waarheid is echter dat de samenzweringen die zij zien, alleen in hun verbeelding bestaan. Hun theorie\u00ebn zijn vergezocht en het bewijs flinterdun. Maar dan zijn de mannen op een dag bij toeval getuige van de moord op een medewerker van de Secret Service. Omdat zij weten dat niemand hen zal geloven, besluiten Stone en zijn vrienden de zaak zelf uit te zoeken.
