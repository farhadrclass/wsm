And quietly beautiful, as well.If you've come here looking for magical realism, I would advise against it. Exit West contains only the barest of fantastical elements - essentially, metaphorical doors or portals that symbolize the migrant experience. This is not explored in any depth and serves only to propel the characters from their unnamed homeland to Greece, then London, then America.Exit West is really about the relationship between the young couple, Saeed and Nadia, and how their experiences as migrants in foreign countries affects who they are and what they need. Held together by a shared past, they try to cling to one another, even as they grow into very different people. It's subtle and exquisitely bittersweet.The book starts in a country in the middle of political turmoil. The country is not named, but that is not really the point, for it could be any country in the middle of crisis. Any country that forces its people to try to seek out a better life elsewhere. When Saeed's mother is killed and the threat of violence becomes too much, Saeed and Nadia talk to a man who promises to get them out.They are both irreparably changed by the move to new places that are at once both comforting and unwelcoming. I think the power of this book lies in the lack of manipulation and sentimentality. In many ways, it's just a love story between two vibrant, pot-smoking young people who are affected by forces beyond their control.It is these kind of quietly moving stories that affect me most of all. Authors who try to create dramatic, tear-inducing scenes never move me emotionally, but those who craft scenes of gentle truth can totally rip my heart out.

Hamid's writing is lush and evocative and so, so beautiful. The story of immigration is incredibly important for today, but it's told in a timeless fashion; the magical realism is done so tastefully and imaginatively and works so well for the story. He probes into the minds of our two main characters, Nadia and Saeed, in such a way that you truly inhabit their experiences. It's a touching and powerful story that I think will be getting a lot of buzz this year, as it deserves."}, {"userName": "Barry Pierce", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4593541-barry-pierce", "userReview": "I rarely ever do this, but I'm rating and reviewing this even though I haven't finished it. I just cannot continue. Exit West is one of the most bitterly disappointing and downright awful novels I have read in a long while. The novel begins with Nadia and Saeed, a couple living in an unnamed Middle-Eastern city. This setting and story is what we come to expect from Hamid, who also wrote the flawed but admirable The Reluctant Fundamentalist. The city is crumbling around Nadia and Saeed, blackouts are frequent, the water supply is often cut and drones hover overhead at all times. But yet, despite these enormous setbacks and struggles, they live on. If the novel were just the couple and their fight to live in their city, then what a wonderful book it would have been. I truthfully absolutely loved these initial scenes. They are a fascinating study of a couple in wartime. But then Hamid fucks everything up.Hamid, possessed by his own ego and the spirit of Salman Rushdie, decides that this perfectly serviceable novel needs something extra. A little bit of magic needed to be injected into the story. Literally. For some unknown reason, Hamid has these magical doors pop up all around the world. Doorways that lead you to anywhere in the world. You step into a door in the Middle East and suddenly you are on Mykonos. This concept sounded familiar to me, but I couldn't pinpoint it exactly. So I read on.It is inevitable that our couple is shown to one of these doors and are whisked away from their city and their lives. The second they step foot into the magical door is when the novel goes from fairly good to absolute shit. Why did Hamid add this ridiculous conceit to this novel? Why would he sabotage himself like this? I tried to ignore all door nonsense, but then it happened again. Hamid completely abandoned his great story of a couple in wartime to focus on his stupid doors. And then it hit me. I knew where I had seen this concept before.It's Monsters Inc. This book is fucking Monsters Inc.The moment I realised this I just could not continue. I had to end it. And thus we are here. I'd like to say that I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed but I am angry and disappointed. Hamid's ridiculous urge to write magical realism is possibly one of the most ill-fated attempts at cross-genre literature ever. It could have been so great if his editor had just said, hey Mohsin, you have a great novel here but all this door shit has to go. It's a shame. Think of what we could have had."}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "Sam, I have you to thank for this one.\"In a city swollen by refugees but still mostly at peace, or at least not yet openly at war, a young man met a young woman in a classroom and did not speak to her.\"So begins Mohsin Hamid's extraordinary new novel, \nExit West\n. At once both sharply current and dreamily magical, this book is social commentary, fantasy, and an emotion-laded look at how we crave connection even in the most chaotic, the bleakest of times.While reading this book, all I could think of was:\n\n\nWhen Saeed and Nadia first meet in a night class, they both are intrigued with each other, but neither acts on it. In an unnamed country beset by impending civil war, pursuing a romantic relationship isn't high on either one's priority list. Nadia is fiercely independent, living alone, and not afraid of embracing her sensuality, while Saeed is more contemplative, quiet, and less sure of himself.They first pursue a friendship, and then both begin to realize just how much they come to rely on each other, intellectually, emotionally, and socially. When the warring factions begin exerting their power over the country, enforcing curfews, restricting electricity, cutting phone signals and internet coverage, each worries about the other's safety, and their feelings for each other grow, if not quite into love for both, at least something stronger than friendship.\"Dramatic circumstances, such as those in which they and other new lovers in the city now found themselves, have a habit of creating dramatic emotions, and furthermore the curfew served to conjure up an effect similar to that of a long-distance relationship, and long-distance relationships are well known for their potential to heighten passion, at least for a while, just as fasting is well known to heighten one's appreciation for food.\"As full-on violence and terror ebb and flow, and tragedy strikes, the two become even closer. They despair over their future, whether they will survive the war, and where it will leave them. More and more, they hear rumors of doors, doors which somehow can help people like them escape far away from the violence\u0097although not without risk, and not without great cost. At first, the thought of leaving seems cowardly and wrong, but the more the violence escalates, they realize they have no choice. After much trepidation, they find a door and see where it leads.At this point, \nExit West\n's plot becomes a little dreamier, but still equally present and powerful, as it not only examines the effects strife, stress, and constant fear and suspicion have on a relationship, but it's also a pointed look at the refugee experience, and how people in the same situation can treat each other.This book worked for me on so many levels. At a time in our world where some wish to label all immigrants in a negative way, this is a stark reminder of why so many flee their countries, and how their humanity is often lost in the process. But beyond the social and philosophical commentary, this book is, at its heart, a story of relationships, of love, of loss, and the sacrifices we make for those we love.\"...he understood, at some level, that to love is to enter into the inevitability of one day not being able to protect what is most valuable to you.\"Hamid is an extraordinary writer. For as many quotes as I pulled from the book for this review, I found hundreds more. His prose is dazzling, his imagery at once sublime and gritty, and the emotions he generates from this story are genuine, not manipulated. This is a book that has touched me, one which has made me think and feel, one which I will remember and linger over.For some, the fantastical elements of the plot may not work, but if you allow yourself to become fully immersed in the entire experience, hopefully you will savor it as I have. This is simply fantastic.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo...."}, {"userName": "Ariel", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6536286-ariel", "userReview": "Very fascinatingly, I think I would have liked this book more if I had never read the synopsis. The synopsis makes it sound like we're going to have two lovers who are in a city that is becoming a war zone and then discover magical doors that lead them far away and it's hard but they have each other. That's definitely what happens... but it's also really not what happens. I'd say that's the first third of this book. If I were to give a synopsis it would be: Two people meet and because their city becomes a war zone they find themselves as refugees that aren't sure about their premature dependancy on each other. Do you see how that's the same but also really different? Did I think this book was great? Yes. Mohsin Hamid is a great writer who had a great idea and really knows how to deliver subtle but powerful moments. His story of these refugees, and refugees from all over the world, actually exposed me to a new way of thinking. I think reading this book made me a better person. You know how people often say that they read books because they want to learn about new perspectives? This is it. This will teach you to empathize, to consider others more complexly.And so I feel cheated in a way. Had I actually known that I was going to be reading about two people suffering immensely as they find themselves stranded around the world in a new relationship that they're not sure about rather than thinking I was reading about two lovers who are on a hard but whimsical tale I wouldn't have kept thinking \"wait, this isn't what I thought... huh?!\" while reading it.That's the power of marketing. When I look at this book on my shelf now I'm just a little confused.

We need more books like this, or no, maybe that's wrong, what we need are more readers of books like this. The country it takes place is unnamed, but one part makes it sound as if it is in Asia somewhere. A country under siege by opposing parties, a country at war with itself, a dangerous place, how so many in this world live in constant danger, constant war.Saeed and Nadia meet, forge a relationship, when their country erupts in violence, it becomes unlivable. They seek ways to leave, hire a coyote who is able to find doors, some literal but in this case fantastical, pay him, try to convince Saeed's father to come with, the only viable parent between the two, but he refuses, His dead wife is buried here, and this is his home. Eventually they will step through more doors, after each location losing a bit more of themselves. Trying to find a place where they feel they can exist. Refugees among many, they are not wanted, tarred and judged by those among them who are making trouble. All painted with the same brush. From a deserted mansion, to a tent city to the coast of California, they will travel, two among many, all seeking the same thing, continent to continent, all fleeing their own countries. Although the description describes this as a bittersweet love story, it is not written emotionally, rather narrated by a omnipresent presence, in a rather matter of fact way. I liked this and didn't, the feelings and things described often seemed at a distance. The situation though is universal, important and timely and so it could be said that telling the story this way lets the reader form his or her own opinions. The magical realism, is used well, fleetingly and adds to the the main message of the story, the refugees seeming to come from everywhere, so many war torn countries.

In an unnamed city in an unnamed Middle Eastern country (not unlike the similarly themed  Guapa by Saleem Haddad), two young professionals (Saeed, a quiet, pious man who lives with his parents and works for an advertising firm specializing in billboards and bus placards; and Nadia, an enigmatic \"black-robe\" wearing, motorcycle riding, lone wolf of a woman who works at an insurance agency) cross paths while taking a class at a college. It's not immediately clear what the attraction is between the two (perhaps just the uncertainty of warring militants wreaking havoc on their respective neighborhoods and the government's iron-fisted response resulting in massive bloodshed and escalating body counts from combatants and civilians alike) but the two uneasily bond, navigating the imposed curfews, dodging the outbreaks of terroristic violence to provide companionship for each other. As the violence escalates, massive blackouts, food and water shortages ensue, and Saeed and Nadia are forced to stay away from their jobs and hole up in their apartments, caught in the crossfire between the insurgent militants and the government's bombing raids. As life in the city becomes increasingly untenable, they decide to flee for their lives. And that's when the bottom falls out for me, when the hyperrealism of the couple's plight, so vividly and convincingly displayed by Hamid in the first half of the novel, takes a bizarre CS Lewis-ian turn toward  unreality (in a way, reminiscent of Cora's flight north from the slave hunter in  The Underground Railroad), using scattered, secret doors as portals for Saeed's and Nadia's means for escape. I liked Hamid's idea, but his choice (in contrast to the extremely well-written set-up) just left me lost in the lurch. From that point (of taking a turn toward speculative fiction) onward, everything felt hastily written and not especially thought out well. Compounding matters is the very skimpy length (an additional 75 pages or so more could have afforded a much better explanation for those doors, and what happens beyond them). Things that I enjoyed about Hamid's writing style in the first half really started annoying me the more I became frustrated (the two biggest problems: the run-on, grammatically unsound sentences, and the dearth of dialogue between characters.)I'm glad I read this novel, as its subject matter is timely and salient, and allowed me to finally be acquainted with Mr. Hamid's work, but ultimately,  Exit West didn't quite work for me. More patient readers than I am might be able to abide his flights of fancy here, but I was left cold by this strange take on the refugee experience."}, {"userName": "Adina", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22189348-adina", "userReview": "I finished Exist West almost a month ago and my review will reflect that because I tend to quickly forget details. Yeah, my memory is not that good. It took me a while to write a review due to a combination of hectic days at work and a new kitty at home (our first one). Waiting so long to review also had its perks as I decided to change my rating from 4 to 3. I did not remain with the impression that it was a book that I would warmly recommend. Also, I was lucky to read the much better Home Fire, another book by A Pakistani writer nominated for the Booker prize. The book has as center theme the plight of being a refugee and I believe the relevance of the subject in today\u2019s world is what makes the short novel so successful. Mohsin tells the story of two young people from an unknown Muslim state, Nadia and Saeed, who fell in love and decide to flee from the country plagued by war. In Exit West, the refugee crisis takes Apocalyptic proportions due to the use of a fantasy device. Refugees use doors to travel to safer countries, doors that randomly transform into passages to another place. Due to this gimmick there are no more painful and perilous voyages in the cold waters of the Mediterranean or on land which, in my opinion, is a loss. I would have liked to read about the trip part in the refugee\u2019s life. I might have added drama and warmth to the character's story line. I did not like the characters too much and I could not warm up to them and their plight. I did enjoy how the book was written and constructed but the somewhat forced smartness made me detached to the story. I don\u2019t know if I am making too much sense but this is how I felt. ***Review to come next week, I hope. This was the first novel that I've read from the Booker Longlist.

Nadia is living alone - as a young single female. When she leaves her flat, she wears a flowing black robe over her jeans and sweater which completely covers every inch of her body. This is her choice. Why would a modern thinking young woman - who rides a motorbike - who attends business classes - who chooses to live alone -who buys her own pot and psychedelic mushrooms for her own recreational pleasures-'also' choose to 'cover up' her body -during times when other young people her age are not? Nadia is not religious- and doesn't pray. 'Seems' Nadia black robe doesn't fit everything else about her. It is far from peaceful times. Beneath the surface of things....Militants are creating turmoil. Tensions grow - violence grows - an ugly - gut wrenching scene takes place in a bank -intimately & globally....I couldn't stop thinking about this scene --AS MUCH AS I WANTED TO. The scene was so irrational to me. It felt like Nadia's whole world shifted in that moment. And on the bigger scale -- I felt the whole world really 'did' shift....in a matter of seconds!! Saeed and and Nadia each have very different types of personalities. As enticing and seductive as it was to bask in their togetherness, they actually had a very complicated relationship during very complicated times. There relationship continues to change as their circumstances do, too. Leaving their 'no name' city-of-violence and injustice was as easy as going down the rabbit hole.....or in \"Exit West\", Saeed and Nadia simply needed to walk through the \"mysterious doors\".The 'doors' are a quick transitions to journey 'west'. I liked the way the author told this story. Rather than focus on the struggles of escaping - leaving a country at war....( such as I've read in Holocaust stories), we are quickly able to step into the new country with our leading characters. What will Saeed and Nadia find on the other side of loss? What sits for all migrants when uprooted? displaced?  And.....BEFORE departing from home - from family - before the hugs......How does this feel?  \"Saeed's Father then summoned Nadia into his room and spoke to her without Saeed and said that he was entrusting her with his son's life, and she, whom he called daughter, must, like a daughter, not fail him, whom she called father, and she must see Saeed through to safety, and he hoped she would one day marry his son and be called mother by his grandchildren, but this was at to them to decide, and all he asked was that she remain by Saeed's side until Saeed was out of danger, and he asked her to promise this to him, and she said she would promise only is Saeed's father came with them, and he said again that he could not, but that they must go, he said it softly, like a prayer, and she sat there with him in silence and the minutes passed, and in the end she promised, and it was an easy promise to make because she had at the time no thoughts of leaving Saeed, but it also a difficult one because in making it she felt she was abandoning the old man, and even if he did not have his siblings and his cousins, and might now go live with them or have them come live with him, they could not protect him as Saeed and Nadia could, and so by making the promise he demanded she make she was in a sense killing him, that is the way of things, for when we migrate, we murder from our lives those we leave behind\".

I don\u2019t say such things liberally; it really did have a certain power due to it being so politically conscious, though somehow it failed to deliver what it could have done.Let us rewind a little. Exit West begins in an undisclosed east, in a city at war. The corrupt government is subsequently toppled and the new regime isn\u2019t exactly any better. The ordinary citizens, those with no particular political ties, are forced to do whatever they are told by whoever happens to be in power. Post-revolutionaries don\u2019t exactly make life any better. Enter Nadia and Saeed. They fall in love in the chaos that is approaching. The real world matters are pushed aside as they deal with the only real matter in their lives. They ignore the gunfire and the explosions and simply live for each other. Everything else is inconsequential until their lives become drastically threatened. Their freedom is a risk and as such they long for escape; they wish to leave the east and, as the title suggests, exit west. They leave much behind them in their bid for freedom though they know that, ultimately, it is worth it because they have each other. And here\u2019s where the novel goes shooting down the toilet at light speed. The only thing that would save it for me is a drastic re-writing of the last one hundred pages. As soon as the lovers exited west, all power the story had was wasted because of the mundane nature of what they then faced. I needed drama and I needed angry people and contentious political comment. Instead I got nothing. And this is where the novel\u2019s potential was missed. What began as a political allegory ended as a petty domestic dispute. It would have been far more effective if when Nadia and Saeed finally exited west, they were met with all the issues surrounding immigration and refugees. I wanted to see hostility and fear in the eyes of the westerners, I wanted to Moshin Hamid tackle one of the most politically sensitive issues of our age. Had he written such a thing, from the perspective of the refugee, I think it would have been an exceedingly timely piece of writing. It fell apart. Nadia and Saeed focus on matters of survival as the narrative goes absolutely nowhere. They shift from place to place as no progress is made within the writing other than the slow degrading of their relationship. For me, it all felt like one terribly large wasted opportunity. The author could have done so much more here. And to quote the author to illustrate my point: \u201cWhen we migrate, we murder from our lives those we leave behind.\u201dWhen the characters migrated, Hamid murdered the potential of this novel leaving it behind in the dust.

Nadia, the heroine, covers herself in black veils but as a defence against predatory or bigoted males rather than as an expression of religious or cultural conviction. Living spaces in this novel are depicted as temporary, transient, replacable. Even national identity is largely a series of acquisitions and adaptations, rather than some ineradicable essence of our being. National identity when articulated in language is so often just bigotry. I remember during Brexit the Brits who spouted off about national identity were individuals who made me feel ashamed of my country. If that\u2019s what being British is you can lump it. What even is national identity? To my mind about 80% of it is simply speaking the language of the country you live in, the simple ability to communicate \u2013 which is why tourism might easily be seen as a more lethal contributor to cultural homogeneity than immigration: ask any Venetian. I\u2019ve lived half of my life in Italy; Italians tell me I\u2019m more Italian than British. But this isn\u2019t true. I haven\u2019t had to change much about myself to live in Italy. I go to a bar for breakfast; I gesture more with my hands than I did in England. But it\u2019s wholly irrelevant that I\u2019m not catholic for example. To fit in I\u2019ve barely had to change anything about myself. So if there is such a thing as national identity and it\u2019s linked to cultural identity \u2013 both essentially dubious notions in my view otherwise why would I find myself relating much more to a Somalian jewellery designer than the neighbours of my parents? \u2013 you could say the true enemy is not the immigrant but the tourist, who rarely learns the language of the visited country. Hamid is saying we're all, in the context of history, migrants, just as we're all tourists. There\u2019s a distinction between Hamid\u2019s two central characters, Nadia and Saeed: she is open to change, he, more the tourist in mindset, far less so. The magical device Hamid uses in this novel might on the one hand been seen as the digital ease with which we can now move about the planet but can also be seen as a metaphor for the travel agency in all its modern myriad forms, including people smuggling. There\u2019s a nice little aside from a Native American in California towards the end of this book which brings home how absurd many of our concepts of national identity are. It\u2019s probably invalid to criticise an author for not doing something he had no intention of doing but I\u2019m going to do it anyway. Hamid is so caught up with presenting a big picture that he often seems to neglect his characters. Sometimes they\u2019re unable to articulate his ideas so he introduces a fleeting character of convenience who can. It was like the ideas of this book left his two central characters behind. At times it can seem more like some kind of brilliantly imagined essay than a novel. Perhaps that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. I\u2019m all for extending the boundaries of what a novel can achieve. But his virtual indifference to developing character began to make this novel seem like the literary equivalent of an air-conditioned environment for me. There was no weather. There was one particular moment when I most strongly felt this. The two refugees are in London and face racism and xenophobic nationalism in the form of a rioting crowd. The entire scene is depicted as if through a wide angle lens. It\u2019s impersonal in nature. I couldn\u2019t help feeling it would have been much more powerful and emotionally engaging had the author shown these two refugees being racially insulted close up by a small group of individuals and wondering why he didn\u2019t do this. Racism at its most emotionally disturbing for me is when I see footage of one or more individuals insult another individual face to face. When the hate and hurt caused are of a highly personal nature. That\u2019s when empathy for the victim is at its most powerful. And as a result of the impersonal nature of the hostility it seemed to have little effect on the character of the characters. They just drifted off to the next location with barely a metaphorical scratch. As the novel progressed the camera angle got wider and wider until I could barely make them out anymore. The ideas utterly dwarfed them. It felt more and more like this novel was written as a warning and the central thesis felt like a corset the characters were forced to wear which prevented them from developing as characters. They ended up little more than shadow shapes flitting over the globe \u2013 on the one hand brilliantly indicative of a universal modern truth but on the other frustrating from the point of view of my need to relate to the characters I read about. Exit West is a tough one to star rate. Probably the most straightforward way to rate a novel is simply by how much you enjoyed reading it. If someone hated reading The Waves or War and Peace then why shouldn\u2019t she give it one star irrespective of how much literary merit it might have? But sometimes we\u2019re able to admire what we feel little love for, like the eloquence of a politician all of whose convictions we disagree with. Not that I disagreed with Hamid\u2019s convictions but I can\u2019t really say I loved this novel as a novel, though it was hugely thought provoking and extremely relevant to the times we live in."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "People are on the move in Hamid\u2019s latest book, south to north and east to west. This strange little novel definitely has the feel of a season of sense8, the Netflix Original production about shifts in consciousness, space, and time. Hamid\u2019s characters, Nadia and Saeed, experience the bending of time and place, as when they leave their own war-torn country on the Asian subcontinent, a \u201cpassage both like dying and like being born.\u201dHamid\u2019s female character Nadia, who insists on being draped in a black cloak, or abaya, is more risk-taking and forward-thinking than Saeed. Nadia, not religious, wears the abaya to deflect attention, and it works, usually. Sometimes she does draw the anger or ire of men, when she is riding a powerful motorcycle or working in a store, but she doesn't back down, staring at the men steadily, aware and awake but not showing fear. Perceptions of the abaya change in the course of the novel. Once a means of conformity and of escaping notice, in the west and in the future the abaya becomes a statement of nonconformity and defiance. Nadia likes this gesture even better.Saeed, on the other hand, is good, kind, compassionate, nonviolent: he does not enjoy a tangle and avoids rather than confronts. He\u2019d learned to pray from his father, much as one is taught to think critically or handle difficulty. Praying became \u201ca lament, a consolation\u2026a hope\u201d that steadied and centered him. Throughout the novel these alternate approaches to life gently grate on the two young lovers who had not decided to spend their lives together until they found they had no option. The genuine love they feel for one another feels like displacement, since the families of each are lost.The refugee life, landing on Mykonos and somehow being smuggled to London, is hazy in process, but not in content. The danger, the hunger, the uncertainty, the resistance from light-skinned natives\u2026these feel some years in the future, despite our current history, because electricity is becoming scarce, and times are harsh. Time in this novel is intentionally fluid and hard to reckon. One day when Nadia sees on her phone a woman in a black abaya reading something on her phone, \u201cshe wondered how this could be, how she could both read this news and be this news.\u201d Time was bending around her: she might be from the past reading about the future or she might be from the future reading about the past. She might be two Nadias\u2026going in different directions.Hamid also dislocates the reader in space, in one paragraph describing Nadia and Saeed in London and in the next describing a family in Mexico, just miles from the Pacific on the U.S. border, facing a paradoxically dry environment so close to water. No explanation is given for this wild shift west, as far west as one can get before entering again the east.What happens in the novel is that time moves away from us. Hamid imagines our future, folding time and location. Remember Ruth Ozeki\u2019s A Tale for the Time Being in which time is folded? Ozeki makes a statement about physics, love, and life on earth, and I think Hamid might be pointing to this also. His characters love one another, but the stresses of their needs wear them out. They find sometimes that it is just easier to try to slide through the cracks alone, though sometimes one wouldn\u2019t survive alone. Think electrons. Think quantum theory.The lifetime Hamid describes in this novel feels like it could be now and also a long time in the future: a Muslim country torn apart, population movement via smugglers, a Greek island, Europe. But interspersed we are also getting news from Japan, South America, Northern Africa. Something big has happened. The policies of control at first are harsh and then loosen, so we suspect a big event. Borders are no more and groups of people try to decide the best way to govern, to protect, to provide.In one of the narrative shifts, Hamid points to a woman of advanced years and Asian descent living in Palo Alto. The woman lives in the same house she\u2019d lived in since childhood, the house having passed to her from her parents. She\u2019d been married more than once, had children, all while living in the house and yet now she felt distant from her neighborhood. Everything had changed around her while she stayed still. She was a migrant, too, Hamid suggests, because time had made her own insular unchanging world anachronistic. \"We are all migrants through time.\"This was a difficult book to understand through listening. I had the Penguin Random House production read by the author (thank you PRH Audio). Hamid read the book as though it were poetry, with stylized stops and breaths and some distance from the material. At times I felt totally involved, understanding it cognitively, but his sudden shifts to different parts of the world seemed intentionally dislocating. The final quarter of the novel really threw me. I listened to it five or more times and within a few sentences my mind was wandering each time. There must be something in there that sends me off, not computing. I downloaded a print copy (Thank you Riverhead & Edelweiss). This work is a good candidate for Audible's Whispersync option.This novel breaks new ground for Hamid. You are going to find yourself mulling his meaning as you examine our recent past, live through our near term, and contemplate our future."}, {"userName": "Iris P", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2641948-iris-p", "userReview": "Exit West\nMohsin Hamid - The AuthorWe are all migrants through timeMoshin Hamid - Exit West***********************************************Literature fulfills many roles in our lives. We read to learn about a certain topic, to develop a deeper sense of empathy, in search of enlightenment or just as a pure source of escapism. In Exit West, author Mohsin Hamid pursues a highly idealistic but worthy goal, namely, to give us a story that regards our planet's geography, its borders, and resources in a different way.Exit West is a wonder of a novel. Hamid stunning writing flows elegantly and beautifully and, in spite of its obvious political undercurrents, this is not an overtly political story. Instead, the author strives to take a more universal, existential and ultimately hopeful view on the issue of the refugee crisis and how the global community is reacting to it. There is also a romance here but this is far from a conventional love story. We first encounter Nadia and Saeed in their mid-20s, just as they meet while attending a business workshop. As it tends to happen when people are attracted to each other, they are in many ways, complete opposites. Whereas Saeed is a conformist who still lives with his parents and subscribes to most conventional norms and traditions, Nadia thrives in challenging them. She is non-religious, drives a motorcycle and is sexually adventurous. The country and city where they live remain nameless, but we learn from the start that this is a place on the brink of political and social upheaval. A civil war between the government and local Islamic militants is all but imminent.\n\n\n\nSyrian refugees at a camp in Bulgaria\n\nStill, Hamid emphasizes how, even in the midst of chaos and facing perilous circumstances, people strive to live ordinary lives. And so they work, they study, they pray, they fall in love. Or, as he puts it \n\"Our eternally impending ending does not put a stop to our transient beginning and middles until the instant when it does.\"\n We humans are nothing if not resilient.Eventually, the militants succeed in taking control of the city, forcing many, including Saeed and Nadia, to flee the country. It is here that Hamid inserts a rather unconventional literary device: mysterious \u201cdoors\u201d, which can be used as portals to travel from country to country, begin to appear everywhere, effectively allowing people to become instant immigrants.When I first heard the author describing these \"magical\" doors, the idea sounded so farfetched that I wondered if it might get in the way of the story. Fortunately, my concerns were misplaced as Hamid threads this concept so flawlessly into the narrative that shortly you just absorb it. This is not I think, by accident but by design, the physics and mechanical details of how these doors are supposed to work is not what he wants the reader to focus on. Saeed and Nadia's decision to leave underscores, once again, their contrasting personalities, Saeed dreads leaving his family behind and is weary of what lies ahead. Nadia on the other hand, is driven by what she might find behind those doors and the opportunities that might be awaiting them on the other side. The novel's first chapters are devoted to the \"leaving\" part of the immigrant experience. Hamid explores the agonizing process people go through once they decide to leave their country of origin as well as the many concerns they have to live with: Will I survive the journey? Will I ever see my country and family again? How soon will I adapt to this new place? Will I feel welcomed?\n\nSyrian refugees arrive on Lesbos, Greece\nThe next part of Exit West which covers the \"arrival\" part of the journey, follows Nadia and Saeed's life as refugees. Their travels will take them initially to the Greek Island of Mykonos, later on to London, and finally to Marin County, California. As time passes, the young couple remains protective of each other but they gradually fall out of love. By the end what has kept them together is mostly a sense of loyalty and a fear of losing their only connection to the past.Exit West has been marketed under the \"Magical Realism\" genre. For readers that might not find this description particularly enticing, I would say that this label applies only in the narrowest sense. Hamid's half-hearted embrace of some fantastical elements seems mostly design to underscore the parts of the narrative he wishes to keep in the forefront. To wit, the long-term patterns of human migration throughout history, the physical and emotional plight refugees endured every day and, for good or bad, the ubiquitous presence of technology in their lives.Unlike the characters in this work of fiction, real life refugees don't have access to magic doors to escape their predicament. Exit West offers a sensible, often nuanced interpretation of what it means to be displaced, of the distribution of our planet's limited resources and, in these times of Brexit and Trump, ask us to consider, what if we were to try another approach to the current refugee crisis?Rarely do I feel compelled to re-read a novel the moment after I finish it, but that was my exact reaction to this poignant story. A highly recommended read."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56035852-katie", "userReview": "I read this with very high expectations because of all the hype. I ended up wondering if a lot of the praise it\u2019s received has more to do with its subject matter than its quality as a novel.Its subject matter is the plight of refugees \u2013 without question one of the most potentially moving and pertinent stories offered by the world we live in. But this novel was oddly unmoving for the most part, due to the somewhat anaemic and dispassionate nature of its two central characters. Saeed and Nadia both begin the novel as fascinating characters. We\u2019re not told where they live though we can\u2019t help thinking Syria. Nadia rides a motorbike, has disowned her family, lives alone in her own apartment and yet wears a black gown \u2013 as a kind of protective disguise rather than a symbol of any religious belief. You could therefore say she\u2019s already a long way down the path to being \u201cwesternised\u201d. Saeed is more grounded in tradition. It\u2019s as if Hamid wants to give us two characters who don\u2019t radically differ from us in the West, characters we can easily identify with. But to do this he ends up making them a bit bland. When they fall in love Nadia is willing to have sex, Saeed isn\u2019t. Then the militants arrive. The most undocumented, harrowing and dangerous part of a refugee\u2019s life is absent from this novel\u2013 the journey from besieged homeland to the west. We don\u2019t see the escape from the militant strangehold, the boat trip or the detention centre on Europe\u2019s shores \u2013 in other words all the parts of the perilous and demeaning experience that are most likely to make a deep and changing impression on an individual\u2019s character. And not only do we not see them we don\u2019t feel the characters have experienced them, so unchanged do they remain. They make the transition from the horrors of a war torn country to \u201csanctuary\u201d in the West with barely a hair on their head ruffled. Hamid uses a device called magic doors to get his characters from one place to another. (Virginia Woolf once complained about the necessity of getting a character from A to B as a woeful limitation of the novel\u2019s form but I\u2019m not sure what she had in mind as an alternative was the device Hamid uses.) Is this device clever or is it a failure of imagination? I\u2019m afraid I\u2019d opt for the latter. The narrative adheres to images we\u2019re familiar with; it excludes the ones we\u2019re not. Because the main problem I had with this novel is that Saeed and Nadia don\u2019t really develop as characters throughout the novel, they never became vivid and living to me, their plight never moved me. They remained strangely neutered. They were too relentlessly rational in a world that was insanely irrational. They were like people experiencing the horrors on social media rather than on their nerves and skin. London gets a very raw deal in this novel. It\u2019s depicted as a place where natavists \u2013 xenophobic nationalists \u2013 are on the warpath in large numbers. Hamid\u2019s idea of London has far more in common with Donald Trump\u2019s notions about it than any reality I recognise. London voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and the Labour party recently annihilated the Tories in virtually every borough. If there\u2019s one place in Europe which has a welcoming attitude towards migrants London could hold itself up as a candidate. Perhaps it doesn\u2019t matter very much because this is a novel that gingerly remains one step removed from the real world. But if the city of Saeed and Nadia\u2019s birth is never mentioned why single London out? Probably I\u2019ve concentrated exclusively on what didn\u2019t work for me so I should say that I think Hamid is a very good writer \u2013 there are lots of excellent passages. I enjoyed the film of another of his novels. But this left me virtually unmoved which I can\u2019t help seeing as a failure given the unchartered, volatile and heartbreaking potential of its subject matter."}, {"userName": "Sam", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59357213-sam", "userReview": "For when we migrate, we murder from our lives those we leave behind. \nThough a thin slip of a novel, Exit West packs a powerful punch cloaked subtly in a quiet but dynamic tale of migration, told in exquisite yet plain language that is thought provoking and soothing and enraging and just plain beautiful. Nadia and Saeed of a unnamed nation are the focal points, and we follow their journey through young love in a country on the precipice of civil war, to unsteady allies as unwanted refugees in lands reasserting their nativeness and excluding the foreign and alien, to adults grappling with their changing selves and connections to each other and their home while building a new, uncertain future. But Mohsin Hamid makes this story so universal, drawing in smaller and larger patterns of human migration, of love and loss, and the ephemeral nature of humanity that makes one life and all life so precious and so precarious. I would give this 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5 stars for the depth of feeling and intelligence and beauty in the writing.\nFor one moment, we are pottering about our errands as usual and the next we are dying, and our eternally impending ending does not put a stop to our transient beginnings and middles until the instant that it does. \nHamid presents the constant churn of connection versus alienation, of new possibilities versus bittersweet nostalgia, of the cages we build for ourselves that we yearn to transcend versus the freedom we long for but also fear, of the comfort and joy of love versus how that love turns to loss and heartbreak: these all apply to our particular lives, and Nadia and Saeed\u2019s tale for certain, but also to the essence of what it means to be human. \nWe are all migrants through time\n is the quote most often cited by previous reviewers, and as the universality builds, I better understood why that jumps out so readily. He shows us a variety of characters, in Nadia and Saeed\u2019s tale and in the small anecdotes of individuals spread across the world, then illustrates the common threads uniting them (and us) all, and I loved this way of showing sameness by route of difference. His description of Saeed praying is very illustrative of his overall skill:  When he prayed he touched his parents, who could not otherwise be touched, and he touched a feeling that we are all children who lose our parents, all of us, every man and woman and boy and girl, and we too will be lost by those who come after us and love us, and this loss unites humanity, unites every human being, the temporary nature of our being-ness, and our shared sorrow, the heartache we each carry and yet too often refuse to acknowledge in one another, and out of this Saeed felt it might be possible in the face of death, to believe in humanity\u2019s potential for building a better world\u2026 Hamid does allow his characters to become as important as his larger ideas and themes, and I followed with trepidation the acquaintance, affection, alienation and estrangement of Nadia and Saeed as they encounter sectarian war, death, hunger, fear, refugee camps, the anger and kindness of strangers on their journey of migration. Hamid has a light touch of magical realism, as his characters escape via doors from one location to another, not letting their journeys in each location be compromised by too many details of the journeys between each location. Hamid is good at showing connection, a hint of a spark, how love begins in the early meetings between Saeed and Nadia, but he is even better at channeling the complicated feelings of a love grown stale and not nurtured as best it could be, a love being buffeted about by circumstance, and how humans fall out of love with each other as well, and simultaneously hold onto their connections and are dissatisfied with them out of \n\u201c\u2026the fear of severing their tie, the end of the world they had built together, a world of shared experiences in which no one else would share, and a shared intimate language that was unique to them, and a sense that what they might break was special and likely irreplaceable.\u201d\n I won\u2019t speak too much more on the plot details and where Nadia and Saeed end up physically or romantically, but most of the world\u2019s greatest love stories, whether ending for good or ill, together or apart, involve adversity and strife and trials of the highest order, and Nadia and Saeed\u2019s certainly fits that criteria, even if their union doesn\u2019t immediately vault to say Romeo and Juliet immortality. But Hamid makes the love story as compelling as the larger ideas about humanity, which of course is also the point: in our own little lives, we may feel as though we love someone greater than any person has ever loved someone, and when our hearts are broken, we feel devastation and despair so great that no one else could have ever had their heart broken so badly before. But the human experience is a shared experience, and we can (and should, and probably don\u2019t do enough) empathize with each other and rebuild ourselves and our world on the backs of that shared empathy. \n \u2026the apocalypse appeared to have arrived and yet it was not apocalyptic, which is to say that while the changes were jarring they were not the end, and life went on, and people found things to do and ways to be and people to be with, and plausible desirable futures began to emerge, unimaginable previously, but not unimaginable now, and the result was something not unlike relief. \nThis novel is incredibly timely in the wake of Brexit, the Trump election, the horrors of the war in Syria, the plight of refugees in Europe and the deepening of the various fault lines between people, whether by religion or color or orientation. But it\u2019s also timeless, looking at the vast history and fabric of human experience, and ultimately in Exit West and in human life, hope springs eternal, time moves inexorably forward, all things must end and what comes after always can be better than what came before. And in addition to those universal themes, the particular tale of Nadia and Saeed is both a great framework to explore these complex, intertwined ideas, and a beautiful yet bittersweet story of love and loss between two individuals. I was incredibly moved by this read, which I devoured over the course of a few hours, and throughout I found myself constantly marking pages, writing down specific lines and passages, and feeling overcome with emotion. Very much recommend for lovers of literary fiction, who like a quiet but powerful story, and like to be able to step outside of one\u2019s usual box at the same time as being reminded of our greater commonalities than differences as a human race.-received an ARC via edelweiss, thanks to Riverhead Books and Penguin Random House."}, {"userName": "Adam Dalva", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3263980-adam-dalva", "userReview": "I really loved this book, and can say without hyperbole that it accomplishes one of - or in my opinion, THE - main goal of fiction: it generates empathy that allows us to better understand our world. The story here is a close allegory of the contemporary migrant experience, and the clever use of a surrealist device (I won't spoil it) and the close 3rd realism with which the two leads are drawn makes a deep, lasting impact. The surreal/real mix is echoed in Hamid's clever mingling of classicism and the contemporary - EXIT WEST is a firm rebuke to those who argue that novels can't incorporate modern technology without feeling overly experimental. Phones and the internet replace letters and nostalgia, and in that replacement they show that it's possible to achieve strong feelings through our devices. The violence is a contradiction too; it's both brutal and largely occurs passively, off-screen, a rumor with glimpses of horror at the periphery (a soccer game, a bloody ceiling). Best of all, this is a love story, and a good one. You find yourself caring for both Nadia and Saeed, veering between indignation for one and the other, with the great callbacks and setups that make real-life relationships feel plotted. The best, most difficult love stories necessitate rooting for the individuals even more than the coupling, and Hamid pulls it off.I did feel the book could be a touch longer, and in its desire to make itself universal, it perhaps suffers a touch from its non-specifics. This is not a criticism, exactly, but it's a clear choice by Hamid to name and map the Western world while consigning Nadia and Saeed to Anytown, and I sometimes felt the frustration of that vagueness. On the other hand, to leave leaders and politics totally out of it and only show the effect of their decisions felt exactly right. And we don't miss the scene lesser writers might have given us in which a scientist leans back in his chair and gives a hazily realistic explanation for the surreality. We are happy not to have it.A late twist with Nadia, on the other hand (you'll know the one), felt a bit out of nowhere and could have used one more beat of set-up to make it feel earned. I'm not complaining about the plot-point, exactly, but the novel's sparseness makes certain second-half maneuvers feel schematic in comparison to the rich world of the beginning.I won't spoil the ending, but it works too. Almost all of this does. I sense that, as so often happens, an ocean of political hype might soon drown out the literary achievement here.

In beautiful prose, Hamid weaves a personal affecting account of being a refugee with providing a social and political commentary on war, and the deplorable experiences that refugees are subject to in various countries in the west. It begins in the East, a country that to me feels like it could be Pakistan, where the independent and adventurous Nadia meets the more introvert and timid Saeed just as the country begins to slide into a horrific civil war that comes to tragically encroach on them personally. As the violence escalates, leaving their homeland appears to be their only option, the two hear of rumours of the existence of doors, portals that allow them to exit West, an inherently fantastical element that they, amongst so many others, utilise. Narrated by a dispassionate observer, this is a story of war, identity, adapting, love, loss, sacrifice, and what it is to be a traumatised refugee amidst the hostility that swamps them in the countries in which they harbour elusive hopes of safety and security.The couple go through numerous doors which includes visits to London and San Francisco in California where a large tent city has grown. What Nadia and Saeed encounter in their travels has them questioning who they are and what they mean to each other, exacerbated by the toll that the stresses and strains of their situation place on them. This tugs at the threads of their love and their personal relationship as it begins to fray. Nadia's responses differ from Saeed, she is more adaptable than he is as he sinks into prayers in his search for answers. As the challenges and demands of being in exile, immersed in a world that looks unfavourably on them, it is barely surprising that their love for each other begins to fall apart, although their regard and affection for each other remains, built through the fires of their mutual history.This is an immensely thought provoking novel, confronting the growing nightmare of anti-refugee sentiments that engulf the west, amidst the ever growing exodus from war torn, dangerous and unstable nations. Refugees face bigotry, racism, riots, death and more. Mohsin Hamid's novel speaks to us of the times we live in and the uncertain and unsettling future beckoning greater worries of greater turbulence. My one regret is that the emotional distance provided by the narrator deprives the story of a more emotional and visceral reality that readers may have connected with more.

When I read that scene, I immediately thought, yes, looking through a telescope is a perfect metaphor to use in a book that sets out to examine the plight of people whom the majority of the book\u2019s readers may not otherwise see close up.  If I picked up on that minor scene, it was because I'd been thinking about telescopes in relation to another book about exile I'd been reading, Us & Them, which, like a metaphorical telescope, seemed to bring the far-away near, to make \u2018them\u2019 indistinguishable from \u2018us\u2019.As I read more of Exit West, I was certain I would find similar magnifying power but before long it seemed to me that Hamid\u2019s metaphorical telescope served a different function, almost an opposite one. In the scene in which the real telescope is mentioned, the main character is using it to look at Mars, the second-nearest planet, its features indistinct, the colour of a sunset after a dust storm. The story then moves on and the telescope and Mars are forgotten in the press of events. I would have forgotten them too except that the more of Hamid\u2019s story I read, the more I felt I was viewing it from far away rather than close up. The characters became distant and unknowable, the locations alien and unrecognizable, the pace of the story, odd, speeded up at times, dragging at others.

And spoke, the lower half of her face obscured by her cup.\u201cSo men don\u2019t fuck with me,\u201d she said.\u201dReading her response was a surge of power.I continued on excitedly and became quickly invested in the narrative and the smooth switching point of views. I especially enjoyed how the story shifts from focusing on Saeed and Nadia to introducing swift tales of other character perspectives while stepping through a door that can whisk them far away from their homeland.\u00a0The language in those stories was in particular eye-catching. And I cherished how it gave us a broader look on a vital topic such as migration.But circling back to the main pair in this book, I was fascinated to follow the relationship and journey\u00a0quiet and devout Saeed and fiercely independent Nadia undertook\u00a0through their shifting positions in life after the imminent fall of their city. From students to lovers to migrants to survivors, and so much more... It was powerful and refreshing\u00a0to witness.And this quietly beautiful moment stands out most when I think of them:\u201cHer leg and arm touched Saeed\u2019s leg and arm, and he was warm through his clothing, and he sat in a way that suggested exhaustion. But he also managed a tired smile, which was encouraging, and when she opened her fist to reveal what was inside, as she had once before done on her rooftop a brief lifetime ago, and he saw the weed, he started to laugh, almost soundlessly, a gentle rumble, and he said, his voice uncoiling like a slow, languid exhalation of marijuana-scented smoke, \u201cFantastic.\u201dSaeed rolled the joint for them both, Nadia barely containing her jubilation, and wanting to hug him but restraining herself. He lit it and they consumed it, lungs burning, and the first thing that struck her was that this weed was much stronger than the hash back home, and she was quite floored by its effects, and also well on her way to becoming a little paranoid, and finding it difficult to speak.For a while they sat in silence, the temperature dropping outside. Saeed fetched a blanket and they bundled it around themselves. And then, not looking at each other, they started to laugh, and Nadia laughed until she cried.\u201dI was moved and strengthened\u00a0by this passage.However, their relationship hit a bit of a lull about halfway through the book for me when it\u00a0was seemingly going nowhere in particular. And then also in terms of plot or character develemopent there wasn't anything exciting on the table. But once the book managed to move from that rough spot, I was all the more enraptured.All in all: Exit West was an impactful read about\u00a0war and migrants and nativists while also veering into themes of love, desire, and religion.\nNote: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

Ha. Anyway, back to the matter in a hand... With Exit West I think Mohsin Hamid does something quite spectacular. At the forefront this is a novel about the refugee crisis, and worlds turmoil, right now (when you read it you'll notice where the books different settings are) yet set in an alternate near now where people can escape through random doors which take them to other countries. It is also a stunning tale of a relationship between Nadia and Saeed who meet in a land on the brink of war in their younger years. I'll say no more other than read it."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788446-hannah", "userReview": "This was beautiful, stunning, memorable, and really special; an anti-war and pro-tolerance piece with a human heart. Mohsin Hamid never loses sight of the important factors of his story: his characters and their interactions; he doesn't stray from the emotional heart of this story to make a point; and he writes with a precision and beauty that is absolutely breath-taking. This is Nadia's and Saeed's story; from their first meeting in an unnamed muslim country on the brink of civil war, to their subsequent journey to places that are hopefully safer. These two form and their ill-timed relationship are the core of this novel. Mohsin Hamid uses his brilliant premise (what if there were suddenly doors all over the world leading to other places?) to explore the emotional impact of being a refugee instead of the logistical impact. He can ignore the hardships of travelling over land to other countries that are safer, to focus instead of the intimate experience of being foreign - of being a stranger in a strange land without having wanted to be that. I adored this. I thought this focus worked really well and made this story something really special.He has a unique way of structuring his sentences that I found beyond brilliant. He made me reread sentences and reread passages. This is where this book truly shines: It is unbelievably beautifully written and breathtakingly structured. His command of his story-telling voice is beyond impressive. While I thought his characters were vividly painted and their relationship believable and heartbreaking, they are not what I will keep remembering. But I think that is ok - because while their story humanizes the book, it is both universal and personal in a way that kind of renders the characters irrelevant in the broader scope of the work.First sentence: \"In a city swollen by refugees but still mostly at peace, or at least not yet openly at war, a young man met a young woman in a classroom and did not speak with her.\""}, {"userName": "PorshaJo", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5464046-porshajo", "userReview": "I'm a firm believer that an audio book can either make or break a book. It could be just a meh book and the narration can be so wonderful it catapults the book to the tops of lists. Then, there is the other side. And this is where that book falls for me.I was so looking forward to this one and grabbed the audio. Sorry, but I will just say it was not for me. The narrator, the author himself, spoke in very short, halting sentences. I have no idea if that is how the print was or not (oh I hope it was not). I could not concentrate. Any other book, I would have shut it off immediately. But I kept pushing as I really wanted to like this one (forced reading never ends up a favorite of anyones) and I'm going to hear the author speak about this book later this year. But in the end, I found the story line boring. It seemed all over the place and I didn't understand, or care, about the doors. Again, chalking this one up to the audio.I'm going right down the middle with my rating. I am going to give the print version a shot after I hear the author speak. Perhaps without the frustration of the audio, the print will flow better for me. I've seen so many wonderful reviews on this one and how wonderful the prose was.

That's what I felt about this book, the potential was limitless.. the sky was the limit for this novel, yet it felt short... It's political It's sad It's a post Brexit world There are doors and gaps and different countries and two people in love Saeed and Nadia ... the two heroes. From the East going to the West. The language is beautiful and fluid, romantic with not much dialogue which sucked to be honest. The male character was very different from the female and the female who was assertive and independent in the past, just vanished slowly and become less independent and more average .

It's about freedom, connection, struggle and discovery. And it just hit home for me.I was engaged from the beginning when I was first introduced to the heroes of the book, Nadia and Saeed. The magic of the doors and the speculation they provide took it further and made me ponder without feeling like I was being compelled to pick sides or consider a specific view. What would happen if thousands of migrants from various countries suddenly appeared in various other countries all over the globe, crossing borders with little possibility of resistance? How would the rest of the world react? How would the migrants proceed? How would it change the face of the world moving forward? The doors themselves don't need to be explained as anything more than metaphor and as devices to make the transport possible, that's not the point. In this story it doesn't matter as much how it happened as it does that it happened and what happens next?The characterizations made me sympathize without feeling like the characters were written specifically to elicit sympathy. The choice to tell the story through the experiences of only two people, effectively denying anyone else substance, is an indulgent one, and one that I'm sure is frustrating to a lot of readers. To me, it demonstrates Hamid's understanding of human nature. The connection between pious Saeed and prickly Nadia in the face of such unstable circumstances is beautiful but unidealized- optimistic but tenuous. There are obvious political inferences if you look for them, but I'll leave everyone else to interpret them how they will because they didn't affect my reading experience one way or the other. If nothing else, I'll say this novel humanizes immigration in both positive and negative ways, which I think is important regardless of your feelings on the subject.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library"}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma", "userReview": "An intriguing and penetrating look at the overlap between familiar and extraordinary. Or that's what it was for me, sitting pretty in my white middle class, safe, Western life. The point being that for too many people around the world, violence and war are far from unknown. My reading of the book saw an emphasis on the striking dichotomy between the apparent normality of two young people meeting, going on dates, and falling in love, with the brutal, sudden invasion of death.  For Nadia this person was her cousin, a man of considerable determination and intellect, who even when he was young had never cared much for play, who seemed to laugh only rarely, who had won medals in school and decided to become a doctor, who had successfully emigrated abroad, who returned once a year to visit his parents, and who, along with eighty-five others, was blown by a truck bomb to bits, literally to bits, the largest of which, in Nadia's cousin's case, were a head and two-thirds of an arm. Not only is the above sentence a perfect example of that savage negating of life, it highlights the method by which Hamid uses to emphasise it. Often, his sentences are short, matter of fact. This person did this. Then they did this. He illuminates the every day. One little thing, one personal choice, one small decision after another. Then he fits in these long, perfectly created sentences with absolute precision. He suckers you in with the list of seemingly innocent, even irrelevant details and then hits you hard with stomach turning violence. It mirrors, as much as any literature can, the way in which war often arrives in the lives of ordinary people, without warning or mercy. The whole narrative is full of complexity, constantly fighting hard against stereotype and the obvious, without losing the quality and beauty of its style. The picture of life within chaos would have been magical even without the special doors that offer the chance of escape. Definitely a book for our time.ARC via Netgalley"}], "description": "In a country teetering on the brink of civil war, two young people meet\u2014sensual, fiercely independent Nadia and gentle, restrained Saeed.
