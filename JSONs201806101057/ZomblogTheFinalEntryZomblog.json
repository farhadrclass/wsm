This was my least favorite book in the series and not just because the main character, Meredith, was getting on my nerves. She was quite selfish and childish in the second book as well, but the story held my attention in spite of her. However in this book she goes beyond selfish and childish and moves right into sociopathic behavior. I don't care how much gore you've seen rational people will feel something when someone that has been their companion dies. The author tries to make her such a bad-ass that it really just gets unrealistic and annoying. Then we must address the issue of rape, which is prevalent in the first two books as well. I realise that our society is full of nasty sick people, but I think in order to be a rapist or child molester/killer you have to be a friggin psycho scumbag to begin with. I do not think that a zombie outbreak would cause half of the men left living to start raping everything that moved. At one point in our story a man has a blade run through him and is bleeding to death, but still manages to spend his last ounce of strength to rape our dear Meredith. REALLY?!? The over whelming need to find food, shelter, basic human contact, medicine, fend off zombies, etc, but raping seems to be the favorite past time of half the men left. Hey, fellas don't feel left out, at one point you get butt raped too. I mean, my gawd, even the Vikings took a day off!!I like T.W Browns writing style and I will be reading the Dead series, but I do think this book went way off in the \"raping ditch\" and unfortunatly will cause some readers to be very turned off to his other books."}, {"userName": "Ariana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18395359-ariana", "userReview": "I want to give this book a 4 star rating, but I really can\u2019t quite do it. When I first finished this book, I was disappointed, but after some reflection I decided there actually were meaning and reason under all the devastation. I like the world itself in regards to survivor interactions and retaliations as well as the general outlook of human existence. I enjoyed liking and disliking the main character, the latter more often towards the end of the book. Some things were vague, \u201cMaybe they will see my note\u201d but doesn\u2019t explain what the note says, and other unclear details of small things. There are context clues, but sometimes it\u2019s a stretch. Every so often, the writing would get sloppy, there is this one character that seems to be forgotten for several chapters, only to be brought back and ended. Also, while the main character is a woman, the book is very clearly written by a man. There are just certain little things she (he) says that are unrealistic (even given the zombie apocalypse). I would also say that it ended slightly suddenly, almost pushed to hit a deadline, but again, after a moment I appreciated the ending. I will read the (4th) book in the series, but probably nothing else from this author. Also, not that it affected my rating, but I read the eBook version of this, and the story ended at 82%, with the rest being excerpts for the authors other works. It\u2019s a personal pet peeve of mine, but honestly, I\u2019d like to know when I\u2019m in the ending chapter instead of thinking I still had close to 20% of story to go. Just a smidge of courtesy would be appreciated."}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "I do hope this is NOT the final entry as so want to know what happens in this ZPOC world....I cried twice, once when a well loved character died and then at the end for two reasons, it WAS the end and also the actual ending.... and this was a horror novel!Meredith is my new hero this girl has super sized (very pink & non hairy) b*alls.... a new world adventurer.... certainly with fear as she often piddles her pants, probably so would I faced with the horrors she comes across.She makes some tough decisions and has some sad, but negative, insight into herself, which along with her story telling makes up the way this novel is written.TW Brown manages to stay within the confines of the diary style exceptionally well, I felt like I was reading history but along for the ride.I want to find out what happens to Snoe... so please write more!"}, {"userName": "Nicole Storey", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6157333-nicole-storey", "userReview": "This is the final book in TW Brown\u2019s Zomblog series. I must say that I loved every book in this trilogy! My only worry was that after reading the first two, the last book would leave me with questions and no answers. I should have known that Brown wouldn\u2019t let me down! After all, he is one of my favorite authors!In the last book, we follow Meredith on her quest to reach Las Vegas. I stated in my review of the second book, which you can read here: http://nicolestorey.wordpress.com/201... that I had a love/hate relationship with this character. That did not change in the last installment. Meredith is still selfish. To an extent, she only cares about herself. As a matter of fact, she seemed to become immune to the death of her so-called friends, simply brushing it off when someone died \u2013 even when their death was at her expense or caused by her own stupidity. I can\u2019t say that I was saddened by the ending, but I still admired her courage and determination.Brown did an excellent job with this entire series. He created a mixture of characters who made me laugh, cheer, love them or hate them. The surprises and action were never-ending and I can\u2019t count how many times he threw in a twist that left me breathless! These books have every element that makes a good story memorable. My mind was still in the stories long after I finished reading. I feel sorry for those who have not read TW Brown. They are missing out on an extraordinary author!"}, {"userName": "Craig", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6508739-craig", "userReview": "Quite easily the worst of story in the series. The main character became a hypocrite when she would complain about others judging her when she has been judging others throughout the three stories. I also became annoyed when she would complain that the world had devolved into humans fighting each other again when all along she has been actively attacking various groups of humans whom she did not agree with. The worst part is when I finally read how the main character died, I felt nothing. No anger. No joy. I did feel a bit of relief though. I was glad the story was over and I could safely stop reading. I also cannot tell you how many times I rolled my eyes while reading this story. The author compounded the problem of a horrible main character with multitudes of editing errors. Perhaps they existed in the first two books too, but I felt there were way too many added words and words that just didn't make sense in the context. One glaring error was the word 'wonder' instead of 'wander'. He also had points where he had double prepositions, as if he could not decide which way to word the sentence. I also found myself enraged when the author said that one of the characters \"could care less\" when he really meant that they 'couldn't care less' .I will definitely not be reading any more of this author's books. I cannot recommend them to anyone else either."}, {"userName": "Brandon Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12048519-brandon-kelly", "userReview": "I picked up the series while writing my own book and deliberately chose a genre and a voice that would not confuse my process. I thoroughly enjoyed Zomblog and was thrilled that there were subsequent books. The Final Entry, however, really got under my skin. I felt that the main character, Meredith, was so well portrayed and thought out that there was really nowhere else for her to go. Yes (without giving away the plot) she had her plan, but no doubt inevitably the end result would have been the same. I know someone like her, they just simply cannot sit still, they do not have quiet minds. So, alas, the final entry was just that, but I will say that I was really upset because this character to me was so clear and powerful that she could have evolved and perhaps carried another two books or at the very least a movie."}, {"userName": "RJ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4187755-rj", "userReview": "The journal continues with Meredith as the author. Meredith and Eric continue their journey across country, but I forget why or where they're going. I'm sure it will be made known to me again soon. Evidently the Native Americans have taken over Wyoming as their own; they even constructed a fence of sorts. Go figure. It's an interesting narrative; I've read better, but I've read worse too. Ah yes, I remember now; Las Vegas, that's where she is heading. Evidently Meredith is beginning to wonder why also; and on top of that, why is Eric keeping her company? All good questions.

Meredith remains true to her convictions, right to the bitter end, and even though things didn't turn out as I'd hoped, I still admired her character and her guts and determination to really live in a world full of death. Bonus points to T.W. Brown for writing a truly believable female character and writing her so well.

Meredith continues to be an interesting character - important when you are reading what is in her head. I like the elements of introspection amongst the simple reporting of events.Again, the biggest horrors come from those who have the choice of inflicting pain or not, on others. Again, humans and their lack of humanity is a major player in Meredith's journey both actual and within."}, {"userName": "Kels", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5407419-kels", "userReview": "there were quite a few grammar & spelling errors in this one as opposed to the first two. noticeable; but didn't take away from the story.Meredith IS selfish...but can you blame her? she lived her life on her terms.the ending actually made me say \"aww\" out loud. wasn't expecting it but it's the apocalypse, what do you expect?"}, {"userName": "Selinalynn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4330920-selinalynn", "userReview": "I can't express how much I liked this series.
