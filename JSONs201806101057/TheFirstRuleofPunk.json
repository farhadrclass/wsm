(Can\u2019t believe I need reminding\u2014aah, university, what are you doing to me!?) When the principal tells her the punk makeup she's wearing is not welcome in the school, she finds new ways of showing her style.Whenever someone tells her she can't do something, she tries twice as hard, instead of giving up. She reminded me of... me! I used to be seriously scared of getting into trouble at school and then not get my diploma, or worse, end up in jail! Pouuufff, I've ruined my life. Malu is a little bit like that too. Although she believes in punk behavior and doing what she believes is right despite possible consequences, part of her still wants to avoid getting into trouble and disappointing figures of authority. Some have shelved this book under ''graphic novel''. It is NOT a graphic novel. It does, however, contain a lot of zines (short free magazines created on a specific topic), so there is visual art. But this is not at all a visual story. It's one hundred percent a novel, just with awesome zines that give more punk to the novel. I needed to clarify that, because Goodreads shelves have deceived me more than once in the past. There is also much talk of Mexican culture in this book, as the heroine herself is half Mexican and has a love-hate relationship with the Spanish language, even though she now goes to a middle school with a majority of Spanish-speaking kids. Will she ever feel like she belongs?Pssst! It\u2019s pretty remarkable that 100% of people liked this book on Goodreads, but not surprising, as it is a compelling read.

They\u2019ll tell you about all the cool children\u2019s books you\u2019ll get to read. They\u2019ll stress how you\u2019ll be able to make a difference in the lives of kids by introducing them to books they might never find on their own. They\u2019ll talk about the glory of the profession, and rightly so. But they won\u2019t tell you about Middle Grade Novel Burnout. It\u2019s a killer, that one. You see, if you read too many middle grade novels in a given year, you begin to sense patterns that no one else can see. In 2017 I\u2019ve started down that path. I\u2019ll give you an example of a particular pattern: The new kid in school. It\u2019s not a new idea for a book (Joseph Campbell would probably tell you that it\u2019s just a variation on the old \u201cA Stranger Comes to Town\u201d storytelling motif) but this year it's gotten extreme. In book after book authors have hit the same notes. Kid is new. Kid is awkward in the lunchroom (seriously \u2013 if I never read another lunch room scene again it\u2019ll be too soon). Kid makes friends with outcasts. Kid triumphs by being true to his or her own self. Simple, right? They blend together after a while, but it\u2019s not the fault of the format. A good book, a really good book, transcends its format. Much of what I\u2019ve read this year has already faded into a fuzzy haze in my brain. You know what hasn\u2019t faded? The First Rule of Punk by Celia C. Perez. A riotous, raucous conglomeration of Zine art, Mexican-American punk rock, and a nicely flawed protagonist with enough verve and oomph to keep those pages turning, I\u2019m happy to say this book distinguishes itself from the pack. Even if there is the occasional lunchroom scene or two.When your mom is SuperMexican life is tough. And when SuperMexican announces that you are moving with her for two years from Gainesville, Florida to Chicago, Illinois, away from your beloved father and friends, you\u2019re allowed to get peeved. The trouble is that Malu doesn\u2019t think she has ANYTHING in common with her mom. Malu doesn\u2019t like cilantro, loves punk music, makes Zines, and has absolutely no interest in connecting with her Mexican roots, so to speak. Still, Chicago isn\u2019t quite what she expected. And when the chance comes up to put together her own ragtag punk band, she finds that sometimes you follow the rules, sometimes you break the rules, and sometimes it\u2019s a lot more fun to just go on out and make your own rules. First and foremost, Ms. Perez makes sure right from the start that kids reading this book will find it fun. That's why right after the very first chapter we get our first glimpse at Malu's Zines. Now I've seen novels like this work in doodles and line art all the time. But wrack my brain though I might, I cannot remember a single time that I've ever seen Zines as a way of breaking up the text. It's seems so obvious, but it would only really work if it was consistent with the main character's personality. Check and check on that front. Ms. Perez isn't interested in weighing you down with some almighty tome. There's fun to be had in them thar pages, and she's going to show you that right from the get-go.Adults reading this book definitely will have a different take on a lot of the scenes, character, and elements than a kid would. Perfect Example A: Malu\u2019s dad. One of Malu\u2019s more prominent flaws is her complete and utter blind adoration of her father. To her, the guy could do no wrong. He\u2019s cool (owns a record store, introduces his daughter to punk rock, plays music, etc.) so therefore he\u2019s the perfect parent, right? Kids will undoubtedly be inclined to agree with Malu on this point. Wouldn\u2019t you rather stay with: your rocker dad or your uptight uncool mom? But to any adult reading this book Malu\u2019s dad has warning signs written all over him. Put another way, the dude\u2019s a loser. Not a total loser. He\u2019s a good dad, insofar as it goes. But when it comes to being a practical parent who could support his kid solo for months at a time, don\u2019t rely on him. Malu\u2019s mom (who, from the way she puts up with the kid\u2019s attitude, verges on having the patience of a saint) knows this full well. So does he, for that matter. It\u2019s just Malu and the kids reading this book who may be unaware of the situation in full. One thing that kids won\u2019t remain ignorant of are the moments when Ms. Perez slips in some old-fashioned learning. Now she has an Ace up her sleeve in at least one respect. The Zine format allows her to work in pretty much anything she wants, just so long as it has art and good design. Hence we\u2019re able to hear about \u201cPunk Senorita\u201d Marianne Elliott-Said and not feel like we\u2019ve been handed a history lesson. This could all have backfired, however, if the story itself had had an abundance of history cluttering up the pages. Instead, it's woven in subtly. As an example, one of the highlights of the book for me is when Malu discovers that in Chicago there has been a strong punk Mexican American scene. Actual bands are name dropped like The Zeroes, Alice Bag, the Plugz, and the Brat. One does wonder why Malu\u2019s dad didn\u2019t bother to seek out any of this information for his daughter himself, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.I was discussing this book with another reader the other day when they mentioned that they found Malu\u2019s attitude towards her change in life, venue, and situation \u201ctoo young\u201d for her age. At the time I had to process that comment for myself. Malu is a middle school kid, just hovering at the cusp of adolescence. Honestly, when I sat down and thought about it, I actually found her attitude to be a bit mature for her age. She\u2019s doing full on teenage tantrums much younger than you\u2019d usually expect. Is she immature? Completely! But she\u2019s immature in a self-absorbed, narcissistic way. You know. Teen-age stuff! Malu is so complete wrapped up in her own head that she does come close to distancing the reader emotionally several times. You want your heroine to be headstrong but not stupid. To speak her mind but not be too much of a jerk. Kids will give their protagonist a lot of leeway when it comes to parental units, but you can only lead them in that direction so far, so it\u2019s up to the author to know exactly where to draw the line. Ms. Perez does a pretty good job in that department. You sympathize with Malu, but you\u2019re also allowed to disagree with some of her choices. Trust me when I say that a protagonist that\u2019s always right is a pretty dull person to read about. Other middle grade novels will prove that much to you.I wouldn\u2019t call it a perfect novel. The propensity of grown-ups to break rules for Malu happens repeatedly and is most unbelievable when a fellow parent is in on the conspiracy. The principal that promises fire and destruction in the event of an alternative Fiesta doesn\u2019t seem too miffed later. And a mom apologizing for freaking out when her daughter dyed her hair green? That\u2019s where it totally lost me. Sorry, kids. Moms will be freaking out moms. But at its best The First Rule of Punk is like a Mexican-American High Fidelity meets School of Rock for kids. A game plan for taking expectations and giving them a personal twist. And hey, any book that inspires kids to make their own Zines is a-okay with me. For ages 10 and up."}, {"userName": "Brett Zeeb", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65608986-brett-zeeb", "userReview": "I was lucky to read an advanced reader copy of this book.

I really liked a lot of things about Mal\u00fa from the beginning, because it was completely relatable to me to see her struggling with her identity. She doesn\u2019t want to be the perfect Mexican se\u00f1orita her mother wants her to be, but instead wants to be punk like her dad.Mal\u00fa\u2019s struggles really highlight the unrealistic expectations that are placed upon children of color. Mal\u00fa is called a \u201ccoco\u201d (brown on the outside, white on the inside), by her classmate Selena, the perfect example of a Mexican child. Unlike Selena, Mal\u00fa doesn\u2019t speak Spanish perfectly, she doesn\u2019t like cilantro, doesn\u2019t enjoy traditional Mexican dancing; basically doesn\u2019t do things that are \u201cexpected\u201d from a Mexican child. But does this make Mal\u00fa any less Mexican?Of course, there\u2019s more to the story than this. This book isn\u2019t only about identity and culture, but about friendship and finding your place. We see Mal\u00fa\u2019s character develop throughout the story while she makes new friends and meets more Mexican people and role models who help her understand her struggles.\n\nI like to think of us as more like patchwork quilts. Some pieces are prettier than others. Some pieces match and some don't. But if you remove a square, you're just left with an incomplete quilt, and who wants that? All our pieces are equally important if they make us whole. Even the weird ones.\n\nI think that this book really shows how representation is important, as we see how much Mal\u00fa starts to reevaluate her life once she meets more people who are actually like her and she sees all the possibilities of what she can be.In between chapters, we see excerpts of zines Mal\u00fa makes, which gives us extra insight into who she is and what she admires. I liked this aspect of the book a lot because it was a fun little surprise waiting for you at some parts of the story.While being middle grade, this book never feels to me like it\u2019s too \u201cjuvenile\u201d or \u201cchildish\u201d;\u00a0yes, the main character is 12 years old, but the story is written in such a way that it\u2019s difficult not to get sucked in. Mal\u00fa\u2019s narrative voice is honest and a little bit sarcastic, which made a lot of situations both relatable and completely hilarious. I definitely recommend this book to anyone, because it\u2019s fun and refreshing while also dealing with serious issues such as culture and being yourself.

P\u00e9rez is a touching story about punk loving Maria Luisa, who likes to be referred to as Malu. When she and her mother move to a new town and Malu starts a new middle school, she keeps reminding herself of the first rule of punk: be yourself. Unfortunately, Posada Middle School makes that hard to do with rules about dress code and an anti-punk principal. Readers will enjoy Malu\u2019s wry sense of humor and relate to themes like fitting in and being new. The book has black and white illustrations and collages throughout, which add to the charm.

Malu and her father love punk rock music, and her mother is not a fan, so Malu really wishes she could stay with her father. Even though she makes an impassioned plea in an artfully crafted zine, she is living in Chicago before she knows it. It's a fun, quirky neighborhood with lots of other Hispanic residents, which delights Malu's mother but doesn't break through Malu's irritation. On the first day of school, she wears heavy eyeliner despite her mother's objections, and gets sent to the auditorium for a dress code violation talk. There, she meets a boy who has dyed his hair blue (but dresses like Henry Huggins!) who ends up being the son of the local coffee shop owner, Ms. Hildago, and the grandson of her neighbor. Malu's school career doesn't go well, since she has run afoul of the popular Selena, so when a school talent show is announced, she gathers a few people to form a band (the CoCos, after Selena's slur that she is a \"coconut\"). When they don't make the cut during auditions because they are too loud and not traditional enough to honor the school's namesake Jose Posada, Malu decides to embrace the rules of punk and have an alternative concert. The band, and Malu, continue to have rocky times, but ultimately are able to be appreciated for being true to themselves. Strengths: It's nice to see a middle grade character with specific interests, and one who takes initiative to change circumstances she doesn't like. Stories about moving are always popular with my readers, and I thought it was interesting that Malu moved to a neighborhood that seemed like a better fit for her, even though she didn't want to recognize it. The zines between the chapters are interesting, the various characters well drawn and unique, and the celebration of Hispanic culture is more in depth than in many books I have read. Weaknesses: I had a different concept of zines in my head-- Malu's work seemed more like scrap booking to me, but the author is well know for her own zines. Also, Malu's love of punk culture doesn't seem to be doing her any favors, and I found myself identifying more with her mother! (Go wash that gunk off your eyes, young lady, and put on a clean shirt!)What I really think: I will definitely buy a copy.

The First Rule of Punk though BLEW me away. I was thinking about all of my past students and even future students who will relate to this in more ways than just the protagonists storyline. This is a book I will immediately preorder multiple copies of. Mal\u00fa is a young girl who feels that who she is doesn't meet her moms expectations (every girl age 12&up) solely because she is half Mexican/half white, and because of that her mom is constantly on her about learning her heritage and wanting to be proud that their family came from Mexico to America and the hardships they went through to get here. Her Dad on the other hand is this punk rock, record store owning, creative soul who Mal\u00fa finds herself clinging to. Then her world crashes upside down when her and her mom have to move to Chicago for a couple of years for her moms career. Mal\u00fa finds herself unsure she will ever make friends, especially after a few run ins with Selena, who isn't exactly the nice girl to the \"weirdos\" slash \"coconuts\" as she calls them. Mal\u00fa goes through a lot of typical new student challenges, and in the process she realizes that being herself is exactly who she needs to be, even though it may not be a direct reflection of her Mom, she does understand that her Mom has good points and she needs to meet her halfway with learning her culture and appreciating where her family came from. This is an amazing story that encompasses how so many of my students whose families that come from Mexico have discussed with me. They don't know about their culture and what things mean, nor do they speak Spanish, and Celia does an absolutely AMAZING job of weaving in historical points throughout the text that are a lot of Mexican traditions or sayings that get misconstrued by the public.

The First Rule of Punk has heart, humor, spunk, and charm. And, of course, a radical and delightful punk-rock sensibility in the main character, Mal\u00fa. This is a terrific story about a girl, Mal\u00fa, who has to move from Miami to Chicago with her professor mom for two years, and is bummed, and wants to be punk rock about it (her dad, back in Miami, owns a record store) but finds it's hard to maintain a punk rock attitude all the time, especially when you're only 12 and in a new town. She is also a zine maker and the book includes her zines as she makes them, which is so cool to see, and will no doubt inspire zine-making in readers (I read an advance copy of this book, and am very much looking forward to the \"real\" book, when the zine art is all final).I'll be honest: this book is so ridiculously my type of book that I was unspeakably giddy the whole time I was reading it. If you are a fan of spunky main characters who are finding their way and find their people despite (or because of) their parents' influences, arts/crafts/zines/glue sticks, Chuck Taylors, tights, musical references, coffee references, delicious food references, and Beverly Cleary references, then you will also love this book."}], "description": "From debut author and longtime zine-maker Celia C. Perez, The First Rule of Punk is a wry and heartfelt exploration of friendship, finding your place, and learning to rock out like no one's watching. There are no shortcuts to surviving your first day at a new school--you can't fix it with duct tape like you would your Chuck Taylors. On Day One, twelve-year-old Malu (Maria Luisa, if you want to annoy her) inadvertently upsets Posada Middle School's queen bee, violates the school's dress code with her punk rock look, and disappoints her college-professor mom in the process. Her dad, who now lives a thousand miles away, says things will get better as long as she remembers the first rule of punk: be yourself. The real Malu loves rock music, skateboarding, zines, and Soyrizo (hold the cilantro, please). And when she assembles a group of like-minded misfits at school and starts a band, Malu finally begins to feel at home. She'll do anything to preserve this, which includes standing up to an anti-punk school administration to fight for her right to express herself! Black and white illustrations and collage art throughout make The First Rule of Punk a perfect pick for fans of books like Roller Girl and online magazines like Rookie.", "title": "The First Rule of Punk", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32050089-the-first-rule-of-punk", "average": 4.11, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1497633275l/32050089.jpg", "reviews": 405, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9838714.Celia_C_P_rez", "name": "Celia C.
