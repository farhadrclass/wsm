It\u2019s a relatively early novel of Fontane\u2019s, considering his late start as a novelist (it was published in 1888, when he was almost 70), but I think it\u2019s a minor melancholy masterpiece, almost up there with his great Effi Briest. The German title of this novel is Irrungen, Wirrungen\u2014Confusions, Delusions, as a previous English translation renders it. I like that far more than the more portentous On Tangled Paths, which is the title of the Penguin Classics edition in which I read it. Irony seems to me key to Fontane\u2019s art, and the sense that human experience can be simultaneously tragic and banal.Fontane is at his most minimalist here (if I can generalize on the strength of having read only three of his novels so far). There are no dramatic events of the type we find in Effi Briest or Irretrievable, and Fontane deliberately underplays what little action there is. The arc of the narrative is familiar and predictable to the point of clich\u00e9: a love affair between a lower-class girl and an impecunious young aristocrat, preordained to end in tears. Everything falls out pretty much as almost every character in the novel has been predicting from the first pages, but that doesn\u2019t weaken the novel in the least. The feelings of both protagonists are explored in a characteristically sensitive, mobile, oblique, slightly understated manner. It\u2019s there that the interest of the novel resides.The sense of place is very strong in this novel, as in the other two novels of Fontane I have read. Lene\u2019s childhood home on the outskirts of Berlin, where many of the early scenes take place, is an evocatively rendered location, as is the local holiday resort Hankel\u2019s Stowage (Hankels Ablage), where she and her lover Botho slope off for a poignant failed tryst. I also liked Botho\u2019s meandering cab ride to the cemetery at Rixdorf to lay a wreath on Lene\u2019s mother\u2019s grave: the kind of completely inconsequential and yet strangely emotionally charged episode at which Fontane excels. There\u2019s an elegiac feel to the topography of the novel, as well as to its sentimental texture. The first sentence, describes the market garden near Lene\u2019s house, as having \u201cstill\u201d been there in the mid-1870s, when the fictional narrative begins, as if it seems extraordinary, only a decade later, that such a thing could ever have existed so near to the center of Berlin."}, {"userName": "Cat {Wild Night In}", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5284431-cat-wild-night-in", "userReview": "First published in 1887, Irrungen, Wirrungen tells the story of two lovers who are doomed to never spend their lives together despite wanting to.Although the theme was hardly a new one, even to contemporary readers, the way the story unfolds is beautiful- Fontane has a knack of leading the reader by the hand, showing and not telling the depths of the main characters\u2019 feelings for one another.Lene, the main female character says from the start that her relationship with Baron Botho cannot last. Instead of the couple fighting against tradition and society\u2019s expectations, the pair of them whole-heartedly embrace said expectations. Later in the novel, a friend of Botho says that he is going to defy convention and marry the penniless love of his life. Botho replies that if he goes ahead with a marriage, it will bring misery to both of them in the long run as it goes against the status quo."}, {"userName": "Julia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9424947-julia", "userReview": "Eine Novelle, die den Realismus bedingungslos repr\u00e4sentiert.

There is one marked difference between his novels and that of his French and English counterparts, though \u2013 Fontane\u2019s novels lack any trace of the sensational novel and of melodrama that run so strongly through the work of the other two. There never is much in the way of plot, and even if characters die through suicide or in duels, there is never really any sense of drama to it \u2013 even tragic events appear business as usual, pieces of miscellaneous news on the last page of the morning paper whose perusal hardly raises an eyebrow. Depending on the reader\u2019s bias, the resulting novels have been called true to life, poetic, or plain boring, but for the most part, Fontane is considered on of the most important German language writers of the late 19th century.Irrungen, Wirrungen fits quite well into this (the common English translation of this title as \u201cTrials and Tribulations\u201d is quite far off the mark, by the way, \u201dDelusions, Confusions\u201d is much closer to the German original, while \u201cEntanglements\u201d follows the spirit even as it strays from the letter). The novel, one of Fontane\u2019s earlier ones, does not have an antagonist, does not even really have any conflict \u2013 it is about a pair of lovers separated by class, petit bourgeois Lene and aristocratic Botho who spend some time together but then go on to marry someone more appropriate to their social status. In the end, everyone just agrees to do the reasonable thing, and while they might bear some regrets both of the novel\u2019s protagonists see societal conventions as something that cannot be circumvented or rebelled against but only submitted to. Even the reader is left behind wondering if this outcome isn\u2019t the best for everyone concerned after all.I used to intensely dislike Fontane; after struggling through two of his novels (struggling to stay awake, mostly), I filed him under \u201cterminally boring\u201d and gave up on him. It was somewhat to my surprise, then, that I not only felt the sudden urge to re-read something by Fontane but also found myself actually enjoying it \u2013 I suppose this is an indication that I\u2019m getting old.The plot of Irrungen, Wirrungen, such as it is, is almost reminiscent of Henry James, with class barriers playing the part of the gap between the Old and the New World, but the authorial temperaments of Fontane and James could hardly be more different. Where James constructs a hyper-subtle, extremely close third person point of view, Fontane\u2019s narrator is omniscient and his tone genial and conversational \u2013 the German word \u201cgem\u00fctlich\u201d nails it quite precisely, evoking some kindly old grandfather figure sitting by the fireplace wrapped in a blanket and with his feet up telling stories from his life and times. But as it turns out, that congeniality is not really to be trusted \u2013 it masks just how relentless and without hope of escape a grip social conventions have on the novel\u2019s protagonists. As one of the novel\u2019s minor figures, Frau D\u00f6rr, puts it (in an entirely different context but the image seems clearly intended as an emblem for Prussian society in the late 19th century), \u201cIt\u2019s a swamp that just pretends to be a meadow.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Czarny Pies", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29160274-czarny-pies", "userReview": "\u201cTrials and Tribulations\u201d is about achieving happiness in late nineteenth century Prussia by following society\u2019s rules. Young men can sow their wild oats with women of inferior social station but when the time comes in their lives to enter into respectable marriages they must promptly end any inappropriate liaison. Young women from lower social classes should respect the rules that govern the lives of any lovers they might have from higher social classes and not make a fuss when they are inevitably dropped.When our hero Baron Botha realizes that his financial difficulties have left him with no other alternative but to enter into an advantageous marriage, he rapidly terminates his affair with Lena a seamstress: He says to Lena: \u201cOrder is a great thing and sometimes it is worth everything. And now I must ask myself, has my life been \u2018orderly\u2019? No. Order means marriage. \u2026 Yes my dear Lena, you too believe in work and orderly living, and you will understand and not make it hard for me.\u201dTotally nonplussed, Lena our heroine assures him that she will not any fuss saying: \u201cI am not like the country girl who ran and threw herself into the well because her sweetheart has abandoned her.\u201d Botha is of course immensely relieved. He does later reflect that he might have fled to the new world with Lena and started afresh. However, doing so would have required more effort than our hero would have been willing to make: \u201cI cannot leave the service (i.e. my military career) at twenty-seven years of age to become a cowboy in Texas or a waiter on a Mississippi steamer.\u201dLena fortunately finds a nice young man from the appropriate social class who is anxious to marry her even after she informs him of her fling with the Baron. The Baron is similarly fortunate as his wife chooses to gently smile at his earlier dalliances. I find it difficult to admire any of the characters in this well-crafted novel but I must acknowledge that it probably describes very accurately the reality of a certain era."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45382102-sara", "userReview": "my teachers version of the electric chair"}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2619724-barbara", "userReview": "Beautifully written story, set in Berlin in the late 1800s, about a poor seamstress and a young baron who fall in love.

Lene embodies all of Botho's ideals of nature, truth, simplicity while Kaethe represents the opposite: artifice, superficiality, elegance. But Botho abandons his ideals in favor of order and social acceptance. He has second thoughts, but in the end burns his carefully preserved letters from Lene - Kaethe catches him but instead of being furious with retrospective jealousy, as he had feared, she understands her victory and participates gleefully in the 'auto da fe'. The next day, she happens on a wedding announcement in the newspaper: Lene has married the older, eccentric Gideon Franke. Kaethe, as befits both her class and personality, reacts not to the matter itself (unsuspecting of its pertinence to her) but to the superficial: she laughs at the ridiculous (\"komisch\") names of the newly-weds, Gideon and Niempsche.

Autore tedesco d\u2019origine francese, conservatore e allo stesso tempo impietoso critico della Prussia imperiale di fine ottocento, della borghesia dei nuovi ricchi, dell\u2019arrivismo e dell\u2019opportunismo, si affaccia alla carriera letteraria esordendo all\u2019et\u00e0 di sessant\u2019anni con L\u2019adultera, primo di una serie di romanzi che avranno come protagoniste (anche nel titolo) donne, tratteggiate e giudicate con grande umanit\u00e0, sensibilit\u00e0, affetto e profondit\u00e0.Irrungen Wirrungen \u00e8 una delle prime opere di Fontane e usc\u00ec sulla rivista Vossische Zeitung nel 1887, e sin dall\u2019inizio incontr\u00f2 un dissenso da parte della critica e del pubblico.Il titolo originale non ha equivalenti nella nostra lingua, e bench\u00e9 sia stato pubblicato diverse volte in Italia, ogni volta \u00e8 stato tradotto con titoli diversi.Il libro, ambientato a Berlino tra il 1875 e il 1878, racconta la storia d\u2019amore tra la stiratrice Lena Nimptsch (appartenente alla classe borghese) e il barone Botho von Rien\u00e4cker, ufficiale dell\u2019esercito prussiano. I due si conoscono il luned\u00ec di Pasqua durante un giro in barca nel parco della citt\u00e0, gita in cui la giovane Lena rimane quasi vittima di un incidente e il barone Botho interviene per salvarla. Tra i due nasce un\u2019amicizia che, durante il corso delle settimane successive, ben presto si trasforma in amore. I due intrattengono una relazione pura e allo stesso tempo appassionata. Botho frequenta la casa della giovane, una piccola casetta vicino allo zoo della citt\u00e0, e simpatizza con la madre adottiva di Lena, la signora Nimptsch e la famiglia D\u00f6rr, vicini di casa di madre e figlia.Sin dall\u2019inizio, Lena sa in cuor suo che la relazione con il barone non potr\u00e0 andare avanti a causa della differente classe sociale cui i due appartengono; un giorno, infatti, Botho riceve la lettera di uno zio, in quei giorni di passaggio a Berlino, che lo vuole incontrare. Durante l\u2019incontro, lo zio gli ricorda il precedente impegno di sposare la giovane e ricca cugina K\u00e4therina von Sellenthin, il cui immenso patrimonio dar\u00e0 la possibilit\u00e0 alla famiglia di Botho di poter ripagare un prestito che altrimenti sarebbe impossibile da rimborsare a causa della precaria situazione finanziaria familiare.Prima di potere decidere il suo futuro, Botho propone una gita fuori citt\u00e0 a Lena, durante la quale si paleser\u00e0 l\u2019impossibilit\u00e0 di continuare la loro relazione e i due amanti dovranno rassegnarsi, malgrado non lo vogliano, a vivere l\u2019uno lontano dall\u2019altra.Ogni volta che leggo un libro di Fontane il suo stile mi piace sempre di pi\u00f9. \u00c8 stato bello leggere un suo romanzo dopo un bel po\u2019 di tempo dall\u2019ultima volta; penso proprio che non lascer\u00f2 passare troppo tempo prima di rituffarmi tra le pagine di un suo libro. Theodor Fontane \u00e8 un autore poco conosciuto in Italia, ma secondo il mio modesto parere meriterebbe una riscoperta.Errore e passione (questo il titolo in italiano di quest\u2019edizione) \u00e8 un breve romanzo, in cui non accade nulla di particolare, dove non ci sono colpi di scena o azione, sviluppi drammatici di grande intensit\u00e0 o descrizioni minuziosissime dei personaggi, ma vi \u00e8 una bellissimo affresco della societ\u00e0 berlinese e tedesca degli ultimi decenni del XIX secolo.Il libro ha al centro della narrazione la vicenda sentimentale di due giovani, nata per caso e vissuta nella consapevolezza della sua fine forzata, perch\u00e9 le convenzioni sociali renderanno impossibile la sua prosecuzione. La societ\u00e0 tedesca sotto il re Guglielmo I, infatti, impedisce qualsiasi unione tra due persone appartenenti a classi differenti, senza gettarli nel disprezzo e nel rifiuto della collettivit\u00e0. L\u2019autore, grazie ad una grande e acuta capacit\u00e0 d\u2019osservazione, quasi microscopica, ritrae la societ\u00e0 dell\u2019epoca con sottile ironia, disapprovando l\u2019ipocrisia e l\u2019attaccamento a valori e a codici ormai trapassati, senza perdonare nulla n\u00e9 alla piccola borghesia n\u00e9 alla nobilt\u00e0.Si dice che Fontane (considerato uno degli autori tedeschi pi\u00f9 importanti del XIX secolo) faccia dialogare i suoi personaggi, e malgrado abbia letto solo due opere, posso affermare che ci\u00f2 \u00e8 vero; ad esempio, anche in questo romanzo i dialoghi si svolgono in circoli ristretti nel corso dei quali i vari personaggi rivelano pensieri, atteggiamenti, interessi che ci permettono di conoscere a fondo le loro vicende e i loro caratteri. Fontane usa sapientemente diversi registri di linguaggio per dare quel ritratto dei personaggi che altrimenti non sono descritti fisicamente; infatti, conosciamo la protagonista Lena come una ragazza buona, sincera e un po\u2019 ingenua, coraggiosa e anticonformista, grazie a suoi pensieri e alle conversazioni nella vita quotidiana; Botho, invece, si presenta come un ragazzo gentile ma un po\u2019 spavaldo e, alla fine anche codardo. Nota di merito va ai discorsi logorroici ed autoritari che caratterizzano la signora D\u00f6rr, vicina di casa, matura e \u201cvissuta\u201d, della famiglia Nimptsch, che spesso fa da accompagnatrice alla giovane coppia durante le loro passeggiate nei dintorni.Bellissime, accattivanti ed evocative, quasi come un quadro o una vecchia fotografia, le descrizioni del paesaggio berlinese, sia interno sia esterno alla citt\u00e0. Un romanzo, Errore e passione, narrato molto bene e dal ritmo tranquillo, in cui spicca la grande penna di Fontane, la sua gran cultura e preparazione, il suo sguardo ironico e acuto nel raccontare una storia apparentemente semplice; in cui sono presenti implicazioni religiose, sociali e simboliche (basti pensare alla scelta dei nomi dei personaggi, presi con leggere alterazioni, da personaggi storici o letterari, oppure con significati sottintesi ed ironici), o citazioni di frasi e situazioni tratte da opere d\u2019altri autori. Un\u2019opera che strappa qualche sorriso ma, allo stesso tempo, fa riflettere su quanto le convenzioni sociali possano distruggere le vite e gli amori delle persone.Tutti i godimenti sono in fin dei conti immaginazioni, e chi ha pi\u00f9 fantasia gode di pi\u00f9. Solo l\u2019irreale costituisce il valore ed \u00e8, per cos\u00ec dire, l\u2019unica cosa irreale."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106263-eric", "userReview": "Unbelievably great. A doomed romance across class lines, a tale of cold decisions, of loss and regret, told simply & compellingly without any of the histrionics or maudlin conventions usually associated with such an enterprise. An early effort from Fontane, whose prose cuts right to the heart: perfectly balanced, clean, crisp, surgical. (Much credit due translator Peter James Bowman). The flavor of Berlin as a city in transition, both physically & spiritually, near the end of the 19th century is in the air & in the background, adding an extra element of authenticity to the landscape the characters wander thru, as well as a disquieting sense of foreboding. Fontane brings us into the worlds of both the working class and the moneyed military with equanimity & avoids any anxiety, bias, confrontation or sensationalism. Nevertheless, the story is a devastating one that presages the coming century in its clinical treatment of psychological issues, its realism & irony.

Due to their class-related circumstances, they find themselves against society in their wish to be together. I actually really liked this book. It is beautiful, and for an early novel is rather good. The story follows both Lene and Botho from the moment they meet until the end. Fontane is incredibly descriptive of his character's circumstances and emotions, and really paints a picture for the reader. Some of the book is quite hard to read, as Fontane has a habit of writing very long dialogues, but apart from that I found myself getting through it quite nicely.As this was a translated version, there was also an addition of footnotes, which were quite useful to me. I definitely found some of it hard to understand and so the footnotes put the background knowledge in for me. However, I am not from Germany and know nothing of their history, and so this was difficult for me; I am assuming the audience it was intended for originally would have understood this in much more detail, and so it wouldn't have been a problem.Although the story was short, I felt involved in the characters' lives, and found that the length actually really worked. I was hoping and hoping for an ending throughout and, although it wasn't necessarily the ending I had hoped for, I really did enjoy it, and it left me with this thought: 'If your brain and your heart are both heading towards different options, always go for your heart, because the lack of heart can never fully be replaced.'"}, {"userName": "Lara Mi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21924792-lara-mi", "userReview": "On Tangled Paths probably deserves a second chance.

This is supposed to be Fontane's masterpiece. It left me cold. As a love story with the classic conflict of class difference, I see the point, but I disliked Botho so severely, I could not help but cheer when he leaves Lene because he felt obliged to his family to marry for money and expectations rather than love. I do not see what she saw in him. She is a delightful woman - honest, independent, loving, devoted, selfless. He is everything modern man should find repulsive in the moneyed class - lazy, pompous, self-obsessed, and arrogant. How could anyone of anytime be reading this thinking that Lene would be happy with him? I am off to do some lit crit reading on this to see another perspective. Many it is the translation, maybe the era - regardless, not high on my list."}, {"userName": "Lydia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4903231-lydia", "userReview": "Prekvapivo dobr\u00e9!
