As you might expect with such a background, synchronicity, and supernatural events are nothing out of the ordinary. Within the first few pages you care about her people, their presence is so strong. A presence that still remains after death.Her book is packed with tales that will make you laugh and cry out loud... entertaining at the least, at most may make you rethink perception and life after death.I cried buckets in places, for her people, and my own... and reading her book left me with an overall feeling of comfort. That the family we love, are still out there watching over us.Jane Cranmer also has a Facebook page that I find very inspiring. Daily she turns the ups and downs of everyday life into positive messages."}, {"userName": "Fiona Mccrickard", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5492618-fiona-mccrickard", "userReview": "Really enjoyed this book. Written as the authors life unfolds and her experiences with the afterlife persist and she becomes more able to understand what she is seeing & being told by her ancestors & angels. Written in short sharp chapters at a good pace and I really got to know the characters in Janes family. A witty, sometimes sad, but a honest account of Janes life, I am looking forward to the next book."}, {"userName": "Mindy/fangedmom", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2391157-mindy-fangedmom", "userReview": "This book was TRULY amazing. I had goosebumps and chills through out the whole book. I cried and laughed. I feel like I know Jane and her whole family. I feel so close to them and love the connection she has and continues to have with her family. This is an INCREDIBLE story of what so many do not realize are around them at all times. Some are more lucky to experience it than others!I cannot wait until Jane writes another book to share her life and the life of her family with us!"}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5492519-suzanne", "userReview": "i loved this book from start to finnish. it was a very easy reading and kept me gripped to all hours. would recomend this book to any of my friends. think it is well worth the money xxxxx"}, {"userName": "Mitzi Gaunt", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6192751-mitzi-gaunt", "userReview": "Can't wait for the next one.This book is funny, heart wrenching and entertaining all in one."}, {"userName": "Michaela Smith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5330649-michaela-smith", "userReview": "Beautifully written book, that feels like a leisurely stroll through someone else's life.The people are warm and alive and I felt I got to know them , to the point I was saddened when they died, but that's the whole point of the book, to show that perhaps it's not the end ...more a change of venue and that 'goodbye' is more of a 'see you later'. Though I'm a sceptic regarding these matters , Jane's ethereal anecdotes are charming and entertaining and told in such a wonderful 'non preachy' way. Somehow I came away strangely comforted by her beliefs and wondering if maybe ..just maybe.......... ?This is a lovely easy going read, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "Carol J.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6230285-carol-j", "userReview": "A brilliant read about a lovely lady and her family."}, {"userName": "Raela", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57460016-raela", "userReview": "knowledgeable"}], "description": "A true story of one ordinary family's extraordinary experiences with the paranormal.
