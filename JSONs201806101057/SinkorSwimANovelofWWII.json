But before he leaves for boot camp, he and his brother Colton, 12, are out fishing one day when a German U-boot suddenly surfaces, injuring Danny and putting him in a coma.Angry at the Germans for what happened to his brother, and feeling like there is nothing he can do, Colton decides to take Danny's enlistment papers and take his brother's place in the Navy. Tall for his age, Colton doesn't really look 17, but the country was desperate for fighting men and didn't look that closely at him, although different people do question his age.Colton, now called Danny, gets through boot camp, and even manages to impress his company commander with his knowledge of knot tying. Along the way, Colton makes two good friends, Josef Straub, legally in the Navy, and Woody, a 15 year old who also lied about his age in order to enlist. After graduating from boot camp, he is sent to Miami for subchaser training along with Straub and Woody. Subchasing was the job he requested in order to pay the Germans back for what they did to the real Danny.The three friends are eventually deployed on a patrol craft, whose job is to escort convoys of merchant ships up and down the eastern seaboard, looking for U-boats and wolf packs (groups of submarines), and attacking them before they could attack the convoy. Later, Colton's patrol craft is assigned to escort a convoy in the North Atlantic during the Battle for the Atlantic. Conditions in the North Atlantic are terrible, mostly because of the freezing weather and rough seas, but eventually a wolf pack attacks, and Colton's ship is sunk. A handful of survivors find themselves in the North Atlantic in a lifeboat surrounded by sharks for a number of weeks. Finally, they are rescued along with some captured Germans, and Colton finds himself in a New York City hospital, recovering from a serious leg wound. And then his mother, who has had no idea where her son was or what he had done, shows up...Sink or Swim is definitely not a character driven story. It is, however, a real action-packed novel that gives detailed realistic descriptions about everything Colton experiences in the Navy. And while this may sound like the exciting Navy adventures of a 12 year-old, there is enough truth in Colton's story to show the other side of war - death, destruction, fighting, and the fact that the Germans they run into are just young teenage boys, too.I did think that Watkins did a great job of maintaining a certain innocence in Colton. He is, really, just a seventh grader when he joins up. Feeling a tinge of guilt that his mom doesn't know where he is and what he's doing, he dutifully sends home his pay each month, sans $1.00 for himself. Compare that to his friend Woody, who spends it as quickly as he gets it.Although this isn't a character driven novel, I did like the cast of characters that Watkins put Colton in touch with. Sometimes they could be a bit nasty to him until he proved himself, but for the most part they were a pretty nice bunch of men. It was refreshing to read about men who didn't need to feed their manly egos in war for a change. And I think that helps make this a much more appealing story for middle grade readers.Watkins includes a nice glossary of Navy terms and of different events, like the Battle for the Atlantic, that might not be familiar to all readers. He clearly did a good deal of research for Colton's story, and has woven in lots of historically accurate facts that make this book so interesting to read. And readers may be surprised to learn in the Author's Note that Colton's story is based on the true-life story of a boy named Calvin Graham. Watkins includes a number of books and articles he read while writing Sink or Swim, including two about Calvin. One of them, \"The Boy Who Became a World War II Veteran at 13 Years Old\" can be read online.Sink or Swim is an exciting story that should appeal to WWII buffs, history buffs, and the fast pacing makes it particularly appealing for reluctant readers.This book is recommended for readers age 9+This book was an ARC sent to me by the publisher, Scholastic Press"}, {"userName": "Cooper Deschamps", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70853433-cooper-deschamps", "userReview": "Sink or SwimSink or Swim is a very good book by Steve Watkins about WWII. First off there's a kid named Colton. he is an average person on a small island call ocracoke. He is a son of a fisherman who died a few years from the time in the book. When him and his brother, Danny, are out fishing, a german u-boat capsizes Danny\u2019s boat. Colton tries to save his brother and soon finds him out in the freezing water. Colton helps his brother into the boat. When Colton gets to shore, his mother rushes Danny to the hospital. Then Colton takes Danny\u2019s military papers and signs himself up for the military. Is he up for this challenge?I like this book because it is fun to read. I also like it because you don\u2019t want to stop reading it. One thing that I liked the most was that it has a lot of details in it but not to much. Another thing is that the main character is faced with these hard challenges and he struggles to get better. Also, I liked it when Colton showed the grown men how to tie these simple knots and everyone complained about having to do them. It was funny when at the end Danny and Colton were riding beach ponies and Danny named them Woody and Straub, some of Coltons friends in the navy.Last of all the book was fun and I liked it a lot. The book to me is about courage and the ability to do things that you are scared to do. There is also a little bit of sadness near the end but otherwise the book is happy."}, {"userName": "Drew E", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72152765-drew-e", "userReview": "The book Sink or Swim by Steve Watkins is so great that I want to read it 100 more times! The word choice in the book is not the highest level of words though. The strengths and weaknesses are that there is so much detail and it tells you a lot about one thing, but the book talks a lot about the not most important things. I would definitely recommend this book to my classmates because it is a really good/sad book and I bet a lot of kids want to read something based on a true story. If this book was in series I would by far happily read the other books in the series."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50734566-stephanie", "userReview": "This was a terrible book!

Certainly, I haven't encountered a story quite like this one, featuring a plucky twelve-year-old protagonist. After his older brother, Danny Graham, is injured by a Nazi U-boat while the two boys are fishing, Colton decides to take his brother's enlistment papers and join the navy. With Danny in a coma and their father having died years before, the family's economic situation is tenuous at best. Trusting to fate and the kindness of strangers and hoping that the officials will be too busy or too desperate to pay much heed to his youthfulness, Colton leaves the North Carolina coast behind. Boot camp is just as tough as Colton has heard it would be, but he makes friends there and proves his mettle. Eventually, he is assigned to a subchaser crew with his friends Woody and Straub. There's quite a lot of action, and Colton is hard to resist even though some of his escapades seem a bit exaggerated. Once his ship is destroyed and he is wounded, word is sent to his mother, and the gig is up for this brave but foolhardy young man. This account of a young sailor was inspired by the true story of another young man who was the youngest person to serve during the war. The author does a good job of capturing the innocence and thoughtlessness of Colton as well as his determination to make a difference through his service. There were some parts that strained my belief, though, including his brief encounter with Patrick Hemingway, the son of the great writer, in Key West, and the author's six-toed cats. While that certainly could have happened, it just made the story more unlikely, at least in my eyes. Still, this title will appeal to many intermediate readers who are intrigued by military service and submarines. Because everything doesn't work out the way Colton might have liked as his adventure and mission to kill those Nazis turns into tragedy for some of the crew and since he realizes that many of the Germans are just like him, fearful, hopeful, and capable of compassion as well as being mortal. This is much more than a wild adventure tale as it shows just how deep hatred and bigotry can go while also highlighting the best of humanity."}, {"userName": "Ms. Yingling", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2636606-ms-yingling", "userReview": "E ARC from Edelweiss Above the TreelineWhen Colton's brother Danny is injured by a U Boat while out fishing in the Outer Banks, Colton decides to take his brother's papers and go into the navy in his place. Their father is dead, and their mother can use the navy pay... even though Colton is only 12! When he does a good job teaching a number of the men how to tie nautical knots, he is offered a place on a patrol craft, scouting for U Boats. He is a hard worker, sends home all of his pay, and makes friends with Woody, a farm boy, as well as Straub, who watches out for him. He is assigned to help cargo ships get from New York City to Key West, and there are a few problems with U Boats. When things get quiet, it's because the German vessels have moved North, and the PC is assigned to help ships get to England. On one mission, Colton's boat is badly damaged. Men die, and a few are left to survive on a life boat. Colton is badly injured, so when he finally returns to the US, his mother is alerted and tells the navy his age. While this is a fictional work, an afterword says that it is based on the real life story of Calvin Graham. Strengths: This had everything I could want in a WWII novel. Sympathetic protagonist, slightly different outlook (PC with the navy), good period details (including a brief appearance by Ernest Hemingway's sons), lots of military action, and a predictable but very sad death, so that readers don't glamorize war. I am always suprised at how much I sometimes enjoy a WWII book, and it is definitely a popular topic with many of my readers. Weaknesses: Colton is almost too good to be true. He is a good seaman, sends home all of his pay except for a dollar here and there, and doesn't even get into trouble while on liberty. Great to see, but a little harder to believe when I see the impulse control of 13 year olds on a daily basis!What I really think: Excellent addition to the list of WWII fiction, and probably Watkins' best work."}, {"userName": "Mrs. Hornick", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69999668-mrs-hornick", "userReview": "Sink or Swim by Steve Watkins follows the story of a boy named Colton, Colton is a boy who is witnessing World War two and can do nothing about it.

He gets the assignment he wanted, patrolling the Atlantic looking for U boats. All parts of his service come to life-the physical hardships of basic training, the boredom, punctuated by heart stopping action, of life at sea. There's a moving death, and war in general is not glamorized. What I liked best about the book is that a the young men, and boys, that made up this crew weren't caricatures of manly toughness; they were allowed to cry, and have introspective moments, and be true friends.

I already knew about Hitler and his war, so coming into this book I thought i would learn more about that. Boy was I wrong you see a background of a boy who took his older brother\u2019s sign up form for the army. This book is like My Brother Sam is Dead, because the kid wants to help his land, his home, but is too headstrong against the British in this case Hitler. Colton is the youngest to serve in the army in WWII. In his mind he sounds like a hero in reality he is a hero that is only 12 years of age. He just needs to keep that a secret.

Danny has worked hard to provide for Colton and their mother ever since their father died. To bring in better income, Danny enlisted in the Navy soon after Pearl Harbor. But before Danny leaves for boot camp, he is seriously injured in a boating accident. With Danny in the hospital and their family desperately needing money, Colton takes Danny\u2019s enlistment papers and his identity. Sink or Swim is a gripping novel loosely based on the true story of Calvin Graham. Twelve-year-old Calvin ran away to join the Navy and was injured while serving in the South Pacific. Thinking Calvin was living with relatives, his mother saw a newsreel showing Calvin after he rescued several of his shipmates. She contacted the Navy and, at thirteen, Calvin was sent home but not before receiving a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart for bravery. It is very apparent that Watkins did extensive research to authentically showcase what many WWII sailors experienced during that time. On this bed of fruitful research, Watkins can spend quality time developing Colton\u2019s character and crafting a meaningful read.
