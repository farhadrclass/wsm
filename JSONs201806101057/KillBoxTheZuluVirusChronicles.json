Some new 'military' groups arrive near Dr.Chang's apartment, however after landing his plane the scientist and people with him make their way to where he has the lab specimens and his reports. The infected people become totally crazy in a short time, when they all try to kill anybody they see. The new operators on the scene can't be trusted, because the order to get Dr. Chang was changed to Kill him shortly after. Larsen will not do this,but other teams will.Exciting adventure as the group of Chang, Larsen, (from Homeland security) , a policeman, a woman doctor and a few others try to keep everyone alive and safe while finding out that they have become 'throw-aways' , not wanted back in society after what they have seen.I can't wait for the next story!!"}, {"userName": "Chessy The Cat", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7801425-chessy-the-cat", "userReview": "The gang\u2019s all here and then some. Dr. Chang, Larsen, Emma & Jack, and David & Justin are hiding within NevoTech in downtown Indianapolis trying to access Chang\u2019s research and get it to . . . who? Who is the $64k question. Someone wants Chang captured or killed because of his research. He is one of the few in his field that has studied the virus before it was unleashed in over 20 major cities across the US. Unbeknownst to the powers that be Chang has studied this new version of the virus and determined it has been weaponized. Who can he trust to give this information to? And, can he get his group to safety at the same time?There are zombies everywhere. That is the best way to describe those infected with the weaponized virus. They are a murderous bunch attracted by the least little sound or at night, to light sources. Getting past them and the two quarantine zones are some of the challenges Chang and his group face trying to leave NevoTech.Konkoly\u2019s second novel in The Zulu Virus Chronicles, KILL BOX: A Post-Apocalyptic Pandemic Thriller, takes off running and never stops. There is a sense of urgency throughout the story to get out of the quarantine zone and hopefully, to safety away from those that caused this outbreak. The odds are not looking so good in that regard.Even amongst all the chaos and confusion, Konkoly is able to interject some moments of levity. My favorite quote is \u201cYeah. I\u2019m fine. But I\u2019m taking up cross fit when this is over,\u201d said Jack. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize the apocalypse would be this demanding.\u201d Larsen continues to use his sarcastic wit to take the edge off and to defuse serious situations. And, even David is starting to add humor to his dialog.This book is very well written. It grabs your attention immediately which makes it hard to put down. I do not like zombie books but will make an exception in this case. I like this book. I don\u2019t like that it is full of zombies. That is a personal preference and in no way reflects upon Konkoly\u2019s ability to spin a tale. I would dare say that this is one of the better books that he has written.5 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Karina Halt", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45474881-karina-halt", "userReview": "This book was even better then the first one, and that one was good!! I love Steven Konkoly's writing, it's clear, compelling and he makes you care deeply about the characters. A MUST READ! Highly Recommended!"}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14523239-susan", "userReview": "Kill Box is the second book in the Zulu Chronicles series. I found it amazing and complex and the thrills and action keep on coming. Like with Hot Zone, I got caught up in the story and had a hard time putting the book down. This story is violent and not for sensitive readers.The book blurb adequately describes the storyline so I'm not going to repeat all of that info here. This was well written and timely, as you can just imagine this happening at anytime without warning. The author did a good job creating multidimensional characters and in describing what is happening around them. I couldn't help but relate to the characters he created. As usual, everything and everyone is not as it seems. Even though this book encompasses a short time span, there is a lot of action, twists and turns, and surprises to keep you riveted. For those readers who have read the second book in the Black Flagged series will recognize several of the characters and situation. This book has a cliffhanger ending, and the story will be continued in the next book. I look forward to reading more in the series."}, {"userName": "Wonderer", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62391752-wonderer", "userReview": "Whoops! Book #2 did not live up to my expectations based on the end of book 1. It's still an above average apocalypse story, but the dialog seemed much clumsier this time around. The action sequences were well done, so that helps balance out the rough patches in the story telling. The main problem is that the premise is seeming less plausible going into book 3. The idea that some bad actor (the US government or state-sponsored terrorists) thought it was a good plan to infect the populations of a couple dozen major American cities only works if there's a substantial payoff afterward. Konkoly hasn't even hinted at what said payoff would be, so it's making the whole storyline seem unlikely, which is wearing at my suspension of disbelief.I'm going to finish book 3, but I'm not as enthusiastic about the series as I had been.As I mentioned in the progress report, the narrator, Charles Hubbell had a real problem pronouncing \"thermometer\", but other than that, he did a good job again."}, {"userName": "Mike Keller", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54999680-mike-keller", "userReview": "The rage virus has brought the U.S. to it's knees. More than two dozen cities have been infected by a terror weapon, the Rage virus.The strangest mix of characters you would never put together, a cop and his teenage son, a middle-aged married couple, the virologist who first detected the infection, the special operator sent to abduct the scientist, and a few others that give them a hand. This motley crew faces down the shadow operators working for the bunch responsible for this attack.With believable characters doing unbelievable things, against unbeatable odds, you get a story that nearly writes itself! But the author's delicate hand reaches in and stirs the bombs about, tears down a fence or two and tears the wings off airplanes. Heck, all they want to do is get out of the city!This has been an entertaining and exciting series and I can't wait to see how it's going to all come together!

Steven KonkolyA deadly virus has been unleashed on the civilian population. Government sanctioned? For what purpose? What dark secrets motivated this. Can you trust anyone? This is an absolutely thrilling tale of sacrifice, bravery and most important of all a willingness to uphold the values of a civilized society that bond and hold us together. The willingness to die for what you hold dear and believe in. This is an absolutely outstanding read heralding the sacrifices one must must make to survive in a world torn apart.

I love Steven Konkoly's writing. He writes like you are actually there experiencing what his characters are. Sometimes you may think he's going into too much detail for a 5 minute operation, but that just builds the excitement of the thriller. You get to know his characters well and you begin to care about them, get emotional over them, and wonder what's going to happen to them. That's why I can barely wait the month that the next book will come out. Seems Larsen's adventure isn't quite over, and I'm sure his friends will be there to help out."}, {"userName": "Sarah Nave", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50691621-sarah-nave", "userReview": "Best in his genre Steven Konkoly has written a story that pulls you in to the lives of these characters who are in the midst of the worst possible circumstance imaginable.

I gathered something was going on in Indianapolis but what? Then I got it and it started to make sense, except then Konkloy just disregards all the bodies that people must be tripping over? Maybe if they vaporized when they were shot? It could have been better written. I mean if your crazy, seeing anyone is a target, yet he directs them all at the good guys to make the story hold. Can you imagine ten shooters and still being overrun and those overrunning you aren\u2019t shooting, come on.

In my opinion there was simply too much detail - every movement was described meticulously and it made the story drag out. I also did not like the way the female ER doctor kept using the 'f' word - it just didn't seem to gel with the way her character was otherwise portrayed. Other characters swore too but it seemed more in keeping with their persona.If you like a surfeit of military action, guns and 'zombie'-type massacres you'll probably enjoy this. 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Stephen Wells", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10563940-stephen-wells", "userReview": "Thank you Steven Konkoly for your best effort yet.
