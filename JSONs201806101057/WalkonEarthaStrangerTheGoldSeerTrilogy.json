Her dying words, burned into my heart. But she was wrong. When there\u2019s gold to be had, you can\u2019t trust anyone. Not a single soul.\n3 1/2 stars. Walk on Earth a Stranger is a very promising start to this historical/paranormal series set during the California Gold Rush of 1849.Westerns - a genre that has been fairly empty for many years (outside of Western Romance) - are making a comeback. I have read three this year and enjoyed them all - Under a Painted Sky, Vengeance Road and, of course, Walk on Earth a Stranger. 2016 also promises more Western excitement with Revenge and the Wild.I'm trying to make it VERY clear what this book is, because I was under the impression that it was another high fantasy, similar to the author's The Girl of Fire and Thorns trilogy. It isn't. It's primarily a fast-paced historical adventure, with a paranormal twist to make things even more interesting.But whatever, I was hooked from the first chapter. I didn't love Carson's The Girl of Fire and Thorns, but she sure knows how to tug you along for an action-packed ride. And this book is even more compelling. Lee Westfall is an extremely likable, brave and sympathetic character. I was immediately pulled into her story and felt her sadness, her anger, and her frustration following the murder of her parents. It's a very exciting book that jumps from drama to blood-soaked drama. When Lee suspects that her new guardian is responsible for her parents' deaths, she runs away disguised as a boy. On the trail of her friend - Jefferson - who is headed to California, Lee finds herself thrown from one heap of trouble, to surprising friendships, to yet another heap of trouble.But being a girl isn't the only secret Lee must keep. She also has the ability to sense the presence of gold. She is drawn to it. Imagine what this power would mean if a person could control Lee. They would be rich beyond their wildest dreams.I rated down slightly to 3.5 because I think that many of the secondary characters (and there were many) were left underdeveloped. They should have been more complex and nuanced, but the author missed the opportunity to take their characterization further than a basic surface level. I'm hoping this will come later.But otherwise, this was a very enjoyable read. Lots of action, lots of tension, and a slow-burn romance.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Pinterest"}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "DNF at 50%. Where is the plot? Is there a plot?What a disappointment. This book suffers from something that has plagued every single Rae Carson book I've ever read, however good they ended up being: it's slow as molasses. It started off so well, with a strong character and a rare setting in young adult literature.\nI have a strange life; I know it well. We have a big homestead and not enough working hands, so I\u2019m the girl who hunts and farms and pans for gold because her daddy never had sons. I\u2019m forever weary, my hands roughed and cracked, my skirts worn too thin too soon. The town girls poke fun at me, calling me \u201cPlain Lee\u201d on account of my strong hands and my strong jaw. But there\u2019s plenty I love about my life that makes it all just fine: the sunrise on the snowy mountain slopes, a mama and daddy who know my worth, that sweet tingle when a gold nugget sits in the palm of my hand.\nBut it wound up being a huge disappointment to me, because I fully expected to love this book. A long time ago, back in the Paleolithic Era, I was a grade schooler. We had these things called Computer Labs, and once a week, the whole class would get to use it and played (educational) games. My favorite was this game called Oregon Trail. We played as settlers who wandered across the country, fording rivers, hunting wild game, dodging attacks, surviving dysentery. This book was pretty much the same thing, it was fun at first, but it got really boring.This is essentially the plot:Girl has magical gold-finding powers. Girl is unpopular but happy with her life and her parents.Make that WAS HAPPY with her life. Parents got murdered right off. Boo.Girl is assigned a (sinister) guardian. Is there any other kind?Girl runs away! Disguises herself as a guy (not that original, but admittedly, not too many other options)She gets suppliesShe travelsShe gets in troubleShe travels some moreShe gets in more troubleShe travels some moreOh crap! Trouble!Whew, let's travel on!Rinse, repeat until I got sick of all this because it feels like I've gone through all this before while playing a grade-school game. I would give this book the benefit of the doubt, since I did end up enjoying Carson's previous series, but my time is a lot more precious to me these days, and I'm a lot more impatient."}, {"userName": "Jessica \u2741 \u27b3 Silverbow \u27b3 \u2741 Rabid Reads-no-more", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10336538-jessica-silverbow-rabid-reads-no-more", "userReview": "Reviewed by: Rabid Reads4.5 starsThis book . . . GAH.I was already a HUGE fan of Rae Carson from reading her \nFire and Thorns\n books, so I was dying in the interim between series, scavenging for any bit of information I could find about what she was working on next.And the more I learned, the more excited I became: a girl on the run with the ability to sense gold like a dowsing rod . . . during the California Gold Rush . . .Pretty cool, right? I'm not a huge fan of American history, but even I thought that was a pretty great scenario.In hindsight, I feel kind of silly for not seeing the inevitable similarities between traveling in wagons across the county to California and traveling across the country in wagons . . . on the OREGON TRAIL.BUT. As an adult, I finally grasped the gravity of the situation.It was not an easy trip. People traveled in huge caravans b/c there was safety in numbers. A family would start the journey with a wagon jam-packed with various \"necessities\" they refused to leave behind, and the longer they traveled, the more stuff they tossed out, b/c they learned: if it isn't food or water, it's not important.REAL people were dying from real diseases. LOTS of them. Not just random stick figures I'd named after my fourth grade best friends.But Carson didn't only capture the realities of long-distance travel in Gold Rush-era America, she captured the mindsets. The blas\u00e9 attitude that went hand-in-hand with the prejudices. The irony of the American settlers' response to perceived Native American threats. The desperation of women who were wholly dependent on their husbands b/c they had no rights of their own. The blind stupid belief of religious men who expected God to everything for them, believing that taking any type of precautionary action was a \"lack of faith.\"It was heartbreaking and infuriating and thought-provoking and, above all other things, REAL.Viscerally real.Which is quite an accomplishment for a YA fantasy novel.My only complaint was that there were several shocking plot twists that---BAM!---hit you at the very beginning, and I hadn't had enough time with Leah to really be affected by the awful things that happened to her. B/c they were awful. Horrible, tragic things. But I only felt them cerebrally, not emotionally.BUT. It was a problem that was short-lived. By the time I was one-third of the way through it, I was well and truly ensnared. I tore through the pages, finishing only six(ish) hours after starting it. And I'll admit, around the 90% mark I started getting worried . . . I could almost see a cliffhanger ending biting its thumb at me in the distance . . .Thankfully, it was all in my head. I finished in agony, but only the agony that springs from finishing a truly great book and knowing that you have a year to wait before finding out what happens next. *wipes sweat from brow*WALK ON EARTH A STRANGER is pure gold. In this phenomenal first installment of Rae Carson's new GOLD SEER TRILOGY, you will meet a fascinating cast of characters whose journey from the Southern United States all the way to California will spring to life as you feverishly inhale chapter after chapter, willfully ignoring silly things like food and shelter b/c you physical CANNOT put it down. At least I couldn't. Highly recommended.Pre-review:This book . . . I LOVED it. A slow(ish) start was my only real issue, and it resolved itself by the 1/3rd mark.I loved the characters.I loved the story.I laughed, I cried, I wrung my hands, I swooned, I LOVED IT.Full review to come closer to the release date."}, {"userName": "Hailey (HaileyinBookland)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21937982-hailey-haileyinbookland", "userReview": "4.5*I really enjoyed this!!!

That feeling when you just can\u2019t get into any book. I\u2019ve started feeling this way recently, having started at least five novels in the last five days and not finishing a single one. I just couldn\u2019t feel anything towards them. Is it me or is it the book? Either way, I was a wreck with the guilt, considering the backlog of books, ARCs and otherwise, that have been on my shelves for months.Leave it to Rae Carson\u2019s fantastic storytelling skills and genuine characters to pull me out of that abyss. ALL HAIL THE QUEEN!This book gave me newfound life. The Gold Rush era + an uncanny ability to feel the presence of gold wherever they are + a gender bender during a time when women are seen as something to be taken care and owned?! This is definitely one of the most unique premises I\u2019ve read recently, and Carson owned it with Leah Westfall\u2019s character, the only daughter of gold miner parents who was killed by someone after her abilities.Leah Westfall is the fricking bomb, guys. I love her to kingdom come. She is headstrong, level-headed, and determined; she isn\u2019t afraid to get her hands dirty mucking stalls, hunting game, and looking for gold during a time when women were seen as only good enough for childbirth and laundry. Because of the unfortunate circumstances that befell upon her, she is forced to present herself as a boy in order to find a new life elsewhere, all the way to California where it was rumored numerous amounts of gold were found. And I don\u2019t blame her at all for wanting to take this direction, especially during a time when bandits and thieves prey on lonely travelers. Women back then weren\u2019t taken seriously when it came to business, either, so she had to disguise herself and take on a new identity in order to be able to do the things she was good at.But even though her hands are calloused with the hard work she\u2019s given throughout the years, she is still a vulnerable and relatable heroine and my heart ached and felt for her for the loneliness, danger, and restlessness she felt as she traveled and look for Jefferson, her best friend, who went on to California ahead of her. I can\u2019t imagine what I would done if I were in her own shoes. Would I endure an uncle treating me like cattle, or be in control of my own life but be in risk of other dangers? I really like that despite everything, Leah simply wants to be able to be herself \u2013 not to be seen as a useless woman good for child-bearing and washing, but simply as Leah who can do these things and still be more.And may I remind you, this took place in 1849 in the California Gold Rush. The only thing about this book is that 80% of it is composed of traveling, so it may be too snail-paced to other people. I mean, America is huge! People back then didn\u2019t have airplanes and trains were just starting to be built. People traveled the old-fashioned way \u2013 by walking, horseback, or wagons. And oh, steamships and flatboats, too. Because of this, the book is largely composed of Leah and her friends trying to survive the travel to California. They encounter bandits, hordes of buffalos, sickness. They go through mountains, through long rivers that take weeks to travel, and the scorching hot desert. They meet all kinds of people along the way \u2013 suspicious ones, endearing ones, slimy ones \u2013 and it\u2019s all just so mesmerizing.Yes, the pace is slow, but I loved every page, every second of it. Leah is an amazing, rootable character who is strong and full of life and resolve. I love how she took her life in her own hands and proved how people\u2019s impression of her were wrong again and again. I love how even though certain individuals were demotivating her, even though she made fatal mistakes here and there, she never gave up and always, always, stood up again.The only thing that I wasn\u2019t really feeling here was the romance. It didn\u2019t really feel genuine to me, although that may be because Jefferson was never a key character to Leah\u2019s development and well-being. He was more behind the scenes most of the time and I guess that\u2019s why I just couldn\u2019t connect with him, and thus, couldn\u2019t back their feelings for each other. But, hey, having read Carson\u2019s previous series before, this may change.All in all, this book is insanely good. Don\u2019t mind the slow pace and just bask in Leah\u2019s character and character development, and the relationships she creates with other people who are as interesting and diverse. Trust me on this one, guys!"}, {"userName": "Cait \u2022 A Page with a View", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47412532-cait-a-page-with-a-view", "userReview": "So this is definitely more historical fiction than fantasy FYI. The only fantasy aspect is that the main character has the \"witchy power\" ability to sense gold, but that really doesn't come into play very often. This was mostly a story of a girl who heads west disguised as a boy and meets an assortment of typical mid-1800s characters along the way. The story reminded me a lot of Under a Painted Sky and other YA stories of girls fleeing to California for freedom. There are all the typical threats along the trail: dehydration, cholera, Indians, thieves, snakes, buffalo stampedes, etc.I absolutely loved The Oregon Trail computer game, Little House on the Prairie, and pretty much anything to do with pioneers as a kid, so I was totally into this story! I thought it had a solid mix of characters and felt like a decently realistic portrayal of that time period (for all I know).The romance was super slow-burn almost to the point where it's barely there, but I suppose it just built a solid foundation for the next book. The story IS super slow moving, but I actually didn't mind that for the most part. It's more of a peaceful pace instead of boring. The author did a great job of capturing the main character's voice and the setting! So I like where this is heading overall and will totally check out the next book!"}, {"userName": "C.G.

And in many ways this book didn\u2019t disappoint \u2013 it contained many of the things I loved about Rae Carson the first time around \u2013 however, I just didn\u2019t love it as much. I\u2019m clearly in the minority here since it seems that many readers actually preferred this book to The Girl of Fire and Thorns, but for me, the latter was just more complex, more fascinating and I felt much more attached to the characters. Walk on Earth a Stranger has a rare setting for a YA novel: the 19th century California Gold Rush. It was a very interesting period to write about and Rae Carson did a commendable job portraying the time authentically. The novel is historical fiction with a little bit of paranormal thrown in; don\u2019t go into it expecting a fantasy novel.The story starts when Leah Westfall decides to run away from home to California because she believes that her new guardian is responsible for her parents\u2019 death. But because society is what it is, Leah has to disguise herself as a boy. She follows the path that she hopes her best friend Jefferson took a few weeks earlier and hopes to meet him on the journey there. What nobody knows - not even Jefferson - is that Leah has a secret, a secret that may prove deadly under the circumstances: she can sense the presence of gold. A girl with this ability during the Gold Rush era? There are bound to be many conflicts. Before I get into the things that I did enjoy about the novel, let me tell you why I only rated it 3 stars. The main reason was the plot. I\u2019ve started to realize that I\u2019m not very fond of journey stories. The kind where a major event happens at the beginning to set the story in motion, and the rest is basically just a description of how the characters manage to get to a certain place within a certain time and the troubles they encounter. After the initial starting point \u2013 which drew me into the story immediately \u2013 things start to slow down considerably. There is little plot and the story is very stop-and-go. Leah travels, there is trouble, more traveling, more trouble. The issues she encounters are realistic and depict an accurate and vivid picture of what it was like to journey through America at the time, however, it became repetitive and predictable early on and I started loosing interest around the 40% mark. To me, it feels like this story was unnecessarily stretched out into a series, it needed to be more compact. Undoubtedly, Rae Carson has the ability to create realistic and likable characters. I never found Leah to be annoying or whiny, instead she is a strong female character, brave and determined. Even better, she goes through considerable character development throughout the novel. She wants to be seen as an equal, not someone in need of rescue. Leah also doesn\u2019t judge other women. Rae Carson is the queen of female friendships in YA literature: the females aren\u2019t torn apart by jealousy or unnecessary misunderstandings. Despite all these positives however, I could never truly connect with Leah. I liked her, but she just wasn\u2019t interesting or memorable enough to compensate for the lack of plot. Similarly, I thought the slow-burn romance was realistic but I never felt the spark. It didn\u2019t help that Leah\u2019s magical ability had very little presence in the story. Something I did enjoy, was how the author explored many of the social issues of the time. Sexism, homosexuality, discrimination against the Native Americans, xenophobia\u2026all of these issues are touched upon, yet it never became overbearing. Ultimately, I did really like many aspects of this book, but they weren\u2019t enough to make me engaged in the story. For me, this was a book that was trying to be more plot-driven than character-driven, but it never hooked me and consequently it didn\u2019t realize its full potential on either account. It didn\u2019t leave me feeling satisfied. I do think this book is a promising start to the series and if the reviews for the sequel are positive I will pick up the next one. And if not, I\u2019m still very excited for any future books Rae Carson writes."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "Hey guys, this book is $1.99 on kindle today 9-17-2016 and I also saw it yesterday on Bookoulet for really cheap for the hardcover.

She's so strong and goes through some terrible things that I just can't imagine. I felt sorry for what happens to her and all because of greed. But, she figures out what she needs to do to make sure she survives. As we all know, Lee can sense gold. She can feel it's pull in the ground, in someone's pocket, it doesn't really matter.. it calls to her. That would be nice wouldn't it? The best version of a metal detector I can think of!!! But she finds nuggets by just feeling the pull and this can be a blessing and a curse! What ever you do.. DON'T. LET. IT. LEEK. OUT. THAT. YOU. HAVE. THIS.

Even though I only gave this book a 3.5, I intend on reading the whole trilogy as I do like the book. But let me tell you right now, my favorite character in the book is Peony! See image below :)Yes, Peony is Lee's Palomino and I love her and nothing better happen to her!!

Evidently, I enjoy historical fiction with hard working young girls without families making it in the world all by themselves (see my highly rated \"Hattie Big Sky\" and \"The Hired Girl.\")What I don't like in books like this, I guess, are dull and dour narrators with no sense of humor and lacking in optimism, long, boring treks and the stories unnecessarily stretched out into series.Gold Rush was an interesting era to write about, but this story needed to be more compact and more exciting to get me through hundreds of pages of people going from one place to another while dying of measles, childbirth, etc. It may be that thousand page-long Outlander novels have ruined me for enjoying this type of walk-get injured-die of gangrene-die of childbirth-get attacked by Indians-walk some more adventure.

I have a huge weakness for fantasy western settings and themes exploring wild frontiers, so a story set in Gold Rush-era America about a young woman trying to make her way to California sounded exactly like something I would enjoy.Ahem. Then came several of my Goodreads friends\u2019 reviews comparing it to The Oregon Trail.Okay, hold up a second. The Oregon Trail? THE OREGON TRAIL?!! I loved that game growing up. I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that I still dig it up to play every few years, just to relive the nostalgia. If this book lives up to even just a fraction of those descriptions, it was going to be awesome.But the best has yet to come. Not long after I started this book, I was delighted to discover that In Walk on Earth a Stranger, the protagonist is a girl named Leah Westfall who has to take on the guise of a boy, becoming Lee McCauley in order to strike it out on her own cross-country.Why, yes, the girl-disguised-as-boy trope happens to be one of my favorites, actually.Perhaps my love for this book was a forgone conclusion, perhaps not. Regardless, I don\u2019t hand out full marks lightly, especially when it comes to Young Adult fiction. Folks know I\u2019m super picky about my YA. As I was reading, I was looking for other things to fall into place, because nothing frustrates me more than a great idea undermined by shoddy execution. This being my first book by Rae Carson, her writing and storytelling was also a big question mark to me so I had no idea what to expect.As you can see though, I ended up enjoying every moment! I was also very impressed with Carson\u2019s writing, so much so that I want to rush to add her other books to my TBR, post-haste.Still, I\u2019m not sure that I would enjoy anything as much as I did Walk on Earth a Stranger. True, this book features several themes I like, but it also deviates from a lot of YA conventions, which is probably another reason why I took to it so completely.First of all, if you like a lot of magic in your fantasy, you\u2019re not going to find much of it here. The only fantasy element in this book is Lee\u2019s special power, her ability to sense gold around her. A most handy talent for someone with plans to head out west during the Gold Rush hoping to make their fortune, but it doesn\u2019t come into play throughout much of the story, which mostly involves a lot of traveling. And traveling. And more traveling.Which brings me to my second caveat. If you\u2019re seeking action and excitement, a fast-paced plot to get your blood pumping in your veins, Walk on Earth a Stranger is not really that kind of story. It is a tale of survival, with as much focus on the emotional journey as the physical one. Let\u2019s go back to The Oregon Trail comparison. You remember all the horrible things that could befall your company, right? You had everything from buffalo stampedes to little Mary has the measles. The point is, not every danger or threat is immediate; some, in truth, are pretty boring and routine. Doesn\u2019t mean they still can\u2019t kill you though, if you don\u2019t have help. Thus, while brute force and personal determination might help get you to California, so too does the power of cooperation and forging lasting friendships. No, this book isn\u2019t exactly a page-turner, but what you do get is your character development and meaningful relationships in spades. The people you meet in this book will become your family. Whenever good things happened to the characters, I couldn\u2019t help but feel giddy with joy. And when they experienced tragedy, my heart ached along with theirs.Third caveat: If you need a love story, you can forget it. While the slightest hint of lovey-dovey feelings are ever present between Lee and her best friend Jefferson, the romance is so slow-burning that it is virtually non-existent. Wait, you mean, there\u2019s no unnecessary romantic drama to get in the way of the story? Perfect! Lee does end up feeling jealous towards another girl in their wagon train, but eventually the two of them actually become friends. I can\u2019t tell you how refreshing that is, especially these days when it feels like every four out of five YA novels I read that has a female character who\u2019s not the main protagonist, they inevitably become bitter enemies. It\u2019s nice to see a potential rival end up an ally for a change.Another nice thing about this book is that it can be read as a self-contained story. Of course, Rae Carson leaves plenty of breadcrumbs along this journey to pick up for the later books, but she\u2019s not leaving us with any burning questions or an infuriating cliffhanger. Honestly, I don\u2019t need any of those to want to read the sequel; a chance to spend more time with the wonderful characters I met in this book is already incentive enough for me. This is YA fiction done right, in my opinion, with a charming approach to history and just a light brush of fantasy. I loved it, and I want more like this."}, {"userName": "Lucia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8837962-lucia", "userReview": "After surprise attack that shuttered Leah\u2019s family, Leah has no other choice but dress as a boy and set up on dangerous journey to California - a place where she can put her secret gift of sensing gold to use during American Gold Rush era and start a new life for herself.

The use of period slang and words, detailed descriptions of museum worthy things; it all sounded very authentic to me and showed me clear picture of given historical period.Fantasy aspect is important but somehow it doesn\u2019t play a leading role in this book. I didn\u2019t mind one bit since story concentrated mostly on heroine\u2019s thrilling journey across the nation for the chance at new beginning, not her ability. But I have a feeling that it will play much bigger role in next instalment!Plot-wise, author had it thought out to tiny details. There were no plot holes and no frustrating moments. In this novel you will find only rich world-building, slow burn romance, unforgettable characters and fascinating setting of 1850s. A book nerd like me could not ask for more. Author wasn\u2019t even afraid to touch topic of slavery and Indians which gave this novel more serious vibe.

It super sad sad our main character Lee had to be dressed as a boy to get anything done. There are moments where other side female characters had to defer to their husbands in every way. Like they were property and not a human being. The men and women roles in this one had me reeling! There was just so much sexism I could take. I don't know how women back then could take it. Maybe only because they didn't know any better and having equal rights was something they could never dream of.\u00a0Rae's writing is just as vivid and surreal as her other trilogy which I loved so. She paints a picture of families trying to make a better place out in the west. Along the way our characters lose each other or sometimes themselves. I loved reading how much Lee changes and how strong she is to be able to do the things that she does.This is all about the journey and even though it has some magical elements, it wasn't the focus. It was about getting to the destination in one piece. I've never read about a journey to the western side of America before but Rae Carson has a way with words that gets me interested and enthralled at the same time. Excellent writing! What a wonderful journey Rae Carson has written. Her characters are so strong and independent! I loved it! A girl who has to look like a boy to make it to California and she naturally senses out gold.. I was enthralled at every page.

Walk on Earth a Stranger is a teen hero story version of The Oregon Trail.I like the Gold Rush Era, it's a fascinating time in US history.

I did not want a history lesson, I wanted a YA paranormal romance book in a historical setting. Unfortunately I got the former and not the latter.Lee has this amazing power to sense gold from a distance and sniff it out. She could be rich beyond imagining or use her power to help people in need. But no, Lee takes advantage of her ability only maybe once or twice in the whole book. In fact, her family is poor and her best friend is even poorer. I never understood why Lee let the people close to her suffer poverty when she could easily help them out.Basically, Walk on Earth a Stranger was too slow, too boring.

It is currently 2:18 AM in my neck of the woods so I will have a review up tomorrow. But for right now all you need to know is this book is amazing and YOU NEED TO READ IT. **Minor Spoilers Ahead**\n\"The presence of gold fades with distance, but never leaves me. Maybe, in California, it will infuse me constantly, like the warmth of my own private sun.\"\nThis is the first book I've read by Rae Carson and it certainly will not be the last. I loved her writing and the characters she created. She did not hold back in this book when it came the history and the events that occurred within the story. Life, death, violence, anger, HISTORY, all of these things came together to create a truly magnificent story. \n \u201c\u2019This nugget is nothing, Lee. Even your magic is nothing. You\u2019re a good girl and the best daughter. And that? That\u2019s something.\u2019\u2018Yes, Daddy.\u2019\u201d \nThe story is told in the perspective of our butt-kicking heroine, Leah Westfall. We first meet Leah in the woods of Dahlonega, Georgia in January of 1849. The Mexican-American War has just ended a year earlier and one of the results of this was President James K. Polk acquiring the California territory. This would forever change the United States as well as Leah Westfall\u2019s life. Leah\u2019s parents are tragically murdered in the beginning of the story. After this event Leah\u2019s Uncle Hiram comes into the picture. He intends to take over Leah\u2019s home and life, and Leah sees that the freedom she experienced with her parents is quickly being taken away. The only way she can truly be free is if she heads west to find her best friend Jefferson and escape into California where her Uncle Hiram has no power over her. So Leah disguises herself as a boy and she starts on a journey that will be extremely tough but also fulfilling in Leah\u2019s search for herself. \n \u201cSo it\u2019s now, with my own fire crackling, my lips greasy with the squirrel I just ate, and the night echoing with the distant yip of a coyote that I miss Daddy most. He should be here with me. We should have been on this adventure together.\u201d\nOne part that really struck me was when Leah was travelling alone in the beginning of the novel. She is such a strong character and person but the reader still must remember that she is still grieving for both her parents and the life she had before. Rae Carson made Leah\u2019s emotions so real and her grief actually made me emotional. A lot of this book made me emotional actually. However, we see Leah eventually find Jefferson and find people that she comes to care for and care for her. \n \u201cTrust someone, Mama said. Her dying words, burned into my heart. But she was wrong. When there\u2019s gold to be had, you can\u2019t trust anyone. Not a single soul.\u201d \nLeah has a secret power. She can sense gold, whether it\u2019s in the Earth or it\u2019s a necklace around someone\u2019s neck. It is a dangerous ability for any person to have because of the lust for gold during the California Gold Rush. This lust is partly what drove her Uncle to murder her parents and she knows she has to keep this a secret from everyone, including her best friend Jefferson. Although Leah begins the story unwilling to trust anyone, she learns along the way that there are people she can trust. Her growth throughout the novel is shown in her interactions with Jefferson and the other families that she travels with to California. I loved the entire journey that Leah was on. It brought me back to my Oregon Trail days. I was OBSESSED with that game when I was little kid. My mom allowed me to play on our dinosaur of a computer for only an hour a day and Oregon Trail was my go to game. Rae Carson made me feel like I was there on the trail with Leah. It was so realistic and actually really historically accurate. I am a history major and I\u2019ve learned my fair share of American history. It\u2019s never been my favorite history to learn about but I\u2019ve always loved learning about this era with the California Gold Rush and the move west. The scene that really killed me was the buffalo scene because that kind of thing actually happened. The measles blankets also really made me angry, because again it\u2019s something that people actually did. Rae Carson does an amazing job of including real history in this story and it was such a breath of fresh air. \n \u201cSeems like I\u2019ve been waiting for you to come around my whole life, Lee. But a man can\u2019t wait forever and stay a man.\u201d \nI just want to say a few things about the relationship between Leah and Jefferson. First of all, I loved their relationship. They have been best friends forever but now that they\u2019re older it seems like it could be more. Rae Carson made their relationship develop very slowly and that was so great. We hardly have any romance in this novel, it\u2019s not the main focus and that\u2019s what helps make this novel great. I totally thought Jefferson and Therese were going to have something and I was going to get annoyed but that\u2019s not the case. I can\u2019t wait to see where this relationship goes.\n \u201cThere\u2019s not a place in the whole world where everyone isn\u2019t willing\u2014no, eager\u2014to give up a girl to a man.\u201d \nCan we talk about the feminist undertones in this book? Obviously, we can talk about Leah and her independence but we can also really analyze Becky Joyner as well. I even like Mrs. Joyner now! She was a you-know-what in the beginning but she really grew on me. Her unpleasantness stems from her husband, in my opinion. And once he dies I think she is able to find that independence that all women in their lives want. Leah\u2019s transformation is really at the forefront of the novel but as a reader I also loved watching Becky\u2019s transformation as well. She is a mother who cares only for her children and she does everything in her power to protect them even if that means to be rude and harsh to people like Leah. However, over the course of this journey Becky Joyner learns more about being a woman and that there\u2019s more to life than being a wife.This book is one of the only books where I haven\u2019t been annoyed with a single character. Yeah I didn\u2019t like some of the bad guys but they all worked in the story and I enjoy reading about them. I just really can\u2019t wait to read the next book. I love all of these characters and their relationships with one another. I would recommend it to everyone, especially if you love American history and are in the mood for a journey because this book really takes you on one. I feel like I\u2019ve written an essay but this book has really had an impact on me. My only regret is that I wish I read it sooner!\n \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so far from God\u2019s grace. I suppose I am a stranger walking on Earth, but I\u2019m no son of God. I\u2019m no son at all.\u201d \nHappy reading, friends! \u263aYou can also find this review on my blog here:http://soreadyourbooksbutstayoutlate...."}, {"userName": "Maggie \u2618 (Reader in Wonderland)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40477684-maggie-reader-in-wonderland", "userReview": "*2.5/5 stars*I'm really sad that this book didn't work out for me. I love Carson's Fire and Thorns trilogy so I expected to fall in love with this book as well, sadly it didn't happen. Walk on Earth a Stranger is not a bad book by any stretch of the word, but it wouldn't be for everyone either. Objectively, yes, it's quite great book, but I felt so very disconnected from everything. The characters - while I found the MC admirable, I couldn't really connect to her, neither any other characters (aside for very few like Mrs. Joyner - who had great development - and Jef), I didn't even remember who all the side character actually were or their names. The plot was extremely slow, boring and repetative (it took me a month to read this book and I almost DNF'd it) and the fact that I didn't really care about the world building - even though it seems very realistic - or didn't feel any nostalgia or whatewer toward it didn't help either. On a more positive note, though, I really liked how this book portrayed many things concerning that time period: There was expressed diversity in terms of sexuaility and race. This story realistically portrayed the hate and disrimination against Native Americans befitting that time.And sexism - just as Carson't previous series, this book was quietly feminist and had many ampowering messages and quotes without it being too much. Also, zero f/f hate. All the things were mastefully baded into the story. *******************************Pre-review:I'm kind of weary starting this book because the premise of this story doesn't sound as interesting to me, but I loved Fire and Thornes trilogy by Rae Carson - book two and three were among my all time favourites, and her stories always seem quitly feminist and diverse. So hopefully I'll like this one as well."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8575414-emma", "userReview": "4.5 stars. A fascinating account of a bunch of disparate people in one wagon train and their determination to get to California in 1849 at the beginning of the Gold Rush. The main character is an orphaned girl who brings the group together through her courage and kindness of spirit.As well as an excellent work of historical fiction, this novel is intended to have a light touch of fantasy to it. I think if you were anticipating this book based on that alone, it is possible you would be disappointed. I know I was; however I love historical fiction in general and the Gold Rush is a favourite period of mine, so really it was difficult to stay disappointed for long!Really looking forward to reading the next in series where hopefully the fantasy element will make a more significant appearance.

Leah \"Lee\" Westfall is a very special girl, she can witch up gold. She can sense the presence of gold and the bigger the piece, the stronger the sensation she feels. Needless to say that a girl with her abilities is a prime asset in their gold rush town, but I imagine it will be useless in our time and age. Lee and her family kept this special ability a secret. Instead of striking out and making it big panning or mining gold, Lee is content running their modest homestead. Then one fateful day, her quiet life is violently torn away from her. With nothing else left, Lee ventures out to California, where wealth awaits a girl with her gold-divining abilities.Lee travels from Georgia to California, that's 2,454.8 miles of lawless and hostile lands. Surely, it makes for great adventure on paper but just imagine actually doing the land travel with only oxen and horses, doing your personal things in rivers and bushes, drinking waters from streams and bathing only when there's an opportunity to do so. Terrible. Walk on Earth A Stranger satisfactorily described the hardships of long journeys. I appreciate the depiction of sleeping on the cold hard ground more than sleeping under the stars more. I know it can be both but there's nothing romantic about it when you know you have months of it ahead.Technically, there is nothing wrong with this novel, it is well written, the narrator's voice is authentically southern and the characters were likable enough, but I did not feel connected with any of them at all. Lee is a good character, too good if you ask me. She's brave, selfless and can shoot a thimble off a man's head, but I didn't care about her at all. Even after all the tragedy she went through, she remained the same old good Lee. If you ask me, the author missed a good opportunity to develop a more complex Lee.I enjoyed the first 40% or so of this book, but as the novel progressed though it got kind of predictable. As soon as they hit the trail, there was noticeable pattern of travelling, stopping for trouble, then more travelling, more trouble repeat until you get to California. Given, they're different kinds of troubles, take your pick of diseases, accidents, childbirth, etc. There were also some Hallmark moments I found terribly uncharacteristic of the setting. However, take this with enough salt to turn the Dead Sea with, because for some this would be enough, but I've always pictured survival in the Wild West to be unkind and scrambling, so sadly, I found Walk on Earth a Stranger underwhelming.Walk on Earth A Stranger is a YA historical with a touch of magic. Yes, you read that right, historical. I thought it was gonna be heavy on the fantasy, but it's more historical than anything else.

A young woman with the magical ability to sense the presence of gold must flee her home, taking her on a sweeping and dangerous journey across Gold Rush\u2013era America.Lee Westfall has a secret. She can sense the presence of gold in the world around her. Veins deep beneath the earth, pebbles in the river, nuggets dug up from the forest floor. The buzz of gold means warmth and life and home\u2014until everything is ripped away by a man who wants to control her. Left with nothing, Lee disguises herself as a boy and takes to the trail across the country. Gold was discovered in California, and where else could such a magical girl find herself, find safety? Rae Carson, author of the acclaimed Girl of Fire and Thorns trilogy, dazzles with this new fantasy that subverts both our own history and familiar fantasy tropes.Walk on Earth a Stranger, the first book in this new trilogy, introduces\u2014as only Rae Carson can\u2014a strong heroine, a perilous road, a fantastical twist, and a slow-burning romance. Includes a map and author\u2019s note on historical research. What I Liked:I absolutely ADORED Rae Carson's Fire & Thorns series. I'd read The Girl of Fire and Thorns before blogging (mid-2012), but read The Crown of Embers and The Bitter Kingdom as they were published. Such an agonizing wait for The Bitter Kingdom! I loved that the series got better with each book. I'm really hoping that the same will apply for this series.Leah Westfall can sense gold, which is a handy ability during the Gold Rush. No one knows about her ability excerpt her parents - and her uncle who murders her parents and tells Lee they will be heading West, him and her. Lee runs away, journeying to the West on her own. On the way, she joins a family - the Joyners - and a friend who also ran away - Jefferson - and it's not long before Lee feels like she has a place in the group that she's traveling with. But Lee has more secrets than one - she can sense gold, but she's also masquerading as a boy.Rae Carson has certainly created a unique and rich story, scene, and cast of characters. I haven't read many Westerns, or books set in nineteenth-century United States, in YA. I actually just read Vengeance Road by Erin Bowman, and it follows the EXACT PLOT (except Kate can't sense gold). Parents are killed (parent, in Kate's case), girl goes out on her own, gold is a huge factor in the story. I LOVED Vengeance Road, but I didn't quite love this one.Still, I was very interested in this story, from start to finish. Despite this book being slightly longer than most YA books (which doesn't bother me!), the story moves at a decent pace. I have a dislike about the pacing actually, but it's a little different (see below). I wasn't bored, even though the plot wasn't terribly fast. I liked Lee from the start. She is an only child, with no brother, so she does all of the labor that a boy would normally do, including mucking the stables and whatnot. She also pans for gold, since she has the gold sense. Lee takes care of her family, so when her parents are murdered, Lee knows that she can't let her uncle treat her like property. Lee is strong (and not just physically) and brave, brave enough to start her journey to California (from Georgia) by herself.Jefferson is her friend from Georgia, who leaves for the West before she does, just after her parents are murdered. The pair don't meet up until Lee reaches Independence (Missouri, I believe) with the Joyners. Jefferson is half-white, half-Native-American, and is used to people treating him terribly. He keeps Lee's secret about being a girl from everyone, but he doesn't know about her gold sense.Overall, I thought the story was interesting, maybe not engaging though (see below). I expect a lot more from the next books, which should be the case, given what I know about the Fire & Thorns series.What I Did Not Like:My biggest issue with this book is that I felt it was going nowhere. Lee is on a journey to the West, okay. But is that it? It really seemed like that was it. We REALLY get to know the people in the group she's traveling with (the Joyners, but also a few other family, and Major Craven, some college boys, and more). But there is no additional layer to the book. You'd think Lee's gold sense would come back to haunt her at some point, or Uncle Hiram would find her and kidnap her and force her to find gold. I don't know what I was expecting, but I think I expected MORE. This book was so one-dimensional, one-layered.Not to say that it was boring? But it moved in one direction, and that direction wasn't really anywhere. Going to the West. The end. Is the book about making friends along the way? Golly gee, I really don't think that's what I wanted to read, or expected to read. Given that her last series was a high fantasy one, I think I expected this book to have shenanigans going on.So I'd say the pacing was slow. Interesting, not terribly boring, but slow. Also, let's talk about anachronisms. Some of the speech and dialogue in this book were definitely anachronistic. I wish I had bookmarked where I saw these lines, but I didn't want to dog-ear my book! But I distinctly remember thinking, that sentence is way too modern, at least a few times. Not a huge deal, but not a good thing, necessarily. The ending felt so anticlimactic. I think this goes along the lines of what I was saying earlier, about the story being flat, but the ending felt like nothing really changed? Sure, there were plenty of deaths along the way, but the actual climax and ending didn't seem riveting or anything. It was just there. Just another day in the West. La la la.Also, isn't it strange that certain people caught up to the group in the West, while traveling? The West is a HUGE place... it seemed way too coincidental. Too convenient.This last thing I'm going to mention isn't *really* a complaint, but more of a comment for those like me who enjoy a good romance alongside a story - the romance isn't really a thing in this book. Sure, there are seeds, but not happens, nothing is going on. Just seeds. Please water them in the next book, Rae Carson. Knowing what I know about the Fire & Thorns series, I'm sure that will be the case.Would I Recommend It:Despite not loving this one, I'd recommend it! It's fun to read different genres, and Western historical fiction is definitely one that I don't read nearly enough. Granted, there aren't that many published in YA lit. Me reading two Westerns in one year is impressive, let alone two in two months! Even if you don't like Westerns, give this book a shot! I think things will pick up in the next book.Rating:3 stars. I hope to see more related to Lee's gold sense. I hope to see more once Lee and the gang reach California and tuck in. There needs to be more to the plot, because right now, this story isn't meaning much to me! Still, I am interested in the next book, as I trust Rae Carson."}, {"userName": "Rashika (is tired)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8492956-rashika-is-tired", "userReview": "***This review has also been posted on The Social Potato\nWalk on Earth a Stranger may just be the best YA Western I\u2019ve read so far.

I mean lots of things are my thing, but I always find myself craving a good old adventure. Across a country, to the top of the mountains, WHEREVER. I love living vicariously through characters journeying to some place and\u00a0reading about the hardships they have to overcome. But that is just me as a reader and not everyone wants to read\u00a0an entire book reading about a character\u2019s journey. Some people will want more.I don\u2019t have much to go on but I have noticed that all the YA Westerns I\u2019ve read so far, parents seem to die and I am not sure how I feel about this trope. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if parents actually got to live and if there were other catalysts to inspire these journeys across the wild west? There were a bunch of other tropes but I kind of just moved on from them once we got to the actual journey bits.

I loved reading about her, I loved being inside of her head and I LOVED getting to be a part of her journey. When her parents are suddenly killed and it becomes obvious that her uncle, her new guardian was responsible, Leah decides to run. Leah is smart. A lot of female leads are smart, but I love that Leah is not someone who rushes things. When she decided to run away from her uncle, she actually decided to stay an extra couple days so she could plan and get things ready. She also knows how to take care of herself but realizes that when running away, groups are better than individuals.This book also features a diverse set of characters which is awesome. We have the \u201cconfirmed bachelors\u201d, we have Hamptom who is a slave and Leah\u2019s best friend Jeff who is half\u00a0Native American and thus has to deal with with a lot of prejudice and resist the urge to punch people (or was that just me?)What I loved about this book is that it not only featured diverse characters, it also addressed a lot of important issues of the time. The book brought up the injustices being committed against various races by the Caucasians (trying to be PC here and not say white people) and it also showed us instances of where assholes did horrible things because of their assumed superiority.The writing was also terrific although I did find myself sometimes slipping into the \u2018cowboy slang\u2019 from Vengeance Road. If you read my review for Vengeance Road, you\u2019ll know that the cowboy slang had actually bothered me in the beginning,\u00a0but here I was finishing off certain sentences the way they would have been if this book were written in the same style as Vengeance Road. Having said that, I thought the writing style was perfectly suited to the situation and really did make me feel like I was right in the middle of it all, journeying across the continent with Leah and company.The book also has a slight fantasy aspect, given Leah\u2019s gold-detecting powers but their origin wasn\u2019t really explored and to be honest, it really didn\u2019t bother me that it wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t need the answers to all the questions and I was okay letting her powers be (especially since there were so many other awesome things happening.)There is also a subtle romance in the book. My shippy senses were already tingling as soon as I was introduced to the two characters so to finally see my ship sail towards the end of the book made me so happy! It\u2019s a friends-to-more kind of romance and it just made sense given how well they (yes, I am purposefully avoiding naming who the love interest is) worked together and how supportive they were of each other.As I mentioned earlier, this book is all about the journey. In fact, after the first 20 percent or so, the entire book IS the journey Leah makes from her town in Georgia to Sacramento, California. The journey was so well written and SO DETAILED. I was FANGIRLING and was up until 5:00 in the morning reading the book! I literally couldn\u2019t take my eyes off the pages and all I wanted to know was what hardship they would have to face next and how they'd overcome it. I wanted to know how many people would make it to California (because people do die and it was heartbreaking.)This book is perfect for readers who enjoy stories of survival and adventure. It is detailed, heartbreaking and at the same time manages to fill you with so much joy. I LOVE THIS BOOK and maybe you will too!Note that I received an advanced copy of this book for review in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10105567-andrea", "userReview": "\"Now that I\u2019m a girl, I\u2019m treated like I\u2019m nobody again, to be owned or herded or strung along, so helpless and awful that I must be redeemed or married off because it\u2019s convenient for someone.\"\n I've been looking forward to Walk on Earth a Stranger for so long. And I am happy to say it did not disappoint! Walk on Earth a Stranger is about a girl named Leah Westfall who can sense gold. After her parents are murdered, Leah disguises herself as a boy and decides to head west to find gold and start a new life. This book had me hooked from the first page. I was a little worried about this only because I've never been a huge fan of westerns, but Carson has written a fast-paced historical novel with some paranormal thrown in there that makes for an exciting read. What I liked most about this book though was Leah. \n\"It\u2019s a testament to my fine character that I don\u2019t smash that Bible right into his nose.\"\n Leah is definitely one of the most determined characters I've ever read about. She's not perfect but she's someone you can respect and even look up to. She wants to be seen as an equal, not some damsel in distress. So she decides to disguise herself as a boy because she knows nobody will take her seriously as a woman.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be treated with respect than treated like a lady.\"\nSince this did take place in the 1840s, the majority of the story is Leah and her friends trying to survive the trek to California. I mean, there were no planes so... it took a while to get there. They encounter thieves, buffalo's, measles, you name it. They meet all types of people along the way, and Carson manages to portray most of them in a realistic way.The point is this book has such an amazing concept, lots of action, a slow-burn romance, and a kick-ass heroine that all I have to say is trust me when I say you should read this.Also, that cover is amazing."}, {"userName": "Drew", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22104588-drew", "userReview": "\u201cWhy do you spend so much time out there?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I settle my head down onto the saddlebag. \u201cMaybe because it\u2019s the only time I don\u2019t have to lie to anyone.\u201d\nThis book follows Lee's journey to California during the gold rush. It's full of escapades like cows falling into rivers, frightening tales of Indians, children going missing, and Lee meeting and befriending new people.Lee was an awesome, tough, well-rounded heroine. She flees her home and has to disguise herself as a boy so she can get a job on the trail. Lee's parents were murdered and she is heartbroken by their deaths, but she doesn't fall apart from grief as she has her friends, Jeff and Therese, to console her.\n\u201cMy mama and daddy are a constant ache in me, even months later.\u201d\nAlthough Lee has a magical power to sense gold, don't expect an action-packed story full of suspense and chase scenes.The pacing was much slower than most YA novels, but surprisingly, I really liked the quiet plot that built a solid foundation for the characters and setting. This isn't an action-packed fantasy, but a story of so many people following the wagon train on a long, exhausting journey in search of gold.The writing was absolutely gorgeous. Rae Carson's stunning scenes and lovely words made it so easy to imagine the western setting and understand the characters' struggles and hardships.\n\u201cThe world has exploded with wildflowers\u2014black-eyed Susans and blue chicory and yellow mustard\u2014and the sun lounges heavy in the sky, casting the world in a golden haze.\u201d\nThis was a slower, different kind of book than you'd normally find in the young adult genre, but I thought its unique tone was wonderful."}], "description": "Gold is in my blood, in my breath, even in the flecks in my eyes.Lee Westfall has a strong, loving family.
