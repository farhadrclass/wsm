Hard. I may be 30 years younger than the late author, but much of what McLaurin writes about still is deeply true about the little rural and small town places across the South, and his observation about feeling so lost in a world where his children don't talk like he does, with the South changing so quickly, is even more true now than it was twenty years ago when he wrote this book. It's not a nostalgic book, as nostalgia has simplistic, reactionary connotations. Rather, this is a book that faces up to the realities of a world that is always, necessarily, in flux, but how the only way to deal with this is to draw on what made us, facing its horrors, beauties, and messy ambiguities. Or maybe that's how Southerners have to face the world. Hell, it's how I have to face it. I read this and kept sitting and talking with myself, trying to figure out how I got from a world not totally unlike the one McLaurin describes, and ended where I am now. And how that world continues to recreate how I live. My wife has stuff she wants me to get done today. Which is good, because otherwise, I'd be about 4 fingers deep into a bottle of bourbon and thinking about the past, the beautiful, painful past with its long-leaf pines and jet-black dirt, of home.Blue-staters who want to understand red-staters, who want to look at us as more than a bunch of unsophisticated hicks, start here. Yankees who've moved to the South and want to know why it is we get ill that you're changing so much, want to know what it is we feel like we're losing, start here (and then move onto McLaurin's comic masterpiece novel, Woodrow's Trumpet)."}, {"userName": "Carl Weaver", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4716270-carl-weaver", "userReview": "Easily one of the best books I have ever read about growing up and our continual evolution as we walk life's paths. McLaurin tells a tale that is honest, if sometimes unattractive and unflattering about his own life, but the book's strength lies in exactly that - its honesty. He does not sugar-coat anything but tells stories we can all relate to on some level, showing the beauty and horror of life. He tells it all and admits everything, neither reveling in triumph nor wallowing in self-pity.Everyone should read this book. It is engaging enough for adults but written in such a way that children could also appreciate it. Far from a children's book, it weaves together tales from various parts of life, and emphasizes that the whole of our lives is a tapestry of stories that connect points in time, help us relate to each other, and make sense out of the past.Tim McLaurin's departure from our lives is a sadness we all will feel when we read this book and know the richness we now miss, the strong voice whose words live on, if only from the printed page."}, {"userName": "John Hart", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30969681-john-hart", "userReview": "This is probably my favorite book of all time, definitely my favorite McLaurin book. To give people an open and honest look into your life is a remarkable and sometimes difficult thing to do. I had the pleasure of meeting Tim Mclaurin at a couple of book readings before he died. He was such an interesting guy, and we shared some common experiences, such as both having served in the Marines and close to the same age. All his books are tremendous. He left us way too soon."}, {"userName": "Stella Fouts", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40837-stella-fouts", "userReview": "If you grew up living in a four-square house (two bedrooms, a kitchen and a living room) with no indoor plumbing, you will relate to this story. Heck, if you lived way better than Tim McLaurin and his four siblings did growing up in North Carolina, you'll STILL be able to relate to this story. Tim is brutally honest about things he did as a child that aren't admirable - one incident in particular will shock you (I don't need to tell you which scene it is--you'll know immediately once you've read it.) And Tim's childhood - as a snake handler, a tobacco leaf picker, a dreamer - is very interesting, to say the least. His descriptions of a cockfight AND a pit bull fight put you right there as each unfolds. (You don't have to like what the characters are doing to appreciate the author's description of a particular event. It is what it is.) I'm disappointed that I've just now discovered Tim McLaurin only to learn that he died in 2002 at the young age of 48. If only he'd had time to write more - he was a master at telling stories.http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/reme..."}, {"userName": "David Ward", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/329996-david-ward", "userReview": "Keeper of the Moon: A Southern Boyhood by Tim McLaurin (Anchor Books 1991) (Biography). Tim McLaurin's biography of Southern boyhood spoke directly to me. Like the author, this reader grew up in the South and came of high-school age in the early to mid-1970's. McLaurin grew up in the North Carolina Piedmont; his reminiscences of chicken fighting, coon hunting, visiting a first prostitute, catching cancer, and coming to terms with the Croatan Indians are all parts of Dixie that most Southerners of a certain age will understand (and may have experienced). I very much enjoyed the author's style and his stories. My rating: 7.25/10, finished 8/4/16. I purchased my (PB) copy which was in very good shape from McKay's Books on 7/25/16 for $1.50.

Its not so much the fact that he was a local author, but that the time & place of his upbringing is evident in so much of his phrasing. I guess its a 'Southern' thing.
