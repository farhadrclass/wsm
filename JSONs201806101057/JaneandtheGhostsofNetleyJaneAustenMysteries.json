Storia intrigante, ricca di dettagli e approfondimenti, suspance e colpi di scena. Non annoia mai, tiene sempre viva la curiosit\u00e0. Uno spaccato storico dell'epoca impeccabile. Penso che Stephanie Barron abbia creato dei piccoli capolavori. Consigliato per chi ama Jane Austen, poich\u00e9 offre molti dettagli sulla sua vita arricchendola della dote di scaltra investigatrice, ma \u00e8 sicuramente una lettura adatta anche per chi \u00e8 semplicemente affascinato dalla magnifica epoca storica in cui la scrittrice visse (fine 1700-inizi 1800)."}, {"userName": "Laurel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1406509-laurel", "userReview": "It is the fall of 1808 and Jane Austen and her family are in mourning after the sudden death of Elizabeth \u201cLizzy\u201d Austen, the elegant and enchanting thirty-five year old wife of Jane\u2019s elder brother Edward and mother of eleven children. To entertain the two eldest boys while they stay with her in Southampton, Jane takes them rowing up the Solent to the ruins of Netley Abbey, a Cistercian monastery long abandoned and now a picturesque ruin worthy of a Radcliffe Gothic novel, resplendent with tales of ghosts haunting its halls. Startled by a dark figure lurking in the shadows, Jane is called to immediately attend her friend aboard a Royal Naval vessel anchored nearby. It is an unusual request, but she cannot refuse any summons by the Gentleman Rogue. Yes, Gentle Readers. Lord Harold Trowbridge has re-appeared after two years without any communication with our dear Jane.Her heart is aflutter and her keen mind piqued when he requests her assistance to spy upon a local lady of interest; the beautiful and cunning widow of a French merchant, Sophia Challoner, a Diamond of the First Water who trifled with Lord Trowbridge\u2019s heart, flattering and deceiving him into revealing state secrets to pass along to aid Bonaparte\u2019s cause. Having just returned from Portugal, she now resides at Netley Lodge adjacent to the ruined abbey. Jane\u2019s assignment is to keep \u201ca weathered eye on the activity of that house\u201d and discover how Sophia dispatches her intelligence to France. To aid the investigation, Jane will befriend the dubious and dangerous lady while arson and murders a plenty puzzle the plot, \u2013 and Lord Harold and Jane take center stage in the investigation and secretly in each others hearts.The seventh mystery in the series, Barron really hits her stride with more fluid language from Jane\u2019s perspective, the intricate historical details of the Peninsular War against France, and the political intrigue that fuels spies and generates murder. Having so much dialogue devoted to Lord Harold and Jane is a delight, but readers will be disarmed by the concluding pages and dispatched into a crying jag that could take a week to recover from. This is a three hankie weepie that will startle and sear your soul. Great writing makes it all compelling and tragic. *sigh* Seven is definitely not a lucky number for Jane and the Gentleman Rogue. I loved every word, and hated the ending all the same. *sniff*Laurel Ann, Austenprose"}, {"userName": "Jenna", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2765710-jenna", "userReview": "Have ever read a book whose hero or heroine is someone you found yourself relating to on a deep level? Maybe you saw some of yourself in that person; or someone who you wished you were. Maybe that person represented a choice you made -- or one you wish you had or had not made. Regardless, it was a character whose shoes and dress you easily slipped into to live vicariously through their journeys with them. I've long loved and admired Jane Austen and Stephanie Barron's series has afforded me with an opportunity to see things through Jane's eyes. (Even if it is fiction.) And when Jane met Lord Harold Trowbridge, I met Lord Harold Trowbridge. And as Jane fell in love with him, I fell in love with him. In Jane and the Ghosts of Netley we both lose the man we secretly loved -- and who secretly loved us, back.A short way into this book, I told someone that this was the first of Barron's Jane Austen mysteries that really grabbed me right from page one. I typically find myself slowly easing into the text, like stepping into a cold pool. This time, I was fully immersed from the start. From Jane being summoned to meet Lord Harold aboard a ship to her quick pain in finding that he needed help with \"a conquest,\" to the slow unraveling of Lord Harold's true intentions and feelings for Jane and, finally, the agony of having to say goodbye just as love was requited and admitted. It isn't fair. And I do feel a bit heartbroken. I quickly ran out to the library for the next book in the series, Jane and His Lordship's Legacy, but, I have to admit, the gild is off the rose for me a little bit. I'm definitely going to keep reading, but I will do it in Jane Austen fashion: with a heavy heart."}, {"userName": "Jeanne Adamek", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27905637-jeanne-adamek", "userReview": "3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1037969-jen", "userReview": "I loved this book. You have to suspend disbelief to read this series (Jane Austen solves crimes that just happen to happen to people around her, almost all of which somehow involve Lord Harold Trowbridge, whom she slowly falls in love with over the course of the first seven books), but I love the characters. I also love how well-researched the time period is. It's like stepping into England of the early 19th century. I was unsure how I felt about where the Lord Harold/Jane romance was going (Jane Austen in love? How dare she mess with a cultural icon!), but I think it was handled well, although they could have kissed and that would have been okay with me. When Lord Harold died at the end of this book, telling Jane he should have married her years ago and making her promise she would continue to write, I was sobbing and had to pick up the next in the series immediately.

Absolute favorite so far, the ending regarding Jane and Lord Harold, I actually gasped out loud in shock, it was that unexpected. Whew, now that that's out of the way, this volume walked the fine line, for me, of the reader being able to solve the mystery but still be kept guessing as to certain particulars. This, I believe, it was makes a mystery engaging in the first place, and this installment in the series had it in spades. The new faces we met, Sophia, Mr. Ord, were sympathetic, interesting, dynamic characters, and I appreciated this feeling more like part of the series by so many recurring characters from last book, given as they remained in Southampton. I could take or leave the whole French spies/Peninsular War/Catholics in England bit, but that is always the case, the characters are more compelling than the backdrop in which they are set. This takes a turn towards more direct information relating to extant historical details on Jane's life - where she is in her writing career, the missive from Ned regarding Chawton - and I'm not sure how I feel about that. It makes one feel that the protagonist is decidedly Jane Austen, which in the previous books had been someone lacking and I tended to think of the character named as Jane Austen merely as a Regency woman of similar circumstances. In delineating these factual details, the author opens herself up to more scrutiny, is this woman really Jane?, that sort of thing, and so my reading was tinged more with the color of doubting whether actual!Jane would do as fictional!Jane does."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1449414-teresa", "userReview": "Found this book slow going at first.

Jane, rattristata dalla morte della cognata Elizabeth, cerca di tenere occupati i due nipoti maggiori visitando le rovine di un'antica abbazia.

Jane's curiosity is awakened by the arrival of someone at Netley Abbey. Rumor has it that the Abbey is haunted by ghosts of the monks who used to live there. Jane doesn't quite believe it but it's fun to imagine just the same. She is surprised by a visit from The Gentleman Rogue himself. Lord Harold wants Jane to spy on the beautiful but dangerous widow Sophia Challoner who resides at the Abbey. Lord Harold believes that Mrs. Challoner, whom he had known intimately in Portugal, is a French spy. An unlucky accident brings Jane right into Mrs. Challoner's home and her confidence. The widow has nothing good to say about Lord Harold and Jane begins to question whose opinion is correct. The arrival of a stranger from Baltimore arouses Jane's suspicion but she becomes confused again when Maria Fitzherbert, a cast off royal mistress, joins the house party. While Jane socializes with Mrs. Challoner and friends, she dreams of living the life of a tonnish lady by Lord Harold's side. Another mysterious stranger arrives at the Abbey and Mrs. Challoner's maid accuses her employer of witchcraft. With the help of His Lordship's valet, Jane attempts a more in-depth investigation involving hysterical maids, secret tunnels and a stranger called Mon Singeur. Just as Jane thinks she has it all worked out, something goes horribly wrong and one dear to her becomes the victim. This is not the best mystery of the series.It's not too difficult to figure out who Mon Singeur is and what the connection between Mrs. Challoner's houseguests is. I also suspected the villain and I think that Lord Harold was stupid and should have figured it out. This story is darker and more sad than some of the others. Jane spends almost the whole book mooning over Lord Harold and I find it quite out of character for her."}, {"userName": "Jan Peregrine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27549056-jan-peregrine", "userReview": "I've been savoring this mystery series for many months as I quickly go through it. Having started with the latest, the thirteenth, I eagerly sought the first and up to this seventh in the series. I wasn't impressed with the sixth one, but this one kept me turning pages until the sad, but well-thought-out ending. I really don't know how I could be satisfied with Jane's romantic books now that I've read these novels based on her own journals.There are no ghosts in the book, but it's decidedly the dark setting for them! The story takes place in Southhampton in early 1800s England and Jane's \"Rogue Gentleman\" is asking her to spy on a suspected French spy for the safety of England. Barron's writing is charming and thrilling as we hear Jane's perspective on wanting to help him who she secretly loves and suspecting that he's in love with the spy who spurned him.You could read the books out of order or by themselves and still enjoy them, but you won't appreciate the references to past events as well. Barron includes footnotes fairly often and an Author's Note too.

Although the story represents an important chapter in the life of Jane Austen as re-imagined by Stephanie Barron, sadly, the story itself lacks substance. There is less mystery to this one--despite the high body count--and more action/espionage thriller. It strains my willing suspension of disbelief a little to picture Jane Austen creeping along a secret tunnel at night alone with a man. In fact, a lot of things Jane did in this book strained by willing suspension of disbelief. Although Jane and Lord Harold joke about her being \"ruined\" by him...yeah, she had been, pretty much. Why is Jane's mom the only one who has a problem with this? Aside from the Shocking Twist, the ending falls flat. Although the JA mysteries typically do rush to a conclusion, here the whodunnit is solved entirely by stumbling across the murderer. The reader may figure it out, but Jane Austen and Lord Harold do not. Many loose ends are left dangling--most of which are not picked up in the following book, Jane and His Lordship's Legacy."}, {"userName": "Miriam", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51492313-miriam", "userReview": "Another Jane Austen mystery, and in my opinion one of the better ones, if not quite reaching the heights of the Wandering Eye. It was pleasant to see Jane still in the same setting of the previous book, and to witness consequences from that book, such as Jane's acquaintance with Mr. Hawkins and established dislike of the magistrate of Southampton. Additionally, the new characters were charming, especially the captivating Sophia Challoner, and I enjoyed the real-life aspect of Mrs. Fitzherbert appearing as a character. I felt that the romance aspect with Lord Harold was suddenly laid on a little thick, when it had been much more subtle before, but at least there were those indications in the previous books, even if it finally came to the forefront here. The mystery was a bit less convoluted than usual, and Mrs. Challoner was quite obvious as a red herring (which in turn made Lord Harold look quite stupid), but it was still a solid story.Overall a good entry into the series, I will certainly continue reading about Jane."}, {"userName": "Darcy Stewart", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1852193-darcy-stewart", "userReview": "I thought this book was going to be a good one, but it wasn't.

Seriously if you have to put footnotes at the bottom of the page leave that stuff out. I'm not going to waste time reading that. It's not even a part of the book, and even takes away from a book. Footnotes really piss me off, because you have stop reading and find what this and that means which is practically on every page. I don't want to read a historical novel.
