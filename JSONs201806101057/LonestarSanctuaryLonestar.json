He figured that if anything was going to make him go into catatonic sleep, this book would do it, so he began to read. To his surprise (and mine), he couldn't put it down, and went to bed early each night for the next two days so he could read in bed. It was the first book he has finished in three years.

Ms. Coble writes great romantic suspense, and what's even better - she writes great Christian romantic suspense, without beating you over the head with the Christian references. Allie Siders has dealt with too much death over the last few years. First, her husband was killed in the war in Afghanistan, and her in-laws are determined to gain custody of her daughter. Then her parents died in a tragic plane accident, and her sister was killed during a burglary. As if that wasn't enough, her five-year-old daughter, Betsy, has stopped talking. Allie has made a life barrel racing on the rodeo circuit. But trouble has a way of finding her, and when a man claiming to be behind her sister's death tries to attack her in her trailer, she decides that it would be in the best interest of both herself and her daughter to leave the rodeo and travel to the Bluebird Ranch. The ranch is owned by Elijah, a man who holds more importance to Allie than anyone knows, and who also runs a program that uses horses and ranch work to help troubled kids. But even more importantly, the ranch is run by foreman Rick Bailey - the man who was her husband's closest friend during the war, and who is harboring secrets of his own. When it becomes clear that someone is determined to make Allie suffer for a sin she doesn't even know she committed, both Rick and Allie will have to put their differences aside to keep Betsy safe. Let me just say, this book is a real page-turner. The suspense is perfectly plotted, and although I wasn't personally fond of people close to Allie dropping like flies, it worked with the story. And as I mentioned, the Christian/inspirational references were well done, without being over done. The ending was realistic, the dialogue throughout the story was perfectly believable, and I actually enjoyed getting to know these characters. LONESTAR SANCTUARY is a winner!"}, {"userName": "Hope", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13246091-hope", "userReview": "The sad thing is that this didn\u2019t have to be a disaster. Ms. Coble can write. There are no glaringly bad sentences and the characters are likable. But not one of her editors ever told her that \u201cless is more.\u201d This story is multi-layered in a very bad way.First, the heroine is running from a mad killer. He killed her entire family and her best friend and is now after her and her daughter. She\u2019s a widow whose traumatized child hasn\u2019t spoken in a year. Husband was a war veteran, killed (sort of) by his best friend. Widow runs to refuge indicated by husband before his death. Husband\u2019s BF is there and marries her to protect her from mad killer and former husband\u2019s parents who belong to a Christian cult and who take in foster children for the money. BF\u2019s mother whipped the tar out of him as a kid. He also has a long-lost brother he is trying to track down. And he is a former alcoholic. Widow\u2019s mom lied to her about her upbringing. Ranch owner is her long-lost grandfather. He dies mysteriously. Widow has rare eye disease. And the \u201csanctuary\u201d is a ranch that takes in wounded horses and at-risk kids. Sweet pastor. Check. Corrupt sheriff. Check. Ex husband\u2019s BF saves the day and is forgiven all. Check.Seriously? One third of these story lines would have been enough to keep the story going. But all of them together were a hot mess. The motive for the multiple murders was hardly believable. I ask myself why publishers print this stuff and then I see all the five star ratings and realize that people really don't mind the flimsy plots as long as some Christianity and romance are thrown in."}, {"userName": "Sarita", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37168935-sarita", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book, even though I thought I\u2019m in for more of a thrilling ride than what I ended up in, this story still kept me turning pages.The moment the one character was introduced, I knew it was the stalker so the reveal wasn\u2019t surprising.

But with an unknown stalker out for revenge, all Allie can think about is the safety that awaits them at the peaceful and remote Bluebird Ranch. Nestled deep in the Texas Hill country,the ranch is not only a sanctuary for abused horses but troubled youths. Here is where Allie is determined that her young daughter can heal as well as give them both a safe haven. Ranch owner Elijah DeAngelo who is compassionate and kind, eagerly welcomes the two. But Rick Bailey the handsome foreman, hasn't decided to let his guard down...yet. As promises made long ago soon force these two together they now have to work together to save all that they hold dear. And along the way they will discover the remarkable power of love and how to heal and let the past go and to allow new beginnings to grow. This was a really good story of building a relationship between two strangers, learning to trust,and letting love grow between two remarkable characters. A great mystery as well thrown in as to who this stalker was and had me guessing to the end, as well as a few surprise secrets that unfold from the past.

The thing that impressed me the most was the romance was not based mostly on physical attraction. I'm not sure that God would allow Christians to be forced into the kind of relationship they had, but given the circumstance, the author handled it very well. At first they loved more from choice than from emotion, and worked to make their relationship better. They admired and then loved each other because of strength of character, not because of the color of their eyes or sexual attraction."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2227593-katie", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. I've read others by colleen coble, and some I've enjoyed reading more than others - she always combines a little romance with a lot of suspense, and in this book she does that again - keeps you guessing as to who is behind everything. The only thing I thought was cheesy was just how conveniently she had the characters all connected - it just so happened that the main character Allie was related to the guy who owned the ranch that employed the guy who her dead husband told her to contact in case something happened.... AND that ranch also was for kids with emotional problems, which was perfect for her daughter who hadn't spoken in a year after witnessing the death of her grandparents. If that weren't enough the ranch is also connected to the person who is harrassing Allie as well.

To begin, I was unprepared for the fact that this would be a marriage of convenience story. Not that I don't like that trope, but I typically have to be in the mood for it. The rest of the story just felt flat. A little disjointed. The story didn't flow. And as the threats to Allie hit closer and closer to home, I started to get irritated that they didn't look closer to home for the bad guy. Seriously, Rick saddles the horse, and then by the time Allie gets on it, someone has compromised it. Who would have had access? Wouldn't they have noticed a stranger lurking about? Wouldn't that have been a clue that it was someone on the inside? It had potential as a story line, but I just didn't enjoy the execution.

But this time,I did make it a point to get it done very soon,if not sooner.And so,here I am.Unlike the previous hard bound I got from the same publishers,frankly speaking this paperback really did not live upto the expectations the first novel mustered upon me by its quality.But everything can\u2019t and should not be always compared with other equals,and this one has got its own positives,maybe some of which the previous one lacked in some aspects.So,over and all,you don\u2019t loose.\u2018Lonestar Secrets\u2019 speaks about the rather coming-back-to-life life of a girl(or rather a woman) who has seen life from different perspectives,be it the jeery low or be it the glorious top by virtue of her own dignified approach to life,she has gone through all of it.And in that way she is lucky enough to differentiate between right and wrong,black and white,and love and hate.Love gave her the jeer of her life,love forced her to loose all trust on \u2018trustworthiness\u2019,love forced her down the dungeon of darkness and lifenessness.And that too with none there by her side,her parents being dead on way to their journey of \u2018quick-bucks\u2019.Shannon Astor,the protagonist then survived with her own implications of life,pulled herself throughout high school,and after that joined her very close-to-heart vet discipline,for which she can even give up life\u2019s niceties.And this determination with whoch she took up her life of betterment shoved her way up to more brightnesses.In themeanwhile some dramatisms took palce in her life regarding her falling for a shiny-buckled-heartless-cowboy,carrying his twin child,and then a hospital fiasco during her labor which turned out to be a life-changer for her to betterment.And this is the point from where she started to see the light of life,maybe the twin children were god-send to her in that way.And more drama follows,her making up to her babychild-switching,her meeting her childhood crush whom she got forced to marry by circumstances,and then for the rest of the drama was rather in her own side.She won in every aspects of life.She own every hearts and every trusts.Which in turn brings up the woman in her ina big way.Author Colleen Coble has got in her sleeves two more before this one in this series,including \u2018Lonestar Sanctuary\u2019 but maybe this is one of her best works,and who can say we are going to get better of her very soon,if not sooner!Visit my blog M.A.D here for more reviews: http://unpublisho.wordpress.com/2009/..."}, {"userName": "Jeanne", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43533-jeanne", "userReview": "Coble writes a romantic-thriller with a Christian perspective. You wouldn't think it was Christian to begin with and never gets preachy, so I thought it was well done. The thriller part not so much. I guess the difference between \"thriller\" and \"mystery\" is what's catching me up. I want a chance to figure it out, but the story gives no clues (I still knew who it was pretty early on). I guess that's supposed to help with the tension (\"Who could possibly want to harm me?!?\"), but instead it felt almost unrealistic. A stalker is after a woman barrel-racer. He blames her for ruining his life, but she has no idea who he is. He's killed her parents and her sister and is threatening to take away everything she loves. Her daughter witnessed her parents' plane crash and stopped speaking. To get her daughter help, and to hide from the stalker, she heads to Bluebird Ranch, a sanctuary for troubled kids she heard about from one of the ranch hands. However, she has some connections to the ranch. Her mother told her something about the man who owns it and her husband served in the military with the manager. Already my suspension of disbelief is stretched. It's a little too \"small world\" for me.To keep her daughter out of a custody battle with her in-laws, she marries the range manager and he adopts the girl. He'd promised the woman's husband to look after his family. The manager is guilt-ridden over the part he played in the husband's death and struggling with his personal demons. The woman doesn't want anything to replace her husband's memory with her or her daughter.Oh, right, and someone's trying to kill her. Other than the manager's talking to law-enforcement, border patrol, and his friend in \"intelligence\", there's no real search to identify the guy. They make no moves to protect the ranch or the family other than locking the doors. Attempt after attempt is made on their lives and they just go about their business with a little hand-wringing.But, if you can ignore all that, it's still an entertaining story, which is why it's getting three stars instead of less."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/251943-kelly", "userReview": "I ended up being a disappointed with this book. Based on the synopsis, I was expecting a tense, fast-paced thriller with danger around every corner. While the main character does face danger, I was left waiting for something horrific that never came. Beyond that, I'm never thrilled when religious undertones pop up in a book unexpectedly. I really have an issue with someone saying that xx happened because it was God's will. That's my issue, though, and while I probably wouldn't have downloaded the book in the first place if I knew it had religious leanings I can't blame the book itself for a personality quirk that's entirely mine.Like I said, I ended up disappointed with the book. I thought Allie was an uneven character. She goes from being fiercely protective of her daughter and refusing to let her out of her sight to leaving her with the group home kids at the drop of a hat. And when she leaves her with the vet/pastor's family? Did she even tell the poor kid she was leaving. If I were an emotionally traumatized 5 year old and my mom left me with virtual strangers without letting me know what was going on I would have imploded with fear. What can I say? That really bothered me.I didn't hate the book but I definitely didn't love it. It was just okay. But, as I said before, surprise religious undertones aren't my cup of tea. I tried to read the book without letting it affect me but I don't care for religion in my readings. I'm not bashing on anyone who does like that sort of thing because I'm sure that reading about sexy werewolf menages aren't what plenty of other people look at when they're looking for a good time.I just don't think I'm the target audience here.-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal"}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4421671-jane", "userReview": "I could not put this book down at all.

The author brings together some of my favorite elements for a great story; suspense, mystery, romance, the tough-but-tortured-soul-cowboy with a troubled past, a bonafide Rodeo Queen, and so much more! Having recently lost her parents and her husband in separate incidents, Allie's had more than her fair share of grief. Now she's on the run from a deadly stalker...with her five-year-old traumatized daughter...seeking guidance and safety on the Bluebird Ranch. Rick Bailey, the ranch foreman, isn't sure what to think of Allie. Not one to easily trust strangers (even the pretty ones) he thinks she's out to take advantage of Elijah's good nature. It took me a little while to warm up to Rick, but as his story came out I grew to understand why he was a bit of a jerk in the beginning. Overall the story is a fast read (maybe a little rushed at times), easy to follow, and perhaps a bit predictable, but enjoyable nonetheless. I would've loved the book to be a little longer with more attention spent on character development and interpersonal relationships, especially the relationships between the young teens and the adults. I just didn't feel as much emotion from the characters as I normally do from a Colleen Coble book, which is why my rating is four stars. It's still a very good book.If you are a romantic suspense fan or enjoy western romance, definitely check out Lonestar Sanctuary!

Not only is she dealing with significant loses in her life, but she also has to deal with a judgmental ranch hand, Rick, who is also an old friend of her late husband.
