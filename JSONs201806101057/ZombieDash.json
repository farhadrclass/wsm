Imagine if someone really wanted to feed off their flesh right abut now? It almost made me drool. Sports bras left flesh exposed easily within reach like an appetizer tray. Runners' legs had calf muscles chapped like chicken drumsticks. The massive crowd huddled together was just one big buffet."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/763271-nancy", "userReview": "Posted at Shelf InflictedThis was just the right story to jump-start my workout on the stationary bike. Even though it was about 90 degrees outside and the chugging air-conditioner didn\u2019t seem to be cool enough, my legs were pumping in record time in solidarity with the unnamed narrator, and her friend, Becca, trying to escape the volunteer zombies at the company-sponsored Zombie Dash 10K. It\u2019s all fun and games, with the volunteers using little flags to represent their kills and the runners giggling and screaming in mock horror. It all changes when an evil clown zombie gets in on the action.I don\u2019t want to say any more and spoil the fun for anyone. This story is fast-paced, suspenseful and terrifying. Never trust zombies, even if they look like Bill Clinton or are dressed like cute babies. Though this story was well-written, it is rife with awkward sentences and misspellings, which sometimes pulled me out of the story. In a self-published work, this is something I can tolerate, but I do hope the author will consider finding a good editor for future stories.

Come find out. For one night and one night only. YOU can not only test your running skills, but your will to live! This Zombie Dash 10k event will get your blood pumping and feet running. Run, scream, and fight your way through the trails and hordes of zombies on Halloween night! Ha-ha\u2026.Bloody brilliant idea! This story is pure horror fun.Zombie Dash by Mark Matthews is the story of how a race through the dark shadows of the night can turn into a melee of zombie gore and fear. Zombie babies, zombie brides, zombie clowns\u2014Oh, my! A flag football type event organized with runners and volunteer zombies ready to bite, grab, and terrify all the way to the finish line\u2014if you make it that far. For these runners, this dash may be their last. \u201cThis was no Romero staggering zombie, this wasn\u2019t a slow motion man with wooden legs and no dexterity wearing an old faded suit he\u2019d been buried in years ago. Nope. This was a super-sonic zombie made of new drugs and Danny Boyle style, so I ran. I sprinted. I hauled ass running on the tips of my shoes like a 5 year old child after the ice cream man.\u201dThis little gem holds one of my all-time favorite heebie-jeebies in horror\u2014the real terror hidden under the costumes and fake blood scenario. Real jumps and screams in the pretend set up. The idea that something real and sinister is happening right there in front of everyone makes me *shiver*. Thinking the panic and blood is all for show, the audience or crowd allows the horror to happen without a word, worry or second glance. People walk on by. Screams for help ignored. Mr. Matthews captures that no-help-is-coming confusion, shock, and fear on the page. Truly chilling!I\u2019m not sure how I stumbled across this little ditty, but I am so glad I did. A FREE short story filled with gurgles, guts, and screams! Made my horror loving heart happy."}, {"userName": "Reymart Dinglasa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8177078-reymart-dinglasa", "userReview": "Hash-tag...Voom!Ever since, I'm a fan of Apocalyptic Novels, Zombie ones, Horror themes, and plainly Scary stuff.And all I can say right now that this piece, obviously known as a short-story, could be a whole book of our Mark Matthews wanted it to.It's an easy ride for a short story and from the start it already \"activates\" your adrenaline too. This can even be a \"goosebumps\" kind of thing, and I am honestly intrigued about Dr. Brogstorm's mystery. This could be a good Y.A. Zombie Novella if possible. Mark could spare another few pages to make this one h*ll of a longer story.I'm intrigued, STILL, and the tone of the narrative is very nicely constructed, I felt it. It has a funny tone too, possible for a longer version.\nIf there is another modern CREEPSHOW or a TREAK 'r TREAT film, I want this to be in either one of them.\nBut Just Remember One Thing If You're In The Middle Of It...JUST..."}, {"userName": "Gregor Xane", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2165551-gregor-xane", "userReview": "First off, I'm not a zombie guy. I picked this one up because it was free, and I wanted to see if the author would avoid the most obvious thing in the world he could possibly do: include real zombies in an event featuring fake zombies. Sadly, he went down the obvious path, and this was a rather large strike against this piece for me.The story had a cluster of glaring problems that a proofreader could have fixed. 'Feel' is used when 'fell' is meant. People 'flayed' instead of 'flailed.' That sort of thing. Now this wasn't a consistent problem throughout (not that I noticed, anyway). It kind of seemed like there was a chunk of errors when things really started getting scary. Maybe the proofreader had to look away?The storytelling on display here isn't bad and the typos aren't of the 'so maddening that you need to pull out your hair' variety. So, I certainly wouldn't try to dissuade zombie guys and gals from reading this.

I have never read a Zombie book in my life and always said I never would, so when I saw this was free in the iBooks store I had to get it. I was curious to see what spin on the zombies Mark would add, so I plunged into this short story wondering if I was a fool for breaking my \"no zombies every\" rule.This was a really good short story. Runners are geared up for running in what is meant to be a fun \"Zombie Dash\" race, where \"zombies\" grab a flag from them and they lose minutes off their final time if \"caught\", the zombies are cleverly dressed up people, it's all fun and games. \nThere are ways to survive the zombie apocalypse, and one is to make sure it is others who get eaten.\nUNTIL...it all goes horribly, tragically, horrifically wrong.Suddenly the race is not so much fun and for a few of the competitors this race takes a very sinister twist. \nThis was a super-sonic zombie made of new drugs and Danny Boyle style, so I ran. I sprinted. I hauled ass running on the tips of my shoes like a 5 year old child after the ice cream man.\nIt's 24 pages long, a short but worthy read for those that like a zombie theme.

Well, I turned on my phone, found my kindle app and picked a short story. Not that it was particularly effective against nightmares, I dreamt of zombies after I had finished and drifted off again.This is a really short story about a 10 km race through hordes of people dressed up as zombies. They remove flags from the runner's belts, which means that time is added when they come to the finish line. It's incredibly obvious what will happen. It's fairly entertaining, but the main character is dumber than a rock - who would ever wish for a zombie apocalypse as shown in movies and on TV? Be careful what you wish for anyway.Despite the fact that I had woken up from a zombie nightmare - or because of that fact, my own imagniation is a terrifying beast - this was a yawner.

Losing a flag costs time to be added at the finish. At first it is all fun with giggling zombies and mock screams of horror until the big clown zombie targets Becca with real menace and drags her away...I have always wanted to get involved in these zombie races as it looks like a really good laugh-I'd have to be a shambling zombie though as I can't run for a bus, never mind 10k! So this story idea appealed to me when I saw it. You can imagine the atmosphere...runners pretending to scream and yell with fear, volunteers yelling 'braiiiinnnsss!' and trying to grab them without cracking up laughing and everyone having a great time. Nobody is going to notice real screams when one zombie is trying to attack a girl for real and everyone ignores her friend yelling for help and chasing them into the dark woods...I liked this story. It had the fun of the race and then the tension and the menace of the zombie clown. I mean, clowns are bad enough but zombie clowns really are a twisted invention! I liked the plot twists that kept on coming, starting with the identity of the attacker and his reasons for doing it. You do have hints about this in the early part of the book so if you're paying attention you'll be expecting this but it is still fun waiting for the reveal. I really enjoyed what came next...call it the twist after the reveal! It would spoil the story if I tell you but it was a good ending.I could see a follow up story, beginning where this left off and if it comes I would certainly read it.

The reading level felt very low and overall like a children's book. I'm stuck on whether to place this book with 2 stars or 3. The plot seems very much like a jest. Fake zombies participating in a race to grab flags? That didn't make sense to me. The references to Thriller and Zombie titles was cringe worthy. I suppose only the end saves it as in all short stories they tend to have a surprising twist.
