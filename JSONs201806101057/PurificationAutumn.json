Mankind is being cleansed from the face of the planet. Purification has begun.\"Book 3 of David Moody's Autumn series comes to a well put together ending in this book Autumn: Purification. This is the final book of the main storyline even though there are two additional books in the Autumn world. The best aspect to this series is the consistency from one book to the next. This is not your everyday meat grinder zombie story where the heroes are all killing machines. This series main plot revolves around survival and coming to grips with loss. Loss of loved ones, of life's achievements, and of course loss of hope.Michael, Emma, Cooper, Jack, Kelly, and Steven are all back in this final installment. The survivors from book two go through more trials and tribulations in their pursuit to try and find somewhere that they can be safe. A place where they can at least survive the new horrors of the world. They have all come to accept that they must outlast the decaying undead. Moody paints a bleak picture in this series and it is very easy to identify with this group of likable characters. Moody's writing in this book is more polished, more descriptive, and down right just better written. He adds a great deal of feeling and emotion to this book with descriptive prose and also through implications of the unsaid as well. A good example of both is the following action scene:\"Ellis didn\u2019t have time to think or speak, instead he concentrated on letting bullet after bullet fly into the rotting crowd. An unexpected arc of flame burnt through the air just ahead of him, illuminating the full horror of the scene for a few heart-stopping seconds. The twisted, grotesque faces of hundreds of corpses were suddenly exposed and Ellis found himself staring at them in disgust and revulsion, praying for the light to fade and the dark to return. The nearest corpses were less than ten metres ahead\"The corpses in this series, the undead, or zombies, are not like Romero's forever copied creepy shufflers. The undead in this series undergo a great number of changes, of which I will not add any spoilers by explaining what they are. These changes however, are mimiced and expressed in that of the survivors. I loved all the hidden truths and the gravity of the situation that our cast is exposed to and which they go through. Moody gives the reader a great deal to think about and to feel as this one comes to its conclusion.The slow building of tension and danger of this book, coupled with the slow changes to the world and to the undead, after such an incredibly fast destruction gave this series an awesome feel. I really enjoyed these three books and am a fan of Moody's writing style and characterizations. To me, this series is a post apocapyltic must read. Great read."}, {"userName": "Jo Anne B", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2617828-jo-anne-b", "userReview": "4.5 stars\"The balance of our world has been changed forever. Mankind is being cleansed from the face of the planet. Purification has begun.\"I read this book right after the second one and enjoyed this one a lot more. This time Michael and Emma were in it from the get go and the book was all about getting to the place that could give them all a future.There are more characters introduced who have some handy skills and knowledge but we still have Michael, Emma, Cooper, Donna, Armitage, and Croft. We learn from the new characters what caused this all to happen in the first place and the bodies keep changing. They are more aggressive and are an increasing threat on the security of the survivors.\u00a0There are more situations in this book compared to the others where the bodies are coming after the surviors, so there was a bit more heart pounding scenarios that made for a great read. We are really vested in several of these characters now and are rooting for them throughout this book. There are some choke up moments in this one as well.Once again, Moody stays true to how the events would play out if this were to really happen. It is very believable and realistic. That is what sets this series by Moody apart from other zombie books and makes these more scary. It is like we are getting a glimpse of what is going to happen to is on the future and it ain't pretty. I thought Moody came up with the perfect ending to this third book as well. He left a lot of questions and makes you wonder and think about it even after you have finished reading it.Highly recommend this series to anyone who likes zombie books or books about human nature in general."}, {"userName": "Alondra", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6130276-alondra", "userReview": "4 out of 5 zombie bitesThis was a solid build-up of \"creep.\" These zombies are changing and surely not for the better; and the humans aren't anything to sneeze at either.

Following on directly from where \u201cAutumn: The City\u201d left off, the reader should already be aware of all the main characters. Bursting with action from the start, the survivors are thrown once again into the dangerous rotting world of the undead, mixing horrific tension with the dark mental anguish that the survivors feel daily.Influenced heavily but Romero\u2019s zombie films, the book takes on many of the ideas and situations tackled in his \u201cDead\u201d series. We meet another set of survivors who have access to a helicopter and a plane. And we finally see the survivors pulling together (well, not all of them) to try and make a future for themselves.Perhaps the best written of the \u2018Autumn\u2019 books, \u2018Purification\u2019 uses many styles and techniques to encapsulate the harrowing experiences that the survivors go through. The book often jumps to an almost diary-like first person view-point for a chapter, to then go back to the standard third-person style. The author spends a large amount of the time submerging the reader into the emotions and mental stress of each character producing some beautiful characterization that draws you into this almost believable scenario.The zombies take on new and interesting changes, which are detailed throughout the book. It\u2019s almost as if they are evolving, which brings a nice twist on the classic zombie genre. The book ends in a hopeful, yet still with a dark and slightly negative tone, that concludes the books nicely. The final book of the series is \u201cAutumn: The Human Condition\u201d, that is a companion book which brings to an end the Autumn saga.\u201cAutumn: Purification\u201d is a truly superb novel that will appeal and indeed please every good fan of the zombie genre. Original, dark, fast-paced and in-depth; the book is a fantastic piece of horror fiction.The novel is released through David Moody's own publishing company 'Infected Books' and runs for a total of 287 pages."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Snow", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5250863-rebecca-snow", "userReview": "Having read David Moody\u2019s original book Autumn online for free a bunch of years back and gotten The City a few months back with a Border\u2019s coupon, I knew I had to pre-order Purification when it popped up as a suggestion for me on Amazon back in March. Mr. Moody\u2019s portrayal of survivors among a billion dead makes for an astounding read. There are always those people you want to shake, or hug, or just leave alone. While reading the books, I couldn\u2019t find a single character I could shrug off and not care whether they lived or died. Of course, there were some I just hoped would die, but I wasn\u2019t apathetic about it.His descriptions of the rancid population made reading the book by lantern light during a hurricane even more fun. I had to close the curtains to makes sure the wandering dead couldn\u2019t see the light flickering in the window. No, I\u2019m not kidding.

I should, perhaps, reconsider how often I go around thinking. I managed to finished Autumn, Autumn: Disintegration and Autumn: Purification and am giving them all the same reviews here just so that I might save another bibliophile the same fate. The Autumn series is slow, two-dimensional, filled with gawd-awful dialogue and generally a chore to read. The fact that I read the full three books is a testament to my own stubbornness and in no way should be seen as an indication that anyone else should read all three.

They met a some more characters in the second book who were running and hiding, and together they ran and hid. Purification (mis-labelled the last in the trilogy) offers little in the way of conclusion either. In fact the content is still composed of running and hiding, rinse and repeat. There is little in the way of character development from the survivors, a clear division exists between runners and fodder. That all said, Purification doesn't set out to be different, it's niche in the genre is to fulfil a bleak zombie-infested Britain and it does just that. Straight-forward and unsurprising Purification is an easy time-filler and stays true to the two previous entries."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17057913-michelle", "userReview": "Another good read.

This had me ever so slightly worried since it would have been incredibly easy for Moody to take the path of least resistance and created a clone of the plot from Romero's Day of the Dead from this point. Thankfully, this is far from the case with Purification.Moody continues to develop not only his characters and the undead in this third instalment of the Autumn series but the universe which they occupy also. The tone of the book, as with its predecessors, is suitably bleak and the focus is very much on the plight of the characters, the daily trials they suffer, how they cope with their own emotions and despair; and how much they have changed despite less than six weeks having passed since the cataclysmic event which wiped out the majority of the planet's population and the dead started to rise. At the same time, Moody pays attention to the degradation of the physical states of the walking dead, but Purification, as with the previous instalments in the Autumn series, sees the shambling corpses continue to evolve in a fashion that I can only imagine that other authors wish they had thought of first...Although there is plenty of action, death and decaying flesh in this book and it is undoubtedly at home in the horror genre, it will leave those looking for an adrenaline-fuelled mindless zombie tale unsatisifed. I would submit to you that this is no bad thing. Autumn: Purification continues to flesh out Moody's Autumn universe admirably and although this book only runs to 260 or so pages and could be read as a stand alone title, I would suggest to any potential reader to do as I have done and read the series from the start since it has greatly enhanced my enjoyment of each of the books by taking them in sequence.There's no need to take my word for it either, award-winning author Jonathan Maberry said of Autumn that: \"This is smart fiction, written with style and insight. Not for the gore-hounds who can't think past a pile of entrails, but the rest of the readers in the world.\"Taking into account my love of post-apocalyptica and how many books concering the sub-genre that I read, I can honestly say that Autumn has, to date, seriously impressed me and consistently hits the mark where so many other books fail and simply rely on gore and decay. In short, my advice to genre fans is simple. Get involved with the Autumn series as soon as possible. You won't regret it."}, {"userName": "Mkittysamom", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9901011-mkittysamom", "userReview": "At first I didn't understand what David Moody was trying to say in Autumn. I watched the movie and it dawned on me that this story is dark, and tinged with human emotions. The Zombies are also unique, kind of like Romero but in each book they gain more intelligence as they rot away. I actually feel for the zombies now. I never know which character is going to bite the dust, and I am amazed that Michael and Emma have continued to survive. Michael has always had a negative point of view and now he thinks that the human race is purposely being \"purified\" from the earth. Nature is taking back the lands and the \"zombies\" are rotting. Now there are only a few survivors living on a \"cold,bleak\" island. I really appreciate the darkness, because I think this version of the apocalypse is closer to reality. We are very emotional and have gotten weak as we've let technology do everything for us...so no one no longer has the skills to survive. So many of them just sit and stare, and stay immobilized in terror. * update from re-read dec 2016 Wow.. whew that was a nail biting, heart pounding ending. I a enjoying these books way more than I did the first time. I thought they were boring, but with a birthday just passed the wisdom of the author is now aligned with my thoughts while reading and understanding. I love that the zombies are affected by a supposedly good germ..and so far they don't eat people. My fav characters Michael, Emma, and Cooper are awesome. I know some people have to die but I am relieved that a bunch of main characters have made it far. Now it seems they are struggling with their last decision to move once again. Is it paradise? Or..have the complexities of this harsh life only changed instead of getting better, or for that matter is life less harsh? So many questions! Did God purify the Earth? I don't buy it because of all the innocents that died, I think it was a biological accidental disaster. But I think God is still up there watching over his people..and doing his best under the weird circumstances. He prob doesn't like that the souls are trapped in the dead ppl, and they suffer just as much as the humans. The only ones who didn't suffer where the people who died in 30 seconds and didn't get back up. This story brings up all kinds of topics to mind, and really makes the reader sympathetic to even \"dead\" characters... yea.. On to the next one where I got stuck and shelved the series.

It's a great instalment. This series is getting better and better and I'm really enjoying it. The tension, suspense and horror is still prevalent as the zombies continue to evolve into something even more terrifying.The opening scene is fantastic. The underground army is plotting to go up into the world and push back the thousands of zombies that have accumulated above the underground bunker. The vents, which are keeping the soldiers and civilian's alive are being blocked by the growing number of zombies. After a few attempts at trying to secure the vents and clear the zombies, they decide to try and push back the zombies even further and all hell breaks lose.This battle scene is just brilliant. Although the zombies aren't particularly hard to deal with individually, the are a terrifying force when grouped together in their thousands. It was so exciting and horrifying all at once. What was a relatively safe place is now over run and the remaining survivors have to fight their way out.Once secure in a building away from the hordes, Michael, Emma and the others are dumbfounded when a helicopter lands outside the building they are hiding in. This is the beginning of something new and to realise there are others out there scares and excites them. They are told other survivors are safely contained in an airport where they have a small plane as well as the helicopter. With slight trepidation they decide to join the new survivors at the airport. Once there they learn that these survivors will eventually head out to an island they've found and are happy for Michael and his group to join them.We meet lots of new characters, as well as continuing to follow Michael and Emma (my favourite characters). Their relationship has moved on (luckily in the way I had hoped) but are finding it difficult. But being in a larger group of people, new faces and a new, more secure home, they all begin to feel hope again and make new friends, but of course this doesn't last for long...Another brilliant instalment from David Moody. As with the previous books in the Autumn series, I couldn't put Purification down. This series is a fantastic addition to the zombie genre.

Although the beginning of the zombie infections are usually my favorite aspect of a story, I have to admit this is by far my favorite book in the series so far even though the beginnings of the infection are now long gone. Due to the ending of the last book and I think partially from the cover art I was expecting most of this book to take place in and around the military base the characters ended up at in the last one, but they got away from that pretty fast. The group finding another group of survivors was something that really caught me off guard. Looking back I should have expected lots of other little groups of people left in the story, but David Moody does such a good job and telling the story in a way that makes the world seem so bleak and the characters feel so alone that it never entered my mind others would come into the mix.It was a slight relief that this new group had their shit a bit more together, because frankly the group of characters we had been following through the first two books were pretty damn incompetent. It was also nice that some finally came up with the idea of heading to an island, and idea I always feel is under used in Zombie lit. But the biggest relief plot wise was there was some kind of explanation for the zombie outbreak given. It's presented in a way that both the characters and the reader can either take it at face value, dismiss it out of hand, or go for some mid ground so it's no real concrete answer. But I'm okay with that, what had been bugging me was that it seemed no kind of answer was forthcoming at all.The end of the book was exceptional and like all David Moody books that last third is really hard to put down and keeps you turning pages and keeps your heart racing."}, {"userName": "Alyce Hunt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6454474-alyce-hunt", "userReview": "'Now, several days since any of the soldiers had been above ground, almost one hundred thousand bodies had gathered around the bunker, every last one of them fighting to get nearer to its impassable entrance.'I only finished the second book in David Moody's Autumn series yesterday, and I was so excited by the ending that I just had to dive straight into this one which - as you can tell by this review - I've already managed to finish.When we left our survivors they'd just managed to gain entry into the military bunker where Cooper had been sheltering from the day the virus struck. Being in a safe and secure environment for the first time in two months, I'd expected our survivors might have gotten complacent, but the exact opposite happened: if anything, being with the military ratcheted their anxiety through the roof as they wondered what they'd enlist them to do.Because of the noise from the soldiers coming and going, hundreds upon thousands of corpses gathered outside the bunker, covering the grates in the ground that allow air to pass through the filtration system. The soldiers know that oxygen is running out, so they plot to go above ground and park jeeps over the grates to allow the air free passage. Their first attempt goes well and they manage to unblock two grates and kill a handful of cadavers, but when they go for round two and try to clear more grates, their entire operation falls apart.This means it takes less than fifty pages for our survivors to find themselves fleeing from the military bunker, once more displaced in the countryside.Read the rest of my review here!"}, {"userName": "Michele", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7251365-michele", "userReview": "The Autumn series took a huge leap with Purification. First we were able to see how the disease hit the countryside and then the city - allowing us to see that there really wasn't a way to outsmart the apocalypse (because we always think we know a better way).

Then comes Purification to not only allow us to move forward with the group and debate if there can be a future but also allows a glimpse at a possible cause....with a caution that, well, does it truly matter if we are still in this situation? You can feel the experience. Moody has a way of not just telling you but helping you feel the experience with the characters. While there have been two common characters strung through the series, he makes use of several types of charaxcters with a greay diversity of demeanor and background. While it helps paint a great picture in the narratrive, it also helps you to identify wi8th the scenario. You can identify with someone somewhere and it piques the interest on a different level.

Because rotting corpses... well, rot... things are getting slightly different for the survivors. The creatures that have been tormenting them are changing. They are less on the attack and more on the move for self-preservation. Will this be better or worse for the survivors? Since the survivors are perceived as a threat to the survival of zombies, you do the math.Our intrepid band, holed up in the underground military bunker they discovered at the end of the last novel in the series, ends up on the move again as, just as Michael predicts each time we think they're safely ensconced somewhere, things begin to fall apart. Helicopters, car chases, zombie fights, stolen vehicles, airplanes, mass attacks, and ambushes abound. It seemed to me there was more action in this novel and less waiting around, which was a nice change of pace. You know, don't want your scary novel to get too slow or anything!

Unfortunately, the soldiers in said bunker have been cut off from the virus and are not immune, making things complicated for the groups. As the dead swarm above, the survivors come to the conclusion that they must soon move on. Their opportunity comes when the soldiers begin a mass attack on the horde outside. Third in the series of five presents new challenges to the growing group. The interaction with the military was brief. Not sure if this element will return (though they're kind of doomed anyway). The end of PURIFICATION was great, though, and I look forward to what comes next for these poor survivors!"}, {"userName": "Florence", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8022562-florence", "userReview": "[I am so happy they got an island istead of bugging in some big building.

This is where I get a little confused. There are several books in the series and this one seemed to wrap everything up. Don't get me wrong. It's a great book and a great ending; however you find out at the beginning of book 4 that there were some complications with the publishers and the author had actually written some other books with different characters but the same major plot. I don't thank the other books should have been added to the set but what the heck. I'm off to Book 4..."}, {"userName": "Metagion", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5881931-metagion", "userReview": "This is a cool book, and I recommend it...Lots of zombies (of course) but it takes the perspective of not only the survivors but also the military as they deal with the Undead threat and the conditions that they endure in survival...I really like the fact that it draws you in and makes you feel the desperation of the folks (military AND civilian alike) and the conditions they face. The ONLY drawback to these series is it's set in England; if you're not familiar with English phrases and places you'll be a 'bit' lost. :)"}, {"userName": "UniqueBookJunkie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4183430-uniquebookjunkie", "userReview": "GREAT series still.. I enjoyed this book just as much as the others.. I am looking forward to what happens with the group.. I hope there is more in store for Michael and Emma.. I am also looking forward to hearing more about Cooper.. I would have to say they are my favorites.. There were parts in there I was like what.. nail biting and yes even at times sitting there talking to myself about things they could do or should have done.. lol.. although you tell anyone I will deny it.. Looking forward to getting into the 4th book.. :)"}], "description": "A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle survivors are forced to contend with in a world torn apart by a deadly disease. 99% of the population of the planet has been killed in less than 24 hours. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, the bodies soon regain their most basic senses and abilities\u2014sight, hearing, locomotion\u2014as well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal\u2014to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1...In Autumn: Purification, the heroes from the original Autumn novel and Autumn: The City work together to survive in this horrifying new world.Without ever using the \u2018Z' word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There's no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore's sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of a George Romero film with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days Later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.", "title": "Purification\n      \n          (Autumn #3)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9998730-purification", "average": 3.99, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1317067444l/9998730.jpg", "reviews": 91, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/117582.David_Moody", "name": "David Moody"}], "type": ["Horror", "Horror", "Fiction", "Apocalyptic", "Science Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9998730-purification", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233710.Purification", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9216960-purification", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8517362-purification", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11525929-purification", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17561261-zona-zombie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6739080-hater", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8103876-autumn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7171452-dog-blood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8723188-the-city", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9219992-them-or-us"]}
