I\u2019m always horrified at what the Nazis did to the Jewish community. My brain just can\u2019t comprehend the decimation of 90% of European Jews. I just don\u2019t understand how people can have so much hate to do the things they did to neighbors and friends. With the current election happening and the hate spewing from he who shall not be named, it makes me think of all the lives that were lost during World War II.This time in The Orpheus Clock: The Search for My Family\u2019s Art Treasures Stolen by the Nazis, Simon Goodman and his brother Nick take up the search to find their family heritage that their father Bernard spent many, many years searching for until his sudden death while swimming.I watched the movie Monuments Men and was shocked at the way the Nazis just went in and took what they wanted from private collections, museums and churches. They were literally breaking off mantels from fireplaces then throwing the items on trains or hiding them in caves dripping of water.In The Orpheus Clock, Simon receives several boxes after his father dies, which holds many detailed documents about all the artwork, silver and other valuable that were in his family\u2019s collection and have been missing for years. His father immediately started looking for the artwork right after the war ended.Simon does a great job telling his grandparent\u2019s story. How they established the bank, built their immense wealth and how they died in a work camp. He also did a great job of detailing what transpired as the Nazis started to gain strength and continuously took from the Jews. It\u2019s so appalling how the Nazis just kept pecking and pecking, slowing stripping the Jews of their livelihood and their humanity. There is still so much artwork that has not been claimed. I wonder if it\u2019s because the families are no longer around, whether they don\u2019t have the documentation to get their belongings back, don\u2019t have the resources to fight or they have given up because too many people fight them along the way. It\u2019s appalling the people who don\u2019t want to give items back like Daniel Searle even though Simon and Nick had solid proof they were the owners of a painting he had in his possession. Sometimes it takes years to get items back. When Simon finds the Orpheus Clock, which is at the Landesmuseum Wurttemberg in Stuttgart, I thought the museum workers were very kind. Several of the items Simon recovered are still being displayed in museums. Some the family sold to help with the search and some are still lost. While reading what Simon and Nick went through to prove an item was part of the Gutmann collection, I wanted to yell \u201cjust give them the item!\u201dThis is a fascinating book about a part of World War II most people don\u2019t know about. It makes me wonder while I was walking through the Berlin museums in 2012, were any of the artwork I was admiring stolen by the Nazis and still not claimed by the correct owners?"}, {"userName": "David V.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4661664-david-v", "userReview": "Received as an ARC from the publisher. Began 6-8-15. Finished 6-13-15.Compelling story, well-told. The first half of the book describes what the Holocaust did to this wealthy Jewish family in Germany, Including the Nazi thefts of their extensive art collection, as well as collections of friends and extended family. The 2nd half reads like a treasure hunting book as the author and his relatives try to find the hundreds of art items stolen from their family. They search military archives, auction houses, galleries, museums, etc., and deal with 50-60 year old laws to establish provenance, as well as uncooperative governments, private collectors, and museum directors. If you've seen the movie The Monuments Men, then this is an excellent companion piece. Although the military men of this unit shut down in the late 40's, the Foundation still exists, and they are still looking for art."}, {"userName": "Cindy H.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16311569-cindy-h", "userReview": "I\u2019m a sucker for any true Holocaust memoir, story - I feel I owe it to those who perished and those that survived that I read their story and hear their voice.

Then I read The Monuments Men, about the group of Allied soldiers who were supposed to find and protect things during WWII, including but not limited to art. And then I read another book about going undercover to recover art stolen from museums. Basically, art is valuable, relatively easy to move, and relatively hard to track, which means it ends up getting used as currency in all kinds of transactions and then surfacing at some point with its provenance not really being on the firmest ground. This is basically what The Orpheus Clock (or the last 120 pages of it) is about.After Simon Goodman's father died, Simon and his brother Nick got all of these boxes containing documents about what their father had covertly been doing for the past half century: running around trying to recover the art and belonging that had been stolen from his family by the Nazis during WWII. After realizing exactly what the scale of it was, Simon (and to some extent Nick, though he features much less prominently in this book) took up his father's search. The Goodman family, then spelled \"Gutmann,\" were Jewish in heritage though not really practice and were living in the Netherlands when the war started. Generations of being banking magnates meant the family, in all its branches, was pretty wealthy, and Simon's grandfather was keeper of the family trust, which was massive. There was a big house and lots of silver and fancy paintings. And then, of course, because the Gutmanns were Jewish, the Nazis took it all and sent Simon's grandparents to a concentration camp, from which they didn't return alive. Simon's father and aunt survived because they were living in England and Italy, respectively.Now, reparations from the Holocaust are a really tricky subject because there's not a firm good way to handle them. Here's the thing. A lot of these belongings have popped up over the years with seemingly good providence, and so someone buys one of the things thinking it's okay. And then, BANG! It turns out it's not okay, that it's actually loot. But the person who has it now still likes the thing, for the thing itself and not the history attached to it, and paid a lot of money for the thing, so obviously they're not so keen to give it up. But the family that originally owned the thing wants it back because it shouldn't have been taken away from them in the first place. Is there a good way to deal with this? No, not really. It's much easier when it's the government that still has the thing, because then at least it's not private individuals tangled up in it.What this book does well is lays out the complexities of how hard it actually is to get back items that were taken during the Holocaust, because many of them have been scattered to the winds and then surfaced all over the place with seemingly clean backgrounds. Did people look too hard at these backgrounds? No, not really. But then, if you look at the backgrounds of a lot of art, they're not really as clean as we'd like, which makes art trading in its entirety a very dirty and complicated business. But I couldn't help but wonder why Goodman was doing this the whole time, and yes, I confess, he came off as a bit greedy, because his family didn't even want most of the stuff and ended up selling it immediately after they got it. I know, I know; it's more complicated than that, because the money is rightfully theirs anyway, and so on and so forth. That's fine; they're entitled to it. But I feel like there could have been a better way to convey that than how Goodman did it. It was the language he used about it, being so smug about items selling for much more than their appraisal values and such, and how he seemingly wasn't willing to work with people who thought they were buying (or receiving, in the cases of donated pieces) \"clean\" art. It was...I dunno. It just had a dirty feel about the whole process, when really it shouldn't have. Them getting the stuff back from the Dutch government was much \"cleaner\" feeling to me, because it was really freakin' wrong of the government to keep all that stuff for all that time when they had a pretty good idea of who it had belonged to. It's when people who didn't know and didn't have reason to got involved that it all had a sort of icky feel to it.Also, more than half of this book isn't about getting art treasures back at all. It's a multi-generational history of Goodman's family which wasn't entirely necessary for the book. I think all of that could have been condensed to a chapter or two, at most, and then the rest of the book focused on the retrieval process, because that's what the book purports to be about. I get that Goodman has discovered this incredibly lush and complex family history and wants to include it, but if that's the case the publisher should have looked into titling the book more accurately, because it was pretty misleading reading about bankers for 180+ pages (out of a 320-page book) when I thought I was going to be reading about art recovery.3 stars out of 5."}, {"userName": "Nancy A", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47110624-nancy-a", "userReview": "If you loved De Waal's book, The Hare with Amber Eyes, The Orpheus Clock is a must.This is the kind of history I enjoy reading most because it provides a personal provenance for great art that is absent from the general history of the genre.A piece of trivia I picked up in a college Art History class revealed that 99% of all the art ever created has been lost to the ravages of history.Wars,invasions,natural disasters and human stupidity have all contributed to this high mortality rate.The Orpheus Clock fleshes out a part of this story by detailing how the art collection of one family fell victim to the Nazis during WWII.Goodman,the grandson of the original collector, gives the reader a riveting account of his family history before,during, and after the war including photographs.The original collection comprised work from some of the most important artists of the early Renaissance through the beginning of the 20th Century including sculpture and precious metals.What makes this book so rewarding is that Goodman is able to reclaim some of the collection.What makes this book so engaging is the skill of the writer.At times this narrative reads like a thriller but more importantly,Goodman taps into the wellspring of loss experienced by those who were robbed of everything especially their families.You don't have to be a history fan to love this book but if all the history books were written like this everyone WOULD love it!!"}, {"userName": "Andrea Balfour", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5243321-andrea-balfour", "userReview": "Truly a 3.5 to me.

That was the question that was asked after the devastation the Nazis caused in this gripping tale. The Goodman family treasures were stolen by the Nazis and the family had a paper trail to prove it belonged to them. You would assume that the surviving heirs would be able to reclaim the family art, but instead there was a concerted attempt by museums and collectors to keep the art rather than return it, even when confronted with proof. The description of original Goodman family that owned the art gave the reader an insight into the privileged lives of the very wealthy German jews. They invested in beautiful art works and were very involved in society. Sadly, they made a fatal mistake not to flee the Nazis when they had a chance and paid the ultimate price.

There's not much I can add to the other favorable reviews but I'll give it a try!Seventy or so years ago, Simon's grandparents - both converted Jews to Lutheranism - had their privately-held art treasures stolen \"legally\" from their house in the Netherlands by the Nazis. Fritz and Louise Gutmann - their son changed the name to Goodman - had been collecting art for years and building on the collection inherited from Fritz's father, Eugen. Eugen Gutmann had founded a bank in Dresden that later merged with others to form the Dresdner Bank. The huge bank was \"Aryanised\" during the Nazi era, but by then Eugen had died. His son Fritz was the family keeper and continued his father's art collecting. Their collection was fairly varied - everything from Rembrandt to a Franz Stuck portrait of a woman and a snake in a VERY compromising position! Fritz and Louise had fled from Germany to Holland with their paintings, sculptures, and silver collection. That silver collection - the Eugen Gutmann Silversammlung - and their refusal to give it up after having lost so much else to the Nazis - was the cause of Fritz and Louise's deaths in Nazi concentration camps.Their son - Bernard - had been able to emigrate to England before the war began. He had been born in England during his parents' stay during the First World war. His sister - Lili - had found relative safety in Italy through her marriages to Italian men. After the war, Bernard began the agonising search for his parents' stolen art pieces. But he was thwarted in his search through governmental stonewalling and for the next 50 years - until his death in the mid-1990's - he found very few pieces. After his death, he \"bequeathed\" the search to his two sons, Simon and Nick. They took up where he left off and the book is the story of their search for the pieces of art that had been scattered through the world, both during and after the war. Pieces were bought and sold and in most cases, the buyers didn't look too hard at the provenance of the pieces.Eventually, through great use of the internet data bases, Simon and Nick were able to track down many pieces of the Gutmann collection. The book also details their use of the law in getting these pieces returned to their rightful owners. (Simon and Nick Goodman were not the only people searching for their family's treasures. He mentions the Maria Altmann/Randol Schoenberg fight for the Gustav Klimpt paintings of Maria's aunt, as detailed in the movie, \"Woman in Gold\")Simon Goodman is a very good writer and his account of both his family's history and the fight to regain their lost legacy is wonderful reading. Included in the book are some family pictures, but also pictures of some of the pieces he and his brother fought to save. He credits others in helping them in their search and battles. Very good book."}, {"userName": "Genna", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32565660-genna", "userReview": "\ufeff\"I know, rationally, that even under the Nazis there surely were sunny days; I just can't see it. Whenever I think of my grandparents during the Nazi nightmare, I envision them only in the monochromatic shades of World War II newsreels, under clouds of SS black and skies of Wehrmacht gray.\"\ufeff\ufeffThe systematic looting and destruction of Jewish art during WWII has long enthralled me in both fascination and horror. While I've read a variety of literature on this particularly ugly period of world history, this is my first experience with a personalized account. The Orpheus Clock is something of a fifty year long detective story, begun widely in secret by Goodman's father, and which spans generations and continents. I enjoyed a rather scathing inside look at the art markets of 20th century Europe and now, cameos by the indomitable Rose Valland, and an enlightening (not in a good way) expos\u00e9 on the rather dastardly actions of the Dutch government following WWII.\"That a sturdy bronze, fifteenth-century mortar and pestle, with German coat of arms, had survived was not so surprising, but close by were two ancient cushions still in remarkable condition. Embroidered on both was their year of creation--1689. They seemed to epitomize to what lengths the Nazis had gone to preserve everything of value--except human life.\"The Orpheus Clock is a story, ultimately, of restitution. While Goodman is not a natural writer, emphasized by periodic awkward phrasing and repetitive word choice, his family's story is haunting and resounding. An unfortunately all too common example of entire families who not only lost their lives but were stripped of their legacies and cultural heritage as well. Goodman's research is impeccable as he outlines the Gutmann banking dynasty rise to social and political prominence and their subsequent evisceration by the Nazis.The bulk of The Orpheus Clock, and the most compelling aspect, is detailing of the intensive and far-reaching investigation Goodman and his brother launched in order to reclaim their family legacy. They tirelessly track many of the thousands of missing pieces from the Gutmann collection through history in order to fight for their return. This account does not mince words as the Goodman family files lawsuits, struggles through endless bureaucratic red tape, conducts investigations, and fights resistant collectors and museums for their rightful inheritance. The actions of the Goodman family paved the way for auction house reform and the development of Holocaust-era restitution policies, while encouraging countless other families to pursue their own sense of justice. A passionate, monumentally important text."}, {"userName": "Adam Hummel", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15336788-adam-hummel", "userReview": "I heard about this book when it was first published and added it to my mental \"to-read\" list, since I've always been interested in WW2/Holocaust history, and the art thefts in Europe at the time. A few weeks ago I was watching a Senate Judiciary Hearing on art restitution in Europe, and among the other distinguished speakers, including Ronald Lauder and Hellen Mirren, was Simon Goodman. As soon as I heard his name, it reminded me of the name of his book, and while watching the hearing, and hearing Mr. Goodman speak, which was fascinating (he was an exceptionally compelling speaker and very knowledgeable on the subject), I bought this book online.As soon as it arrived, I devoured it, and I enjoyed every page. He told a fascinating story about his family, originally Jewish but converted at a time in Europe where it was more helpful to be non-Jewish, but ultimately treated as Jews leading up to and during WW2. His family's history is like that of many upper-class Jewish families in Europe, but it was clear that the treasures they accumulated were unlike others, which made them particularly desirable for the Nazis. Goodman spends a good deal of time going through why each treasure was important, both for its intrinsic value, as well as it's value to his family, and made me root him on throughout his book, wanting him to find everything that he set out to find. I was most interested by the reactions that he got from different institutions and private owners, whether rich industrialists or modern museums. It was fascinating seeing how some reacted to their realization that they had inherited Nazi spoils, while others were just in it for the glory, and set up whatever obstacles they could.Having read the book, I now understand clearly why Goodman was called upon to testify in the Senate in support of a new law enabling those owners of Nazi looted art to bring lawsuits in a timely fashion, without being concerned about legal/administrative barriers to bringing the claim. This book is a must read for anyone interested in Nazi looted art, does an exceptional job of telling the story of one exceptional family, and left me wanting to read every other book on the subject.

It is legible, cohesive, coherent, interesting and the subject is a new one for me. The Orpheus Clock moves slowly and can get bogged down in family names and relationships as it is extremely detailed in that regard yet it is neither boring nor pretentious. I learned a great deal about the treatment and behavior of one of the most wealthy and extremely powerful Jewish banking families of Europe and how they behaved and viewed themselves during WW2. This is new territory for me; the destruction of the Jewish elite and the theft of their art collections by the Nazis and the massive effort it took and is still taking to reclaim by heirs what belongs to this particular family. It stunned me to read how the family has had to buy back their stolen treasures. First the Nazi's stole the priceless family treasures and then after the War, the family got tangled up in unsympathetic Post War courts that forced the family to BUY, BUY BACK THEIR STOLEN TREASURES even though they could prove that they were theirs in the first place. Realize that the Nazi's stole their family money too. What irony. This is the frosting on the cake as it were since much of the family met their deaths at the hands of the Nazi's and as such there are extremely poignant passages when we read how the various family members met with their deaths."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/865798-linda", "userReview": "When Simon and his brother received a box of their father's files after his death, some pieces of a family puzzle fell into place, and Simon's career in Los Angeles in the pop music business took quite a turn to history, fine art and family genealogy. The Orpheus Clock was just one of the priceless Renaissance treasures that Simon and his family should have inherited. His great grandfather had founded one of Germany's most influential banks in the 1800s, and he and his son began collecting art. But they also happened to be Jewish, and except for Simon's father who had settled in England and other internationally scattered cousins, there were no survivors of the Holocaust. The art was taken by Nazis. This is Simon's personal story of research, persistence, patience, and frustration to untangle the web of where all these pieces had ended up in the 70+ years since their theft. It makes you want to scream at the bureaucratic and Catch-22 details of red tape that various governments demanded, and the stonewalling by banks, collectors, auction houses and museums. But this was his defiance of the Nazi's attempt to erase his family, his memorial to their lives as shown by their artistic tastes. Along the way, he meets some good people who did the right thing, heals some family divisions, and promotes the concept and work of restitution."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/909198-mary", "userReview": "The Orpheus Clock itself is a gorgeous metalwork table clock of great value. The book of the same name contains a beautiful color photo, even in the trade paperback edition, of this work of art. Mr. Simon, the author, has spent a large part of his life doing what his father was unable to do. Both men were searching for a vast number of items procured by the Nazis, through forced sales and out right theft, from the vast collection of art works and fine household goods owned by Mr Simon's grand father and great grandfather.Mr. Simon's great grandfather was the founder of the Dresdner Bank and accumulated a fortune. His grandfather carried on the banking business before he and his wife lost their lives and possessions to the Nazis. This book describes how Mr. Simon helped by the advent of the digital age and the extensive library at the Getty museum located many of the stolen items. Some were graciously returned after being provided with proof of ownership and others required legal battles.

I loved how Simon discovered his family history and seemed to find purpose. I'm so happy that his family's rightful history and property is being slowly retuned. It is sad that the European governments at the end of WWII seemed as greedy as the Nazis. No matter how many times I've seen, read and heard the barbarism of the Nazis I can't seem to get my head around it. The why seems so far away from reality for me. Here is yet another example of how real people were drug into this. As I watch current events unfold in the world, I wonder if the Jew is about to be subjected to yet another round of persecution. I don't remember who said it originally but \"those who fall to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.\" I fear this is a lesson we as humans can't seem to get."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/572977-kate", "userReview": "Positively fascinating history of Goodman's very wealthy family in the Holocaust, and the fight to regain the art collection lost to them. I must say I felt a bit poorer than usual when Goodman wrote contemptuously that the ultra-rich live in a different world than the rest of us, just about the same time he mentioned the six-figure cost of his current court battle (is that the difference between the 1% and the .01%? I didn't feel like part of Goodman's rest-of-us for sure.). I knew that surviving Jews were extremely poorly treated by many Governments after WWII but this gave me a whole new perspective on unfairness and the human tendency to resent victims and fear those who might take advantage despite the real harm done to the sincere. Plus: mysteries, history, artifact hunts, research!!!! Goodman is certainly an author after my own heart."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25331265-christine", "userReview": "An amazing odyssey of a family locating art lost in the holocaust and finding family connection. It was eye-opening to the roadblocks placed in their way as they located and tried to repatriate missing art, the intransigence of governments and organizations. In some respects this family was able to change how the many Jewish families who lost parents, grandparents, friends during WWII and how they could locate and recover the many possessions taken from them. In places the narrative bogged down a bit, so many dealers, galleries, government officials - trying to keep the names and actions straight was a bit challenging but didn't diminish the power of the story.

I will be checking out the 60 Minutes and documentaries associated with this family story. This is really well written, and I hope that this family succeeds in finding their lost property. How Mr. Goodman kept from screaming in the faces of the intransigent art collectors, curators, museum directors, bankers, lawyers, state officials and anyone else in his quest is a testimony to his upbringing and fortitude. My only quibble: I wish there had been an extensive photo section of the lost artworks. There are a few photos, but not enough.

That's almost all he knew about them \u2014 his father rarely spoke of their family history or heritage. But when he passed away, and Simon received his father's old papers, a story began to emerge.   The Gutmanns rose from a small Bohemian hamlet to become one of Germany's most powerful banking families. They also amassed a magnificent, world-class art collection that included works by Degas, Renoir, Botticelli, Guardi, and many, many others. But the Nazi regime snatched from them everything they had worked to build: their remarkable art, their immense wealth, their prominent social standing, and their very lives.  Simon grew up in London with little knowledge of his father's efforts to recover their family's prized possessions. It was only after his father's death that Simon began to piece together the clues about the Gutmanns' stolen legacy and the Nazi looting machine. Through painstaking detective work across two continents, Simon has been able to prove that many works belonged to his family, and to successfully secure their return.  Goodman's dramatic story, told with great heart, reveals a rich family history almost obliterated by the Nazis. It is not only the account of a twenty-year long detective hunt for family treasure, but an unforgettable tale of redemption and restoration.", "title": "The Orpheus Clock: the search for my family's art treasures stolen by the Nazis", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26026406-the-orpheus-clock", "average": 4.05, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1441776535l/26026406.jpg", "reviews": 82, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9824975.Simon_Goodman", "name": "Simon Goodman"}], "type": ["History", "Art", "Nonfiction", "War", "World War II"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26026406-the-orpheus-clock", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23492837-the-orpheus-clock", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25847111-the-orpheus-clock", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25706892-the-orpheus-clock", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29609932-l-orologio-di-orfeo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839523-l-orologio-di-orfeo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25860237-the-language-of-asylum", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31891291-the-language-of-asylum"]}
