At age twelve the nuns beat me for \"being too free with my body.\" All I had been doing was holding hands with a boy. At age fifteen I was raped. If you plan to be born, make sure you are born white and male.The above paragraph appears on the very second page of Mary Crow Dog\u2019s memoir, Lakota Woman. In a sense, it encapsulates the whole tale.I do not know when I came across the term \u2018subaltern\u2019: most probably it was in the eighties, in a book dealing with Dalit issues in India. This term, popularised by the Subaltern Studies Group of South Asian scholars, is derived from the Italian communist Antonio Gramsci. Wikipedia says \u201cIn critical theory and postcolonialism, subaltern refers the populations that are socially, politically and geographically outside of the hegemonic power structure of the colony and of the colonial homeland.\u201d In simple terms, they are people on the margins of the book which describes great colonial epic of civilisation.We have many such people scattered all over the world: people who have been choked by a much more powerful occupier, pushed along to the fringes of society, and forced to eke out a meagre existence. The American Indians (or Native Americans, as they are called now) are such a people. Until fairly recently, the world as a whole did not know much about them, other than as bloodthirsty savages who rode about with painted faces, let out bloodcurdling shrieks, kidnapped and raped women and tortured men to death \u2013 a fiction perpetrated by Western movies and novels. They were the demons \u2013 the \u2018Injuns\u2019 \u2013 whom the \u2018brave\u2019 cowboys killed.I awoke from this myth engendered by the Spaghetti Westerns once I started reading history, and learnt reality was the opposite of what was shown in the movies \u2013 the red man was brave, honourable and peaceful; the white man was cowardly, cunning and rapacious. The creation of America was actually a tragedy of gargantuan proportions for the original inhabitants of the continent. For them, the so-called \u2018American Dream\u2019 is a never-ending nightmare.***Mary Crow Dog was born piss-poor on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota. As with many Indian families, her father was a wastrel who did not take care of his family: she was raised by her grandparents. Mary grew up experiencing racism in its every form. The Indians were openly despised by the white people, and in those days, they did not need to hide it. Their traditional style of living destroyed, their men caught in the vicious circle of drink and despondency, and their women open to exploitation of all forms, the original inhabitants of the land were on a fast downward spiral to oblivion.The \u2018civilising\u2019 forces were at work on all fronts. Denied land and justice, Indians were supplied with the one thing that the white man had in abundance \u2013 religion. The traditional religions were all but outlawed, and Christianity was being forced down the throats of the natives. Mary too was born a Catholic; she had the \u2018fortune\u2019 to attend a boarding school run by nuns, whose motto was \u201ccivilise them with a stick\u201d.It is almost impossible to explain to a sympathetic white person what a typical old Indian boarding school was like; how it affected the Indian child suddenly dumped into it like a small creature from another world, helpless, defenseless, bewildered, trying desperately and instinctively to survive and sometimes not surviving at all. I think such children were like the victims of Nazi concentration camps trying to tell average, middle-class Americans what their experience had been like\u2026\u2026The kids were taken away from their villages and pueblos, in their blankets and moccasins, kept completely isolated from their families-sometimes for as long as ten years-suddenly coming back, their short hair slick with pomade, their necks raw from stiff, high collars, their thick jackets always short in the sleeves and pinching under the arms, their tight patent leather shoes giving them corns, the girls in starched white blouses and clumsy, high-buttoned boots-caricatures of white people. When they found out-and they found out quickly-that they were neither wanted by whites nor by Indians, they got good and drunk, many of them staying drunk for the rest of their lives. In the school, the Indian children were submerged into a world dominated by guilt and sin. They were made to feel guilty about their bodies and bodily cravings \u2013 everything was viewed through the red lens of sin (maybe because the sisters were so steeped in it, to hear it the way Mary tells it) and even the smallest digressions invited severe chastisements.The kids tried to run away, frequently: they were almost always immediately caught and brought back to the school, and subjected to corporeal punishment. The nuns thought nothing of bending teenaged girls over chairs, lifting their skirts, and whipping them mercilessly with straps \u2013 the same treatment was meted out to boys by the male teachers.Spirited Mary (and many others like her, including her sister Barbara) rebelled. Mary left without completing her course, after punching a priest in the face. Like countless times in history, the desire of the authorities to enforce discipline without justice had created a revolutionary.***People talk about the \"Indian drinking problem, \" but we say that it is a white problem. White men invented whiskey and brought it to America. They manufacture, advertise, and sell it to us. They make the profit on it and cause the conditions that make Indians drink in the first place. A dropout from school with no aim in life, Mary started drinking and hanging out with similar shiftless youths. A lot of her time was spent in fighting: because, according to her, drinking does not help one forget; rather one remembers \u201call the old insults and hatreds, real and imagined\u201d. So the next thing to do is pick a fight \u2013 and there are always white rednecks who oblige. And the fights are often violent.I have often thought that given an extreme situation, I'd have it in me to kill, if that was the only way. I think if one gets into an \"either me or you\" situation, that feeling is instinctive. The average white person seldom gets into such a corner, but that corner is where the Indian lives, whether he wants to or not. Mary recounts various crimes against Indians, often repeatedly, in her memoir. Her aunt, the powerful \u2018turtle woman\u2019, who was found beaten to death in her home, face down with weeds in her hair; Annie Mae Aquash, an activist who was raped and murdered and whose death was reported as natural, from exposure; Indian men were killed and women were raped by white men with impunity, while even the smallest protest by an Indian resulted in arrest and incarceration. The system thus succeeded in criminalising a peaceful people; then prosecuting them for their criminal activities.The thing to keep in mind is that laws are framed by those who happen to be in power and for the purpose of keeping them in power. That goes for the U. S. A. as well as for Russia or any other country in the world .Ultimately, the alleged criminality of Indians became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Mistreated by a monstrous system whom they could not confront head on, Native American youth became spit-and-run warriors: a spot of vandalism here, an incident of shoplifting there\u2026 Mary says that they did not consider pilferage from shops as theft, because they were only re-appropriating what is theirs by right. And so it would have gone on, unless she had discovered AIM (the American Indian Movement) and literally found an aim in life.***The major part of this memoir is structured around a specific event in the history of Native American awakening \u2013 the 1973 occupation of Wounded Knee town by a group of AIM members, and their subsequent standoff with the FBI and US Marshalls. This is significant to Mary for two reasons, one political and the other personal \u2013 this was the first Indian movement which received massive media coverage and broadcast the condition of the Native American population to the world: and this was where Mary met her husband, Leonard Crow Dog, and gave birth to her first child among the flying bullets.Wounded Knee, to the American Indian, is a sacred place. It holds the same place of awed reverence that Jallianwala Bagh holds in the mind of Indians. It was here that the U. S. Cavalry massacred over 200 people including children, Lakota Indians who had gathered there to perform the \u201cGhost Dance\u201d that the government had outlawed. Here\u2019s one telling image from the massacre, as told to Mary by her grandfather:It was only two miles or so from where Grandfather Fool Bull stood that almost three hundred Sioux men, women, and children were slaughtered. Later grandpa saw the bodies of the slain, all frozen in ghostly attitudes , thrown into a ditch like dogs. And he saw a tiny baby sucking at his dead mother's breast.The second time around, however, the activists who occupied Wounded Knee were not so many lambs to the slaughter \u2013 they were a people who were slowly awakening to their essential mythic roots.\"Our most sacred altar is this hemisphere, this earth we're standing on, this land we're defending. It is our holy place, our green carpet. Our night light is the moon and our director, our Great Spirit, is the sun.\"The words above are from a prayer by Leonard Crow Dog, and pretty much sums up what motivated the Indians.The Wounded Knee incident had its beginnings during the \u201cTrail of Broken Treaties protests in the autumn of 1972, when Native Americans from all over the U.S. A converged on Washington to protest against injustices done to their community. But President Nixon refused to talk; as Mary says sarcastically, maybe he had more important things to do like planning Watergate. So what in effect was planned as a peaceful protest became a full-fledged uprising, and the Indians occupied the BIA (Bureau of Indian Affairs). There was standoff with government forces, forcing a negotiated settlement which was subsequently ignored \u2013 predictably. But it was huge moral victory for the Indians. And it indirectly led to the more acrimonious one at Wounded Knee.Since 1934, Native Americans were governed by titular \u201ctribal\u201d governments \u2013 who were virtual lackeys of the bureaucrats at the BIA. This system lead to the creation of tribal presidents who were corrupt and tyrannical, and who staffed their governments with friends and lackeys. According to Mary, President Dicky Wilson of Pine Ridge was one of the worst.Following the explosive situation created after the killing of an Indian by a white man in Rapid City, AIM teamed up with OSCRO (Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization). One of the AIM leaders, Russell Means, an Oglala Sioux, was the political enemy of President Wilson, who once had him severely beaten up. AIM members from all over America travelled to Pine Ridge to help OSCRO against Wilson\u2019s goons, and after a time, all of them wound up at Wounded Knee. It was time for the Great Symbolic Act.\"Finally, on February 27 , 1973 , we stood on the hill where the fate of the old Sioux Nation, Sitting Bull's and Crazy Horse's nation, had been decided, and where we, ourselves, came face to face with our fate. We stood silently, some of uswrapped in our blankets, separated by our personal thoughts and feelings, and yet united, shivering a little with excitement and the chill of a fading winter. You could almost hear our heartbeats.\u2026Altogether we had twenty-six firearms-not much compared to what the other side would bring up against us. None of us had any illusions that we could take over Wounded Knee unopposed. Our message to the government was: \"Come and discuss our demands or kill us!\" Somebody called someone on the outside from a telephone inside the trading post. I could hear him yelling proudly again and again, \"We hold the Knee!\"\nThe siege went on for seventy-one days, and left behind two dead Indians. Nothing much again was achieved in concrete terms: but what it achieved in metaphorical terms was enormous. The wide media coverage turned the spotlight on Native American issues; more importantly, it allowed the Indian to look inside, and see himself for what he really was.Mary says, \u201cI was then white outside and red inside, just the opposite of an apple.\u201d This was the case with most Indians. The Wounded Knee incident brought the redness out. Leonard Crow Dog was not a political leader, but a spiritual one: for this reason, he was feared more by the authorities, and persecuted. He could not understand why the government was after him. He did not consider himself a radical. He was not interested in politics. He never carried a gun. He thought himself strictly a religious leader, a medicine man. But that was exactly why he was dangerous. The young city Indians talking about revolution and waving guns find no echo among the full-bloods in the back country. But they will listen to a medicine man, telling them in their own language: \"Don't sell your land, don't sell Grandmother Earth to the strip-mining outfits and the uranium companies. Don't sell your water.\" That kind of advice is a threat to the system and gets you into the penitentiary.This was the reason why the British Raj feared Gandhi and the South African apartheid establishment feared Mandela.***In the memoir, the most effective part is where Mary describes her awakening into her religion. The smoking of the peyote, a hallucinogenic plant which is an integral part of Native American Rituals; the Sun Dance, where the participants pierce themselves but feel no pain; the music which is derived from nature, which the Indian is almost part of\u2026 these are described in words which are almost poetry. The words we put into our songs are an echo of the sacred root, the voices of the little pebbles inside the gourd rattle, the voices of the magpie and scissortail feathers which make up the peyote fan, the voice from inside the water drum, the cry of the water bird. Peyote will give you a voice, a song of understanding, a prayer for good health or for your people's survival.---The peyote staff is a man. It is alive. It is, as my husband says, a \"hot line\" to the Great Spirit. Thoughts travel up the staff, and messages travel down. The gourd is a brain, a skull, a spirit voice. The water drum is the water of life. It is the Indians' heartbeat. Its skin is our skin. It talks in two voices-one high and clear, the other deep and reverberating. The drum is round like the sacred hoop which has no beginning and no end. The cedar's smoke is the breath of all green, living things, and it purifies, making everything it touches holy. The fire, too, is alive and eternal. It is the flame passed from one generation to the next. The feather fan is a war bonnet. It catches songs out of the air.And it is in a Peyote dream that the past comes alive for Mary. In my dream I had been going back into another life. I saw tipis and Indians camping, huddling around a fire, smiling and cooking buffalo meat, and then, suddenly, I saw white soldiers riding into camp, killing women and children, raping, cutting throats. It was so real, much more real than a movie sights and sounds and smells: sights I did not want to see, but had to see against my will; the screaming of children that I did not want to hear, but had to all the same. And the only thing I could do was cry. There was an old woman in my dream. She had a pack on her back-I could see that it was heavy. She was singing an ancient song. It sounded so sad, it seemed to have another dimension to it, beautiful but not of this earth, and she was moaning while she was singing it. And the soldiers came up and killed her. Her blood was soaked up by the grass which was turning red. All the Indians lay dead on the ground and the soldiers left. I could hear the wind and the hoofbeats of the soldiers' horses, and the voices of the spirits of the dead trying to tell me something. I must have dreamed for hours. I do not know why I dreamed this but I think that the knowledge will come to me some day. I truly believe that this dream came to me through the spiritual power of peyote.This awakening is dangerous: because it cannot be lulled back to sleep with the promise of material comforts. No intoxication provided by alcohol will match the intoxication of the spirit connected to its origin across space and time. For the Native American religion is live: its myth is forever being re-enacted on the temporal as well as spiritual plane. The hostility of the Christian churches to the Sun Dance was not very logical. After all, they worship Christ because he suffered for the people, and a similar religious concept lies behind the Sun Dance, where the participants pierce their flesh with skewers to help someone dear to them. The main difference, as Lame Deer used to say, is that Christians are content to let Jesus do all the suffering for them whereas Indians give of their own flesh, year after year, to help others. The missionaries never saw this side of the picture, or maybe they saw it only too well and fought the Sun Dance because it competed with their own Sun Dance pole-the Cross.The Church is afraid with good reason, it seems.Mary Crow Dog, who symbolically gave birth on the battlefield of Wounded Knee and married the medicine man behind that uprising is no longer with us here on earth. However, I do not think people like her will ever die, as long as the magpie cries in the forest or the brook runs, with her gentle laughter, over the plains. I pierced too, together with many other women. One of Leonard's sisters pierced from two spots above her collarbone. Leonard and Rod Skenandore pierced me with two pins through my arms. I did not feel any pain because I was in the power. I was looking into the clouds, into the sun. Brightness filled my mind. The sun seemed to speak: \"I am the Eye of Life. I am the Soul of the Eye. I am the Life Giver! \" In the almost unbearable brightness, in the clouds, I saw people. I could see those who had died. I could see Pedro Bissonette standing by the arbor and, above me, the face of Buddy Lamont, killed at Wounded Knee, looking at me with ghostly eyes. I saw the face of my friend Annie Mae Aquash, smiling at me. I could hear the spirits speaking to me through the eagle-bone whistles. I heard no sound but the shrill cry of the eagle bones. I felt nothing and, at the same time, everything. It was at that moment that I, a white educated half-blood, became wholly Indian. I experienced a great rush of happiness. I heard a cry coming from my lips:Ho Uway Tinkte.A Voice I will send .Throughout the Universe,Maka Sitomniye,My Voice you shall hear:I will live!"}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51489-rebecca", "userReview": "I can't think of a book from which i've ever learned more.

I was impressed that Mary took the time to not only sign my book, but she wrote a note and drew a picture. Richard Erdoes accompanied Mary, and he also signed his name under Mary\u2019s.When I read Lakota Woman in 1994, I enjoyed what I learned about the Lakota Sioux Nation\u2019s people, customs, and history. Re-reading the book in 2012, I read for a different purpose. I\u2019m writing a historical novel, and need to validate any facts I might include in my book.Lakota Woman is just as fascinating a read in 1994 as it was today. Mary grew up as a Lakota Sioux on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Much like today, Pine Ridge was poverty stricken. Mary described her life, but she included other American Indians in her book.She was raised in a one room shack, filled with many family members, with no amenities, much like camping. She described the daily life of Sioux women, and Sioux men, differentiating their roles. Ignorance was bliss for Mary, as she thought this was how everyone lived. She viewed her childhood as happy because she basically had love in her family. Domestic abuse was rampant in reservations, and there were dysfunctional families, as we call them today.Indian children were sent to boarding school to \u2018become white\u2019, to shed their Indian ways and customs. The students were beaten and punished if they didn\u2019t succeed in the daily attempts to change their traditional values. Mary left and became a street smart Sioux, she drank and shoplifted to survive.As every teenager looked for something to be a part of, Mary joined the AIM (American Indian Movement). She was empathetic to her people and other Indian\u2019s struggles and was hungry for knowledge. Mary shared the AIM events with her readers. Not all of it is pretty, by any means, but that is what is so fascinating. It\u2019s a first-hand account of what American Indians suffered in the 1970\u2019s.Mary had a baby during the siege at Wounded Knee. Here she met her husband, Leonard Crow Dog; he was a medicine man and a leader, and also had children of his own. She was a na\u00efve wife and mother, but she learned how to do both well and stood by her husband during his imprisonment and adversities during these tumultuous times.The book includes sixteen photos that illustrate traditional customs, and put faces to names and places. Whether you read Lakota Woman to learn about the Lakota Sioux in general, or to obtain precise facts for your own research, it is the perfect book. It is written on a young adult level, so it\u2019s an easy read that any age would enjoy. It\u2019s always fun to learn history through reading a story such as Lakota Woman vs. a textbook."}, {"userName": "Candiss", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2867198-candiss", "userReview": "I find it difficult to review autobiographies. How does one rate the story of a life? The author may or may not be a professional writer, hence I feel it isn't wholly fair to grade based on writing quality. As for content, a life is what it is and isn't what it isn't - nothing less and nothing more. There can be no \"I give your personal tragedies 3 stars for poignancy but your triumphs only 2, as I feel you could have been more elated. I will grant 4 stars to your what-might-have-beens for being authentically sentimental, yet never maudlin. As for your family, well...I related to your Aunt Mabel, but your characterization of your brother Jeffrey was hardly believable. As for you, I found you to be a bit of an unreliable narrator. I could have done without that section on your childhood battle against tuberculosis, but the birth of your twins was a hoot! \" So...a reviewing dilemma. Mary Crow Dog has done a wonderful job of telling the story of her life. Much of that life was tragic, painful to read about, and will enrage the reader on her behalf (and the behalf of her people.) But through it all, she retains a nobility of spirit, a composure that makes it impossible to not care about the things she has seen and experienced. Her voice comes through vivid and pure. She is regal as she is humble, plain-spoken yet eloquent. She is authentic, and she tells her story with truth and clarity. Hers is a story of great injustices suffered, yet of a spirit undiminished. I admired Mary Crow Dog as I was reading, and I admire her even more now, having finished. Her story deserves to be heard, and I hope it will continue to be read, not only so that such troubles as she's seen might be better understood and condemned to not repeat, but so the culture she is part of might rise to thrive anew. In the pages of her autobiography, Mary Crow Dog gives us her memories, her experiences, thoughts, and feelings - her life, which is all any of us has to give."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1908928-suzanne", "userReview": "I love Native American culture, especially the writing, but this book didn't thrill me. It is interesting from an educational perspective, but the woman herself gets overly defensive and offensive in a way that lacks in wisdom, which would be fine except for the fact that I think she thinks she is being wise. The defensiveness and offensiveness is fine and VERY understandable, but sometimes it just becomes too much - too glaring that it chips away any poignancy; sometimes it's like it leaves nothing to the imagination."}, {"userName": "El", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el", "userReview": "I didn't realize until just now that Mary Crow Dog (n\u00e9e Mary Brave Bird) died in February this year.This is her first autobiography describing her life up to 1977. She wrote a second autobiography, Ohitika Woman, a few years after Lakota Woman, and I imagine I'll get around to reading it at some point too. I was interested in reading this now as I'm winding down on Native American literature I'm reading this month. The other books I've read this month have been non-fiction of a different sort - mostly history books written by white men who weren't even alive during the time they wrote about.This is a book that is modern enough for readers to realize that the United States continue to have difficulty relating to and working with Native American communities. Mary Crow Dog details here her childhood and young adulthood in the 1960s and '70s, about living on a South Dakota reservation, going to a missionary school, and the abuse that was inflicted on her and the other students at the hands of the nuns and the priests, as well as some white neighbors. She left school early on, preferring to become (in her words) a \"hobo\", as she didn't have a good relationship with her mother and her father was not around. Her travels eventually brought her to the American Indian Movement (AIM) where she met Leonard Crow Dog, her future husband and chief medicine man. She was involved in some of AIM's greatest moments, most impressively (and frighteningly) while she was eight months pregnant. Some of the stories she told made me just want to hide under a blanket. I cannot imagine fighting some of her fights in the condition she was in, or even later while she was trying to protect her newborn son.I appreciated the different perspective this book brought me in relation to some of the other things I've read this month. This is the first book written by a woman about women's place in the Lakota nation. In a lot of ways this book is harder to read than some of the other books I've read this month, but primarily because it's such a contemporary part of American history, and one that is often overlooked because most American students are taught that US-Indian relations were peachy in the 20th century.The cover of this book tells me there's a made-for-TV version of this book which I will probably take a look at sometime soon. There's a lot of anger in this story, and I'm curious to see how that translates (if at all) onto the screen."}, {"userName": "Caro M.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7951847-caro-m", "userReview": "Powerful, heartbreaking and sometimes infuriating story of Mary Crow Dog and her life in her own words.

Then it is done, no matter how brave its warriors nor how strong their weapons.\" Cheyenne proverbThe history of the American Indian Movement (AIM) was like a lot of social/racial justice movements, especially in how much fear and loathing such movements evoked from the larger society and from law enforcement. What I've always been fascinated by is the role of women in these movements. Oftentimes their voices and contributions are overlooked or overshadowed in favor of the conventional narrative, but silencing these voices does not mean they will not be heard.Reading Lakota Woman was like sitting with Mary Brave Bird Crow Dog. She leaves nothing out - her turbulent childhood at the so-called 'Indian School' and her rebellious, aimless teenage years. Yes there was/is violence, poverty and despair on the reservation, which made her journey to transcend it that much more compelling. Unlike Ojibwa Warrior: Dennis Banks and the Rise of the American Indian Movement which seemed to me more about AIM as a whole, Brave Bird's voice is strong and it's unapologetic. There's a sense of power in her words as she speaks of the takeover of the BIA building in Washington as well as the Siege of Wounded Knee. It was easy to see how such a movement could indeed empower not just the Indians but re-empowered in some ways, Indian women. And Brave Bird/Crow Dog does not ignore the fearlessness of Indian women - young and old: \"Actually, our women played a major part at Wounded Knesset. We had two or three pistol-packing mamas swaggering around with six-shooters dangling from their hips, taking their turns on the firing line, swapping lead with the feds. The Indian nurses bringing in the wounded under a hail of fire were braver than many warriors.\"Much like Dennis Banks, Mary Crow Dog (Brave Bird), they admit AIM was as much a spiritual movement as a political one. That there were attempts to outlaw Indian religious beliefs and practices, one reason medicine man Leonard Crow Dog was feared by authorities. As far as her relationship with the older Leonard Crow Dog, I had to get out of my mainstream feminist head (a good reason why intersectionality is so very important) and see things through the eyes of a woman whose experiences were far different from mine. And their relationship strengthened her for not just his imprisonment, but for her to become the woman who could speak in front of crowds.I think the one tragic note, and one that still haunts the legacy of AIM, was the death of Anna Mae Aquash, one of the most formidable of the movement's leaders. Many stories, theories and blame abound. However, the real culprits in my view remains our government, aided by law enforcement - so afraid of an oppressed peoples who only sought due process and equality, that they persecuted and infiltrated the movement in order to retain the status quo. We've seen this tactic many times, and sadly will probably see it again."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/968056-paul", "userReview": "This is an interesting and moving book, capturing the life a women in the midst of the American Indian Movement in the 1970's. She describes life on the reservation as a younger woman and details the harrowing and sordid quality of life, revealing the poverty, struggle and rampant racism of her native South Dakota. Moved by the activism of A.I.M., she gives a first hand accounts of the Trail of Broken Treaties and the seizure of Wounded Knee, the 71 day event in 1973, which, though sadly produced no change for Native circumstances on the reservation afterward, certainly was monumental in putting a face on Native populations and injecting consciousness into some who previously had none. Mary seems like a marginal character in the described events, however little that matters, and I wonder how much of the text is written herself, and how much penned after her descriptions by Richard Erdoes. In the end, these details are not so important, as it is obvious that what may be embellished or written up does not remove the clear history surrounding the events, and we get a great inside view from the book. Looking online for more photos I found mostly this cover photo of Mary Crow Dog, iconic, young, powerful and beautiful. Sadly, I found a few later photos (though it was difficult to be sure it was her), in which she looks tired and beaten up.

The author grew up poor on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, was forced to attend one of those boarding schools meant to eradicate Native American culture, and wound up joining AIM as a teenager and having a baby during the siege at Wounded Knee.I don\u2019t necessarily know a lot about the author after reading this book, though that doesn\u2019t seem to be her goal. Instead I know a lot about various people getting beaten up, imprisoned or killed and about political protests and religious ceremonies she participated in. The book was worthwhile to me not so much on literary grounds but because it\u2019s a topic I know little about; I grew up in a part of the U.S. without a prominent Native American community and realized through this book that being native in the Dakotas in the 1960s and 70s was a lot like being black in South at the same time. But most Americans know at least a little about the Civil Rights Movement, while I knew nothing about AIM at all.Overall, interesting book, the writing is fine and accessible (I might have expected more flourishes from a ghostwriter but perhaps he was just being careful to keep it in her voice), and it\u2019s a hard-hitting introduction for those who don\u2019t know much about this slice of history."}, {"userName": "Kiwi Begs2Differ  \u270e", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12287031-kiwi-begs2differ", "userReview": "I learned a lot about Native American culture and traditions from this book and about the AIM (American Indian Movement) in the 70s. Mary Crow Dog explains in detail the rituals and ceremonies of the Sioux, the spiritual values of their people, their stories and legends, medicine remedies etc. Her story is simply (but effectively) told. One might question whether her retelling of the events at Wounded Knee is entirely objective but one thing is clear: Mary Crow Dog\u2019s anger and reasons are understandable, her wounds are painful and the resentment runs deep.Favourite quotes:I was then white outside and red inside, just the opposite of an apple.My best friend was Annie Mae Aquash, a young, strong hearted woman from the Micmac Tribe with beautiful chil dren. It is not always wise for an Indian woman to come on too strong. Annie Mae was found dead in the snow at the bottom of a ravine on the Pine Ridge Reservation. The police said that she had died of exposure, but there was a .38caliber slug in her head. The FBI cut off her hands and sent them to Washington for fingerprint identification, hands that had helped my baby come into the world.I did not mind their being afraid of us. It was better than being given a quarter and asked to pose smilingly for their camerasSupposedly you drink to forget. The trouble is you don't forget, you remember-all the old insults and hatreds, real and imagined. As a result there are always fights. One of the nicest, gentlest men I knew killed his wife in a drunken rage. One uncle had both his eyes put out while he was lying senseless. My sister-in-law Delphine's husband lost one eye.

Meine Gedanken:Es gibt zu viele Stellen in diesem Buch die ich zitieren m\u00f6chte, denn dieses Leben war wahrlich kein gew\u00f6hnliches. Mary Crow Dog erz\u00e4hlt von ihrer Zeit in Residential Schools, von ihrer Zeit als Jugendliche wo sie ziellos durchs Leben trieb, bevor sie AIM, dem American Indian Movement, beitrat. Vom Trail of Broken Treaties bis zur Besetzung von Wounded Knee 1973, die 71 Tage lang andauerte und wo sie auch ihr Baby zur Welt brachte.Wenn man dann noch daran denkt, dass das alles passierte bevor sie 30 wurde - ja, sie hat viel erlebt. Viel Leid, aber auch Stolz, und sie war zu einer entscheidenden Zeit am richtigen Ort. Ich wei\u00df gar nicht, wie ich meine Gedanken hier zu Papier bringen kann, denn dieses Buch ist die reinste Achterbahnfahrt...Man liest \u00fcber die Leiden eines Volkes dem nahezu alles verboten wurde.

Ich finde, dass jeder dieses Buch gelesen haben muss. Ein zutiefst feministisches Buch, mein Gott, diese Frau hatte Mut genug f\u00fcr zwei!

My thoughts:There are too many paragraphs I want to quote in this book, because this life really was no ordinary one. Mary Crow Dog tells about her life in Residential Schools, from the time when she wandered through life aimlessly, before she joined AIM, the American Indian Movement. From the Trail of Broken Treaties, to the Siege at Wounded Knee in 1973, which lasted 71 days and where she had her baby.When you also think about her being less than 30 when all of this happened, yes, she has experienced a lot. Much pain, much pride, and she was at the right time at the right place.I don't know how to get my thoughts on the paper, because this book is such a roller-coaster.It's a book about a People who has had restrictions on nearly everything. To practice religion, locked away in reservations, being lied to again and again.It's a book about very courageous humans, that have risked to lose their lives for sovereignty.Too many thoughts are in my head to get them down to paper. Not only a recommendation, but a obligation to read it. A deeply feminist book, my god, this woman had enough courage for two!Quotes:The traditional old, full-blood medicine men joined in with us kids. Not themiddle-aged adults.

A history filled with affliction and agony. I was surprised to learn how naive I was about American Indian history; the two weeks spent in High school learning about the American Indians do no justice to all the torture these beautiful people and culture have gone through. This book allowed me to see that manifest destiny was just an excuse for the \"white man\" to steal land, exploit Indians, rape and kill Indian women, men and children. The American Indian hates no man, just the \"white man's\" system that committed genocide against them. The system that used unethical tactics to exterminate the American Indian both physically and culturally. This book will having you screaming, angry and most of all happy at the end. Screaming and angry because you want to travel back in time and stop some of the horrific experiences the American Indian had to endure. Happy at the end because this beautiful Lakota Woman has shared with you her story and most importantly, the story of the American Indian.

Crazy. Amidst gunfire, she chose to stay and have her child there instead of leave (she probably would have been arrested upon leaving, then would have been involuntarily sterilized after giving birth as was the typical practice at the Pine Ridge Hospital). I never knew that there had been a civil war type of situation on the Pine Ridge reservation, which was what lead to the take-over at Wounded Knee. Wow. Houses were being blown up and people murdered -- no investigations were ever begun. The distrust, racism and anger that was so much a part of the social movements of the 70's flares up from time to time in her writing, but it's understandable.

It's very hard to grasp when in time she is writing about, and I have to keep trying to do the math to decide what year the stories are taking place.I noticed, both on a documentary I watched about the Trail of Tears and this book, that many of the Native Americans interviewed speak about their history using the pronouns 'We' and 'us' as though the events happened to them personally, versus 'They'.

I don't know her side of the family well, but I feel drawn to our history.Mary Crow Dog grew up poor, on a reservation, in South Dakota. Ongoing attempts to assimilate Indian people to white culture include sending kids away to boarding school, where oftentimes they were mistreated and, it seems, the nuns tried to \"beat the red out of them.\"Mary follows a typical path into alcoholism and petty thievery--essentially what many people think of when they picture modern Native Americans. She finds a purpose in American Indian Movement (AIM) and takes part in the siege at Wounded Knee in 1973, which was a protest against the failed impeachment of a corrupt tribal politician and brought attention to the many injustices perpetrated by the US government against its native people.The siege, as described by Mary, was an almost ridiculous escalation by the government, who armed themselves against 200 protestors as though they were going into an actual military battle. Even going to the bathroom might mean ducking through a hailstorm of bullets.I'm still in the anger phase after reading this, because white people stole everything from American Indians, attempted to erase their culture, and still treat them as second class citizens in their own country. We tried to make them white but remind them constantly that they aren't. We make and break promises. We refuse to acknowledge our part in breaking their culture and we blame them for their own poverty. I'm just about tired of us, let me tell you.This book has given me a lot to think about, and I haven't really even fully processed its lessons yet.

Without a father, and uncertain of her identity, Mary Crow Dog tells the story of being a woman in a fiercely macho society intent on raising warriors. She tells of the historical struggle of her people - the Oglala Sioux - against the United States government, and the abuse she suffered in Catholic schools. Mary Crow Dog provides insight into the hopelessness and helplessness of Native Americans in the United States, and how those feelings translate into such high rates of alcoholism and suicide, and what such an identity among a people does to its women. Mary Crow Dog becomes part of the militant American Indian Movement (AIM), immersed in political action. She speaks with pride about the Ghost Dance and her experiences in sweat lodges and the power of her people. Her story is simply told, and while she explains her experiences with some insight - in terms of individual and group psychology - at times it seems a bit too simplistic. What is clear is that Mary Crow Dog has witnessed and survived unspeakable trauma - and she has told a version of her story. While she is a strong woman who wants to speak out against the abuse suffered by Native American women, she is also clearly loyal to her husband and to her tribal way of life. She feels different because of her half-breed status, but other than stating that she is at all times at outsider, she did not adequately articulate the treatment she received because of this. Lakota Woman is an important window into the lives of Native Americas - into their culture and all the traditions that merit so much pride - but also into the destruction and terror caused by the United States government. The book left me with many questions about the Pine Ridge reservation and the Sioux people, and I hope to find other books that will help me to better understand these myriad issues."}, {"userName": "Barner", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1599543-barner", "userReview": "This is another garage sale purchase. Though at first I was a little upset by Mary Crow Dog's anger, by the time I concluded the memior, I understood. I learned so much about the plight of native Americans, their misuse at the hands of the US government and the importance and meaning of their traditional ceremonies that I feel a deep regard for these people. Even if the book is exaggerated and not quite objective (and I do not know that), it is an insightful look into the lives of important Americans. I appreciate the skills of the medicine men( at one point the white doctors defer to Leonard Crow Dog, Their spiritual ceremonies are moving; I smiled at the suggestion that Christians permit Christ to suffer the pain, and the native American experiences the pain himself. Most alarming are the crimes committed against these people, crimes by our government and officials and so often these crimes go unpunished or even unrecognized. So I understand the anger. I also think that Mary Crow Dog is honest about the living conditions of her people; she rejects the idea of their poverty but also encourages the reader to look beyong the problems and glimpse the inner lives of those on the reservations. She is also very honest about their personal lives, their accomplishments and frequent failures.I do recommend the book.

This is a book based on a series of interviews, then turned into a non-fiction biography. It's Mary Crow Dog's life experiences as a Lakota Sioux woman, as a member of the AIM movement, of being the wife of a revered medicine man and chief, and of her struggles with being an American Indian. It is a recent account - all events taken place by the mid 1970s. And that is what is most alarming and disturbing about the book - the way American Indians were treated, have been treated, and probably still are treated in modern America. It's shocking to find out from Mary that even as recent as almost 40 years ago, Indians were being persecuted and treated as if they were a dredge on society, as if they alone are the cause of what is wrong with the world. Racism abounds in this book - on both sides of the color spectrum - and it's sad to see how badly it can effect whole entire generations. This is a really good book.

It makes me crazy that the only Native American history we're taught in school ends after we learn about westward expansion. There are still Native Americans, they still have lives, and they're still getting dumped on a lot of the time. This book puts it in perspective a little bit. Also, Mary Crow Dog was involved in two of the biggest AIM events of the 1970s the occupation of the BIA building in Washington and the occupation of Wounded Knee. These are events that I just learned about a few months ago from a PBS special and getting an insider view was really enlightening.My only criticism, the book isn't really set up in chronological order so I found myself having to go back a lot to try and remember who people were, how they were related, and when things were happening in time.

People are taught that the mistreatment of Native Americans is a thing of the past, but it is surprising exactly how badly they have been treated even in the past 50 years. It really shows a negative side of our government, one that is causing problems even now. I worry that what happened with the Native Americans is a bit too much like things having to do with Iraq. I think people should read this book and reflect on that. We do not want this particular part of history to come anywhere close to repeating itself. Genocide.

The Lakota are a faction of the Sioux tribes that mostly occupy the Dakotas. After becoming an alcoholic at age 10, Mary joined the American Indian Movement (AIM), a group dedicated to advocating for Indian rights in the U.S. AIM is dedicated to achieving complete self-determination of Indians by Indians (no governance by the U.S. gov). I was generally perplexed while reading this book. Who was the intended audience? There was SO little context about Sioux and Lakota factions, the AIM movement, and her life, that I wondered if she was just writing this book for her Lakota friends and family. Also, the book states that it\u2019s an \u201caccount of a woman\u2019s triumphant struggle to survive in a hostile world,\u201d when in reality it was mostly an account of her husband, Leonard Crow Dog, and his struggles to\u2026I don\u2019t know what? I wanted to be behind this book and the struggle of Indians to overcome white hostility, but it didn\u2019t seem like that was the true focus of this book. I do think the legal issues for Indians are very interesting. Throughout the book, there is a lot of uprising against an alleged double standard where the killing of an Indian was usually treated as \u201ca misdemeanor and went unpunished,\u201d but if an Indian killed a white man he was condemned to death and was lucky to have it bargained down to a life sentence. I think this could be partially true only because of the PEOPLE involved in the legal system (i.e. racist prosecutors who decide charges, or racist jurors who find defendants guilty) and not due to actual statutory reasons.Perhaps due to the overwhelming angsty narrative and lack of details, I didn\u2019t 100% trust the author and had a persistent feeling that she extrapolated a lot of facts. For instance, when relaying a story about a white man who killed an Indian, Mary claims he was originally charged with second-degree manslaughter (which the Indians protested, because it wasn\u2019t first-degree murder) and then was eventually freed without doing any time at all. Well\u20261) she gave us no details of what happened in the alleged murder; 2) there are many legal reasons someone can be charged with second-degree manslaughter over murder (was there provocation by victim? act of self defense by killer?); and 3) it was unsaid whether he was \u2018freed\u2019 just because he was tried by a jury and found not guilty OR because the state dropped the charges.Additionally, Mary repeatedly refers to the time when the white hospital sterilized her sister in the \u201880s without her sister\u2019s permission because the whites didn\u2019t want more Indian babies\u2026we do have a Constitution, don\u2019t we? Equal protection, due process, something? HOWever, yes I realize it could be that I\u2019m a na\u00efve 21st century white girl, and just because we have laws, it doesn\u2019t mean they were followed for the benefit of Indians 50 years ago. I do know (thanks to Constitutional Law class) that in the early 1900s, the U.S. had laws in some states that listed the insane, \u201cfeeble-minded,\u201d and diseased as incapable of regulating their own reproductive abilities, which justified gov-forced sterilizations. I\u2019ve also heard of coercion of minorities/disadvantaged to sign sterilization consent forms after such forms became mandatory. But I\u2019m still torn about trusting Mary.Finally, in the middle of the book, Leonard Crow Dog (Mary\u2019s husband) is convicted for the murder of another Indian. According to Mary, Leonard was sentenced to be hanged, then given 1 month to prepare himself for death (and the judge trusted him to come back to be executed solely on his word). Then, when he arrived for his execution 1 month later, Mary claims that Leonard\u2019s lawyer says: \u201cCrow Dog, you are a free man. I went to the Supreme Court for you and the Court ruled that the U.S. government has no jurisdiction over the reservation and that there is no law for punishing an Indian for killing another Indian.\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Is Mary referring to the case of Ex parte Crow Dog, in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that a federal court did not have jurisdiction over Indian Country (self-governing Native American communities, or reservations) and that there is thus no law for punishing an Indian for the murder of another Indian? Oh, OK, because this case happened in 1883. Also, the case would not have gone to the Supreme Court if it was already the law\u2026the original court that convicted Leonard would not have convicted him. AND I think the 1883 case was modified by the Major Crimes Act of 1885, which made murder and manslaughter, among other crimes, subject to federal jurisdiction\u2026this means that Leonard would have been subject to U.S. law, and rightfully \u201changed.\u201d Can someone resolve this for me? Overall: I might be focusing on the wrong things in this book, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I wish there was more detail about Mary\u2019s own life, because she seemed like such a strong person. I felt like weeping after reading the epilogue, where Mary briefly summed up her life after the heyday of her political activism in the \u201870s\u2026she started with \u201cThe rest of the story is quickly told\u2026\u201d and ended with, \u201cLife goes on.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3433159-nicole", "userReview": "Thank you to Mary Crow Dog for her honest and unsparing writing about her life on a South Dakota Lakota Sioux reservation. Hopefully, it will help others to understand where Native Americans are coming from, and how they arrived at their current situation. Education is key to a better understanding and Mary Crow dog accomplishes that here.Truth!:People talk about the 'Indian drinking problem,' but we say that it is a white problem. White man invented whiskey and brought it to America. They manufacture, advertise, and sell it to us. They make the profit on it and cause the conditions that make Indians drink in the first place. 54A faith you have suffered for becomes more precious. The more the Crow Dogs and other traditional families were persecuted for their beliefs, the more stubbornly they held on to them. 105The Ghost Dance was a religion of love, but the whites misunderstood it, looking upon it as the signal for a great Indian uprising which their bad consciences told them was sure to come. The whites were afraid, and the agents called in the army to put this new religion down 149Everybody's heard about the Ghost Dance but nobody's ever seen it. The United States prohibited it. There was to be no Ghost Dance, no Sun Dance, no Indian religion. (Leonard Crow Dog 154)The original caravan leaders had planned a peaceful and dignified protest. There had even been talk of singing and dancing for the senators and inviting the lawmakers to an Indian fry bread and corn soup feast. It might have worked out that way if somebody had been willing to listen to us. But the word had been passed to ignore us. The people who mattered, from the president down, would not talk to us. We were not wanted. 87-And, this treatment continues, today. In February 2015, members of the Menominee Nation walked from their reservation all the way to Madison (Wisconsin's State Capitol), I'm estimating 180 miles (a 3 hour car trip, one way), in the frigid, bitter cold, with below zero wind chills. They walked, children too. Their hope was to meet with Wisconsin's Gov. Scott Walker to discuss their plans for a new casino, which Walker opposes. Do you think Walker would meet them, when they arrived in Madison? At least come out and shake their hands, welcome them, even if he disagreed? No, he did no such thing. Gave them a very chilly, cold shoulder and would not meet with them. Menominee use Casino revenues for improved housing and community projects. Although, it's okay to have a state run Wisconsin Lottery to provide property tax relief to WI citizens? \"Poverty rates for Menominee County are anywhere from two to four times higher than the state rates or even than the relatively high rates of a poor, neighboring rural county such as Langlade.\" -from \"The Unmet Needs of the Menominee Nation: challenges and opportunites\" 2008 Robert M.

Rebelling against the aimless drinking, punishing missionary school, narrow strictures for women, and violence and hopeless of reservation life, she joined the new movement of tribal pride sweeping Native American communities in the sixties and seventies. Mary eventually married Leonard Crow Dog, the American Indian Movement's chief medicine man, who revived the sacred but outlawed Ghost Dance.Originally published in 1990, Lakota Woman was a national best seller and winner of the American Book Award. It is a unique document, unparalleled in American Indian literature, a story of death, of determination against all odds, of the cruelties perpetuated against American Indians, and of the Native American struggle for rights. Working with Richard Erdoes, one of the twentieth century's leading writers on Native American affairs, Brave Bird recounts her difficult upbringing and the path of her fascinating life.", "title": "Lakota Woman", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60892.Lakota_Woman", "average": 3.96, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440466136l/60892.jpg", "reviews": 296, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/34263.Mary_Crow_Dog", "name": "Mary Crow Dog"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/57267.Richard_Erdoes", "name": "Richard Erdoes"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "History", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60892.Lakota_Woman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15752371-civilize-them-with-a-stick", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1491860.Writing_Women_s_Lives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99419.American_Indian_Genesis", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1004393.Ohitika_Woman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205082-everything-is-horrible-and-wonderful", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
