Live long enough, you're bound to be carrying something.\" Tragically beautiful and breathtakingly transporting, The Geography of Water is so rich in terms of atmosphere and emotive nuances, with vividly drawn characters, I felt as if I had become one with Winnie as she set out to shatter myths and unearth truth. Truth that blurs the lines between what is and what could be, from what wasn't and never will be. \"It seemed to me that if you know all the secrets you would never pick a wrong path. But then I realized people were not the same as salmon, or even whales. Even if there were a map to show us where to go, a foolproof route that would get us home, some of us would not follow it. We would be seduced into other rivers.\"If prose were music, this powerfully impacting coming-of-age story would be an evocative concerto with crashing waves and thundering accompaniment. At the onset, though, it's deceptively quiet and subdued. Hauntingly beautiful, softly suspenseful. Between the lines of subtleties, there are loud cries of brokenness, longing, grief, dysfunction, and torment giving way to savage grace and solace. \"When the anger came it was like the tide, knocking me off my feet. It was just like the times we had been caught, my mother and me, dreaming out on the flats, not paying attention to the signs. Tide came in a series of inconsequential waves, each stronger than the last, until you were up to your waist, your shoulders, your eyes. Water seemed light until it filled up your mouth and your nose and you were unable to breathe. Anger, it seemed, was the same.\" Mary Emerick had me spellbound from beginning to end. AMAZING piece of atmospheric/culture literature. I'm truly awestruck! It's hard to believe this is a debut novel. On top of that, it was indie published, part of Alaska University's \"Alaskan Literary Series.\" Not only is this an award worthy novel/novella, it would make a breathtakingly powerful film. Perhaps, somebody will option it for a movie????? Yes....please do. And please keep writing, Ms. Emerick. You wield a mighty powerful, evocative pen.

The characters are developed as people who could be and are from everywhere. They and choose to stay in these corners of the world and become strong in ways they can't be from the places they come from. Congrats Mary on your first book.

Wind, water, snow, rain - all played their part.

A place with a floor of muskeg and a ceiling of endless sky. I could feel the wind and fog, could hear the dead silences and beating hearts. This is a story of love, a story of fear, a story told with nothing held back about women and men. Families. A mother and her daughter. And the secrets, so many secrets surrounded by bears and whales and the dark space below the surface of Never Summer Bay. Thanks to Laura Walker at University of Alaska Press for suggesting this title and selling it to me. A few dollars very well spent."}, {"userName": "Dianah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3735214-dianah", "userReview": "A gorgeous and rich coming-of-age story, The Geography of Water is not the usual adolescent angst fare. Deeply disturbing family dynamics and unqualified love are the two hallmarks in this story. Set on the coast of Southeast Alaska, Winnie's flight from, and reluctant return to home is interrupted by a sweet spot of sanctuary. Deeply felt and lovingly written, The Geography of Water is a lush tale that feels like home."}, {"userName": "Gail Chumbley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30740968-gail-chumbley", "userReview": "I officially flunk Goodreads. Utter washout compared to you steady Eddies. But, oh my goodness, this book has drawn me back. Grace is the word that best characterizes Mary Emerick's prose. Her fluid style depicts the rugged southwest Alaska coast, as sharp as a as any photo. Then there is the story of Winnie, Emerick's central character who reveals this tale. The girl is a remarkable character, changing and evolving, working through her conflicts. A masterful tale."}, {"userName": "Ann Fisher", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5201512-ann-fisher", "userReview": "Emerick, who has been a kayak ranger in southeast Alaska, sets this wonderful coming of age novel in those same waters. The descriptions of tides, glacial rivers, and hidden lakes are not sugar-coated, but instead depicted with all the power of the true wilderness. Her characters are similarly complex and sometimes equally intimidating. But the story unfolds simply and smoothly, coming to a satisfactory conclusion even though many questions are left unanswered--as the wilderness demands."}, {"userName": "Glen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19249396-glen", "userReview": "Icy family secrets freeze Winnie and her parents from their past, even as they rail against one another in this lyrical ode to loss and mystery. Rural and remote Alaska is as much a character as are the winsome Winnie and her mother Althea and her father Roy. Hovering perpetually in the background is Roy's brother Dean, whose absence is as large as the bear's the family hunts to survive."}, {"userName": "Susan Halvor", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8359170-susan-halvor", "userReview": "Such a beautifully written book, set vividly in Southeast Alaska.

Years later her mother goes missing, and Winnie returns to the hunting and fishing lodge she grew up in to find the world she knew gone. Her once-powerful father disfigured by a bear attack. Her childhood hero revealed as merely human. And her mother\u2019s story rewritten by a stray note.
