He can float, and without his weighted vest and shoes, could end up floating away from earth and being in grave danger. His single mother is very stressed at the thought of having him monitored over the summer, so is very excited to send him to Camp Outlier, where children at RISK can be supervised and have a more typical summer experience. Emerson is less than thrilled, and when he gets to camp, he finds that most of his bunk mates feel the same way. Hank, who has inconvenient invisibility, is somewhat more exuberant than the others, and encourages Hank to throw away his heavy shoes and \"live life\" for a change. The Red Maple cabin (whose inhabitants include a boy with a skunk as a therapy animal, one who occasionally bursts into flame, and one who sticks to things and must wear special gloves) tries there best at all of the competitions, tries to connect with the girls their age in another cabin (one of whom occasionally turns into a cocker spaniel!) and helps one of the boys (who travels through time and doesn't see himself in the future) work through his bucket list. Luckily, their efforts are generally successful, and Emerson has a great summer. Strengths: The author's notes at the back of the book, describing the tales her father told about summer camp, added a nice touch of nostalgia to this. Emerson and his camp mates are all sympathetically portrayed, and the time travel is a particularly interesting idea. The writing of actual letters makes sense here, since camps still don't let children have access to technology. Weaknesses: The boys being hazed by an older cabin and made to wear dresses rubbed me the wrong way, somehow. I can't imagine it would be allowed at all, as badly as many hazing episodes go. I also could have used more explanation for the RISK occurrences.What I really think: This author's The Ark Plan series hasn't circulated as well as I hoped, and I'm not entirely sure how this book would do with my students. I need more summer camp stories, and I personally thought the inclusion of the fantasy elements gave a fresh twist to this, but I'm just not sure my students will agree. Will debate."}, {"userName": "Rhiannon White", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64087135-rhiannon-white", "userReview": "If you're looking for a cross between Percy Jackson, the X-Men, and the 1995 movie Heavyweights, then I think you'll get a blast out of Float! The book follows a group of boys with superpowers that range from awkward (sticking to things) to funny (randomly invisible body parts) to dangerous (time-traveling). The boys meet at a summer camp for kids with their abilities, the first time they've ever been surrounded by people like them. Between the classic summer camp activities like Capture the Flag, bonfires, camp outs, trying to get the attention of the occupants of the girls' cabin (made even more awkward when she turns into a cocker spaniel randomly), and lassoing pigs, the boys also discover that one of their own is hiding a terrifying secret that might lead to someone not going home at the end of the summer. Laura Martin writes a group of boys with varying, distinct personalities and uses stories from her father's time at summer camp to make the book fun and give it variety. It is a coming of age novel set in a traditional setting with an exciting twist and Martin leaves plenty at the end to hint at a potential series. I highly recommend this book for middle schoolers, although all ages will enjoy it. My only complaint might be the lack of racial diversity, but this is still a fantastic book."}, {"userName": "Robert Kent", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3884863-robert-kent", "userReview": "I loved Laura Martin\u2019s Edge of Extinction books and I love Float as well. Essentially, Float is a kids with powers at summer camp story, but told with the same wit and flare for adventure as EOE. The main character, Emerson, has to be tied to things and weighted down to keep from floating away. His new friends have powers such as partial invisibility and uncontrollable time travel, which leads to all sorts of adventures and comedic scenarios. This is the perfect summer read. It\u2019s fast paced and fun and features an adorable skunk named Mr. Stink. What more could you want?"}, {"userName": "Benjamin Bookman", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58298206-benjamin-bookman", "userReview": "A well written story that has plenty to be interesting without getting too bogged down along the way. It is very clearly influenced by other books in the genre, and too similar to feel all that original. But still a fun read, with room for a sequel or continuation."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48544918-thomas", "userReview": "giveaway winner...Thank you!"}, {"userName": "JT", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81325954-jt", "userReview": "Won an ARC.

In this case, Emerson literally floats, tethered to earth by heavy shoes and a vest (and tied into his bed at night). He quickly makes friends with his bunkmates, each of whom isn't quite normal (one can set things on fire, one time-travels, and one could be called the sometimes invisible boy). They have the same experiences many campers have, with bonfires and hiking, pranks and KP duty, and trying to meet the girl campers.
