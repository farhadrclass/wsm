The problem was to work out why the lads all make such a hell of a racket and then when not as many girls turn up they jump on the ones that do. Why didn't just one call and see if he could attract a single mate? The answer is that one frog could make a sound that would carry (say) a mile around him but female frogs are not common and just one might have heard him and might have decided to visit him, or might not. But if ten frogs call the area is expanded a hundredfold and many more female frogs might hear the call and as they are more attracted to what seems like a party rather than one single male, they are much more likely to go. So the male frogs think that they have a better chance of scoring if they give a party than if they just howl out on their lonesome.Seems that frat boys work exactly the same way. Girls walking past places that look like they might have a party are much more attracted to the one where there is loud music rather than the one that sounds 'dead'. Not sophisticated behaviour at all by these university lads but an inheritance from their reptile brains. I love evolutionary biology because it reveals such points as this - when we think we know it all, turns out we have no idea...."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "Quite the satisfying read to take on in the dormancy of winter. It wasn\u2019t quite as pleasurable as reading the author\u2019s \u201cWinter World\u201d in the summer. That\u2019s because the latter was so cohesive around the mission of survival while this one is full of essays and adventures that are so diverse in topic. In these Maine woods, fields, and bogs I am so familiar with, living creatures are very busy with reproduction, feeding, keeping from being eaten, and preparing for winter. Heinrich, in his retirement from being a biology professor at the University of Vermont, engages the reader to hang out with him at his cabin and join with him in his pursuit of resolving little mysteries in the web of life in his environment. As a result he heightens our capacity of be more observant about life around us that we typically ignore and imparts some of his sense of wonder about the ingenious strategies that creatures and plants engage in that helps make them winners in the long evolution of organisms on our planet. He starts with the events of spring we are all familiar with, the early leafing and flowering of plants, the first notable insects, the first songbirds, and the peeping of frogs. He shares his emotions about these discoveries as a triumph over the death clutch of winter, but soon he gets you wondering about why and how the sequence of unfolding of these events is so regular. I wasn\u2019t aware that the flower and leaf buds that open were already fully formed in the prior summer. That trees that flower before leafing are pollinated by wind, which works more efficiently without the leaves; those that leaf later are holding off for the bees or moths to be ready to do that work. Getting an early jump of leafing can be quite advantageous in the competitive race toward the light, but the risks involved are evident when he engages his reader to look with him how a wet snowfall has brought down trees and branches only among the species whose early leafing holds on to the snow and ice.The same kind of risk and reward applies to the timing of arrival of migratory birds. Getting an early start on mating, nesting, and rearing of babies can put a particular species ahead of the game in reproductive success, but if they arrive too soon for this business the food supply of insects or plants may not be sufficient. Have you ever wondered what robins eat when they arrive while the ground is still frozen? Like Heinrich I have noticed the arrival of hummingbirds in New England before there is an obvious source of flowers with pollen for them to eat. I just assumed they made a mistake in their amazing long journey from Central America. Heinrich solved the mystery from his attention to the feeding strategy of a sapsucker (a form of woodpecker), which in early spring makes openings in the trunk of sugar maples. The seeping sap turns out to be a time-limited food source for a variety of animals, including hummingbirds and bees. These examples from the book may not be exciting enough to satisfy other readers. Maybe his weird and wonderful life stories of certain insects will do the trick. When I was a kid, I whiled away my summers reading about and observing ants and wasps. I think I collected about 30 kinds of wasps and was enraptured by J. Henri Fabre\u2019s book \u201cThe Hunting Wasps\u201d. Many of them, like the mud daubers, paralyze caterpillars, lay their eggs in them, and store them in their nests where the larva have live food ready when they hatch\u2014creepy, but amazing. Heinrich explores some of this. The caterpillar bonanza for predation by birds and bugs is countered by disguises and fascinating behavioral strategies of caterpillars to evade getting eaten. For example, certain ones go to the trouble of gnawing off leaves they have eaten so birds don\u2019t notice their feeding spot. This Heinrich worked out just starting from noticing the leaf remnants at his feet. As another case of persistent sleuthing, out his back door he discovers a slave raid by a black ant species on a red one; later he notices red ones carrying black ants and larvae, which made no sense until he kept paying attention enough to make a theory (I refrain from spoiling that solution). Sometimes he does a little experiment of sorts that can be humorous. Such when he notice how a bird incorporates paper from old hornet nests as material in its own nest and gets stung trying to get hornet nest paper to see if the bird seeks out the material to avert predators afraid of hornets. This book makes me hungry to read more of his work to tap into his easy doorway into simple wonderment over nature\u2019s surprises. Besides \u201cWinter World\u201d I long ago appreciated his books on owls and on ravens. I agree with a book blurb from a review from the LA Times:Bernd Heinrich is one of our greatest living naturalists in the tradition of Gerald Durrell; he\u2019s John Muir (without the wandering), Edward Abbey (without the politics), Jacque Cousteau (without the ocean), Ernest Seton (without the talking animals).

Things I learned from the 50 pages I read (and the additional 50 I skimmed) include:* Small birds migrate at night, following the stars* Next year's buds are made the previous season* Wood frog mating is entirely random* Only 1 in 100 larve of the northern forest caterpillar turn into mothsParts of the introduction read like my 8th grade Earth science book, and some of the same information is repeated in the first chapter, nearly verbatim. Chapters are not arranged by date, though most begin with a date: a journalistic style observation about the natural world in a fixed point in time - before the author delves into a topic like dormancy, mating, or nest building, bringing in pop culture song lyrics, pivotal research studies, and childhood memories along the way. The inconsistent chronology bothered me because the chapters didn't have another obvious reason for being arranged the way they were, and each chapter is strongly themed, and could be a stand-alone essay.The index is good, and the selected references appear to include each study mentioned. Hienrich provides excellent modelling of the scientific method in the brief experiments he carries out, lending a strong air of scientific integrity to the book.While this is a lovely gift book for a biologist or naturalist, with it's ragged pages, beautifully rendered and shaded pencil line drawings and watercolors, reproduced in muted green ink, the writing is nowhere as engaging as Swimming with Piranhas at Feeding Time: My Life Doing Dumb Stuff With Animals by Richard Conniff, which I also read this year. An AP Bio student, or bio major who loves nature may really enjoy this book .

This quote accurately sums up the author's philosophy, and anyone who has a passion for nature will enjoy reading this book. Heinrich's narrative is a series of observations he has made of the summertime world around him. He seems to take great pleasure in the ordinary progression of the plants and animals around him. The chapters in the book focus mostly on birds and insects that he has encountered around his home in Maine, but he also has chapters on plants and trees as well as on man's impact on nature.

A great book to enjoy in the summer when birds are nesting, dragonflies are eating mosquitoes, caterpillars are eating leaves, ... He's so observant and a scientist. Did I say a skilled and interesting writer too? I live on 200 acres in the Columbia River Basin in Oregon, and Heinrich's observations and experiments make me notice new things about the creatures living on our property. Perhaps one of the reasons Heinrich is so special is because he is a generalist. He writes about ravens, phoebes, beatles, dragonflies, trees, and so much more. Highly recommended . p.s. you even get some philosophy reading his works -- just enough to get you thinking deeply as you go on your walk-a-bouts. :)"}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9958121-nicole", "userReview": "There were a few chapters toward the beginning that seemed a little slow, but on the whole, a fun book.

My quarter acre lot in the middle of Midwestern suburbia features a few oak trees, a maple tree and several large perennial gardens. All summer long - other than pulling a handful of weeds, squishing a few slugs and drowning scores of Japanese beetles - I pretty much let Mother Nature have her way with the place. As a result, the yard is often teeming with various critters. While there's typically a hoard of the usual suspects, like rabbits, crows and mosquitoes; there are also plenty of more enigmatic creatures, like moths, bumblebees, spiders and ants - dozens of different kinds - about which I know very little. I think Bernd could be the guy to explain all the mysterious details for me. In Summer World, he does just that, describing the various natural wonders he encounters during summers on his two rural and isolated properties in the woods of Vermont and Maine. Unlike anyone I've ever read, Heinrich is an improvisational scientist extraordinaire. Plop him down anywhere in the natural world and within five minutes he'll have found some fascinating detail and designed some sort of complicated experiment to understand it better. One day he's puzzled when he spots red ants carrying seemingly cooperative black ants of another species across the forest floor. Within minutes he's digging up ant colonies and meticulously counting black and red ants to try and make sense of their unusual cooperative behavior.

It's a world of, as Heinrich unflinchingly and even admiringly puts it, \"predators, parasites, hyper-parasites and hyper-hyper-parasites, cannibalism, and disease organisms.\" Ah, summer! Pass the lemonade! The author definitely subscribes to a Darwinian view, so that even behaviors that seem totally nonadaptive or out of synch with the (adaptive) norm for the species are viewed as strategic in the long run -- providing the necessary variation that is selected for (or not). In general, some of the stretches of imagination Heinrich displays in attempting to make sense of peculiar (but normal) bug etc. behaviors, seemed so fanciful and amusing that the human theorizing behaviors really became more marvelous than the bug etc. behaviors under examination! And I had a moment of genuine shock when I read that NASA defines life as \"a self-sustaining chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution.\" So that's what we are! (Can we try to not beg the question in our definitions, though, please?) Along with Darwin, Heinrich is a fan of Edward Abbey's, so there is the occasional lament over our treatment of our bug etc. brothers and sisters here, too, but who can argue with that?I couldn't help but notice that this book could have used some further help from its editors. The narrative (and it is a narrative text) had a sort of patchwork quality, jumping back and forth in time both in terms of years and months. Sentences were repeated, and Heinrich has favorite words that he uses unnecessarily frequently (\"proximate!\"). So the writing could have been a bit more elegant.

He takes you into another world - the world that is around us but that we typically take little interest or notice in.

I also appreciate how he plants little seeds in my mind - usually at the end of the chapter - for future thinking. It's the subtle connections that make me want to read Heinrich. His writing often goes off on tangents, which is my only complaint, even though it usually leads to something interesting.At one point, Heinrich reminds us how humans are effected in development by efforts and surroundings, and he correlates developmental changes in one species of butterflies to the small experiences in our individual lives.. \"Much of what we are and become depends on minute subtleties, and that gives me hope in the reality of free will, and its power if we choose to exert it.\" So, seriously, believe in yourself.Also, in regards to mosquitoes (flies), Heinrich suggests that \"It's better to take hits without flinching, and to develop and immunity to the toxins.\" I would like to read further in regards to that idea and how that works exactly. Only because so many people are afraid of mosquitoes.Then, on life itself - \"But who is to say that oceans of ammonia or methane might not evolve other, bizarre life?\" Honestly, what more can I say, think about this next time you are in deep thought or are high - because this could just blow your brain away. There are depths to what we don't know.And my favorite part, aside from discussing humans themselves and their attraction to hair, \"Any foreign chemical put into the ecosystem..is guilty until proved innocent\" Remember this next time folks, when you want to defend a company's chemical.Worth the read for Heinrich's tidbits alone."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1037407-sara", "userReview": "Heinrich's Summer World takes on the immense task of describing the goings on of nature in the Summer months: how trees and insects are cued to emerge from their winter reclusiveness, how the flora and fauna adapt and counteradapt to one another in the cycle of summer predation, and the behaviors of plants and animals that are peculiar to this time of year.Heinrich shows a very charming curiosity about the doings of even the smallest living things, and describes a number of small-scale experiments he conducts in and around his home and summer cabin to help him better understand the phenomena he witnesses. Sometimes he believes he's made a real discovery only to find that the behavior or characteristic has been previously described in research, but his excitement over the artfulness of living things makes the book really captivating at times. He focuses mainly on summer in New England, where he lives and observes, but makes some brief (and sometimes tedious)forays into discussing desert life, where dealing with heat is demonstrated at its most extreme.

Not everything that he describes is pleasant--cannibalism, murder, etc.--but he tries to understand how the various behaviors contribute to survival. Because of its attention to detail, this is not a fast-reading book, but I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in how nature actually behaves."}, {"userName": "Michael Evans", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6425144-michael-evans", "userReview": "A fun celebration of the sunny side of the year. I find that reading it has sharpened my eyes and ears when I go wandering about outdoors; Heinrich is a wonderful guide when it comes to pointing out things that one might not have noticed before. His interest in insects shines through in the book, as that particular class of animals is placed front and center. There are some wonderful chapters focusing on birds though, and the bit about the wood frogs was fantastic. There were times, in the reading of it, that I wished he would explore areas outside of his native New England (he does talk briefly about desert animals from other places), but in retrospect, the focus on his home territory allows Heinrich to write a more loving work."}], "description": "\u201cBernd Heinrich is one of our greatest living naturalists in the tradition of Gerald Durrell\u2026.A national treasure.\u201d\u2014Los Angeles Times\u00a0Summer World is an intimate, accessible, and eloquent illumination of animal survival in the Summer months from Bernd Heinrich, bestselling author of Winter World and \u201cour latter-day Thoreau\u201d (Publishers Weekly).
