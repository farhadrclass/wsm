Situations where what's being said and what's being done are at odds and places where the postcard picture hides ugly, painful truths. Her non-fiction is the opposite of easy reading: the sentences uncurl slowly, and sometimes you don't quite know where she's taking a paragraph or a page until the last few words, when suddenly everything stabs into focus. And given the length of this book (1122 pages), the time-span it covers (forty plus years), the enormous geography (an incomplete list: New York, California, Mexico, Hawaii, El Salvador, Miami, Washington), and the range of subjects (crime, politics, hydrology, civil war, personal history, social history, and more), you might expect it to be a difficult read. But you'd be wrong. Didion is engaging start to finish, as good a writer at 75 as she was at 35, or vice-versa. I'm not sure if there's any subject she could make dull- if one exists, it's been omitted here. And at the end of it, you feel like she has held up a mirror to our times: fractured, weird, often unhappy, but ultimately worth having lived."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david", "userReview": "This big fat collection clocks in at over 1100 pages and comprises the seven books of Didion's nonfiction that appeared between 1968 and 2003.

The standard review cliches come to mind - spare, taut, elegant, polished, not a word out of place. All true. And yet, I admire these pieces, but I don't love them. There's a coldness at the core of Didion's writing that terrifies me.

Before this book, I had only read The Year of Magical Thinking (which I *loved*) but Didion had always held a certain fascination for me because I had the hugest crush on Ed O'Brien of Radiohead for the longest time and he said Joan Didion was his favorite writer and his dream woman. So of course I set about finding out who this lady was, and whether she was worthy of this praise. :) The crush has long since faded (though I still think he's dreamy) but my crush on Didion continues unabated. This collection is a particular gift to lazy types like myself; I know I would have found it such a pain to acquire all of her non-fiction separately, and in chronological order, so I'm very glad Everyman did it for me. My favorite essays so far include \"On Self-Respect\", \"Goodbye to all That\", \"In the Islands\" and \"Pacific Distances\", but really it's like picking a favorite child. Some essays do nothing for me, but I still love the way they're written. So... yeah.

Ostensibly a review of Tracy Daugherty\u2019s \"The Last Love Song\" (St. Martin\u2019s), a biography of Joan Didion, this article is really an overview of Didion's career and the evolution of her world view. http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/201...The only thing I would like to add is this quote from John Leonard in his introduction to this collection: \"...I have been trying forever to figure out why her sentences are better than mine and yours ... something about cadence. They come at you, if not from ambush, then in gnomic haikus, icepick laser beams, or waves. Even the space on the page around these sentences is more interesting than it ought to be, as if to square a sandbox for a Sphinx.\" Yes! This is what makes her prose so compelling. Even in the early pieces that make me distinctly uncomfortable, like her sensationalized portrayal of the counterculture, or the Black Panthers, or her (especially) wrong headed dismissal of radical feminism, I find it hard to shake off that prose and certainly will not forget it. Of course, this makes it all the more delicious when she turned her focus to the emptiness behind the traditional picture of the American Dream (especially California Style), to the dissection of US foreign policy in Central America, and to dismantling the Political Class in America and their media sycophants. It is the quality of her prose style that places her among the greats of the New Journalism, along side Hunter S. Thompson; it also makes me want to find the time to read some of her fiction."}, {"userName": "Margaret", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5138376-margaret", "userReview": "We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live is a collection of Didion's nonfiction work, including Slouching Towards Bethlehem, The White Album, Salvador, Miami, After Henry, Political Fictions, and Where I Was From, stopping in 2003 before the deaths of her husband and daughter. I got bogged down in the more historical and political essay collections and took a long break after Miami but picked it back up and finished reading. Slouching Towards Bethlehem and The White Album are stellar, with Didion's sparse and biting prose describing the way of life and climate of the 1960's. Didion's essays on more personal topics, like keeping a journal, are insightful and interesting. Where I Was From comes back to this theme and is the later of Didion's work that I enjoyed best. The more historical and political focused ones are less interesting. I'm not sure if I got bogged down in Didion's somewhat indignant tone or maybe the actions of the United States in the latter half of the 20th century are just going to be very depressing. In Political Fictions especially, with the focus American politics of the 1990's, Didion took a heavy hand in condemning those involved. It's justly deserved criticism, but lacks the variety in topic of some of Didion's other work. I'm glad I stuck with this one, and Slouching Towards Bethlehem I would definitely read again."}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1934525-jonathan", "userReview": "This is the last book to have rocked my world. Before this I'd only read \"The White Album\" and upon beginning this book I felt the same thrill that I felt discovering some of my other favorite authors, people like Harry Crews or Dennis Cooper. Didion is quite unlike the writers I tend towards. She's much more a child of the New Yorker reading, grad school attending, fans of Saul Bellow and more recently David Foster Wallace set, if that makes sense to anyone besides myself. People consider her sparse. I consider her wordy, but in a good way. She's got a way for pentrating the blood/brain barrier with her sentences. Her non-fiction has a way of feeling like fiction and vice versa. She's got a way of summing up the crux of her stories with these haulting beautiful sentences that seem to come out of nowhere. I'd say that her story endings can feel a bit abrupt at times though.

She has an eye for the telling moment, against those who are content to be an amplifying or distorting medium for the message, who \"prefer the theoretical to the observable, and [who] dismiss that which might be learned empirically as 'anecdotal.'\"If she has a fault, it's that the sophistication and ironic distance that give her the depth of field she needs to brutally criticize modern political campaigns or the bland hagiography of a Bob Woodward puts her out of her depth when she encounters a situation where earnest simplicity is more called for -- something she noticed when she tried to cover the civil war in El Salvador in the 1980s:I knew how to interpret, the kind of inductive irony, the detail that was supposed to illustrate the story. As I wrote it down I realized that I was no longer much interested in this kind of irony, that this was a story that would not be illuminated by such details, that this was a story that would perhaps not be illuminated at all, that this was perhaps even less a \"story\" than a true noche obscura. As I waited to cross back over the Boulevard de los Heroes to the Camino Real I noticed soldiers herding a young civilian into a van, their guns at the boy's back, and I walked straight ahead, not wanting to see anything at all."}, {"userName": "sam Eccleston", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66974-sam-eccleston", "userReview": "Probably as much Didion as anyone needs to own.

Since \"Play It as It Lays\" stands in my mind as one of the more obnoxious books I've ever read, I'm always a little askance of Didion. But the first 2/3 of this is pretty live. Though this might be a purely idiosyncratic choice, the tales of decrepit Californian rurality got me where I lived (pun!), and I really liked her distaste for hippies. But \"Political Fictions\" is one of the most boring things I've ever read, an imagistic taster's diary of politicians Didion has liked and not liked.

At 1100+ pages and dense topics to cover, it took me a very, very long time to finish this anthology. Didion is massively important to the American canon. I am rather ashamed I never read her before. That being said, while I would implore everyone to read her, I would caution against reading this. We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live contains 7 of her books. While each one is an interesting compilation of articles, reading them all together over the span of 1.5 months was a lot, especially considering the depressing realities Didion is touching on. Slouching Toward Bethlehem is an excellent collection of how the end of the 1960s rocked the nation. It touches on senseless crime, on drugs, on the listlessness that can set in. The White Album becomes more of an introspective. Didion writes some personal essays, but still stays true to her reporting background. Salvador is investigative journalism through-and-through, with some Didion flair inserted for good measure.Miami I didn't much like, I have to say.After Henry sort of drags a bit, since I do not care about the celebrities of yesteryear. Political Fictions was infuriating. In a good way. Nothing has *&$(%*@(# changed in American politics in the past 30 years.Where I was From Is memoir-esque, and I'm sure good on its own.

Joan Didion is photographed leaning out the driver's seat of her car, smoking a cigarette and looking warily into the distance with a sort of reporterly half-interest, half-disgust with whatever she is seeing, and if you've read Joan Didion you know this is the perfect photograph because: she is probably in California, she is in the driver's seat of a car, the make of which I don't know enough about cars to guess, and driving, and cars, and California are things that surface again and again in her writing; and you look at the photograph and think you want to be her, because then you would have the reporter's calmness and cool, you would write authoritative sentences on sixties culture and Latin American dictatorships, but then you think it might not be fun to be Joan Didion because the whole enterprise might just be anxiety-making. I read and reread her work whenever I don't know what else to read, and many of these essays I have read several times, though I would not recommend reading her when you are in a particularly anxious state of mind. I read Sentimental Journeys, about rape, race, and New York fantasies with renewed interest, especially since 1989 began to resemble 2009: \"At a time when the city lay virtually inert, when forty thousand jobs had been wiped out in the financial markets and former traders were selling shirts at Bergdorf Goodman for Men, when the rate of mortgage delinquencies had doubled, when 50 or 60 million square feet of office space remained unrented and even prime commercial blocks on Madison Avenue in the Seventies were boarded up, empty...\" I read Where I Was From for the first time and reconsidered California for the hundredth time.

Certainly, Joan Didion is really insightful and there is some very beautiful writing in the book. Unfortunately, way too much of her best work is concentrated in the first two parts of the collection which are introspective, while also having a certain time capsule effect of the era she was documenting. After The White Album, she meanders through the political conflicts going on in El Salvador and Miami in a way that was both difficult to understand as someone not fully aware of all the background nuances of the time period and just generally not nearly as strong of writing or thought on the issues. All of Didion's political writing is kind of miserable to read. For one thing, unlike with her earlier works where she found a way to combine her very personal, semi-autobiographical reflections with larger cultural and political issues, her later work is bloated with lethargy and it is often unclear what she's doing covering stories like this in the first place other than to appease her publisher. When she writes about her coverage of presidential elections she writes with a bemused tone about how little connection she feels to the political process and how out of place she is trailing along with the campaigns. As a reader, you can't help but wonder along with her since the writing is full of jaded, bitter, fatalism more than anything else. As you read the chronological progression of the work you can't help but sense her becoming more and more numb to her surroundings and more and more hopeless about what meaning, personal or not, there might be in any of it."}, {"userName": "Poupina", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1618444-poupina", "userReview": "All of Joan Didion's nonfiction writing on place, politics, lifestyle, and cultural figures from the 1960s to 2003 together in one volume?
