When I pulled the battered copy of Up Island from a box of discarded books a friend had asked me to disperse, I saw the author\u2019s name. Anne Rivers Siddons? Isn\u2019t she a romance writer? Or does she do quick-read shallow best sellers? But reading the jacket flap, I saw the novel was set in Atlanta (I love anything set in the South) and in Martha\u2019s Vineyard (a place that is as exotic to me as Afghanistan.) So I pulled the book and placed it on my \u201cto-read\u201d shelf. Someday I would get to it and have a quick sojourn to places both familiar and unknown.But oh, was I wrong. My preconceived notions were banished as much as protagonist Molly Redwine\u2019s are in the story. Siddons writes literarily, with much grace. Her vocabulary is rich (there are words I used in Scrabble play that I know how to spell, but thanks to Siddons, now know how to use.) Her characters are colorful and wounded. And all that makes for a read that is satisfying and entertaining.Molly Redwine, an Atlanta well-to-do society wife of a Coca Cola executive, has the perfect life: a daughter who has given Molly a grandchild, a son on the cusp of high school graduation and looking forward to university, a father who adores her, and a husband who is hard-working and supports her\u2014he, the only love she has ever known. For Molly, she has the notion that she has a wonderful family and family is everything. But her life begins to unravel when her husband unceremoniously dumps her for a younger, shrew of a woman. Molly is devastated and in denial. But when she follows a friend\u2014for respite from all this\u2014to the friend\u2019s summer home on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Molly sees a place to hide. She decides to stay the winter, and she soon encounters an aging, sick Portuguese woman; the woman\u2019s bed-ridden, child-like cousin; and the woman\u2019s one-legged, cantankerous son. Add to the mix Molly\u2019s father, who comes to stay a while, and a pair of overindulged, willful swans. Molly\u2019s post-husband life becomes full and almost unmanageable, but it forces her to confront her notion of what family really is.Siddons is a superb storyteller, crafting a coming of age story for the middle aged set. I read a lot of young adult novels, which quite often tell of a teen\u2019s ripening into adulthood. But here Siddons confronts Molly Redwine\u2019s stunted growth at middle age, and through her machinations, brings the character, finally, into adulthood. It is masterful. And it makes me want to seek out more of Siddons\u2019s books."}, {"userName": "Jan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2073876-jan", "userReview": "I started out really liking this book, but in the end it was just kind of meh. I felt like it went on FOREVER. How long does it take to get to the inevitable conclusion, the one you knew it was going to get to from page 1? Sheesh.Also, I thought the dream sequences with her dead mother were a really bizarre thing to focus on. And the romance that developed in the book was a real head scratcher (although I could see it coming from a mile away and kept thinking, \"please don't get these people together; it makes no sense\").Still, there is a lot about this book that is both poignant and beautiful. And I'd now like to visit Martha's Vineyard, a desire I never had before."}, {"userName": "Edith Le sann", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14672815-edith-le-sann", "userReview": "I've never read A.R. Siddons' books before. In fact, I don't have much experience with this type of fiction at all.I am SO GLAD I found this book. It is so beautiful. It's also sometimes very ugly, very human. It is complex and emotional. The main character is an early middle-age housewife and socialite from upper-middle class Atlanta, Georgia, whose comfortable life goes into a tailspin after her husband leaves her for a younger woman. The only aspect of her that I could possibly relate to is that she is a woman. However, the author has written the character so well that I understood her completely and wholely identified with her at every step of the story. I felt her pain although it came from experiences I have never had. Amazing. I passed it on to my mom when I was done reading it and I hope she reads it too.The only criticism I have is that the author takes half the book to get to what I feel is the meat of the story, which is when the character makes the decision to stay on the island. However, that first half helps flesh out the main character so that you can really understand her later on."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3004736-rebecca", "userReview": "[If you look at other prominent characters--her father and Dennis--they are dealing with the same issues of lost identity.

He used to be a runner even at a competitive level and he used to be a teacher. And once upon a time he was also husband and father. And he still hasn't dealt with what he views as his mother's rejection when he was a child, which lost his many roles in his young life.

She finds out her husband of more than twenty years is leaving her for a younger woman, her domineering mother dies and all of her group of friends is rapidly scattering away. Family has always been \"everything\". She was a good wife (to her Coca-Cola executive husband), a good mother, and an upstanding woman of the community (and all of the clubs and committees that that entail.)\tThe new dominating girlfriend has insinuated herself into everything. Molly can't even talk on the phone alone to her husband. Her son can't see his father alone. When she leaves on a short trip she comes home to find them in her house having drinks and starts getting advice from \"friends\" that she would be more comfortable in a different setting - they want her house.\tShe decides to go to Martha's Vineyard for a vacation with her outspoken friend from the north (a friend that has never really been accepted into Atlanta society). When her lawyer advises her to go along with whatever the husband wants in order to show that she has been cooperative, (and get a better settlement), she decided to stay for a while on the island.\tWhile she was exploring upisland she saw a sign for a \"camp\" with \"small feeding swan\" duties. When she stops to check it out, she is immediately sucked into a new situation. Belle is the lady who owns the \"camp\" (a small house that islanders live in during \"season\" when they rent out their own homes to tourists). She inherited the land from her husband's family who has been on the island forever. She lives with Luz who is now an invalid. When she takes Molly to see the camp, she explains that there would be light duty feeding the swans, getting them groceries and occasionally taking them to doctor's appointments. There is also the matter of her son who is living in the other \"camp\" house. Dennis has just had his leg amputated because of cancer.\tThe small house is terribly rundown and Molly decides she isn't going to take them up on their offer until Belle convinces her to at least give them a few days and see how they have fixed it up. The house is totally transformed with everything washed and clean, even food in the refrigerator and wood ready to burn. It looks like the ideal place to recover and rest from her situation in Atlanta.\tShe immediately finds out that the situation is far from ideal. The swans hate her, Dennis knows he needs someone but is still angry about his situation - he also hasn't spoken to his mother in decades. Belle is a walking heart attack waiting to happen. Luz is an invalid with the mind of a child. Molly's newly widowed father is totally depressed and an \"intrusion\" on his son's life in Boston.\tShe calls her father and tells him she really needs a little help and he comes to visit her. He immediately bonds with the swans and gets along with Dennis. They all fall into a comfortable routine, until several things happen.\tThe female swan is killed and since swans mate for life, the male becomes very depressed and disappears. This sends the father into a further depression and all he wants to do is sleep. The two old ladies need a lot more care and the winter is getting worse. Molly becomes overwhelmed and Dennis steps in and reconciles with his mother, then Belle has a heart attack and dies.\tMolly sees that her old family and way of life have moved on and she has become a part of a strange new family.\tSide note: the male swan returns with a new mate - its the start of a renewal for her father too."}, {"userName": "Hilary", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7115361-hilary", "userReview": "I found this book in a charity shop and reckon I got the book deal of the year. It was one of 'two for \u00a31.25' and I don't remember better value for money. I loved it and as a bonus it was in great condition!An author new to me, Anne Rivers Siddons told the story beautifully. I love words and phrases in their own right not just as part of a story, as I guess most readers do and there was so much here in which to delight. The characters were real, flaws and all. From the discovery and shock of infidelity in the first few pages to the fallout from that, not just for Molly but for extended family and friends, the mix of poignancy, pathos and humour was spot on. The wonderful descriptions of land, sea and skyscapes set me down in New Hampshire with a fascinating, albeit motley, collection of humanity. The sense of 'place' was very strong throughout.This is a book of two parts. The first shorter part, set in socially upmarket, corporate world Atlanta. The second longer, in a frugal, simpler but demanding life on Martha's Vineyard. The in-between, transitional chapters which could have been flat, were saved for me by the quality of the writing, that sense of being there and again, the poignancy of feelings expressed, exposed and trodden on. An example: The conversation overheard by Molly, between Molly's 'best friend' from Atlanta and other guests at a party on The Vineyard also attended by the Clintons. Disloyalty and betrayal unwittingly but cruelly demonstrated to a vulnerable friend - ouch!I have just looked at other reviews and can see how some readers felt that the characters were weak, or self absorbed but I feel that everyone deals with life's blows and disappointments in the way their personality and character dictates. Whilst I couldn't personally identify with any of them, I totally bought into them and their struggles. If the ending was rather predictable and there was a little bit of whimsy associated with the dreams and the swans, it didn't matter one iota to me, I found Up Island a thoroughly engrossing read."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4427991-mary", "userReview": "Molly Bell Redwine has had the mantra 'family means everything' instilled in her from early childhood by her charismatic, demanding mother. But in what seems like a single instant, Molly's world is tilted on its axis and she is shaken to her very core by the aftermath. When her husband of more than twenty years leaves her for a much younger woman, Molly's world crumbles around her. She is devastated to learn that the \"Other Woman\" has stepped in to Molly's life and essentially replaced her - moving into Molly's house, taking over her social position and earning the affection of Molly's son.With the death of her domineering mother, Molly is truly set adrift in the world. Seeking refuge with a friend in Martha's Vineyard, Molly begins to search for her own identity. When her friend departs, she decides to stay in Martha's Vineyard by herself. Molly rents a small cottage, assuming the duties of caretaker for two cantankerous elderly women who share a haunting secret, the gravely ill and estranged son of one of those women, and a pair of territorial swans.As Molly's stay on Martha's Vineyard widens the distance between her and her old life in Atlanta, she learns to let go of her outdated notions of family and becomes part of a different - but still very real - new family. As winter closes in on Martha's Vineyard, Molly struggles to nurture them and looks forward to a more hopeful future.I really enjoyed reading Up Island. In my opinion, Anne Rivers Siddons is a truly great author - she really draws the reader into the story, and they are captured by a desire to know what happens next. I vaguely remember reading this book before several years ago, but I couldn't really remember most of the plot, so it was like reading an entirely new book for me. I give Up Island by Anne Rivers Siddons an A+! and will place it on my keeper shelf to read again."}, {"userName": "Marleen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1616365-marleen", "userReview": "There were parts of this book that I hated, and parts that I loved. Up Island doesn\u2019t leave me unmoved, that\u2019s for sure! I thank the author for bringing to life such genuine characters. Honestly, almost everyone in this story is either irritating or selfish, na\u00efve, mean, sad, depressing, spiteful \u2013 and I can go on and on.. Except at the end, those few Ponders who come to Molly's aid, finally to assist her in caring for their own estranged relatives \u2013 a bit late, but nevertheless \u2013 they felt more like normal down-to-earth people. Molly\u2019s father fit right into that category. A good egg. So is Molly. She has a heart of gold really, but she doesn't know it because she has such a distorted image of herself. Her mother was the cause of that, of course. You\u2019ll have to read this to understand.So what was the allure of this book? The real-feel of the events occurring, for one, and the authentic characters for another, certainly \u2013 and I think that\u2019s what will stay with me most. Oh, How my anxiety piqued when reading how poor Molly was betrayed by her cavalier husband of so many years \u2013 and that Sherri-woman he hooked up with! That horrible Sherri felt so entitled \u2013 What a cow. The situation pained me so much. I guess you got it: This is NOT your typical feel-good book, far from it. But in the end you get away with a positive vibe, nonetheless.Part of the story is set on the east-side of Martha\u2019s Vineyard which islanders call Up Island. It felt beautiful and again, a bit depressing: that long winter, brrrrrr \u2013 I felt the cold coming of the page. Some other reviewers are right when they say this book is mostly about finding your identity, but it is also about scratching the surface and getting to know your loved-ones a bit better. If you don't need your stories neatly tied up with little bows on top, then this is a read for you."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/888138-suzanne", "userReview": "Summer read with a predictable plot about a southern woman whose husband leaves her for a younger version. She spends the summer recovering and rebuilding her life on Martha's Vineyard with many references to a thinly disguised Chappy Beach Club, Edgartown and Vineyard life in general. Siddons is a good writer and her prose and plot lines are engaging.  My favorite part of the book was the reference to the swans Up Island near Chilmark where she spends the winter. Swans mate for life. The female swan can no longer fly due to some kind of injured wing hence they winter over on a pond near the main character's winter home. The descriptions and imagery of the swans, winter life on a frozen pond and what it really means to mate for life I found memorable. I have never looked at swans the same way since."}, {"userName": "Cat Treadwell", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7497811-cat-treadwell", "userReview": "This book does indeed stay with you. At first, it seems like a standard tale of a woman\u2019s failed marriage and her quest for meaning\u2026 but then it quickly moves deeper, following that quest, but proving how each and every character is hiding something from themselves, for various reasons.Depression, pain and love are all major themes covered in depth, and it has made me think about all three, a fact which alone makes it more than worth reading. The beautiful Southern style of realism versus romance makes the journey that much more palatable \u2013 even when you despise some of the characters, you are still trying to figure out how this unusual story will continue, as with the main character\u2019s life itself."}, {"userName": "Rita", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3776133-rita", "userReview": "Excellent book about the re-defining of family, from one extreme to another."}, {"userName": "Masteatro", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7109957-masteatro", "userReview": "Llegu\u00e9 a este libro por casualidad gracias a su localizaci\u00f3n en la pintoresca Martha's Vineyard.Es una novela que habla de much\u00edsimas cosas: la familoa, el matrimonio, la maternidad-paternidad, el fracaso matrimonial, la soledad, la depresi\u00f3n, el duelo, la enfermedad, la vejez, la amistad, los procesos de recuperaci\u00f3n, la a\u00f1oranza, el empezar de cero... \u00bfsigo?Ha sido uan lectura muy agradable y tambi\u00e9n dura y conmovedora en ocasiones.

I love the world she takes me to. This is the second book of hers I've read and I plan to read a lot more. I like the way she contrasts the development of the seasons and nature with her story and characters. The main character, Molly, was entirely believable to me. I've known women like her - the author's description of her denial behavior in coping with the difficulties she encounters is so real. Molly drove me crazy in places because it was obvious there were things happening, but Molly just chose not to deal with it - reminded me of my mother. But, I care about Molly and identify with her losses. Siddons characters are multi-dimensional. The swans were an important part of the story for me. I love all birds to begin with and knew that swans mate for life and they are very precious birds. Family being an important plot of this story, the swans were perfect for representing the quality of fidelity. I loved the relationship between Molly's father, Tim, and the swans. I couldn't understand why Molly didn't have that same sensitivity. There were a few places that I feel the author left hanging - like the mention of Molly cutting Dennis's hair, but she never did? Or, the bed sores of Luz that got treated and mentioned only once? That was part of the ongoing demands on Molly and I kept waiting to get to the part of some resolution on these two issues. But, that's just a small part of the story. I learned more about Martha's Vineyard. I had no idea they still had \"wild\" places on the Vineyard. I loved visiting it vicariously in this story. I do like the way the story ended. The maturity on Molly's part through this story is shown in the ending."}, {"userName": "Joshua", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28983544-joshua", "userReview": "Starts out as the typical blue-print for a contemporary novel; Suburban wife is left by husband, runs off to vineyard to lick her wounds and find inner healing.

Although this is marketed as a beach read, and follows many of those tropes, it tackles a lot of darker subjects. Especially grief and death. I really appreciated the diversity in the characters and their intimate struggles, It was refreshing.It also helps that Mrs Siddons is a very good writer, Its very easy but eloquent reading.

The plot is one that is not surprising, some of the characters are rather grotesque on first meeting, but the general idea of putting aside one's pain (loss of spouse, divorce, illness) by thinking of others is a good one. The dreams Molly has about her dead mother did not strike me as real at all, but the other configurations I could believe.
