Neely just can't \"taste\" her personality and choose the perfect flavor for the bride. There is something familiar for Neely about the venue the bride chooses, but she can't place it.THE MEMORY OF LEMON has familiar characters and brings the warmth of the characters back as we share Neely's life as a baker who knows what flavor cake and icing you are, as a woman getting a divorce, as a woman who is in charge of carrying for her grandmother, as a woman whose father wants to reconnect after 20 years, and as a woman who wants to reconnect with her childhood sweetheart.I enjoyed reconnecting with the characters. The book can be read as a stand alone, though.THE MEMORY OF LEMON is another sweet read but also a read that has some not-so-sweet aspects for Neely.ENJOY when you read THE MEMORY OF LEMON. My not-perfect rating is because the flashbacks were a bit confusing. 4/5This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by the publisher in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Karla", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1892765-karla", "userReview": "I usually love books with symbolisms but this book had waaaayyyy too many for me. The Memory of Lemon is about a young woman who owns a bakery and can help brides with their wedding cakes by seeing \"visions\" through tastes. Okay, lemon conjures up memories. That I like. She is going through a divorce from a famous football player who wants to take her bakery. And her estranged dad is a Viet Nam vet who sees visions of dark indigo ink. And she sees visions in her coffee lattes foam every morning trying to turn conjure up meanings in them. There is also a backstory that takes place during the depression era where spicebush (citrus and spice) are woven through the story and a violin passed through the years tingles the arm and fingers to bring out ghostly visions of past members of the family. The problem with the weave? It went back and forth so many times and was so disjointed with so many characters that most of the time I just wanted my own vision to tell me this story would end."}, {"userName": "Arlena", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6139982-arlena", "userReview": "Title: The Memory of LemonAuthor: Judith FertigPublication: BerkleyReviewed By: Arlena DeanRating: FourReview:\"The Memory of Lemon\" by Judith FertigMy Thoughts...I found this read quite a interesting one as the reader finds Claire [Neely] Davis not only have the favor for being a pastry chef but also has plenty on her plate such as: 'a divorce, her father that is suffering from PTSD from the Vietnam War, her grandmother who is suffering from Alzheimer's and then their is a mother/daughter situation over a impending wedding.'By Claire having the 'special gift' coming from her grandmother and father...the author gives the reader quite a interesting story that will keep your attention. I really enjoyed learning about herbs, lemons, scents, flavors and even especially those wonderful pies.The characters were all well developed, defined and portrayed giving the readers a good read. I found that as Claire [Neely] goes through some 'long buried secrets about' her past in the end the readers will see how there is a healing process that will come about allowing her to be able to move on with her life and most of all this definitely 'illustrates how the sweet and sour in life often combines to make the most delicious memories.'"}, {"userName": "Sheena", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5122131-sheena", "userReview": "I loved the Cake Therapist and was excited to read The Memory of Lemon from Judith Fertig.

These come to her in visions and helps her to read a person better to pinpoint what would suit them best.Except she's about to face a mother and daughter duo that will prove quite difficult. Especially when Neely's ability seems to fail her. Throughout this interesting book, we have many stories that are twined together and it will often slip back to the late 1800s. The interesting concept being that taste/scent can transport a being into a different time, pick up on a memory and experience something is really the main premise of this book. It does just that, with each chapter Fertig does well to pull you into the present as well as the past times, with the scent, taste, food, and experiences. She does well to deliver emotion, too.The characters are well developed and their stories are not forgotten because everyone's story is important and there is a reason behind them, which is what we learn, too. I was able to connect with all of them, the frustration, the sadness, and heartbreak. As the story winds on, we do begin to know the depth behind each family from the past to present and during this time Neely experiences some frustrating moments, heartbreaking ones too, but also breaks through. By the end, I had a solid connection to all of the characters as well as the story. This was really a fantastic, quick read.

Neely is an exceptional pastry chef; not only because of the results she can produce but also because of her remarkable flavor intuition. It's an ability that allows her to tap into the emotions of her clients, creating confections that are not only tempting and delicious but also personal and memorable. However, Neely may have met her match in Lydia and her mom, Cadence. It seems as though the bride-to-be and her high-society mom are immune to every sweet offering Neely puts forth.But The Memory of Lemon is more than a story about a cake maker and her clients. It's also about Neely creating her own way forward after leaving her unfaithful husband, Luke. Neely dreams of a successful business, the ability to care for her grandmother, who is residing in a care facility, a new start for new love with an old flame, and the chance to reconnect with the father who left her life when she was a teenager. I took my time with this book. It's true that I didn't find it to be a spellbinding and compelling can't-put-it-down novel. However, what The Memory of Lemon lacks in a page-gurning sense of reading urgency, it makes up for in a quiet, understated grace. This is a story that doesn't demand to be read so much as it tempts and entices readers with a lingering feeling of curiosity to discover what's after the next turn of the page. What author Judith Fertig does so well is weave together strands of the page with threads of the present to create a stunning view of the future. Her stories feel immersive and intimate; they are expertly created gifts for readers and, as such, are not to be missed."}, {"userName": "Michelegg", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/253691-michelegg", "userReview": "I adored this book.

And I was such a fan of those \"gifted\" moments.I will admit to getting a little lost in the moments of the past and how they all connected to Neely but it ended in such a way that there was closure and it all made sense.

She is no ordinary baker, her flavor combinations are nothing short of magical and she seems to have the uncanny ability to know exactly what flavor will touch her customer\u2019s souls. She can \u201ctaste\u201d the flavor of her customer to know what the right combination is for their baked delight.Neely has taken on a large high-end wedding short notice and is having nothing but problems. She\u2019s dealing with a free-spirited bride and her very overbearing mother. She can\u2019t get a read on either one of them and is having a terrible time trying to help them choose the perfect wedding cake. To add to this, she\u2019s going through a messy divorce, re-kindling an old romance and her absentee father has started mailing her again after nearly two decades.The story was well written and her interactions between the bride and her mother and all of the supporting cast was believable and genuine. Neely was a very solid character and you could easily feel a connection to her, as well as the other supporting characters in her life from Ben, her old flame to Maggie, her employee at the bakery. They are, for the most part, well-thought and well put together characters, ones you could see yourself running into if you visited her hometown.I wasn\u2019t as much of a fan of the back and forth that the story took between Neely and back through her ancestry, showing where her gift of \u201ctaste\u201d comes from. For me, it did take away from the story a little too much to be abruptly thrown back in time to a different person and place, seemingly at random and sometimes it didn\u2019t seem to have a real connection with what was going on in Neely\u2019s world.I also saw a few loose ends that never did get tied off and left me feeling a little unsatisfied. If the author is going to be doing a follow up book to this one, I guess it would make sense. If not, there are a few threads that could be snipped without doing any damage to the story. But I still liked the story and the characters and I am definitely going to pick up other works by Judith Fertig to see if there are more adventures with Neely and her wonderful gift."}, {"userName": "Viviane Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2682057-viviane-crystal", "userReview": "Clare \u201cNeely\u201d Davis is back in this second novel (stand-alone) with her delightful gift of sensing flavors of taste that match people\u2019s predominant emotions. They flow freely and easily most of the time but not in this particular story as she attempts to plan a wedding cake for a mother and daughter at loggerheads over the final decision. The mother used to be poor and struggling but married a man with drive who created a business that has made them rich; Mrs. Stidham is determined never to return to that hard, cold place and so her daughter, Lydia\u2019s desire for a Kentucky hillbilly wedding is perceived by the mother as horrific. Neely knows there\u2019s no happy in-between place here so decides to travel to Kentucky to see what she can sense there that can fill the gap for a wedding to please mother and daughter. The story then begins to flip back and forth between the past and present, albeit with too many confusing characters, as we enter another story that has shaped many lives but also been a source of healing that might just be connected to Neely\u2019s past as well.Another story develops in a very graceful way that adds mystique and compassion to the story, that of Neely\u2019s father, who had turned to drink and desertion after the Vietnam War and is now facing his own demons through the help of the Veterans Hospital. It\u2019s a potent and poignant tale he gradually reveals through letters to Neely and she in turn must learn to deal with her own memories. Forgiveness isn\u2019t easy but must be attempted by those who mature.Add another level of conflict with Neely\u2019s problems divorcing her ex-husband who seems to enjoy the hold he has over her due to their pre-nuptial agreement. She could lose everything she has built in her business and so must deal with this annoying reality oh so carefully. At the same time her attraction to another man, Ben, just be put on hold until Neely is fully divorced. The question is whether or not Ben will wait for that finale.All in all, The Memory of Lemon\u2026 is a very nice read.

The descriptions of food were lyrical. The offerings of Neely's (the main character) Rainbow Cake bakery made me want to visit and see the wonderous things the author described so beautifully.Neely is an engaging and gentle protagonist. As a reader, I knew I would like Neely and wished her the best. Yes, I know she's a fictional character but I enjoy books with likable characters!The author told a lot of the story with flashbacks/visions of past times. I am not a big fan of this technique but it seemed to work fairly well in this novel. I felt the number of characters introduced through the visions was a bit ambitious.It is a relaxing, enjoyable read and I was fascinated with some of the background material especially about the spiceberries and scented geraniums and found myself investigating those topics through Google. This was an added and unexpected bonus.With all the delicious treats described, I had hoped for more than one recipe (and that was written in 1800's style).

The characters in the book were (mostly) likable, and despite touching on some tough subjects, this primarily felt like a light-hearted read. Neely, the bakery owner, was especially appealing for me - sensitive and generous of spirit. The descriptions of her bakery and her relationship with her employees made the book for me.Having been married in a bakery myself, I loved the bakery setting, and the wedding planning. The slightly mystical overtones were well done. My rating would have been a full four if I didn't feel the description of the growing relationship with Ben was a little flat.*Edited to add: After writing my review here, I went to Judith Fertig's blog, and happened to find the post she'd labeled as a sneak peek of The Memory of Lemon.

I really enjoyed this book and the story. The writing was beautiful. In particular, the descriptions of the smells and tastes were evocative. I would imagine that describing a taste or smell is incredibly difficult, but Ms. Fertig did so with such poetic prose. I felt like I could taste every smell and smell every taste. As beautiful as the writing is, I almost gave up on the book a couple of times. I felt like some of transitions between the flashbacks and the present were a bit clunky. The stories themselves were beautifully written and kept me engaged, but it was how they fit together that felt a bit disjointed. I loved how she was able to tie the stories together ultimately and thought that the ending was very well done. It was just those transitions between the stories that were a bit difficult to follow...particularly in one section where she was discussing about four generations of women in rapid succession.

Personally I found this is not a book that you can dip into and out of for 10 minutes a day. When my time made me dip, I found I had to re-read parts of the book to make the needed connections. The author did a fine job telling a unique story."}, {"userName": "RumBelle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40306453-rumbelle", "userReview": "This book was magnificent. With each book, Claire's story develops and grows. I love her abilities to sense emotions as taste and to follow that through with memories, it is such a unique and creative plot point. Her friends, both at Rainbow Cake and outside it are such a quirky and eclectic cast of characters. Ro and Jett are my two favorites. I also truly enjoy how, with each book, Fertig interweaves elements of Claire's present day life, and her families history, to piece together full, rich narratives. I cannot wait for her next book."}], "description": "The author of The Cake Therapist returns with another sweet and emotional tale featuring Neely, the baker with a knack for finding exactly the right flavor for any occasion... \u00a0A crisp tang of citrus that is at once poignant and familiar, sharpening the senses and opening the mind to possibilities once known and long forgotten...\u00a0 Claire \u201cNeely\u201d Davis is no ordinary pastry chef.
