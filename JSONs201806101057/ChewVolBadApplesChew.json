I suppose it had to happen, no series is flawless (except for Jason Aaron and RM Guera's Scalped).The story so far: Tony's sister Toni has been killed by the cibopathic vampire who seems to be preparing for a full-on war, and Tony is out for revenge. Meanwhile the egg worshippers who're somehow connected to the fire writing in the sky, the Divinity of the Immaculate Ova, also seem to be knuckling down for some crazy combat and won't shut up about the end of the world. Meanwhile Tony and Colby are back with the FDA and ready to kick some ass! LET'S DO IT!......except they don't.John Layman could explore at least one of those interesting storylines in this book but chose instead to spin his wheels - that is, do nothing. Instead Tony throws himself into his work so there are numerous episodes of Tony taking on the egg worshippers (who've taken hostages at food places more than once in this book) and he takes them out using the baseball skills he honed earlier in the series (also more than once in this book).There's a tense and abstract dinner scene between Tony and the head vampire who murdered his sister Toni though that's as far as Tony gets in pursuing his sister's killer. Fair enough, if we're saving the vampire for a later climax, what about the egg worshippers or the fire writing - can we get more into that? But no, it's teased that we'll find out about them in this book but don't. The high priestess of the cult pops up more than once, says some more doom prophecies, and then disappears again. It's so infuriating that Layman just won't commit to any one of these storylines, instead leaving this book to be about... nothing.Well, that's not fair, there is plenty of stuff happening in this book, but they're small pieces here and there. The case of the energy drink that was designed to burn fat cells to help you lose weight and instead sets you on fire; the guy who makes ninja stars out of tortillas; Tony standing up to Applebee; and some brief panels showing Poyo fighting a giant gingerbread man and Pengthulu, a Lovecraftian penguin monster. All that stuff is great but they're oh so brief (though I'm definitely on board for a Wild West Chew spinoff!). Also I felt Layman went overboard with the number of food-related weirdos in this book. We go from one per issue to somewhere near 12 in the second to last issue - it's just too crazy and again feels like more wheel-spinning.Colby's subplots aren't that great either. There's the ongoing thread about him and Applebee as lovers which feels like its run its course, but then factor in Director Penya too so that they're this weird love triangle, and that whole thing just doesn't feel very funny really - I kind of wish Layman had played it down instead of going into it nearly every issue. And the whole thing about Colby and Caesar in cahoots with Savoy was a dead end - it ended far too easily for a thread that got played up throughout the entire book.Of course it's not enough to stop me reading the series, I'm committed until the end, but Bad Apples felt like a lot of plate-setting rather than the more substantial book I was expecting. To use an appropriate food analogy, it's like eating a series of delightful and well-made appetizers - and then discovering there's no entree and that's all you're getting.Here's hoping the next book is more filling!"}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13998557-andrew", "userReview": "[Who keeps the finger of his dead wife in the freezer and then gives it to the cibopathic daughter?

It may be a choc full of small details like Poyo's ridiculous spreads or Colby's unorthodox love trio with Penya and Applebee. But it seems like Layman has rendered these good stuff in favor of Chew's 'meeting' with the Vampire villain. To be honest, Vamps never really appealed to me. His panel time for character development is insufficient, save for volume 6.That Lying Cat cameo is so rad!Despite a change of tone, a darker Chew still retains all the fun and crazy stuff from its previous chapters. The growing tensions and mysteries are still worth the read."}, {"userName": "Kaitlin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin", "userReview": "Vol. 7 in this crazy series continues with the crazy but hugely entertaining plotline of trying to find the Vampire. Along the way we follow Tony Chu as he works on various cases to help solve how to catch the Vamp. This volume was super fun and a very quick read (as all of Chew is). I have to say I liked seeing the bad-ass side of Tony as he comes back with a vengeance in this volume compared to how he was in previous volumes. I definitely think Tony will be able to crack this case soon and with the series drawing slowly to a close, it should be exciting.As always it's bizarre, colourful and pretty greusome. Just a wonderful series and I will have to save up my pennies to buy the next volume soon so I can read that one too :) 4*s overall."}, {"userName": "Sesana", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana", "userReview": "Something of a tonal shift here. Only to be expected, after the previous volume. Tony has become a much more grim and driven character. Again, only to be expected. It seems like there will be more focus on the overarching story, instead of more or less random stuff happening here and there with bits of story arc thrown in. There's still random stuff, and I'm glad for it. The world would be the poorer without Pengthulu. But much as it seems like there's greater focus on the overarching story, there isn't much forward momentum on that point. That said, the series is just past the halfway mark, so there's obviously still a lot more to come. And maybe later, in retrospect, it'll feel less like spinning the wheels. But make no mistake, this is some really good wheel spinning."}, {"userName": "Bookishrealm", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27544898-bookishrealm", "userReview": "There is so much going on in this series and I love it!!

After the climactic events of the last book it's entirely appropriate, and as these things go it's been damned well earned in my view.Tony's back to work with his partner John Colby, Cyborg (who wouldn't want to have a supercomputer wired to your head all day? Wait, wouldn't that just be bolting a current smartphone direct to the cortex?), and they're all about getting shit done. Immaculate Ova, the Vampire, and some increasingly bizarre food weirdos give our guys a lot to chew on (I can't believe I never used that pun in these reviews before now - I must be slipping).Guillory and Layman have laid down enough foundation with these characters that they're now free to start playing around with out expectations, and that. Is. Wonderful. Somehow, even as ridiculously exaggerated as this cast is, there's enough heart in them that when they do something unexpected, I actually sit up, take notice and care. What the fuck guys? I thought this was just a funny book. I wasn't prepared to feel like this.Best moments of this series are always hard to choose, but I gotta vote in this volume for Pengthulu. And maybe the contents of the crate. And Senator Eccles. Like I said, it's hard.Where this ends off is freakin awesome. Tony faces a left-hook revelation that should completely change his mission and how he chooses to resolve the avian mystery ('cause you know in the end it's going to come down to him). I (only slightly) peed myself when I saw this unfold - this gonna get good Hoss!A couple of my respected GR friends find this book spinning its wheels, but I didn't feel like that (though I'm not entirely sure why not). For me, this book took a nice serious turn and amped up the tension on a number of fronts. As of this morning (just finished), I like it, and I'm ready to see this series go from \"fun, lighthearted\" to \"these guys are facing some serious shit that's also pretty ridiculous, and makes me laugh while I increasingly care about these characters\". If we get *both* fun and the depth that this volume hints at, I will now down to these dudes forevermore."}, {"userName": "Peter Derk", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk", "userReview": "I don't take a lot of time to talk about the art in comics. What can I say, I'm a words guy. But I just wanted to take a second to talk about how much I like Rob Guillory's art in this book.Amount: One \"A Lot.\"Guillory has a great style. I really don't think anyone could draw this book the way he does, and at the same time as you read, you never get lost in the page. It's easy to see which dialogue balloon comes next. People who are unfamiliar with comics will sometimes tell me their hesitance comes from the fact that they don't know how to read comics. How to know which balloon comes next. I tell them that they're reading the wrong comics.A good artist/writer duo knows that the art has to serve the story. The story has to progress through the art, and as much as an artist might love a splash page here and there, they have to grind through those scenes of two characters talking in a warehouse. Lots of comic book stuff seems to go down in warehouses. If you wanna be big in comics, draw warehouses, docks, and if you can draw a great forklift, you're in.Dave McKean is an artist who, while I think his work has great atmosphere, I have no idea what's going on. Try 'Cages' if you want to see what I mean.On the flipside, sometimes you read something where the art does a fine job moving things along, and that's it. It doesn't blow me away.I talked to a friend about Saga, the current \"It\" series at the moment, and my friend made a good point that the art rarely has backgrounds or other interesting things in the panels other than the main focal points. I see some awesome line work in Saga now and then, but I had to agree. Sometimes the panels feel fairly joyless. Guillory puts little stuff into everything. It's a little bit like a Mad Magazine or a Simpsons episode where every billboard, every food package, every t-shirt is another opportunity to add a little something to the reading experience.Style and skill. Guillory forever."}, {"userName": "Say", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3193958-say", "userReview": "My favorite thing about this volume?

It wasn't  V.C. Andrews or  Cormac McCarthy level upsetting, but it left me with a hollowness that I genuinely didn't expect I'd feel reading this comic series. The books had been disturbing, yeah, but more of a Preacher level madness than much else. Nevertheless,  Space Cakes managed to leave me feeling a bit lost and hollow. Yet still, we travel on... Bad Apples picked up where  Space Cakes left off and kicked things into high gear almost immediately. The amusement, the lull that was present in  Major League Chew and  Space Cakes, slight though it was, is now fully absent. Tony is on a mission, and nothing is going to stop him. Even Colby fully comes into his own and comes through. Olive is now a full part of the story, and the Vampire is confronted for the very first time. You can almost feel the electric excitement as everything begins to fall into place. This is story-telling, and this is a startling pace that is so immensely satisfying after the end of the last book. Character development, confrontations, and a cliff-hanger of an ending I didn't see coming. Perfect.Chew continues to astonish and deliver and I'm both happy things are speeding up since there's only 5 volumes left and this means it will all wrap up well (theoretically) and devastated since it means I'm nearing the end.

Didn't see a lot of Olive here, but Savoy does appear and I'd say things ought to be coming to a head pretty soon.I feel like I'm already wondering what happened, but I realize it really was Chu just chasing the Vampire and shit kicking along the way (there's also some stuff about the Cult of the Ovum/Ova and Tony being the saviour...)There's even a joke about the Poyo/Turducken joke page from last volume, when we (and Tony) are expecting Poyo to show up and help defeat some baddies...nicely done!Ready for Vol. 8 whenever it appears."}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2497528-alan", "userReview": "Chew remains one of those over the top books that I enjoy, but I'm beginning to wonder if having hit around the halfway point (per Layman himself) if there isn't going to be some floundering before matters accelerate towards the conclusion.Tony Chu returns, and because of the previous volume's events Tony is back with the FDA. For some reason it appears his beating and vol. 6's events have sharpened Tony's abilities or he is channeling his inner anger towards catching \"The Vampire\"? Mason Savoy plays a larger role than he has in a while, and Tony's partner John appears to not be as dim as I previously thought he was.I'm not dropping the series, and vol. 8 has some nice character beats (started it last night).

Also, the panel flow in this volume gave Guillory room to stretch out and do some great full page artwork.

Especially not after the masterpiece that was Space Cakes. I'm getting the sense that this started as a very focused story with a clear plot line and then it became a hit and got extra issues so it's becoming more convoluted. There's a handful of different plots, and I have every confidence that Layman will be able to tie them together in a very satisfying way. That said, sometimes they just feel so disparate from one another. In a similar vein, I love all the random jokes, but there comes a point where funny for the sake of being funny will begin to fall flat. If nothing else, those jokes point to the incredible detail of this book. If you can read it, you should. It will be nonsense that fits this universe and makes you smile. Speaking of the universe, it's gotten a bit crazy. At first we had cibopaths. Then they added a couple other powers. Now it's become the main focus of the book, these people with food-based superpowers. It's fun, but I feel like it's moved this more toward being a superhero book than a mystery noir type thing.

Especially with the way the last one ends, I was super ready for action.I expect 8 will pick up all the slack here, because it absolutely leads to it, and I'm guessing there will be a fair bit of offsetting the kooky sidetracking here, but it ended up feeling a bit unnecessary.
