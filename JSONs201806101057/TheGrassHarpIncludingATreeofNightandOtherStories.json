Gonna make a Sentimental Journey,to renew old memories...Never thought my heart could be so yearny. Why did I decide to roam? Gotta take that Sentimental Journey, Sentimental Journey home. Sentimental Journey.\"\nRandom House, New York, New YorkScene One--The office of Bob Linscott,Editor for Truman Capote, Carson McCullers, among others Random House, New York, NYLinscott: Truman, you're a wonderful writer...Capote: Oh, that's so true. There's only one TC! (Truman takes a languorous puff from his cigarette and stares dreamily at the ceiling, then looks at Bob, giving him a sultry look.)Linscott: Don't pull that pouty baby face look on me. It won't work.Capote: Why, Bob, I don't know what you mean! (In a whining tone)Linscott: Look. Bennett's getting nervous. It's been two years since Other Voices, Other Rooms came out. That jacket photo just about made us all laughing stocks.Capote: Now, that was perfectly innocent, Bob. And, Foxy, you had final approval on that picture. Now, didn't you?Linscott: You caught me at a weak moment.Capote: (Waving his cigarette delicately) Well, there you have it, Bobby.Linscott: We've kept you in front of the public, Truman. We published your short fiction inA Tree of Night: And Other Stories. But you've been promising...Capote: And it was a ROUSING success. You were at the reading down at the Poetry Center. I was practically BLASTED off that high stool Malcolm had me sit on by the applause. How many times have you heard Bravo and Encore shouted outside of an opera house? Hmmmm???Linscott: And you hopped off that stool and were bowing and blowing kisses with both hands. Have you absolutely no shame, Truman?Capote: What's that, Bob? Shame? (giggling)Linscott: Truman, you SKIPPED off the damned stage like a school boy!\nHUZZAH!Capote: Well, Foxy, I FELT like a school boy. Why, I DID!Linscott: And don't tell me you're still working on Summer Crossing.Capote: But, Bob, I am. I really, really am. It's just that the progress is slow.Linscott: Really, Truman. What do you not understand? A rich New York girl falls in love with a cab stand attendant?Capote: Love comes in many places. Wherever you find it, is natural.Linscott: I'm sure you would know, Truman. But it's THIN, Truman, THIN! Any author could write it. It doesn't have your unique artistic stamp. Capote: Well, actually, Jack doesn't like it either.\nTruman and Jack Dunphy, long time companionsLinscott: You're not helping that gad about with his novel are you, Truman?Capote: NO! Bob! I wouldn't do that. Why would I lie? (eyes dart left and right)Linscott: For any of the same reasons you always do, Truman. So what am I going to tell Bennett?Capote: Alright. I tore it up. I didn't like it either.Linscott: You tore it up! Truman!Capote: Well you said you didn't like it. I tore it up. It's finished. Gone. Never to see the light of day. Happy? I'm working on something else. Something from back in Alabama. About growing up with Callie, Sook, and Annie.Linscott: Is this true? I want to see the first two chapters.Capote: Oh, Bob! You won't believe it. It's about the lovely years I spent with my cousins. I know how dark and gloomy Other Voices, Other Rooms was. But this is the HAPPY TC. It's very real to me, more real than anything I've ever written, probably ever will.Linscott: That's what you've said about EVERYTHING you've ever written.Capote: (sulking) I cry. I have no control over myself or what I'm doing. Memories are always breaking my heart, Bob. You know, it's not easy writing a beautiful book.SCENE TWO--Truman on the terrace of the Fontana Vecchia in Taormina, on the phone. Linscott in his office at Random House, also on phone.Linscott: Truman, Truman, Truman. This is absolutely wonderful. So, Dolly, that'd be Sook, right? She's got a patent medicine for Dropsy that Verena...Capote: Ye-e-e-s, that would be Cousin Callie. She could be so mean--Linscott: And Verena is going to steal Dolly's recipe to make the money off it--Capote: (Yawning. Jack is rubbing his shoulders) That's right. Callie always was the richest, meanest woman in town.Linscott: So, they run off from home and find a treehouse between two China Berry trees and live there, and Verena sends the law to bring them back, and there's this retired Judge--Capote--Charlie Cool who falls in love with Dolly, and Catherine Creek, Dolly's helper, and Riley, an older boy I looked up to all living up in this tree. And Judge Cool stands between Verena, the law and the townspeople who are trying to get Dolly to go back home and live with Verena.Linscott: My boy, my boy--This is simply marvelous stuff. How are you going to get them down out of the tree? ARE you going to get them out of the tree?Capote: Bob, you'll just have to wait and see. I'm mailing out the last sections June 4.Linscott: I hope you mean June 4, 1951, and not 52 or 53.Capote: Really Bob. You need to loosen up a little. First you drink, then you have sex, and then you smoke. You should try it sometime.Linscott: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Wonderful stuff. Simply marvelous. Now this is the TC I know and love that we ALL know and love here at Random House.Capote: Give my regards to Bennett, Foxy. (hanging up) A little lower Jack, honey.SCENE THREE: Scenes of train travelling through the Italian countryside. A map flashes Florence, Rome, and finally Venice. Truman is on the phone looking out his hotel room overlooking the Canal.CAPOTE: Uhm, Bob, TrumanLinscott: How could I ever mistake that voice, my boy.Capote: Oh, Bob. I do hope you are pleased with the book.Linscott: Uhm, how can I say this, Truman. I didn't like the ending. Nobody hear at Random House liked the ending.\nAnd if Bennett Cerf isn't happy, ain't nobody happy at Random HouseCapote: But, Bob, WHY? I just don't understand! (plaintively, turning into a pouty face)Linscott: Well, Truman, the first half was absolutely divine! I was expecting a continuing miracle! I don't think we got that. Not at all. Capote: But, but, but...Linscott: Not, you understand, that it isn't a good as a story and as superb as a piece of righting. There's no specific criticism to be made; just that we all had a slight feeling of letdown, tapering off a little, with the ending coming to soon. It's so short, we don't think people will buy it as a novel.Capote: I cannot endure it (stamping feet) that all of you think my book a failure. I am simply striken by such overpowering opinion!Linscott: \"We'll pray that the critics won't have the same feeling of vague letdown in the last half that effected us.SCENE FOUR: Review pages swirl coming to rest on headlines as a back drop to Truman Capote sitting in a comfortable chair. Capote holds an Atlantic Magazine.

I love his vivid language, flamboyant characters, rhythmic sentences and bold, fantastic scenes.Reading Truman Capote is like eating cheesecake -- every sentence is rich and glorious. Here's a beautiful excerpt from The Grass Harp: Wind surprised, pealed the leaves, parted night clouds; showers of starlight were let loose: our candle, as though intimidated by the incandescence of the the opening, star-stabbed sky, toppled, and we could see, unwrapped above us, a late wayaway wintery moon: it was like a slice of snow, near and far creatures called to it, hunched moon-eyed frogs, a claw-voiced wildcat.  At its core, The Grass Harp is about love. The Judge says of love, \"A leaf, a handful of seed -- begin with these, learn a little of what it is to love. First, a leaf, a fall of rain, then someone to receive what a leaf has taught you, what a fall of rain has ripened. No easy process, understand: it could take a lifetime, it has mine, and still I've never mastered it -- I only know how true it is: that love is a chain of love, as nature is a chain of life.\"  Dolly elaborates on this thought in the final pages of the book in a conversation with Collin: \"Charlie said that love is a chain of love. I hope you listened and understood him. Because when you can love one thing...., you can love another, and that is owning, that is something to live with. You can forgive everything.\" The treehouse scenes create the turning point of the book. There we have a collection of \"fools\" each trying to find out who he/she truly is. It is after the Judge leaves the treehouse that he has the courage to leave his sons and set off on his own. Similarly with Riley Henderson, it is after he leaves the tree house that he falls in love with Maude Riordan, gets engaged, and finds purpose as he begins to clear land with a plan to build houses.  Verena, unfortunately, never has a treehouse epiphany although Dolly forces her into the tree presumably with the hope of redeeming her sister (or herself, maybe both). The reader realizes that Verena has allowed the longstanding unacknowledged or perhaps unreciprocated love she held for Maudie Laura Murphy to destroy her life. In other words, she permitted the chain of love to be broken. Dolly, on the other hand, has kept the chain of love intact and although she leaves the treehouse to return to her sister, one gets the impression she is triumphant and not a coward.  A beautiful book."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1800787-jill", "userReview": "Capote creates some of the most beautiful sentences I've ever read. His characters are created with so much care, and I love them all, whether they're good or bad. This novella is perhaps the best example of Capote's skill.

It is the epitome of heart-warming."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32887118-peter", "userReview": "It was a reading group that directed me to this book and I am very thankful for this advice. The title story \u201cA Grass Harp\u201d is \u201cpoetry in form of prose\u201d as one group member put it. Capote is a master of painting with words, visible in expressions like \u201cthe snowflake of Dolly\u2019s face\u201d, \u201ceyes \u2026 luminously green as mint jelly\u201d or \u201cthe kitchen was warm as a cow\u2019s tongue\u201d. The story is deeply engulfed in humanity. The main characters the narrator boy Colling, Aunt Dolly, her coloured friend and help Catherine and Judge Cool defy the indifference and callousness of the people of a Southern town and retreat to a tree house. The regular society of the town cannot allow for such an unheard thing and forces them to give up. A young man gets shot in the shoulder, but the event has no other major consequences. Still the people involved come out of it changed.The story reminded me in many ways of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d by Harper Lee. It plays in a remote, rural town, central characters are a child and a judge, and they display the same fierce attitude towards injustice and racism.Among the other stories of the book I liked most \u201cChildren on their Birthdays\u201d and \u201cA Jug of Silver\u201d, both again displaying Capote\u2019s mastery picture strong, exceptional children, their struggles and view of the world. The 4-star rating is only to be contributed to those other stories that were less my taste."}, {"userName": "Myles", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1630205-myles", "userReview": "I am still mystified by Capote's talent. His early novels and stories share a great deal with each other, diminishing their impact, but the ingenuity and wit of the works still shine through. Colin Fenwick was sent to live with his aunts after the deaths of his parents. Aunt Verena is a shrewd businesswoman who holds the town in a tight financial grip. Her sister Dolly is gentle and looks after the needs of the house, preparing a dropsy cure for sale on the side. Dolly's closest friend is Catherine, a black woman who defends the meek Dolly and claims Native American descent.The dropsy cure becomes popular enough to be bringing in real money and suddenly Verena wants to interfere. After a clash between the sisters Dolly, Catherine and Colin decide to move out of the house and into a treehouse on the outskirts of town. Verena attempts to use her influence to make them return home, and the rest of the plot happens.But plot is secondary with Capote, especially in these early works. His language, his curious sympathy with older women and the young boys who hang out in their kitchens, and the humorous and somehow completely believable aura that surrounds the daily life of his story's inhabitants. The Grass Harp has Capote's first collection of short stories, A Tree of Night and Other Stories attached. These stories are more unsettling than funny and owe a great debt to the Freud fascination of the mid-20th century. Only two, \"Children on Their Birthdays\" and \"Shut a Final Door\" enter firm, laugh-out-loud, ground. And that is taking into account my significant appreciation for dark humor."}, {"userName": "alexis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62591-alexis", "userReview": "Capote's Southerness shines in this lovely little book. I adore Truman Capote's work. In Cold Blood has to be one of my favorite books of all time. So it was interesting to read a book that was still so blatantly Capote but emotionally so far removed from the other. Then again, I guess it's not. The Grass Harp has the same sad wistfulness as all of Capote's books but introduces the warm, lazy, drama of a Southern picturesque.I loved this book. The comparisons to To Kill a Mockingbird are easy to make. You do get the feeling that the two books take place in mirror images of the same town, with distant relatives making up the townsfolk. But both have distinct stories to share, and I wouldn't dare discount one by comparing it to the other. It does make it easy to wonder about long summers shared by Truman and Nell though. Highly recommended.Also, if you enjoy the whole Capote/Lee connection as much as I do, check out Capote in Kansas. A lovely ghost story starring Truman Capote and Harper Lee, by Kim Powers."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/890562-peter", "userReview": "The first time I read a Truman Capote story I could have sworn I had read it before.

Yes, there is plot, characterization, mood, beginnings, middles, and ends (although some of those ends are quite abrupt). If his world is, at times, wistful, sometimes silly, sometimes fantastical, often cold, then, all the better because they are made that way through his exquisite use of words--the simpler the better. This is why I read Capote: \"...a field of high Indian grass that changes color with the seasons: go to see it in the fall, late September, when it has gone red as sunset, when scarlet shadows like firelight breeze over it and the autumn winds strum on its dry leaves sighing human music, a harp of voices.\" \"She was one of those people who can disguise themselves as an object in the room, a shadow in the corner, whose presence is a delicate happening. ...Pulled and guided by the gravity of Verena's planet, we rotated separately in the outer spaces of the house.\"\"...the kitchen was warm as a cow's tongue.\"\"...Alaska--well, it was fun for an old man sitting alone listening to the noise of a clock.\"\"...like two children lost in a witch-ruled forest...\"\"...Big Eddie Stover was legally born a bastard; the other two made the grade on their own.\"\"...drugstore slander...\"\"...he was a fat cigar of a man...\"Yes, I know.

I've always thought that Truman Capote is the bastard child of Eudora Welty and Tennessee Williams. This book is definitely on the Eudora Welty side of the equation, although it also reminds me in moments of We Have Always Lived at the Castle.This is a tale of misfits, of the freedom of refusing to fit in, and of what it takes to make yourself and your family. The language is elegiac and the relationships are sweet, heartfelt, and complex. Everyone in this book is looking for love, for a place to be - the treehouse at the top of the china tree brings them all together and holds them peaceful in its arms.There is, of course, the town and its folk who stand in opposition to the people of the tree and who, ultimately, bring the idyll to an end leaving only the shadows of voices on the wind.What remains for me is the image of the kitchen with its smells of sweet and savory things baking, the sound of conversation on a hot day, and the bowl of goldfish swimming lazily in their bowl."}, {"userName": "Susana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8365502-susana", "userReview": "Bueno, yo tengo la versi\u00f3n en castellano, pero no importa.

As great as Mailer, DeLillo, Updike, Gore Vidal, Tennessee Williams, James Baldwin and Arthur Miller.It is easy to forget after the major successes of \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" and \"In Cold Blood,\" the volume and magnitude and beauty of Capote's other works. \"The Grass Harp and other Stories\" is one of those other treasures. The characters of Dolly, the Judge, Verena, and Catherine in \"The Grass Harp\"are vivid illustrations and portrayals of rural Alabama that touch the reader in such a way as to make them unforgettable. Mr. Capote was so in touch with his Alabama roots and childhood that it is easy to forget, while reading this wonderful novel and short stories, that his frame and celebrity was ever associated with New York.Mr. Capote has always been one of my favorite writers.

Collin Fenwick\u2019s account about his childhood and upbringing from this little town called \u201cRiver Woods\u201d were just marvelous, special and unexpectedly profound. It was hilarious at times, entertaining, sad, and mysterious. Collin shared how he perceived everyone in the town, the gossip and the definite events occurring in a \u201ctree-house\u201d which will forever change everything.What I liked the most was the beautiful narrative that was distinct. Through Collin\u2019s narration, the author uses nature\u2019s description to portray the situation at hand or emotions, feelings. Despite the storyline being simple, one is caught up in the embellishment of the narrative.\u201cWe are speaking of love. A leaf, a handful of seed - begin with these, learn a little what it is to love. First, a leaf, a fall of rain, then someone to receive what a leaf has taught you, what a fall of rain has ripened. No easy process, understand; it could take a lifetime, it has mine, and still I\u2019ve never mastered it - I only know how true it is: that love is a chain of love, as nature is a chain of life.\u201d (p.44)It reminded me at times of \u201cThe Emigrants\u201d by the German author W.G. Sebald and \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d by Harper Lee. The title of the story: \u201cThe Grass Harp\u201d refers to the wind that carries \u201c\u2026a story- it knows the stories of all the people on the hill, of all the people who ever lived, and when we are dead it will tell ours, too.\u201d (p.9) ; representing a testament of their existence. \u201c\u2026But the wind is us- it gathers and remembers all our voices, then sends them talking and telling through the leaves and the fields-\u201d (p.23)The focus of the story centers mainly on a few days where Collin with some family members, friends live in a \u201ctree-house\u201d. There, we witness a special gathering, a community that built trust, shared reminiscences and life lessons, practiced acceptance. It became an adventure.Thus referring to the implementation of the notion of \u201cthe grass harp\u201d: \u201c\u2026it was a grass harp, gathering, telling, a harp of voices remembering a story. We listened\u201d (p.97)Nature, the \u201cchina tree\u201d became their refuge against everyone\u2019s discontent thus representing a safe world: \u201cprivate worlds\u201d (p.51), and a place everyone longed to find : \u201cIt may be that there is no place for any of us. Except we know there is, somewhere; and if we found it, but lived there only a moment, we could count ourselves blessed. This could be your place,\u201d (p.37) Suffice to say, there are many more life lessons that we learn from Collin but I don\u2019t want to overwhelm you with more quotes. I recommend this novel. It was lovely and profound. A perfect reading for the weekend. . [A Tree of Night and Other Stories]These stories are distinct. I have never read anything like it. Some are strange with supernatural elements and mysterious. They varied location between New York to small Southern towns. They captured definitive moments that marked a tragedy or a change. Many are fatalistic. Characters tended to be lost or when they wished for something it always went for the worst.My favorite short stories were \"Miriam\" and \"My side of the Matter\". This last one was funny. Humor was easily detectable on the narrative. It was a change from the rest of them. \"Miriam\" had a beautiful description. It tackles the theme of loneliness, helplessness and the snowy weather mimicked the character feelings.\"In times of terror or immense distress, there are moments when the mind waits, as though for a revelation, while a skein of calm is woven over thought;\" (p.173)\"The Headless Hawk\" and \"A Tree of Night\" were not my cup of tea. They are mysterious and perfect for Halloween. \"Jug of Silver\" story was full of suspense.The first story \"Master Misery\" reminded me a lot of \"Lady of Hay\" by Barbara Erskine. It\u2019s about dreams and hypnosis. There is a strong metaphor on the idea of selling our dreams. I felt the author had a significant message but couldn\u2019t grasp it. Sylvia felt lonely and yearned to be taken into consideration. By giving away her dreams she became lost, empty. She was better off before. This idea of, be careful what you wish for, is clearly the emphasis on the second story, \"Children on their Birthdays\".\"\u2026just as we were wishing that something would happen, something did;\" (p.119)In \"Shut a Final Door\", the main character is lonely and is in search of something. \"But he did not know where to begin thinking about himself, did not know where to find the center.\" (p.137) He is self-centered and is dependable of people. He is not virtuous nor loyal. This notion of going in circle is portrayed by Walter always observing the fan spinning on several occasions.\"\u2026experience is a circle of which no moment can be isolated, forgotten.\" (p.148)Many Times, I felt a little confused, not fully understanding the story. They were condensed in meaning. Some other times, I wished I knew more. I wished they were as complete as \"The Grass Harp\".

I'd bought it second hand, and there was a piece of paper, credit card sized, blue with an arabic phrase written on it; used as a bookmark. I have no idea whatsoever as to what the arabic means.This isn't a long read and I am surprised to see that I have had it sitting and waiting for almost two years! I really enjoyed this book. I've read a few of Capote's already: quite a few short stories, Breakfast at Tiffanys, Summer Crossing and In Cold Blood. It says on the back of this book \"This one must be the funniest, happiest and most captivating of Truman Capote's novels\". I'm not so sure about the captivating bit, but this is a really upbeat, eccentric story. I really enjoyed it.It's set in a little town in southern small town America and focuses on one household of eccentrics: two ageing sisters, a black woman convinced she is a native American, and their orphaned nephew, 16 years old. One of the sisters is serious and a successful business woman; the other, Dolly, only likes to eat sweet things, is a bit dotty and makes potions in an old bathtub which she sells by mail order as a dropsy cure. After a fight over this business, the sisters fall out, and Dolly, the nephew Colin, and the black woman, Catherine, leave home and move into a treehouse in the woods. Which makes the rest of the town very angry, and they come marching over to sort them out...Really enjoyed this book. And the characters are fantastic. And he has such a way of writing about them and their eccentricities without belittling them or turning them into silly characterteurs.

The ripened urban specifics of Answered Prayers and In Cold Blood, and to a lesser extent Breakfast at Tiffany's, pale somewhat in comparison to Other Voices, Other Rooms, Summer Crossing, many of Truman's early short fiction, and ... The Grass Harp. The Grass Harp, after this first reading, is certainly my favorite story of Truman Capote's. It was full of that charm and magic and hearkened back to the poignant pleasantness of A Christmas Memory.Truman's early life is on full display, as it was in A Christmas Memory and Other Voices, Other Rooms; that of a young boy abandoned by his parents in the South to live with mysterious family members.The Grass Harp is a short book, a brief read like Summer Crossing. The story isn't without its action and drama, but it is largely a sweet story, sugary in its nostalgic description. And Capote's renowned prose is on full display, dashed with color and texture and light.An astounding story."}, {"userName": "Irene Ziegler", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3575048-irene-ziegler", "userReview": "I discovered Truman Capote with In Cold Blood. Then I gobbled up everything else I could find in the library. This is the book that first brought him fame, and introduced me to southern fiction. While he didn't \"invent a genre\" here, as he did with In Cold Blood, his voice was diaphanous and faintly perfumed, like Tennessee Williams in the pre-cocktail morning. In fact, I think Capote and Williams created that iconic atmosphere of humid sadness in a rocking chair, and the young misfit in a faded lace dress and sensible shoes. I don't like thinking about Capote in his later years, when he became a character in his own life, having all of the frailties but none of the vulnerabilities of the people he wrote about. But this book, and to a certain extent, Music for Chameleons as well, show him at his best: sensitive, imaginative and in control of his story, at least for a little while."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/716599-jennifer", "userReview": "Whatever you do, don't see the revolting movie version of this exquisite novella. This is poetry, prose, and perfection between two narrow covers. It is a simple story in the tradition of Carson McCullers, but without the prop of physical deformity or mental aberration. A young orphaned boy goes to live with two eccentric aunts: one childlike and sincere, one embittered and controlling. The elegant plot is driven by a crisis when the ambitious sister attempts to profit from the other, triggering her departure from the house and temporary encampment in the branches of an archetypal and all-embracing oak."}, {"userName": "Sylvester", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2289972-sylvester", "userReview": "Read this because I enjoyed the movie.
