Le Guin is a part of her Hainish cycle of books. This work involves an alien traveler who has arrived in a forest region of what was once the eastern United States with amnesia. His journey across the continent allows Le Guin to describe a dystopian landscape that could compliment the future as described by Walter M. Miller, Jr\u2019s A Canticle for Leibowitz. The book is highlighted by Le Guin\u2019s remarkable imagination and her sparse but descriptive prose. The subject matter lags some and her vision is sometimes difficult to follow but for a fan of Le Guin this is a good read."}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "A strong 4 stars. I really enjoyed this 1967 novel, set on a far-future version of Earth. A man stumbles through the forest, his mind a complete blank slate, his eyes alien, golden cat's eyes. He's taken in and taught by a small group of humans, who teach him their language and give him the name of Falk, but eventually he is encouraged to leave and go find out who he really is.And so a dangerous, cross-country journey begins. Earth is sparsely populated by humans who live very simply, reportedly enforced by a conquering group (the Shing) from another planet. But there are layers upon layers of misunderstanding and deception, and it's not clear to Falk (or the reader) until very late in the novel where the truth lies. The ending was great fun, but I really wanted to know What Happened After. And what exactly was up with the cat's eyes?While this novel works fine as a stand-alone read, it shares a history with Planet of Exile, and my appreciation for it was definitely enhanced by having read that short novel right before this one. I also had fun trying to parse out where exactly Falk was in his travels through what used to be the United States, based on clues like \"Mzurra\" and \"Arksa\" and \"Inland River.\" (Kansas, for whatever reason, has proudly hung onto its name.)More to come."}, {"userName": "J.G. Keely", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84023-j-g-keely", "userReview": "Like the rest of the early books in the Hainish series, this one has a very familiar tone and plot. We have our isolated, alienated protagonist on his quest for one single goal through an unpredictable world which he cannot comprehend, making strangely disconnected romantic liaisons on the way, and constantly lost in thought about how human relationships are supposed to work.But of all the series, this book uses these recurrent themes in the most interesting and naturalistic ways. The first half of the book, where the post-apocalyptic theme is most prominent, is the stronger portion. LeGuin gives us many brief vignettes of our protagonist's journey across the world, each one different in tone, each one modifying the character's overall experience and giving new insight to his fundamental quest of self-discovery.Every encounter seems to reveal some aspect of the madness of humanity, but always remembering that in our mad obsessions and unpredictability lie also our wisdom, our unique experiences--something to be learned. It seems telling that LeGuin's standard character psychology of an emotionally stunted paranoid works best in a story about a complete amnesiac lost in a post-apocalyptic world of deadly dangers, but kudos to her for writing to suit her habits; it's a trick more writers should use.The dystopian aspect comes on rather suddenly and completely changes the tone of the story, almost as if each half were a separate short piece loosely connected, except that the first half does not have a conclusion without the second to cap it. The dystopia of hidden psychics bears a definite resemblance to Slan, though LeGuin's is a more subtle and practised hand.This latter arc is fairly exciting and interesting, but has less of the unique vision. Its tone of oppressive confusion is also somewhat repetitive, and might have benefited from the character actively switching between options rather than sitting inactively avoiding either one. The character does eventually come to a conclusion, but it would have helped the depth of the conflict if the character had more actively explored the sides rather than sitting and ruminating.Then again, a lot of LeGuin's conflicts play out internally as struggles within the characters' minds. This is not a bad method, but I think such conflicts play out better when such conflicts are clearly demonstrated by the character's actions and patterns of speech and behavior, bolstered here and there by a thought, rather than descending entirely into the character and leaving the plot behind for the period of digression.But despite these caveats, I found this the most varied and imaginative of LeGuin's books, with a truly engrossing combination of verisimilitude and hallucinatory imagery from the cusp of madness. I look forward to more LeGuin in the future, especially if this work is an indication of her evolution as a writer, who here seems almost to have found her ideal voice, if sometimes fleetingly."}, {"userName": "Zanna", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna", "userReview": "[Their city, Es Toch, is lifeless; its description reminded me of London's giant shopping malls, which very quickly sap all my morale and give me a sick headache with their soullessness. It is a shopping mall designed by Gaudi perhaps: gaudy, sumptuous, unwholesome in its sterile decadence.Zove was right that Falk was an intelligent man before his mind was 'razed'. The section where he regains his memory as Ramarren could be excruciating, since the character we have been relating too has been forcibly excised, but Ramarren is a powerful mind able to respond to the crisis. However, the true brilliance of the ending is that Zove and Parth become heroes as the personality they have cultivated, Falk, is indispensable to Ramarren. Le Guin affirms both personalities: the mature and disciplined, highly trained and educated adult of the rigid, hierarchical, scientific society, and the impulsive, childish mind nurtured by cultured, sophisticated, cautious exiles hiding their anarchic enclaves in the forest, lost to time.

Three quarters of the book tells of this man\u2019s journey to Es Toch, and as such is a sort of average questing tale with friends and foes along the way. It is up to our hero to figure out which is which. The ultimate answer he seeks is quite the interesting revelation, as is also what happens after he figures this out.

But I do not know what I would have made of City of Illusions had I not read Planet of Exile first. When this novel came out, there had been three Hainish novels published in two years, and so readers did not have the eight novels we have now to choose from. It's more likely that readers came to this work with the first two under their readers' belts. Writing about City of Illusions opens up the field of possible spoilers, but they are spoilers in reverse related to a previous novel. Does any of that make sense? Well, after all, the book is titled City of Illusions.Le Guin brings us back to Terra for this story. The hero staggers naked and filthy out of a forest, his mind a blank and his eyes amber as a cat's. He stumbles into the clearing of the House of Zove, and we cannot appreciate his luck until we encounter with him much less savory remnants of humanity later in the story. These clannish people care for him, educate him, and incorporate him into their social world. They name him Falk, a reference to his amber eyes. But questions remain. Is he human or alien? The eyes are problem and his five-year relationship with one of Zove's daughters remains childless. This sterility with a human argues for his own alien origin. Zove dismisses him from the house, sending him west to the Es Toch, the fabled city of the Shing, the Enemy who now hold dominion over Earth. The novel is Falk's journey west, across a North America we recognize by geographical landmarks and traces of a civilization wiped out a millennium before. The people he meets may be kind or cruel, savage or delusional. His quandary is his knowledge that while knowing he can trust no one he knows he must constantly trust some one to go further on his quest. When he reaches Es Toch, the matter is further complicated by his encounter with the Shing. Are they the humans they claim to be or the intergalactic raiders he suspects them of being. As in all Le Guin's novels, telepathy, or mind speaking, plays a role. It is an honored, direct means of speaking truthfully and intimately with another. Falk suspects that the Shing have mastered mind lying.This is a novel about power and what people, or aliens, are willing to do to acquire it and hang desperately onto it, whether they control a clearing in the forest or an entire planet."}, {"userName": "David (\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3) ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5431286-david", "userReview": "A decent book.

Le Guin\u2019s HAINISH CYCLE continues with City of Illusions, which I liked better than its predecessors, Rocannon\u2019s World and Planet of Exile. City of Illusions takes place on Earth sometimes in the far future after an alien invasion has killed off most of the people and has completely changed the Earth\u2019s ecology, infrastructure, and geopolitical arrangement. There\u2019s a large capital city run by an alien race called the Shing, but most of the humans are spread out and divided into small clusters in the hinterlands which have gone back to their natural state after Earth\u2019s cities were destroyed. While there are futuristic technologies in the capital, the rest of the people live off the land without technological help and with only occasional glimpses of the advanced society that their ancestors knew before it decayed.To prevent takeovers, the Shing do not allow the people to organize or even to communicate over long distances. If anyone attempts anything that threatens the government, they are arrested and, since the Shing do not allow the taking of human lives, they are \u201crazed,\u201d meaning their memories are wiped out. To keep humans subjugated, the Shing also use their powers to cast illusions and to lie with their minds, which is why their capitol city is called the City of Illusions.Our story begins as a man with cat-like eyes wakes up in the wilderness and doesn\u2019t know who or where he is. In fact, he doesn\u2019t know anything \u2014 his mind is blank. His only potential clue is a gold ring he wears which tells him that he once belonged somewhere. When a wilderness family takes him in, they name him Falk and teach him how to be a man again (if he ever was a man \u2014 his eyes suggest at least some non-human genes). After several years, Falk decides to set out for the City of Illusions to find out who he is. Along the way he meets other types of people, experiences different cultures, and has some scary adventures. By the time he gets to the city, he has made a new life for himself, has made friends, has fallen in love, and has learned a lot about the world he lives in, but not any clues about himself.When Falk meets the Shing in the City of Illusions, he discovers who he is, but he learns that he must choose between his old mostly unknown life and the new life he has been living for several years. He also learns that the aliens have a different story about what happened to Earth than the stories he has previously heard. It\u2019s not easy to separate truth from lies or to know who can be trusted. Falk has some major dilemmas to resolve and some major choices to make.The setting of City of Illusions \u2014 America\u2019s ruined cities being gradually overtaken by forests \u2014 is appealing (reminds me of Gene Wolfe\u2019s NEW SUN books) and so is Falk (especially when we find out who he is) who is developed better than the protagonists in the previous HAINISH CYCLE novels. It helps that Falk doesn\u2019t need a backstory, so we\u2019re not really expecting much there. Unfortunately, none of the other characters are particularly engaging and the villains seem inconsistent (e.g., their insistence that life is sacred doesn\u2019t fit with their other beliefs and actions), but I enjoyed Falk\u2019s travels and dilemmas nonetheless and I liked the ambiguous ending and how this story fills in some information we were left wondering about at the end of Planet of Exile. City of Illusions is short and fast-paced with Le Guin\u2019s usual economy of words which I\u2019ve always admired and which becomes more appreciated the more epic fantasy I read.I listened to Blackstone Audio\u2019s excellent production narrated by Stefan Rudnicki.

It took a long time in the narrative to get to the core premise, but when it was revealed, it made me put the book down for a minute to really contemplate Le Guin's theme.In one of Joan Didion's essays she opines, \"We are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be - whether or not we find them attractive company.\" As we age, and our memory of our former selves goes through a constant revision, it can become difficult to relate to that other manifestation of ourselves. So if we have all the memory of our old self removed, and we are told by a third person about the individual that we used to be (and that \"person\" sounds like someone we wouldn't necessarily like) - how do we know who we really are, anyway? Is this starting to sound like The Fixx's song \"Are We Ourselves?\" I'm feeling that, too.

Like the others, it's about a journey of sorts, and starts off slow and gradually builds in intensity. But to me it was also the most mature work of the three, dealing with themes of illusion, dissolution, and dystopia. We begin with a madman, or child-man, in the woods who has no memory of his past, and who is taken in and cared for by a forest family. After he recuperates, the patriarch of the family has an inkling that this yellow-eyed stranger has a Destiny to fulfill, and indeed he does. Setting off across what is probably a dissolved and broken USA, he seeks the city of Es Toch, the capitol of humans' enemy, the Shing.In other reviews I've seen some discussion that Le Guin's characters are not relatable or likeable, and that they bear some resemblance to LotR. Indeed Tolkein wrote in much a similar style of emotional distance, and like countless other stories, the Hero's Journey is reenacted here (see Joseph Campbell for a fuller discussion). But I also think that the fact that you have to scratch under the surface for the characters' emotions makes it more interesting, not less. And for me, the formalism lends the story an epic quality, almost more high-fantasy than sci-fi.Le Guin's best work? Likely not. There's a reason The Left Hand of Darkness is the classic. But definitely worth a read. Like the other Hainish cycle novels, this one can be read as a stand-alone for those not wishing to toil through Rocannon's World or Planet of Exile, which are certainly less polished."}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/844382-josh", "userReview": "Ursula Le Guin sure is interested in putting people from an advanced civilizations into primitive ones and seeing how they deal with a radically new set of customs. But she's such a fantastic writer, and is exceptionally good at using these situations to examine multiple cultures at once. City of Illusions changes things up a bit from the first two books in there is also something of a mystery element: our protagonist actually may or may not be from an advanced civilization. We don't know, and neither does he, because his memory's been wiped. He's resultingly more sympathetic than his counterparts in the earlier novels, and I came away definitively sadder for him. He has very little control over all the forces affecting him (and wow does he have to go through a lot of crap) and he just wants to be home, only he's not sure where that is. Wraps up the third of three books in a \"Three Hainish Novels\" omnibus. Not a trilogy really, though set in the same universe (with later books making tangential references to the earlier), and similar in tone and themes. Really enjoyed the three as a whole, and each in turn. Very worthwhile to have filled out my Le Guin reading."}, {"userName": "Panagiotis", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11994371-panagiotis", "userReview": "The book ''City of Illusions'' was a really nice surprise for me.Small in size,very easy to read and with a very interesting main character,the book has a really good pace and a lot of suspense.The fact that the Shing race' domination on Earth was based not in weapons but in their extremelly unique ability to play mind games and lie,made the main hero's task extremely difficult.However once more Le Guin's ability to make her heroes outreach their problems and triupmh,not through violence but mostly through self awareness and completion,appears in this book once again.Once more, Le Guin shows us that faith,awareness,wisdom,sincerity and believing in your self are virtues that help you find your way in the dark."}, {"userName": "Pyza W\u0119drowniczka", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50868920-pyza-w-drowniczka", "userReview": "Po dw\u00f3ch pierwszych powie\u015bciach z cyklu Hain czytelnik my\u015bli sobie, \u017ce wie, czego mo\u017ce si\u0119 spodziewa\u0107.

However, he has been through a lot in the journey and it just doesn't make sense that he should be so naive. The last part of the book, after he had been captured, was completely disjointed from the rest. The tone and subject matter changed, and it really had no connection to the beginning of the book at all. Falk all of a sudden became responsible for saving two planets, Earth and his own, and had to figure out how to do so while saving his own life. He could have saved the planets by committing suicide, but that did not occur to him although another character pointed it out to him afterwards, when it was too late. I found that really strange, as it would have made a fitting end to the story if Falk had sacrificed himself.

That section--the slow journey through various dystopic human settlements--is this book's weakness: none of the settlements are especially convincing, and as satisfying as Le Guin's travelogues are (and they are; her descriptions of natural landscapes and the solitude of travel are precise and immersive) the plot here stagnates. But the end comes together beautifully. It's an introspective book--the most significant developments occur within the protagonist's mind, as he considers his situation, life experience, identity--but the results are profound, clever, and tie nicely into the series's shared universe. It rewards active engagement and it's a satisfying testimony to Le Guin's strengths; a lesser author couldn't make that interior narrative so compelling, but Le Guin excels at the personal ramifications of speculative concepts.
