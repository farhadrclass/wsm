His rise as a leader of his group is because he has knowledge of zombies that no one else has. Now, how he got this knowledge is a story in itself!Joseph DiBartolo takes us back to the world of heroes, victims and zombies, lots of zombies, as Peter Troy and his group continue their quest to survive. The truth of the creation of the zombies has been revealed and now the group has decided they will poke holes in the massive balloon of evil that is flying over the world. The Exilir supplies must be destroyed, one plant at a time. To their horror, the chaos has spread, people are being turned and the road to safety is littered with death, destruction and zombies. Wars are not fought without losses or new-found allies, and Peter\u2019s group will know both the pain of loss and the strength of their newest ally.The Rise of Peter Troy, Volume 3: Mayhem is one more non-stop tale from Joseph DiBartolo that slammed me right back into the story after about three words. A short, yet powerful read, heroes will die, revelations can be deadly and only together, can these people survive. Mr. DiBartolo has once again added to his mini-series with life-like descriptions, the best side of humanity\u2019s \u201caverage person,\u201d and the worst side of greed and power. Grab a bat, an axe or whatever you can find; there may be more zombies behind the next corner. Great writing! Non-stop intrigue and zombies, sounds like perfect fantasy reading!I received this copy from Joseph DiBartolo in exchange for my honest review.Series: The Rise of Peter Troy - Book 3Publication Date: September 17, 2015Publisher: Joseph DiBartoloGenre: Horror | Short StoriesPrint Length: 38 pagesAvailable from: AmazonFor Reviews & More: http://tometender.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Netanella", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1157679-netanella", "userReview": "\"Mayhem\" is packed full of action and carnage, almost at breakneck speed, in this third installment of the short-story serial, \"The Rise of Peter Troy.\" Peter is a nerd-turned-apocalyptic hero, and in this episode he has an opportunity to channel his Chuck Norris skills while wielding his handy-dandy butcher's cleaver from his previous life selling pastrami. The mystery of the zombie outbreak deepens, with cases of the Elixir energy drink mysteriously showing up in the so-called safety zones. Overall, not a bad installment. I am getting a little annoyed, however, at the constant use of the term \"the decayed ones\" instead of the more obvious term \"zombie\", as it makes for some very awkward sentence structures.Kudos to the author, Mr. DiBartolo! Overall, nicely done!"}, {"userName": "A.

Again, we start where the last one ended and we find ourselves riding with the crew through the rubble of the plane crash. A scene that could have been amazing, had there been lots of details.  Like right after they drive through the brief incident of decayed exiting the plane ablaze, they find two people being chased. They run the monsters over (which by now the F-350's engine should be about dead since it's never been cleaned) to find a guy and an Asian girl. I say this because the girl is described but not the guy, other than him being dark-skinned. That could be Hispanic, Arabic or even African-American. The the girl isn't described quite the same a few pages over. First, she's \"strikingly beautiful\", then out of nowhere, she's got a unique look because her facial features were flawless but she carried extra piercings and tattoos that screamed badass chick. I'm lost cause strikingly beautiful doesn't usually equate to piercings and tats, though beauty is in the eye and yadda yadda yadda. Did it hurt the tale? No, but Details, man! I'd rather have overkill than not enough. The stories are a fun ride, but it seems the story jumped way too fast on their missions I'll see what happens in the next installment for 2016. Until then, I enjoyed the story. Below is the rating for this book and then there's one rating for all three. On to the next book!

This awesomely, fast paced read had me turning each page with a new, eager excitement. While I don't do spoilers, I will instead honestly ask...when is this going to be made into a movie? As an extreme zombie fan, I would be the first in line to watch it. The book is bad ass enough...a movie would be EPIC! 10 stars for Joseph DiBartolo's Vol. 3.

As each book is really just the same continuing story I'm only going to write 1 review for the first 4 books. Peter Troy, the main protagonist, is sitting at home wondering where his life went wrong having recently lost both his job and his girlfriend. He is also an avid zombie fan. Who knew that on this particular morning when he woke up that all of the information he'd learned from said movies would come into play. After getting over the shock of seeing what's going on outside his door he pulls up his big boy pants and grabs his meat cleaver and decides this is what he was made for \u2013 fighting the zombie apocalypse. Along the way he teams up with some more survivors and together they set out to figure out what caused the apocalypse and to then in turn to try and prevent anymore people from getting infected. I have to say I laughed pretty hard when it was revealed what was causing people to turn. Its defiantly not something that's been used before but yet \u201cthe reason\u201d is something I have always thought was evil.. What is it? \u2013 HA you need to read to find out... There are currently only 4 parts out so far with more to come. Looking forward to the showdown..Plenty of gore through out each episode but it goes along with the story so I wouldn't expect anything less. Even though things move pretty quick your instantly enamored with the rag tag crew making there way through hordes of infected from the south to the east coast. (on a side note \u2026 I have to say I found this author/series through M.A. Hollstein (Michelle Ann Hollstein) whose own apocalypse book Fatal Reaction: The Beginning I had recently read and loved."}, {"userName": "Randy Harmelink", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2029520-randy-harmelink", "userReview": "I've read the first three books so far, and giving them all a 4-star rating. It's not necessarily a great story, and most of it will be forgettable, but I found it easy to read and enjoyed reading it. I did like he cause of the outbreak.However, one plea to the author -- stop calling a group of zombies a hoard. They are a horde of zombies."}, {"userName": "Ashley Ehlers", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11802552-ashley-ehlers", "userReview": "Originally posted on Paranormal Sisters: http://paranormalsisters.blogspot.com...I don't really have much to say, I read this the same day I finished the previous book. The story continued where the second one ended and I kind of liked how they had a mission on stopping the cause of the infection, but honestly isn't it already too late to stop it when planes are falling out of the sky? I honestly don't understand how the characters feel like family when they've only been together for maybe like two days, when that thought crossed the main guys mind I thought it was a bit too dramatic. But then again it's probably cause I wasn't really connected to them or to the story myself. I also don't understand the need of this new female character, which felt like it might be building up for a love triangle? At least from the action they displayed it felt like that, though I could be wrong but I have no need to buy the next one to find out.Overall another meh read and I have no urge to continue the series. I'm sad I didn't love it as much as everyone else. I feel like they need to be longer and more developed. Maybe if I connected to the main guy better I might have liked it but I doubt it because I also wasn't a big fan of the dialog. It felt cheesy, too cocky, and not really \"adult\" even though the guy is an adult. Maybe it's cause I'm a girl, who knows, I just wasn't feeling him."}, {"userName": "Lindy Lu Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11001505-lindy-lu-reviews", "userReview": "The journey continues for Peter and his crew, after discovering the reason behind the outbreak they are on a mission. To destroy the cause and everyone involved can go down with it. Unfortunately that mission isn\u2019t easy peasy as one might think, they have to battle the undead and alive around every corner. Still meeting new people along the way to join their cause, why not they have nothing better to do. Another fast paced quicky from Mr. DiBartolo, I love his take on these flesh eaters. I did feel I could relate with the characters and they are very likeable. Peter is a good leader even when he\u2019s doubtful he can be a savior to his friends he still does all he can. Everyone needs to be like Peter, with all my knowledge I\u2019m going to be a zombie apocalypse survivor ;) There is some language but when the world is going down the toilet who cares right?
