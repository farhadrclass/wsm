Stone draws his characters beautifully, but is unsparing in documenting their shortcomings. Like Moby Dick, it's a story about a man and a boat, but it's also about a quest. The main character, Owen Browne, has been leading an okay life as a salesman for a yacht company, but is also feeling less connected over time with the various aspects of his life. Suddenly he has a chance to change all of this when the millionaire owner of the company disappears just a few months before he is scheduled to participate in a race around the world. Browne offers to take over, but it becomes soon clear that he's in way over his head.In a second plot line, a respected but cynical movie director, Ron Strickland, has signed a deal to film the race. Strickland is intrigued by Browne's willingness to take over the race and begins to insinuate himself into the lives of Browne, his wife Anne and their fifteen year old daughter in keeping with his cinema verite style. In the first half of the book, the we meet the other men who will be in the race and Browne does his best to prepare for the solo voyage around the world. Browne knows this kind of solo boating is way beyond his experience, but he hopes that he will learn enough before and during the race so that somehow it will all work out. In the second half of the book, the race is on and Browne gets off to a good start in spite of his limited experience. Strickland has entrusted Browne with cameras in order to get additional footage that can be used for the planned documentary. Browne also writes copious notes in the ship's journal. Maybe, just maybe, this trip will truly be a triumph for him at all levels. Back on the mainland, Strickland, Anne and several other observers monitor the race based on radio transmissions, faxes and other communications. The book takes several strange turns as Browne gets deeper into pursuing his dream and also learns hard truths about himself and the technical limitations of his ship and his nautical skills. The worlds of reality, myth and magical thinking entwine as the voyage continues from sea to sea and Browne is pushed to his limits and beyond. In the meantime, Stickland pursues his agenda and is hoping that this documentary will truly be the breakout piece of work that vaults him to the next level with little thought for any collateral damage this might cause within the Browne family. This kind of book requires patience from the reader, but the rewards are rich as Stone spins a powerful story and creates a series of memorable characters who collide and interact in surprising ways."}, {"userName": "Eli Bishop", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/278873-eli-bishop", "userReview": "This is one of my favorite novels of any kind. It brings together everything I like about Robert Stone: characters with great potential and terrible flaws, a variety of approaches to love, a strong feeling for place and for different kinds of work, physical danger described in unusual poetic terms while still being frightening, very dark humor and gorgeous prose. It feels grounded and whole in a way that his books don't always achieve, even though he's deliberately writing against his grain, giving two-thirds of the stage not to the wandering bohemian journalist character but to mainstream suburban New York Republicans. And despite being about people who don't know what they're doing, it's plotted like a graceful machine-- every step of the setup seems like a simple detail at the time, and then once the story gets going, those details align into something that feels inevitable.The central event, a solo sailing race around the world, is sort of based on a real incident which would have made a good story by itself, but Stone uses very little of that story except for one particular infamously bad decision. The rest of it is perfectly constructed to examine how someone could make that decision, to imagine how the seeds of it might have been planted by interactions with other people without their awareness, and to relate it to the choices we make in less dramatic circumstances. Even though the characters are sometimes lost in introspection, the setting and the action are always very specific: this is how this or that person handles a boat, attends a convention, films an interview. The guy in the boat isn't just an abstract man facing nature and facing himself; his situation is influenced by his family and community and job, and even when he's alone it's a modern kind of solitude where you can make phone calls-- and that thread of contact affects the course of the story in a way that wouldn't have been possible in an earlier time and, for different reasons, wouldn't be possible now.If you've ever read anything by this author, it's not really giving anything away to say that by the end of this book some extremely sad things have happened. The last page always kills me and makes me weepy; it's an ambiguous and in some ways hopeful ending, but it's not the kind of hope you would have hoped for. It's all worth it, though."}, {"userName": "JFKW", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/359996-jfkw", "userReview": "When a 400 page book is a page turner, it must be pretty good. I can't even bring myself to write any kind of review. Two minutes ago I read about a woman closing the door to her house. That's the ending, sucker. To read this book and cozy up to the characters is to put your consciousness inside of a gray whale calf cut away from its mother, pummeled and thrashed by killer whales for hours until it dies and is eaten."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3206345-leah", "userReview": "Although I can agree with other reviewers that the book is in some ways Hemingwayan, Stone's language lacked a comparably inviting luster. In addition to the dull prose, the story was predictable and the characters undeveloped and trite. The words that a friend of mine wrote in a journal required by her teacher while she was reading OLD MAN AND THE SEA sum up my feelings of the various scenes in the book perfectly, \"Same shit.

His characters are complex and fallible. Like Phillip K. Dick, he weaves a lot of different points of view that change how you see each one. They have fantastic qualities and weak and despicable ones. Here, a documentary filmmaker with the ability of a cold perception stands as a commentary of storytelling itself. But there is more than that in this tale about a man against the sea. Like _Children of Light_ and _Dog Soldiers_, Stone has these unreal climaxes that seem almost akin to magical realism; however, it is psychosis, schizophrenia, and exhaustion that really brings them on, but they are beautiful and strange just the same: \"Finally, broken-willed, he consented to turn, dreading the thing that might confront him in the window. There, in place of the declining sun, he saw innumerable misshapen discs stretched in limitless perspective to an expanded horizon. It was a parody of the honest mariner's sighting. Each warped ball was the reflection of another in an index glass, each one hung suspended, half submerged in a frozen sea. They extended forever, to infinity, in a universe of infinite singularities. In the ocean they suggested, there could be no measure and no reason. There could be neither direction nor horizon. It was an ocean without a morning, without sanity or light\" (362)."}, {"userName": "Ann M", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/150354-ann-m", "userReview": "Starts so slowly and dully that I doubt it would ever be published these days without an already well known author. The entire first half is background for the second half. The story of an improbable sailing trip, an improbable love affair and an improbable suicide. It is serviceably written, as far as grammar, etc., but there is no foreshadowing, nothing convincing, and the attempts to include philosophy entirely flat and dull. A sheltered but gorgeous republican baby boomer wife falls for a sleazy stuttering filmmaker (having met his prostitute girlfriend) while her husband, an equally gorgeous republican yacht salesman, attempts to circumnavigate the globe in his company's poorly made product. At the end, it's tied in a bow. Remind me never to read anything else by this old white male author, pictured on the back on his yacht."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2273664-michael", "userReview": "good writer, but in the words of Homer J. \"BORING!\""}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1068533-robert", "userReview": "Top 3 favorite novels of all time. Longtime Stone devotee. Got a few chapters in on a softcover used edition and decided I needed a hardcover first. Found a leatherbound, signed first edition online for only $7 or something. Have all his short stories, read Dogs of War--I'm going after the entire ouevre.But it's the story, the writing that carries this thing. The Triangulation here is exquisite; there's humor, pathos, poetry and pure truth about big picture stuff that I've never come across in a novel before and I've read many fine ones. This is widely recognized as a classic of the form, a true masterpiece. No way could I overstate how good this book is. It's about integrity, sailing, Vietnam, corporate America, human frailty--and so much more. All the hallmarks of a good Stone story: character (in this case, a woman--not uncommon in his writing) with a substance abuse problem; sex; competition; interior monologues for each of the principal characters brimming with granite-hard wisdom. Nobody writes like Stone. His attention to detail, his ability to subtly educate and indoctrinate the reader into just about any enterprise is unsurpassed. Stone, you magnificent bastard--I read your book."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1944240-robert", "userReview": "Outerbridge Reach, a.k.a. Rich White People Problems. Somehow, Robert Stone has made a round-the-world, solo boat race utterly boring and pretentious.

The people involved are imagined vividly, the plot is taut and unpredictable and the focus of the book is credible and sharp, even as it raises fundamental human questions and dilemmas. It is an excellent novel, that I rate very highly.Owen Browne is the long-distance sailor in the story, an ex-Navy man who served in Vietnam, now works in PR for a yachting firm, and is somehow hoping to recapture his authenticity as a man by taking on this single-handed challenge; his is an uncomfortable life from which he feels somewhat detached and seeks to remedy. His wife, Anne, has her own form of escape, an over-reliance on alcohol -- and she too finds there are fundamentals that she feels are missing. Then there is a cynical film-maker, Ron Strickland, who has kept his world together by disparaging others, but now finds himself more and more caught up in this ocean saga.The book does not go as expected, as the voyage does not, and a finely textured complex novel is the result."}, {"userName": "Joe Johnston", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1040272-joe-johnston", "userReview": "One of the best novels I've ever read.

The book jacket called it a \"Classic American Story\" but I disagree -- I thought it subverted the more obvious summon-the-strength, conquering man tropes. The book is expertly written, like everything else I've read by RS, but it was a little unsatisfying. I was little disappointed in Anne, the wife.
