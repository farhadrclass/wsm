They are the one stainless and unimpeachable achievement of the human race. It saddens me to think that I shall have to die with thousands of books unread that would have given me noble and unblemished happiness.Scott Esposito made a shocking confession a few years ago on Coversational Reading: he didn't go to used book stores. He bought used books exclusively online. I was and remain shocked. Julian Barnes noted once with typical eloquence in The Guardian that the internet has certainly solved the dilemma of The Collector, but what it has obscured is the clumsy accidents in the stacks which change our lives.I picked this up at a sale a few years back. My attentions were drawn to such because of a GR list about numerous texts cited within, including Burton's Anatomy. Well, not only is Anatomy of Melancholy referenced, it is inspires the protagonist and the novel three-quarters of the way through. This can be read a well crafted potboiler about 1919 Brooklyn. it is also an alert about what is slipping from view. The Haunted Bookshop was selected as a diversion on day ravaged by sinus issues. It s call is greater than that. It is an affirmation of our nerdy treks."}, {"userName": "Dorcas", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21426381-dorcas", "userReview": "2.5 StarsI found this somewhat disappointing after Parnassus on Wheels. in Parnassus, we had a sweet, comfort read, perfect for book lovers. In Haunted Bookshop, we still have a bookish setting which is nice, \u00a0but the story itself (in my opinion) is a cheesy, rather boring mystery featuring German troublemakers, a missing book, and a tepid romance.Nope, not a winner for me.By the way, this is not a ghost story. The only \"ghosts\" are fictional characters living in unread books.\u00a0Oh, and one thing that bugged me as a book lover, the incessant SMOKING done in the bookshop. Nooooo, don't do it! Think of the yellow tar, the smell forever impregnated in the (now) sticky pages. No, no no. NOT in a bookstore. Such desecration, oh I can hardly take this sitting down.Ps...Some of my GR friends enjoyed this a lot more than I did, so don't let me put you off, you might enjoy it more."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "Jolly good fun!  A delightful story (love letter of sorts in a figurative way) celebrating bookshops, booksellers, bibliophiles, wordsmiths, and the joyous phenomenon of being 'haunted' by books.  \"Did you ever notice how books track you down and hunt you out? They follow you like the hound in Francis Thompson's poem. They know their quarry! . . . It's one of the uncanniest things I know to watch a real book on its career - it follows you and follows you and drives you into a corner and  makes  you read it.\" Woven into this classic is a dallying real world romance between Roger's apprentice bookshop clerk and a newly acquired advertising acquaintance, in addition to an 'explosive' bit of book sleuthing surrounding the disappearing, reappearing, Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches, with Elucidations by Thomas Carlyle: Volume 1.  \"Living in a bookshop is like living in a warehouse of explosives. Those shelves are ranked with the most furious combustibles in the world - the minds of men.\" Morely's writing is such that one can't help be amused, enlightened, and drawn in by wit, wisdom, and wonderment. There's something here for every bibliophile - whatever your genre preference. Especially delightful: the laugh aloud moments of snark and snick humor poking fun at advertising, publishing, literary deficiencies, marriage, and book haunting's.  \"Some people have let their reading faculties decay so that all I can do is hold a  post mortem  on them. But most are still open to treatment. There is no one so grateful as the man to whom you have given just the book his soul needed and he never knew it.\" Fun illustrations too. And so many,marvelous quotable quotes:  \"The real book-lovers, you know, are generally among the humbler classes. A man who is impassioned with books has little time or patience to grow rich by concocting schemes for cozening his fellows.\"\"One thing . . . you must grant the bookseller. He is tolerant. He is patient of all ideas and theories. Surrounded, engulfed by the torrent of men's words, he is willing to listen to them all. \"\"It is only the very young who find satisfaction in lying abed in the morning. Those who approach the term of the fifth decade are sensitively aware of the fluency of life, and have no taste to squander it among the blankets.\" Oh, yes, so many marvelous quotes!! AND a plethora of literary masters and their works are celebrated within these antiquated pages - pages steeped in the luscious essence of aging bookbinding aromas -that I've jotted down to haunt, before they haunt me. All the way around (sans a rambling letter mid book that seemed stuck in like a footnote??? ) I thought this a most worthy and enjoyable reading experience.

I think it was mainly that I enjoyed Helen as a POV character better than Aubrey, who I didn't much care for. I mean, I get that his callow-youth-ness was deliberate, but I didn't care much about him nor was I rooting for him to get the girl. You can do better, Titania! The German spy plot was pretty silly, although it probably held up better in the WWI era.

Reading the same book, of course.An early work (1919) from the likeable Morley is excessively cute.

Roger Mifflin reprises his role begun in Parnassus on Wheels but is now stationary with his now-wife Helen in a bookstore in Brooklyn, not rolling along the roads of the country as an itinerant bookseller. The story allows for frequent philosophical musing on the place of books in the then modern world, the place of the seller as an educator of the masses. If this sounds heavy, it most definitely is not. The novel is light and fun with a smile on most every page. Some of the thoughts about the publishing industry seem surprisingly modern. It seems some things never change. There is a mystery and a romance to top off the tale.Highly recommended as a period piece but I recommend reading \"Parnassus on Wheels\" first."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Well-loved books from my pastRating: 3.5* of fiveAllegedly a spy story-cum-mystery, it's really a love note from author Morley to the trade of bookselling, with a side of supremely sweet love story.And I can't help myself, I am charmed and beguiled by the book, by the memories it holds, and by the sheer anti-German fervor of it.This book and Parnassus on Wheels were in my maternal grandmother's library. She died in 1977, and I chose these two books to be mine because I liked the titles. I read them over that summer, while I was staying in California with my father and stepmother. It was a trying period. The escape into a whimsical, crabby, loving relationship between the couple before and after their marriage was welcome, and the stuff about books...the mystical *fit* between reader and writer, abetted by the bookseller...has stayed with me all these years.My father was a very proud Nordic Aryan. He thought of himself as an Ubermensch of the first water, and was constantly extolling German thises and thatses and buying Blaupunkt radios and Telefunken TVs and BMWs and Porsches. I used the period-perfect anti-German caricatures in this book to get up his nose in a way he couldn't complain about without getting his titty in the wringer of freedom of speech and encouraging reading etc etc. Hours of fun for me, I can only imagine how ready to murder me he must have been. Heh.So it's unlikely I'll reread the books now, but what joy they afforded me then! Given the sheer meanness of my appreciation for them, I think it wisest to leave these two entertainments in the groves of memory as lovely flowers beside the path leading to adulthood."}, {"userName": "Maria Clara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46308842-maria-clara", "userReview": "UNA DELICIA.

times with Roger Mifflin expounding on books and their importance coupled with many elements of the book trade, the information was so interesting that I don't believe the volume deserves anything

Aubrey Gilbert works for an advertising agency and falls in love with Roger's \"apprentice\", the beautiful daughter of the advertising agency's biggest client.

It also contains much to interest the dabbler in social history, with the descriptions of lodging houses, cheap restaurants, and other details of life in New York a hundred years ago. Unfortunately, the author couldn't resist letting Roger babble on about books, bookselling, and reading, at quite appalling and utterly irrelevant length, leaving the story hanging at often inopportune moments.

I had to wait a day before writing this review so I wouldn't gush too embarrassingly. The book contains a trite, amusing little mystery, interesting in it's parallels to current history and acts of terrorism. Yes, the pen is mightier than the sword, and I wonder if the secret service keeps an eye on copies of Team of Rivals and Lush Life, Obama's recent reading picks. But the book is magnificent when Morley lets Mr. Mifflin rant. At times I felt I was reading current blogs on bookseller sites: \"She asked for The Passing of the Stone, and it turns out she wanted Shelters of Stone; it was blue; it was on this table last year; it has a vampire...\" Do booksellers supply the demand, or create the demand? I've always believed that booksellers do not deal in \"merchandise\", though my beliefs are strongly challenged after repeated inquiries for Twilight, Charlaine Harris, and Lost Symbol, just as Mifflin is discouraged by \"that book about the boy raised by Monks.\" You mean Tarzan?! I like his idea that the uncommon customer acts as our \"unconscious agent of book-destiny,\" leading us to an author we haven't yet met. I'd like to call myself an agent of book-destiny, shedding light on the books that hold up despite a lack of advertising. Sounds rather angelic, no? This is the first time I've ever been tempted to read a book a second time right away. But the pull of book-destiny will assert itself too strongly, and I know I'll be led, instead, to read a handful more Morley titles as I can find them (why are they going out of print?!) with, perhaps, a few more readings of the first through third chapters, for some phrases to keep in my head as the next person asks me for \"that history of Masonism\" or \"Dear God, it's Vodka.\""}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda", "userReview": "Mr Roger Mifflin and his wife Helen ran The Haunted Bookshop together \u2013 living upstairs above their shop was a delight and a pleasure for them both.

Here rather than a traveling bookshop, the setting is a bricks and mortar shop in Brooklyn. I was definitely disappointed with this second book, starring the same characters. Where the first book made no mention of WWI, this book beat me over the head with it. It was written in 1919. Lots of lecturing by Roger Mifflin, the protag of Parnassus. The tone is very anti-German. Where I found Mifflin to be lovable and passionate and maybe a tad eccentric in Parnassus, here I found him to be a long-winded bore. I felt like I was trapped in a room with a boring history professor. There was no way for me to escape. I have found I can't generally skim because I'm sure I'll miss something critical (unless it's gory, then I skip away), so I slogged through many speeches on war. I kept chanting as I read along: two stars, two stars, two stars. The author had a section about the masks we wear around others, always hiding our true selves. I felt like he was trying too hard and should've stuck to the lighter tone of Parnassus. Then,  the focus moved from Mifflin to our hero, Aubrey Gilbert. Aubrey has romantic feelings for Titania, the beautiful young woman working in Mifflin's shop. Aubrey is sure there's something underhanded and possibly dangerous going on in the bookstore , so he decides to investigate before anyone (Titania) gets hurt. Aubrey works at an advertising agency, and he can't seem to turn off that part if his brain. In every situation, he thought of a way to sell a product. I quite enjoyed those bits. That part of the story was fun and earned it another star. Back to what I didn't like.I hated the treatment of the dog Bock in both books. In Parnassus, Mifflin sells his bookmobile to Helen McGill, including his horse and dog. Okay, I'm not a horse person, so I could kind of see that he considered the horse a working animal needed to pull the caravan but to just give away a dog you've had for ten years! Ten years! And he gives him away to a stranger!Maybe I'm taking this too personally. A few years ago, I saw a picture of a grizzled old chocolate lab in the local paper. He was ten years old and free for adoption. I took one look at those sad brown eyes and knew I had to have him. My husband was less sure. We had another lab and two cats already. When I called to get the story on Bodhi, I was told the owners were a young couple who were moving to Florida. They took Bodhi's 11-year-old mother with them and brought Bodhi to the pound. Separated him from his mother! Once my husband heard that, it was a done deal. Bodhi was the best dog ever! We only had him for three short years, but it was the best decision ever. My sweet Bodhi boy. So anyway, back to the book. It bothered me that he just gave Bock away in Parnassus. Regarding the second book, let's just say I was not happy with Bock's role. On a positive and final note, I learned a new word, always fun. A librocubicularist is someone who reads in bed!

Set in 1918 the country is beggining to recover from the effects of WWI, and the adventurers have given up their life on the road with the Parnassus, their travelling caravan of books, and are now living in Brooklyn above their bookshop, 'Parnassus at Home'. Over the entrance is a sign that says 'Welcome! This shop is haunted' as Roger believes it is haunted by the 'ghosts of all great literature'. The shop is depicted as warm and comfortable with people are allowed to browse at will and settle down in comfy chairs to read the books, smoking if they wish so that there is always 'an all-pervasive drift of tobacco smoke, which eddied and fumed under the glass lampshades'.Into this cosy world arrive two young people, Aubrey Gilbert, a young man working in advertising, hoping to find himself a new client in Roger and the beautiful heiress,Titania Chapman, daughter of a wealthy businessman whose father has sent her to work in the bookshop to learn about real life. Nature takes its course and Aubrey is soon smitten with Titania and finds excuses to visit the shop. While doing so he discovers some strange goings-on leading to him trying out some amateur detective work to uncover a plot involving some German spies.

An erster Stelle steht hier nat\u00fcrlich der Buchh\u00e4ndler Roger Mifflin, der durch seine Liebe zu B\u00fcchern \u00fcberzeugt und immer das passende Zitat f\u00fcr jede Lebenssituation zur Hand hat. Seine Art macht ihn sympathisch, denn f\u00fcr ihn stehen immer die B\u00fccher und die Literatur im Vordergrund, nicht der Profit. Seine Frau Helen, die ich schon im Prequel super fand, bekommt in dieser Geschichte leider nur eine kleine Rolle. Daf\u00fcr lernen wir Titania kennen, eine junge Frau aus gutem Haus, die die Arbeit in der Buchhandlung beginnt und etwas frischen Wind zwischen die verstaubten Buchregale bringt.Die Geschichte lebt von ihren Charakteren, zeigt sich aber auch sehr gesellschaftskritisch, vor allem gegen\u00fcber dem 1. Weltkrieg, der kurz vor dem Einsetzen der Handlung endete. Der Autor l\u00e4sst durch seinen Protagonisten die Sinnlosigkeit eines solchen Krieges aufzeigen und pl\u00e4diert f\u00fcr den Frieden.Aber es geht nicht nur um B\u00fccher: Auch Spannung ist geboten, sodass der Leser auch in eine kleine Kriminalgeschichte verwickelt wird. Diese zieht sich zwar durch das ganze Buch, war f\u00fcr mich jetzt aber eher eine kleine, sch\u00f6ne Nebenhandlung mit einer Wendung, mit der ich gar nicht gerechnet habe.Der Schreibstil ist auch hier sehr klassisch, was mir sehr gut gefallen hat, da es sich super sch\u00f6n lesen l\u00e4sst und mal etwas ganz anderes ist. Sch\u00f6n sind auch die vielen Buchzitate, die in die Handlung integriert werden. Ich habe richtig Lust bekommen, wieder mehr Klassiker zu lesen, auch wenn es leider nicht alle erw\u00e4hnten B\u00fccher wirklich gibt.

We know immediately that this is no ordinary bookshop, as is stated on Mr. Mifflin's sign:Parnassus At HomeR. & H. MifflinBooklovers Welcome!This Shop Is HauntedIt's true that the \"Parnassus at Home\" is inhabited by many lively spirits and not all are among the living. And yet this is not a supernatural book. Rather, it refers to the ghosts of all great literature which haunt libraries and bookstores alike. The literary past and present collide to make an ideal atmosphere for life and love--all within a bookstore. The story begins with the arrival of Aubrey Gilbert, a young advertising man, at Mifflin's store. Gilbert has hopes of convincing Mifflin to become his firm's newest client. He does not convince the bookseller to invest in advertising, but he does become intrigued by Mifflin's convictions concerning the value of books and booksellers to the world. He becomes equally intrigued when he discovers that the daughter of his firm's biggest client has taken a job as assistant to Mifflin. As Gilbert spends more time at the shop, mysterious circumstances begin to happen. A copy of Thomas Carylyle's Letters & Speeches of Oliver Cromwell disappears and reappears with alarming frequency. A local pharmacist takes to entering the shop late at night. A chef at a local hotel advertises a reward for a lost copy of the Carlyle book. And Gilbert begins to suspect a plot to kidnap Titania, the wealthy client's daughter. Before the mystery is cleared up, the book disappears again and there is an explosive grand finale.The mystery itself is amusing and entertaining, though not terribly complex. The real charm of the book comes in the atmosphere and desciption of a Brooklyn of another time. And in the person of Roger Mifflin. Mr. Mifflin says all the things about books that I feel. He is not only a bookseller...but a true book lover. When I read this book, I did so with a notebook at my elbow to write down all the marvelous things that Mifflin says. Here is just a sample:There is no mistaking a real book when one meets it. It is like falling in love.Malnutrition of the reading faculty is a serious things. Let us prescribre for you.I mean my advertising is done by the books I sell. If I sell a man a book by Stevenson or Conrad, a book that delights or terrifies him, that man and that book become my living advertisements.There is no one so grateful as the man to whom you have given just the book his soul needed and he never knew it.Living in a bookshop is like living in a warehouse full of explosives. Those shelves are ranked with the most furious combustibles in the world--the brains of men.That's why I call this place the Haunted Bookshop. Haunted by the ghosts of books I haven't read. Poor uneasy spirits, they walk and walk around me. There's only one way to lay the ghost of a book and that's to read it.I could go on. But I won't. If you'd like to hear more of Mifflin's wisdom--or if you're interested in a mystery that takes place in a turn-of-the-previous-century bookstore, then you should read The Haunted Bookshop for yourself. A wonderful little book that rates four and half stars.First posted on my blog My Reader's Block. Please request permission before reposting.

Aqu\u00ed s\u00f3lo encuentras libros de calidad, de esos que valen la pena leer y que enriquecen el alma, seleccionados cuidadosamente por el due\u00f1o de local: Roger Mifflin, quien lo encuentras sentado en el centro de la librer\u00eda leyendo y fumando, dispuesto a platicar contigo todo el d\u00eda acerca de libros y m\u00e1s libros, si es que as\u00ed lo deseas. El se\u00f1or Mifflin es, me atrevo a decir, el Quijote de los libreros. Entregado a su vocaci\u00f3n, no se considera a s\u00ed mismo como un vendedor sino como un evangelizador de la buena literatura. Lo m\u00e1s entretenido del libro son las deliberaciones de Mifflin. El libro no ocupaba la trama de crimen y misterio al estilo Agatha Christie que el autor le dio para ser interesante. Con frases como \"Basta con mirarlo un instante para darse cuenta de que su mente padece una tremenda carencia de libros, y sin embargo, ah\u00ed sigue, dichosamente ignorante\" o \"\u00bfAcaso los aut\u00e9nticos amantes de los libros son gente nocturna, de la que s\u00f3lo se atreve a salir cuando la oscuridad y el silencio y el fulgor de las luces c\u00e1lidas induce irresistiblemente a la lectura?\", se convierte en un valioso tributo para los buenos libros y los amantes de ellos. Este libro es m\u00e1gico y pinta el para\u00edso de, yo creo, todas las personas que tenemos una cuenta en Goodreads. Si le di 4 y no 5 estrellas, es por la \"trama\" de crimen que se le agreg\u00f3, que a mi gusto estaba un poco de m\u00e1s. Tampoco me agrad\u00f3 mucho el aire de racismo que se siente en este libro, aunque supongo que es normal en un libro publicado en el a\u00f1o 1919, justo despu\u00e9s de terminarse la Primera Guerra Mundial.Terminar\u00e9 mi review con una bella frase de este libro con la cual te sentir\u00e1s identificado:\n\"Me entristece pensar que tendr\u00e9 que morir sin haber le\u00eddo miles de libros que habr\u00edan podido proporcionarme una felicidad noble e inmaculada\"\nAltamente recomendado."}, {"userName": "Tyler Jones", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2171826-tyler-jones", "userReview": "If ever a book preached to the choir, this is it for me. For over twenty years I worked as a bookseller; one of the most financially un-rewarding and fun jobs one can imagine. For most of those years I worked for a manager who had a passion for book selling, and instilled in me and my coworkers the thought that book selling was a truly noble profession; one that changed peoples lives for the better. Among other things I learned that the idea was to sell the customer the book they want, but don't know they want. I have not been a bookseller for over seven years now, but this fictional work about a second hand bookshop in 1919, captures that exact sense of the importance of book selling that I still feel.This is a light book. A funny and entertaining book. Great literature? Maybe not. Great fun? Most definitely. Most importantly, for me, it treats book selling as should be treated; as an important community service and a noble calling."}, {"userName": "Nikki ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nikki", "userReview": "I really couldn't love this as much as I did Parnassus on Wheels. It's still permeated with that love of books, and the romance is kind of sweet, but I preferred the more unconventional romance of Roger and Helen. Introducing a pretty young girl to be a figure of romance took away one of the things I loved about Parnassus on Wheels, even if Helen was still a character.Also, the mystery plot raised my eyebrows a bit. Doubtless of its time, but still. I would've preferred another paean to books and booksellers and unconventional romance. Although, on that note, some of the sections about books/bookselling just seemed rambling and preachy. Parnassus on Wheels is a slighter novel, and a tighter one."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/362843-jennifer", "userReview": "It seems impossible to read this without comparing it to the first book of Helen and Roger McGill, Parnassus on Wheels. While it's wonderful to revisit old friends, this book just didn't have the charm that the first had. And Helen is strangely minor in this book while Roger takes center stage. I missed Helen's voice which gave Parnassus so much of it's gumption and humor. If I'd read this book on it's own I probably would have been charmed by it more."}], "description": "This classic story of romance and intrigue in a Brooklyn bookstore is one of the most beloved mysteries of all time Aubrey Gilbert stops by the Haunted Bookshop hoping to sell his services as an advertising copywriter. He fails to accomplish his goal, but learns that Titania Chapman, the lovely daughter of his most important client, is a store assistant there. Aubrey returns to visit Titania and experiences a series of unusual events: He is attacked on his way home from the store, an obscure book mysteriously disappears and reappears, and two strange characters are seen skulking in a nearby alleyway. Aubrey initially suspects the bookstore\u2019s gregarious owner, Roger Mifflin, of scheming to kidnap Titania, but the plot he eventually uncovers is far more complex and sinister than he could have ever imagined. \u00a0 A charming ode to the art of bookselling wrapped inside a thrilling suspense story, The Haunted Bookshop is a must-read for bibliophiles and mystery lovers alike. \u00a0 This ebook has been professionally proofread to ensure accuracy and readability on all devices.", "title": "The Haunted Bookshop", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27872533-the-haunted-bookshop", "average": 3.65, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1448132702l/27872533.jpg", "reviews": 546, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/30802.Christopher_Morley", "name": "Christopher  Morley"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Writing", "Classics", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27872533-the-haunted-bookshop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/269689.The_Haunted_Bookshop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/609284.The_Haunted_Bookshop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2291837.The_Haunted_Bookshop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8647048-the-haunted-bookshop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17697841-la-librer-a-encantada", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22612118", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/947000.The_Haunted_Bookshop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17434198-the-haunted-bookshop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22436507-das-haus-der-vergessenen-b-cher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10077611-the-haunted-bookshop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16156345-the-haunted-bookshop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1001312.Parnassus_on_Wheels", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2235096.Kitty_Foyle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12393669-kathleen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/412004.Where_the_Blue_Begins", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2012173.Duet"]}
