Eve is an idiot. Why would you cross over yellow tape and go into an unmarked cave that only someone your size could fit through by yourself? Girl, you are lucky getting bit was the only thing that happened to you. Eve, Cam and Alex are the closest friends. They were all at a dig site when Eve decided to be an idiot and try to find something so life-altering, that they would name a prize after her.Well, she got the life altering part down. She got bit. By a zombie.There are about a zillion types of zombie lure out there. This one reminds me a little more of iZombie. She is still kind of human and can pass for human and such, but she still needs to feed on flesh and all that disgusting stuff. You don't get enough of this kind of paranormal, so I really loved that.The author took a lot of liberties with her folk tale and I appreciated that. She had a fresh pair of eyes on an over-done type of story and it was refreshing.The writing was a little out of bounds for me. It read young but felt young adult. I'm not sure why it is labeled New Adult, because there isn't any New Adult content in it. There was some gore, as it is expected with any zombie book, but it wasn't to the point that I was finding myself gagging from the details. There is a lot of room to grow with that. I would say that the relationships were kind of assumed, not shown, to the reader. You knew they were best friends and they talked as if they were best friends, but I didn't feel anything below a surfaced relationship between them. I appreciated the reach out by the author and hope she continues to learn from her work and to grow with her passion. She was a great story teller and I hope to hear more of her stories in the future.WrensReads | Twitter | Instagram"}, {"userName": "Joseph Phillips", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27752508-joseph-phillips", "userReview": "I was sent an e-book copy by the author for an honest review.The story, in my opinion, was quite a generic story with a good undertone during certain scenes, especially the fighting/zombie scenes.I enjoyed the way that the author created the origin for the zombie virus, which intertwined the original zombie style we all know and love and a twist of Egyptian history.The disease was cleverly written in, though there was a ton of foreshadowing before hand; I did enjoy how the author linked the events of Dr August\u2019s work colleague almost being chomped by a zombie in a room surrounded by hieroglyphs of hawks on every wall, then becoming a Zombie himself after a ton of Hawks peck his face practically off, which transmits the disease to the work colleague. There is a little bit more information about these scenes but I won\u2019t spoil all of it.The story was pretty solid mostly all of the way through, until the ending, it suddenly started to break down in terms of enthusiasm? I felt as if the author went for a generic ending, which wasn\u2019t great honestly as it made the book seem very Deus Ex Machina in a way. There were also quite a few cringe worthy and cheesy bits during the final few chapters\u2026 some that weren\u2019t really needed at-all.I did enjoy the middle section that involved quite heavy fight scenes and a more intense zombie structure.I did enjoy the premise of the story though, like how a zombie could contract the Azreal virus and become like Eve, super strong and have enhanced healing powers, this allowed for a strong dynamic during the fight scenes and the dramatising of the characters and their scenes.And it was a good take on how a person with this virus explains and feels the changes from Zombie to Human. I did like that aspect on it as normally these days we see how people would survive during a zombie apocalypse and not how a human/zombie couldn\u2019t retain a zombie apocalypse especially one which could be created by them.I didn\u2019t like how it was all in first person either, as I didn\u2019t feel connected to any character during it due to the fact most of the context was stated \u2018I said\u2019. I mean, for example in Cam\u2019s paragraphs we see Eve show emotion but since the paragraph is focused on Cam, I felt as if we should feel so much more from emotion him?This goes for the other two aswell; I didn\u2019t feel the raw emotion that you would if it was written in Third person.I also didn\u2019t catch the bit when Cam and Eve become Boyfriend and Girlfriend, I mean yes they do kiss in a couple of scenes but that doesn\u2019t automatically make you Boyfriend/Girlfriend even if you have liked that person for as long as they did. It would\u2019ve seemed so much more realistic if they actually had an ickle romance scene\u2026 it would\u2019ve been stupidly cheesy, but way more convincing.Okay\u2026 so, I kind-of didn\u2019t really like any of the main characters in this, I could tolerate Eve but that was about it.Don\u2019t get me wrong, they were good characters, but I felt as if they were very stereotypical characters?Eve was the MAIN character we followed through this book as the Zombie virus was passed onto her, automatically we focus upon her as the strong, badass female, which she is, again don\u2019t get me wrong but I felt as if her \u2018badass-ness\u2019 wasn\u2019t at the fullest potential the author could create.But she is also this hot headed girl who always seems to know what to say and what to do in certain situations, even if the situation seems so unrealistic and very fabricated, in the sense of a fictional reality.Also\u2026 she does get a tad few creepy thoughts towards cam at the end of the book\u2026Nether-the-less, Eve was possibly my favourite character out of the three.Alex was Eve\u2019s best friend and was the \u2018pretty\u2019 one of the trio.I can\u2019t say that Alex did much during this book but act as the middle-woman between Cam and Eve\u2019s relationship.I don\u2019t really know what to say about Alex as she didn\u2019t really do much, I mean yes she was at the dig site and helped Eve when she turned a few times, but she mostly comforted Eve when her and Cam kept falling out.Cam\u2026 Ugh\u2026 honestly, I\u2019ve never been so annoyed at a character in my entire life\u2026I didn\u2019t like how the author made him out to be this Manly character saying things like \u2018I choke back the some tears at the thought. I\u2019m a man, after all\u2019 Like seriously you can still be manly if you cry, its just an emotion? I get why the author has done it, to make Cam seem like a masculine guy but it doesn\u2019t work honestly.And considering his dad was an alcoholic/abuser, the way he snaps and hurts women the way he does questions his Manliness, like he punches a girl in the tit\u2026 don\u2019t do that, that\u2019s not cool, considering the weight difference between these two characters (one being a tall lean man, the other being an average height and average build girl, from what I perceived) he could\u2019ve just pushed her off of him with a slight amount of added force?I don\u2019t know\u2026 I just felt as if the author tried to glorify this character, as he was a love interest, while subtly glossing over the fact he was literally his father, even though he didn\u2019t want to become him.Overall, I did enjoy this story, as it was a fun and quick read.The zombie element of the book is great and refreshing, but I did feel as if it turned more into an Urban-Fantasy type of book rather than this action-y/horror-y type of deal.Thank you so much for the author for supplying me with a copy of this book!I also have the sequel so look for that in the near future.Joe (BookolioBlog)"}, {"userName": "Stephen Kozeniewski", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22484998-stephen-kozeniewski", "userReview": "I was delighted to receive an advanced reader's copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.Equal parts sexy and gory, hilarious and heartwrenching, EVE BRENNER: ZOMBIE GIRL is an astonishing debut. I can think of little to compare it to outside of Stuart Gordon's film version of Lovecraft's RE-ANIMATOR.It's rare to read a debut novel written with such confidence, not to mention such momentum. EVE BRENNER covers a lot of ground: geographically from small-town Canada to the Egyptian ruins and back again, and emotionally from a tight-knit trio starting college together to total zombie pandemonium.The story begins as our eponymous heroine is learning about ancient Egyptian anthropology and stumbles upon a taboo gravesite, where she is infected after a strange scuffle. For our characters, Eve's new condition is a mystery, though I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the audience will have guessed from the third word of the title what Eve has become.And from a beginning so well-trodden as to be almost a clich\u00e9, EVE BRENNER takes a hard left turn deep into undiscovered territory. Combining elements of the zombie, mummy, werewolf, and vampire mythoses, Eve is nevertheless a unique monster. She and her best friends from childhood, Cameron and Alex, must come to grips with Eve's burgeoning bloodlust as they are also learning the ropes of college and adulthood. The classic coming-of-age tale and questioning of childhood relationships that comes with that territory is thrown on its ear when your childhood friend turns into a bloodthirsty monster. Cameron's long unrequited crush on Eve suddenly becomes a dangerous, potentially lethal liability. Eve's hiking trip to Lover's Lane one night (easily the highlight of the book for me) turns from an abortive m\u00e9nage a trois into an orgy of violence. This book is packed with love bites that lead into braineating, soft caresses that end with rending flesh, and romantic rivalries that turn into one-armed chainsaw duels. Giacomi has truly accomplished a feat with this novel and, as I said, I can't think of anything else quite like it.I'm eager to gobble down the next three books in this promising new series. EVE BRENNER is a great book and Eve Brenner is a great character. I'm terrified to admit I've fallen in love with both, especially knowing what happens to everyone who falls in love with the zombie girl..."}, {"userName": "Happy Booker", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67995272-happy-booker", "userReview": "Eve Brenner Zombie is the first young adult book, in its series. The story revolves around Eve and her two friends, Cam and Alex. All three of them travel to Egypt for some adventure. Eve mysteriously gets touched by something in a sealed tomb. She begins to see things psychically change about her and as much as she can hide it at first, the symptoms start to take over. Her mission then becomes to find out how she can humanize herself again and she isn\u2019t alone. Her friends are with her all the way.I enjoyed the dynamic between the three friends. The character development was accomplished very well. The teens were relatable and had flaws in their decision making. Their personalities were individualized which added to the realistic nature of things. I particularly appreciated the fact that the lead character wanted to maintain her human side. Her love interest did not dominate the story, which is what normally happens in YA books, and that added to the quality of the story.The literature standard, for a debut novel, was outstanding. I barely noticed any structural of editing issues. The author has succeeded in maintaining sufficient backstory and descriptive content to support the plot. I believe this would and the material within the content is very suitable for the age and genre of its audience.I recommend this book to zombie lovers and young adult fans."}, {"userName": "Shana Festa", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9185553-shana-festa", "userReview": "Eve Brenner. College student turned zombie-ish, turned vigilante zombie killer, turned definite zombie? The beginning of Zombie Girl sets the tone for a total lack of common sense from the main character. I mean, she's in a cave on an anthropology dig, and doesn't think to carry a flashlight when she wanders off alone in the dark? Okay, so I could almost forgive that, but then why cross the yellow caution tape? If anything that should have been a major duh moment for her. So, I guess she pretty much deserves the bad luck since she brought it on herself. Though, I guess if we're placing blame, she shouldn't bear the burden all alone...maybe it should be shared with Dr August for knowingly bringing the group to a dig site with a frighteningly dark secret. A secret that he, himself, had a hand in burying.I struggled to come up with a star rating for this one, I couldn't decide if it was a three or four star book--so I settled on 3.5 stars. The changes in tensing isn't as seamless as I would generally prefer. As a personal preference, I tend not to favor narration in the present tense. I find it a bit abrasive and hard to follow along with a story. There's a mix of narrative vs. exposition, where the structure changes depending on who's PoV is currently being shared. For example, when Dr August shares his experience, it's written using exposition and is a means to relay important information to the reader. That being said, I enjoyed the bones of the story. It was an intriguing splash of uniqueness and I appreciate the creative liberties the author took. A mix of self-aware and mindless undead will appeal to a wider audience and whether or not it was intentional on the author's part, it is a smart conceptual choice. Marketing is quite possibly the bane of an author's existence, or at least the bane of mine. And I think the publisher isn't pushing this book under the right category. It's being categorized as New Adult, but it is really Young Adult. There's no graphic gore or sexy time, and the language is fairly tame with a light dusting of curse words. In doing research, I've found YA can range from the 12-25 age range, but delving deeper shows 12-16 as teen. So I feel a good sampling would be 16-25. While do feel the content is appropriate for readers that prefer less horror with their horror, the niche for this book would be perfect in the YA genre. Food for thought, and I fed the author my thoughts personally lol.Rereading my review, I realize it may sound like a negative one, but it's not. I don't regret the time spent reading Zombie Girl, and I connected with some of the secondary characters even though I'm not totally sold on the book's namesake because I struggled with many of her choices. I suspect had the book been marketed as YA my expectations would have been different and it likely would have affected how I reviewed the book. As a reviewer, I need to put myself in the right mindset for a book. I need to know going int something what key points and milestones to look for, and as an adult book, it didn't hit them.That being said, I hope my review doesn't dampen the author's spirits but instead generates some reflection on her part in moving forward. I've had the pleasure of meeting her on social media and she is a lovely girl. If she chooses to write more in the Zombie Girl universe, I see a few avenues that could enhance the series. Either rebrand as YA or go through it again to make the content somewhat more mature. What I wouldn't want to see happen is keeping the book categorized a NA and just upping the ante in subsequent books. I say this because the risk of alienating readers that would have likely continued on in the series is a key point to consider. I look forward to seeing how the story progresses."}, {"userName": "Reader's Hollow", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37382559-reader-s-hollow", "userReview": "Zombies often get shoved under the horror genre. This one, however, felt more like an urban fantasy. There are still some great horror elements, (as there are with most urban fantasies) but it was heavily focused on the main character and her evolution. I really liked the difference here. Plus, I'm an urban fantasy groupie, sooooo...Eve Brenner is someone I immediately liked with her lame jokes and tough attitude. She'll defend her friends and family to the death - literally. The p.o.v. changes between Eve and her two closest friends, Alex and Cam. At first I thought they were somewhat one-dimensional but as the story progressed I saw the subtle quirks and the vast differences between the three. I started to relate to each of them separately and for completely different reasons.The pacing was great and kept me on my toes. Considering I read this in less than two days, (work days) should tell you that I was highly engrossed. Eve could have been both the hero and the enemy and she struggles to find a balance between the two.There was one point where I thought it should be over but a new twist was added and I'm under the spell of the story yet again.The author made zombies cool. She added lore, action, gore, humanity and a smidge of romance. Eve, Alex and Cam were all very relatable characters in their flaws, likes and quirks. I had a hard time putting the story down and I'd recommend this to zombie-fans, urban fantasy fans and horror fans alike.Full Review @ thereadershollow.com"}, {"userName": "L.E.

The story itself starts well, however the return home in the second third was a weak middle, thankfully redeemed by the strong ending.The book starts with an introduction to Eve, she is glib and sassy - the kind of character and introduction that really isn't my particular cup of tea. That said, I immediately took a liking to the idea of her being called Eve. Although it could seem quite obvious, I liked the idea of her being the first (zombie) woman.We first meet our three lead characters, Eve and her friends Cameron and Alexandra on an academic archaeological excavation in Egypt. As interesting as this setting and the story was I have to admit I possibly had a bias reaction to the portrayal of the dig - which in no way resembled any kind of dig, archaeologists or archaeology students I have ever encountered in the course of my own archaeological training or work in heritage. Even so, to the lay person I believe this would be an interesting and hooking introduction. The exposition we later learn - the idea of a \"Mummy\" as a zombie and an ancient Egyptian disease - is pretty interesting and definitely a concept not really touched on in much contemporary zombie fiction.When the characters return home and to college the story picks up pace - we get to see the inevitable consequences of Eve\u2019s actions and her attack whilst on the excavation. We learn more about the \u201cdisease\u201d itself and the involvement of government agents, which is an interesting yarn. The lives and backgrounds of the characters are explored more in this home setting. However, the death of a family member and return home feels a bit too long and lacking in really gripping action.This weak middle is definitely made up for in the strength of the last few chapters. Our characters return once more to college, as Eve\u2019s condition both worsens and is better explored with the help of a professor at the college. The rise of college zombie hordes and inevitable appearance of the agents is where this story really finds its feet. It's a shame this comes so late, but for me it saves the story and piques my interest in the next installment.I really loved the story being told, however there were weaknesses that let it down for me which lead me to giving it just three stars. The tone is often all over the place, the flip attitude of the characters not always quite adding up with the gore and violence.Jumping into the different characters each chapter is quite a good way to expand a first person narrative, a drawback in this case being that the characters all trends to have, if not the same, very similar internal voices. Overall this ends up not being used as effectively as it could have been and it feels that the story would have been stronger if in the third person. Although we learn past events via this method I didn't find it gave me any greater connection to the characters and so still only know them superficially by the end of the novel. First person can be a great way to explore character thoughts and feelings but this wasn't used to the full potential that it could have been - a real missed opportunity in exploring deeper Eve's experience.That said, the ending was gripping and the \u201ctwo years later\u201d final chapter building to the sequel takes us in an intriguing new direction that I will definitely be looking forward to reading more about."}, {"userName": "Bri", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31757035-bri", "userReview": "What I liked: This book is packed with action that I wasn't expecting when I started it. I wasn't expecting something like this story, I imagined a much more toned down type of story but I'm glad I was surprised by this change with how everything happened. The way Eve's new condition is handled, from how she obtained it to how she was trying to control herself, was fascinating and enthralling. I thought Eve was a great character herself, even though I did have a kind of hard time connecting with her in the beginning. The changing of point of view between Eve, Cam, and Alex was something that, for the most part, I enjoyed reading as it gave a different perspective about the situation from different characters.What I didn't like: I actually didn't like Cam, he seemed overly-masculine (which, given how boys are told to act to be men today that doesn't surprise me) but at the same time, he seemed too aggressive and it bothered me a bit with how he acted. I don't think he sees it, but he's becoming like the person he doesn't want to be and I get that's realistic, it just made me feel really distanced from him as a character overall and I ended up no liking him.Overall Review: I felt like this story read more like a YA book than a NA book for the most part. Nothing is graphic in the sense that it would be safer to market it as a NA book rather than YA in my opinion, although I probably would classify it as an Upper YA book. Also, maybe third person would have worked better for this story with how it was told. With that aside, this story was a lot of fun to read and I did enjoy seeing how it played out. The characters, most of them anyway, were enjoyable and I liked them. While Eve does make questionable choices, I had to remember this is a horror story and (always) the characters don't make the best decisions which leads them into what ever situation they end up in. Expected pieces aside as well, Eve was a character who I enjoyed following through the story as she tries to learn to cope with whats happening to her. While I didn't connect with Cam at all, Alex was a character who I think I liked, but I'm not completely sure because she didn't seem to, overall, have a strong impact on the story for me.Recommend?: This was a good zombie story, and if you want a different kind of spin on zombie stories check this one out!"}, {"userName": "Jeremiah Israel", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28658259-jeremiah-israel", "userReview": "The great thing about Eve Brenner is that you get to experience her zombie infection from her perspective. As if college, friends and growing up in general wasn't hard enough, Eve also deals with zombie changes unlike any form of infection yet. Actually, the infection is a lot closer to a superpower than it is to what the traditional decaying zombie has. Watching the character grow and develop with this definitely made for an exciting read.I found myself happily cringing at the gnarly bits and smiling at the quirky ones. Eve navigates life, friendship and romance as her situation becomes more and more complicated. Beat by beat, things get out of hand until the epic conclusion and serious cliffhanger that left me in serious need of reading the next book. Zombie Girl is a lot of fun and I definitely recommend it for anyone that's up for a cool coming of age story with awesome zombie action. I have never been envious of any zombie's infection until Eve Brenner. My favorite parts were when she displayed her abilities.

I like zombie stories, in fact the Resident Evil movies are some of my favorites. (Don't judge, you wish you were that badass too.) So of course I said yes to reviewing the book.The novel was told in three (main) alternating point of views: Eve, Cameron, and Alex. Eve and her two friends were on a dig site when Eve decided to explore on her own and something attacked her. As time passed, her new zombie status became more and more apparent.In a way, Eve was kind of like a daywalker that you see in some vampire novels/movies. Only zombiefied. She was dead, had some new abilities, and needed a diet overhaul, but she still retained her memories and thought capacity. If she kept herself full, it was almost as if nothing was wrong. The whole thing made the zombie aspect of this novel fun and interesting. I'm not sure how much of the mythology behind the zombie status I buy, once we finally learned it, but I can't complain about the direction it took the story.Eve was interesting, and bitten Eve was far better than prezombie Eve. She started out, not selfish per say, but focused on herself. She was looking for the adventure/discovery she imagined she would have on the dig in Egypt, so she ignored the safety barriers put in place to keep people out. Exploring the new area was what changed her life when a creature gnawed on her arm. I liked that she was brave and strong, because it made things so much more believable as I watched her become this other, and better person.I have to admit, I did not like Cameron at all. Cam was the best friend, the one that we couldn't date because it would change the whole friendship. He was handsome and amusing, and all the girlies loved him. Even Eve. The attraction from both sides was obvious from the get go; there was no way this book was ending without a kiss. I could see why he might like Eve, she was fun and adventurous, yet also loyal and protective. But looking back at Cameron, all I can think of was he was a wuss. Think male damsel in distress and you won't be that far off. I really, really had a hard time with his background/story arc. Cameron's father was a drunk and abused him on what sounded like a regular bases. Land in the hospital, you're lucky to be alive, kind of beatings. Cameron had tough person potential and he could have easily defended himself, except he froze every time. I can completely understand the mental aspect of abuse and why he kind of shut down. Yet Cameron was so focused on his love for his father that his actions later on towards a certain individual after certain events was way too aggravating. By all means, lets back the man that almost killed you over those who stood beside you and would have done anything for you.I liked Alex more than I liked Cameron, but not as much as Eve. She was interesting, but I think we could have been ok without her point of view. At times it felt like she was being set up to be Cameron's rebound love interest, and others it was as if she could have been the puppetmaster tossing Eve and Cameron together. I don't think her point of view added anything new until very late in the story, but that could have been worked around.Zombie Girl was one of those novels that had a slow start. It took a bit for me to get into these character's heads and care about their struggles. Going back to college and how much time we spent there before digging into the who, where, what, when, whys of Eve's attack kept things at that pace. But once things got moving, the story got captivating. I really wanted to know how Eve was going to fix the mess she made, and save the day like the hero she could be.

I would say the book is more humor and budding awkward romance, than it is anything in the horror genre, so don't see the word zombies and think horror.

After Eve recovers from the attack, she is not the same. She is able to rapidly heal, food won\u2019t stay down and she has periods of lost memory. Concerned for Eve, Cam and Alex take her to see Dr. August to find out what she may have contracted in the ancient plagued city in Egypt; the answer isn't quite what they expect. Now, Eve and her friends try to deal with her new abilities on top of college and family drama with Cam\u2019s abusive father. This was not what I was expecting in a zombie book at all, but I really enjoyed the different combination of an ancient Egyptian curse mixed with zombie lore. It made the book unexpected and had the possibility of many different outcomes and not just the same old zombie apocalypse setting. Eve was a great character, at nineteen she is very smart, but does not have her life figured out yet. Her friends Alex and Cam are unconditionally supportive and are like family to her, which makes Eve\u2019s deeds much easier to deal with. The narrative switches between Eve, Alex and Cam which creates a fast-paced read. Cam's character stole the moment many times and the dynamic with her father made a very interesting story. I'm interested to see what else Eve can figure out about herself and her abilities, all of the testing and the different powers or abilities that each zombie had was very intriguing. I also want to see where Eve and Cam's relationship will go. I was really impressed with Eve's decisions at the end, it showed how she had grown and matured, even if she was really dead. Overall, a unique new-adult/ zombie read, I'll definitely be checking out the next book.

A student on an archeological dig is attacked when she goes poking around an old tomb in Egypt. Obviously it was some kind of zombie (clue's in the title!) but it's the kind that can be explained through science and magic.Eve learns that everyone reacts different to this particular brand of zombie virus and is fortunate to discover that she has some control over her new impulses. Her two best friends, Cam and Alex are aware of her... condition and try their best to help her control it but it soon becomes clear that they're out of their depth and we discover what happens when a zombie outbreak hits a small town university.I adored the story, the mythology and the premise but I did find that the book had a wicked case of 'debut novel syndrome', the author hasn't yet found her voice and confidence but I have no fear in following this series forwards - the storyline and characters are very strong, once Giacomi finds her unique style then there'll be no stopping her.The romance part of this book was a little cheesy, with a lot of longing glances and 'she's my world'... a bit overstated for my liking and could do with moving a little more towards the subtlety of describing the emotions and actions of the characters rather than a flashing billboard of teen emotion.Eve is a fantastic and strong character, both physically and in personality. She starts kicking ass when the undead start attacking and the violence has the perfect level of gore, though I did giggle that a lot of the supporting characters must be walking around perma-concussed with the number of times they're hit over the head and kidnapped.This is going to be the YA zombie series to follow if you like mythology, government conspiracy and kickass girls. I can't wait to read what happens next!"}, {"userName": "Trista Borgwardt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19386663-trista-borgwardt", "userReview": "Eve Brenner is a new and inviting zombie series. This book opens up to Eve and her friends at an archeological site in Egypt. Eve Brenner, the ever curious stumble across a site that she is supposed to stay away from, but she can't help herself. She just wants to make 'the great discovery'. Well, what a great discovery she did find...but not what she had in mind. While she is searching this 'off-limits' area she is attacked by some being that mangles up her arm. She is saved by her friends who will throw themselves in the face of danger for her. Eve spends the next few days recovering before they have to head back home and to their next year in college. Eve is bummed, and shocked as she notices strange changes in herself. Once back, her friends Cameron and Alex help her cope with the changes going on in her body and have to begin to be more careful around her. The blood lust that consumes her will take over with no notice and it does not discriminate. This of course is the time that Eve begins to develop a relationship with her longtime friend putting his life in danger with every kiss, but the remainder of her humanity as she would have to live with the consequences should she hurt him. Eve fights internally with herself and her love for Cameron while she fights with Cameron's stalker. There are several amazingly gory and bloody scenes in this book, which I absolutely enjoyed. I love the possession like state that Eve experiences and the different levels of zombies. This book is filled with non-stop action from the very beginning but still manages to throw in some romance, heartbreak and the strain that being a zombie has on one's friendships. This book is well written with confidence and competence and the details leave an amazing picture in your head.

I was unbelievably excited when I read the synopsis as I love zombies of all kinds. I was delighted to find a new zombie series to get my teeth into!This zombie book was funny, heartwarming and extremely entertaining with just the right amount of gore.When Eve starts displaying strange symptoms after a bite from a monstrous creature during an archaeological dig in Egypt, \u00a0the action quickly mounts. Egypt, tombs and\u00a0Egyptian artifacts have always interested me and I loved the scenes set there. I hope Eve returns there later on the series!!Eve is a flawed character, just like the rest of us, and that\u2019s why I liked her do much! She\u2019s straightforward, impatient and her friends mean everything to her. She puts some people\u2019s noses out of joint but cares so much about the people she loves. In Zombie form this is heightened and I\u2019ll let you decide if you like her or not.I liked seeing the story from all three of the main characters \u2013 Eve, Cam and Alex. Eve\u2019s friends Alex and Cam support Eve all the way. I hope my friends treat me the same if I ever become infected! Friendship, family and blossoming romance are surprisingly at the heart of this book. Eve\u2019s little circle of friends reminded me in the best way of the Scooby gang.My favourite parts of the book were the action scenes. I could see them as vividly as if I was watching an action movie.\u00a0I don\u2019t know if I can pick a downside but the only thing I can say is it ended on a real cliffhanger, making the reader want to jump straight into the next book. I\u2019m not totally sure it could stand alone outside of the series but that\u2019s just fine with me as I adored book 1 and am dying to read the next books in the series!I\u2019d recommend this to teens upwards who like gory, thrilling and adrenaline filled reads with a dash of romance"}, {"userName": "Autumn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7383239-autumn", "userReview": "http://alittlebitofrnr.com/review-eve...I received this book to give an honest review. If you like zombies then I think you will like this book. I have always been a huge zombie fan, the more blood and gore the better. Though with this one not too much gore but it is there. So we are introduced to Eve who is a college student and is in Egypt with some classmates and professor. When she enters into a forbidden place that is when things start to go down hill. She becomes the undead. Though we slowly get answers to why the professor was in that certain place where things happen. Eve is good at keeping a secret especially one like this but yet when her friends find out they are there to help her in anyway. Those are true friends. Eve tries to curb the hunger but that might not work, especially when we get to the ending! Can you say CLIFFHANGER!!! Now while dealing with Eve and trying to keep her secret under wraps she starts a dilemma that will cause a whole lot of deaths. Though it seems that\u00a0our government friends seem to know about everything. So will Eve be safe? Or will they use her as a weapon? \u00a0Her best friend Cameron has his own things going on and will find himself in the crosshairs of a zombie who will stop at nothing to get him. Alex is there too back her friends up and goes in fighting when she can. I am not sure how much more I can write on the review because I feel like I will give away a lot of things.

I wanted something really realistic and contemporary about zombies. And that premise was a great one, and certain times in the book it was really cool. But the main problem was the writing.It may have just been the advance copy, but it looked like it wasn\u2019t edited at all and I had to resist the urge to get out my red pen. There were a few main issues that I can\u2019t help but point out:-Most of the time when there should have been a period, there was a comma, so as many as 4 sentences could be combined in one.-Dialogue was funky\u2014sometimes it wasn\u2019t punctuated properly or capitalized.-The tense changed about a million times. Sometimes there would be as many as three different tenses in one sentence. It was not continuous at all. I gave up trying to figure it out after the first few pages.And it wasn\u2019t just the editing, it was the character dialogue and actions. Sometimes it was cheesy and other times it was just plain unrealistic.But the fight scenes were good and the ideas and premise were good. The plot wasn\u2019t too bad, just kinda typical. It lost a bit of excitement at the end but then ended on a nice cliffhanger. I liked the characters too. They were realistic enough, for the most part.If the writing was better, I would possibly continue the series. But I wanted to put the book down at like page 7 because of it.

I like all sorts of zombie books, and have found some very interesting ones, in my search for new reads. However, when I was given this book in exchange for my honest review, I didn\u2019t expect to find a new style of zombie read that I would become completely addicted to!!This book starts of as simple as others, with life being normal and the characters not knowing what is about to happen. We have a decent amount of time to get to know the characters, a bit, which I liked, as I wanted to know Eve before the complete turn.I loved that this book had a slightly new take on how the zombie change came about. It was great to see it not only be slightly different in how it was transmitted, but also we had a great blend of a few types of \u2018monsters/creatures\u2019 blended to create the type of zombie girl Eve becomes.The perspective we were given, from Eve\u2019s point of view, was exciting. There was a blend of the zombie life, terror and fear, as well as bloodlust, and there was also a lot of normal university life blended into the story, adding love, happiness and moments of snarky little laughs.The pace of this book was spot on. It really grabbed me as a reader and kept me along for the ride. I found it increasingly hard to put this book down, as I delved deeper into Eve\u2019s new life.I am very excited to where Eve\u2019s story goes next and really think this is a series I will have to read every book in, and will eagerly await each new instalment."}, {"userName": "Christina  Torretta", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8264810-christina-torretta", "userReview": "Started to really love Eve at the beginning of this. She gets herself into some trouble and the premise is excited and quite scary! I know I would have freaked out if I were in her shoes.But... then... I don't know what happens. It gets a little lackluster. I didn't fall in love with Eve even after the fun, yet scary, beginning. I do like her jokes but never really felt totally in love with her, sadly. None of the characters really made me cheer for them. I'm not sure what was lacking with Eve as she is a strong, sarcastic gal, and normally I love that! The others, but especially Cam, kind of just annoyed me. And the changing of the point of view probably did not help. Just as I was getting to understand a character, the pov changes...With all the zombie books that I have read in the last few years though, this one will definitely stand out. It is unique and I loved the setting! Although after the initial attack on Eve it gets slow. But still, I enjoyed it for the most part. And I always love when a horror has some really good horrific parts!In short: It was good. Not my favorite zombie book of the year but it definitely has some potential. I think I would have preferred if Eve told the entire story."}, {"userName": "Toni", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13706669-toni", "userReview": "I am always thrilled to have the opportunity to read a zombie book! I had never heard of this author before, so the anticipation of sinking my teeth into some fresh meat had me salivating.Eve Brenner: Zombie Girl has a unique premise and a very creative underlying story, which is an important aspect of any book in this genre. I was really digging (pun intended) the story after first cracking it open. Eve had me super excited about her tale! I wish that feeling would have held strong throughout, but unfortunately it loses a bit of steam as it progresses. I had a difficult time connecting with/relating to Eve. Her choices irritated me, for the most part. Luckily, there is life beyond the main character in this story. The secondary characters and the action scenes are what saved this one for me. While there are parts of the book that made me roll my eyes and want to punch the wall, there was enough meat on these bones to keep me chewing.This may not be a 5-star book, and I can\u2019t deny that I was a little disappointed by that realization, but it\u2019s certainly a good debut novel.

EVE BRENNER: ZOMBIE GIRL is told through three narrators: Eve, and her best friends Alex and Cam. I enjoyed how EVE BRENNER: ZOMBIE GIRL is a tale of human vs. animalistic (base) instincts. The fight scenes were well-executed, but to me the romance aspects didn\u2019t flow naturally. Eve\u2019s struggle with her altered nature is what really drew me into the book and Eve was definitely my favorite character.
