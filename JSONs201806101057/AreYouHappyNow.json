ARE YOU HAPPY NOW? brings us into the world of lead character John Lincoln, executive editor for a small Chicago publisher. Lincoln is still young, early thirties, but he feels his career chances and his overall general lot in life has stalled. He\u2019s on a \u201cmarriage vacation\u201d from his wife, but she is in no rush to reconcile; he fears for his job, being laid off if the market doesn\u2019t pick up; and a strange man shows up one day threatening to sue him after an incident on the L train.You feel for Lincoln, as he wonders if he\u2019ll be stuck forever in the rut he\u2019s in. He wonders why everything in his life is so ambiguous. Either \u201che\u2019s accused of a crime or not. He\u2019s in good standing at his job or not. He\u2019s married or he\u2019s not. Where are the hard edges? How do you turn a corner when everything around you is curved?\u201d Something\u2019s gotta give. Lincoln dreams of discovering the book that will make his editing career, get him noticed, and let him escape Chicago for publishing\u2019s capital, New York. His desire to leave grows as his marriage worsens and after he is blackmailed into publishing a collection of bland poetry. When the new editorial assistant, Amy, confesses that she is a writer and has a good idea for a sexy novel, Lincoln takes her under his wing and encourages her to write the book, which he\u2019ll then edit into something commercial. He sees it as his opportunity, the thing that he was looking for to \u201cpropel him the fuck out of this place.\u201d At least, that\u2019s his plan.One thing that I especially like about this novel is the characters never fall into a stereotype; the plot, too, takes detours just when you think it might take the predictable road. As John Lennon said, Life is what happens to you while you\u2019re busy making other plans. And it\u2019s the other things that happen which may end up making you happy, not what you thought (or planned).Amazon Publishing has scored with this novel. I really hated to see it end, and that is a very rare thing indeed. I just hope it\u2019s late-in-the-year publication date doesn\u2019t prevent this gem from making end of the year best-of lists."}, {"userName": "Irma", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10632640-irma", "userReview": "Ok..so this was a totally different read for me...totally not what I expected but walked away with the sheer satisfaction that this book came into my life.Set in my home town of Chicago, this author knew his shit for sure, as I took the journey with him as he took me through every facet, nook and cranny of the city I love with all my heart. John Lincoln is a senior editor of a Chicago publishing company looking for his answer to....I guess...as the title says it all...being HAPPY. Through his work which he loves dearly, his marriage which is falling apart and his personal life which takes him in all sorts of directions ...he goes through the \"mundane\" of trying to just find \"THE\" answers that will take him to the top of his career. He develops friendships that he didn't think could ever come about...friendships that would allow him the answers needed to find his \"being happy\"...At the same time thinking that moving to New York will be the answer to his quest. Why would he want to leave the best city in the world??? Does he really think that all will be resolved when he moves to NYC??? I don't want to give out any spoilers but let's just say when he decided at the end where he needed and wanted to be...I was a proud momma knowing that he chose wisely.The writing is impeccable and the book maintained a steady pace and there was angst in all the right places. I personally loved the dialogue between him and a certain poet that came to his life unexpectedly...it was actually quite poignant how these two became friends...and yes..there is a little romance that develops that will play a big role in John's decision to do what he has to do to find his \"being happy\"...\"Are you Happy Now\" starts out a little slow...but once the foundation of the characters are built, the storlyline will take you places...so to speak...and John Lincoln not only finds his \"happy\" he gains a lot more that what he anticipated and me as the reader closes this book with the question....Am I happy now???"}, {"userName": "Willow Brook", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2414879-willow-brook", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this story. John Lincoln is an editor in a small publishing company based in Chicago (which the author did a great job of describing). He is an East Coast transplant who dreams of leaving the Midwest and his dreary job to work for a big publisher in New York. Lincoln is dour, cynical, snobby, and wildly insecure. He plots to have a coworker produce a best seller to leverage a job in New York. Meanwhile, he is blackmailed by a professor of happiness and then things really start to fall apart. Lincoln isn't a bad man (though he behaves very badly in a moment of panic) and as he strives to achieve success and deals with a variety of misfortune, he slowly matures and begins to find happiness. I liked watching his transformation, much of it due to the way people responded to him. By the end of the book I liked Lincoln, enjoyed his journey and wished him well. A very pleasant read."}, {"userName": "Vanessa / Little Gold Pixel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1954030-vanessa-little-gold-pixel", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would at the outset.

NOT OK.Even as the book got better, and the character started to change a little, I still couldn't stop thinking about how he treated that woman.

The book is written ostensibly in the third person, but it comes off as all being written from the perspective of the main character, John Lincoln, and it\u2019s all written in the present tense, so it \u201cfeels\u201d first person. There also is a certain \u201creportorial\u201d feel about it \u2013 the author/protagonist often tells you explanatory detail about events or processes or places much as you would read in a newspaper or magazine (as perhaps befits a novel written by a longtime magazine editor), and tells you what happened, instead of letting the participants\u2019 actions or dialogue do that job. There are very few literary \u201cflourishes\u201d (i.e., there is a lot of \u201cplot action\u201d for 300 pages), although I would categorize this as a literary novel nevertheless. And there was something strikingly self-referential (which I can\u2019t quite put my finger on) about this being a novel written by a longtime editor, and which must have been edited by another editor, about the life of an editor as he edits non-fiction books and novels in great need of editing. I guess you write best what you know best.All that said, this is a witty, dryly humorous and fun read. The main characters are distinct and well-contrasted, albeit not with a great deal of depth. The mildly charming protagonist has many foibles, and grows and matures throughout the course of the book, but (realistically) only somewhat. The plot and relationships among the characters take several twists and turns, many of which are not at all predictable. The book conveys insights \u2013 mostly through satirically rendered and sometimes almost absurd events, situations and conversations \u2013 into both the traditional publishing business and the currently ongoing electronic publishing revolution, with particular insight into the impact that revolution is having on old-school publishing. There are several clever or disguised plot or literary intricacies. E.g., (semi-spoiler alert) there are connections between the books being edited within the story and the storyline itself that one only perceives gradually. Indeed, only now that I have sat down to think about this novel and write this review do I suspect/realize that the joke was on me all along: there is a literary reason for the distinctive nature of the writing style of the novel, on which I remarked above, being as it is. Got me."}, {"userName": "Lori Budd", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7293983-lori-budd", "userReview": "This is a tough one. On one hand I honestly dislike Lincoln- the main character. I find him rather obnoxious and self centered. He is stuck in a job that he feels is beneath him. He loves the concept of being the editor, but being stuck in Chicago at a little publishing house is not where he belongs. Along the way of the story, life happens! His wife wants a divorce, there is a riot on the L train, and he pushes an elderly woman to the ground. He gets blackmailed by this woman's son (which at this point, I'm not even sure he is the son- but I may be looking too much into the story and hoping for some mystery) He is trying to get a sex book published by a girl that is in the office and even that, he acts so above it all- its annoying. HOWEVER- I started reading this book yesterday and am 50% done. I keep going back to it to read more. I am hoping that there is more to this story and somehow it all ties in. I have storylines in my head- and I don't know if that is where he is going, but at least my storylines tie it all together. We will see!REALLY? the fighting the bear story? Now I'm just baffled. and for him to think that ended his childhood? Maybe I don't see literary symbolism here, but that just makes no sense to me. Why does he rub his arm whenever he is stressed? And why would he rub Amy's arm? I see no corralation. I am done. Is it wrong that when he was on the plane, I was really hoping that the story was going to be that he finally got what he wanted all his life and then the plane crashed! Or that when he was trying to 'break in' to Amy's apartment, that someone would see him and call the police or shoot him?! I think this book could have had so much more. I don't like the ending. I think that someone who wants something his entire life and then changes it because of a situation will eventually go back to wanting the original thing. I believe in time, he will resent Amy and go back to being unhappy. And honestly, the whole bear story, just annoys me! This book had a path and on many occasions took the long way around to get from point A to point B - and the direct path would have been so much better! I am just glad that I got it free from Amazon!"}, {"userName": "Aaron Mcquiston", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5955599-aaron-mcquiston", "userReview": "\"Are You Happy Now?\" is a middle of the road book by a middle of the road author. I have never been one to scream \"midlist\" at something while I was reading it until now. It is not that it is horrible or has poor writing or is incredibly boring in any way. It is like the slew of really bad tattoos the people are getting. There are two things that can make a tattoo bad, it can be poorly executed or the idea for the tattoo can be a bad one from the start. If someone says, \"I want Peyton Manning riding a unicorn on my left shoulder blade,\" it's going to be a bad tattoo, even if Picasso is doing it. (Or Dali. I bet Dali would make a better football player/unicorn tattoo.) The point is that you can't polish a turd, and regardless of the execution, you can't made a bad idea into a good one. This is what \"Are You Happy Now?\" suffers from. The main character, John Lincoln, is somewhat of a bad guy. I like those narrators that you can't really stand, those real assholes that are only looking out for themselves, even at the expense of others. Those difficult people that you can't believe has the audacity to do what they are doing because honestly I know more of these people in real life than the do-gooder characters that you love. Lincoln is an opportunist at best, a user and abuser at worst. This makes it to where you root against him, hope that he fails, and that he ends up unhappy. Quite honestly there are a lot of people in real life that you feel the same way about.\"Are You Happy Now?\" is published by Amazon and that makes sense. I don't think that anyone else would really publish this and push it into the mass market like they did. And this isn't a bad thing. I'm sure they made their money at $3.99 a download, but it also is a testament to the quality of the novels that they push through their own labels: Not too bad but not something that you will cherish forever. Just something right in the middle."}, {"userName": "Tim Roast", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8073293-tim-roast", "userReview": "\"Alleys, thinks John Lincoln. At least Chicago has alleys.\" These are the opening lines, immediately catching you off-guard but in so doing drawing you in from the off.John Lincoln is comparing Chicago to New York, the place he sees as his future. \"He wants to attach himself to a great publishing house, edit profound writers, maybe even write a book or two himself. Bask in the pride of his parents. Wave those credentials in front of his rivals. Be somebody.\"The reality though is that he is stuck in Chicago, 33-years-old, on a marriage vacation from Mary and is just a small-time editor at a small publishing house, Pistakee Press, on the road to nowhere. That is until he meets Amy who on first impressions resembles a \"little ruffled grouse\", but provides John with his ticket out of here. Will he finally be happy?Overall I was reasonably happy with the book. Maybe the first-half with all of John's woe is me stuff got a little depressing in places, \"Am I going to die in exile in Chicago?\" he muses whilst he has the law on his back, his wife filing for divorce, plus a nagging feeling that his boss is soon to sack him. Woe is me indeed, but a book is about escapism so I didn't need that.The second half of the book picks up though as John has something to focus on, namely Amy and her book. But in \"blindly pursuing his ambition, he's corrupted an innocent.\" And so his idea of what would bring him happiness gets trodden on a little along the way, although by the end he realises once and for all what it is he needs to finally be happy giving a uplifting ending after all the doom and gloom before."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18944755-emily", "userReview": "[Amy gets pregnant and suddenly his entire life and all his woes are resolved?!

John Lincoln finds himself is Chicago, a city he hates, surrounded by Midwesterners he begrudge. As an executive editor for a niche publishing house, Lincoln is constantly on the lookout for the next big literary hit that will transplant him to New York, a hot bed for publishing greats. A commuter train riot, a blackmailing poet and an unassuming U of C graduate toss Lincoln into an existential crisis that will either sink his career or help get him to the Big Apple.After finishing Richard Babcock\u2019s Are You Happy Now?, I\u2019m very conflicted. Lincoln is an unlikable character for the majority of the book. He is disgruntled living in a city he hates with people he feels superior to. He puts his needs first and seems to have impulse control issues. He has no problem using others for his own gain. Although he suffers some pretty humbling experiences, both professionally and personally, I didn\u2019t see a significant change in his hubris. Babcock wants readers to see Lincoln as a changed man, but offers no evidence to support Lincoln\u2019s transformation outside of a quick epiphany late in the story.

If I'm being honest, that impression never really went away. My initial take on the protagonist was that he was average with a superiority complex, selfish and largely irritating. That impression never really went away either.A few pages in, I set out to not like this book. . . all the while I couldn't put it down. I was drawn in to the story against my will. I found myself relating to protagonist far too readily, especially unsettling given my general lack of real like or sympathy for him.I finished the book satisfied, having come to the conclusion we 30-somethings are all the same--not yet on the cusp of middle age but already ripe with disillusion; deathly afraid of ultimate disappointment, but having not quite let go of our youthful thread of hope. . . and that's this book in a nutshell (perhaps overly garnished with industry exposition, Chicago local color and literary references)."}, {"userName": "RYCJ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2877319-rycj", "userReview": "In a series of picking the book up and putting it down, it took me (at least) two weeks to read. The irony however, was I enjoyed the experience -- looked forward to getting back to the book even. The exchange between Buford, and of course Amy, were my favorites. I really liked the way Buford's character was written, to include the exchange between Lincoln and his boss about publishing Buford's tomb of poems. Oh, that was hilarious. Drawing out Amy's characterization however, would be the start of an entire new book... beginning with the subject matter of her manuscript, and the culminating series of events that emerged in the story.Other qualities of the story that engaged me was the tone. Loved that tone. Smooth, scenic, and hygienically mellow all around -- the type tone any reader who appreciates material not so over the top would enjoy as well. I like dry humor too, so the humor was another treat.
