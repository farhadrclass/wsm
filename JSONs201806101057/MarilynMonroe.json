Aside from some lovely shots of her in a summer dress and on the set of the Misfits, there are some details tacked on (she ate alot of cottage cheese) Eve captures the natural moments of solitude, personal grooming and joking around with her co-stars that was cool to see. The author notes that some of this lap-sitting and massaging should have been a cry for help-I disagree. I think Marilyn was a \"live life to the fullest\" kind of woman who liked to have fun and joke around. Why don't you check it out and decide?"}, {"userName": "Stefanie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8378130-stefanie", "userReview": "AMAZING. Eve Arnold is a favorite photojournalist of mine. I am always in awe when viewing her work and find myself always going back to it.

This hardcover is also emotional, and it definitely put Marilyn to her best :)"}, {"userName": "Amy He", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3253928-amy-he", "userReview": "Arnold respects and cherishes Marilyn without coddling or glorifying her, in a way that is genuine without coming across as an attempt to capitalize on the intimate relationship the two women cultivated. Highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Julie Ivens", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1207781-julie-ivens", "userReview": "Eve Arnold, who just passed away earlier this year, had a friendship with Marilyn over the years and many of the intimate cozy photos in here speak to their bond. Did I say that correctly? One of the best Marilyn Monroe photo books. The other is Milton's Marilyn by Milton H. Greene."}, {"userName": "Michael Mayer", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/356187-michael-mayer", "userReview": "I love this book but because of the time when most of these photos were taken (just before her death) it is a very sad book.

Also very sad because many were taken on the set of the Misfits towards the end of her life."}], "description": "In 1952 went on assignment to photograph Marilyn Monroe for Esquire magazine. According to Arnold's recollections, the now-legendary film actress was captivating and the photographs were a success. Their relationship, which started as one of mutual advantage, developed into a friendship and, over the course of ten years, Arnold and Marilyn met for six other photography sessions. The shortest session was two hours long and the longest spanned over a period of two months, while Monroe was shooting The Misfits. This book chronicles those photography sessions and includes a text by Arnold, which gives insight to Monroe's career and personality.", "title": "Marilyn Monroe", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182231.Marilyn_Monroe", "average": 4.27, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388450051l/182231.jpg", "reviews": 10, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/106322.Eve_Arnold", "name": "Eve Arnold"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Biography", "Art", "Culture"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182231.Marilyn_Monroe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1763627.Marilyn_Monroe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1516897.Film_Journal", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/298407.Eve_Arnold", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1907234.In_China", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3911377-in-america", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10713816-the-fifties"]}
