I don\u2019t know why this particular work drew my attention, but I\u2019m very glad that it did. When the book was published in 1937, Irmgard Keun was living in exile in the Netherlands, her previous novels having been banned by the Nazi regime. As the editorial note at the end of the Kindle edition explains, Keun returned to Germany when the Netherlands fell to Germany in 1940. She travelled on a passport in an assumed name, after the publication of reports that she had committed suicide. She then lived with her parents in Germany for the duration of the war.This is a short work and easy to read. However, its simplicity is deceptive and the final effect of the work is devastating. The novel is in the form of a first-person narrative and the story is slight. The narrator is Sanna, an unsophisticated and na\u00efve 19 year old in Frankfurt, who is not interested in politics and has the same concerns as other girls of the same age. Sanna is in love with the unprepossessing Franz and she wants to have fun. Her friend Gerti is in love with a Jewish boy (or rather, with the son of a Jewish man). Her sister-in-law fancies herself to be in love with anti-Nazi writer Heini. Her brother Algin, a novelist, contemplates whether he can conform and write in a manner which will not cause him political problems. Sanna\u2019s observations about life for ordinary Germans under the Nazi regime are a large part of what makes this work a treasure. Her observations are ironic and often laugh-out-loud funny, all the more so because Sanna is not consciously criticizing Nazism : rather, she relates its contradictions and perversity in a matter-of-fact manner which leaves the reader in no doubt as to Keun\u2019s views. As the novel progresses, the mood becomes darker and more desperate. Events start to spiral out of Sanna\u2019s control and her state of mind is reflected in the narrative. Juxtaposed to Sanna\u2019s first person narrative is her reporting of the comments of other characters, in particular those of Heini, who provides a much more direct criticism of Nazism than that of Sanna. This novel provides an amazing insight into life in 1930s Germany and in particular into the choices which had to be made by writers. It has left me wanting to read more of Keun\u2019s work. It has also left me wishing that I had not allowed five years of high school German language study go to waste. I have read that the most recent translation is very good, but of course I am in no position to know this from personal experience. I only wish I had not had to read the work in translation."}, {"userName": "Friederike Knabe", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1746401-friederike-knabe", "userReview": "Sometimes we happen to come across a little gem of a book that had disappeared, literally, for decades. After Midnight, written by Irmgard Keun in 1937 during her exile in Holland, is just one such book. Now translated into English by the admirable Anthea Bell, the first since the original translation in 1938, it belongs into a select treasure collection of recently re-discovered notable German fiction, written either just before or right after World War II. Each novel depicts, in its own way, aspects of ordinary people's daily life during the early years of the Nazi regime. Among these authors we find books by Hans Fallada (eg. Every Man Dies Alone), Hans Keilson (eg. The Death of the Adversary) and Irmgard Keun (eg. The Artificial Silk Girl). To this distinct collection of novels by 'contemporary witnesses' we can now add AFTER MIDNIGHT. In some way it can be regarded as a 'prequel' to Child of All Nations: A Novel, written in 1938, that tells the story of one family's life in exile, seen from the perspective of a ten-year old girl.Keun's three novels mentioned above open a window into a time and place that is difficult for us to imagine in detail. Her style is conversational and easy-going, with localisms and vivid images sprinkled in. In this novel, 19-year old Susanne, with an independent voice and a mind, roams with great ease between recounting what she hears and observes around her and pondering her own inner thoughts that either add humorous commentary on the people she meets, ask questions, or take her mind to past problems in her young life. Some readers might find Keun's writing a bit too casual and seemingly lightweight for the realities she deals with. However, there is much irony and depth in Susanne's comments and for us readers with hindsight, a wealth of astute observations.Susanne, 'Sanna', has recently arrived in the big city (Frankfurt) to escape the clutches of the Gestapo and to leave her mean-spirited aunt who had denounced her to the authorities together with her first love and now fianc\u00e9, the quiet, diffident Frank. With regret she had to leave him behind... but, as the novel opens, she has finally received a letter announcing that he is on his way to meet her \"one more time\"... Sanna's new life in the animated society circle of her step-brother Alvin, a popular and affluent writer, and his beautiful, luxurious wife, Liska, is exciting. Sanna, a pretty young woman, is enthusiastic, na\u00efve and trusting. She is not interested in politics and can just as easily flirt with a man from the SS, the SA or the Jewish doctor, who is one of her brother's friends. Sanna and her close friend Gertie, are often also joined by the funny, sarcastic journalist Heini who is highly entertaining despite, or because of, his falling out of favour with the authorities. He is the first to feel the wind of change and his ironic and witty commentary alone would make the book worth reading. \"I used to be a quick-witted and humorous journalist\", he laments. \"What I believed I had to say, I have said, in my own way and language. Now, in this time of widespread 'word inflation', is it not a pity when a thinking person moves on to total silence?\"*) Alvin, in the meantime, has also been included in the Nazi blacklist and can no longer find a publisher; his existence is quickly reduced to nothing and his mind to despair. As the story moves to its dramatic climax - \"after midnight\" - the pace in the narration speeds up, the different strands of the story come together, overlap and ...Keun's novel is first of all a fascinating document for its time. Yet, it is more also. It is an entertaining story to read that, with her typical light and ironic touch, provides us with a highly perceptive portrayal of a society on the cusp of disaster. Keun has filled her story with some memorable characters and their discussions on where the country is headed brings out different points of view, not all presented with the same level of seriousness as the Jewish doctor's consideration of possible exile, a move that does not appeal to Heini:\"... poor \u00e9migr\u00e9. [...] You will become a torment to yourself and a burden to others. The roofs that you see have not been built for you. The bread that you smell, is not being baked for you. And the language that you hear will not be spoken for you.\" *) all translations are mine."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16077597-matt", "userReview": "Past Midnight. Some stars still shine, behind cloudy mists. Let there be sun tomorrow, dear God. This book. Written in 1937, set around the same time \u2013 contemporary literature. And today? Is it still relevant? Unfortunately, yes. Who\u2019s going to read it? The sane people? They already know what\u2019s in it. The insane people? Reading is far too exhausting and boring for them. Any bet you they have not even read \u201cMein Kampf\u201d from beginning to end, and neither have I. Who should read it? Keun makes Susanne look clueless and na\u00efve. And then she tightens the screw more and more. The head threatens to burst. Too many characters. Aryans and Jews and those of \u201cmixed-blood\u201d are thrown together at the final party. German women should have children, but for this a process with feeling is necessary. And there must not be any mistakes that violate the law. Perhaps the safest thing is to not love at all. As long as that is allowed. Idiotic laws govern love. Laws not understood and not questioned. Questions will take you to jail. Some fantastic splinters from a keen observer. Keun knows the situation in Germany. She writes from exile. When writing a writer must not fear his own sentences, or God, or the world in general. A writer who is afraid is not a writer. But apart from that, you\u2019re superfluous. The dictatorship has made Germany a perfect country. A perfect country does not need writers. There is no literature in paradise. A strange little great book whose purpose I didn\u2019t totally get. I want to laugh with hatred. I\u2019m crazy, that\u2019s it. I will dance and laugh and sing to the madhouse.

Irmgaud Keun (1905-1982) was an author born in Berlin, whose work was destroyed in the infamous book burnings which took place under Nazi rule. Arrested by the Gestapo, she was forced shortly into exile, during which time she had an affair with Jewish author Joseph Roth. Much of this novella mirrors her life and you can feel the authenticity of experience in every line.Sanna flees from Cologne after being investigated by the Gestapo for making unguarded comments, and ends up living with her half-brother Algin and his wife. Once well-regarded and successful, Algin has found his work banned and is unsure about what he can write under the new political regime. For politics are everywhere and can no longer be ignored, even by those who previously had no interest in such things. Every word uttered, every opinion expressed, can be used against you. We learn of Algin's wife, Leski, who has fallen desperately in love with a journalist no longer able to work. Of Sanna's friend, Gerti, having a dangerous relationship with a man of mixed race. Of the charming and previously highly respected Jewish doctor, Dr Breslauer, shortly to be forced into exile. Events are centred around a much anticipated visit by Hitler to a local Opera House and a party that Leski is throwing, but an air of desperation and fear underpins the entire work. Much will change for Senna during this book, but the author cleverly mixes the absurd with the shocking, to show how the unbelievable can become mundane and the ridiculous accepted, as the world the characters once knew and lived in changes around them. This is a wonderful read and I am glad I discovered it. There is also an insightful introduction to the work, as well as an interesting essay on the author at the end of the book, which gives the reader a greater understanding of the novella."}, {"userName": "Susanna", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2095801-susanna", "userReview": "I was expecting After Midnight to be one of those novels that's not that interesting by itself but sticks in your mind later as a reflection of its times. I'm looking at Mephisto (Klaus Mann) and A Tomb for Boris Davidovich (Danilo Kis) here. Not so for Keun's novel of Nazi Germany, however. I enjoyed the novel while I was reading and still had that feeling of this-is-great-because-it-expresses-pivotal-history. Keun's narrator, Sanna, is deceptively na\u00efve. She's young and all absorbed with romance and social relationships and then, boom, she mentions some aspect of Nazi control that's recently come to dominate Keun's characters' lives. The growing effects of Nazism on everyday German society accelerate quickly throughout the novel, with Sanna's life being turned upside down within the course of the two days covered by the story. Like the aforementioned novels concerning authoritarian governments, After Midnight very clearly expresses the life-changing (and life-annihilating) properties of said governments. Unlike the other novels, the central character of After Midnight is one with whom readers can better identify because, at least on the surface, she's just like any other young adult. After Midnight also covers a fairly full spectrum of German lives, from intellectuals to children to Nazi sympathizers to the average people just caught up in it all. The novel even has a satirical character who, like Shakespeare's jesters and other jokesters, is there to provide some comedic relief along with a clear view of what, exactly, is going on. Only this is a book about Nazi Germany, so there's very little relief to be found in these scathing, depressed denouements that will only end in tragedy."}, {"userName": "Susann", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/959531-susann", "userReview": "One of the few instances when I just want to quote the book blurbs/review snippets, because all of them are spot-on. Keun wrote this slim novel, set in mid-1930s Germany, with a tone that is somehow light and devastating. Through protagonist Sanna's naive eyes and artless comments, the reader sees everyday Germany where Hitler's fascism has become normal. No one is safe; neighbors and relatives inform on each other and even a visit to the Ladies Room is fraught with tension about what someone might overhear.Sanna is an excellent observer and, although she is no Nazi-sympathizer, is also far from political and does not stick her neck out. Her naivete is not always believable and Keun does pack in the melodrama. But that is a small matter in such a strong showing of the horror of what is to come and what already is. Keun wrote After Midnight in 1937, shortly after fleeing Germany.Very glad I took a chance on this at the Brooklyn Book Festival and plan to explore more of The Neversink Library collection from Melville House Publishing. \"There was turmoil around the Opera House. People, and swastika flags, and garlands of fir, and SS men. The place was in confusion, all excited preparations, much like preparations for the handing out of Christmas presents in a prosperous family with quantities of children. You get used to feverish celebrations of something or other going on all the time in Germany, so that you often don't stop to ask what it is this time, why all the fuss and the garlands and the flags?\" [page 20]"}, {"userName": "Denis", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1729623-denis", "userReview": "Keun\u2019s life, who was opposed to the Nazi regime, could be the subject of a novel: at some point, she faked her own suicide to be able to live in Germany unbeknownst to the Nazis, who had put her on their black list (her books were burned). This short novel is, in a very quiet way, absolutely terrifying: by describing the daily life of a bunch of ordinary people in Frankfurt under the Nazis, she shows with an amazing eye for the details that matter how unbearable, debilitating, difficult, and suffocating, living under a dictatorship can be. Fear reigns, whatever you do, whomever you talk to, even when, like the heroine, you\u2019re a young woman who\u2019s not very political, a bit naive, and trying to find your place in society. What\u2019s even more chilling is how such a regime perversely destroy all that can be positive about a community \u2013 jealousies, betrayals, denunciations, hatred, become the rule, and a whole society slowly unravel. Nothing much happens in this book, which is also one of its strength: it\u2019s not a melodrama, nor a thriller. But the banality of evil creeps, finds its way, and permeates the lives of all the characters, turning After Midnight into one of the most effective, and devastating, account of the insanity that ruled over Nazi Germany.

Even firsthand accounts of life in places like Nazi Germany are limited because they can largely reflect only the perspective of the author. As a result, novels by contemporary German writers often seem to carry as much or more impact on understanding the times. Irmgard Keun's \nAfter Midnight\n is a notable part of that canon.Susanne \"Sanna\" Moder, the narrator of the slim novel, uses almost naive political impressions, the views of others and her memories in casting cast an indelible portrait of \"ordinary\" life at the time. In part a love story set in Frankfurt, Germany, in the 1930s, even Senna's simple, ingenue-like life is affected almost daily by Nazism and politics.Keun's book, written and first published in 1937 after she fled Germany, portrays Sanna as somewhat vacuous or at least generally ignorant of political details. To her, dresses, parties and love are the most important things in her life. When she hears speeches warning that those who impede the Nazi program will be smashed, her \"heart stands still ... because how do I know I'm not one of the sort who are going to be smashed?\" But she is clever. Despite admitting she admits she doesn't understand the nuances, she does know there are simply certain things you shouldn't talk about or do. Yet her observations, often unintentionally sardonic, help reveal life and society under Nazism. For example, when someone says Hitler united the whole German nation, Sanna thinks that's fine but \"it's just that the people making up the whole German nation don't get on with each other.\" Personal relationships certainly aren't exempt. Sanna and her girlfriend, Gerti, are interested in their love lives and the story's ultimate resolution revolves in large part around Sanna and the man she loves. But Gerti is in love with the son of a Jewish man and a non-Jewish woman. As a result, Sanna observes, he \"is a person of mixed race, first class or maybe third class -- I can never get the hang of these labels.\" Regardless of the label, Nazi race laws make the relationship illegal and the two risk their freedom by seeing each other.Likewise, when Sanna recalls being summoned to a Gestapo office, it appears a \"place of pilgrimage. Mothers are informing on their daughters-in-law, daughters on their fathers-in-law, brothers on their sisters, sisters on their brothers, friends on their friends, drinking companions on their drinking companions, neighbours on their neighbours.\" There is also a less consistent stream of people looking for those who have \"disappeared\" but they \"are not so well and kindly treated as the informers.\"Then there's Sanna's older stepbrother, Algin, a highly successful novelist -- until his books were banned by the Nazis. Facing the fact that he will remain \"undesirable\" unless he writes a Nazi novel and even then be viewed with suspicion, he contemplates writing a long poem about Hitler. Yet as a journalist friend observes, the Nazis have made Germany \"a perfect country, and a perfect country doesn't need writers.\" With its descriptive yet sparse prose, After Midnight reveals the pervasive effect politics had on normal life in Nazi Germany. Sanna's narration adds touches of innocence, satire and normalcy to a tale of people who, one way or another, have become outsiders in their own country. With the mix of people Sanna knows, her thoughts and their comments, the book provides a perspective on day to day life in pre-war Germany a work of nonfiction would find it difficult to capture.Algin's story seems to have a basis in Keun's own life. She wrote bestselling novels but once the Nazis took power the books were withdrawn from circulation. Keun, in fact, even dared to seek damages from the Gestapo for lost profits after it seized unsold copies of the novels. While she fled the country in 1936, she published several novels in Amsterdam, including After Midnight. She then returned to Germany in 1940 under an assumed name and lived there until the end of the war.After Midnight made its first U.S. appearance in 1938. This translation, by Althea Bell, was published in the U.K. in 1985 but is now the first release in Melville House's Neversink Library, a series of \"books from around the world that have been overlooked, underappreciated, looked askance at, or foolishly ignored.\" In addition to being an excellent work, After Midnight is a superb start to that series.(Originally posted at A Progressive on the Prairie.)"}, {"userName": "Pascale", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17430783-pascale", "userReview": "This is such an important book that I wonder how come I had never heard of it before. But then again, as Michael Hofman writes in his excellent and informative afterword to Keun's \"Child of All Nations\": \"I've no doubt that, had she been a man, her work would have been made available in valorous box sets and collected editions.\" First published in 1937, this is one of the strongest and cleverest indictments of Hitler and Nazism to see the light of print during that decade. The story is told from the point of view of Sanna, a publican's daughter, who has moved from the countryside to the city, and is currently living with her half-brother Algin, a promising writer, now blacklisted by the regime, and his wife Liska, a vapid beauty. In the first paragraph of the novel, Sanna receives a short letter from Franz announcing his imminent arrival in Frankfurt. Gradually, we learn that Franz, who is Sanna's cousin, is also her fianc\u00e9. Sanna is fully aware of Franz's goodness, but is vaguely ashamed of him because he cuts a poor figure in society. Sanna once lived in Cologne with Franz and his mother, Aunt Adelheid, but had to flee because her aunt tried to have her arrested by the police. Like many around her, Aunt Adelheid has joined the Party, in part because seeing the F\u00fchrer gesticulating and covered in sweat at rallies arouses her, and partly because only party members have the power to denounce friends, relatives or neighbors whom they wish to get rid of. Keun does a brilliant job of showing how many people have been quick to seize advantage of a system where in exchange for your allegiance, you can dispatch pretty much anyone you owe money to, or happen to envy or resent. Sanna feels increasingly like a fly caught in a cobweb, trying to help friends who are even less well-equipped than she is to survive in such dangerous times. The book is perfectly paced and its climax is a long party scene at Algin's apartment, at the end of which a once combative journalist commits suicide, in despair at the hypocrisy and cowardice he sees all around him. Simultaneously, Franz finally arrives in Frankfurt, and explains to Sanna why he has to either hide or flee. At this crossroads, Sanna realizes just how much Franz means to her, and decides to leave the country with him. But she is no heroine, and is terrified of what she is taking on. While trying to make a checklist of all they need to stand a chance of surviving, Sanna is constantly distracted by people pouring into Liska's party, which has turned into a crime scene since Heini shot himself. At some point, Sanna thinks: \"Perhaps they've already come to arrest Franz. Then I can stay here, it's not my fault, I did all I could, all I could.\" I just love this passage where Keun brilliantly shows how contradictory emotions always coexist in the human heart. Sanna is barely strong enough to do what extraordinary historical circumstances demand of her, and she'd be only too glad to be let off the hook, even if it meant losing the man she loves. This book is full of such marvelous psychological insights, and it deserves to be much more widely known than it is at present."}, {"userName": "Marcus", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10256931-marcus", "userReview": "I picked up this book on a whim, mostly because it is part of Melville House's Neversink Library series. It was one of the best literary impulse buys I have ever made.Far removed from the expected serious or somber tone of other literature dealing with life in Nazi Germany, the narrator Susanne recounts the events in the novel with the light-heartedness, simplicity, and flippancy of a teenage girl. This style makes for a fast and enjoyable read, and it is also the most striking aspect of the novel. As we read about the Nazis' increasing control over the lives of their subjects from the viewpoint of a carefree and apolitical young woman, we are allowed a glimpse into the chilling atmosphere of post-Weimar, pre-WWII Germany. More importantly, the narrator and the events of the story offer a tragic conclusion- at this time and place, even the most na\u00efve and apolitical could not escape the circumstances that forced politics and ideology into their lives. Despite the disquieting events surrounding the book's characters, Sanna (Susanne) and her social circle breathe a deep humanity and warmth into this novel that treats a grim period of history. Perhaps one of the most notable features of this book is the narrator's unintentionally keen observations on the absurdity and excesses of Nazi ideology, expressed with humor, irony, and bluntness. While the weight of outside events casts a shadow over the entire narrative, themes of love, friendship, and a youthful desire to merely live never cease to appear in the narrative. The characters are memorable, and the book successfully combines readability with insight and literary weight.After Midnight is a simultaneously entertaining and tragic novel. While valuable as a social text documenting Nazi Germany, this book is also a powerful and unique piece of literature.

My BA dissertation was about Irmgard Keun's The Artificial Silk Girl. I'm also familiar with Gilgi eine von uns., which was similar in style.

Her main character was once again a naive but observant young woman living in the big city, trying to make it big any way she can think of and reconcile with her idea of what's right and wrong. The book is in the first person, though and in her observations of the world around her, though, you see that things are going terribly wrong in Germany.

I certainly put the book down at the end with a sense of relief that I could now take a moment to breathe. I never really felt I fully engaged with the characters, but I wonder if that was intentional on the part of the author, given the detachment of the characters themselves as they look for ways to escape their various lives and situations.This is a quick read at only 135 pages, but I would not necessarily say it was a light one, despite the moments of great satirical humour that save the piece from becoming too depressive; more one for a dark, long night than a simple rainy afternoon, but worth the effort for those of you who like a deeper type of literary fiction.I received this as a free e-book ARC from NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42321-anne", "userReview": "I read an article about Irmgard Keun's life recently and decided to get ahold of all three of her major novels--this was the first one I read.

It's a really interesting perspective on the climate of Nazi Germany; so much of what I've read on that period has related to the Jewish perspective, or even the perspective of SS men or other Nazi soldiers. But to read about it from the viewpoint of a young German woman in no particular danger (by blood or profession, anyway) of being arrested and sent to a concentration camp was really cool.My only quibble with it is that my German is nowhere near good enough to read it in the original language, and I really don't like translated literature.

Recently re-released here in the US, it has a small but loyal following who do their best to get it more wide acclaim and for good reason. Part of the Neversink Library (which I\u2019ve mentioned in prior reviews) this is one of those books that you hold onto and keep for future generations to enjoy even though it may not be a best seller. With a simple storyline and even thinner plot, it is an easy read that somehow manages to invoke the spirit and essence of the time period with few extraneous details. While that may sound like a bad thing, it\u2019s not. Instead, it\u2019s the simplistic nature of this book that gives its beauty and timeless appeal.

Everyone has to keep an eye on everyone else. Everyone's got power over everyone else. Everyone can get everyone else locked up.\" Susanna (or Sanna as she is called) discovers this the hard way, as she is denounced by her own aunt for making unflattering comments about her aunt's adoration of Der Fuehrer (\"She liked the way he was sweating.\") Keun perfectly captures the growing fear and paranoia that builds as the Nazis suffocate normal life. Keun's books had been banned by the Nazis early on, and after having escaped the country, she faked her own suicide to sneak back in. She hid in Frankfurt for the duration of the war. After Midnight was written during her period of exile from Germany, and her sharp criticism of the regime stands as a writer's indictment of authoritarianism:\"The dictatorship has made Germany a perfect country, and a perfect country doesn't need writers. There's no literature in paradise. Can't have writers without imperfection around them, can't have poets. Once you've got perfection, poetry stops. Once criticism's no longer possible, you have to keep quiet. ... Perfection renders words unnecessary.\" This book is a short, sharp read, well worth the time, and well worth supporting the wonderful independent publisher, Melville House."}, {"userName": "Christine Frank", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/328474-christine-frank", "userReview": "I wanted to like this a lot more than I did. The author has been rediscovered but with our hindsight it may be even more painful to read, and the urge to stifle the heroine more fierce. In its simplest terms, take a flippant, silly, outspoken, boy-crazy young girl and place her in the full flower of the Weimar Republic. Hilarity ensues. Or not.Take Cher from \"Clueless\" and plop her down in the \"German\" (that is, non-GI) scenes of \"Inglorious Basterds.\" Now you have \"After Midnight.\""}], "description": "Sanna and her ravishing friend Gerti would rather speak of love than politics, but in 1930s Frankfurt, politics cannot be escaped -- even in the lady's bathroom. Crossing town one evening to meet up with Gerti's Jewish lover, a blockade cuts off the girls' path -- it is the F\u00fcrher in a motorcade procession, and the crowd goes mad striving to catch a glimpse of Hitler's raised \"empty hand.\" Then the parade is over, and in the long hours after midnight Sanna and Gerti will face betrayal, death, and the heartbreaking reality of being young in an era devoid of innocence or romance. In 1937, German author Irmgard Keun had only recently fled Nazi Germany with her lover Joseph Roth when she wrote this slim, exquisite, and devastating book. It captures the unbearable tension, contradictions, and hysteria of pre-war Germany like no other novel. Yet even as it exposes human folly, the book exudes a hopeful humanism. It is full of humor and light, even as it describes the first moments of a nightmare. After Midnight is a masterpiece that deserves to be read and remembered anew.", "title": "Despu\u00e9s de medianoche", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17976986-despu-s-de-medianoche", "average": 3.82, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1369519422l/17976986.jpg", "reviews": 75, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/176408.Irmgard_Keun", "name": "Irmgard Keun"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3290652.Carmen_Gauger", "name": "Carmen Gauger"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Historical", "European Literature", "Classics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17976986-despu-s-de-medianoche", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11654970-after-midnight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10412948-after-midnight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36203354-nach-mitternacht", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1147076.After_Midnight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13449627-nach-mitternacht", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/370756.Artificial_Silk_Girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1132529.Gilgi_eine_von_uns", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3367148-child-of-all-nations", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/360494.Das_M_dchen_mit_dem_die_Kinder_nicht_verkehren_durften", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/360496.Ferdinand_Der_Mann_Mit_Dem_Freundlichen_Herzen"]}
