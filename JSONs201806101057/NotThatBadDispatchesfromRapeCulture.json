Stunning writing. Pretty much everything I would expect from a collection put together by Roxane Gay.\nWhat is it like to live in a culture where it often seems like it is a question of when, not if, a woman will encounter some kind of sexual violence?\nThis is book about rape and rape culture. Some of the stories are empowering, some are depressing, but all talk about important aspects of the world we live in. Many of the writers explore how rape culture is not just about the act of rape itself, but also found in daily microaggressions, such as misogynistic jokes, \"friendly\" pats on the butt, and a guy suggesting a woman shouldn't take her pill in public because she is making a statement to men that they can do what they want to her without consequences. The essays often play around with style, writing in everything from lists to graphic novel format, which I liked. Many of the writers, I noticed, have a very similar writing style to Roxane Gay. So if, like me, you enjoyed the darkly gorgeous writing in Hunger and Difficult Women, then you should like it here in this book. Audrey Hirst's piece was a particular favourite of mine from this collection.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Emily (Books with Emily Fox)", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58160628-emily-books-with-emily-fox", "userReview": "We tell ourselves it\u2019s not that bad.

This is one of those cases. Roxane Gay has built an anthology so strong, both in subject matter and in style, that I am feeling inadequate talking about it. I will try though, so bear with me while I work through my feelings.It comes as no surprise that Roxane Gay is my hero. When this anthology arrived on my doorstep (I had preordered it months ago), I could not wait to start reading it. And I read it breathlessly, taking breaks in-between when the essays became too much, but adoring every minute of it.The essays are not grouped together but rather all stand on their own while building a crescendo of voices. Because they are not thematically grouped together they always met me unawares. Every single voice is needed, every single voice adds something to the conversation. I have not read an anthology that I found this strong, ever. The essays are all perfectly structured and wonderfully realized. There is not a single weak essay in here but there were some that spoke to me even more than the rest did.The anthology starts of beyond strong with Aubrey Hirsch\u2019s Fragments and Jill Christman\u2019s Slaughterhouse Island. Both essays different in tone and style but each beyond accomplished. My personal favourites of the book were Lyz Lenz\u2019 All the Angry Women and Samhita Mukhopadhyay\u2019s Knowing Better spoke to me in a way that I cannot just yet put into words; especially not in a forum that is by design public.Do you do that thing were you need to take a break from a book but clutch it to your heart because it is so important and brilliant?

This book - a collection of essays compiled by Roxane Gay - chronicles real life stories surrounding rape, sexual assault, rape culture, and ultimately how our society frames the experiences of many who suffer at the hands of these experiences as \"not that bad\" - pervasive cultural and societal minimization in experiences that are horrifying and inexcusable. This book left me in tears through different points in the read; it's raw, heartbreaking, sometimes depressing, but ultimately there's freedom from having these stories in the open to be discussed and digested. I had to take breaks in reading the audiobook because the pain and the experiences of them aren't too far from my own as a woman of color and from my own life experiences, but ultimately I'm glad I heard them. I honestly wish this book had existed sooner than this, wish that every single person could read this and understand how pervasive and prevalent these stories are, how many of them don't even get the chance to be told. I've heard snippets of some stories here before the compilation (such as Ally Sheedy and Gabrielle Union's pieces), but many of them were new to me and introduced me to a range of voices from different cultures, races, gender identities, sexual orientations, among other communities. Ultimately, it's a book I would return to for reference and recommendation to others - not just for the social commentary but also for the strength, honesty, and potency of each person's story.

While the bulk of the collection are personal essays, most of those are about writers who have survived rape.

It\u2019s sexual assault when women do it.

I felt anger, sadness and a lot more emotions throughout my reading process. For me it isn\u2019t a book to binge-read, it may be for others, but I had so many thoughts and feeling that I had to put it down after reading a few essays and just process everything I've just read.

This anthology became something different from what I originally intended.\" She writes that she received many submission with testimonial writing and after looking through these Gay decided to shift the concept to create a space for people to tell their story.People who have experienced sexualized violence themselves and/ or engage with critiques of rape culture regularly might ask why to read this book - we do know how bad it is. But Gay managed to put together a collection of impeccably written texts which though they are not (always) analysis in themselves create a bigger sum portraying the varied levels on how rape culture works/ is used and how different people are affected. This book is not interested in respectability politics, but instead engages in varied narratives (many written by people who are often not very visible in broader discussions on rape like trans and queer people, BPoC): AJ McKenna writes about being raped as a trans woman by another woman and how vocabulary and concepts seem lacking to describe her experience and how one tries to make excuses. Amy Jo Burns portrays what happens when you decline the role of the \"good girl\". Sharisse Tracey depicts heart-wrenchingly how she wrote letters to family members and other adults telling them her father raped her and asking for help - and how not one single person even tried to talk to her. Zo\u00eb Medeiros argues why she stopped telling her story. The essays in the book discuss specific vulnerabilities, the aftermath, the impact of people's re/in/action. There is one text in a more reportage style and while it tackles an important topic (sexual violence against refugee women) it feels odd in the collection and more or less just emphasizes the lack of the voices of these women themselves.In his essay Anthony Frame recollects how he sat with a girl outside, she alluding to her experiences with sexual violence and suddenly realizing that Anthony had made similar experiences himself: \"Holy fuck. You really do know what I mean, don't you?\" This book is about facilitating these kinds of encounters, of seeing your experiences reflected back and recognized, making it abundantly clear that there are no \"single, unrelated incidents\" but a system is in place, pointing at bystanders and enablers while also allowing victims to be complex, flawed people. One can only hope that also a few people who maintain that it is \"not that bad\", pick up the book and not only realize it is that bad but maybe even worse."}, {"userName": "Akanksha M", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44703049-akanksha-m", "userReview": "This book was so hard to get through. Not because it's badly written or badly edited, or because it's too lengthy, or because I did not like the writing style. It's because this book is so raw, so unerringly honest in how it points out all the ways in which rape culture permeates a woman's everyday life, that reading it made me feel like I was picking at my own open wounds.And I suppose, in a sense, I was. Living with misogyny and rape culture is not something anyone asked for, but we do anyway, and it stays with us. A giant, festering wound that prevents me from living the way I would like. A wound whose existence we all ignore, because the alternative is too difficult. Causes too much conflict. I don't know how to adequately express the way this book made me feel, much less do so in a less personal, clinically detached way. But I shall try. Not That Bad  features twenty nine essays, all written by people who fall on various spots on the gender/sexuality spectrums. This book is a harrowing look into the trauma of rape culture, each essay dealing with different facets of the same. So many lines I highlighted because they managed to encapsulate the seething anger inside me. So many bitter truths being spit from equally bitter mouths; and yet, these are truths we need to hear. Need to include in the conversation. Each voice is unique, but in the end, they all shout the same thing. We are all guilty of falling prey to the 'not that bad' mentality to simultaneously come to terms with, as well as invalidate the injustice meted out to us - that it's fine, at least I wasn't molested, at least I wasn't raped, at least I'm alive, it's not that bad not that bad not that bad  notthatbad!  But it is. If there is one central point to take home from this book, it's that yes, it  is  that bad. There is something terribly, terribly wrong with the world in which we live. And it has to change. For all the men and women who contributed to this book. For everyone like them. For all of us."}], "description": "Edited and with an introduction by Roxane Gay, the New York Times bestselling and deeply beloved author of Bad Feminist and Hunger, this anthology of first-person essays tackles rape, assault, and harassment head-on.In this valuable and revealing anthology, cultural critic and bestselling author Roxane Gay collects original and previously published pieces that address what it means to live in a world where women have to measure the harassment, violence, and aggression they face, and where they are \u201croutinely second-guessed, blown off, discredited, denigrated, besmirched, belittled, patronized, mocked, shamed, gaslit, insulted, bullied\u201d for speaking out. Contributions include essays from established and up-and-coming writers, performers, and critics, including actors Ally Sheedy and Gabrielle Union and writers Amy Jo Burns, Lyz Lenz, Claire Schwartz, and Bob Shacochis. Covering a wide range of topics and experiences, from an exploration of the rape epidemic embedded in the refugee crisis to first-person accounts of child molestation, this collection is often deeply personal and is always unflinchingly honest. Like Rebecca Solnit\u2019s Men Explain Things to Me, Not That Bad will resonate with every reader, saying \u201csomething in totality that we cannot say alone.\u201dSearing and heartbreakingly candid, this provocative collection both reflects the world we live in and offers a call to arms insisting that \u201cnot that bad\u201d must no longer be good enough.", "title": "Not That Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068524-not-that-bad", "average": 4.56, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1509771460l/35068524.jpg", "reviews": 172, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3360355.Roxane_Gay", "name": "Roxane Gay"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/345576.Ally_Sheedy", "name": "Ally Sheedy"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3338430.Gabrielle_Union", "name": "Gabrielle Union"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7780721.Amy_Jo_Burns", "name": "Amy Jo Burns"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17295917.Lyz_Lenz", "name": "Lyz Lenz"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2735908.Claire_Schwartz", "name": "Claire Schwartz"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/58842.Bob_Shacochis", "name": "Bob Shacochis"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14255324.Emma_Smith_Stevens", "name": "Emma Smith-Stevens"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Feminism", "Writing", "Anthologies"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068524-not-that-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35887136-not-that-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36381052-not-that-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35209531-not-that-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18813642-bad-feminist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22813605-hunger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18467818-an-untamed-state", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28818921-difficult-women", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32498369-black-panther", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205082-everything-is-horrible-and-wonderful", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
