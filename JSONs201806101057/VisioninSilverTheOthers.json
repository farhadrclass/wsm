Why? Maybe because I'm stingy with the stars? Maybe because I'm stoopid?!I'm breaking down and giving the stars. This is probably the best paranormal fiction I have read. I admit it.There are more storms coming. Big storms. Bad storms. We need to make this place work.That's the biggest question in this book. Can the \"Others\" keep living with the humans. After the humans act like dumbasses with the Humans First movement.\nThe world building in these books is big and I've gotten attached to several of the characters and every book I whine that I want more of that character. I do understand when books have this much going on that you can only give the reader so much. I think instead of 400 page books these should go on to be 800 page puppy squishers..and I would still eat them up.It's fun watching Meg's character grow. It's only been a few months since she escaped the controller and the Others are allowing her to grow into her own person. Sometimes I got aggravated with her and felt she was Mary Sue-ing but then the other characters jumped in a snapped her little whiny ass back into the character I love.Watching the human \"pack\" interact with the Others is tons of fun too.A pack of human females and some Crows in a building full of things to buy. He sat back and sighed. \"And humans think vampires are scary.\"The story still doesn't move along as fast as some books do but then it really didn't cause me to glaze my eyes over in boredom. Bishop kept my attention so much that I didn't even realize that I was at the end of the book. That rarely happens. I completely have steeped into this world and I love every single second of it. Must have this object too. Completely fangirling....\n Now I have to wait a year for the next installment?!!?!?! Unacceptable. WANTS MORE!\nI'm thinking this story instead of the whole sexy vampire/werewolf thing should have became the norm. Because it's awesome."}, {"userName": "Rabidreading", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6252434-rabidreading", "userReview": ""}, {"userName": "Maja (The Nocturnal Library)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4551536-maja-the-nocturnal-library", "userReview": "Three five-star ratings for three books in this series, that\u2019s pretty much all you need to know before running to the bookstore to get your own copies of all three available books. But if you need more convincing (as I usually do), I\u2019m more than happy to sing praise until I go hoarse. Or lose a finger typing. You get my point.Here it is in no uncertain terms: The Others, Anne Bishop\u2019s fantasy series, is brilliant, no two ways about it. Her worldbuilding is extraordinary, her characters fascinating, and even the tiniest details of her plots are thought through. So many things happen at once, but nothing is random and nothing is without significance for our Meg and the terra indigene. Bishop has many successful novels behind her and her experience is evident on every page, her control over her story absolute. Vision in Silver brings us back to the wonderful (albeit violent) world of Thaisia. Meg faces new challenges while adapting to her life in the Courtyard, and she needs to be strong enough to help not only herself, but the other blood prophets as well. Luckily for her and the rest of the cassandra sangue she has both determination and Simon\u2019s unwavering support. The human police are working more closely with the Others despite facing repercussions from the Humans First and Last movement. The HFL is becoming stronger by the day, constantly working to turn the public against the Others (not that they have to work very hard), spreading lies and bold misinterpretations of events, blaming the terra indigene for everything from hunger to bad weather. Being a so-called Wolf lover is becoming more and more difficult in Thaisia, and the humans working in the Courtyard are going through a very tough time.Simon, being the progressive leader he is, certainly won\u2019t allow the Courtyard humans to suffer for their allegiances. After all, his Meg needs her human pack, and everything Meg needs, Simon doesn\u2019t hesitate to provide. With her childlike view of the world, Meg is a very interesting character, but I found Simon even more fascinating this time around. He has the instincts of an animal and the astuteness of the most successful businessman, but he often fails to understand the human way of things. He tries, though, mostly because understanding humans means understanding and helping his Meg, but the process is slow and often hilarious. These two are slowly finding their way to each other. They are, for all intents and purposes, in a relationship, even if they don\u2019t seem to realize it. They practically live together and mostly act like an old married couple, but the way they show their affection is somewhat different from what we\u2019d expect.And that is precisely what I adore about the series. Bishop never lets us forget that Simon Wolfgard is wolf and only wolf. His kind has learned to live in human skin, at least temporarily, but they find it extremely uncomfortable and tend to avoid it if at all possible. Simon thinks like a wolf and acts like a wolf, and his understanding of humans is minimal. He sees the monkeys, as he calls us, mostly as prey, with only a few exceptions in the Courtyard itself. This series is basically about the clash of two cultures. Two species that have a history of horrible violence to each other are trying to find a way to live together in peace. Their differences are huge, but if there\u2019s enough common ground, thanks to Simon Wolfgard and Meg Corbyn, they might just succeed.Read this. That is all."}, {"userName": "Carol.

Really; utterly predictable, but clearly engineered to hit that magic trifecta of sugar, fat and salt. Read and could not put it down. I'm not even bothered by the filling I now need.*************Ok, feelz out of the way, I spent some time on a thoughtful review:Three hundred posts has given, at the very least, perspective on why a particular book may or may not appeal to me. As I wrote in my review of the surprisingly ghastly The Diviners (review), \"I tend to read for three things: plot, character and language. Usually at least one can sustain me through a book\" (You see, I'm citing myself so I don't turn into Jonah Lehrer [review]). Anne Bishop's The Others series is light on all three, and yet it is the Pringles in my reading world: I can't put them down. I should dislike this. The plot nominally revolves around a twenty-four year-old woman who is astonishingly naive. Normally, this would cause at least a small eye roll, but the context is that until six months ago, she\u2019s been confined against her will, her life structured and optimized to divine the future when her her skin is cut and blood drawn. Actually, her innocence to behavior subtleties becomes a clever narrative device, allowing her to seek explanations along with the reader. Many reviews rave on the world building, but I've found it glaringly incomplete--good heavens, it's odd. If Sanderson gave the impression of having created the world before writing a plot in The Way of Kings (review), Bishop seems to be discovering it in context of plotting. Inconsistencies appear, but because Bishop spends so little time on the details, I\u2019ve managed not to dwell on them either.Consider: The Others are a lifeform native to America (or whatever Bishop calls it, but since it has the Atlantik Ocean and five Great Lakes, let\u2019s go with America). Currently, many Others live in Courtyards in large human cities, similar to embassies. There are small human communities as well, particularly ones around farming settlements. However, The Others control all the land, leasing it to the humans, with wild spaces between communities for their more wild brethren. But humans mine, farm, log, ship, and presumably, work in the steel mills they mention. Trains run between communities. Ships sail the oceans. Snowmobiles and golf carts exist. There are also cars, electric lights, email, computers, videos, cellphones and telephones. Not mentioned is the corollary that there are rubber plantations, power plants, cobalt mines, movie studios, satellites and telephone lines. Questions: why does news take so long to travel? Why do The Others have to take trains with humans to get from community to community instead of emailing, calling or using their other form? Why does Bishop continually call attention to The Others rescinding leases for pollution without recognizing those industries are all \u2018dirty\u2019? There\u2019s enough cars to cause accidents. At the same time there\u2019s all these normal/current resources, why are The Others concerned with understanding the human community? Haven\u2019t they already understood it enough if they can drive, use computers, lease land, have Other-focused movies and Other-focused books?It\u2019s a mess, I tell you. I mostly accept it, and in this book, even grew to appreciate it as Simon, the leader of The Others in Lakeside, wonders if The Others taking human form are going to evolve into the replacement for the humans. I\u2019ve also assumed that Bishop was hinting at technological developments that would win the war against The Others, such as airplanes and mass-produced weapons. But guns are already in play in this society\u2013hunters are talked about in the first book, and this book points out that one of the fearsome Others needs to be in a certain range in order to harvest life, and being wounded by a gun is possible. So sure, it\u2019s clear humans can\u2019t win against earthquakes, tornadoes and snowstorms, but are The Others ready to lose the more corporeal-based lifeforms, and why are they so innocent about the risks humans present? And holy distractions\u2013are The Others really any different from humans if they enjoy hanging out in front of a movie with some popcorn??Lazy world-building aside, characterization is not particularly layered either. It\u2019s an ensemble cast and Bishop commits the crime of repetitive description, adding little information time they appear. Crows like \u201cshiny,\u201d Tess\u2019 hair turns color with her mood, wolves growl when they are irritated, spirits have the characteristics of their namesake (\u2018Winter,\u2019 \u2018Spring\u2019). Monty, one of the policemen, gets the most chance to develop when we meet his family. Meg, the blood prophet, shows a little character growth, although there\u2019s some not-so-slick reverse engineering allowing it (after 6 months outside her compound, she suddenly discovers too much sensory detail is \u2018overwhelming\u2019 and she\u2019ll \u2018shut down\u2019). Other than that, the narrative character-switching mostly gives the reader the sense that something is happening, when really, it is isn\u2019t. At least not in a large way. Personally, I have the feeling that Bishop was trying to get the reader to the point where such shifts in world-view would seem seismic. They didn\u2019t, of course, but they did seem significant.More significantly, there's a lot of chauvinism in this book. Males are leaders, enforcers, and spiritual gurus, whether Others (Simon, Eliot, Blair, Nathan, Henry) or humans (governor, mayor, cult leader, policeman). Women are the balancing act, the emotion, the social glue that keeps things running, soothes chaos and can be diverted by movies, yoga and jewelry. Most readers won't complain about the chauvinism because it is of the Noble Knight School of Sexism, where strong men protect the young/women, broker the deals, do the investigating, the fighting and the traveling. Men are predators. Yes, yes--this book has a scene that has an exception to this. One. I was thinking about this again because a normal real wolf pack always has females, particularly a very dominant one as co-leader, and there are no female wolves present in this situation. It's clear that there is a very gentle, growing relationship between Meg and Simon, so a lack of female balance keeps the social relationships focused on where Bishop wants it. But it is notable for me as another area that usually results in a serious amount of annoyance--particularly when done by Jim Butcher (reveiew).And the writing. I\u2019d give it tenth grade level, give or take. Simple structure, straight-forward punctuation and very few superlatives. The simplicity fits with Simon and Meg\u2019s voices, but the rest of the time? I suspect that because so much of it is dialogue-focused, it isn\u2019t as noticeable. Still, as I enjoy a vivid descriptor (note the \u2018beautiful language\u2019 tag on my page), so I find it interesting that this doesn\u2019t bore me: \u201cMeg didn\u2019t remember much about the storm that struck Lakeside after she\u2019d fallen through the ice on the creek. But she remembered being stuck in the hospital\u2026 because the whole city had been trapped by a record snowfall\u2026 Crows followed them as they continued down the road. Hawks soared overhead or found a convenient observation perch. A couple of Owls, who should have been home by now, flew over their heads.\u201dSo it\u2019s clear, right? I should be vehemently opposed to reading this, but I can\u2019t stop\u2013it\u2019s so delicious! After I finished this one, I started re-reading it the next day. And finished it again. Sure, there\u2019s problems, but nothing really has pushed me into full eye-roll. I also remain intrigued because it\u2019s the only UF I\u2019ve read so far that treats humans like inferior citizens and hints at an upcoming disaster. I can only conclude that Bishop has hit the taste trifecta of ideal composition of Sugar, Salt and Fat (review).Three and a half Other stars"}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "[ How do the vast majority of Others not know the basic things about how to buy goods and interact with humans?

I shit you not, folks,\u00a0The Others is still going strong, and no doubt it would continue to be so in the years to come. If I ever had one wish for the literary world, it would be this: that Anne Bishop would never, ever tire of writing about this complex, fantastic world, because when that day comes, I fear it would be the day my heart would wilt and die. I wish I were kidding, but I seriously love this series that damn much.I know I've said this again and again, but it demands to be repeated:\u00a0I loved\u00a0Written in Red and\u00a0Murder of Crows, the first and second books of this series. They were fun, beautiful, and riveting reads that made me turn pages like a lunatic, so engrossed in the stories, politics, and dynamics in the Lakeside Courtyard. It made me want to ditch my human skin and join these shapeshifting creatures, as they are definitely more fun than all these grouchy, greedy humans (if you read this, you will understand what I mean!). I expected\u00a0Vision in Silver to be as good, but it actually went beyond everything that I could ever hope for. I didn't think it was possible, but this third book might just be my favorite yet!The political intrigue that started in\u00a0Written in Red\u00a0concerning the issues between the humans and the terra indigene continues to grow here in book 3, the tension and violence ever-more increasing, especially with the appearance of Lizzy, the daughter of police officer Monty, who may\u00a0have jumpstarted a controversial string of events when she escaped a particularly difficult situation. It was so intense to see everything play out here - from how our friends at Howling Good Reads reacted, to how they took charge, even to how the humans attempted to manipulate them to take the upper hand! The plot points here were seriously so interesting to read as it effectively portrayed how far a specie\u00a0can go when they think it's for their own survival. Seeing everything go down to the ending was such a roller coaster ride that I still can't forget it up to this day. Needless to say, when it ended, my mind was still reeling from the impact of it.And it's not just that, the world here grows as well. There is a deep sense of mystery present as soon as the book hints at hidden terra indigene, too powerful and too old to even imagine and comprehend. They aren't really there\u00a0in a traditional, physical sense, but their presence and power and influence simply jump from the pages, making you feel mystified and, weirdly, humbled. It's so weird how that happened, but when I came to that point, I just really felt small simply from how even Simon was scared of them... whoever\u00a0\"them\" might be. This made me only excited to see what else is in store for us. I love how Bishop knows which kind of information to withhold, making us yearn for them... and when she discloses them, it hits us like a pick-up truck and our minds are left reeling, unable to compute the information given. She is\u00a0\nthat\n good.And the relationship! My SHIIIP! Simon and Meg continue to grow here as individuals and as friends (or maybe soon-to-be-lovers? YES, PLEASE!), taking their time as they discover more about each other and about themselves. How they affected other in many ways is even more pronounced here, and what is even better is that they are slowly becoming conscious of it, and my gods, IT IS DELICIOUS.\u00a0I just love their dynamics, the gestures here and there that are small but are so precious and meaningful. They come\u00a0from different backgrounds, from different species altogether, but the chemistry IS RIGHT OVER THERE and it's so interesting to see how their differences translate when it comes to\u00a0their interactions with each other and with other people (or creatures, mehehe).Long story short, this series and this book is perfection and don't believe anyone saying otherwise. :PVisions in Silver is a VERY strong continuation of a series that is known for its amazing,\u00a0likeable, and unique cast of characters and its world that is so vast, different, and eerily-familiar, all at the same time. If you haven't started this one yet (or the series in general), you're missing out and I implore you to get your copies now.------------------Post-reading:LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVEIt is one of my fervent wishes to live in Lakeside Courtyard. It amazes me everyday how Anne Bishop is able to create a world so brutal and so charming at the same time. To be honest, I love this installment the most.

I kept thinking \u201cnooooo\u201d as I saw the percentage on my Kindle climbing to 100. I have to say this is my favorite fantasy series out there to date. This installment was very much about Monty and his daughter Lizzy, and the changing relationship between terra indigene and humans. As we know from the previous books, Elayne, Monty\u2019s former lover, had taken up with Nicolas Scratch, prominent spokesperson of Humans First and Last and this becomes very important to the events that play out in Vision in Silver. HFL\u2019s movement stirs up much hate towards the terra indigene and forms a divisive line between the humans who are friendly towards terra indigene and those who are not. The lines between humans and terra indigene in the Lakeside Courtyard, on the other hand, have become blurred. Now instead of thinking of them as just \u201cclever meat\u201d, they\u2019re viewed as members of their human pack, or Meg\u2019s human pack, affording them consideration and protection. These changes in attitude are thanks to Meg, she\u2019s the catalyst, \u201cThe Trailblazer\u201d in a new friendship forming between the two kinds. Living outside of an institutionalized situation is also becoming an issue with the rescued Cassandra Sangue girls, as well as Meg. The outside world can easily overwhelm these girls to a dangerous level. But because Meg is a little more self-aware and been on the outside longer, she\u2019s able to recognize triggers that set these girls on edge. There are so many aspects to this series I love to think about, like the \u201cverbal hierarchy\u201d The Others used to indicate the degree of interaction with an individual: they\u2019d use the Lizzy to indicate more of an outsider, or worse that Lizzy to indicate a human they didn\u2019t like. As soon as humans became closer they became just Lizzy or in the case of Meg where there\u2019s special affection and possession assigned, our Meg. The interactions between the humans and terra indigene in the Lakeside Courtyard continue to be fascinating and hilarious at times. Of course the development of the romance between Simon and Meg continues to be my favorite part of the story. Simon and Meg are very new to the dynamics of a romantic relationship (not that they actually know they\u2019re in one) and so some of their feelings take a while click. It\u2019s very entertaining to witness the light coming on. Things are coming to a head with the humans and the terra indigene, especially in regards to the powerful, more dangerous, wild forms of terra indigene. They are for the moment quietly sitting back and watching all the interactions, but could very quickly step in and wipe out all the humans if they become more of a threat. It\u2019s hard to properly express how special and unique this series is. All I can say is if you haven\u2019t picked it up, you are definitely missing out!

I picked-up WRITTEN IN RED on a whim in 2013, and was wowed beyond measure. My fixation with all things THE OTHERS is so profound that it should be a bona fide medical condition. No joke! I listened to the previous two installments, so I did have some concerns that switching to hard copy might diminish my enjoyment of VISION IN SILVER, but that clearly didn\u2019t happen because for the third time in a row 5-stars just isn\u2019t enough. In this book we learn a lot more about the cassandra sangue, gain perspective on Simon Wolfgard, and get a glimpse of the terra indigene that live beyond the courtyards.The blood prophets were the main plot focal point; free of their keepers, these girls are ill-equipped for life outside the compounds, and now it\u2019s up to Meg to set them on the correct path. She and the other members of her human pack are attempting to write a sweet blood 101 guide of sorts. Little is known about the cassandra sangue, so a lot of it came down to trial & error with Corbyn as the lab rat. I liked how the author approached this aspect of the story, the progression was gradual, and each new discovery felt as though it could be the key to their very survival. Meg\u2019s triumphs became mine, and her setbacks were absolutely devastating. Most were small things, but when experienced from such an innocent POV as this series\u2019 protagonist, they became monumental.Most stories that feature shifters put emphasis on the humanness of the characters while as Bishop does the total opposite. Her various gards don people flesh out of necessity, but it\u2019s evident that they prefer fur, and view mankind as \u2018clever meat.\u2019 This is part of what makes THE OTHERS universe so original because misunderstandings between the two species occur frequently from common expressions being taken literally to every day gestures being grossly misinterpreted. I enjoyed gaining perspective on how the terra indigene see the world through Simon because he\u2019s the most progressive leader among them which makes his outlook fabulously unique. He\u2019s tasked with a huge decision at the end of this novel, and the outcome could be\u2026 scary.This leads me to this book\u2019s second main plot thread. Tension between THE OTHERS and humans has reached a boiling point, the Humans First and Last movement is gaining momentum and people are being forced to choose a side. You\u2019re either a Wolf lover or a delusional HFL supporter who believes that mankind actually has a chance at being the dominant species. Bishop has succeeded in making me hate my own kind by illustrating the barbaric nature of Thaisia\u2019s citizens, and highlighting the underlying prejudice that exists in all societies. The author makes it impossible not to cheer for the terra indigene, and eagerly anticipate the fast approaching day of reckoning when the wild country finally shows its teeth, and establishes once and for all who\u2019s predator and who\u2019s prey.There\u2019s only one cure for a VISION IN SILVER book hangover, and it\u2019s more Meg & Simon!"}, {"userName": "Jilly", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894509-jilly", "userReview": "Now that I am finished with this book, I have to wait an entire year for the next one. And, I just can't do that. Nope. Not good at waiting. At all.I love this series so much! There is no end to the amazing characters who are so well written that they steal my heart. I just want Anne Bishop locked in a room, writing, forever, so that I can keep reading her books. Is that too much to ask?So, in this book, we are really continuing on with the story that has been shaping up for a while. There is a hate-group out there called \"Humans First and Last\" that is trying to drum up trouble for the Others. They have an evil spokesman and everything. Like most hate groups, they have more hot air than sense. You know, considering that the Others can just decide to kill all of the humans in just a day and be done with it. But, nooo, they are going to keep poking the bear. Literally.Simon, the wolf, is trying to keep Meg happy by keeping her \"Human pack\" safe when the hate-group starts targeting all \"wolf-lovers\". It's getting ugly in the human world so keeping some of them safe is getting difficult.In the meantime, Monty, the cop, finally gets his daughter to come and live with him. But, along with her comes a whole lot of trouble because her mother was with the evil spokesman for the hate-group, and they killed her. Now, they are targeting the little girl because she may have some evidence of what happened.All of this makes Simon consider ways to keep the wolf-lover humans safe by having them live among the Others. Since this has never been done, it makes for a lot of adjustments. Especially since the Others have so little understanding of humans. Of course, I love that part of the book the most because the misunderstandings are funny.When Simon called some kids \"pups\":\nSarah giggled. Robert said, \"We're not pups; we're kids.\"He eyed Robert and Sarah with more interest. \"Little humans can shift into young goats?\"\nWhen Vlad, the vampire, wanted some human women to leave his office:\nHe picked up a pen and moved a couple of papers on the desk. He'd seen a human in a movie do that as a way to end a meeting. Apparently, the females hadn't seen the movie.\nI also loved the way all of the Others acted like the teddy bear was alive, or had feelings. It was so freaking cute and funny.When Lizzy was talking to the police and said that Boo Bear might have been to blame for the bad-guys following her:\nNathan considered this information...It sounded like human young didn't know enough to stay quiet and hidden when a predator came sniffing around the den. Didn't seem fair to blame Boo Bear, though, since he wouldn't have blabbed to anyone.\nSo many times, when I was reading the different wolves thoughts while they were trying to understand the humans, I thought of my dogs when they do that cute head-tilt thing. You know, when they act like they are trying to understand you?Aww, that's so cute. Let's give him something!But, most of all, I love the relationship between Meg and Simon. Since Meg doesn't know how to human any better than Simon does, it is super adorable watching them grow into a romance of sorts. There has been no actual romance in the books at all, but it seems like it may be heading that way. Very very slowly. I am dying for Simon and Meg to get together.

This isn't a book about Meg. This was Monty's and Lizz's book. I saw very little of Meg and I am so upset and disappointed. I mean, Monty and his daughter aren't even Others.First 50% was good-ish. . \u201cShe\u2019s learning from us; we\u2019re learning from her. And she and I . . . We\u2019re learning together.\u201dBUT there were some things that I just can't get. Meg and Simon being friends or something they don't understand. Ok, I can't expect Meg to know what Romance or Love is(because she's been confined for all her life and I suspect she doesn't even know those feelings and I guess there's a long way for her and Simon, if they are ever going to try anything) , but Simon? He has lived more, he has experience, he knows stuff, so  HOW CAN HE CALL MEG A FRIEND??? It annoys me so much!! Yes, the Others are definitely more stupid than the humans. And not only in this case. In many others. Only the Sanguinati seem slightly intelligent.I can't believe this book was part of this series. It has nothing of the previous' books glory.The second half had me like:I wanted desperately to finish it. It was becoming too boring. I didn't even care for some of things that were happening. Argghh! Only in the end the things became a bit interesting, but it wasn't enough to get another star in my 3 star rating.I will continue the series, because I loved the first 2 books and I know Anne Bishop can write wonderful things.

The book started off promising with the conflict between the humans and terra indigene but this plot overpowered everything else in the book. There was little to no character growth between Meg and the inhabitants of the courtyard. This was particularly annoying in relation to Meg and Simon. Everyone, including readers and the characters in the book, know where this relationship is going and yet nothing has happened to further my interest in this relationship. The most growth that happened between these two happened in the first book. I would have been okay with this if the plot was intriguing but I found myself constantly skipping through pages since I was bored. This book did not ignite the need in me to immediately know what happens next like the first book did and I'm unsure if I will continue on with this series. *ARC provided by NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Robin (Bridge Four)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14105531-robin-bridge-four", "userReview": "I want to preface this by saying I totally enjoy this series. I like Meg. I like Simon. I\u2019m keep hoping that somehow they will hook up and soon but it is really slow on that front\u2026.like snail pace slow. Still even though the romance I long for is waiting to catch fire that didn\u2019t diminish my enjoyment of this book.There are a few issues though that I saw in this. It sometimes gets a bit repetitive. Good if you are going a year between books and need a refresher, everything from prior books is brought up and distilled down. But if you are reading these back to back then I think it might be an issue.The other issue I had was actually with Meg\u2019s character. In the last two books she is fragile and strong all at the same time. Her fragility has more to do with the world around her and being really sensitive to her surroundings. But now she is having panic attack like symptoms. Yes this plays into the overall plot with the other blood prophets who aren\u2019t in captivity anymore but it was a little bit of a stretch. That said though I liked that with her human girl pack they are working to discover some of the mysteries of the blood prophets to share with others.\n\u201cWhat do you expect us to do?\u201d Meg shouted. \u201cWrite The Dimwit\u2019s Guide to Blood Prophets?\u201d \u201cYes! That\u2019s exactly what I want you to do.\u201d Looking at their stunned expressions, he wondered if he\u2019d been a little too honest. \u201cFigure it out and write it up so we can pass on the information to everyone who is trying to help these girls.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a writer,\u201d Merri Lee protested. \u201cI can make notes, sure, but I can\u2019t write up something like that!\u201d \u201cRuthie will help you write it.\u201d There. Problem solved. Ruthie was a teacher. She wrote sentences all the time.\nBut the story is still good and I like the addition of both Jean and Hope in their communities. This is one of those books that makes me hate humans. Yes not all are bad but it does speak to what happens when one group thinks they are more important than all the others and decide to get mean about it.\n Didn\u2019t humans realize the terra indigene had heard such words before? Didn\u2019t humans understand that such words were a warning that a fight for territory was building under the surface? Didn\u2019t they wonder what had happened to cities, and civilizations, the previous times humans had made such claims?\nI still love seeing the world through the Others eyes and finding how different they think from us. I mean just buying a building can be a little bit hilarious.\n Why couldn\u2019t they just give the human female a bag of money and then pee on the building so that everyone would know it was theirs?\nThe violence between the factions is escalating and soon there will be no going back for sure. Especially the lengths the Humans First and Last movement is getting. I\u2019m both excited and terrified to see what lives in the deep wild and is a protector of the land. There are a few heartbreaking moments and more development on the Cel Remano story arc and just what Nicolas Scratch is planning. Plus finally we get to meet Lizzy and he furry bear companion. I think it was adorable to see some human children enter the Pack\u2019s life. There in for some surprises.Overall I\u2019m still very much enjoying the different take on shifters and this UF world. I do wish we could speed up the Simon/Meg romance but other than that I\u2019m just going to enjoy the rollout of the rest of the story."}, {"userName": "Choko", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27962805-choko", "userReview": "*** 4.44 ***A buddy read with my family at the Wednesday BB&B Urban Fantasy Group! This series continues to get better and better. The overall arc of humans trying to live in harmony with the original inhabitants of the planet, The Others, and failing miserably, has taken a very interesting route under the treatment of the author, Anne Bishop. I have heard many times that you either like her writing or you hate it, and once again I am finding out that I am on \"I Love It\" side of the argument. Is there a particular reason for that? No, not really. There is something about her storytelling though, that speaks to my love for small details, which enrich the big picture, even when those small details seem silly or superfluous... For me they add this charm and whimsical feeling to a story, which at times might seems as if it is stalling, but instead it just builds on the emotional connection of the reader with the world and characters. \n\"...\u201cFor now, he and Meg were going to have the adventure of seeing a new place and having a new experience. Together.He wasn't human. Would never be human. And Meg didn't expect him to be. But feeling her hand in his, Simon thought maybe he could learn to be human enough.\u201d ...\"\nOnce again, the romance that all of us saw coming from the first chapter of the first book, between the very wolfy-wolf Simon and the very sheltered and innocent Blood-Prophet Meg, did not reach even to a kiss, although I think they are considering some hand-holding:) And this is perfectly fine with me:) I love the way the two of them, just as the two cultural groups they represent, are finding out more about each-other, discovering things necessary for their shared safety, but also things that just make you smile... And as raw and animalistic as the Others are, and as much as they have looked upon humans as \"Smart Meat\", there are breakthroughs happening in the human-Others relationships, mostly because of the budding romance between Simon and Meg, and also all species of Others in the Lakeside Courtyard and Meg, whose visions have kept them safe more than once already. It just sucks for all of them that this is the time the \"Humans First and Last\" or HFL movement has decided to incite violence between the two groups in order to make money off of Humanity's suffering and blame it on the Others, thus starting a civil war... Humans blame The Others for everything that befalls them, attack and when there are consequences, they blame The Others once again, unwilling to admit or even see that they are the true culprits... No wonder some of the Big-Bad Others, who don't even come in contact with the humans, are fed up and thinking about Exterminating the species from the continent... And I have to agree, the Humans kind of deserve it... As bad as it is on the Big Scale of things, the Courtyard residents are falling in love with their Meg, who is trying to figure out ways to help the newly freed Blood-Prophet girls in order to stay alive... Freedom seams to be very difficult for them, since a strict sensory input control has to be imposed, but most who have taken the girls in with the desire to help are fully unqualified to do so, not having any idea of how to even approach what the real issues are... Meg feels safe in her own circle of friends and those whom she consideres family now - Simon and Sam, as well as the newly forming Human Pack. Favorite part of the whole book was when the mother of two human children told him that they are not called pups, but kids...\n\"...\"...Sarah giggled. Robert said, \u201cWe\u2019re not pups; we\u2019re kids.\u201dSimon looked at Robert and Sarah, then at Ruthie.Kids. He\u2019d heard Merri Lee say something about when she was a kid. But the word didn\u2019t apply to her now because she was an adult, so it had never occurred to him that, maybe, humans had a little shifter ability that they outgrew as they matured. When she had said kid, maybe she had meant kid?He eyed Robert and Sarah with more interest. \u201cLittle humans can shift into young goats?\u201d Kids were tasty. Would human-turned-goat taste different from goat-goat?\u201d ...\"\nHahahaha!!!! I guess we do change forms from when we are kids to adults:) Magic!!! Still, my favorite characters were scary Tess and the developmentally disabled pup, Skippy! I want them to adopt me into their pack!!!Now I wish you all Happy Reading and many more wonderful books to come!!!"}, {"userName": "Sanaa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5944522-sanaa", "userReview": "[5 Stars] So freaking good I can't even, AND THAT LAST SCENE.

Also, the way the wolves think and act are so NOT human that I'm really starting to wonder if the author ... moonlights.This is urban fantasy and not paranormal romance so don't go in thinking there's going to be any romance of the sort. But. There's something I tend to like more, even though it's taking a very, very, VERY long time to develop.

She wasn\u2019t terra indigene. Despite that, Meg was becoming one of them.\n There are no words to convey how much I LOVE this series!!! \nSPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE PREVIOUS BOOKS.\n When the Others saved the cassandra sangue from their jailers, they never expected the danger that would follow. No one knows how to protect these fragile seers, especially when all of them seems unable to handle their new surroundings. And the only one who can provide the answers to saving them is Meg Corbyn. Simon Wolfgard hates asking Meg for help in saving the blood prophets, knowing she would have to face risks in order to do so, but he has no choice, she\u2019s their only hope.  When blood prophets start to only predict devastation and death, it seems to be a warning of things to come. The HFL, humans first and last, movement is becoming stronger, gaining more human followers and posing a big threat to the Others and to those who interact with them. They don\u2019t care to what lengths they need to go to spread their prejudice, the betrayals they need to commit to win their fight.  Meg is still a wonderful complex character. She\u2019s still struggling with her addiction to cutting and it makes her friends very worried about her. But even though she knows that her kind can only survive a thousand cuts, her fear about missing some valuable clues that could save her friends, makes it hard for her to resist. I couldn\u2019t blame Meg for needing to know about the dangers they would face, but seeing how addicted she was to cutting made panic. Is she ever going to be able to grow old??? The only thing that bothered me a bit about her in this book was her sudden inability to cope with her surroundings, with any changes. I guess it was necessary so that she could help the other blood prophets navigate their issues with adapting, but the sudden change did confuse me a bit.  The plot continues to escalate with the HFL making things worse for the Others and their friends and acquaintances, and it definitely seems that a war is coming. And I for one can\u2019t wait to see these monstrous HFLs get eaten.  As always I loved spending time with all the characters and I\u2019ve come to love all of them. I love how attached the Others has become to Meg and her human pack, especially since there has never been any kind of bond like this before between the two different species in this world. I also really like that we\u2019re getting to know more of the other blood prophets, and seeing what they are capable of.  \n\nHe wasn\u2019t human. Would never be human. And Meg didn\u2019t expect him to be. But feeling her hand in his, Simon thought maybe he could learn to be human enough.\n\n The very slow romance between Meg and Simon keeps making my heart melt. I love how much their friendship means to them, and how possessive Simon is becoming of Meg. They are definitely one of my favorite couples ever, and they\u2019re not even a couple yet!! :-D  I adore this series and I just want to inhale every page!! Anne Bishop has created a unique and fascinating world, with amazing characters and plot.

It gives you tons of information and builds a world and situations that are bond to happen. You know it. The thing is: sometimes, you don't understand why what you are reading is so important. But it is. And it will come back later and you'll be 'ahhh now it makes sense.'\"She wasn't a wolf. She wasn't a terra indigene. Despite that, Meg was becoming one of them.\" While Meg, the blood prophet who has to cut herself in order to have visions of the future, isn't as present in the first half as I'd have liked to, she is there in the second one and she grew so much! In this book, Meg realized that for the first time in her life the terra indigene are her friends and love her for who she is, not because she can save them through her visions. In fact, they don't want her to cut because they want her to live with them as long as possible. And Simon, Meg's best friend (and hopefully lover in the future *crossed fingers*), cares for her so deeply that their scenes are always what I look forward the most. \"Feeling her hand in his, Simon thought maybe he could learn to be human enough.\"Simon, the great leader and a wolf, is very present in this book and I was so happy! While in the first book I thought he was very narrow-minded and got angry too fast, he grew on me in a way I've never seen before. In the last book and in this book, I was always very anxious to hear his sides of the story and was very happy when it was his POV. He always had thoughts of Meg that weren't hard to hear. (Who am I kidding? I live for Meg and Simon.) He has to deal with a lot in this book because he and the others/terra indigenes (wolfs, vampires, bears, Elementals, crows, you name it) have to face humans and all the wrong accusations they make of the Terra Indigene every day. This book is practically all focused on the relationship between our paranormal group and humans. I have no shame in saying that I will always root for the others - in this book, I was ashamed of our race but proud of Montgomery, Meg, even Merry Lee. (Humans who think in this series.) -It feels different, this scar. - It's a sign of a caring heart. It should feel different. - We take care of each other, don't we? - Yes, we do. (The relationship between Meg and the others <3) This book made me nervous. It made me read it so fast I only realized I had reached the middle of it because my brother said I wasn't even blinking and when I did, I saw the page I was in. I waited so long for this book and I'm almost kicking myself for reading it so fast. Everyone grew, and I was a very proud mom. These books are not for everyone, in fact, they are not my typical kind of book, either. But once I fell in love with the environment, the characters, the mystery, the situations they have faced and will have to face yet in the future, I couldn't be happier for giving this series a shot. It is funny? Yes, because the others often wonder about human things and I always find myself giggling. The romance? You will never root so much for characters that are soooo slow. It has mind blowing situations and this book even had a bit of politics, something I always thought as boring but that in this book made me feel as if I was in the middle of a chess game or in a game of 'war'. Seriously, I can talk all day long about this series and never be bored. Blood prophets are shown on this one, corrupt governments, the 'wild side', and our lovely characters are as present as ever. Tess, I love you. You're bad-ass. Vlad, you're the sexiest vampire. Henry, I want to hug you and never let you go. Simon, *sigh*. Jenny, I felt your pain! And Nathan, come be my wolf guard, would you? All Bella (my Yorkshire) does is sleep. What to do now? Die waiting for the next one (and it has to have another one, otherwise I'll die for sure.)

I liked this one but compared to the first two books it was a bit of a letdown. In this book, the story is told from the viewpoints of several characters. While in the first two books we read from mainly Meg\u2019s perspective. I adored her voice. Unfortunately we don\u2019t get nearly as much from Meg in this one. I\u2019ve never been a fan of reading books that are told from a large cast of characters, as this one was. The perspective is so much broader and less focused on personal development. Because of that, I really didn\u2019t connect with some of the characters, particularly Burke and Monty. Additionally, the different storylines need to be equally interesting. Otherwise, I find myself wanting to rush through the less interesting parts and back to the interesting ones, as I did with this novel. Another thing that bothered me is that it got bogged down, at times, with too much information. Honestly, parts of the story were downright boring. There just wasn\u2019t a lot of progress. There was a lot of buildup and then it just tapers off to a conclusion that was rather sedate. It almost felt like running in place. That\u2019s not to say that Vision in Silver didn\u2019t have some good parts, it did. Tensions are rising with the HFL, Humans First and Last, movement, as they step up their plot to turn humans against The Others. Little do they realize how incredibly stupid their aggressive and prejudice actions against The Others is. And those actions aren\u2019t without serious consequence. In Vision in Silver, Simon takes steps to further integrate with humans. I enjoyed getting a deeper insight into his character and his view of things. We see the strong bond between him and Meg. She is his friend, one of the most important people in his life. Because of her, he has completely changed how he views humans. She is the reason for all the changes in the Courtyard. Their dynamic is interesting and entertaining. Actually, the whole Courtyard dynamic is fascinating and I like seeing how the characters cope with the changes taking place and learning more about them. I also enjoyed reading about one of the girls that was rescued in the last book and seeing her progress.In conclusion, Vision in Silver is a good book. I just didn\u2019t find it to be a compelling or fascinating read. I liked it but I was expecting more. I can only hope the next one is better.To see more of my reviews go to Paranormal Kiss.*ARC (Advanced Review Copy) received from the publisher, PENGUIN GROUP/Roc, via NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11855472-steven", "userReview": "This series is quickly becoming one of my top favorites. Such an interesting world. I'm totally caught up in the lives and challenges of these two groups of people struggling to make things work in a world that is headed towards a war. The Others and their \"human pack\" are such an intriguing story to read. I love the growth we've seen in the Others as they come to care for some humans, and the increase in number of humans on the \"right side of history.\" This book was darker than the previous two. We lost a few good characters in it and it seriously broke my heart. I see Hope in the darkness.

There is nothing like it out there and it's the idea Bishop is pitching successfully to readers third year in a row.:)**************************With second book we finally took a step out of Courtyard to see a bigger picture of Namid's world. That added new layers to story since we became aware that there are more parties inhabiting these territories (Intuitus) and that arrangement between Others and humans is not really working. It's a ticking bomb waiting to blow up, as we saw it happened in Thasia, in Jerzy area.This book deals with effects of Meg's staying in Courtyard and her influence on Others and how it changed the dynamics between humans and terra indigene in times when tensions and incidents all around the world are becoming more frequent and more violent. As we know, Meg gained trust and protection of Others by preventing several bad incidents with her premonitions. She became a pack and their friend. She opened Simon Wolfguard's eyes to the fact that not all humans are thinking bad and only worth to be considered food, which resulted in cooperation with human police (Burke and Montgomery) and allowing other humans access to parts of Courtyard and parts of their lives that were strictly forbidden to them. Events of MoC, when humans made their first serious move against terra indigene creating two powerful drugs, left Others wary and distrustful more than ever. And not just that- older, native terra indigene who live in wild lands are keeping close eye on humans after what they did, so Simon and rest of BA know that with new conflict HFL is gunning for, they can decide to erase humans completely from Thasia. There is also an issue of recovered cassandra sangue who are still vulnerable, so Meg is trying to come up with solution that will help them cope and come up with sensory overload and their addiction to cutting. Ok, Meg was never my favorite heroine, since she lacks moral complexity (any complexity, in fact) that would make her more unpredictable and able to surprise me, but I understand why author made her that way. Through her innocent, unbiased and inexperienced pov, we are able to get true, filterless picture of what's going on. Humans, the way Others know them, are either stupid and meat or cunning and manipulative, so they can only provoke one reactions with in them: distrust. But Meg, the way she is, makes a believable catalyst for change in their opinion that all humans are only meat. There are some developments in Simon's character since he is trying to maintain this delicate balance and help humans who are considered friends. There is full on segregation going on because of HFL (Humans First and Last movement), so anyone who is working with Courtyard suffers the brunt of it. It struck me that, as much as he kept his inhuman and utterly wolfish nature throughout entire novel, he pulled some serious political moves and made progressive changes that are not typical for terra indigene. Anyone who is looking forward to romance development, I have to disappoint you- nothing yet. In fact, it was less obvious than ever and, frankly, considering Meg's fragile mental state, her lack of experience and troubles they are dealing with, I am more comfortable this way.I chucked the star off because this reads like \"build up\" piece- Beside major moves, all characters are also performing these little,mundane, everyday tasks.It felt dragged out or, maybe, with third book, novelty of Meg's work in liaison office, pony's stumping, Skippy's antics, etc. is simply not as riveting for me as it was first time around. But, while reading all these scenes, I couldn't shake off the feeling there is something huge coming up. Like there is a lot of things going on but everything that's happening in this book is only teasing the real conflict in the future.I hope in next book, we'll finally get to read about Cel-Romano, since it's a place controlled by humans- I am curious how's that working. I think terra indigene can expect upcoming attack from them since everything is pointing toward the fact they are gathering troupes. Drugs that affect Others, food supplies and humans always had numbers on their side- war is coming. :)"}, {"userName": "Katie Michaels", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4669344-katie-michaels", "userReview": "The Meg is back! Well, she is not actually The Meg anymore. She's Our Meg and that may be even better.If you have no idea what I am talking about, you are clearly missing out on one of my favorite Urban Fantasy series and you need to stop what you are doing and go buy Written in Red. No really. Do it now.This third installment picks up right on the heels of book 2. It follows Meg as she continues to find balance, free of the Controller and the Walking Names who shaped her life for so long. She has come a long way, but she still struggles with her need to cut. Now it's not just her life on the line, but the lives of all the girls rescued who are like her. Meg needs to understand herself and her triggers in order to help those like her survive in the outside world.Meanwhile, tension is nearing the breaking point between humans and the Others. Right in the middle of it all are Monty and his little girl, Lizzie. We've heard from the beginning how hard it has been for him to be apart from her. Now, circumstances are reuniting them, but at what cost? There are humans vying for supremacy and making the very big mistake of forgetting who the real dominant species is on Earth. It's a powder keg just waiting to blow.There are so many things I like about these books. The world-building is fantastic. Yes, there is a glossary and some made up words, but it's nothing that is going to make you feel lost. In fact, it's really very easy to fall into this world without having to give it much thought at all. I also really love the Others of the Lakeside Courtyard. Simon, of course, is my favorite, but I'll get back to him in a minute. Tess is such a fantastic secondary character. I also love Nathan, Henry, and Sam. It's fascinating watching how they interact with Meg... how they are evolving. They are monsters, no doubt, but the deeper we get into these books, we see how much more monstrous humans can be. Ooooh. And they are gonna get theirs.My only small niggle: I am ready to move a little bit further in the relationship between Simon and Meg. I know this is not a romance and I understand why they're not doing the dirty in one of the upstairs rooms. But Anne Bishop keeps dropping all of these little hints that something is happening there. For three books, something has been happening. The thing is, I need a little more something. When it takes three months to culminate in holding a hand, well, we might could pick up the pace just a bit.I didn't find this installment quite as strong as the first two. Overall, though, this remains a consistently fantastic series. It's entertaining, easy reading, and still thought provoking. Would definitely recommend.Rating: B+*ARC provided by publisher"}, {"userName": "Alexa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17295220-alexa", "userReview": "I\u2019m not sure why I gave this one the same rating as the last two.It\u2019s still good and I pretty much inhaled it the minute it was released, but it had several problems, the first being that things start getting repetitive, like these kinds of comments: \u201ccassandra sangue retained the sweetness of a child\u2019s heart,\u201d or \u201cthey were Namid\u2019s creation, both wondrous and terrible,\u201dYou told me already, let\u2019s move on!My other problem with the book is that it tries to fix a plot problem by reversing character development. Meg has been a strong character in her own way so far; she escaped the compound, found the others, got a job, learned to cook, drive, make friends, etc. Now suddenly OUT OF NOWHERE, she\u2019s having meltdowns every few chapters because \u201cshe can\u2019t cope with change.\u201d Are you fucking kidding me? -.-The real reason she\u2019s having meltdowns is because the other Cassandra Sangue that were released in the last book are having meltdowns and they need Meg to have some too, so she can explain how to deal with them. It just didn\u2019t make sense for the progression of the character and annoyed me SO MUCH.Also, there\u2019s still no romance. Which wouldn\u2019t usually be a problem for me but the author keeps hinting at it and it is starting to grate on my nerves.The plot follows the ideas planted by the past two books about the conflict between the Terra Indigene and the Humans First and Last movement. So far our new villain, Nicholas Scratch, seems to be just as distant and non-involved as the controller and while I enjoy the book, I miss having a villain that I can hate. I\u2019m also still curious to see if future books will show us a bit of the conflict that\u2019s happening in the Cel Romano Alliance of Nations. (Pretty please?)I was really interested in the new Cassandra Sangue girl they added and hopefully we\u2019ll be seeing more of her.PS. I don't like this cover. Meg looks weird. Also, her hair should be short!Re-read in Feb 2016 for the release of Marked in Flesh"}], "description": "The Others freed the\u00a0cassandra sangue\u00a0to protect the blood prophets from exploitation, not realizing their actions would have dire consequences. Now the fragile seers are in greater danger than ever before; both from their own weaknesses and from those who seek to control their divinations for wicked purposes. In desperate need of answers, Simon Wolfgard, a shape-shifter leader among the Others, has no choice but to enlist blood prophet Meg Corbyn\u2019s help, regardless of the risks she faces by aiding him.Meg is still deep in the throes of her addiction to the euphoria she feels when she cuts and speaks prophecy. She knows each slice of her blade tempts death. But Others and humans alike need answers, and her visions may be Simon\u2019s only hope of ending the conflict.For the shadows of war are deepening across the Atlantik, and the prejudice of a fanatic faction is threatening to bring the battle right to Meg and Simon\u2019s doorstep\u2026", "title": "Vision in Silver\n      \n          (The Others #3)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489473-vision-in-silver", "average": 4.27, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1479581400l/25489473.jpg", "reviews": 2150, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/26897.Anne_Bishop", "name": "Anne Bishop"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Paranormal", "Paranormal"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489473-vision-in-silver", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21457243-vision-in-silver", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22456990-vision-in-silver", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25083430-vision-in-silver", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15711341-written-in-red", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17563080-murder-of-crows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47956.Daughter_of_the_Blood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47959.Queen_of_the_Darkness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47957.Heir_to_the_Shadows"]}
