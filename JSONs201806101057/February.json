Every man on it died.\u201d\nHelen O\u2019Mara\u2019s husband Cal was one of the victims, and she is devastated by his death.  \u201cHow to put into words the tumult of pleasure her life had been; how to say she had lost something big and was left with a hole in the middle of her chest and the wind whistling through.\u201d She has to forge a new life for herself and her three children, and she has discovered that she is pregnant.Cal\u2019s death was also particularly traumatic for their son, John. John felt as though his father had abandoned him, and when his mother went to hospital for her confinement he fretted that his mother might have died too.February\u2026In February 2009 the O\u2019Mara family will once again experience a major change in their lives. John\u2019s brief and long since forgotten fling with a woman has resulted in pregnancy. \u201cSomething old-fashioned, a rogue honesty Jane Downey probably wasn\u2019t even aware of and couldn\u2019t control \u2014 that\u2019s what he\u2019d seen in her face. A girl from Alberta who was writing a PhD thesis in anthropology. She was in Iceland for an academic conference and they met in a bar.\u201d Jane has finally decided to inform John that he is the father of the child, and that the unexpectedly expected baby is due in February. John who is totally discombobulated by Jane\u2019s news turns to Helen for advice.In a series of flashbacks this beautiful novel relates how Cal\u2019s death affects the family, particularly Helen and John. Even years after the tragic event, Helen still misses Cal. \u201cCal has been dead twenty-six years and she is capable sometimes, for a stretch of time, of forgetting Cal has died and how he died.\u201d She thinks of the little things. She longs for companionship. John also thinks about little things, such as \u201cAn eyelash on his mother\u2019s cheek.\u201d or the washer overflowing whilst his parents were in their locked bedroom \u201casleep\". Helen, John and Jane\u2019s thoughts and feelings are revealed as they ponder the imminent arrival of a new baby.February offers a new life, a new chance\u2026#####Quotes:\u201cIs this what a life is? Someone, in the middle of cleaning the bathroom, remembers you tasting the ocean on your fingers long after you\u2019re gone. Someone draws that out of the fog, draws out that memory, detached from circumstance, not locatable on a timeline.\u201d\u201cHelen unlocks her front door, holding an armful of groceries, and there are three empty floors and silence. It is a relief. Solitude, she thinks, is a time-release drug, it enters the system slowly and you become addicted. It\u2019s not an addiction; it\u2019s a craft. You open the closet doors very carefully so loneliness doesn\u2019t pounce out.\u201d\u201cHelen has mastered loneliness; nobody thinks of her as lonely any more.\u201d\u201cIf she had been honest she would have asked: Could you be my dead husband for an afternoon.\u201d\u201cWhen Jane had finished studying the street people, she experienced a glimmer of what it might mean to be invisible, to live without a trace, to hurt nothing.\u201d\u201cThe present is always dissolving into the past, he realized long ago. The present dissolves. It gets used up. The past is virulent and ravenous and everything can be devoured in a matter of seconds.\u201d\u201cThe past yields, it gives way, it goes on forever. The future is unyielding. It is possible that the past has cracked off, the past has clattered to the floor, and what remains is the future and there is not very much of that.

I read slowly right from the start, so that I could absorb each essential phrase, to appreciate how one sentence moved to the next, to marvel at a particular paragraph, or to pause at the end of a subsection to reflect on the way Lisa Moore had crafted a scene. February is a fictional story about how one Newfoundland family of five deals with the loss of husband and father Cal, in the real-life tragic sinking of the offshore rig, the OCEAN RANGER, on Valentine\u2019s Day, 1982. The main characters are wife Helen, eldest child and only son John, and, in flashback scenes, Cal. Secondary characters are Helen\u2019s sister Louise; Jane, connected to John; and John\u2019s three younger siblings: Lulu, Cathy, and Gabrielle. Then there is Barry, the man who not only renovates the house, including choosing the correct paint, but eventually alters Helen\u2019s life. Like a watercolour painting, Moore builds layer upon layer to build the story from its foundation to its final coming-together. Part one begins November 2008 with son John phoning his mother from Singapore. He asks her: Have you ever tried to figure out the difference between what you are, and what you have to become? This is essentially the theme of the novel. Then Moore whisks us to February 14, 1982 when the OCEAN RANGER begins to sink. John and Helen are presented as more affected by the loss than his three sisters. Back again to John, as Jane, the woman he spent a week with seven months ago, informs him she is pregnant. This is the present-time story-line. His mother would force him to do the right thing, whatever that was. She would know. But the heart of the book chronicles Helen\u2019s decades-long grief over the loss of her husband. Flash back to 2008 and her delivery of Gabrielle, the youngest child, born after Dad drowned at sea. Then, Call me when you get to New York, his mother said. We\u2019ll talk about the baby. Moore has created an interesting structure here. Five sections are broken into subheads with titles, including dates for each. Most of the story takes place during 2008: June, August, October and November; not in order, and mostly in November. The rest slips back to 1972; \u201975; \u201978; \u201980; 82; \u201987; \u201995; \u201997; more emphasis on February, 1982, but again, not chronological. And finally, the fifth part takes place in January and February 2009. (The book\u2019s release date was June 1, 2009.)The writing is also interesting: Lisa Moore writes the way we often think, with thoughts jumping at random. As with the structure, this semi-stream-of-consciousness style is a very effective way to draw us in and really experience Helen\u2019s grief. At times, Helen\u2019s view of the past and the present reflect a distorted view of reality; thoughts that create images like one of those carnival mirrors. Except that rather than comic, more often the optical-feeling effect is of multiple parts, missing parts, huge parts; memories can loom large, or have pieces missing, or be jumbled together. The present can be distorted by memories of the past. Juxtapose this with clarity of vision that is so startling it can leave the reader gasping. With such structure and writing style, one might think the story would be difficult to follow. On the contrary: it serves to add breadth and depth \u2013 of feeling, of sensory detail, of the moment-to-moment momentum of observation, as when her father-in-law phones to tell her he\u2019d identified Cal: Helen lost her peripheral vision. She could see a spot about the size of a dime in a field of black. She tried to focus on the surface of the kitchen table. It was a varnished pine table they\u2019d bought at a yard sale, and in that little circle she could see the grain of wood and a glare of overhead light. She had willed the spot to open wider so she could take in the bowl with the apples and the side of the fridge and the linoleum, and then the window and the garden. Her scalp was tingling and a drip of sweat ran from her hairline down her temple. Her face was damp with sweat as if she\u2019d been running. Which brings me to the use of light as a motif, starting with the very first lines: Helen watches as the man touches the skate blade to the sharpener. There is a stainless steel cone to catch the spray of orange sparks that fly up. Here is Helen, up at 4:00 a.m., on the night the rig began to list, though she doesn\u2019t know that yet. There\u2019s a storm happening outside:But then a plow came down over the hill and it was bleating and the revolving light on the top of the cab struck the frosted window and Helen could see thousands of crackles and crystals and grey shimmer burning as white as flashbulb, violet-white, just for an instant, burning so fiercely it hurt somewhere behind her eyes.It hurt somewhere deep in her skull. It felt as though the light had pierced her, gone through, and the mad design of the frost, infinitely curling in on itself, had been printed on her retina. It felt like a puncture. A rapture.\u2026the light hitting the frost at that second had refracted, each minute crystal a hall of mirrors, so that the intensity was hugely magnified. If only I could quote three pages (!) here, because it all ties in with her being pregnant; and leaving a pot burning on the stove, and hurling the pot outside into the snow; and dreaming of Cal, and being afraid.February is the shortest month of the year; but it often seems the longest, at least in parts of Canada, when winter can be unrelenting; will February never end? Helen\u2019s grief is relentless for twenty-six years. For me, Helen\u2019s grief was an intimate experience; at once familiar and fresh at the same time. It may sound contradictory, but it never seemed morose; there was beauty in Helen\u2019s memories, in her grieving. In writing this story, Moore knew that she had to reveal glimpses of the intense love Helen and Cal shared; so that we could understand how much Helen had really lost. The bright flame of their love extinguished in a flash when Cal died, plunging Helen into an inward life of loneliness, of darkness. But like the seasons, in the end, Helen cycles back to emerge from the dark into light once more. February is a passionately crafted story that rang true to me, true to life."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie", "userReview": "The oil rig \"Ocean Ranger\" began to sink off the coast of Newfoundland on Valentine's Day 1982. The rig was gone, and every man on it perished in the stormy disaster by the next day. Helen O'Mara was left with three children, and a fourth on the way, when her beloved Cal died.\"Somehow Helen had picked up the idea that there was such a thing as love, and she had invested fully in it. She had summoned everything she was, every little tiny scrap of herself, and she'd handed it over to Cal and said: This is yours....It wasn't just dumb luck that Cal knew what the gift was worth; that's why she gave it to him in the first place. She could tell he was the kind of guy who would know.\" (49) Grief and love are all wrapped up in each other in this book. The story goes back and forth between the present and the memories of Helen and her eldest child John. Themes of death and birth are strong with Cal's death followed by the birth of their fourth child, and a later subplot about the February birth of John's child.Lisa Moore's writing is sensuous and real.

My goal this year was to read each of the five \"Canada Reads\" choices, so that I could follow along with the CBC debates. These were supposed to be quintessential Canadian novels - the cream of the crop.Perhaps I made a mistake in trying to read this during February itself - the most grey, depressing time of year here. Maybe in the summer I will try again. In the meantime though, there was so much I just could not like: the main characters frustrated me, I found the portrait of the widow/mother to be heavy-handed. (\"I get it,\" I thought, over and over again. \"She's a widow, the whole thing is tragic. Yes, yes, she's been very stoic...\")And then the complete lack of quotation marks. Again, I get it: the author clearly wants us to look at the story as though we were looking through the lens of a camera, or leafing through old photos. Perhaps it's my own prejudice, or being far too much of a stickler for grammar, but damn it, use the punctuation you were given as a writer. It's not \"stylish\", not \"bold\" - it just makes your prose more difficult to read, and is distracting to boot. I'm against the vandalism of library books... but ye gods!

I don't want to appear insensitive to the people affected by that tragic event. The families and friends of those lost have my sympathies.But I really didn't like this book.Lisa Moore writes beautifully descriptive passages. She writes beautifully descriptive passages about scattered, disconnected and, frankly, not very interesting events. Finishing this book was a chore, and I only did so because I had to give a full report to my book club. I procrastinated about picking it up again every time I put it down. I groaned when I finally succumbed to the need to plough through it. I impatiently skimmed through the tangential ramblings of the narrator.The main character, Helen, loses her husband in the Ocean Ranger disaster. She has three children at home and a fourth on the way. Understandably, she's shell-shocked, and this book is the story of how she picks up the pieces of her shattered life.The theme resonated with other members of my book club\u2014a single mother and a widow\u2014who felt that Moore had done an admirable job of capturing the emotional journey of people suddenly left to cope on their own. I agree, but Moore captures it, perhaps, too well. Passages rife with non sequiturs and leaps between topics effectively represent the scattered thinking of someone in shock, and I would have liked that approach, if Moore had used it only for the parts of the book that take place immediately after the disaster. But Moore uses this style through the whole book, and it's tiresome. Moore is so busy describing random events and the characters' inconsequential encounters with strangers (that do nothing to advance the story) that she leaves unfinished the story lines we readers are hungry for. We get a lengthy passage on dolphin training, but we don't know what happened to Gabrielle, the baby born in the womb at the time of her father's death. We get an entire short chapter on how Helen and her husband were once on opposite sides of a tug of war, but we're left hungry for more details on the intriguing story line of her son's job skirting safety regulations for oil companies.The whole book was haphazard and exasperating. Too many self-indulgent descriptions of details that don't advance the story. Too many leaps between topics within the same passage. Too many leaps back and forth and all around in time.Oh, and I'm going to send Lisa Moore some quotation marks for Christmas."}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "Some may say that this is a book about death or life or love, but for me this is a book about the \"ifs\" and the \"whens.\"The plot is irrelevant because whatever the plot is it is only the plot because of the perspective from which the story is told.

And in those fragments is one of the truest stories I've ever read.I've read better from Lisa Moore (very slightly better), but there are few -- and only a few -- authors who can write as well as Moore on her worst day let alone her best.

It's not an addiction, it is a craft.\"On Valentine's Day 1982, the Ocean Ranger, an assumed-to-be unsinkable oil rig, sank during a vicious storm out in the North Atlantic. Thirty years later the tragic events of that night still resonate deeply with the affected communities of Newfoundland. Families lost fathers, brothers, sons and lovers during a night when hope and prayers for a miracle turned into despair and grief: all eighty four crew were lost, either on board or in the ice cold water. Newfoundland award winning author, Lisa Moore's 2009 novel February fictionalizes the deep physical and emotional shockwaves in the aftermath of the disaster by telling the story of one widow, her profound grief and the long-lasting scars on her soul while putting all her energy into bringing up her family and healing herself. Lisa Moore's heroine, Helen, thirty at the time of the disaster, was robbed of her husband Cal, the love of her young life, the breadwinner for their young family with three small children with a fourth on the way. Much of the story is set in 2008, yet with Helen's mind often wandering back to that fateful night in 1982, the innocent years prior to the disaster and the many years since. Helen reflects on her emotional state of mind at the time as \"being outside\": \"The best way to describe what she felt: She was banished. Banished from everyone and from herself.\" Still, the daily life had to go on while grief and pain were kept locked into the inner folds of her mind. \"Helen wanted the children to think that she was on the inside, with them. The outside was an ugly truth that she planned to keep to herself.\" Grief, as we know it, is unique to each person, intimately personal and not always easy to understand for others. Moore's capacity to capture and express the individuality of Helen's grieving in a way that we as readers can relate to it in our own personal ways, speaks to the quality and thoughtfulness of her writing. In 2009, I have to admit, this was not a book that I wanted to read, given my own recent loss, but four years later, I can appreciate Helen's story and the winding and twisting process of her coming to terms with her grief and her life. February is in no way a sad or depressing book. Moore brings enough detail to Helen's life moving forward to keep the reader supportively engaged. Helen is surrounded by her three daughters and John, her oldest. John is a major character in the novel and we follow his growing up from the ten year-old at the time of the disaster to a young man who develops his own means to deal with loss. The image of the absent father is well developed through John's and Helen's recollections. As a result, Cal remains very much a part of the novel. Even after many years, Helen's mind keeps returning to the night of the disaster. Not knowing what really happened in the last hours of Cal's and his mates' lives, does not let her rest. What did they know and understand of the crisis? \"They all knew they weren't safe. They all knew. But they had decided not to tell anyone. But it leaked out of them in larks and pranks and smutty puns, and it leaked sometimes out in a loneliness that made phone calls from land hard to handle.\"February is not a chronological account of Helen's efforts \"to get back on her feet\". Not at all. Like memories and dreams, the narration jumps timelines, joining unrelated events or triggering sudden vivid images. Moore's narrative flows from the present in 2008 to 1982, the other still vivid present, to times before and in between... Sometimes her chapter dates give you an indication where we are, often, though, she relies on the reader to figure out where Helen's mind is at that moment. And, with a bit of reading into the novel, you do. Moore has a subtle and compassionate way to convey her character's story. At times, her writing structure reminded me of a puzzle, where, unexpectedly, one small 'piece', be it somebody's gesture or the colour of the ocean on a misty night, connects several until then unconnected images and a broader perspective falls into place. Overall, this is a beautifully developed and affecting story, set in a broader context that is relevant as much today as it was then. Some of the side stories seem to be more than complementing the central story and distracted to some degree. The novel's ending may not be to everybody's liking, but these, in the end, are minor irritants."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl", "userReview": "This book languished in a stack on a to-be-read shelf for almost two years, squashed between a Julian Barnes below and some short story anthology above. It was 31 years ago on Valentine's Day that the Ocean Ranger oil rig sank off the coast of Newfoundland, killing all aboard.31 years later, on Valentine's Day yesterday, February won the Canada Reads award. (Oh crap, now the masses will like it, it will be popular, and more often than not that means the writing sucks, but jeez, it's Lisa Moore, she's a good writer. She has cred!) I kept putting it off, fearing the mawkishness that was sure to fill the pages of a book about a widow of one of the dead crewmen. But that's not how it turned out. This isn't about wallowing in grief and outrage. It rises above that. The narrative skips around in time, both directly and indirectly as memories and dreams. This seems ideal for this type of story, because the present is so pregnant with the past. Very slowly the widow Helen begins to weave the future into her existence. The structure, the architecture were great, but what I enjoyed the most was Moore's expressive prose. The effortless hyper-realism of her descriptions brought it to life, and overarching it all were quiet wisdoms and simple but profound insights.

The past, the sinking of the OceanRanger in 1984, continually intrudes upon the present as Helen lives herlife under a cloud of grief and survivor guilt.But Lisa Moore does not allow her characters to wallow in their griefnor does her book at any time descend into sentimentality.

It's a sweet story of family who lost their patriarch, Cal, when the Ocean's Ranger sunk in 1982.I think the metaphor Moore creates among the O'Mara family parallels Newfoundland economic recovery apres-Crosby. John, the only son goes to Fort MacMurray to build a career in Oil and Gas (specifically Non Destructive Testing, which you can study online at SAIT! A link is below!) and the sub-tragedy of Newfoundland culture being siphoned away by the west. Moore's story is one of hope and how the family eventually puts itself together again, perhaps like Newfoundland has since the collapse of the cod fishery. It's really lovely and I looked forward to coming home to this book everyday.I have memories of seeing Knowlton Nash explaining the news - that the North Sea had swallowed the Ocean Ranger and the poor 84 souls on board in the middle of the night on Valentine's Day.

Her writing is beautiful on the reader's \"ear\" so to speak, and the images it calls forth are vivid and detailed. The novel has no particular sequenced narrative but repeatedly takes the reader from era to era, and back again, in protagonist, Helen Omara\u2019s life before and after the death of her husband, a victim of the sinking of an oil rig, Ocean Ranger, off the coast of Newfoundland. Moores's device unfolds as a sequence of sharply defined scenes and deeply felt experiences from one family\u2019s world. As such it builds up a powerful impression of what it must be like to be Helen, with minute details of her exterior world and tremendously moving passages that bear witness to her rich but harrowing interior world. There were times when I became perhaps a little too aware of the writing craft. Does that mean that Moore\u2019s brilliance is too self-conscious? Maybe, but it\u2019s a small quibble. I also sometimes found parts too repetitive \u2014 the same thought or event described several different ways \u2014 which was doubtless purposefully wrought, but almost made me skim over a paragraph or two. I never did, which is a testament to the leeway one is prepared to give to such a marvelous writer. Or, as Richard Ford, describes her on the cover of the book, \u201cAn astonishing writer.\u201dI thought the last section made for a remarkably powerful ending to the book, one of the best \u201cconclusions\u201d I\u2019ve ever encountered. If the book had been a lesser one it would have been worth reading for those last paragraphs. But, as it is, \u2018February\u2019 is worth reading for almost every single sentence."}, {"userName": "Allyson", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2266545-allyson", "userReview": "I may have rated this book more highly had she not used the strange chapter jumps or whatever they may be called. I can't help but think it is an author weakness to do so as unable to maintain a narrative momentum otherwise. I am now reading her 2005 novel Alligator so may be unfair to compare. Although it also jumps between separate characters, repeatedly. Am only just started and may sign off without finishing if it is too annoying. There are too many good books to read without convincing myself to read one slightly irritating structurally.I really thought her thoughts regarding death, survival of death or after a loved one's death were original, interesting, and believable. She was able to develop John as a character in addition to Helen, and all this despite the jumping back and forth between characters and years. I wished she had not done so and felt it would have been a tremendous novel otherwise, but this was a little too distracting to me. And I absoultely hate this cover- struck a discordant note every time I opened or closed this book. Luckily it was a fast read.Talk about false advertising- I know it is superficial, but a cover draws me in or repels me, falsely at times. I wonder how many great books I have missed due to unappetizing or offputting covers.

I'm not much in to slow-paced books without a strong storyline or intense characters. But, because of its rave reviews, and an understanding that it is important to break custom once in a while, I gave it a go. Although I'm not likely to recommend it to anyone that is not grieving a profound loss, I'd say I still enjoyed certain elements of the story. At its core this is a story about bereavement, and how the occurrence of bad weather and senseless errors can turn a life upside down. Lisa Moore\u2019s depictions of feeling \u2018outside\u2019 of the reality that continues to plug on in the aftermath of tragedy, how loneliness or flashbacks to happy times can pull you away from the surface and hold you hostage deep in your mind, will leave anyone who hasn\u2019t experienced such loss, with a palpable understanding of its destruction. The prose can be choppy and the narrative disjointed, as it skips back and forth between past and present, but if you're patient you'll find the flow.

Still, great read."}, {"userName": "Gail", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93751-gail", "userReview": "Even though I JUST finished this novel, I feel like I read it in a fog of some sort. Kind of like, have you ever answered your phone half asleep and had a five-minute conversation with someone, only to remember a vague outline of what you just discussed? Where I give Lisa Moore three stars is for the story itself. I feel as though she got so caught up in the WAY she was telling it (jumping back and forth between character narratives, hopping around from decade to decade) that she let the story get TOO caught up in the past, saving the future for literally the last 10 pages. And while I know this book is about a woman who has never gotten over the death of her husband (a death that came on a cold winter night with dozens of others aboard an oil rig off Newfoundland), Moore pretty much beats us over the head with the fact. Hereeeee comes the BUT...BUT, where I give Lisa Moore FIVE stars is for the way she writes. I read this book in chunks here and there over the past week, and I've concluded that is precisely the way it should be read. Because if you plow through its pages, the richness of these details will be lost on you. Those descriptive scenes will feel like a chore to get through instead of moments to be savored. And you'll miss the enjoyment of Lisa Moore's bird's-eye view on life, feeling as though you are there with her as she listens and observes and makes notes for her novel. Consider how she describes what one of her characters witnesses entering a Toronto pizza shop:\"The walls of the narrow pizza shop are mirrored and the lone customer leans into his pizza slice, and as he bends forward his image splits where the mirrors meet in the corner and there he is, an infinite number of times, his woolen coat and plaid scarf, pulling a piece of pizza away from his mouth, thousands of him, an indefatigable army of the same man having to lean forward after his food...\"Have you, or have you not, BEEN IN THIS PIZZA SHOP BEFORE? But, no way could you write a sentence that gorgeous, right? And THAT is what I love about Lisa Moore's writing. It was this thread of fly-on-the-wall scene-setting that pulled me through \"February\"'s otherwise halfhazard plot. And while I took a go at Moore earlier for Helen's constant heartache, I will say, on certain pages of this book, Moore writes on the subject with such honesty and grace her words make you want to melt. To illustrate, I'll end with this scene, one in which Helen is contemplating online dating at the urging of her daughters (four children she was left to raise after becoming a widow):\"If she had been honest she would have asked: Could you be my dead husband for an afternoon. Could you put on his clothes, I still have them. Will you wear the cologne he wore. Will you smoke Export As, just for an afternoon. Will you drink India beer and burn the steaks on the barbecue, will you be funny and tell jokes and leave groceries for the family down the road who have no groceries. Could you be Cal?\"Hauntingly beautiful, no?"}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23122402-daniel", "userReview": "This novel follows the life of a fictitious O'Mara family whose husband/father (Cal) was lost in the Ocean Ranger tragedy of 1982. The majority of the novel is from the perspective of the widow (Helen), but some of it is from the perspective of the son. The story of this family is quite compelling, and it draws you in.I really wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't get past the writing style. I'd pick it up, suffer through a chapter or two, and then leave it on the bedside table for another week before I had the mental fortitude to pick it up again. I found that the author chose two elements which, although I somewhat understand the reasoning for doing so, I found very distracting from the story itself. Firstly, the author flits back and forth in time. In one chapter, it's the near-present day. Then it's the 70's, then the near-present day, then the 90's, then the 80's, then back to the near-present day. And so on, and so on. Only the very last chapter is the actual present day. This style gives you the general impression that you're just following Helen's conciousness as it meanders through time. She remembers little vignettes of how she and Cal met, various snippets of their children growing up, segments following the aftermath of the disaster on the rig, and longer moments of how's she's coping on her own now that all her children have grown up and moved out. I could see no rhyme or reason to the sequence of the flashbacks, and it didn't flow well.Secondly, the writing is very casual. There are no quotations to separate speech from thought from narration. It usually only became clear after you finished the sentence or paragraph whether it was something the main character said, or saw, or heard, or thought. The narration is also overly colloquial, using fantastic traditional Newfoundland syntax and diction. Again, this gives the impression that you're just following Helen's conciousness and memories, as opposed to witnessing the events themselves.While both of these elements do give it a more personal feel - it almost feels as if Helen is just telling you her life story in whichever order the various elements drift to the forefront of her mind - I found it very disjointed and unnecessarily gimmicky.I can appreciate that other readers of a more literary persuasion have thoroughly enjoyed this book, and it no doubt deserves all the accolades that it received, but February was not really my cup of tea."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23418160-peter", "userReview": "\"Have you ever tried to figure out the difference between what you are ... and what you have to become?\"This is just one of many questions and puzzles that Lisa Moore presents her readers in February. For the most part, this book is an enjoyable read. If you want a chronological narrative, with a clear arch of a story, this book is not for you. If, however, you step back and realize that the central core of the novel is of a horrendous disaster that occurred on Valentine's Day, 1982, at that this day set in motion multiple reactions of people's hearts and minds that stretch forward to the present, and also rebounds in people's memories prior to the central event, then you will be grounded.The sinking of the oil platform strikes the motif of water in this novel. Newfoundland is an island, thus surrounded by water, one of the central character's is the father of a child conceived in Iceland, another island, and when that woman's water breaks nine months later, a new life is born, one that will, in part, replace the loss of the new child's grandfather lost when the the oil rig sank on that faithful February day. Cal, the man who lost his life that fateful day was a man who feared water, and decades later his wife finally remarries and realizes her life is born again, as she watches her new husband emerge from the ocean on their honeymoon. And so the question posed of what a person is to become is partially answered by Lisa Moore. Essential, also is the title of this novel. February. Just as most people know where they were on November 22nd, 1963, and again in July 1969, and then again on September 11th, 2001, so every Newfoundlander knows where they were on February 14th, 1982. The novel February is a novel of time and place, and how people remain locked into a specific time and place but yet must still move beyond that selfsame location.The novel's style reflects the jumbled moments of a person's life, the style accentuates the jagged edges that record our days and ultimately the style enfolds us into the chaos that is existence."}, {"userName": "Tina Siegel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3827161-tina-siegel", "userReview": "Again, Moore's prose is lovely. She's got a gift for being poetic without descending into overwrought emotionalism. And I love her ear for the salty tang of Newfoundland English. Moore has certainly captured the devestation - and even the terror - of the Ocean Ranger disaster. Her descriptions of the rig's last moments, and the men in the water, are gut-wrenching. I did feel like some of her transitions could be better, particularly in the beginning. There were times when I didn't know what, or who, to focus on because she didn't give us any signs; other times, I ran smack into great big billboards advertising the change. These could have been smoothed out. Towards the end of the book, though, she got better or I accustomed myself to the style, because it stopped bothering me. One of my two criticisms of the books is that I wanted more dialogue. Moore uses it so sparingly and, even when she does, it's often folded into the larger narration. It gets lost. I also wanted more distinction between the characters when they did speak - they all sounded roughly the same in my head. I feel like the way we communicate, the words we choose to use, reveal a lot about who we are. Our manner of speaking, our linguistic quirks, our tone of voice - these are all part of what we present to the world and, for me, it was missing in February. I couldn't hear the characters, couldn't distinguish between them when I did, and it distanced me from them.In some books, this wouldn't be as much of an issue. But here, all the action - the most dramatic events - have already happened, and the only ocnnection we have to them is through these characters. I wanted to be closer.My second criticism is that I didn't buy the ending. It happened too fast, and I had no indication that Helen was truely interested in Barry. As far as I could tell, she thought he was attractive, nothing more. Certainly not someone she'd want to marry.Having said all that, I think it's a remarkable book. Moore packs an enormous emotional punch in less than 200 pages.

Not only was her gripping new book \"Caught\" put on the short list for the Giller Prize, but this emotionally powerful 2009 novel won this years CBC Canada Reads award. This is a beautifully structured and deftly written collision with tragedy and death. The focus is a loving but vulnerable woman, Helen, whose husband Cal dies with 83 other oil rig workers in the 1982 Ocean Ranger sinking off Newfoundland -- leaving her with four young children to raise. This is on one level the brave story of her toughening battle to overcome poverty and loneliness in the years that follow. And on another level this is an account of Helen's attempts to think fully through her understanding of what has taken place and then to continue somehow to live. This description may suggest a morose and dispiriting book, but that is not the case. Helen has a stubborn vitality that makes her an endearing character -- when she is struggling with the clutch to learn to drive or chasing young bullies into the waves to protect her small son. The rich texture of Newfoundland life and the diversity of its people shine out from all the pages of this novel. \"Caught\" is a book with a compelling plot, while that is less the case with \"February.\" But this book digs more deeply into the heart and soul of its central character. The result is a very fine novel -- and a fierce dissection of love and death and tragedy in our secular society."}, {"userName": "Caren", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2610234-caren", "userReview": "I happened upon this author when reading reviews of her newest book.

I only need to say that I became so engrossed with the characters, I was thinking of them and carrying the book with me, trying to devise more occasions to read. I haven't been so besotted with a book since I don't know when. The writing is well-considered, precise, and oh so wise. The sections may seem fragmented at first, as they skip between characters and points in time. As the novel proceeds, this begins to feel very natural, just the way a human brain works.

It begins in the present-day, more than twenty-five years later, but spirals back again and again to the \"February\" that persists in Helen's mind and heart.Writing at the peak of her form, her steadfast refusal to sentimentalize coupled with an almost shocking ability to render the precise details of her characters' physical and emotional worlds, Lisa Moore gives us her strongest work yet. Here is a novel about complex love and cauterizing grief, about past and present and how memory knits them together, about a fiercely close community and its universal struggles, and finally about our need to imagine a future, no matter how fragile, before we truly come home.
