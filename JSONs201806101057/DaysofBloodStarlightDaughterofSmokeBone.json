You know how, at the end of Romeo and Juliet, Juliet wakes up in the crypt and Romeo\u2019s already dead? He thought she was dead so he killed himself right next to her?\u201d\u201cYeah. That was awesome.\u201d A pause, followed by \u201cOw,\u201d suggested elbow punctuation on the part of Mik.Karou ignored it. \u201cWell, imagine if she woke up and he was still alive, but\u2026\u201d She swallowed, waiting out a tremor in her voice. \u201cBut he had killed her whole family. And burned her city. And killed and enslaved her people.\u201d (Days of Blood & Starlight, chapter 47)This is approximately the circumstances in which we find Karou and Akiva at the beginning of Days of Blood & Starlight. All available blurbs and summaries are a little coy and vague about what this sequel has in store for its readers. Wonder no more. This is a dark, brutal novel with a war at its core. At the opening, Akiva just gave his seraphim brotherhood all the tools to destroy chimaera, and chimaera...well, they are almost completely eradicated as a nation. Karou is chimaera's only real hope of survival. No more talk of romance and love in this story. Akiva and Karou are in different camps now, with an abyss of resentment, guilt and disappointment separating them.I have already heard a few voices upset by this almost-no-romance development. Not everyone wants to be torn away from the heavy romantic story line of Daughter of Smoke & Bone and face the ugliness of never-ending war where nobody wins. But for me this trilogy is better for it. I am not the sort of reader whose attention can be held for long by romantic angst. I love reading about love, but I am not of the opinion that just love can sustain a series of books. Something bigger than that has to be at stake. In this book, there is, and it pushes all romantic woes to the background. And understandably so, considering the nature and severity of the rift between the lovers. Can you continue loving someone who initiated genocide of your nation? Will you expect to be forgiven for killing off your beloved's entire family? Probably not.Days of Blood & Starlight also gave me more in terms of storytelling than I had anticipated. I didn't expect at all to be so deeply submerged into the world of chimaera and seraphim, to get to know it so intimately. I remember getting only a glimpse of Eretz in Days of Blood & Starlight. This sequel is an adventure through the Emperor's harem, chimaera's tribal villages, seraphim barracks, ruins of Loramendi and excesses of Astrae, and then a look at what is is BEYOND the borders of the land known to Akiva and Karou. It is such a pleasure to read something about a world that has so much depth to it, to feel like I will never know the full expanse of this world and every wonder it holds. The masterful twists at the end left me hungry for more and more, because as much as I know about Eretz now, I also know how much there is still left to explore.Days of Blood & Starlight may be not as quirky and charming as its goulash- and skuppy mischief-filled predecessor, but it's a novel that encourages you to contemplate the consequences of war for both winners and losers and futility of revenge. Even though I missed Prague and ever annoying Kaz a little in Days of Blood & Starlight, reading it was still a pleasure, albeit a pleasure of a different kind."}, {"userName": "Etnik", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34369915-etnik", "userReview": "5 SMOKING STARS!\nDaughter of Smoke & Bone Review\nThis is the best sequel I have ever read.The first book was great ,but this one...perfection.Everything fits amazing,the characters had a truly development,they are perfectly explained and described,the background is smoky cool,and antique.The story is mind blowing,written so smart.There were some moments I was speechless,like what just happened.\nYou can find the full review and more about this book on my blog\n____________________________________________\u201cOnce upon a time, an angel and a devil fell in love and dared to imagine a new way of living\u2014one without massacres and torn throats and bonfires of the fallen, without revenants or bastard armies or children ripped from their mothers\u2019 arms to take their turn in the killing and dying.

What are we killing for? What do you see when you look into the future?\"\nGone are the first book's spunkiness and lightheartedness, and (thankfully!) the annoying romance angle (even though the deceiving and useless cover of this book may wrongly lead you thinking otherwise). Instead the darkness and dirt and tiredness and betrayals and pain and weariness and hopelessness and violence and vengeance and grim determination set in, and it is so much more realized and gripping and touching than I hoped - having lived up to the promise that the first book in the series was trying to set up. Days of Blood and Starlight are filled with blood and not that much starlight, after all. This book does not shy away from pulling gut punches, sometimes in a dirty way. And I loved it.\"A dream dirty and bruised is better than no dream at all.\"It's not often that a sequel is stronger than it predecessor, but it's the case here. Laini Taylor unflinchingly minimized the wonder and cuteness and romance and instead focused on creating a rich landscape devastated by war, and characters wounded and scarred by it, and yet caught in the relentless cycle of violence which breeds more of the same.\"In the cycle of slaughter, reprisal begat reprisal, forever.\"............\nKarou is hardly recognizable as the spunky blue-haired girl full of vitality that we came to love. She lost everything she held dear and permanent in her life, and is barely a shell of her old self, consumed by regret and shame and guilt which, honestly, she really does not deserve (and the frequently annoying in its persistent cheerfullness presence of Zuzana is a painful reminder of how different Karou's life has become). She is a shell-shocked survivor, and she tries to navigate her way through this new world in a daze, relying on pain and wearing herself out. The fire seems to be gone out of her for a while as she resigns herself to being a necessary albeit unwanted and resented player in the game - a puppet to be tolerated until she can be replaced. She does what she thinks needs to be done - and there is nothing warm and fuzzy or comforting about it. I have a soft spot for reading about those scarred by painful experiences, and Karou wins my heart with her plight. And yet she is determined and strong, with more steel in her backbone than I can imagine - because who could have doubted that she will eventually find her way? \"Be your own place of safety, she told herself, straightening. No crossbar in the world could protect her from what lay ahead, and neither could a tiny knife ticked in her boot - though there her tiny knife would most certainly remain - and neither could a man, not even Akiva. She had to be her own strength, complete unto herself.\"Karou - resourceful, strong, level-headed, self-sufficient - you are still welcome to join my literary BFFs circle. Really.And on the other hand, we have Akiva - the hated (at least by me) romantic interest from the first book, who (and that's a tribute to Laini Taylor's skill, I must say!) unexpectedly has enough character development for me to come to understand him and even grudgingly respect him. Akiva genuinely is trying to set things right - and not only because of his love for Karou but also, it appears, because of realizing how little cruelty and vengeance are actually worth. He is allowed to develop on his own, and not just as a part of a standard cutesy couple that he almost became with Karou many moons ago.--------------.........The big theme of this book, the one that kept resonating with me, was the futility of violence and the longing for compassion and mercy and peace. The uselessness of adhering to the 'eye for an eye' approach to vengeance and violence is repeated over and over and over again. Because, as we have seen so many times in our real world, the natural compulsion is to answer violence with more of the same, to wreck vengeance, to make the other side feel your pain. Many seemingly 'righteous' wars, even recently, have been started on this idea, and the results of them have never been satisfying, have never been worth it; instead, only more suffering and pain was dealt to those caught in the middle of the fighting. ******Breaking something is always easier than building something new - but it is rarely a sustainable solution to the problem. It seems so devastatingly simple - but yet so often overlooked, so often trampled in the search of more rewarding 'justice' - which causes more pain. The vicious cycle, isn't it? The futility of it is so obvious in literature, like this book, but why are we so blind to it in real life?******I can easily see this book not having such a following as the first book in the series did - because of the pronounced darkness of the tone and the decided lack of romance. The tensions are about the power, not about love. The conflict is not because of feelings but because of grim reality of war and power struggle. But this shift in tone and emphasis is what made me a fan of this book, and is what makes me really look forward to the next one in the series. Because sh*t is getting more real, believe me. And I want to learn more.4.5 stars, without hesitation. I will even round up to five, given how much I enjoyed it.

Really? It would be a sin! Days of Blood and Starlight is the fantastic sequel to the very well loved Daughter of Smoke and Bone, where we met the lovely Karou and her unimaginable surroundings. Both the characters and world building in this series are created wonderfully and incredibly vivid--which is surreal for such an imaginative fantasy world. While we are taken on a mind blowing journey when this world unravels in our minds in Daughter of Smoke and Bone, its sequel doesn't have the magic of learning the world, the fascination of experiencing for the first time what Laini has created. This is often the downfall of sequels; we know it, we want to move forward, and although this one didn't completely fall prey of such stalled sequels, it does take quite a while to get the ball rolling. The first half of the book, albeit still interesting, even a little nostalgic, feels like it will never end. This does happen to be about 250 some pages\u2026 Finally, when certain secondary character become a bigger part of the story the pace is, or at least feels, like it's finally moving forward. These characters really bring so much energy into this novel that it almost completely changes the tone of the book once they're in the picture. But it's not just them, so much stuff has started to happen all around. Now it's fun, exciting, intense, funny, emotional; all the reasons I loved the first in this series has come to the forefront. The first part of the book may be slow, but the second half is full of wicked fight scenes and great plot advancement that make you forget it was even slow in the first place. I was especially taken by the abrupt plot happenings that Laini decided to add in this sequel. I think maybe I don't expect very important things to happen in the middle child of a trilogy, so I'm very happy when we actually get some things checked off the list!Having learned who she really was, and what her world consists of, Karou is clearly not the same young, carefree teenager she once was. She has become tough, determined, with some very hard edges. The character growth is there and it makes complete sense with story developments we went through. I love how she becomes who she has to be to make things right for her people. Her loyalty is admiring and a great quality in a protagonist; you can easily understand her, root for her, and sympathize to her situation. The side characters, the monsters, the creations, everyone is so alive in this novel! One example of excellent writing!The character voices, the incredible world, the fantastic fight scenes (especially in this sequel); it's elaborate without being overdone, it's pretty without being clich\u00e9. It's all so attractive! Obviously, I highly recommend this series, especially to fans of fantasy--in which I am not, so doubly great if you are! --An advance copy was provided by the publisher for review.For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Meredith Holley", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1302775-meredith-holley", "userReview": "[killin\u2019 ev\u2019yone you loved (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Keertana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7584700-keertana", "userReview": "If Daughter of Smoke and Bone was a dream, a mirage, a masterpiece of writing and phrases and words, overlapped and edited and fine-tuned to create a perfection of romance, snark, and pulsating chemistry, all tinged with a palpable undertone of bittersweet, Days of Blood and Starlight is like a hard slap, the cold splash of water, and the startled opening of ones eyes into the bleak, war-ridden, fragile, and bloody reality of life. Unlike most trilogies which follow in a steady rhythm of romance or action or paranormal mystery, Laini Taylor breaks all imaginary constraints and reveals to us the completely unexpected, for Days of Blood and Starlight is as far removed from its predecessor, Daughter of Smoke and Bone, as any novel could possibly be. In fact, the only similarities between the two lie in Taylor's atmospheric writing, her distinct characterizations, and the general plot continuation. In all other aspects though, Laini Taylor has surpassed my wildest expectations and written a novel that I can claim, in full confidence, that is far, far better than its predecessor. I gave Daughter of Smoke and Bone 5 Stars, just as I did Days of Blood and Starlight, but in reality, this novel deserves 500 Stars. Days of Blood and Starlight picks up not long after Daughter of Smoke and Bone ended with Karou coming to the realization that the only family she's ever known has been murdered by the only man she's ever loved. Thus, the tone for Days of Blood and Starlight is set; one of revenge, grief, heartbreak, sorrow, despair, and yet, despite all that, hope. What stands out the most, to me at least, is how real Taylor's novel is. Both Daughter of Smoke and Bone and Days of Blood and Starlight unfold in a sequence of events driven by fate, by destiny, and not entirely by choice, much like our own lives. While we all do have a certain amount of say in the direction our lives lead us, it is only by fate that we meet the people who will change us or affect us in different ways and no one can deny that, at the end of the day, despite all the scattered events throughout our lives, everything comes together and makes a certain degree of sense. Things happen for a reason. For me, Days of Blood and Starlight seemed to echo that very same idea. All the events in Karou's life, first as Madrigal and later as Karou, were leading her up to this point. In fact, nothing could have progressed in this manner if Madrigal had not fallen in love with Akiva, if she had not been beheaded by the Wolf, and later if Akiva had not destroyed Loramendi, the home of the chimeras. This, I feel, is the magic of Laini Taylor's writing. Or perhaps it's the magic of her plot. Either way, her stories unfold in such a realistic manner and best of all, she ensures that all this is palpable to the reader. Karou already made a niche in my heart in Daughter of Smoke and Bone but with Days of Blood and Starlight my heart wept for her. We see Karou at her most vulnerable and, at the same time, her most strong - mentally at least. It can't be said that Laini Taylor doesn't allow her character to grow, for she does. Each and every character we come across, from Akiva to Hazael and Liraz, his siblings, to Zuzanna and Mik, all experience some type of growth and change throughout this book. Akiva, especially, becomes a truly fleshed-out being, one whose personality is no longer as flat or connected to Karou's love as it once was. Now, seeing him as an individual with regrets, grief, and aspirations of his own, it is far easier to grow to truly love him as another person and not simply as Karou's lover. Furthermore, Laini Taylor simply outdoes herself with the world-building in this piece. Somehow, the battered, torn, and bloody land of Eratz has become such a real place in my mind that I wish to visit it and see it, for its simultaneous beauty and terror, all at once. Yet, for all its good qualities, I do have a few minor qualms with this novel, primarily, the set-up of the book itself. Unlike Daughter of Smoke and Bone, Days of Blood and Starlight flits between the perspectives of Karou, Akiva, Zuzanna, and a plethora of secondary characters we are unfamiliar with. While I enjoyed, for the most part, the round and full picture this type of storytelling provided us with, I also found that some small chapters could have been entirely done away with. I kept expecting them to play a greater role in the novel, and unfortunately, they didn't. In addition, the secondary (or quarterary?) characters we're introduced to have such little screen time that it's tough to feel anything much for them beyond fleeting thoughts. Nevertheless, that is a small qualm to have with a novel so perfect in every other way. Days of Blood and Starlight exceeded all my expectations (and mine were HIGH!) and surprised me with an uncanny amount of depth and a shocking slew of plot twists that had me simultaneously thrilled and upset. Furthermore, the amount of emotion this novel inspires is noteworthy. Taylor makes you feel for Karou and Akiva and while their romance, and their interactions for that matter, is extremely minimal, the bittersweet tone of their love is still felt. Neither Karou nor Akiva is at fault here and Taylor makes us see this so clearly in this piece that now, it is impossible to know in what direction the story will head. It ends off, much like Daughter of Smoke and Bone did, with a bittersweet kind of ending that leaves you aching for more, worried for these characters, and at the same time, filled with hope. I doubt I'd trust any other writer to take on such a complex novel - for truly Taylor has transformed a simple love story and made it into an intricate piece that leaves me with the knowledge that I still haven't understood it all, not fully. Needless to say, I cannot wait for the final installment in this trilogy. If there's anything I can count on, it's this: Laini Taylor will not disappoint.

I\u2019ll read it. Nay, I\u2019ll devour it. Breathe it in and hold it in my lungs for as long as possible before I\u2019m forced to exhale or lose consciousness. I\u2019m not saying that she\u2019s exempt from using some of the above themes and tropes. Hell, I think this book has all of them. You know what makes it so different? It\u2019s the beautiful writing, the pacing of the story, the incredible characterization, the depth to which she delves, the entire execution really. Unlike so many others in this category, she makes these overused themes believable, relatable, and addicting as fuck. Therefore, she gets ALL THE STARS.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest"}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38077205-hannah", "userReview": "IM A MESS THIS DESTROYED ME AND IT WAS AMAZING"}, {"userName": "Whitney Atkinson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson", "userReview": "I'm currently mourning that I don't own the third book :/I like this series!

I want to address the all-important question of whether Taylor has an obsession with the letters DBS or not.Okay, fine. Not relevant. Really\u2026.party poopers.Most of us had to prepare ourselves for the fact that DoBaS, like most middle child books, was probably not going to be quite as good as it\u2019s older siblings. Personally, I always hold out hope for middle child books, wanting to be pleasantly surprised!Well, the pessimistic, miserly old grinches win out this time because DoBaS isn\u2019t quite as good as its predecessor, but it\u2019s certainly nothing to turn your nose up at. But, you know, if you were to turn your nose up at any Laini Taylor book then, my god, have you no soul?!Taylor\u2019s books have intense and varied themes. DoSaB\u2019s themes revolved around perception, love and loss, the pain of emptiness and coming of age issues. DoBaS deals a lot with losing/regaining hope, faith in oneself, forgiveness of oneself and others.In a lot of ways DoBaS is a different creature to DoSaB. DoSaB had limited PoV changes that largely existed between Akiva and Karou (I think \u2013 my memory is really dodgy) and DoSaB was really more Romantic up until the very end. And by Romantic I don\u2019t necessarily mean the relationship between Akiva and Karou because I ultimately think DoBaS was more romantic than its predecessor though it may not seem intuitively so. It was more Romantic in the sense that the characters and the story are so much bigger and more mature. There\u2019s these two amazing, independent forces of fate building up behind Karou and Akiva. The more they come into themselves and become wiser, the more they\u2019re drawn together.Daughter of Smoke and Bone is a naive, sweet innocent first love. Appealing to many, but I liked the relationship dynamics even more in Days of Blood and Starlight. They\u2019ve both lost that naivette, grown as people. They have more baggage to deal with and the relationship they\u2019re building feels stronger \u2013 erected on foundations off a deeper understanding of themselves and the world \u2013 and they still can\u2019t help but love each other. After all they\u2019ve seen, all they\u2019ve done, all that\u2019s been done to them \u2013 they\u2019re still drawn to each other like moth\u2019s to flame.Laini\u2019s writing is beautiful. If anything she has improved and the inherent poetry to the writing has become sharper and more poignant. Where a lot of people, including myself will get tripped up at is that pacing and structure of the novel. It is very meandering with an excessive number of POV changes. There\u2019s a lot to follow, a lot happening all at once and the cast of characters has expanded exponentially.But, over all, I loved it. I\u2019m so enthusiastic for the next book. I absolutely have to know where this series is going, what\u2019s going to happen to them and whether I\u2019m just as naive and foolish as Akiva and Karou for hoping and thinking that they will eventually have some form of happy relationship at the end of this series.TAYLOR MARRY ME I LOVES YOU!This review also appears on my blog, Cuddlebuggery Book Blog."}, {"userName": "Kimi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17065991-kimi", "userReview": "[ Get Ziri back to his own body for God\u2019s sake.

Laini falls on the idea-rich side.In the past, you might have seen my enthusiastic gushing about book 1 and how I likened it to word porn. Because, you know, that's what it was - porn for the brain that wants to live in a realm of lush visuals and beautiful prose. Book 2 was no different, yet it somehow was. I completely understand why so many people love book 2 even better than the first, but I'm going to come clean here : I struggled to get through the first half. The PoV's were jumping all over the place, the scenery was going back and forth, and I really just wanted to see a certain two individuals come face-to-face again.But then I hit the 50% mark. And it was like brain orgasms all over the place. Because, you know, (yes...I'm wearing this phrase out) - MOTHEREFFING WORD PORN. All of a sudden, I could see the pretty colors. All of a sudden, my chest started aching with longing for certain things to happen. All of sudden, I wanted to retrieve every single thing which had been lost. \n\nI lost my soul. I lost our dream. Vengeance eclipsed everything.\n\nHow does this woman/author/creative goddess do it? I want to bottle her secret. I want to see each and every single chimera and angel in my head but can't wrap my mind around it. I need to have these visuals brought to the big screen because my tiny little brain can't fathom how awesome all of these creatures must look.And Karou...Akiva...the emotions...all over the place, just as my jumbled review thoughts must be. How do I explain the large scope of issues that are Karou and Akiva? How can I even begin to explain the feels these two put me through? And Ziri - oh how I wanted to hug Ziri.\n\nHer name means hope. But not in their language, and not for them.\n\nIf you haven't started this series yet and desire to want to live in a place where fantasy meets reality, in a moment of time when two worlds collide, get ready for something like you haven't seen before and might never see again.BUT...don't do what I did and read books 1 and 2 so far apart. I think I might have given this book 5 stars if I'd read it right after book 1. It's a shame that I struggled so much to get my love back.

This story mostly focuses around Karou working as a resurrectionist in the desert where she builds new bodies for the souls of dead chimaera. The war is brutal, widespread, and pretty much the main focus of the book. Basically everyone's in a bad situation and it's looking pretty bleak. Akiva is with his half sibling seraphim and then there are a few other perspectives from new characters thrown in to emphasize the scale and threat of the war.My absolute FAVORITE part of this book was Mik & Zuzana (Karou's best friend from the first book). They are so stinking adorable and brought some much-needed lightness to the story. They find their way to Karou, where Zuzana uses her puppet skills to be the Igor to Karou's Frankenstein. I heard there's a novella about Mik & Zuzana and I'm super excited to read that too! (Update: it was adorable. And now I heard it's being published next year so yay).So there were some parts of the story I liked, but as a whole it was pretty depressing. (Oh, and rape trigger warning btw). I like the threat of the apocalypse for earth and everything, buuuuut the story did get to be a bit of a downer for me. I mean, I absolutely adored the magical, almost whimsical quality of the first book! I like magical settings that have an element of hope, mystery, or possibility to them... and that is exactly what this book was missing. That makes sense and works for the story, so it's not a bad thing. It's just why I'm not quite as enthusiastic.I also wasn't terribly into most of the story since Karou & Akiva spent so much time apart and the plot was slower (and just death, death, death), but there were several scenes that made me sit up like \"woah, THAT is a cool idea.\" The writing was still just as wonderful!!And the stuff between Karou and Akiva was actually pretty emotional in this book -- I was a lot more invested in their relationship here! Karou explains their Romeo & Juliet situation as \"imagine if [Juliet] woke up and [Romeo] was still alive, but he had killed her whole family. And burned her city. And killed and enslaved her people.\u201d So they're going through a rough patch..."}, {"userName": "TheBookSmugglers", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1223249-thebooksmugglers", "userReview": "Original review posted on The Book SmugglersWarning: this review contains inevitable spoilers for book 1 in the series. Trigger warning: rape.Laini Taylor is doing really interesting things with her series. When it comes to romance in the Paranormal/Fantasy YA landscape, more often than not the reader is presented with truly problematic pairings where rape culture is normalised and where insta-love is presented as par for de course and in lieu of actual romantic development.Daughter of Smoke and Bone was a book with a very strong focus in the romance between Karou/Madrigal and Akiva. A romance that was not only forged on the insta-love Furnace of Doom but also one depicted as having the no holds barred/soul mates kind of dynamic. That love was all the more impacting because it was also an impossible romance between enemies who dared to dream about ending the war between their people. At the end of that book, we know how well this turned out (not): Madrigal was killed but eventually resurrected as memory-less Karou. Akiva, thinking Madrigal was well and truly dead, went on a killing rampage. It ended with Karou recovering her memories and realising what Akiva had done and the two breaking up, therefore subverting the usual YA romantic trope and that was AWESOME.At one point in Days of Blood and Starlight, Karou says that their story is like Romeo and Juliet\u2019s but instead of waking up to find that Romeo had committed suicide, she wakes up to find out that he went on to decimate not only her entire immediate family, destroy her city and then proceed to commit genocide against her entire race. Lovely.And that\u2019s the actual starting point here: the insta-love that doesn\u2019t work and is not rewarded for its wtfuckery. The story then in Days of Blood and Starlight deals with the after, with the guilt, with Karou finding out that HOLY CRAP, she dared to dream of love and that\u2019s what happens when you hook up with a fanatical dude. Because there is no denying: Akiva has lost his shit so completely and how do you come back from that?You can\u2019t. Because genocide: not an acceptable response to your lover\u2019s death.Akiva knows that. Karou knows that. And so they are apart. And in the \u201capart\u201d, they come to realise that their dream of peace needs to be bigger than their dream of togetherness.But enough with the romance because unlike what I might have led you to believe with my rambling above, this book is not about love at all, it is actually about war. Karou is back with the few surviving Chimera, working alongside Thiago, the abhorrent man who killed her, in order to create an army of monsters to avenge their people.In the meantime, there is a lot of emotional angst here. Karou is drowning in guilt for daring to fall in love with the enemy and mistakenly equates her dream of peace and love with the ensuing mass-murders on both sides. Part of her journey is realising that the love and the dream are not the problem. Revenge is. But before she gets to this realisation, the Karou of the first book is replaced with a meek, emo-version of herself, someone who makes terrible, stupid mistakes in the name of making amends (at one point I actually expected Akiva and Karou to burst into singing \u201cI had a dream my life would be so different from this hell I am living\u201d).And it\u2019s like, being complicit with genocide: not an acceptable response to your guilt.Sorry, going back to the romance briefly: I do wonder what is going to happen. Because surely there is no way to mend this. NO WAY. There can\u2019t be. Especially considering that yes, Akiva feels immense guilt, but his guilt comes only once he knows Karou is alive. If she was still dead, I got the feeling he would not feel this way. And I have a sneaky suspicion that because both of them have been involved with mass killings to some extent or another, in some creepy way all could be forgiven in the end because both did unspeakable things? Like in a really wonky, problematic mathematical equation in which each other\u2019s actions are annulled like they never happened or something because\u2026 True Love. Surely, this is not where this story is going, is it?And I can\u2019t begin to express how fucked up this is, and how terrible the consequences are. And it becomes really clear, really soon, how their world is the shittiest place EVER. Both Angels and Chimera are immersed in this bloody war and holy crap, this book is dark, violent and emotionally draining and at points I just wanted to stop reading and get out just so I could breathe. In fact, reading some pages felt like being punched.Laini Taylor is a brilliant writer and there is no denying that the harrowing version of Karou\u2019s story is as engaging and beautifully written as its lighter companion (book one).Those things said, I can\u2019t help but to think that structurally speaking this book is a bit of a mess. There is a lot of head-hopping with random characters providing the point of view for a couple of pages then disappearing altogether from the narrative.There is also a point toward the ending of the book where the narrative \u2013 which thus far had been linear \u2013 becomes choppy as it goes back to hours or days before a certain point in the present time just so there could be an extremely contrived \u201cgotcha\u201d moment.Zuzana and her boyfriend Mik, as awesome as they are \u2013 and I mean it, I just love their love story as well as the loyalty and friendship between Karou and Zuzana \u2013 had no place in this story. Although I get the intention of adding a lighter tone to an otherwise grim story as well as giving Karou some footing in the human world, their presence in the proceedings felt forced and their comic lightness was misplaced in the midst of such portentous happenings.Finally, part of me wonders if some of this violence isn\u2019t a bit gratuitous, just to make a point. And then you have an extremely violent and completely unnecessary attempted rape scene. As though there wasn\u2019t enough evidence of the violent and abhorrent nature of the attacker already so let\u2019s add humiliating sexual violence toward its main female character as well.Ultimately, Days of Blood and Starlight is an emotionally impacting book with a solid story and good overall plot developments. But unfortunately, it is nowhere near as awesome as its predecessor.But, as I said before: Laini Taylor is doing really interesting things with her series. I just don\u2019t know how I feel about them. I do remain curious to see where it goes though."}, {"userName": "Regan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19645927-regan", "userReview": "This book was amazing. I enjoyed the first book, but this one was leagues ahead. The one thing I really appreciated about this story was the tone. I felt that Laini Taylor expertly captured the feeling of war. Taylor painted both sides as exhausted and frustrated, the soldiers were unable to articulate why they were fighting anymore. All they knew was blood. There was this air of hopelessness, this feeling that neither side was winning, that both were destroying themselves. But even within this desolate landscape Taylor also sprinkled in small flames of hope to keep us going. This book was wonderfully written, and I cannot wait for the final book in the series coming out in April. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Elise (TheBookishActress)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52545435-elise-thebookishactress", "userReview": "I have to admit, I wasn't worried I wouldn't love this. I loved book one, after all! But this sequel is even better. In terms of character work and romantic arcs, I'm amazed at how far Laini Taylor has come. HOW THIS BOOK LIVES UP TO BOOK ONE\u2022 The writing here is possibly even more beautiful. Laini Taylor's writing flows across the page to the point where instead of skipping across paragraphs as I usually do, I was hanging on her every word. It's so simple and yet so gorgeous. I'd read her grocery lists. \u2022 This book is a complete mindfuck. Most of the twists towards the end are sheer brilliance. Taylor draws so many tiny threads into one beautiful big picture. This book makes it so you can guess all the twists, but you probably won't because they're never-before seen. \u2022 This isn't your typical angels vs. demons story; angels aren't all good and demons aren't all bad. I loved the nuance of their conflict. There's something to be said for taking an old story and making it something new, and I loved Laini Taylor's execution of this story. HOW THIS SEQUEL IMPROVES ON BOOK ONE The worldbuilding here is just awesome. It's even more complex than it was in book one, with a detailed world map and more complexity. I am shocked at how many side characters I fell in love with here. Karou's bravery and loneliness still shine brightly as ever. Her inner conflict over the Chimaera war stands out here; it's handled with nuance and grace. Liraz surprised me with her character development and nuance. Her brutality and desire to be more than a machine mix to form an extremely compelling character. Ziri's character surprised me as well; his conflict between ingrained prejudice and caring for others is very well-executed. Side characters like Hazael and Issa return, more fleshed out than ever, but possibly my favorite part was seeing little flashes from chimaera and angels caught up in a war beyond their control. Sarazal, Sveva, and Rath managed to touch my heart in the space of a few pages. Most changed award has to go to Akiva. He's changed so much since book one, where I liked but didn't love him. Here, he's an incredibly compelling character; a character who's made huge mistakes and owns up to them.Improbable as their relationship is, Karou and Akiva are such a compelling couple. Their scenes here were few and far between, which served only to make them more tear-worthy. The touch of instalove from book one has become a complex relationship full of moments that touch your heart. They're seriously on the track towards becoming one of my top six couples. And of course, Zuzana and Mik are still delightful. I'm really glad Karou has girl friends and the book isn't a mess of slutshaming. These two also add a touch of humor to an otherwise disturbing story. \n\u201cWhat is it about you?\u201d she had asked him recently. \u201cI almost never like people, even in tiny doses. But I never get tired of being with you.\u201d\u201cIt's my superpower,\u201d he had said. \u201cExtreme be-with-able-ness.\u201d\nThis book is far darker, thematically, than DoSaB. Days of Blood and Starlight is a war epic, not just the story of a demon and angel's forbidden love. Everything lovely about the first book is simply one part of a whole story. There's so much nuance to both the themes and the characters; this is a book you could analyze for hours. Honestly, I think my feelings are best summed up my initial review being \u201cI'm dead inside??\u201d This book absolutely killed me, and I can't wait for book three. I know everyone has read this series already, but if you haven't, PLEASE pick it up. This is so much more than a cliche love story; it's about tragedy and war and prejudice and oh my god, please just pick it up."}, {"userName": "P ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25327841-p", "userReview": "\u201cOnce upon a time, an angel and a devil held a wishbone between them.And its snap split the world in two.\u201d\nThe first line of this book gave me goose bumps.

Karou and Akiva have to face their faith in this book, it's not something can be solved by a word. Their conflict is bigger than the world they live. I can understand very well why Karou did that to Akiva in the previous book. But it defintely broke my heart into a million pieces instead of the fact that this book was lyrically written.

Or stay above and face the angels.\nSo this book was a real downer.Days of Blood and Starlight had all the tried & true elements of a typical second book in a series. Much of the plot was occupied by characters trying to deal with the fallout ending of Daughter of Smoke and Bone, and the setup for the series finale. I would have been disappointed if those two points were the exclusive focus of the book, but Laini Taylor managed to introduce interesting new characters and flesh out the older ones a bit to keep the story fresh and gripping.New Stuff: Ziri, Ten, and the other chimaera in the desert were all good additions to the series. I expected the Seraphim to completely annihilate their race, but the chimaera powered through and seemed to have a fighting chance to survive, as a whole.Ziri is my new favorite! He's brave, open-minded, sweet, and resourceful. I'm dreading the day Karou breaks his heart, but it's totally going to happen because Akiva and Karou are endgame. Ziri I'm so sorry :'(Old Stuff Revisited: Mik and Zuzana brightened the whole book and kept me from falling into a pit of misery while reading. Some chapters were very grim and depressing, but Zuze and her boyfriend managed to make me feel better without fail! OTP.We got a closer look into the dynamic between Akiva, Liraz, and Hazael. I loved that.Unfortunately there was a distinct lack of Akiva/Karou scenes, a contrast to Daughter of Smoke and Bone where the whole plot revolved around their relationship. Akiva and Karou met only twice in Days of Blood and Starlight, spending the rest of the book learning to cope separately. When they did meet it was painful to read, what with all that emotional fuel. Akiva was drowning in self-hate, and Karou chastised herself for every moment she didn't hate him too. Nothing like their sweet, burning love months before :( However the ending gave hope that Akiva and Karou can find their way back together. *cries for Ziri* I'm starting the next one right away."}], "description": "In this stunning sequel to the highly acclaimed Daughter of Smoke and Bone, Karou must come to terms with who and what she is, and how far she'll go to avenge her people. Filled with heartbreak and beauty, mysteries and secrets, new characters and old favorites, Days of Blood and Starlight brings the richness, color and intensity of the first book to a brand new canvas.", "title": "Days of Blood & Starlight\n      \n          (Daughter of Smoke & Bone #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17162795-days-of-blood-starlight", "average": 4.19, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1370836169l/17162795.jpg", "reviews": 11604, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/324620.Laini_Taylor", "name": "Laini Taylor"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2899437.Khristine_Hvam", "name": "Khristine Hvam"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Romance", "Fantasy", "Paranormal"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17162795-days-of-blood-starlight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12812550-days-of-blood-starlight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13503544-days-of-blood-starlight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14742503-days-of-blood-and-starlight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13389182-days-of-blood-and-starlight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8490112-daughter-of-smoke-bone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13618440-dreams-of-gods-monsters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28449207-strange-the-dreamer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34733250-night-of-cake-puppets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6369113-lips-touch"]}
