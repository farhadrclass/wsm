Mathewson's erudite descriptions of early 20th Century baseball are fascinating and insightful. His musings really bring to light how the game we watch today came to be.Also, the chapter that describes Pittsburgh as the fancy town full of rich society people, with all its industry money and tycoons, in comparison to the relatively low-rent New York City, was hilarious. Once player even manicured his nails before trips to that city for fear of being made fun of by the snobby snobs there."}, {"userName": "Thom", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom", "userReview": "The author was a very successful pitcher at the time this book was written, and unlike most autobiographies today, was also a decent writer. Chapters of this book read like newspaper columns (which some of them may have been), expounding on the pitchers views of managers, hitters, fielders, pitchers, and umpires. As much anecdotes as analysis, this easy-reading book remains relevant today.

He pitched for 16 years in the big leagues, won 373 games (185 more than he lost) with a career ERA of 2.13. His teams were twice World Series champions, including in 1905 when Mathewson pitched three shut-outs. Simply put, one of the best starting pitchers ever. The book, a collection of themed essays written by Mathewson with the un-credited help of newspaperman John Wheeler (though now credited thanks to Red Smith\u2019s afterward) for syndication after the 1911 season. A year later they were collected into a book that was very popular from its publication in 1912 and beyond. In Smith\u2019s essay he talks about borrowing it from the Green Bay library as a kid and wearing out the pages.Reading Pitching in a Pinch a 102 years later is interesting, informative, and often entertaining but there are redundancies and dry patches. Unlike Lawrence Ritter\u2019s The Glory of Their Times it is not essential reading, but if you\u2019re a fan of the game and its history Mathewson and Wheeler provide sufficient insight, color, and story-telling to make this a pleasurable experience. Mathewson pitched mostly his whole career in the \u201cdead ball\u201d era. A time when small ball was the rule and home runs were rare. The bunt base hit and sacrifice, the stolen base, the RBI groundout, flyball or single, were the ways runs accumulated. The ball was dirty and erratic, gloves small, infields and outfields irregular with stones and ruts. To underscore the point, Mathewson gave up one of the most famous home runs of that era, one that tied a crucial game in the ninth inning. The hitter was then christened \u201cHome Run\u201d Baker, although he never his more than 12 in a season. The essays here talk about inside baseball in a colorful blend of baseball argot, spiked punch journalism and clear prose. Some meanings have changed. A \u201cgroove\u201d in Mathewson day was the area of weakness in which a player could be handled. Some have stayed exactly the same. The balance of recognition and surprise in the language of the game is one of its pleasures.The book's topics include how managers impact the game, the role of superstition, legal and illegal cheating (stealing signs from the dugout, coaching boxes or basepaths being legal, but using binoculars from the scoreboard and an electrically wired messaging system being illegal), how crowds affect players, spring training, etc. The essay on jinxes is very entertaining but also cringe inducing as one jinx buster used by a team was to keep a hunchback as a team mascot so players could rub his hunchback on the way to the field or a more universal one among the all white players of the day was to rub the head of a \u201ccolored person\u201d. Other superstitions were more benign. A bunch of empty barrels, for example, was supposed to be good luck for hitters. (Why? One of the game\u2019s divine mysteries.) His team lost in a slump, Giant manager John McGraw arranged for several days that a horse drawn wagon stacked with empty barrels just happened by streets his players traveled to the ballpark and, as they encountered the wagon, his players in commuter groups of one, two and three escaped from their slumps. Inside baseball at his best."}, {"userName": "Chris Witt", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223580-chris-witt", "userReview": "Another book you'll want on your shelf if you're a fan of the Deadball era.Also something you might want to read over if you are a sim player (Strat, APBA, Replay, Diamond Mind, etc.) who is playing a season from the first decade of the 20th century.This happens to be the 100th anniversary of this writing, as it appears this was put out sometime during 1912, the season after Matty and the Giants were taken down by \"Home Run\" Baker and the powerhouse that was Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics.Mathewson opens up a lot about his New York Giants teammates from the first 12 years of his playing days, and if you are at all a fan of John McGraw, there's plenty of material in here of you. I have to admit that as much of a fan as I am of the Deadball Era, I really don't know too much more about \"Mac\" other than \"Well, he sure won a lot of games\". \"Big Six\" will give you some inside information here on how McGraw was able to routinely maximize his team's chances of winning games.One thing that really struck me as I read through the book was how much of the strategy and talk about the inner workings of the game are really not too different from the way the game is still played today.I believe this is actually freely available on sites like Project Gutenberg, so if you have any interest in just reading it and don't necessarily need a bound copy, you can always hop over there and check it out.http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33291"}, {"userName": "Cody Grady", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9502342-cody-grady", "userReview": "Pitching in a Pinch is one of the original baseball books written by one of the premier pitchers of the early 20th century. McGraw was an outstanding manager for the Giants and was a genuine creator of the \"small ball\" style of play. Throughout, Mathewson details a reader with strategies for double steals, baserunning, \"honest\" sign stealing, and the psychology of the batter and hitter. These strategems are interwoven with real life situations where they were used, making this an interesting historical piece... it seems that baseball hasn't changed much over the years.Beyond the historical relevance of the piece, though, there is little to gain by reading it. Mathewson is clearly not a good writer, tending to ramble with little aim or purpose other than to tell a few old baseball stories. As for using this as a teaching tool, almost anyone with a working knowledge of the basics of the game will know what Mathewson is describing... these tricks are still around, so there's no great reveal. Still, a good read for any baseball fan with a sense of history. It is astounding how similar the game played today is to the one played 100 years ago this year.PUBLIC DOMAIN PUBLICATION READ ON KINDLE FIRE."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/775366-jim", "userReview": "This is a fascinating look at baseball from the inside, in the early days of the major leagues and the first two decades of the twentieth century (ghost-)written by one of the great stars of the game. Mathewson, one of baseball's most magnificent pitchers and an intelligent and erudite man, allowed his friend, newspaperman John Wheeler, to expound upon the art of playing baseball as though Mathewson were himself telling the stories. No doubt, Mathewson had a good deal to say himself, and there is a mixed air about the book, one of authenticity mixed with what passed for lighthearted literary flair in the press of the 1920s. In any event, there is a lot of fun to be had in the musings about various players, teams, and umpires, and some additional amusement to be found in the differences (and similiarities) of the game then and now. Surprisingly, in those long ago days when coaches were called \"coachers\" and pitchers most frequently referred to as \"twirlers,\" some of the sophistication of modern baseball is evident, and it is clear that the brainy, strategic game played today is nothing new. PITCHING IN A PINCH is an interesting flashback to a time when the game was young and naive, but not nearly so naive as one might think."}, {"userName": "Lee (Rocky)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/296706-lee-rocky", "userReview": "Despite the title, this book isn't really about pitching specifically. It's written by one of the great pitchers of the early 1900s, and there are bits of it that do talk about different types of pitches, and pitching strategy. Most of the book though, waxes philosophical about the best ways to play the game, by way of lots of anecdotes. Parts of it come across as horribly dated, mostly in terms of the language he uses to describe things, and the baseball terminology used at the time (but also the chapter about superstition in baseball included the idea that some players found it lucky to rub a black child's head, and names a player who claimed that this was the cause of his hot streak at the plate). Reading this did give some interesting insight into the life of a professional baseball player 100 years ago; it was interesting to read the different anecdotes and what he was saying about them, and thinking about which of them still seemed relevant to the game today and which ones didn't."}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1025126-alan", "userReview": "I loved this book! Christy Mathewson is arguably one of the best pitchers to ever \"twirl\" (his expression, not mine). He writes about the game of baseball in the early part of the twentieth century with joy of a child. Much of the game has changed - spit balls are illegal, players are over-paid, and teams take planes instead of trains. However, much has stayed the same - the strategy, the jinxes, and rivalries. What I really enjoyed is that \"Matty\" had no filter - no one could get away with this today - he calls Honus Wagner a \"bow-legged Dutchman\" (which I assume was quite an insult at the time), he quotes his famous manager, John McGraw as saying, \"the only good umpire is a dead umpire\", and he refers to a rival player as having a \"spine like a charlotte russe\" (which I'm not sure if that's good or bad). My favorite quote: \"All coaching, like all Gaul and four or five other things, is divided into three parts...\" Awesome!"}, {"userName": "Pete", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/676532-pete", "userReview": "Superstar athlete as-told-to's are pretty much the same, although this one has a few yuks resulting from being 100+ years old. The part about the umpire who was especially vain about his hairpiece is pretty funny. Interesting to think how much sports-stardom has changed since the advent of universally televised/recorded games. I was surprised by how little moralizing Mathewson does in the book, I guess I thought he had a reputation for being a rectitudinal college dude, not to say sourpuss but anyway, I am not sure I needed to read this book and it is not especially insightful but as a baseball history nerd I still gleaned some moments of pleasure from its musty electronic pages."}, {"userName": "Grant", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5668751-grant", "userReview": "While some of the stories were interesting, funny, and gave insight into the early days of pro baseball, the book was very repetitive. Within the chapters, Mathewson's tales seemed to jump here and there too. It wasn't confusing, it was just like talking to a guy who keeps remembering something else in the middle of telling his tale and taking a detour from what he was saying.

A college-educated player from Pennsylvania farm country, he restored respectability to a game tarnished by the rowdies who had dominated baseball in the 1890s. Pitching\u00a0in a Pinch, originally published in 1912, is an insider\u2019s account blending anecdote, biography, instruction, and social history. It celebrates baseball as it was played in the first decade of the twentieth century by famous contemporaries like Honus Wagner and Rube Marquand, managers like John McGraw and Connie Mack, and many others. Always sensitive to psychology as well as technique, Mathewson describes the \u201cdangerous batters\u201d he faced, the \u201cpeculiarities\u201d of big-league pitchers, the \u201cgood and bad\u201d of coaching, umpiring, sign-stealing, base-running, spring training, and the importance of superstition to athletes.
