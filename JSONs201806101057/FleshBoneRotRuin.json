So if you liked those you'll probably like this one too. I very much enjoyed the first two books but found this one to be a little too of the same thing. About fifty or sixty percent of the way through it I just felt stalled. I felt like, \"Okay I've been here before can't you offer me anything new?\" Don't get me wrong, there was plenty of action and I still really enjoy the characters. It was just a bit too much of the same thing.Now once I pushed through that sixty percent mark things did get a bit better. A couple of new characters brought in some new aspects to the action and plot that I enjoyed. I hope the author carries these new characters forward into the next books in the series. I think it would be a really big improvement.Here at the end of book three, we're at an interesting turning point in the series plot. Right now, there are seven main books in the series and I'm very interested to see where things are going to go. Book three was my least favorite of the series so far but it really had a big effect on the overall plot of the series!Somewhat disappointed in book three but still looking forward to the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Shelby *trains flying monkeys*", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1053760-shelby-trains-flying-monkeys", "userReview": "This was more of a 4.5 star book.This series is fast becoming my favorite zombie series ever. Benny Imura in the first book Rot and Ruin was beyond childish. He has started growing on me in the last books and now I'm actually a fan of his. This book is very fast moving. With zoms/gray people/walkers every where. The virus is starting to mutate and I'm fascinated to see where Maberry goes with it.\nIn this book the four teenagers are still trying to find the jet that they saw fly over in book one. They end up coming across a religious cult that turned my blood cold. Mama Rose and Father John are some major sickos. Some people have downed this book saying they couldn't see this happening. Hello? Similar things have happened and we aren't even in a zombie apocolypse. \nThere was quite a bit of the zombie collector cards in the first book. The kids were younger and more naive then. They aren't mentioned as much in the other books but in this one there was mention of a Sheriff Rick card. I can't say how much I loved that."}, {"userName": "Kimmie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9349601-kimmie", "userReview": "Arrrrggghhhh, this book is so frustrating! I likedit, don't get me wrong, but it is my least favorite in all the books. Why, why, why, why did there have to be another group of wrong doers introduced into this series? Hasn't Chong had it hard enough as it is? Why the heck do they keep getting separated? Why are they always finding themselves deeper into trouble? I'm not sure frustrating even covers what I feel after reading this book. I did not like how it covered only one stinking day throughout the whole book, I don't like how they always are getting separated, I don't like how Chong almost always gets killed, and I loathed the whole darkness cult thing. Where the heck did that come from? I still liked this book, because it didn't lose the feel of the other two books, but it was just so exasperating and frustrating. I think I would have liked it better if they would have at least gotten through more than one day. It had been a month since Tom died and that was covered in less than a page, but a full out war against some nut job cult that lasted one day throughout a whole novel.

(Unless you don't care about spoilers\u2013\u2013in which case, go right ahead.)So, don't get me wrong ... I'm a big fan of this series. Especially as someone who doesn't delve much into the whole zombie/horror genre, I find this series to be impressing over all. They're well-written, they're exciting, there are some terrific characters and a lot of thought-provoking themes that I wouldn't typically expect from a zombie book.That said, I found this one to be a little disappointing. It wasn't bad, and I enjoyed reading it, but it just didn't blow me away in the same way the first two books did.Basically, the third book starts on a pretty grim note: Tom Imura is dead, leaving Benny, Nix, Lilah, and Chong to survive in the zombie-infested Rot & Ruin on their own. They're still searching for a plane like the one they once saw in the sky\u2013\u2013because a plane is a sign of civilization, and maybe even a safe place from the zoms. The only problem is, the zombies seem to be getting increasingly more intelligent. And the kids have other problems to face, like crazy cults and escaped zoo animals. Without Tom to guide them, they must all use what they've learned in order to survive. Well, I'll just get this out of the way first: I MISSED TOM.I mean, I know that was kind of the point. It was supposed to be painful. And honestly, throughout the first two books I just had a feeling all along that Tom would have to die. I mean, mentors always have to die in books don't they? Otherwise the main characters can never mature and learn to do things on their own, etc. BUT STILL. The thing is, Tom was my favorite character. He was just so badass and awesome, and ... guh, I just loved him so much, okay? I understand why Jonathan Maberry made the decision to kill him off, and the whole thing about Benny essentially wanting to replace Tom was intriguing ... but it still tore me to pieces and I really missed Tom just being there in the story. It didn't feel the same without him.But okay, okay. I tried to get over my love of Tom and still enjoy the plot without him. And for the most part, I did. There was some more interesting world-building: I like how, as the protagonists move into different areas, they see how people have different references/slang when it comes to talking about zombies, which makes sense. I also thought the addition of the cults was interesting (not to mention disturbing). The zoo animals felt a little far-fetched to me (I mean, they're in the U.S. and in an uncontrolled environment ... soooo wouldn't they die in the winter?), but at least their presence was ... entertaining, I guess.I just didn't feel quite as invested in the story in this book. It felt a little too ... focused to me. I can't think of a better way to describe it. It's like, I feel like the previous books were a bit more crazy. They had more of a \"wild adventure\" feel, where the characters were running all over the place, and there were bounty hunters, and there was Gameland, and it was all insane and awesome. This one was mostly just ... cults and scary zoo animals. And look, that stuff is crazy too and all, I just felt like it got a bit repetitive. While it was fun for the most part, there were chunks of it when I was just kinda like .... \"Mehhh.\"I know, I know. I'm so eloquent.Anyway. My other major problem is that ... I just don't like Benny and Nix, I realized. In my reviews for the previous books, I think I just said that I didn't really like them as a couple. But in this book, I started to also dislike them ... in general. As individuals. I think it had something to do with the fact that they were cut off from Chong and Lilah. And while Chong and Lilah's separate adventures were much more interesting, Benny and Nix were mostly kind of wandering around and being sad and discussing their relationship and whatnot. And the more frustrated I got with their storyline, the more I came to realize that I just don't find them to be particularly compelling characters. Previously I'd been like, \"I don't like Benny and Nix as a couple and I just can't figure out why ...\" But now I think the problem is that I just don't particularly care for either of them. On top of that, Nix was just really annoying sometimes. Like, Benny made some comment about Riot (who was awesome by the way) being kind of attractive, and Nix was like \"EEW I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU THINK THAT UGLY GIRL IS PRETTY, ARGH I BET YOU LIKE HER BENNY YOU TURD.\" And I'm like ... geez girl, what's wrong with you? It just got to the point where I could barely stand her anymore.So yeah ... basically it occurred to me that I really just care about Lilah and Chong. And I cared about Tom, but he's dead now ... so, DAMN IT. Oh, but I did really like the parts about Lilah and Chong. They were exciting. YAAAAAY.But anyway, just a few more miscellaneous things that bothered me (THERE WILL BE SPOILERS!!!!):- The whole thing with Benny's \"inner voice\" (and I don't mean Tom's ghost, although I'll get to that in a second). It's almost as bad as the \"inner goddess\" in Fifty Shades of Grey. And by that I mean, it's way too repetitive. I mean, I think these books are quite well-written for the most part, but the references to Benny's \"inner voice\" are just way too frequent. So yeah, that bugs me. I noticed this in the previous two books too, but I don't think I ever mentioned it in my reviews. So, yeah.- The chapters felt way too short sometimes. And I guess I noticed this in the other books, but it came to my attention more often in this one. Like, literally some of the chapters would be a paragraph long. And ... I just don't like that. Maybe it's a personal taste thing, but it just seems unnecessary to me. If a chapter is that short, just combine it with another chapter. Otherwise, I start having Maximum Ride flashbacks. *Shudders*- Oh yeah, Tom's ghost. Or, well, his ghostly voice apparently \"speaking\" in the characters' heads. I know it happened frequently to Benny and to Lilah also ... I can't remember if there was anyone else. But, I found it a bit confusing. I mean, I assumed that it was just in their imaginations or whatever, but then it was referred to so often that I was like, \"Wait ... What? Is Tom actually a ghost?\" And just ... I don't know. I understand that Tom was important to them, and that it was symbolic or something, but it felt a little silly at times to me. \"Silly\" seems like the wrong word, though. But ... that's the best I've got.- Lilah revealing that she'd been in love with Tom. ...... WHAT???!!! Was this addressed in previous books and I totally missed it ... ? Because if I recall correctly, she'd never really seemed to be interested in Tom that way. Or maybe I'm just really stupid and didn't pick up on it. But anyway, it seemed to come totally out of the blue. And ... I just found it kind of creepy. I mean, with the age difference ... just ... ugh. Also, it seemed uncharacteristic of her to me. So, that weirded me out.- The whole climatic scene at the end felt pretty anti-climatic, because basically Benny just got knocked out near the beginning and missed the whole thing. So then we as readers also had to miss out on it and didn't really get to \"see\" anything happen. And I was like \"NOOOOooo I want to see all the madness and mayhem!\" D: - And then, of course ... CHONG. WHAT. CHONG IS A ZOMBIE? WHAT THE EVERLOVING HELLLLL. Man, you should see all the notes I took on my Kindle while I read this. They're all like \"wut ... NOoo ... chooong ... DAFUQ .... FUCKKKK NOOOooo.\" So yeah. I was very upset. Seeing as he's one of the only two remaining characters that I actually like, I find this very sad. So ... I really hope somehow he doesn't like ... permanently die. I don't know. I JUST LOVE HIMMMMM AND ... NOOOOOoooo. ... Well, I suppose that's all I have to say. Yes, as you can see, there were some things that bothered me in this book. However, I did still find it exciting and thought-provoking as the previous two books had been. And of course, I shall eagerly await the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613919-jason", "userReview": "4.5 Stars\u201c\u201d\u2018He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster,\u2019\u201d\u201dFlesh and Bone, book 3 of the Benny Imura series was one of my most anticipated reads for 2012 by one of my favorite authors. I am not really that big into young adult fiction, but when an amazing horror author like Maberry puts a zombie series to life, it is sure one not to be missed. The story of the two brothers Benny and Tom through the first two books found many of the main plot lines closed up by book two\u2019s end, and a few more brought to life. This book picks up right after the end of the last. Without any series spoilers I will review the rest.I loved the action and the relationships that have been built up through books one and two, but in this one, we gain very little additional insight into our young heroes. A major plot point from book two paints much of the understory of this one, to the point where many other things are overshadowed. This was the worst thing for me to deal with as I really felt that it lessened the overall feel of the series. That being said, Benny, Nix, Lilah, and Chong all continue to grow up as young adults as the horrors around them mold them into the heroes that they are. Flesh and Bone has a few additional interesting characters added to the cast too. Saint John of the knife, Mother Rose, Joe, and my favorite, the zombie killing dog named Grimm.The foreword by Maberry is both poignant and pertinent to our story and I often thought back to his words that started this book. Loss, pain, and the way one deals with it are the major themes of this book, and each of our heroes has their own way.\u201cIt was why Lilah did not fear death. So many of the people she loved were waiting for her there.Lilah kept walking along the muddy bank of the stream, but she slowed and then stopped completely. The path ahead of her was invisible now. It was not hidden by shadows, and it had not petered out as loose soil gave way to hard rock. No, it was simply that Lilah couldn\u2019t see a thing through the hot tears that boiled from her eyes and burned their way down her cheeks.\u201dPossible spoiler ahead:\u201c\u201cWas it like this for you, Tom? he wondered. Was this what you felt when you carried me out of Sunset Hollow on First Night? If you were really the coward I used to think you were, you would have run off and left me. Wouldn\u2019t you? You would have saved yourself. Alone, without having to carry me, it would have been easier for you to slip away. But you didn\u2019t. You carried me all the way.Was it a memory? Or now that Benny stood at death\u2019s fragile door, was it easier for Tom\u2019s ghost to whisper to him from the darkness on the other side?Benny, whispered Tom, I didn\u2019t die to save you.\u201cI know that, Einstein,\u201d Benny growled back as he ran.No\u2014listen! I didn\u2019t die to save you.A zom fell into the ravine directly in front of them, and the little girl screamed even louder. But Benny leaped over the awkward form before the zom could struggle to its feet.I lived to save you, said Tom. I lived.\u201d\u201dThe pain and emotion and the emotionally touching scenes are all the best in this third book. There is less action and a smaller scope in this one, but that is ok too. Many of the Benny and Nix scenes are standouts, as well as the scenes involving the new character Joe and his kick ass dog Grimm. Chong however stole the show for me. The least warrior like of the bunch makes many incredibly difficult and brave decisions that show just what it means to be heroic. His interactions with Riot were fabulous.I have really enjoyed the adventures in this series so far, even though I was taken aback at the end of book two. Hopefully when the final book comes out I will not be feeling that things should have gone differently. This is a fantastic heartfelt young adult series that takes place in a post-apocalyptic land of the undead. It will be loved and enjoyed by readers of all ages. Jonathan Maberry is one of my very favorite authors of today, and one that should not be missed\u2026My highest recommendations!!!\u201c\u201c\u2018And when you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.\u2019\u201d\u201d"}, {"userName": "Brooke", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5018100-brooke", "userReview": "NOT AVAIL UNTIL SEPTEMBER!!!

They really can't come fast enough. Flesh & Bone continues the story of Benny and his friends while they navigate the rot and the ruin, encountering everything from a dangerous death cult to a mysterious haven known only as \"Sanctuary.\" Will it be everything they hope for?Maberry delivers on the thrills as well, with his typical \"impossible to escape\" scenarios as well as introducing evolutions (i.e. speed, better coordination) to the zoms that terrify both the characters and the reader.My main critisism of the book is that I felt like the book ended before the story did. Just as the overarching narrative begins to move forward..bam - end of book. This of course could just be my eagerness to find out what happens next, but this book did not seem quite as complete as the previous two. Ah well, it just means I'll be awaiting the fate of our heroes even more enthusiastically.SPOILER: Also, fans of other Maberry works will be delighted to meet Captain Joe Ledger in this book.

The second book, Dust & Decay, was amazing, but the ending left me heartbroken and I was left unsure if that ending was good for the story. Now Flesh & Bone, the third book in the series, is my least favorite, but I still overall enjoyed it.\nTHE GOOD.\n~Chong: There is some major character development on Chong's part. I feel like we actually get to know him in this book and watch him grow. Don't get me wrong, in the first two books he was an awesome hilarious character, but in this one, he gets even more amazing. We actually get to know the real him. I think he's now my favorite character in this books. Loved his intelligence, humor, and seeing the things he would do for people he cares for.~Lilah: Ah, I've loved her from the start, but now we actually get to know the real her as well. She's badass, and independent. One of the best female characters in the YA genre.~The Writing: I love the writing! Its full of rich descriptions and I love the multiple POVs, that way we get into the main characters' heads. It's absolutely fantastic!~The Plot/Storyline: This one had a lottt going on with the plot once you got past the slow beginning , and usually books with a lot going on are hard to understand, but Jonathan Maberry pulled it off well! Once I got past the slow beginning, this book was like BAM!! I was totally hooked!~The Ending/Epilogue: DAMN! So crazy!! So excited for the next book!! And damn, that epilogue brought back memories from the first two books! Gah, LOVED it!!\nTHE BAD.\n~Benny: I don't know...he's just so annoying and I can't relate to his character. He's just bland, I suppose.~Nix: She's so freaking annoying!! She thinks that no one has been through want she has, and she whines all the time. Like, seriously, shut up, Nix!~The Romance: I never liked Benny and Nix as a couple, but it wasn't so bad that I couldn't deal with it...Now it is. They have stupid problems/arguements. And they're both annoying. So its just like, gosh, stop! I cannot deal with them together.\nOVERALL.\nDespite the fact that I had some big problems with the main character and his girlfriend, I still overall liked this book and do recommend it if you're a fan of the first two books. And if you haven't read the first book, Rot & Ruin, then read it soon! It'll completely change your view on zombies (in a good way). It's definitely an emotional, funny, and exciting book with twists you'll never see coming!Tom gave an elaborate shrug. \"How would I know, little brother? You're the hero with the magic sword.

So many of the people she loved were waiting for her there\"\n - Flesh and BoneI liked this book BUT Kind of annoyed at how many times Benny says sorry to the zombies he kills. I'm \nCanadian\n and even I think this is getting to be too much. He is becoming way too deferential to these zombies and my eyes are getting exhausted from all the rolling.And another thing, while I'm on a tangent and all, what the hell is up with Chong? He is the Lorrie of this book ( if you watch the walking dead you will understand), all he does is endanger people, the world is dangerous enough without him adding to it! I understand that not everybody is cut out for the rot and ruin but he is just plain reckless and that is not so easily forgivable. I think in a town setting he would be great and useful and make a big difference but out in the wild I just hate him. Then I feel bad for hating him because I certainly wouldn't last a day in the rot and ruin, but still why does he have to be so annoying?Also,Nix has turned into a massive bitch, buuuut I feel like I can't really blame anyone for being a bitch in the zombie apocalypse. Her harshness towards Benny is pretty cringe worthy though.Now after all that griping you might think I hate this book. I don't. In fact I quite liked it, I think my issue is more with the pace/direction of some of the characters than with the quality of writing which is still just as high as the previous two. I was quite impressed with how the author winds in new characters in a natural yet interesting way. Overall this was an enjoyable read and if you can get past some overly clumsy/bitchy characters I think that you will really enjoy this. 3.5/5"}, {"userName": "Mauoijenn ~ *Mouthy Jenn* ~", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2569271-mauoijenn-mouthy-jenn", "userReview": "Another great book in this awesome series!!

The story picks up a month after the devastating events of Rot & Ruin. Benny Imura, Nix Riley, Lilah the Lost Girl and Lou Chong are still searching for the mysterious plane they saw while trying to come to terms with Tom\u2019s shocking loss. They have left California behind, and are now in Nevada where Nix and Benny are having issues with their relationship and Lilah is coming to terms with her feelings for Chong. Things in the Ruin are also quickly changing. It appears that the zombies are getting faster and have a general understanding of what is happening around them while animals are now appearing as infected and causing problems for the group. I have not read the novella Dead & Gone before picking up Flesh Bone. I probably should have and may do so sometime in the near future since many new characters appear and make an immediate impact on Benny & Crew. Maberry introduces readers to Riot, Eve and her family, as well an organization called the Night Church and its psychotic leader Saint John of the knives who is just plain evil in every way imaginable.There\u2019s also Mother Rose who leads a group known as Reapers who follow the doctrine of the Night Church and the god Thanatos by crossing the country killing everyone who refuses to join their crusade. Mother Rose also has a few choice secrets of her own that slowly unravel as the story reaches its pinnacle.Not everything is dark and dreary or foreboding this time out. We have the arrival of Captain Joe Ledger of the Rangers and his zombie killing dog Grimm to the story. Fans of \u201cPatient Zero\u201d will immediately recognize who Captain Ledger is. I must say that Joe\u2019s arrival was a pleasant surprise and one that I hope continues over the course of the next installment. There is a definite past between Joe and Saint John that I would love to see played out in this series.We\u2019re also discovering that the world didn\u2019t exactly end on FIRST NIGHT as most believed when Benny and Nix discover all sorts of interesting things. They also learn that there is a place called Sanctuary run by the Children of God Monks and it appears that a new American nation is attempting to rise up out of the ashes left by the destruction of FIRST NIGHT.Flesh & Bone is action packed and emotional right from the onset as Benny and crew are forced to fight against not only zombies, but the Reapers and infected animals as well. I\u2019m happy to say that Maberry has once again written an outstanding novel that has everything I expect from a horror/dystopian novel. I\u2019m definitely looking forward to reading Fire and Ash when it releases September 26th 2013."}, {"userName": "Christy LoveOfBooks", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1390723-christy-loveofbooks", "userReview": "I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s over! Flesh & Bone went by way too fast. This series is one of my most favorites, and one of the few I read as soon as the books are released. I know it seems like my blog is becoming a Jonathan Maberry fan page lately, but the man has an amazing gift for writing that I can\u2019t get enough of.Flesh & Bone picks up about a month after Benny, Nix, Lilah, and Chong disembarked on their journey east. Leaving the only home they\u2019ve known in the Central California mountains behind, in search of the mystery jet. The book is action packed right from the start. Their skills are put to the test, not only physically, but intellectually, as well. Of course, Maberry has to make me cry at least once in these books, so get your tissue ready.Benny, Nix, Lilah, and Chong were great as always. Nix and Lilah are fierce, and anyone should think twice when crossing them. I love those girls so much, especially Lilah. She\u2019s truly one tough chick, yet she really does want the love she\u2019s only read about in books. And I love how everyone is so confident in her abilities. Sometimes I felt a little sorry for Benny and Chong, because I know it can be tough with not only one, but two dominant females. Mostly, though, it made me laugh. Chong especially made me laugh, with all of his smart-ass remarks.There are new monsters in Flesh & Bone, and I don\u2019t mean the zombies. The Night Church is making their way across the country, killing everyone who doesn\u2019t join them. It\u2019s a good idea to read the novella Dead & Gone prior to starting this book. It\u2019s not necessary, but it\u2019s a lot nicer to have some background on Riot and the Night Church. Riot has ties to the Night Church, but wants nothing to do with them. I don\u2019t blame her, because they psycho! It gets very ugly when it all come to a head in Nevada, with Benny and the gang right in the mix.Those who are fans of Maberry\u2019s Joe Ledger series are in for quite a treat! Prior to the release of Flesh & Bone, I saw on Maberry\u2019s facebook that Ledger would make a cameo, so I thought it would be something small, like just a mention in passing. Wrong, there is a lot of him! I was beyond giddy. The way he was incorporated into the story was brilliant! There were a few other references that I found humorous, too.Overall, Flesh & Bone is a great addition to an amazing series. I highly recommend this series, even to people who aren\u2019t into zombies. I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on the fourth and final book, Fire & Ash, due out in 2013."}, {"userName": "Sue Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith", "userReview": "This book is not an easy book to review. Why?, you ask. Well, I'll tell you ... but forgive me if I meander like a zombie after a bite to eat .... I want to give the story justice!Firstly, let me assure you that it's a great book. I do love how Jonathan Maberry makes the existence of zombies a frighteningly realistic thing, with a human element that just adds to the horror of it. And this particular chapter into the 'adventure' of a group of young friends really brings that to light even more so. I don't think I'd like to see this happen to the world. It truly would be a scary place to be, especially because the craziness and extremisms would be such an easy thing to visualize happening. Peace and keeping it are always on a fine balancing wire together.What makes this book so much different from the first two of the series is that it loses the \u2018youth\u2019 factor in it. It\u2019s a sadder book and the a lot more heavy. The comedic sarcasm that was so prominent in the lead character(s) is still there, only you really feel how flat it falls in the denseness of the tragedy of the life \u2013or what\u2019s left of it \u2013 that they find themselves a part of. In truth, these kids grow up fast because they have to but not because it\u2019s easy to do, or wanted. They all long for something they can no longer have and they all have to continue on with life, and those don\u2019t always mix as easily as it did before. It\u2019s that old adage that you don\u2019t really know what you got until you don\u2019t have it anymore. And this new heaviness that the previous two books had in short supply, nearly dropped my rating to three stars. I missed the levity to offshoot the tragedy I suppose. It\u2019s hard to give it full marks when it\u2019s so different feeling from the first two, but I don\u2019t think it lacked merit.Oh \u2013 did I mention that there are zombies in this book? Sheesh \u2026 do I really have to?! Of course there are zombies in this book!! Only there\u2019s an added element to the horror of a zombie plague that makes them beyond horrible. (Where Jonathan Maberry gets his ideas is beyond me). Let\u2019s just say that it\u2019s a mutation of a zombie genetic mutation that would really put a strain on the remaining live people that are left to face them and survive without succumbing to it. Lordy I\u2019m glad we don\u2019t really have to deal with zombies.Great book! Can\u2019t wait for the finale."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7788355-karen", "userReview": "I just finished rereading this remarkable book but this time on audio, which I highly recommend! Just as good the second time around!Here is my original review:Another fantastic non-stop action book in the The Rot & Ruin Collection: Rot & Ruin; Dust & Decay; Dead & Gone; Flesh & Bone series! For the first time ever, I actually tried to slow down my reading because I knew that once I finished, the book would be over. I never want this series to end.The new evil doers were everything I hate and more. There were many times where I was cringing and absolutely stunned by what Benny, Nix, Chong and Lilah were dealing with this time around. And why oh why do I continue to read this series while out at the local coffee shops? Again, I had to hide my face behind my Nook while the tears were rolling down my cheeks. I should know better by now. I feel so vested in these characters and their world. Once again, WELL DONE, Mr. Maberry! Well done!

They still traverse the Rot and Ruin towards the unknown, but their hope stays strong. The world is a wild place now. Exotic animals hunt them. Zombies attack them in swarms and not just slow, normal zombies, but faster, evolving zombies. A death cult grows large and picks off towns and villages one by one, leaving a wake of blood and death. A small band of survivors try to fight back, but the odds don't look good. Benny and his friends must remain constantly vigilant that everything in the Rot and Ruin willy try to kill them in order to survive.Flesh and Bone is the third in the series and it's going very strong. Benny and his friends are in emotional shambles at this point because of Tom's death. Benny is acting recklessly to prove to a disembodied Tom in his head that he can be the samurai he was taught to be. Nix is distant and lost in her own thoughts much of the time, making her relationship with Benny strained even further. Nix's journal is interspersed in between the chapters, giving insight to her emotions and thoughts that she keeps from the others. Her journey to find the airplane means more to her than the others know. Lilah and Chong are both suffering from the loss, but maintain more of who they were before. Through most of the novel, these characters are separated and each go through their own struggles. I enjoyed seeing the story from each character's point of view and I especially liked the insight into Lilah who has a weakness for classic romantic literature underneath her steely exterior.A new Big Bad is introduced in this novel: the Night Church. They are a fanatical death cult that see survivors as an affront to God's will because the zombies were created to destroy the human race. The cult feels it's their duty to \"open red doors\" in people and release them into the bliss of death. These people are incredibly frightening because of their stalwart faith that what they are doing is right. Saint John of the Knife is the most zealous and frightening of the bunch, thinking of bigger and more effective ways to accomplish their goal. The leader of the cult is Mother Rose, who doesn't believe in the dogma at all and uses the cult to gain power and eliminate the opposition. These two main villains are incredibly dangerous in their own way and are the best of the series so far. Their dynamic together is interesting and you wonder who is really fooling who in the situation and when they will find out the truth about each other. Flesh and Bone has character development, super creepy villains, and, of course, zombies. Interesting things happen with these zombies that I never saw coming. The zombies still have a huge presence in the novel and become even more frightening than before. Paired with the human villains, the odds against our heroes are astronomically high. I can't wait to read the final book in the series, Fire and Ash."}, {"userName": "Christina (Ensconced in Lit)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3854740-christina-ensconced-in-lit", "userReview": "I'm a big fan of the previous two books in this quartet. The first, Rot and Ruin, was probably my favorite read of the year. The second, was almost as strong, and ended with heartbreak that I had to deal with for a few weeks before picking up the third. This installment is my least favorite of the three for a few reasons, but definitely worth reading, and thoughtful in its own way.Flesh and Bone is the third out of four books by Jonathan Maberry about the zombie apocalypse that has fallen on the world. Benny, Chong, the Lost Girl, and Nix are struggling to survive in the Rot and Ruin after still reeling from deaths of loved ones. They encounter more evil than they thought possible-- a group of Reapers whose sole purpose is to have everyone join the Gray Walkers that abound the earth. New characters are introduced (including a terrifying Big Bad), and the mystery of the plane is solved.What I Loved: The development of Chong was probably my favorite part of the book. He's come so far and his relationship with the Lost Girl is very sweet. This makes the ending that much more poignant. Also, we get the introduction of a new cult, which is terrifying in its sway in this awful world. I can imagine people giving up and joining a cult to end the human race. We see this kind of depression in medicine all the time-- and I can't imagine if the world was actually as bad as people saw it, what that would do to the human psyche. Maberry is terrific at coming up with new ethical dilemmas, and he is very thoughtful in his dealings with them.What I wasn't as thrilled about: I know my reaction to this book is a little bit like my reaction to Harry Potter book 5. It was a must read, but because of how annoying adolescent Harry was, it was my least favorite. I had the same reaction to Nix-- so many times in the book, I just wanted to shake her. She exhibited all the worst characteristics of female communication (i.e. men need to just know what we are thinking), and was a complete brat to Benny for most of the book. Also, the first half of the book was more of the characters just wandering around in the Rot and Ruin, and seemed like just filler for the last 25%, which was non-stop action and intrigue to the end. That said, there is no doubt that I'm following this to the end and cannot wait to pick up the fourth and final installment of this series, which is probably the best set of books I've read this year."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4404986-maria", "userReview": "I recommend Flesh and Bone....after reading this third book in the series, I'm not sure if there's a happy ending for Benny Imura. and that kinda sucks.I would've finished this sooner if I didn't lose my Kindle last December. *sadness* Anyway, I'm not that quite elated when I finished Flesh and Bone. Sure there's still gore, fanaticism, and heartbreak. But the characters are aggravating, and add to that, that their situation seemed to be stuck at perpetual bad luck, I was crestfallen.Well, I did like Benny's bizarre conversations with his brother, Tom. It was fitting. I understood Benny's 'craziness'. What I did not get was Nix. Man, I was so put out by her misplaced touchiness. Was she the only person who lost someone?!! Benny has more right to grieve and yet, he always end up consoling her. So not cool, Nix.Lila and Chong are the biggest surprises of Flesh and Bone. Her POV was intense, while his was... funny, but aching with worry and regret. I felt so lost with those two, as they are lost in their unbounded feelings for each other. Now I'm wishing zombies doesn't exist in Rot & Ruin. It doesn't have to be so tragic! :(A new villain has come out and he's more creepy and dangerous than the previous bad guys. There is always something menacing for idealists and fanatics. *goosebumps* But there also new allies that warmed my already desolate heart.Snarky humor and amazing action scenes are ever present, and there never was a dull moment with Benny Imura and his friends. I need more hope though. Seems to me too much despair and anguish has been thrown their way in Flesh and Bone. Now I'm thinking too, that maybe there's nothing good to live for anymore in Benny's world."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/477874-heather", "userReview": "Benny, Nix, Chong, and Lilah have healed physically, but they're still mentally recovering from the horrific events they suffered at the end of \"Dust and Decay.\" They've lost loved ones and seen human beings do terrible things that forever changed the way they look at the world. Now Benny and his friends are on their own, headed east through the Rot and Ruin in search of the plane they saw flying in that direction months ago. And things get only more dangerous as they go. It appears that the zombies are changing. Some are faster and even seem smarter than any seen before. Has the plague mutated, or is a more sinister force behind this development? Before the group can figure it out, they come across a strange religious cult with a so-called holy mission of killing people to send them into the sacred Darkness. Benny and the others have gotten out of scrapes before, but this takes it to a whole other level. I can't get enough of the Benny Imura series. It has non-stop action, but there's a lot of depth to the stories as well. You really get to know and love the characters. They grow up a lot in this installment, and I like that--it bugs me when characters stay the same throughout a book and especially a series. There are a few moments that are a bit cheesy, but for the most part the characters, their emotions, and their reactions feel incredibly real. \"Flesh and Bone,\" like the previous titles in the series, not only entertains but also provides a lot of food for thought about standing up for what's right and having hope when all seems lost. Oh, and as a final thought, I have to mention that I LOVE the unexpected appearance of a crazy-cool character from one of Maberry's other series. I literally cheered when I figured out who he is (yes, I am that nerdy).
