(koff Rooftoppers koff)but i do think that it's a good book for its intended audience. it touches upon real issues like OCD and anxiety and what happens to the family dynamic when confronted with a newborn who is very sick, and how to be a good big brother, and bravery and ingenuity in terrifying situations and all that good stuff. it's about the temptation of the easy path and how sometimes struggle is better than that quick fix. it's got a solid, character-building message and enough action and horror to hold even a reluctant reader's attention. it also has nicely understated illustrations by john klassen. there's something that so perfectly evokes quiet, exhausted despair in this simple image.\n in a way, it reads like a little-brother piece to A Monster Calls. it doesn't have the same emotional depth or lyricism, but there are similarities in its juxtaposition of dark supernatural elements against illness and grief. plus - drawings.i think kids, particularly boys, will get more out of this than i did, so i would definitely recommend it for the MG crowd, but since this is my review about my own personal response, all i can say is that it didn't transcend into grown-up territory the way other MG books have. for me. also - this is probably a bad idea:"}, {"userName": "Regan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19645927-regan", "userReview": "a very interesting and weird tale"}, {"userName": "Melki", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki", "userReview": "\"People lie and say they don't want perfect.

Y no me ha dejado indiferente.El nido es de esos libros que transcienden, que apelan a nuestros sentimientos y los retuercen. Es una historia dura, apta para lectores de cualquier edad, pues cada uno sacar\u00e1 una lectura diferente. Se mezclan elementos emotivos, valores de familia, al igual que un continuo sentimiento tenebroso que acompa\u00f1a la novela desde el primer momento (y que se ve acentuado con las ilustraciones).Me ha parecido un libro incre\u00edble. De verdad, de estos que no te dejan igual. Es mejor ir sin saber de lo que trata. Te sorprende much\u00edsimo ver c\u00f3mo se va desenvolviendo la historia, y adem\u00e1s hay algunas tramas que no me esperaba para nada. Los giros en la trama que tienen son de estos que te dejan el culo torcido, en plan QU\u00c9 NARICES EST\u00c1 PASANDO Y POR QU\u00c9 TENGO LOS PELOS DE TODO EL CUERPO DE PUNTA.No quiero dar muchos detalles de lo que viene siendo la novela (ni en cuanto a estructura, ni a evoluci\u00f3n de la trama, ni nada de eso), porque creo que en conjunto funciona muy bien en cuanto a sorprender al lector. Solo dir\u00e9 que no se ha llevado las cinco estrellas porque me ha faltado algo en el final, quiz\u00e1 lo comente en un v\u00eddeo.Sin duda alguna El nido es una novela que recomiendo sin lugar a dudas. Qu\u00e9 maravilla no solo c\u00f3mo est\u00e1 escrita, sino el tema que trata y c\u00f3mo lo trata, los personajes y la din\u00e1mica que estos tienen, y en general, la ambientaci\u00f3n e inestabilidad que se transmite.

It\u2019s a very specific breed of book, you know. Most people on the street might think of the Goosebumps books or similar ilk when they think of horror stories for the 10-year-old set, but that\u2019s just a small portion of what turns out to be a much greater, grander set of stories. Children\u2019s book horror takes on so many different forms. You have your post-apocalyptic, claustrophobic horrors, like  Z for Zachariah by Robert C. O'Brien. You have your everyday-playthings-turned-evil tales like Doll Bones by Holly Black. You have your close family members turned evil stories ala  Coraline by Neil Gaiman and  Wait Till Helen Comes by Mary Downing Hahn. And then there are the horror stories that shoot for the moon. The ones that aren\u2019t afraid (no pun intended) to push the envelope a little. To lure you into a false sense of security before they unleash some true psychological scares. And the best ones are the ones that tie that horror into something larger than themselves. In Kenneth Oppel\u2019s The Nest, the author approaches us with a very simple idea. What if your desire to make everything better, everyone happier, released an unimaginable horror? What do you do?New babies are often cause for true celebration, but once in a while there are problems. Problems that render parents exhausted and helpless. Problems with the baby that go deep below the surface and touch every part of your life. For Steve, it feels like it\u2019s been a long time since his family was happy. So when the angels appear in his dream offering to help with the baby, he welcomes them. True, they don\u2019t say much specifically about what they can do. Not at the beginning, but why look a gift horse in the mouth? Anyway, there are other problems in Steve\u2019s life as well. He may have to go back into therapy, and then there are these wasps building a nest on his house when he\u2019s severely allergic to them. A fixed baby could be the answer to his prayers. Only, the creatures visiting him don\u2019t appear to be angels anymore. And when it comes to \u201cfixing\u201d the baby . . . well, they may have other ideas entirely . . .First and foremost, I don\u2019t think I can actually talk about this book without dusting off the old \u201cspoiler alert\u201d sign. For me, the very fact that Oppel\u2019s book is so beautifully succinct and restrained, renders it impossible not to talk about its various (and variegated) twists and turns. So I\u2019m going to give pretty much everything away in this review. It\u2019s a no holds barred approach, when you get right down to it. Starting with the angels of course. They\u2019re wasps. And it only gets better from there.It comes to this. I\u2019ve no evidence to support this theory of mine as to one of the inspirations for the book. I\u2019ve read no interviews with Oppel about where he gets his ideas. No articles on his thought processes. But part of the reason I like the man so much probably has to do with the fact that at some point in his life he must have been walking down the street, or the path, or the trail, and saw a wasp\u2019s nest. And this man must have looked up at it, in all its paper-thin malice, and found himself with the following inescapable thought: \u201cI bet you could fit a baby in there.\u201d And I say unto you, it takes a mind like that to write a book like this.Wasps are perhaps nature\u2019s most impressive bullies. They seem to have been given such horrid advantages. Not only do they have terrible tempers and nasty dispositions, not only do they swarm, but unlike the comparatively sweet honeybee they can sting you multiple times and never die. It\u2019s little wonder that they\u2019re magnificent baddies in The Nest. The only question I have is why no one has until now realized how fabulous a foe they can be. Klassen\u2019s queen is particularly perfect. It would have been all too easy for him to imbue her with a kind of White Witch austerity. Queens come built-in with sneers, after all. This queen, however, derives her power by being the ultimate confident. She\u2019s sympathetic. She\u2019s patient. She\u2019s a mother who hears your concerns and allays them. Trouble is, you can\u2019t trust her an inch and underneath that friendliness is a cold cruel agenda. She is, in short, my favorite baddie of the year. I didn\u2019t like wasps to begin with. Now I abhor them with a deep inner dread usually reserved for childhood fears.I mentioned earlier that the horror in this book comes from the idea that Steve\u2019s attempts to make everything better, and his parents happier, instead cause him to consider committing an atrocity. In a moment of stress Steve gives his approval to the unthinkable and when he tries to rescind it he\u2019s told that the matter is out of his hands. Kids screw up all the time and if they\u2019re unlucky they screw up in such a way that their actions have consequences too big for their small lives. The guilt and horror they sometimes swallow can mark them for life. The queen of this story offers something we all can understand. A chance to \u201cfix\u201d everything and make the world perfect. Never mind that perfect doesn\u2019t really exist. Never mind that the price she exacts is too high. If she came calling on you, offering to fix that one truly terrible thing in your life, wouldn\u2019t you say yes? On the surface, child readers will probably react most strongly to the more obvious horror elements to this story. The toy telephone with the scratchy voice that sounds like \u201ca piece of metal being held against a grindstone.\u201d The perfect baby ready to be \u201cborn\u201d The attic . . . *shudder* Oh, the attic. But it\u2019s the deeper themes that will make their mark on them. And on anyone reading to them as well.There are books where the child protagonist\u2019s physical or mental challenges are named and identified and there are books where it\u2019s left up to the reader to determine the degree to which the child is or is not on such a spectrum. A book like Wonder by R.J. Palacio or  Out of My Mind by Sharon Draper will name the disability. A book like Emma-Jean Lazarus Fell Out of a Tree by Lauren Tarshis or  Counting by Sevens by Holly Sloan won\u2019t. There's no right or wrong way to write such books, and in The Nest Klassen finds himself far more in the latter rather than former camp. Steve has had therapy in the past, and exhibits what could be construed to be obsessive compulsive behavior. What\u2019s remarkable is that Klassen then weaves Steve\u2019s actions into the book\u2019s greater narrative. It becomes our hero\u2019s driving force, this fight against impotence. All kids strive to have more control over their own lives, after all. Steve's O.C.D. (though it is never defined in that way) is part of his helpless attempt to make things better, even if it\u2019s just through the recitation of lists and names. At one point he repeats the word \u201ccongenital\u201d and feels better, \u201cAs if knowing the names of things meant I had some power over them.\u201dWhen I was a young adult (not a teen) I was quite enamored of A.S. Byatt\u2019s book  Angels and Insects. It still remains one of my favorites and though I seem to have transferred my love of Byatt\u2019s prose to the works of Laura Amy Schlitz (her juvenile contemporary and, I would argue, equivalent) there are elements of Byatt\u2019s book in what Klassen has done here. His inclusion of religion isn\u2019t a real touchstone of the novel, but it\u2019s just a bit too prevalent to ignore. There is, for example, the opening line: \u201cThe first time I saw them, I thought they were angels.\u201d Followed not too long after by a section where Steve reads off every night the list of people he wants to keep safe. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know who I was asking. Maybe it was God, but I didn\u2019t really believe in God, so this wasn\u2019t praying exactly.\u201d He doesn\u2019t question the angels of his dreams or their desire to help (at least initially). And God makes no personal appearance in the novel, directly or otherwise. Really, when all was said and done, my overall impression was that the book reminded me of David Almond\u2019s  Skellig with its angel/not angel, sick baby, and boy looking for answers where there are few to find. The difference being, of course, the fact that in Skellig the baby gets better and here the baby is saved but it is clear as crystal to even the most optimistic reader that it will never ever been the perfect baby every parent wishes for.It\u2019s funny that I can say so much without mentioning the language, but there you go. Oppel\u2019s been wowing folks with his prose for years, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy a cunning turn of phrase when you encounter it. Consider some of his lines. The knife guy is described like \u201cHe looked like his bones were meant for an even bigger body.\u201d A description of a liquid trap for wasps is said to be akin to a, \u201csoggy mass grave, the few survivors clambering over the dead bodies, trying in vain to climb out. It was like a vision of hell from that old painting I\u2019d seen in the art gallery and never forgotten.\u201d Or what may well be my favorite in the book, \u201c... and they were regurgitating matter from their mouths and sculpting it into baby flesh.\u201d And then there are the little elements the drive the story. We don\u2019t learn the baby\u2019s name until page 112. Or the very title itself. When Vanessa, Steve\u2019s babysitter, is discussing nests she points out that humans make them as well. \u201cOur houses are just big nests, really. A place where you can sleep and be safe \u2013 and grow.\u201dThe choice of Jon Klassen as illustrator is fascinating to me. When I think of horror illustrations for kids the usual suspects are your Stephen Gammells or Gris Grimleys or Dave McKeans. Klassen\u2019s different. When you hire him, you\u2019re not asking him to ratchet up the fear factor, but rather to echo it and then take it down a notch to a place where a child reader can be safe. Take, for example, his work on Lemony Snicket\u2019s The Dark A book where the very shadows speak, it wasn\u2019t that Klassen was denying the creepier elements of the tale. But he tamed them somehow. And now that same taming sense is at work here. His pictures are rife with shadows and faceless adults, turned away or hidden from the viewer (and the viewer is clearly Steve/you). And his pictures do convey the tone of the book well. A curved knife on a porch is still a curved knife on a porch. Spend a little time flipping between the front and back endpapers, while you\u2019re at it. Klassen so subtle with these. The moon moves. A single light is out in a house. But there\u2019s a feeling of peace to the last picture, and a feeling of foreboding in the first. They\u2019re practically identical so I don\u2019t know how he managed that, but there it is. Honestly, you couldn\u2019t have picked a better illustrator.Suffice to say, this book would probably be the greatest class readaloud for fourth, fifth, or sixth graders the world has ever seen. When I was in fourth grade my teacher read us  The Wicked Wicked Pigeon Ladies in the Garden by Mary Chase and I was never quite the same again. Thus do I bless some poor beleaguered child with the magnificent nightmares that will come with this book. Added Bonus for Teachers: You\u2019ll never have to worry about school attendance ever again. There's not a chapter here a kid would want to miss.If I have a bone to pick with the author it is this: He\u2019s Canadian. Normally, this is a good thing. Canadians are awesome. They give us a big old chunk of great literature every year. But Oppel as a Canadian is terribly awkward because if he were not and lived in, say, Savannah or something, then he could win some major American children\u2019s literary awards with this book. And now he can\u2019t. There are remarkably few awards the U.S. can grant this tale of flying creepy crawlies. Certainly he should (if there is any justice in the universe) be a shoo-in for Canada\u2019s Governor General's Award in the youth category and I\u2019m pulling for him in the E.B. White Readaloud Award category as well, but otherwise I\u2019m out to sea. Would that he had a home in Pasadena. Alas.Children\u2019s books come with lessons pre-installed for their young readers. Since we\u2019re dealing with people who are coming up in the world and need some guidance, the messages tend towards the innocuous. Be yourself. Don\u2019t judge a book by its cover. Friendship is important. Etc. The message behind The Nest could be debated ad nauseam for quite some time, but I think the thing to truly remember here is something Steve says near the end. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no such thing as normal anyways.\u201d The belief in normality and perfection may be the truest villain in The Nest when you come right down to it. And Klassen has Steve try to figure out why it\u2019s good to try to be normal if there is no true normal in the end. It\u2019s a lesson adults have yet to master ourselves. Little wonder that The Nest ends up being what may be the most fascinating horror story written for kids you\u2019ve yet to encounter. Smart as a whip with an edge to the terror you\u2019re bound to appreciate, this is a truly great, truly scary, truly wonderful novel.

Y con esto no quiero decir que sea una historia de miedo como tal, creo que depende mucho de la edad con la que sea le\u00edda; supongo que un ni\u00f1o de 12 a\u00f1os vivir\u00e1 la historia de manera diferente a lo que yo la he vivido.Y no me olvido de las ilustraciones que acompa\u00f1an la historia; son igual de inquietantes.En resumen, El nido es una historia inquietante donde nada de lo que ocurre es normal, pero que te sorprender\u00e1 mucho y no podr\u00e1s parar de leer."}, {"userName": "Liviania", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1430644-liviania", "userReview": "Kenneth Oppel and Jon Klassen are both titans of children's literature. Their first collaboration is a creepy confection sure to delight fans of CORALINE. I hate to make the same comparison as the marketing, but this is one of those cases where it is true.Steve's baby brother is sick. It is a congenital problem, and he needs surgery, and he might not ever be completely normal. That's when Steve first dreams about the angels, the wasps, who offer to help. At first it seems like his dreams might just be a sensitive boy dealing with a tough time, experiencing his family's stress the only way he can. But the dreams are getting more sinister, and Steve is starting to suspect that he shouldn't have agreed to let the wasp queen help. Of course, no adults will believe him that they need to protect the baby from the wasps.Klassen's art is a terrific accompaniment to the story. In black and white his distinctive style looks quite sinister. It's startling white shapes on black backgrounds and shadows on shadows. Although the illustrations look quite simple, each enhances the mood of the text.Oppel's writing is in fine form. The text is rather large on the page, so THE NEST is even shorter than it seems. The words are as deceptively simple as the illustrations. Even a slower reader probably won't take to long to get through THE NEST, excepting for breaks to slow the creepy-crawlies. As short as the story is, it's the kind that burrows into you and makes you look at the world around you in a different way, as everyday things become sinister. It's also a well done portrait of childhood anxieties, both normal kid fears and trying to understand the fears of your parents which you can sense even when they try to hide them.I expect this scary story will become a new children's classic. If it doesn't, that's a true shame."}, {"userName": "Julia Sapphire", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39705390-julia-sapphire", "userReview": "3.5 ish TW: anxiety and OCD I wrote a very thought-out review and it got deleted so I'm bitter and not rewriting it:)"}, {"userName": "Irene", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23246203-irene", "userReview": "First of all, this book is terrifying. If I had read it when I was twelve I would probably have been scarred for life, and I would never have felt safe around wasps ever again. The fact that The Nest was extremely disquieting was not really a problem, I actually liked that about the book, but all of the suspense fell short in the end. It is unclear whether the main character, Steve, has a mental illness or not, which I liked in the beginning, but that ambivalence flattened out the ending. There was no commitment to one angle or another, and the wrap up was unsatisfying to me. That being said, it was hard to put the book down. It's engaging in a can't-look-away-from-the-horror sort of way. I would have a hard time recommending it to younger kids, unless they had a high tolerance for emotional distress. But it was entertaining.And the illustrations are GORGEOUS! I loved the layout of the book. The illustrations enhanced and in no way took away from the book.

The story starts out somewhat seemingly normal. Steven, a tween aged boy has to deal with his anxieties, his OCD, and his family drama. His newborn brother Theo, was born with some congestive disorders and the doctors are very concerned with his prognosis. As his parents and baby brother frequently travel to and from the hospital, Steven is forced to grow up rather quickly, often overseeing the care his younger sister. Along the way, things take a very dark and twisted turn. There is a man who drives a knife truck roaming up and down the street like some sort of freaky ice cream vender, a large nest of white colored wasps that no one can identify, start to build a nest outside Steven's home, and Steven's dreams of angels and shadowy figures start to become all too real. This book is marketed for kids grades 3-7 but there is no way I would recommend it for anyone under 12, at least. I loved this book. It was spooky and scary and extremely descriptive but not for elementary aged kids."}, {"userName": "Rashika (is tired)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8492956-rashika-is-tired", "userReview": "***This review has also been posted on The Social Potato\nWarning: this book contains scary bugs.If you know me, you know I hate bugs.\u00a0 I am a scardy-cat and *will* hide in my room in the presence of one. Why did I read the book then you ask? Because KENNETH OPPEL, goddamnit! I adored the Airborn series as a kid so I decided I wanted to read more books by Oppel, and here we are. I am so glad I read this book in spite of my fear of bugs because it is so well written and so adorable and filled with many wonderful messages.Steve is wonderfully characterized. He is an anxious kid (and probably suffers from a disorder that was not mentioned by the author) and has a tendency to overthink. Things change when his parents have a baby with several complications. Now most of their time is spent running back and forth from the hospital and taking care of the baby. All Steve wants is to be normal but he is about to find out that no one is perfect.This book has a paranormal/science fiction element to it (not sure which it is since it\u2019s so weird) that involves wasps that have the power to duplicate human babies.After being stung by a wasp, Steve starts getting visited by a queen wasp in his dreams. One who claims she can fix the baby and she will need his help to do so. Soon Steve realizes that the wasps plan on changing \u2018his\u2019 baby with one that has no flaws. One that isn\u2019t sickly. One that is perfect. And the closer the wasps get to 'finishing' the baby and making the switch, the more Steve realizes how much he loves 'his'\u00a0baby.The book asks the very important question of what it means to be normal and we get to see Steve realize that perfection means nothing because no one is really flawless.\u00a0 I loved seeing Steve grow over the course of the book and I was so proud of him by the end!This is a book I highly recommend to middle grade readers, in spite of the bugs!Note that I received an advanced copy of the book in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33062796-shannon", "userReview": "5/5The books which I award the highest ratings are the books that make me FEEL.This book, though small in size, was great in substance. The brief synopsis intrigued me. The Nest is about an older brother, Steve, desperate to help his ailing newborn brother, enlists the help of an unlikely sort: a wasp queen. She tells him they can help his baby brother, but little does Steve know that there are sinister undertones in that promise. Strongly reminiscent of Coraline and David Bowie's Labyrinth, although this book is semi-fantastical, it is also dark, gritty, and scary. Now, plot aside, my experience reading The Nest brought me to a deeply personal space within me. A good portion of this book discusses and deals with the severe medical issues that this infant baby boy suffers, and the possible prognosis of his conditions. Through Steve's eyes we see the parents struggle with hospital admissions, tests, surgeries, specialists, and the possibility that their baby may never talk, walk, feed himself, toilet on his own, or ever be able to fully think and learn. This all felt deeply personal to me because my husband and I have a young daughter with medical problems. Her symptoms are nowhere as severe as the baby in The Nest, but so much of what I read were exact thoughts I've had or experiences we've shared when she was younger. In fact, the baby's name is shockingly similar to our daughter's name, and at this realization I had to put the book down for a few moments and step back. Illness, disability, death, and the suggestion of \"what-if?\" are all covered beautifully in this heartbreaking novel. This book was such an interesting and unique take on \"If you could fix your child and start over, would you?\" that it made me internalize a lot of my own dark thoughts and fears as a mother of a child with medical issues. I cried, I mourned, it kept me up at night, and it made me think. Mostly though, it made me feel, and feel strongly. 5/5"}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/379992-chris", "userReview": "No matter how many times I tried to convince myself The Nest is set in the middle of summer when light and color are at their peak, I never really believed it and could only imagine the story in the darkest, bleakest parts of winter when the world is devoid of color.Studies have shown \"that sadness can affect our vision, making the world appear more gray, by impairing the neural processes involved in color perception.\" The effect is most pronounced in depression.Color and seasons seem like things that should be objective and verifiably absolute. Perception confuses the issues, though, and Steve isn't sure he can trust his perceptions. He's always been highly anxious and withdrawn, and now he finds himself feeling more isolated than ever as his parents worry about the things wrong with their new baby. He also worries about the unusual wasps that have built a nest under the eaves near the baby's window, the wasps that talk to him in dreams, first appeared to be angels, and say they are there to help. And there's the strange, van driving, knife sharpener guy who not all their neighbors seem to see and the phone calls his little sister keeps getting from the supposedly imaginary Mr. Nobody.Steve isn't sure what to believe. He just knows everyone is very worried about the new baby and that the world seems dark and gray.Readers have to decide what to believe, how much of this horror story takes place inside Steve's head and how much outside of it--or if there's a difference. Or if it matters. They won't have to decide to feel disturbed and captivated, because that will happen regardless. This short, accessible book is haunting and thrilling."}, {"userName": "Juan Manuel Sarmiento", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30015122-juan-manuel-sarmiento", "userReview": "El Nido es una lectura \u00e1gil que se lee de una sentada pero que contiene buenos mensajes sobre crecimiento, aceptaci\u00f3n y lucha contra tus miedos internos.
