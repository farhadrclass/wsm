The Panopticon was gritty and harsh, but not without some really lovely bits. this one is slower, more deliberate and insightful, and the lovely languid writing is back and it is tremendously effective in this setting, where the world is slooooowwwwly ending as a new ice age rolls in. oddly enough, the ice age isn't really the main focus of the book. it's more of a backdrop for the characters acting out their lives, and a way of marking time as it gets colder and colder with each subsequent chapter, all the way down to -70 C. the snow and cold and icebergs supply logistical obstacles, but also inspires some gorgeous imagery:She picks up speed. Faster. Faster. She pedals harder. Air stings hew few inches of bare skin, so it is colder than ice floes on the North Sea - or even right at the bottom of the ocean where the skeletons hold hands or do the jitterbug or bang their fists on a whole roof of ice forming overhead.if you're hoping for a realistic portrayal of how the world might end, this ain't it. this isn't a book in which people freak out and hoard food and take up religion and panic about their impending dooms. the problems are small, they are our problems: family, death, identity, love...it all takes place in an isolated scottish caravan park, in a valley surrounded by hills, where dylan - a gigantic and heavily-tattooed, but gentle and thoughtful man, has just arrived to look into selling a caravan left to him in his mother's will, which he had no idea she'd owned. prior to this, he'd lived his whole life in london, in a crumbling movie house with his beloved mother and grandmother, which they operated together until the two women died and the property was repossessed. grieving and adrift, dylan arrives in the community, stunned by his multiple losses, and his introduction to his new home is the sight of a woman named constance sleepwalking in her front yard, polishing the moon.constance is a fierce woman, protective of her eleven-year-old daughter stella (who until recently was her son cael), living her life on her own terms despite the gossip of her neighbors. part of the gossip results from her twenty-year-long romantic relationships with two men, on and off, frequently overlapping. one of them, alistair, is stella's father, who lives up the hill, but refuses to acknowledge stella as she is - occasionally dropping off presents clearly intended for the son he still stubbornly sees her as.stella is a firecracker of a character - very much like the girls in The Panopticon - spirited, fond of cussing, vivacious and tough, but also vulnerable in her new identity, hurt and resentful by the reactions of those who knew her only as cael, including the nuns at her school, and her best friend lewis, whose friendship has just gotten considerably more complicated. but she's not broken-down by others; she maintains her sass and spirit:They took her into a meeting in school and she had to say in advance that she wasn't a lesbian, or they wouldn't have let her even try to use the girls' changing room. They asked her if she was still a Christian. She explained that her family is not religious. They asked her what she knew of damnation. She asked them what they knew of autonomy. They asked her how she knew that word. She asked if they had met her mother. They said they would pray for her. She said it was not necessary. They asked if she might feel different in a few months, or if perhaps she should simply change for gym in the janitor's cupboard. She said she'd felt like this her whole life and no amount of praying was going to change it and she could use the janitor's cupboard to change, but she was a person, not a broom.she adores her unconventional mother and their life together, This sums up my entire childhood: clever shit and apocalypse-survival skills, and she immediately befriends her new neighbor dylan, casting him in the role of pal and casual father figure. the book is told from the perspectives of dylan and stella both, and we are not privy to the innerworkings of constance's mind. we only see her as they see her, which is an absolutely genius move on fagan's part. there is something so powerfully enigmatic and 'other' about constance - she is so attuned to her surroundings, and it's infinitely more mysterious to not know what she's thinking or feeling or planning. she remains a cipher, smart and strong and odd and independent, and it's so much more effective to never visit her interiors, just that she accepts stella while still mourning cael, and she teaches stella about life and duality in her own remarkable way: There is a half-female, half-male cardinal bird that is pure white down one side and bright red down the other! Google it.it's just \u2026 beautiful. i don't know what else to say. it's lovely and magical and surprising, and both the characters and the language are phenomenal: If the doctor asks her what she is most - she will tell him she is a wolf child.Her mother is winter.Their neighbor is the child of Nephilim.Her biological male donor is a future bone teapot.which sounds kooky, but is completely appropriate in context and is probably my favorite passage in the book.i will say that the opening; the italicized prologue, is completely baffling at first, but plow through it and be rewarded because it will all make sense later, i promise. it's a perfect mishmash of coming-of-age/coming-into-gender-identity story, with tentative romance elements, family secrets, the strength of community in facing the inevitable, with vivid descriptions and a perfectly understated ending.you know, one of those books.***********************************************i don't even know if i'm qualified to review this one. what she has done here in under 300 pages is more accomplished than i can even unravel. it's damn good.i'll try to make this review have better words soon."}, {"userName": "Amalia Gavea", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56789747-amalia-gavea", "userReview": "\u2018\u2019There are three suns in the sky and it is the last day of autumn- perhaps for ever.\u2019\u2019\nSince Dystopian Fiction is one of my favourite genres, The Sunlight Pilgrims had been on my list for quite some time. When one has read a significant number of Dystopian novels, the risk to feel that what you read is one of the same is always present. Thankfully this is not the case with Jenni Fagan\u2019s brilliant novel. It is beautifully written, full of emotions and with brilliantly developed themes that center around human beings and their feelings within the context of a threatening environment as Nature takes her revenge on the ones who have been violating her mercilessly for decades and decades.The year is 2020 and we are in Scotland, in a place called Clachan Fells that corresponds to the area of Campsie Fells, in central Scotland. The heaviest winter in the last 200 years has arrived and with it a terrible threat all over the world.An enormous iceberg is rapidly heading towards Britain and the casualties begin only to progress to unimaginable numbers. Three exquisite characters come together at this point. Constance, a bright young woman, feisty and brave. Stella, her daughter, who hides a shocking (to some) secret of her own. Dylan, a young man, full of doubts and despair. The relationship and the feelings of these characters are the focal point of the novel, making it as rich and fascinating as it is.\n\u2018\u2019It\u2019s old Mother Frost. She wants her wolves back.\u2019\u2019\nThe story is beautiful and terrifying. The white of an endless winter, the dark of the longest night compose a striking canvas upon which the lives of our characters unfold. How can something so beautiful be so threatening? How did we come to this? Why do humans destroy everything they touch? Why do they vilify everything they don\u2019t understand? These are the questions Stella asks, reflecting on her own life and the danger she faces, not from Nature but from humans who are the greatest criminals, hypocrites, destroyers. It is recklessness and narrow mindedness that has brought everyone to point zero and the children still aren't taught to respects the others. Therefore, what kind of future can really exist?Fagan\u2019s talent is more than evident. Without missing the importance of the setting she created, she finds the balance between a potentially apocalyptic world and the fact that emotions know no such boundaries. Love, hope, fear, regret still exist and bring us together if we let our own ice melt for a moment. She creates vivid dialogues with a poetic touch and an almost whimsical language, particularly in Stella\u2019s speech and thoughts. While Fagan describes the casualties, the riots, the havoc that has affected the citizens of the planet (...would that they had known better\u2026.), she creates images of the Bonfire Night, the fairy lights and the Christmas decorations, the snowflakes in all their quiet beauty. We have unique autumnal and wintry scenery descriptions and, possibly, the finest passage about sexual intercourse I\u2019ve ever read. She deals with issues and themes, which would have appeared mundane or even gross in the hands of an incompetent writer, with grace and raw emotions where needed. This is how a good book is written.A good book, friends, doesn\u2019t restrict itself into labels. Is it YA or not? I don\u2019t know. Is every novel that includes a teenage character a YA story? Who cares? Why is this important? What we should find attractive in The Sunlight Pilgrims is the fact that the themes of acceptance, tolerance and self-discovery within a world in danger are masterfully communicated. The rest are for argumentative reasons just because. This is not a post- apocalyptic universe. This is a very tangible reality that is closer than we think.\n\u2018\u2019...a woman who polishes the moon.\u2019\u2019\nI can\u2019t begin to describe my admiration for the character of Constance. A dreamer, an idealist and a pragmatist. A mother who goes above and beyond to create a safe haven for her child, both physically and psychologically. And this is what terrifies most of those who come in contact with her. This is why Dylan- a wonderful character- falls in love with her. Because, he is honest with himself and unafraid to face his demons.\n\u2018\u2019She is the fire and her daughter is wind.\u2019\u2019\nStella must be one of the most unique, most complex and sympathetic characters ever written. Faced with a seemingly impossible choice, she is sure of herself and her needs and fights for her beliefs. A true child of her mother, she has the unfortunate fate to live in a world that doesn't understand. So, she makes it her mission to make them understand. Not only for herself but for the future of all those she loves.If one wants to read a story where creatures like the White Walkers invade a frozen planet of where frozen zombies chase rugged-clothed survivors, then this book isn\u2019t a suitable read. You can watch Hollywood productions. If you want to read one of the most hauntingly poetic novels, then The Sunlight Pilgrims  will not disappoint you.\n\u201c...the child of a wolf may not feel like she has fangs until she finds herself facing the moon, but they are still there the whole time regardless.\u201d\nMy reviews can also be found on https://theopinionatedreaderblog.word..."}, {"userName": "Annet", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166369-annet", "userReview": "Truly one of the highlights of this year, this book.... Read a great review in the New York Times book review here: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/boo...\u201cThe Sunlight Pilgrims\u201d is a stylistically quieter novel than Fagan\u2019s bravura debut, \u201cThe Panopticon\u201d \u2014 a fiery and voice-\u00addriven effort that landed her on Granta\u2019s 2013 list of the best British novelists under 40 years old \u2014 but it is no less critical in its portrayal of marginalized people under the pressure of society\u2019s norms....Fagan is a poet as well as a novelist, and many of her images of this unbidden winter are shot through with lyric beauty. Early on, we are told that in this worst of winters \u201cicicles will grow to the size of narwhal tusks or the long bony finger of winter herself.\u201d Later, when the threesome venture out of the caravan to witness an iceberg\u2019s arrival, they observe \u201call those peaked figures of ice, like all of their ancestors have been caught by the elements on the long walk home, their souls captured by ice and snow, and below them the North Sea cracks and groans as ice floes creak and collide.\u201d The Sunlight Pilgrims is a humane, sad, funny, shimmeringly odd and beautiful novel.....it is a story about people in extreme circumstances finding one another, and finding themselves...Snow falls steadily, a shiny white glitter against the dark outside.....I already know this is going to be one of my reading highlights of 2016. What a magical book. What I call a rare gem.... Highly, highly recommended. It fits into one of my favorite categories, apocalyptic, and yet, the story is much more about a small caravan community in Scotland, plummeting into a sort of 'ice age', an ultimate and grim winter wonderland. It's a loving story of a color ful set of people, Constance and her transgender, brave daughter Stella. About Dylan who comes out to live in the caravan park grieving for his mother Vivienne and gin-brewing gran Gunn who died shortly after each other... Meanwhile temperature drops to more than minus 50 C and a huge iceberg is approaching the Scottish coast... Beautifully written, poetic and to the point at the same time, it's still, it's a story about loving bonds, it's a wonderful read.

In a Scotland caravan park, Constance, her daughter Stella, though Stella used to be a he, and Dylan, a young man from London whose mother lived in the park and had recently died, are gearing up for the coldest winter ever. The descriptions of the weather, the snow, the cold and ice are phenomenal, one can feel this weather inside their bones, the images are that vivid.The cold though surrounds a story of a mother and daughter and a young man who will learn things he did not expect. If ever I am in a survival situation I hope I know someone like Constance, she knows exactly what she and her daughter need to survive, from heat, supplies, and ways to stay alive. Stella, has to deal with kids, boys who were once her friends, but now that she is Stella, she is bullied, frowned on by the adults and accepted by only a few. So I guess in five years not much in the way of acceptance has changed. Very different story, elegant, beautiful writing. A family story and a story about climate change blended together. Change being the main theme, within and without. Each chapter starts with the temperature and one sees it slowly falling, getting colder. Will these wonderful characters survive this winter? Amazing, unforgettable story.ARC from publisher."}, {"userName": "Angela M", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m", "userReview": "It's eerie for sure and disconcerting to think that in this novel, taking place in 2020 only four years from now , that a new Ice Age is coming not just to this place in Scotland called Clachan Fells but all over the world. It's a tribute to the author that her descriptions make you feel the unbelievably cold temperatures and see the three suns in the sky , the phantom suns . The prologue is beautifully written setting the stage for the story, mainly of three unforgettable characters. Within the framework of an apocalyptic event , that you believe is coming with this frigid weather, the coldest ever in a small town of Scotland at -65 , these people are still struggling to come to grips with the things that life dealt them. In addition to surviving the brutal cold they face grief, loneliness, bullying, while trying to discover their true selves. Dylan is grieving the deaths of his mother and grandmother. \"There is an ache he cannot shift and be is uncertain how something this physical has the remotest chance of going.\" The only life he's known is at the Babylon movie theater with his mother and grandmother and now they are gone along with the theater. He leaves London for a place in a caravan park that his mother left him in Scotland near her place of birth. Family secrets are revealed in a scrap book she leaves for him and with the family tree he discovers his connections to Stella, the 12 year old transgender girl and her unconventional mother, Constance who live next door to him in the caravan park . The overriding theme, of course is the impact of global warming but yet there is so much more here and for the moments you focus on the things that haunt these somewhat fragile characters that you've come to care about , you almost forget about the looming iceberg. My favorite was Stella, who in spite of the loneliness and bullying knows exactly who she is . I also loved what a great mother Constance was , supporting and protecting Stella no matter what . I only wish there had been an epilogue but I definitely would recommend this book.Thanks to Hogarth/Crown Publishing and NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "This book is cold..... I enjoyed the characters in the book. I was expecting more to happen in the book. I thought they were going to be fighting the cold the whole time, but it's really about people and friendship and well yes, the cold. They are talking throughout the book about looking at the three suns. I thought at first this was some crazy thing that happened with the Ice Age coming, we suddenly had three suns but no, this is what they all it in the book: EXCERPT--Parhelia. It's a phenomenon that looks like three suns, but the two on either side are just reflected light-it's something to do with ice crystals.That little tidbit was nice to learn. So we have Dylan who lives in an old Cinema his gran and mom used to run, but they have both passed and he is being turned out. Dylan finds some stuff from his mom telling him to go to Clachan Fells, that she bought a caravan there. This is where Dylan goes to live and he meets some nice people and some funny characters as well. Dylan's next door neighbors are Stella and her mom Constance. They are really nice people and Dylan gets a little crush on Stella's mom. There is also Barnacle, he is a hoot and I just love him. They are bracing for the worst Winter ever, maybe even an Ice Age. Then they learn that a huge ice berg is making it's way from Norway to their little caravan town. When it gets there, things seem to go downhill pretty quick. I'm not really sure what to make of the ending. Even if I could, I can't really tell you if any of them make it or not. Backtracking a little. When they were all friends in the caravan park it was sweet. Stella and her mom would go to the dump and find good furniture that Constance could fix and resale. This is how they made their living. Stella was picked on by bullies but isn't there always something. Stella has a big story too, but NO SPOILERS. All the while they are living their lives together for what seemed like a brief time. Eating together, drinking, telling stories, keeping warm!!! I enjoyed this part of the book because of the way they all connected.

While that seems true sometimes, at other times you find a book that is pretty unique in certain ways, and isn't at all what you expected. That was definitely the case with Jenni Fagan's \nThe Sunlight Pilgrims\n. While not everything meshed the way I had hoped, this was a unique and surprising book, and it definitely has stayed in my mind.It's 2020 and the world is in the grips of the coldest temperatures on record, hitting below zero every day. There's snow in places there never was, rivers are overflowing and then freezing, and a giant iceberg is making its way from Norway to the coast of Scotland. People are panicking, rioting in the streets, and wondering if this is the end of the world. Those who can are fleeing to warmer temperatures, not that there are many places where those can be found.While he'd like to head to what he believes are warmer climes in Vietnam, Dylan MacRae is on a mission. Reeling from the losses of both his beloved grandmother and mother, and with his family's movie theater being foreclosed upon, he travels to the Scottish Highlands town of Clachan Fells, where his mother apparently bought a caravan (trailer) before her death. He hopes to eventually get to the Orkney Islands, where his grandmother was from, to scatter both of their ashes.When he arrives in Clachan Fells, he finds a community of people trying to understand what is coming and fearing the worst, expecting that this endless, brutal, unprecedented winter will be deadly for so many. He meets Constance Fairbairn, a survivalist of sorts, and her 12-year-old daughter, Stella, both of whom intrigue him in different ways. Constance lives by her own set of rules and has been judged by her fellow residents for years, and doesn't seem to care\u2014except where their judgment affects Stella.\"Before it was just poverty, pestilence, terrorists, pedophiles, drugs, eating disorders, online grooming, meteors skimming a bit too close for comfort. Now every single person...looks like they are terrified they're all about to become frozen corpses.\"Dylan quickly gets enmeshed in Clachan Fells life, and becomes a vital part of Constance and Stella's lives. His presence is welcomed by some but not all, and he finds he is actually more connected to the community than he thought. Stella struggles with identity and self-esteem issues, and is torn between wanting the approval of others and not caring. Beyond worrying about their survival, Constance wants her daughter's life to be easier than hers has been.This book was intriguing and had surprising emotional depth, as I expected the book to be more about surviving this somewhat-dystopian environment. The characters were tremendously compelling and I found myself rooting for them. I just felt at times the book didn't get fully enmeshed in its plot, and brought up points that it never resolved. My biggest pet peeve about this book, however, was that Fagan didn't use quotation marks when characters spoke, simply m-dashes, so you couldn't distinguish when different characters were talking to one another, or even who said what.Still, this is more a story about finding yourself and tapping into your own strength than it is about surviving the elements. Jenni Fagan is a talented storyteller, and this book will remain in my mind for a while.NetGalley and Crown Publishing provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

We are in Scotland where everything is covered in frost and snow. Actually, all of the world is covered in what everyone fears is going to be the next Ice Age and the extinction of humanity. The scary part is that this story takes place only 4 years from now, in 2020!While this story is quite claustrophobic and chills you to the bones, I love how it comes with a glimpse of hope. Dylan, Stella and Constance get to know each other in snowy Scotland, and their relationship is what keeps them warm during this awful winter. This shows that even though the world seems to be at an end, it's still possible to blossom and form new, intimate relationships. Furthermore, all three characters are so unique and appropriately quirky that they warm your heart while reading about icebergs, blue fingers and horrible tv news in a constant loop. Funnily enough, this book is very much different from what I normally like to read, and I wasn't sure whether to rate it 5 stars or not. It wasn't overwhelmingly beautiful from start to end, but there was something about it that took my breath away, and at the end of the day I couldn't put my finger on anything that was wrong with it.

It was slow moving and not much happened. That isn't always a deal-breaker for me, but I just didn't click with this book.All the villagers look worried and that is the worst thing. Before it was just poverty, pestilence, terrorists, pedophiles, drugs, eating disorders, online grooming, meteors skimming a bit too close for comfort. Now every single person in this hall looks like they are terrified they're all about to become frozen corpses. For the first time since the news broke, Stella gets this stabbing feeling in her heart that must be some new kind of fear. [Stella]It's November 2020 and a terrible cold is descending upon the globe, the worst winter on record. Dylan MacRae is grieving the recent loss of his mother and grandmother, as well as his home and livelihood. On the way to burying his mother's and grandmother's ashes, he stops in a caravan park where his mother frequently stayed. The caravan is next-door to Constance and her twelve-year-old daughter Stella. Dylan is instantly attracted to Constance and he becomes close friends with her daughter. Spending time with is neighbors makes him realize that he has spent his life existing rather than living. While going through his mother's belongings, he learns a devastating secret that connects him to Constance and Stella in unexpected ways.Something in him comes from this rock, these mountains, this landscape, something older than time and generational -- all those links to people who survived this place and thrived and lived, all those suicidal monks and one lone sunlight pilgrim, butt-naked and tough as hell. [Dylan]I've been reading so many cold weather books lately! The entire story takes place during the winter of 2020-2021. It's divided into four parts and the temperature plummets to dangerous levels as the months pass. The characters live in a caravan park in the Scottish village of Clachan Falls. I enjoyed the unique little village and its eccentric inhabitants. It was like a bleak Stars Hollow! The writing is poetic and there's is an urgent, exuberant quality to it that made me feel wonderment for nature. There are no quotation marks; the dialogue is differentiated with dashes. I didn't have trouble following the conversations like I have with some novels with unique punctuation usage (See: All Things Cease to Appear). The story alternates between the perspectives of Dylan and Stella. Constance is also a central character, but we only view her through the eyes of Dylan and Stella.\u00a0All their robot children like their knobs and buttons shiny and silver and none of them understand what a real robot has to withstand, if they are to have so much rust but still be able to run as fast as the others on sports day or sing as loud at Christmas. The carols! 'Little Donkey', the verse about Mary carrying the heavy load, it always makes her cry. [Stella]I had to force myself through Dylan's chapters, but I did love his relationship with Stella.\u00a0Stella is my favorite part book and I was most engaged during her coming-of-age sections. She is mature, self-assured, and has a great sense of humor. She came out as transgender thirteen months before the book starts. Her father refuses to acknowledge her transition and she is bullied by the kids at school. She also worries about her mother and thinks Constance deserves much better than the men she chooses.There are interesting parallels drawn with the intensifying weather and Stella's rapidly changing situation. While the climate is going through an intense change and a glacier creeps its way to the shores of her community, Stella's starts going through puberty. She wants to take hormone pills, but dangerous weather and the attitudes of others are a huge roadblock. There are also tie-ins with the past coming to roost in the present: the light from stars, a glacier from a million years ago bringing a winter (\"If the world has fifteen million years of frozen geology there and it can enter the present and melt and bring forth another Ice Age...\"), and Constance's conversation with Stella about embryos following a female blueprint for the first ten weeks.Stella is like the wind outside and Constance is the fire. The wind is gentle, blowing lightly to brighten the flames, to stop the fire going out. [Dylan]Constance is a survivalist. I admired her resourcefulness and determination.\"Luck and tenacity are her only employer.\"\u00a0She is Stella's biggest advocate and her biggest fear is not being able to protect Stella in a\u00a0cruel and unforgiving world. Constance has two lovers and the community judges her for it, though her lovers escape the same judgment. Constance knows what she wants. She doesn't hide who she is and she doesn't care what anyone thinks.Stella tugs the wolf-head until the ears sit perfectly; two long furry arms snake down on either side of her braids and the fur is white, like the wolf walked right out of the snow -- like winter herself created it from particles of ice and dust and sent it out to find a mortal girl who isn't afraid of the big bad wolf, who knows how to use an axe and stir her own porridge, who knows that worth isn't something you let another person set for you, it is something you set for yourself. [Stella]Now for what I didn't like! The story moved at a glacial pace and I wasn't engaged in the story as a whole. I don't always dislike slow-moving. character-driven books. A few things happened here:(1) While I understand the comparisons to Station Eleven, those comparisons also had me expecting a little more plot.(2) If I'm already disinterested, poetic writing that sometimes drifts into streams of consciousness intensifies that feeling.(3) I kept feeling teased with action (using the word 'action' lightly here). Anytime something interesting happened or I felt the tension build, the scene would cut and we would move forward in time. The parts I was most interested in happened offstage. It drew attention to how little was actually happening outside of the character's thoughts and I lost patience. The characters do experience growth, but it was so gradual that it felt like nothing was happening.Despite my reservations about the rest of the book. I thought the ending was appropriate. It's possible I assumed too much about what happened. It was very abrupt. I would have LOVED\u00a0an\u00a0epilogue that mirrored the beautifully-written prologue!All those little lies, left unsaid, in families; all the things that then become unsayable.The selfish dead fuck off and leave us with half-truths and questions and random relations and bankruptcy and debt and bad hearts and questionable genetics and stupid habits and DNA codes for diseases and they never mention all the things that are coming -- like a fight at a wedding, it just breaks out one day. [Dylan]In conclusion: I was disinterested for the most part, but I loved Stella and the setting enough to keep reading. I think the same part of me that had difficulty appreciating Fates & Furies\u00a0(especially Lotto's section) had difficulty getting into The Sunlight Pilgrims. It was one of those \"It's not you, it's me!\" books. It's receiving very high ratings from many respected reviewers. If you are looking for a quiet literary book with interesting characters and an immersive setting, this book may be for you. Here is a list of books I thought of while reading:\u2022\u00a0Becoming Nicole: True story about a transgender girl and her family. Stella's experience mirrors Nicole's in many ways.\u2022\u00a0The Dog Stars: Surviving in a post-apocalyptic world, grief, coping, global catastrophe not the main point.\u2022\u00a0The\u00a0Quality of Silence: Set in the modern world and plot-driven, but interesting mother/daughter relationship and Arctic setting. 10-year-old\u00a0deaf girl experiences bullying because of her differences.\u2022\u00a0Good Morning, Midnight : I'm about 75% through this one right now. It shares many qualities with The Sunlight Pilgrims: Quiet, character-driven novel, post-apocalyptic, surviving in freezing temperatures (Antarctica), the global catastrophe takes a backseat to internal struggles, etc. Oddly enough, the things I didn't like in The Sunlight Pilgrims, I am loving in this Good Morning, Midnight!\nStella holds the clear tusk out in front of her -- puts it up to her head as if she is the unicorn -- she spins around, holding the icicle out in front of her as a spear- - jabbing it into air to show the spirit plane that she is her mother's daughter -- that the child of a wolf may not feel like she has fangs until she finds herself facing the moon, but they are still there the whole time regardless.\n_____________________I received this book for free from LibraryThing Early Reviewers program and Hogarth books in exchange for an honest review.

Any reservations I had left even after reading glowing reviews disappeared and I found that I was always eager to return to Jennie Fagan\u2019s story of nuclear winter set in Scotland. That the setting is only a mere four years away made it all the more compelling. When temperatures begin to plunge, there is the inevitable social and economic crisis associated, but while Fagan incorporates those issues, the focus remains on the people. The setting, while bitterly cold even at the start, is beautifully revealed through Fagan\u2019s lovely prose. The characters are so utterly normal underneath their quirks and unconventionality, so relatable. Even Dylan MacRae, a rather unusual soul, who leaves his family\u2019s Soho theatre behind, following his mother\u2019s wish, carrying his mother, and grandmother back to the Scotland\u2019s highlands of her younger years. Stella, a young trans-girl, and her exceptional mother Constance. At their core, these are just everyday people going about their everyday lives under newly extraordinary circumstances. All the while news continually shows footage of this new \u201cIce Age\u201d on their horizon. Despite these predictions, this floating iceberg of significant proportions changing the climate of the world, the focus is on making do through the winter, waiting for the Spring, with hope and appreciation for the beauty in their changing environment. The parhelia \u2013 three suns appearing in the sky. The frost flowers made from curls of ice, each petal perfection only winter can create, this newly forming world is seen through appreciative and hopeful eyes. Dylan\u2019s mother has left him the trailer she owned at some time in the past, and a scrapbook. Dylan\u2019s heart yearns for the Babylon movie theatre he ran with his mother and grandmother. He hopes to set up a makeshift theatre in the summer, tying up sheets for a screen. When Dylan arrives at the caravan park, the community where Stella and Constance live in Clachan Fells\u2019s Ash Lane, his eyes take in the \u201crow of silver bullet caravans,\u201d the mountain range around them, and the sight of a sleepwalking Constance out in the yard, polishing the moon. He\u2019s a bit smitten.Stella and Constance live in the nearest trailer. Stella eagerly befriends Dylan, and it isn\u2019t long before she invites her new friend to dinner, where he officially meets Constance. Stella\u2019s hoping they\u2019ll strike up a friendship or romance. The three grow to depend on each other as the nights grow colder, spending more time together as time slips by. While global warming is central to the overall picture, this is really about three somewhat dispirited, but strong individuals, each with a unique and compelling story of their own, and how, and when, their lives become entwined.

As people who know me know, this might hint at a lesser enjoyment of the book for me than I think other people will have. I've read many disaster novels and have some baseline expectations for the realism I require to find truth in the story. In this book it is an ice age instead of a virus, with a smaller cast of characters and narrower themes of sexual identity (one character is transgender and suffering from lack of good medicine/treatment due to the disaster). At the same time the science feels inconsistent and more of a flavor than a reality. For instance, people are chopping wood at -20 degrees and at -6 degrees some children die by falling through the ice on a lake. An iceberg is simultaneously encroaching on the small Scottish village where the characters are living in a mobile home park (\"caravan\") and melting, raising the water level. (Can this happen in -44 degrees?) These kinds of seeming impossibilities pulled me out of the story a bit. It is possible that this IS the science but it didn't quite feel logical. And while almost all of Europe is frozen in, and nobody can get food, they speak of fishing and make cannibalism jokes (whereas everyone seems to assume that as long as they have enough heat for the winter, they will be able to take care of the details in the spring/summer... I'm not sure ice ages are that short or that forgiving.)While an ice age is interesting, I think the meat of this story is Stella and her journey of identity - how to navigate bullying and personhood is always compelling no matter the context. In fact, the ice age slows that down and limits her options considerably, in frustrating ways. Dylan's story is interesting until he ends up sleeping with a completely different character than I expected, which also serves to move him more into the background. His backstory and family tree discovery seem unnecessary and muddy the flow a bit. Shouldn't it be the ice age that is the most startling thing?Solid 3.5 stars, I expect most literary readers to give it a 4 or higher, and I would love to reward the author in some way for a fair portrayal of the confusing world of a trans teenager.Thanks to the publisher for providing a review copy through Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Puck", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18562856-puck", "userReview": "This book is something else. You better sit down somewhere cosy while you read this, because the story is gripping, intriguing and above all it\u2019s cold. It\u2019s November 2020 and a terrible cold is descending upon the globe, the worst winter in centuries. The Thames freezes over and hundreds of people die from the icy weather. In these harsh times we follow Dylan, Constance and Stella as they try to survive the low temperatures and the lack of sunlight, as well as their own personal problems. \n I met someone once who told me you can drink energy from the sun, store it in your cells so you grow strong. She said we should all do it. It\u2019s like a back-up store of it in your cells; she said there were sunlight pilgrims doing it all the time \u2013 it\u2019s how they get through the dark, by stashing up as much light as they can. \nThe Sunlight Pilgrims  is the second book by author Jenni Fagan and it\u2019s a slow book. This is a good thing because the calm pace makes you able to better enjoy the beautiful prose, the truly chilling descriptions of the ice and snow, and the bonds that Dylan, Constance and Stella develop with each other. In a way this book reminded me of a book I read earlier this year (The Trees by Ali Shaw) because in both books a natural disaster forms the backdrop to the problems of the MC\u2019s, which are the actual driving force of the story. The strongest character in this book to me is Stella. She\u2019s 12-year old, self-assured girl with a great sense of humour, but she\u2019s also a male-to-female transgender. I\u2019ve never read about a (young) trans-character before but I found the way Fagan described Stella and the struggle with her identity just beautiful and very realistic. In the book Stella started her transition thirteen months ago and while her coming-out is met with disapproval from the community, her crush, and her own father, she keeps her head up. Fagan draws an interesting parallel between the upcoming winter and Stella\u2019s body going through puberty: while the temperatures drop, Stella\u2019s gender dysphoria increases.  \n She dries herself with a blue towel and looks in the mirror. She has no breasts. That\u2019s okay. That\u2019s fine. A beard is less good. A deep voice is a terrifying thought. Sometimes, in quiet moments like this, she has to fight not to hate her body for threatening her with a baritone. She won\u2019t do that, though, she won\u2019t let herself hate it, because her body is a good one. It is strong. A girl is a girl is a girl. \nYou can\u2019t help but fall in love with Stella\u2019s determination and grit. Her gender is an important part of her character but never the most defining one: Stella remains a 12-year old girl who worries about her crush and gets excited about the snow. She\u2019s a transgender but she\u2019s also a child, and I loved how her mother and Dylan realized this and supported her unconditionally. Dylan...was okay. He is a newcomer to the Scottish town of Clachan Fells and moved there because both his beloved grandmother and mother passed away in the last 6 months, and he was forced to sell their family movie-theatre. Dylan therefore doesn\u2019t only deal with grief and loss, but also with feelings of failure. He just doesn\u2019t want to face those emotions, and so he spends the first 40% of the book befriending Stella and falling in love with her mother. In the end I do think he\u2019s an interesting MC and he\u2019s definitely a good person, but I just hated how in the beginning Dylan\u2019s moments of grief were overshadowed by his crush on Constance. Constance though, I absolutely loved. The woman is independent, resourceful and tough as nails. She\u2019s a survivalist and no matter how hard life has been to her, she\u2019s willing to do everything to keep herself and her child safe. That vow has gotten harder since Stella\u2019s transition, so Constance biggest concern in this book is, besides battling the cruel winter, to help and defend her daughter as best as she can. I was glad that Dylan became her ally in this, but the mother-daughter relationship between Constance and Stella was one of the best parts of this book.  \nStella is like the wind outside and Constance is the fire. The wind is gentle, blowing lightly to brighten the flames, to stop the fire from going out. \nCriticism:  As my review shows, I found the characters stronger and more compelling than the story itself. Both are intriguing and the calm pace worked well in slowly revealing the depth of everyone\u2019s problems, but it also ate away my reading-enthusiasm. Especially Dylan\u2019s first chapters were a pain to read. I also disliked how the writer used m-dashes instead of quotation marks, so it wasn\u2019t always clear who said what. The ending of the book felt me feeling lost. I\u2019ve liked to have a short epilogue to be certain of spring and a hope of a new start, because while I know everyone\u2019s going to be okay, I\u2019d have liked to be sure. Overall, this book is about identity: who are we as a person, what is our place in our family, and on a broader level, who do you want to seem to be to the outside world? It\u2019s about trusting yourself and relying on others in dark times, and while the plot isn\u2019t as strong, the prose and the characters definitely are. A perfect book for this fall/winter. 3,5 stars."}, {"userName": "Arielle Walker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6762949-arielle-walker", "userReview": "\u201c...the child of a wolf may not feel like she has fangs until she finds herself facing the moon, but they are still there the whole time regardless.\u201d\n There is absolutely no question: the writing here is stunning. Stella is also a fantastic, engaging character - I just wish the others had the same depth. There's a little manic-pixie-dream syndrome going on here, along with a good solid case of insta-love, and on reflection I found I had very little attachment to either Dylan or Constance. To be fair, we only ever see Constance through the eyes of those around her, while Stella and Dylan let us into their deepest thoughts - almost. There's always that hint of a wall up, barred against the reader and maybe even their own minds.But oh the words are so gorgeous - a whole extra star simply for the images, the silent, frozen word Fagan conjures up, the stunning, haunting turns of phrase. One last thing - and this is not related to the book so much as the reviews of it: an apocalypse is not automatically a dystopia, and vice versa.

Despite my increasing wariness for dystopian tales, this one manages to feel quite fresh. The world is undergoing something of an icy Pompeii, and it's progressing more quickly than any scientists foresaw coming. It's snowing mostly everywhere, temperatures won't stop plummeting to alarming depths, and civilization is running out of places to outrun it. Dylan MacRae, a loner who worked at his family's Soho movie theatre, leaves it behind for for the Scottish highlands, carrying the ashes of his grandmother and mother. Dylan has always lived life on the fringe - he's taller than everyone else and there's some talk he's descended from \"giants,\" he doesn't easily connect with others, he's never really been in love. All that changes when he arrives at the caravan his mother left him, and meets Constance and Stella. His first glimpse of a sleepwalking Constance has her \"polishing the moon\" outside her trailer, and he's immediately besotted. Constance is mother to Stella, a young trans teenager who has several battles to fight here. Her peers of this small community knew her first as a young boy, and it's difficult for them to accept this \"new\" Stella, who she feels she has been all along. She's been both physically and emotionally tortured, and it continues throughout the book as she struggles for acceptance - and the right to be herself and obtain hormone blockers when doctors disdainfully feel there are more pressing priorities in the face of this new frozen frontier - but she's a fighter. Stella is a wonderful character, a natural leader, a glue between the disparate and panicky adults here. The changing atmosphere is so key here that the ominous icy weather feels like another character in itself. Fagan's descriptions of the pervasive snow and cold are so vivid that it's easy to envision a world both gently and fiercely blanketed, unusual groups of individuals bonding together desperate to kindle any modicum of warmth.One star docked because that conclusion was incredibly dissatisfying, even if this is an almost perfect book otherwise."}, {"userName": "Suzanne Leopold", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9004645-suzanne-leopold", "userReview": "giving away a copy on my blog https://www.facebook.com/suzyapproved...#"}, {"userName": "Lark Benobi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73768036-lark-benobi", "userReview": "I'm torn on how to review this novel.

For me the story felt underdeveloped, and the syntax felt a little unmoored from any concrete idea I could make for myself about what it meant. There are too many themes and characters packed in. I didn't feel invested in any of them. I had trouble following events.

I had a whole conflicting mixture of feelings while reading this, and I even felt the need to write some notes about it on my phone while I was still reading it, which I never do.I'll begin with what I liked about it. I thought the characters were great - to start off with the story follows Dylan, who moves from London to Scotland as the apocalypse begins, and after he becomes a part of his new neighbours lives we mostly follow them - 11-year old Stella and her mother, Constance, who live next door to Dylan in the caravan park. When I read that this book took place during an apocalypse in the near future, I thought it would be the main focus, but it really isn't. The bulk of the story focuses on the relationships between the main characters, Stella's struggle transitioning and dealing with bullying from her classmates and former friends, and Constance and Dylan becoming closer to each other. Change is a big focus of this novel, and it is set to a background of Britain descending into another Ice Age.Another thing I liked about this was the writing, Jenni Fagan did a great job of evoking a cold atmosphere in an original way.However, there were a few things that knocked a star off this one for me. The main thing was that there is a little plot, and entire chapters go by without much really happening. Sometimes this doesn't bother me in a book, but coupled with little dialogue and a lot of description, I felt impatient sometimes while reading it, waiting for something to actually happen. One thing that may bother other readers is the lack of speech marks.

It\u2019s November, before true winter has even arrived and the weather outside is -6\u00b0F. By the end of January temperatures will have dropped to -38\u00b0 and a small village in Scotland is struggling to endure.\n\u2018Dark is following them. It\u2019s coming to cloak everything. Each day it will eat a little more light until they will wake up one morning to find the sun won\u2019t rise again.\u2019\nThe alarming Ice Age chronicled in these pages never quite becomes the focal point for this story. It\u2019s the aura surrounding the true story. The dire circumstances help to establish the characters and showcases their most base natures, but at center stage is twelve year old Stella Fairbairn, who thirteen months ago used to be referred to as \u2018he\u2019.\n\u2018Cael Fairbairn has ceased to exist. Thirteen months ago the girl that wore his body got up and told everyone to quit calling her by the wrong pronoun.\u2019\nStella has finally found some form of peace after no longer having to show the world one person when the person she feels she is on the inside is completely different. She\u2019s headstrong and determined to find her new place in the world amidst all the appalling bullying she\u2019s forced to deal with from her classmates who she used to call friends. She resorts to finding people with similar stories on the internet to make her feel less alone and to find people that will accept her for how she is. Meanwhile, her and everyone else fights to stay alive in the rapidly changing climate. And at heart, that\u2019s what this story is all about: surviving. Whether it\u2019s surviving growing up in a society that refuses to accept you for who you are or whether it\u2019s surviving in a harsh and unforgiving climate, it\u2019s all the same.Stella isn\u2019t the only enticing character in the book; its chock-full of them. Constance, Stella\u2019s free-spirited, survivalist mother, Dylan, the giant of a man who arrives in the village carrying the ashes of his mother and grandmother, and their neighbors which include a porn star, lesbian school teachers, some Satan worshipers, and a guy determined to prove the existence of aliens. While their descriptions alone would seem to guarantee a most quirky read, The Sunlight Pilgrims was a surprisingly subdued and almost peaceful read about the possible end of the world as we know it. Fagan has once again placed the spotlight on individuals that would typically be relegated to darkened corners. The Panopticon gave juvenile offenders the spotlight and now The Sunlight Pilgrims displays the marginalization of individuals undergoing a gender transition. Between the doctors that suggested anti-depressants to her instead of the hormone blockers she requested and the majority of the community that looks on her with nothing but disdain. All while this is happening, the Ice Age is still coming on slowly but surely. It all seems so insignificant that these individuals are still able to maintain their scorn and self-righteousness while there are more important things going on outside; like the world ending.Fagan\u2019s writing is almost restrained yet still remains vibrant and descriptively lush. She aptly describes icicles growing to the size of narwhal tusks, \n\u201c\u2026the long bony finger of winter herself.\u201d\n While the world around them is being encased in ice, there is still a remarkable beauty to be found.\n\u2018Sun spirals down through treetops showing up sediments of silver and amber dust. A frozen pond. Curls of ice make a frost flower on a fallen bough. Each iced petal is perfectly curled and see-through. Winter has been hand-carving them overnight. Placing them here.\u2019\n\n\u2018A flock of birds fly low overhead.Mossy greens and purples and red-golds have faded to brown.Sleet billows off the mountain.Treetops disappear in one blink as the white owerblaw races over the mountaintop and drifts down thicker and faster, painting everything white until within seconds the whole landscape is utterly changed.\u2019\nWhile the mere concept of negative double digit temperatures is horrifying, Fagan manages to make it a poetic experience. There\u2019s even a pinch of magical realism added to this most realistic world, when Dylan first sets eyes on Constance, \n\u201c\u2026she reaches up a pale arm up into the sky and polishes the moon.\u201d\n It was a frivolous addition to the story, however, it added a touch of magic to the existing beauty and I loved it.When I sat down to write this review tonight, I was distressed because I didn\u2019t have any idea what to say about this story or if I\u2019d even be able to successfully explain what made it so special. I spent over an hour researching salinity and the North Atlantic Drift so that I could understand just how something like what happened in this story could actually happen. My research took me right back to how this story made me feel: aghast yet somehow sanguine. Survival is always a possibility, no matter the circumstances.I received this book free from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review."}], "description": "It's November of 2020, and the world is freezing over, each day colder than the last. There's snow in Israel; the Thames is overflowing; and an iceberg separated from the Fjords in Norway is expected to drift just off the coast of Scotland. As ice water melts into the Atlantic, frenzied London residents evacuate by the thousands for warmer temperatures down south--but not Dylan. Grieving and ready to build life anew, he heads north to bury his mother's and grandmother's ashes on the Scottish islands where they once lived. Hundreds of miles away, twelve-year-old Estella and her survivalist mother, Constance, scrape by in the snowy, mountainous Highlands, preparing for a record-breaking winter. Living out of a caravan, they spend their days digging through landfills, searching for anything with restorative and trading value. When Dylan arrives in their caravan park in the middle of the night, life changes course for Estella and Constance. Though the weather worsens, his presence brings a new light to daily life, and when the ultimate disaster finally strikes, they'll all be ready. The Sunlight Pilgrims is a visionary story of courage and resilience in the midst of nature's most violent hour. It's by turns an homage to the portentous beauty of our natural world, and to just how strong we can be, if the will and the hope is there, to survive its worst.", "title": "The Sunlight Pilgrims", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22399997-the-sunlight-pilgrims", "average": 3.59, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1445205975l/22399997.jpg", "reviews": 391, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4474178.Jenni_Fagan", "name": "Jenni Fagan"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Science Fiction", "Science Fiction", "Magical Realism", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22399997-the-sunlight-pilgrims", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27272259-the-sunlight-pilgrims", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28428672-the-sunlight-pilgrims", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27993227-the-sunlight-pilgrims", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29845613-the-sunlight-pilgrims", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13073519-the-panopticon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28239366-the-dead-queen-of-bohemia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9749893-urchin-belle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16049796-the-acid-burn-no-face-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32054093-untitled"]}
