The baby is a sweetheart. I liked how Clarice and Charles relationship grows slowly. The behind the scenes at the newspaper office made for an interesting read."}, {"userName": "Joanie Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12027480-joanie-bruce", "userReview": "I loved everything about this historical romance. Clarice Gordon, a career woman, becomes a part-time nanny to her boss\u2019s brother. She is so focused on cementing and furthering her career as a journalist, yet the joy of caring for the small child becomes an even more important task.What I liked: I loved the way Clarice shows such love and concern for whatever task she is given, whether it be working for the paper she is writing for, or caring for the brother of her boss. She learns to bloom where she is planted and falls in love, with both the little boy she is caring for as well as her boss. Both main characters, Clarice and Charles, grow and mature in character from the beginning of the story until the end, and you can\u2019t help but fall in love with them both.What I didn\u2019t like: Honestly, there was nothing I could find fault with.Ms. Clark wove a satisfying tale, and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire book. Over all, I give this book five stars, and I recommend it to all lovers of historical fiction."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5623600-carolyn", "userReview": "Not sure about this one -- I liked the story a lot but kept getting confused about what the whole \"career debate\" part of the story was for. It seemed like Charles kept expecting Clarice to want to stay home with the baby, and when at the end she actually does choose to stay with Charles and little Jonathan it seemed like she was giving in a little bit (although I think she does still want to be able to work)."}, {"userName": "Janis Kay", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6033194-janis-kay", "userReview": "This is an excellent read with excellent characters and a cutie pie! Charles and Clarice make (again) an excellent team lol. I loved getting to know the behind the scenes work of the paper business and found it fascinating that they answered reader questions just like libraries in the bigger cites:) That's my inner librarian crooning xDRead this!"}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23176258-ellen", "userReview": "Sweet story.Sometimes we need a hand up. If you stay true to your goals and work hard, you will achieve good things. When you are considerate of others, good things will come to you.

The father of Clarice was a person I would like to have met up side the head with a frying pan and the boys mother I wont even dignify with a answer. It was the little boy who reached out and grabbed me though. So young but so trusting of Clarice from the start makes me wish for those carefree days again."}, {"userName": "Seema", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51526559-seema", "userReview": "Another well written book by Dorothy Clarke.
