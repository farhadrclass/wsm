{"ratings": 134, "userreviews": [{"userName": "Werner", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/903390-werner", "userReview": "Note (Oct. 26, 2012): I edited this review to correct a factual error in the first draft as to what the original title of the book was.20th-century British novelist Lofts was primarily a masterful author of historical fiction, but she also had a definite fascination for things uncanny and supernatural. Usually, if this strain appears in her books, it's just as a low-key, leavening hint here and there of the possibly paranormal in what's clearly 99.999% a work of descriptive fiction. But occasionally, she allowed herself to write a work where the supernatural element is key to the plot. Gad's Hall is an example, and this excellent novel is another one.That's not to say that this is a novel in which the supernatural is a paramount concern from beginning to end, where every page oozes ghostly menace. The author doesn't check her descriptive fiction skills at the door, and she blends her paranormal doings (which begin almost imperceptibly about a fourth of a way into the book, and slowly build to a crescendo in the denouement) with first-class historical fiction. Our geographical setting is her favorite one: Suffolk, in the area around her fictional town of Baildon (modeled on her longtime hometown, Bury-St.-Edmunds) where so many of her novels are set; in this case, the little village of Clevely. The time is the 1790s, when the trend in the English countryside toward enclosure of formerly common land, enriching the largest landowners at the expense of cottagers with no provable title to their homes and pastures, was becoming an irresistable Juggernaut. (Lofts doesn't write the novel as a Populist or Socialist tract --her own politics were staunchly Tory-- and her treatment of the economics of enclosure is more balanced than a writer such as Jack London would have made of it, but she doesn't stint on description of the corrupt, exploitative nature of the process or the very real suffering it inflicted on helpless and innocent people.) We also have a glimpse of late 18th-century India, with the native states in the cross-hairs of the East India Company. (How does she get from Suffolk to India, you ask?.... Well, you'll just have to read the book! :-) )Her talent for creating round, fully-drawn, very human characters that you can totally relate to (and that includes many of the myriad secondary characters as well as the major ones), and depicting their relationships --familial, social, marital, romantic, etc. -- with her trademark perception, realism and compassion is fully on display here. Clevely comes to life under her pen, and we come to care deeply about its residents, and wax really indignant at the villains (because she has a couple of those too, who are a pair of literature's nastiest). We get a look at love, lovelessness in marriage, infatuation and sexual situations that could arise as easily today as then (and vice versa); we see some of the effects of the constricting gender and class attitudes of the time; and we get an inside view of Methodist dissent in that day, which remains a very relevant view for today. It's a \"warts-and-all\" view, because Lofts shines a critical light on some of the less defensible, but all too common, modes of evangelical thinking. But it's a constructive criticism, not an anti-religious hatchet job; Loft's own Christian beliefs, evident elsewhere in her writing, are particularly clear in this novel. That's because the supernatural influence that's shown to be at work here is that of Satan himself; and the battle lines are drawn, because, as one of the characters says, \"If you credit one side with power, then you must credit the other....\" So the supernatural tale here is one of the spiritual struggle between good and evil, God and Satan --the type of supernatural fiction I personally most appreciate and relate to. And the crux of the struggle will be in the heart and mind of an untried young Methodist girl, Damask Greenway, who (like Mina Harker in Dracula) will be the object of a tug-of-war between Heaven and Hell.This novel was republished in 1967 as The Deadly Gift, and in 1968 as The Devil in Clevely, both times by different publishers than the original one. However, Afternoon of an Autocrat was the original title (though I admit to considering The Devil in Clevely much more apt and descriptive).I could pile on a lot more superlative praise for this book; but you as a reader will have more fun discovering its various rewards for yourself, and I highly recommend that you do (provided that you aren't too prejudiced to tolerate its worldview, and that you don't mind a slow style of storytelling that draws its human background with deep texture and color rather than a few hasty pencil strokes). Lofts was popular in her own lifetime, but she's never received the posthumous recognition she deserves, both in the historical and (though she was less prolific in it) the supernatural genres. IMO, this work is one of her best (that I've read), hands down.Note: I learned after writing this review of the 20-chapter version that a 21st chapter exists, which is published in some editions; I haven't actually seen the first edition, so I'm not sure if that chapter was part of the original text or not. The longer version just brings a greater degree of closure to one of the plot lines."}, {"userName": "Florence Penrice", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3447426-florence-penrice", "userReview": "Norah Lofts was a great story teller, and this is one of her best books. The background is Enclosure, how it worked and the effect it had on rural communities and, if that makes it sound dull, it isn't, as she had the gift of inventing characters and situations that just keep you turning the pages. I know of no other historical novelist (though I would be pleased to hear of them) who could write so well about the history of ordinary people. No writer of historical fiction can claim to understand how people felt in the past, and Ms Lofts writes with a 1950s sensibility, but as I'm a child of the '50s, that doesn't bother me. Anything that she wrote relating to the post-World War II period is worth avoiding, however, as, in common with other writers of the period, her attitudes to class and race aren't so palatable today. As in this book, much of her work refers to witchcraft, which is of less interest today than when it was written. The enourmous contemporary popularity of Dennis Wheatley's writing demonstrates the interest in the subject.If you want to see how badly this subject can be covered, try (or not) the truly terrible Wildacres trilogy by Philippa Gregory, who seemeed to be undecided whether to write history or pornography and has found a useful niche in combining both (though, to be fair, she sometimes elects to leave out the history)."}, {"userName": "Deb Atwood", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5374404-deb-atwood", "userReview": "I read this novel as part of a discussion led by Werner at the Goodreads Supernatural Group.I find it\u2019s interesting to read books by novelists who reach back in time to write about a former era. Hey, what can I say? I did it myself with Moonlight Dancer.I think of Nathaniel Hawthorne, a 19th century writer who focused on 17th century New England in The Scarlet Letter. I think of John Harwood reaching from the 21st century back to 19th century with his gothic novel The S\u00e9ance. In a previous post I compared Harwood\u2019s depiction of 19th century female sensibilities with those of Wilkie Collins.Today, we have 20th century author Norah Lofts writing about 18th century Suffolk, England. The setting is a rural community beset with the forces of those who would enclose the common land (the landed gentry) versus those who traditionally had free access to the land in question (the farming poor).Our story opens with autocrat Charles Shelmadine as he travels the countryside atop Bob the horse dispensing ill-advised advice to all obliged to listen. It\u2019s a neat literary device as we thus meet our cast of characters: Damask Greenway, her OCD evangelist father, Damask\u2019s love interest Danny, forgetful Mrs. Parsons et al. The author does a good job of world-building via a leisurely pace, not unlike trotting down country lanes with Old Bob, inspecting turnip yields and cobblers\u2019 kitchens. (However, I did find some of the Amos Greenaway church-building ruminations tedious.) Still, along the way author Lofts entertains readers with her gentle satire.All is torn asunder when Sir Charles dies (not a spoiler as this happens early on and sets the plot in motion). Enter spoiled autocrat scion Richard Shelmadine and his delightful albeit browbeaten wife Linda. Soon, Richard\u2019s dissolute lifestyle leads him to unsavory Mr. Mundford\u2013he who neither ages nor loses at cards. Much to Linda\u2019s dismay, Mr. Mundford and Richard begin to explore the mysteries of Mithras worship. Meanwhile, feisty Damask ponders a power all her own. The question is, can Linda put all to rights? My lips are sealed tighter than the underground chamber chez Shelmadine.Finally, the lives of the community members coalesce in a dazzling, blood-stirring d\u00e9nouement well worth the wait.And, speaking of endings, a cautionary note. Our intrepid leader Werner discovered that not all editions of this novel are created equal. Apparently, some editions do not include the last chapter. Catastrophe! Is this some budget-minded publisher\u2019s ploy or the author\u2019s desire for ambiguity? All I can say is that I adore Chapter 21. So if, like me, you are a sentimental fool, make sure your last chapter begins thus: On an October evening in the year 1798, Matt Ashpole drove home\u2026"}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1853790-barbara", "userReview": "The original title , the one Norah Lofts gave it, is \"The Devil in Clevely\" and it is to my mind, a far better one. The first section dealing with the death of Sir Charles which sets the whole in motion, is indeed the literal death of an autocrat, as well as the symbolic ending of an old era. But his death is only a beginning. The other alternative title, \"The Deadly Gift\", is equally partial in it's application, referring to the unearthly qualities discovered in the heroine. For this is not just about Damask and her life, it is a complex and ambitious tale, at once a love story, a story of supernatural powers, and also the tale of the the great tide of Enclosures in rural England and in it's wake, change, bringing both misery and progress. Added to all this is the arrival of Richard, Sir Charles' heir from India, dissolute, satiated with life and dangerously open to the influences of what has to be called evil.Sir Richard , his wife, a gamekeeper , Damask the preacher's daughter , and the truly sinister Mr Mundford from London play out their destiny and the battle of Good and Evil in the beautiful Suffolk country side.Great stuff!"}, {"userName": "Veronlca", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37291756-veronlca", "userReview": "Great readI have yet to find an author of historical fiction to compare with Nora Lofts.

He ruled his little village 'kingdom' with a gentle but firm hand, and was genuinely liked and respected by his tenants for his warm demeanor. He kindly instructed his tenants on the best way to grow their crops; raise their children and handle their love affairs. However, when Sir Charles passed away rather suddenly and unexpectedly, the village stirred uneasily.The villagers main unease grew from the arrival of the new Squire, Sir Richard Shelmadine. As Sir Charles' son, Sir Richard had recently returned from overseas and seemed quite ready and more than eager to take over his father's title. However, Sir Richard was an unusually secretive man; and the new squire had some very strange ideas. He also surrounded himself with even stranger friends - friends like the mysterious Mr. Mundford.The strangest thing about Mr. Mundford was that he never seemed to age, and his name was linked to the terrible and infamous Hellfire Club. Mr. Mundford was also very interested in many things that shouldn't ever have interested him. His interest bordered on obsession, really - an almost unholy fascination...with the ruins of an ancient Roman temple; with what happened in the village on All-Hallow's Night; and most especially with a silent and somber young woman with amber eyes called Damask Greenway.I have always loved Norah Lofts as an author, and despite finding the plot slightly more intricate than I was expecting, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

We meet a large variety of characters, beginning with the hidebound, enclosure-resisting old baronet, Sir Charles Shelmadine, and moving down the social scale through various local country dwellers to the poor landless cottagers living on the 'Waste' -the communal village land which they are about to lose to enclosure. Sir Charles promptly dies, and a chain of events is set in motion.The GoodThere are few writers as good as Lofts for painting a picture of English life in a bygone era. Not only do the story and characters hold you in spite of what, by contemporary standards, is a pretty meandering plot, but the book is- dare I say it? educational. The mindset of a conservative country squire, the East India Company, Methodism, enclosure, all these and more are subjects on which Lofts touches and makes you come away having learned something. Also, in spite of quite a lot of drama, the story has a happy ending.The BadAfternoon of an Autocrat has sometimes been sold as a horror story. Be warned: there is very little horror there, and Lofts is too much of a sensible pragmatist to make what there is very chilling.Historical accuracy10/10"}, {"userName": "~\u2606~Autumn\u2665\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36269827-autumn", "userReview": "One of my very favorite books as I sure enjoyed the character of Damask Greenway.
