It includes stuff like the Ontological Argument, anyway. Like the other book I've read by Peter Cave, it's interesting and presents difficult puzzles quite flippantly. It cross-references the puzzles, so if you're interested in a particular line of thought, you can follow it right through the book."}, {"userName": "LKM", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1533779-lkm", "userReview": "Was it me or were most of those puzzles neither puzzling nor perplexing?

Well what if you though B instead?!' - the issue being that in most cases I didn't think A to start with, so there was never a 'puzzle' moment or a shock at seeing the world in a new light. I hated how the author tried to be funny, pages were wasted whilst he wrote 'witty' metaphors that often fell flat. I think it suffers from trying to make philosophy palatable for the masses - which it fails miserably at anyway.

The author is pretty hilarious. I enjoyed his writing style very much. The book speaks about  paradoxes  so it is fair to assume that the writer will speak from every possible angle, right? Well that was not the case. I felt that a lot of things have been left out. At the beginning, it was not as palpable as much as it was as I was reading further into it, but it reached a point where I could not ignore it anymore. Maybe the author did that on purpose, who knows? But I think since the book speaks about paradoxes that these points should not be left out. Another point is that he fails at comparing. He compares things together that... well cannot be compared together. Are you an idiot or what? Oh, and the author usually presents every chapter and paradox with an argument, and some of these arguments are very very poor. And in some points, I felt that the author failed at being objective. You are talking about PARADOXES, so when explaining the two points of view, you should NOT look biased, right? Well, his opinion generally matched mine, but that does NOT mean that I will ignore this point. the book then started boring me out except the last chapter which was really good. And I think the end was a really good end.
