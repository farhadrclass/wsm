So, in a way here I'm looking at the entire run of Bob Lee Swagger books. All in all, pretty good action reads, some a bit better than others. My favorite in the series is I, Sniper, the sixth in the series.Here we pick up after Bob has gotten through the events of the first two novels. He's still in sad shape, deep in the bottle struggling to hold on to life and not lose his wife and daughter whom he loves very much. Sadly in spite of that love his own personal demons are threatening to take everything away. Another struggle the family is having is that Bob has not been able to make a really good living and they are mostly getting by on Bob's retirement from the military.Then someone from Bob's past shows up, apparently the Russian sniper that wounded Bob in Vietnam has returned. He shoots a man he mistakes for Bob and then Bob's wife and almost his daughter...Bob has to come out of his funk or really lose everything he loves.The story here opens and about half the book takes place during the Vietnam war both in Nam and the U.S. The story moves forward and gives us some insight and more details on back story that we've known about since the first volume. This one moves along quickly with lots of action a good plot and more information filled in about our characters. Here we get a little more of a \"spy novel\" flavor than we have in most of the other Swagger novels and there's a twist at the end (though I suspect you'll see it coming). Not a bad book at all. I think I like the first 2 a bit better (and of course as I noted the 6th is my favorite, filled with action and good dollop of humor)in some ways but the look at the Vietnam era in this one is very real. Having lived through it I remember the confusion so many had, the pain, the loss.As noted pretty good book, I recommend it."}, {"userName": "Todd", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1763415-todd", "userReview": "My introduction to the author was this book.

The plot starts after the events of the last two books but we only get a short teaser into Bob's current life, a quick cliff-hanger before we jump back in time to the Vietnam War era. And once there, the POV shifts to Donny Fenn, a young marine who had been severely wounded during a tour in Vietnam but is now in Washington DC serving in a nice \"safe\" position. We get to watch him get drawn into the peace movement and be asked to spy on his fellow marines. His story is a poignant one and lasts for quite a while before he makes a courageous decision and is forced back to the warzone where he meets up with Bob Lee Swagger and becomes the master sniper's spotter. That section was quite lengthy, so much so that I was actually beginning to wonder if this was going to be a Swagger book at all. But from there it's all Swagger as we jump around in time to experience the larger plot. Utimately this serves to tie the entire story together and, at the same time, really fleshes out Bob Lee Swagger's backstory. We get to see cool sniping action as well as fall into a mystery/espionage plot and finish with an intense long range battle between two super sniper legends. Along the way we come to further understand the present day demons that Swagger endures and how they came to be."}, {"userName": "Nate", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6803829-nate", "userReview": "After a confusing but necessary slow start and setup this novel blasts into testosterone-laden overdrive with a retelling of Bob and Donny\u2019s epic stand at An Loc Valley in 1972 and then a gripping cat-and-mouse game in the present day.

It took a good 100 pages for the novel to become the latest form of addictive drug, but Hunter somehow built a hybrid of 'American Sniper' and 'Forrest Gump' that all but made me relive my days of living in Washington as a young USAF lieutenant in the mid-1970s. The iconic landmarks and lifestyle references made this damn book fit like your favorite jeans. The front half of the book leaves the reader feeling desperately sorry for poor Marine Corporal Donny Fenn, whose beautiful young wife becomes recycled as his boss' second wife. Hunter pulls this off smoothly because of the 58,000+ American boys that died in that nightmare, the ones left living had to redefine their lives somehow. This book could easily be the epitome of 'all is not as it appears.' In the cruelest twist of all, the hard ass Naval officer that sent Donny off to Vietnam for three months to be hunted like sporting game turns out to be the grand manipulator in the end--but I ain't spoiling it for ya. This novel's got all of the redneck frustration of a 100 country songs, but in this case the redneck-Swagger from Arkansas-is also a supremely intelligent animal. Here's the deal; if you liked Nelson DeMille's 'Up Country,' I WILL GUARANTEE you will love 'Time to Hunt.' Plain and simple, this is one of the 10 best books I've ever read, and that includes 500+ novels in the last five years alone. 'Time to Hunt' might not be up there with Stuart Woods' 'Chiefs' or Vince Flynn's 'Term Limits' but it's up there, believe me. Your only problem might be finding it, as 'Time to Hunt' was published in 1998, but it's worth the time and effort to find a copy, put on those comfortable jeans and prepare yourself for slowing down as you approach the end, not wanting the freaking action to end on ya. My word as an author--this book ROCKS!SPOILER PLOT SUMMARY FOLLOWS:Soviet Mole in Deep Cover. Washington, DC, in spring of 1971 was a war zone, or rather a war protesters' zone, with nearly continuous demonstrations against the ongoing war in Vietnam. Marine Corporal Donny Fenn, already having served a tour in The Land of Bad Things is assigned to the garrison at 8th & I Streets, part of a Funeral Company doing ceremonial burials at Arlington National Cemetery. His high school girl Julie is now a war demonstrator from Arizona and they meet, determined to complete their vows to one another to marry when possible. The Naval Investigative Service-long before Jethro Gibbs made it famous-is deeply involved in ferreting out the criminal aspects of the peaceniks, and extort Donny Fenn into going undercover to spy on one of his fellow grunts. He does so, meeting some heavies in the antiwar movement and is promised promotion for his testimony against Lance Corporal Ed Crowe. When the bust goes down, Fenn is branded the traitor by his fellow Marines, listens to Julie and Trig Carter-an antiwar Moses-and refuses to testify at Crowe's court martial. Washington Navy Yard NIS Head Ward Bonson goes hermatile, banishing Fenn to Vietnam even though he's got only 13 months left in his enlistment. Fenn meets and is taken under the wing of Bob the Nailer, the most terrifying of Marine snipers assigned to their Central Highlands AOR. As fate would have it, Donny survives assured death at Kham Duc, a special forces irregular camp near the Laotian border, backing SSGT Bob Swagger up as he disrupts and entire Division of NVA regulars heading to overrun Kham Duc. On his last day in country, Donny is killed by a Soviet sniper sent in to kill him, even though he and Swagger thought they'd killed Solaratov earlier. Swagger is hailed the hero but was shot thru the pelvis just before Donny bought it. After 2+ years of rehab he rejoins the Corps, his life a nightmare as bourbon is the only thing to ease his pain. After a few years he and Donny's widow Julie hook up, marry and have a daughter Nikki. Out riding the mountains one morning in Arizona, a sniper kills a neighbor riding with Julie and Nikki, then turns the gun on Julie, wounding but not killing her. In the subsequent investigation, Bob moves to Idaho to hide while he seeks out the sniper, who is the same Solaratov, just recycled by the KGB/SVR. Ultimately, Solaratov finds the hide ranch in Idaho and stakes it during a freak spring snow storm. Swagger, now in league with DDCI Ward Bonson, takes a HALO chute dive into the LZ, narrowly avoids death and finally kills Solaratov. In the debrief to this 'hunt,' it's Julie that Solaratov was after, as she was one of four people to identify Soviet deep cover spy Evgeny Pashin, now a star in post-Soviet Russia running for President. Pashin's involvement in the hit on Julie results in his own assassination and all is quiet. Swagger makes one last trip to Trig Carter's mother to tell her of his passing, and how he was not the target but a math student who'd developed math algorithms for satellite imagery. He finds Trig's last notes/drawings, which reveal Bonson as a contact of Pashin's in 1971. Using a claymore mine Bonson gave him for his hunt mission for Solaratov, Swagger confronts Bonson who confesses all, confident his five Spetsnaz guards will secure him. Swagger exits the warehouse the lone man standing and heads west."}, {"userName": "Nadia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6020312-nadia", "userReview": "It's as always with those books: first narrative flows slowly even lazily and then the last 100 pages plot is rushing and you have to pull an all-nighter cause you just can't put it down and not know if Swagger won.I finally came to conclusion that this is a detective stories where old sniper is playing a detective. First story was about himself, second was about his father and his death's secret and now it was time for Donny to tell his story. I wonder. So many things could have gone differently then in 70's but they didn't. And it was really sad to read about those events and know, that they will not end well. I bow before author cause you couldn't tell the moment they were going to die. More then once I was pretty sure that this was it. But it wasn't. And to be honest I skipped part where Swagger gets drunk to remember that morning. I just couldn't read it. Couldn't make myself to do that.Donny was so in love with Swagger. You could see that through the whole book. He idolized Swagger and put him on some kind of pedestal. I first thought that that's what killed him, but unless he hadn't been bitten and killed Solaratov that day... But even then there was a certainty that once at home some accident or another would happen to him. He was dead the moment the chose him to spy on his mates.The great pretender was almost perfect. I didn't suspect him until the end even though I had thought about the perfect cover story. But I'm glad that Bob Lee was smarter and had a rabbit in his hat. I think Swagger's file is marked R.E.D. in those archives of theirs. I also was sorry to see eagle go. It sounded like a great picture. And what also made me think was if that number on the check had any significance? Or was it just a random number? He could just tell \"They've got a check\" But he specified the sum up to the last cent... Well, nevermind."}, {"userName": "Rob Haug", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7450820-rob-haug", "userReview": "I am quickly becoming a Stephen Hunter fan. This is the fourth book I've read from Mr. Hunter, and probably the one I've enjoyed the most.There are no real spoilers here. The book starts with a man, woman, and child riding their horses towards a cliff edge to enjoy the view. A sniper, across the canyon, draws bead on them, and the man is blown out of the saddle. We then flash back to the end of 1971 and beginning of 1972. We finally get to hear the back story (spoiler alert if you haven't read previous novels) of how Bob Lee Swagger's spotter (and then husband to Swagger's now wife) gets killed. Forty percent of the novel tells this story. When we come back to the present, the who and why of the sniper shooting the group of horse riders seems obvious. It is anything but. This is great conspiracy story telling, especially as it doesn't really stretch the bounds of plausibility much. Additionally, Swagger is just a great hero, a moniker he constantly disdains. He is a man who is wired just a little differently than everyone else, which allows him to process information in a way that has him seeing trouble around every corner, and in Columbo-esque fashion, has him thinking ahead of his enemies.Hunter doesn't bog us down in detail, but I find the detail welcome. A great example is the Claymore mine that says \"This side toward enemy\". Swagger, a marine, figures this is helpful for the army.Very much looking forward to the next one."}, {"userName": "Tom Tischler", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5357814-tom-tischler", "userReview": "Twenty Five years after the end of the Vietnam War Bob \"The Nailer\" Swagger is back in the war zone.

I have now read the first four books in the Bob Lee series plus the World War 2 stand-alone MASTER SNIPER.. They are all page turners for sure. I had started reading (2010) these books with Book 4 - THE 47th SAMURAI - because of my interest in that Japanese legend. I just finished TIME TO HUNT (book 3 plus books 1 and 2 last fall) which gives a lot of the back story of Bob Lee Swagger, Julie (who was married to Donny Fenn then Bob Lee) and Donny Fenn, Bob Lee's spotter in Viet Nam in 1971-72.During the course of the story, which is like reading two separate books in one volume, the reader gets to meet Donny and Julie against the background of the peace movement in 1971 in Washington, D.C. Several other characters are introduced who show up 20 plus years later in the second part of the story. Hunter's descriptions of the peace movement of 40 years ago are right on. It feels like he was there himself. The story follows Donny as he is re-assigned to Viet Nam where he meets and befriends master sniper Bob Lee Swagger. Hunter describes the role of the Marine snipers in Viet Nam in great detail. Not for squeamish!After describing Donny's and Bob Lee's adventures in Viet Nam, the story moves forward twenty or so years to rural and mountainous East Central Idaho where Bob Lee and his family have been forced to move (from Arizona) because of the fallout from his activities in books 1 and 2 in the series. This is where characters from the 1970s resurface. Bob Lee is drawn into a major international conspiracy that could have a very adverse effect on life in the United States. The \"hunting\" scenes in Idaho are very well done. Bob Lee's relationship with his family reach a breaking point while he tries to resolve PTSD issues and more.While this is a work of fiction, there are some real incidents incorporated into the story. You can check them out via the Internet - I did. There was a movie a few years ago called THE SHOOTER and a recently completed first TV season called SHOOTER. Neither followed the books exactly but were close enough to make them good viewing. If you love these kinds of stories then I highly recommend the books to you. If you think you might like them, then by all means, read them. You will not be disappointed.GO! BUY!

I love books about snipers and sniping, fiction or fact, and I love Bob Lee. You might have seen the Mark Wallenberg movie 'Point of Impact' which did a decent job of a Swagger book - the book was better.Bob Lee was (and for part of this book is) a Marine sniper. The author describes him as 'the looks of Clint Eastwood and the voice of Gomer Pyle' - cute but Bob Lee has a laconic drawl which is quite unlike Gomer. This book starts in the days of the Vietnam War protests in Washingon, DC which had me wondering and not too engaged but this is essential for the book. It also fills in some of the blanks for us Bob Lee fans. The rest of the book is split between Vietnam and the US - Oregon and the DC area. Ironically, the Vietnam part is located in Da Nang, Hoi An, and Kham Duc - all places we'll be visiting next March! The Kham Duc part is what made Bob Lee the legend he became and fill in essential blanks in other books.The ending could have been better for me but didn't really detract.PS gave it 4.5 stars on Librarything."}, {"userName": "Russ Skinner", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13359687-russ-skinner", "userReview": "Moving back and forth through time in a book isn't something I am a fan of, but it works (for the most part) here.I enjoyed the author's acknowledgement at the end that there were inconsistencies between this and earlier books in the series, but it was a good read, with only a bit of manipulation obvious.I will be continuing with this series, after a pause to catch up with other titles/series."}, {"userName": "Ron Holmes", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2465991-ron-holmes", "userReview": "This is the third book in the series of the Swaggers.

He only wants to live in peace with his family, and forget the war that nearly killed him...It's not going to happen.Stephen Hunter's epic national bestsellers, Point of Impact and Black Light, introduced millions of readers to Bob Lee Swagger, called \"Bob the Nailer,\" a heroic but flawed Vietnam War veteran forced twice to use his skills as a master sniper to defend his life and his honor. Now, in his grandest, most intensely thrilling adventure yet, Bob the Nailer must face his deadliest foe from Vietnam--and his own demons--to save his wife and daughter.During the latter days of the Vietnam War, deep in-country, a young idealistic Marine named Donny Fenn was cut down by a sniper's bullet as he set out on patrol with Swagger, who himself received a grievous wound. Years later Swagger married Donny's widow, Julie, and together they raise their daughter, Nikki, on a ranch in the isolated Sawtooth Mountains in Idaho. Although he struggles with the painful legacy of Vietnam, Swagger's greatest wish--to leave his violent past behind and live quietly with his family--seems to have come true.Then one idyllic day, a man, a woman, and a girl set out from the ranch on horseback. High on a ridge above a mountain pass, a thousand yards distant, a calm, cold-eyed shooter, one of the world's greatest marksmen, peers through a telescopic sight at the three approaching figures.Out of his tortured past, a mortal enemy has once again found Bob the Nailer.
