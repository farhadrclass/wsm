Heroine is not complimented on how delicious her blood smells. Instead, she is told that her ass looks like two ripe melons. Just what every woman wants.9. When the hero has to rescue the heroine, he doesn't merely have to run at lightning speed across the parking lot. He actually has to travel halfway across the world, kill a few dozen villains, and blow up a few buildings.8. But that doesn't matter because just as often the heroine can rescue her own damn self.7. Pirates are WAY better than vampires.6. The creepy, obsessive dude is an actual villain and not the hero of the story.5. The denouement involves actual danger, as opposed to what essentially amounts to a Rainbow Gathering gone awry.4. The doctor doesn't come off as a pedophile.3.

She said that there were four story lines (hence the four points on the Caltrop on the cover) and I was excited at first. But when I got into the story, I got bored with the overlong passages about William and John's intrigues. Where were Jamie and Claire?? (And why the hell can't they manage a sea voyage without trouble??) I actually started to wish I could read about Brianna (one of my least favorite people...)I heard her say there was going to be another book after this one (the ongoing belief was that this book was going to be the last one) which is very apparent after this book that there has to be one more. But I feel like if she had cut half of the story out and finished the cliffhanging story lines, she could be done by now, and I could have peace of mind knowing the story is over! I mean I really don't appreciate being led on for 2/3 of a book and then have four different surprise endings.Some other smaller points:-felt choppy-dragged at points and then skipped over more interesting points-not enough Jamie and Claire!!! I'm going to read it again more slowly to see if my opinion changes, but first I need to let the dust settle on my disappointment.**EDIT**OK, So I've had some time to sit and ruminate on the experience of this book and why I couldn't pinpoint the niggling reason (like bothering a sore tooth with your tongue) why I was so disappointed. There were the shallow obvious reasons of course, like four surprise endings, but deeper still ran something vague and unnameable until now. See, as silly as it sounds, I became emotionally invested in the characters and stories of Jamie and Claire, and rightly so, a good book should make you care about its characters. Being a typical DG fangirl, I've read all the Outlander novels without much complaint, and re-read, and re-read, and re-read. I don't think I can do that with this book. I think there are about 100 pages I'd be willing to go through again. So yeah, I'm angry that I don't have another book to keep re-reading, as psycho as it sounds. I'm not really sure if I should be angry at Diana Gabaldon, her editor, her publisher, or anyone else who read this book before it went to press and didn't tell her she needed to get a pair of proverbial scissors. Of course I'll be getting the next and hopefully last book, but with a lesser amount of trust and a greater wariness."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "Bloody hell, I'm freaking tired!So here's the deal. Most of my friends here on Goodreads know that I have been listening to these cd's from the library. Well, I just happened to check the status of their return because I should have had one more month for them to be renewed. Noooooooooooooooooo, on this book someone placed a hold and it's due soon so luckily I started listening to it a few days ago, but now I'm freaking tired because I have had to listen almost non stop while reading another book. Not much sleep. I do not like to listen to audio books for that long even if I LOVE the narrator! Anyhoo, I'm done and I can take my time with the next audio =) I didn't like this book as much as the other ones and it didn't even make my favorites list! =( All the other books are 5 star favorites. Oh well =(I don't like that the family is all broken up and in different places and of course Bree, Roger and the kids are back in the real time world. I must have missed the explanation at the beginning because Bree and Roger are able to read letters from Claire and Jamie. I don't get it and I'm not going to look for it. Oh, there was a book though that was written by Jamie, gave me a little tear in my eye when Roger read it. \nGrandfather Tales, the book was titled, with the subtitle, \"Stories from the Highlands of Scotland and the Backcountry of the Carolinas,\" by James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser. Again, printed by A. Bell, Edinburgh, in the same year. The dedication said simply, For my grandchildren. Claire's portrait had made him laugh; this one moved him almost to tears, and he closed the book gently.\nThat was Roger that read that and he had seen a picture of Claire. Bree and Roger live in Lallybroch. I reckon they fixed it up all nice. It just breaks my heart. William (Jamie's son) is in the book more, what with him in the war and all. Jamie and Claire go back to Scotland after awhile and we get to meet up with some of the old characters, Jenny, Ian and the kids, who are grown up. And there is a death. And of course, on their way back to Scotland they get attacked by pirates and such again. Just stay off the freaking waters! Fergus and the gang are in the book a little bit. But, there is some crap that goes down at the end that I hated! It makes me sick and I want to drop kick Lord John Grey!!! Just grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. I'm hoping the next book is better than this one and I can get back to loving them or I'm going to kick something! I'm not listening to it right away though because, uh, I'm done listening for a little while after this one!

I'd probably have given five stars to anything that wasn't a huge disappointment. Which this wasn't, of course; I thought it was quite good.The first couple hundred pages are admittedly a little slow. We get a lot of POV from Lord John and 19-yr-old William, and there is some crossover from the LJ spin-off series, which I think may be confusing for people who haven't read those books. I like John and William very much, but in this series I really want to read about Jamie and Claire and fortunately the book soon begins to focus more on them.The last hundred pages are riveting and really quite shocking. But after the earlier slow pacing they felt a little rushed, and the ending is abrupt. It was made worse because I didn't realize that there is an author's note at the end, so the story stopped suddenly when I thought there were still a few pages to go! If I weren't such a fangirl I would probably dock the book a star for concluding with multiple dramatic cliffhangers, which I in general dislike. I don't remember the other books in this series leaving us hanging in mid-scene! There are also some storylines left unresolved, so even at 800+ pages this felt like the first half of an extremely long novel.But *dreamy sigh* the book thrilled me anyway. Gabaldon claims to write in scenes, and when I re-read these books I do tend to skim some of the connecting narrative and focus on my favorite scenes, and there are plenty of new favorites in this one. Claire's medical work is as fascinating as always, particularly a long sequence which I had already read as an excerpt in The Outlandish Companion."}, {"userName": "Mo", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11856352-mo", "userReview": "\u201dGod, your arse looks fine, wi\u2019 the wet linen of your shift clinging to it, it goes all transparent, and I can see the weight of your buttocks, like great smooth round melons ...\"\nI sort of wondered when I started this book if I was going into Outlander overload and that I might tire of it seeing as I have read 6 of the books in the space of 2 months or so.No, this book was wonderful, for the most part.

Why not just have her commit suicide as she tried to but didn\u2019t ? Or have Claire take a mental vacay from reality for as long as she believed Jamie was 6-FT under ? Good grief. What\u2019s the purpose of this plot device aka her momentary insanity ? Just to add more dwamatic flavor into the BOILING cauldron ? Jamie\u2019s not even cold in his grave yet. Ick. How could she even think, let alone do Lord John ? Is this a potentially awkward luv triangle since he has feelings for Jamie too ? What a tangled web.-\tWhat\u2019s up w/ Jamie\u2019s mild reaction when Lord John fessed up that he had carnal knowledge of Claire ? Oh wait, I forgot, this book only serves as a stepping stone for the next installment -\tWas DG sprinting to meet the deadline ? Was she watching Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 when she wrote this epic saga ? As if we\u2019re not poor enough w/ the econ in the dumpster as it is. If I\u2019d forked over big bucks outta my own negative piggy bank, I\u2019d have demanded a half-refund. Good thing I used a library card, not a CC.-\tBuccleigh = Another TT victim.

Haven\u2019t I seen Claire stitch up Jamie before ? Ok so this time she\u2019s severing a full digit & trying to leave him w/ a working hand. I don\u2019t think my poor fragile heart can take any more abuse than this. How many more lives does Jamie have left ? Have mercy.-\tWhen Willie met Jamie. If that\u2019s all there is to it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth waiting for. It\u2019s supposed to build up like a crescendo \u2018till the moment of truth hits him in the face. It got swallowed up by the impending troops. I expected a so much more electrifying reunion. -\tCan Lord John & Willie\u2019s storylines be any more boring ? Wish their tedious episodes coulda been condensed into merely 1 \u2013 2 chapters. Or @ least, keep them in separate sections instead of sneaking them in-between Jamie, Ian, Claire, Rog & Bree\u2019s perilous adventures. It\u2019s too crowded. If U wanna include \u2018em, @ least give us more substance to root for. My head\u2019s still spinning from the subplot overload. Wonder why my short-span attention drifted to other books. I thought I could recharge my interest but it didn\u2019t work =^B-\tI didn\u2019t care much for Rog & Bree\u2019s modern life in the 1980\u2019s either, hence the 2 stars I dinged on. Just get over it. Their kids were way more riveting & if it weren\u2019t for Mandy\u2019s acute sense of loss, Rog & Bree wouldn\u2019t have known Jem was missing. No wonder they say kids have a 6th sense. For a moment there I felt like in a twilight zone.-\tThe letters that Bree & Roger read, actually made my eyes kinda glaze over. They\u2019re small & in italics, plus my eyesight is failing, the letters made me drowsy. I was torn between skipping them & not wanting to miss anything pertaining to Jaime & Claire\u2019s adventures.-\tLotsa v. dull sea voyage scenes. Here I am, a fan of swashbuckling pirate romance, I wanted them to get off the ship & land somewhere.-\tThe diminishing # of Jamie-ism. @ my rapidly-advancing age, I need more to sustain me thru\u2019 the next 4 yrs. He still said the most luvly, aaawww-worthy lines to Claire but they\u2019re too far & few between =^DFav (some gut-wrenching) moments :-\tClaire, like a loose cannon, gave Jamie a delish dressing-down after seeing his injury-decorated self. Almost had a cardiac arrest when the scavenger duo were gonna kill him. @$$-kicking heroine that she is, Claire got the biggest b@ll$ when it comes to protecting Jamie. -\tJamie\u2019s death-defying, gritty battle scenes. I prayed \u2013 and this is coming from an unbeliever \u2013 that Jamie would not get blown away to splinters like his comrades. In the scene where Claire found him later on, he bared his soul to her \u2018bout his motives & principles in joining the revolution. Fell in luv w/ him all over again, what an amazing guy.-\tIan\u2019s bloody slow death of consumption was heart-breaking. Luved that poignant scene where Jamie offered his severed finger to Ian. He\u2019ll always keep a part of Jamie w/ him to next life. Now that\u2019s what U\u2019d call a true BFF. -\tYoung Ian got to see his da & family. He spent quality time w/ da & revealed that he\u2019s in luv. Ian can go peacefully, knowing that his son got another shot @ HEA. -\tJenny & Claire butted heads again, as expected. Their volatile relationship might keep things interesting in the next 1.-\tJamie & Claire took matters in their own hands, literally. His sweaty, outraged reaction to Claire\u2019s request to \u201cluv thyself\u201d was comical =P Why didn\u2019t we get more lovey-dovey scenes ? The freakin-hawt chemistry was still alive & kicking. Instead, we\u2019re treated to various symptoms of fatigue, exhaustion, vomiting, thirst, starvation etc. Granted, it\u2019s wartime & they gotta conserve their energy, but the romance dept woulda benefited w/ more J & C\u2019s inspiring luv scenes.-\tJamie & Laoghaire\u2019s long-overdue explosive reunion. @ least they got to settle it once & for all. Laoghaire found happiness in an unlikely man, who needed her more than Jamie ever did. Li\u2019l Joanie was all grown-up now & made an overture to Jamie to pave her way to the convent. Claire had the upper hand when she made a bargain w/ Laoghaire, who needed her medical skills for Marsali\u2019s kid. 1 dilemma\u2019s solved.-\tYoung Ian had a secret son, fell head over heels in luv w/ a Quaker. It\u2019s kinda confusing reading Rachel & Denny Hunters\u2019 weird lingo.-\tDenny & Dottie, Ian & Rachel = I liked their sweet 2ndary romance.-\tIan\u2019s devotion to his mutt, Rollo. I\u2019m a sucka for heroes who adore dogs. Ian has become my 2nd fav character in the ginormous clan. He felt so anguished over the accidental killing of Arch Bug\u2019s wife. @ last he showed fine mettle, esp when Jamie\u2019s being blackmailed by a scumbag & also in the final confrontation to save Rachel. I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing more of their conflicts in the next installment. It\u2019ll be fascinating to see the adjustments on both ends.-\tJamie saw Simon, his 2nd cousin, from the opposing end. Didn\u2019t wanna kill his kinsman but ended up almost shooting his own son Willie in the head. Jamie met his other cousin, Hamish, it\u2019s a small world indeed. I wonder how many more cousins Jamie\u2019ll encounter.-\tLiked Fergus & his mysterious lineage plot. I wouldn\u2019t have minded @ all if DG had included more of his scenes w/ Jamie than the dull Lord John & Willie\u2019s encounters.-\tTom Christie returned, much to Claire\u2019s discomfort \u2018cuz he still carried a flaming torch for her.-\tDG\u2019s wonderful dialogues. Just can\u2019t get enuff of \u2018em. If her editor hadn\u2019t fallen asleep, methinks the book coulda been more condensed into 500 pages. Get rid of the yawn-inducing segments like LJ & Willie, they should be relegated to the farthest corner of the storyboard. Same w/ Rog & Bree, they should be placed in the back burner, tho\u2019 I still wanna know whatever happened to li\u2019l Jem & how Cameron will succeed in making Bree show him the much-coveted treasure, I\u2019m more keen on reading J & C, plus young Ian & Rachel. I want more crunchy moments between Jamie & Willie, as everyone w/ eyes can see their striking resemblance. I still luved her characters\u2019 dynamics but I preferred a tighter pacing & more resolutions to dangling threads than just the daily occurrences. 4 years is helluva long time to wait."}, {"userName": "LJ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/250195-lj", "userReview": "First Sentence: The pirate's head had disappeared.In this 7th book to the Outlander series, Jamie, Claire and Ian are leaving the Ridge headed for Scotland to take Ian back to his family and bring Jamie's printing press back to the Colonies. Roger and Brianna have returned to the present and have settled at Lallybroch, but they've not completely left the past behind. William is anxious to prove himself in battle and Lord John is dealing with his family, both in England and in Pennsylvania.I was both delighted and disgusted with this book. Either way, it is clear Ms. Gabaldon (1) rushed the ending and (2) does not have a continuity editor. The story was so rife with coincidence as to almost be humorous. There were so many characters with significant stories it diluted each of the stories. However, there were also historical characters whose presence may have added a veracity to the period but added little to the story.Jamie and Claire are the focal point of the series. You'd never know that from this book where we jump between Jamie and Claire, Roger and Brianna, Lord John, William, and Denny and Rachael Hunter. The continual jumps in time and focus felt more as though it was bad episodic television than reading what should have been a wonderfully engrossing novel. In addition, there were inaccuracies and terrible inconsistencies that should have been caught. What makes it difficult is that, in essence I did like the book. There were scenes which touched my heart and even brought tears to my eyes. Gabaldon is very good at tugging the heartstrings. There were scenes of suspense and humor. However, there were also scenes where critically important information was being conveyed among the characters, but the reader was exited from the scene. All the scenes were so scattered throughout the story, it caused the pacing to be very uneven. ...and the ending; I am loathe to even mention the ending. To say it felt rushed would be kind. To say there were more story threads left dangling than a cat playing in a yarn basket would be an understatement. To say it was frustrating and extremely disappointing does not strongly enough express my feelings toward the ending.Were Ms. Gabaldon a poor writer, I could dismiss all this and walk away, but she is not. I have absolutely loved all the previous books in this series; yes, even Fiery Cross. She has created characters about whom I care and have taken to my hearts. She has created a story in which I am invested both in time--both in reading time alone and in the number of years this series has been part of my life--and in money--I own the books in hardcover, trade paperback and the audio books. Ms. Gabaldon is, apparently, going to fix some of the mistakes found in the hardcover edition of this book prior to the trade paperback edition being released. That's all well and good, but it still leaves those of us with the hardcover edition, particularly where I bought 6 signed copies at full price, with error-laden books. I should have much preferred the errors be caught and corrected in the first place.I shall continue with the series as these characters are now part of my life and I really want to know where the story goes. However, I do feel Ms. Gabaldon has a responsibility, both to herself and to her very faithful legion of fans, to spend more time and do a better job on Book 8."}, {"userName": "Jacqie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2133111-jacqie", "userReview": "So I love Diana Gabaldon. I wish she would write faster than one new book every four years in the Outlander series, but whatcha gonna do. So Of course I've been waiting with bated breath for this one. Writing: still draws you into the characters' lives. They are so human, so loving, so flawed yet continuously striving.Characters: this book has four main plots (yes, four). We get Jamie and Claire, but we also get Ian (who I like to read about), Roger and Brianna (who I found annoying earlier in the series but now really am enjoying), and William and Lord John. That last plot thread really plods. I don't get the sense of empathy with these two characters that I can get with the others. There's lots of plotting and intrigue that really doesn't amount to much. I think the author is a frustrated mystery writer, but the mystery parts of her books don't do nearly as much for me as the time travel, romances, adventure, history, and humor. Plot: I don't know if I can forgive her for this. She wrote a great book and then failed to end it. Three of the four plots threads end with characters in terrible danger or a major unresolved issue. Why would she do this? In a book that's 800 pages long, it's not like she worries much about editing. Couldn't she write another 50 to 100 pages and get them out of those messes? The cliffhangers are ridiculous when we will probably have to wait another 4 years to see them resolved. No matter how much tension she generates, four years will make it die down.

Well lots of POV's to start! We get Claire, Jamie, Brianna, Roger, Ian, John, William, and so much more! This made me so happy because I was kind of getting sick of reading from Claire's POV. Not that I hate the girl or anything.. but it was getting annoying and boring. Unfortunately, I was kind of getting annoyed with Brianna's POV because it was like reading from Claire's...There is adventure in here too.

The author has another series of books based on a minor character from this series. This is the first time in the Outlander series that I felt lost because I hadn't read the Lord John series. Annoying.2. Because so much time was spent developing this secondary story line, the main characters get the shaft. More than annoying.There were a few other things that annoyed me (too much war/battle details - yawn, THE ENDING WAS CRAZY) but that I think will bother me less upon a second reading.Yes, I read these books multiple times. Did I mention that I love Jamie?"}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/316422-lynn", "userReview": "After several thousand pages of build-up, the Revolutionary War is finally here \u2014 and with it, the excitement of the early Outlander novels returns. No offense to the residents of Fraser's Ridge, but it's a lot more fun to see Jamie and Claire interacting with Benedict Arnold than Hiram Crombie. They may be older and wiser than they were back in the Dragonfly in Amber and Voyager days, but this book has more in common with those two novels than it does with the last few that preceded it. I can't help but feel that the Frasers are back in their element; a life of quiet domesticity may just not be their thing.What else can I say about Echo? Several characters and storylines from the early books (and even the Lord John series) return, but several new, very likeable characters are introduced as well. There were enough twists, turns, and mysteries to keep me glued to the pages... and I hope it won't take forever for the next Outlander book to come out because quite a few surprises happen late in this one and don't get resolved before the end."}, {"userName": "Claudia B", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2467233-claudia-b", "userReview": "And this is it for me and the Outlander series.There is a section in the Outlandish Companion where Diana talks about authors who do so much research and then make their readers \"pay\" for it. Meaning, if the author read about it, she's going to put it in the book, regardless of how much it contributes to the actual story. I think that Diana is now doing the same. I've been a loyal fan of hers since I first read Outlander, but I'm done. I can't deal with an endless series where just because she's now researching the whole damn War of Independence we need to find out about what a soldier's buttons say or whatever the next cute bit of minutiae she stumbled upon.I don't feel like \"paying\" for it anymore. I didn't even buy this book because I was so wary of how it would turn out, and it was pretty much as I'd dreaded. Chapter upon chapter filled with hundreds of characters I don't even care about. I don't think I'll even request the future books from the library. Yes, books, because honestly, this whole scam of \"oh, just one more book\" has worn me out. First it was a trilogy; then it was six books, three for the Uprising and three for the New World; oh wait, it was eight books - oh, Diana just keeps finding more stuff to string us along.I've already abandoned one series where I got tired of the author writing for herself - the Anita Blake series - and now I'm sad that I'm done with the Outlander series. If I'm still alive when the last book in the series comes out, I'll go to Borders and see how it ended, but I won't pay with my money or my time any more."}, {"userName": "Sharon \u221e\u2765 is an emotional book junkie \u2765\u221e ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3275325-sharon-is-an-emotional-book-junkie", "userReview": "4.5 \u2605'sThere's really no way to do a review without spoilers so I'm just going to write down some thoughts.Wow...I really can't believe I'm finally at this point - being all caught up with the Outlander books. I've always heard how everyone loves them but the sheer size of them is just scary! However, they are definitely an adventure not to be missed. I decided to let myself kick back and enjoy them and enjoy them I did. What a treat! I loved getting to know all these characters...loving some of them, hating the others and some I was seriously surprised at how much I came to like. Diana Gabaldon doesn't do anything half way and I guess that explains why the books are taking so long to write now. I'm thankful that I don't have to wait four years for the next one but I'll be with you guys for the ones after that. I think that's the main problem with her books. Everything is in such detail and it makes you feel like you are literally there. Whenever she writes about lice, I swear I'm itchy for days! I'm not a big fan of wars and tales about the Indians and medical procedures but I do have to say that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. In fact, I've probably learned a few things here and there. The bad part is that there is no way to remember everything that has happened! I feel for the most part that she does a good job catching you back up because I'm not sure I could read these all again...not for a while!Sooo...some thoughts on the book: I LOVE Jamie and Claire and I can't imagine that ever changing. Their love story is truly the heart of the book and I don't ever want to think of that ending! Some parts of this book made me hesitate though and one part at the end that was left unresolved has me worried! Roger, Brianne, Jem and Amanda hold a special place for me as well. I love hearing about the 'connection' between Jem and Mandy but I can't believe what happened!! At that point, I was thankful for William MacKenzie but I'm still worried about Roger. I really enjoyed getting to know Willie better. All the hits and misses were great but the ending was crazy and my mind is going a million different directions on what DG will come up with.I loved everything about Ian even though Arch Bug gave it a whole creepy factor. I'm so happy about Rachel...I really hope we get some happiness there. And of course, Rollo helped save the day!It was great when Jamie and Claire went back to Lallybroch. I was hoping things would settle better between Claire and Jenny and they still might. Things were really sad about Ian (Sr.) but I thought the part with Jamie's finger was really touching. I didn't like anything about Laoghaire but I was glad that things seemed to work out for everyone. There are sooo many other characters that it would take forever to touch on everyone and every event. There are a lot of touching and sweet moments that I really enjoyed such as Jamie and Claire getting glasses! I thought that was great! And don't even get me started on Tom Christie! I had read the blurb for the next book so thankfully I wasn't terribly upset when certain events happened. I'm just glad that the things I thought were spoilers were addressed in this book...that would have been terrible to be left hanging from those events! Can Fall 2013 get here any faster?Favorite quotes:\u2665 \"I canna think of yea dead, Claire. Anything else--but not that. I can't.\"\u2665 \u201cBut ye couldna weep for the bairns. Or the house.

Sorry, Diana, but the characters are tired, there are many new characters I found hard to keep track of, and the few that reappeared seem to come back suddenly then leave just as quickly, all so that loose end could be tied up. I found myself asking: \"Who is ___ again? \" upon the first chapter and I totally skimmed through any of Lord Grey's appearances. I didn't like his standalone books and felt she was trying to insert him into the \"Outlander\" series as a major character. The only parts I read word for word were Brianna and Roger and most of the last 1/4 of the book b/c I was told, \"Read the last 100 pages.\" The action picked up quite a bit during the last 1/4 but then stopped suddenly like I hit a wall. There are many loose ends that are tied up but just as many that are left untied. I found contridictions in characters and some of the decisions they made ( *SPOILER* --------------------like the reason Claire went back to the US; why would Claire sleep with someone so soon after she thought Jamie was dead) weren't true to their character.

I have now made it through seven books of this series, which is basically like twenty-one normal-sized books, or fourteen above average-sized ones. All this to say I HAVE DONE HARD WORK NOW GIVE ME TACOS. I was going to type \"cookies\", but dammit I really want some tacos right now. Also, on the last Jane the Virgin episode, I was introduced to the concept of the Venezuelan miracle food, the arepa, and I am now obsessed with trying one, except there's only one Venezuelan eatery in my city, and it's a food truck and FOOD TRUCKS MOVE YOU GUYS. This will be my project for 2017. Tracking down an arepa and eating it so hard. Quite possibly trying all the arepas they have. Unless I hate arepas and then I will stop after one. (This is not likely.)So this book was good! It still took me about two months to read, but that's because I read the first 300-ish pages and then put it down for two months because I got distracted by shiny things like a damn raccoon. I finished the last 800 pages in about three days when I finally picked it back up. We still haven't reached the level of interest and engagement I had when reading books 1-3, but this was at least Drums of Autumn-level engagement. I think I just have to come to terms with the fact that DG will never again write a book with as much narrative tension as she did with Voyager (still my favorite of the series so far).There's still some bloat here, which accounts for why I was able to put it down for so long without feeling a real need to pick it back up again. I appreciate that she wants Jamie's illegitimate son William to be a more fleshed out character, but what he gets up to in this book isn't really super engaging. His most interesting moments come when he's interacting with characters we already know and love (Bree, Ian, Lord John). The first third of this was somewhat interesting, but really a lot of it could have been cut out, especially since I thought the last hundred pages (full of some really important happenings) was rushed. I would have liked more lingering on some of that stuff, which was really emotional.The stage is set for an interesting eighth book, though, and my interest in this series has definitely been re-engaged. I'd been told this would happen if I could just get through books five and six, but it's a relief to have it confirmed. I like liking this series. I don't like thinking it's a slog. So yes, people, if you're reading this and wondering if there is a light at the end of the tunnel that is Outlander, I will say to you, yes. Keep going!Not sure when I'll get to the next one. I'm tempted to save it for closer to either the release of season three of the show or closer to the release date of the ninth book.

So it's no real surprise that it took me a while to get into this one, and that I didn't remember all of the characters referenced throughout. But I will say that I got the impression Gabaldon was writing this book with more than her Outlander readers in mind; the focus on Lord John and his espionage career smacked of crossover. Which I didn't really love, but I can respect her making a play to get more readers for those books.The book is choppier than some of her previous ones, and I believe that if I read it again I'll skip all of the Bree and Roger bits to get to more Claire and Jamie (like how you skip all of the Frodo and Sam scenes in The Two Towers), at least for the first half of the book. But by the end I really only wanted to know what would happen to Ian, and to a lesser extent William. Also she seems to be getting a bit far afield with the allusions to Roger Mac's dad disappearing in time and then Buccleigh showing up in the 20th century. At a certain point time travel loses its mystique when you've got every single character doing it at some point in the series!

Thank goodness I took it out from the library and didn't waste my money or shelf space on it. Obviously I am quite disappointed in this latest installment of Jamie and Claire, because there is so little of interest happening between of these two. I agree with another reviewer that I couldn't remember who 80% of the plethora of characters in the book were (and she didn't refresh us), and adding a whole host more made it even muddier.. Add in the back and forth thing... no thanks. I think that the series started going downhill with the Revolutionary War, and I stand by that.

Of course this _is_ Jamie and Claire we're talking about so there is no smooth sailing and the *road* to Scotland is mired with many side-trips and detours as well. Roger and Bree have returned to the present and settled into life at Lallybroch, although they're also in for a few twists and turns and bumps in the night as well. William is now an adult and an officer in the British army and we see quite a bit more of him - will he and Jamie ever meet face to face? Who is the mysterious man searching for Fergus and what secrets might he reveal about his birth parents? You'll find new friends among the old from the previous books (and a couple of very surprising returns), although IMHO there are waaaaay too many new friends as well as waaaay too much of Lord John and characters from his books. I'm not that fond of Lord John as a major character and that's why I didn't read the books to begin with and consider it dirty pool to muck up Jamie and Claire's story with Lord John\u2019s, particularly that little plot twist at the end. Eww ewww ewww ewww ewww. Diana, how could you?In the end, I'm wondering if I've changed as a reader, or has Gabaldon changed and/or got a bit sloppy? I've heard many complain about her going on in too much detail in the other books but I was so enraptured with them I wouldn't have wanted to have seen one word edited out. Not so here, the story just rambles on and on with needless plot twists and characters that go nowhere (for shame what she did with Benjamin Franklin), and as for the overly verbose details - I did not need to know every minute detail of every medical procedure performed by Claire and most especially not the removal of Jamie's finger. Worst of all, was the constantly switching point of views (I believe there are seven) leading to a very uneven, choppy flow and I was always able to put this down and walk away from it - frankly half way through I started another book and finished that before coming back to Echo. Cut a good chunk of the first 2/3 of the book out and flesh out the last and keep it moving a bit more instead of ending it as she did with those maddening cliff-hangers this would be a solid five star read.

And still more to come!!!!What a ride this has been!!!! It has taken me half a year, yes 6 months to get through this fabulous series. I embarked on my quest of audio books back in July of 2013, and I have finally reached the end of my journey... so far, as there will be another book out in the series later this year. AND.... a TV mini-series on STARZ\u00a9 airing in March 2014!!!!!! Words can not express my love for this series, and my devotion to the author. They will always hold a special place in my heart. I have truly come to fall in love with the characters and their stories. I feel like I have been living their lives right along with them, experiencing the pains and joys of their lives as if they were my own. I also have to mention that I am in awe of the level of research and preparation that has been put into these books. While I know they are fiction, they are set in within history. Using the real events of the times to play into the drama of the character's daily lives. And quite educational at that. In fact they have sparked my interest in World and American History causing me to seek out other references to the real life accounts of these historical events. I am not going to go into specifics of the story in this review, as this story is on-going from book to book, and it is difficult to rate one segment of someone's life as better than the rest. Yes, I do have my favorite segments of the story... but they are all part of a bigger picture in my mind, like one giant book. That is why I gave them all the same rating. And the story in not finished. There are still many questions left unanswered, and events in progress. And for an author to capture your interest for this long.. and keep it peaked, is amazing in itself.Lastly, I just want to mention the narrator of these audio books. I chose to read these via audio because I didn't want to take up all of my reading time with such lengthy tomes. And they are LENGTHY!!!! Even the audio books take a good bit of time. But I can listen while doing other things, which makes it easier for me to get through longer texts without hassle. I also realized that many times a narrator can either make or break an audio book for the reader. Well, in this case, Devina Porter, the narrator of this series completely MADE the story come to life for me. She has been my constant companion for 6 months now, and I will miss spending time with her each day. Her accents and acting ability baffles the mind. And her ability to create and distinguish characters, both male and female, English, Scottish, Irish, American, and even African slave has completely BLOWN MY MIND!!!!! BRAVO Ms. Porter, and thank you for bringing this story to life in such a memorable way!!!! I highly recommend these audio books to anyone wishing to take on this series, but is wary due to it's mere length. You will not be disappointed. Well I've said more than I intended. The next book.. Written in My Own Heart's Blood will be released on June 10 2014, according to the author's website. And the TV series on STARZ is set to start in March 2014!!!! These books will be on my all time favorites list for all time!!!!! 5 STARS for the OUTLANDER SERIES!!!!!!!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Jeannie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18024484-jeannie", "userReview": "This took me forever to read! I almost gave up, the first half of the book is mostly about William and parts were boring. I wanted more Jamie and Claire!I'm glad I stuck with it, the second half was great! I look forward to the next one."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2669490-kimberly", "userReview": "[1. I'm not sure if I like the character of Rachel Hunter (I can't help thinking of the model, haha). For now, I'm keeping an open mind to see how her character develops and if she is fleshed out more in the next book. She is a bit one-dimensional at this point. Maybe I'm critical though because I love Ian so much and have high standards for him.2. I felt like I was missing some references and nuances to certain characters because I haven't read the Lord John books yet. I'm definitely going to be picking those up soon so the next time I read Echo (yes, I'm already planning a re-read of the whole series because I'm that obsessed, haha) I will hopefully be more educated about the background of the characters from those stories. That being said, I could have dealt with a little less Lord John (as much as I enjoy him) and a little more Jamie in certain parts.3. The whole Lord John--Jamie--Claire triangle was almost unbelievable. Claire should have realized that communication was spotty at best during that time and that there was a real possibility Jamie wasn't on the ship. *sigh* I should have seen the foreshadowing with the Jamie and Laoghaire interaction earlier in Echo. Anyway, I guess we will see how the drama is resolved in the next book. I fully believe that all will be well with Jamie and Claire though, because I can't imagine Diana writing a whole book with them at odds with each other.Now for the good stuff!!! I was so sad when Ian died. I definitely shed a few tears reading those scenes. I loved that Willie found out Jamie was his father. Loved that Roger and Briana are all settled in at Lallybroch (well, maybe WERE settled). Loved young Ian and Rollo as usual. Loved all the Claire/Jamie interaction. I could go on and on...
