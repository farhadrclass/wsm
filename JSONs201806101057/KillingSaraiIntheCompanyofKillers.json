THERE IS NO CLICKING OUR HEELS TO GET OUT! THIS IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WORLD!Two people driven by their circumstances.Two people who are products of their environment.Brought together by fate, perhaps? Or, maybe....just a shitty happenstance.\n....it feels like a hundred drunk butterflies are having an orgy in my stomach.\nWhy, yes it does!Killing Sarai by J.A. Redmerski will leave you on the edge of your seat, panting and gripping your e-reader with a vice grip so strong that it\u2019s a wonder you don\u2019t break it. This book is violent, gritty, raw, real, dark and passionate. There is no prince charming. There is no princess awaiting rescue. Trust no one. Serve only yourself and your interests. Always look over your shoulder. The major players....Victor:\nI am discipline. Sarai is rage.\nSarai:\nBeautiful, but defeated and damaged. Damaged for the rest of her life and no amount of emotional mutilation will ever fully give her back her innocence.\nSarai has been a prisoner and at the mercy of a Mexican drug dealer for nine long years, essentially since the age of fourteen. Abandoned by her own mother who gave her to the said drug lord, Sarai\u2019s life has been nothing but violence, abuse, obsession, seclusion and slavery. Escape would mean suicide. There is no one to help her. No one to help her escape. When an American man comes to the compound to deal, Sarai sees her chance at escape. She knows that her freedom may come with a price, but she is willing to take the chance. She is not willing to live the life she has been enduring any longer. Desperate times call for desperate measures.With a loaded gun and a ballsy attitude, Sarai stows away in the back of the American\u2019s car. Once Sarai is discovered in the vehicle, she quickly determines that despite having a gun pointed at the emotionless and stoic man, she is not the one in control. Her demands to be taken into the United States mean nothing to this ruthless and cold-blooded killer for hire. The American assassin has business to conduct and he will not let this young women ruin his plans. However, Victor finds himself intrigued by Sarai and decides to let her stay with him for the time being \u2013 whether this was his conscience or his need to have leverage is a debatable topic.\n\u201cVictor, you were wrong.\u201d He turns his head to look back at me.\u201cYou were wrong when you said I fear nothing. You were so wrong....\u201d*Either I\u2019m having way too much fun playing this dangerous game with Victor, or something is seriously wrong with me.*No, this underground world he\u2019s opening me up to slowly isn\u2019t having the effect on me he had planned. It\u2019s only making me want more.\nI loved how strong and determined Sarai was. This is a girl who has been a prisoner, who could have easily given up on life. She knows much brutality but is brave nonetheless. She has lived her life at the hands of a drug dealer having to pretend to be something that she is not. She has had to survive. Sarai knows that she needs to escape but can she even lead a normal life is she actually manages to get out of the clutches of her prison. She is a woman with many layers \u2013 essentially put there out of necessity. As the story progresses and we begin to see the inner depths to the fascinating young woman, we see just how much she has endured and how she has been molded. With all this being said, Sarai may be damaged but she is far from broken. Perhaps because of all her inner complexities, Sarai is able to see past the merciless assassin that Victor obviously is and sees that, like her, he is also multi-layered, complex and complicated.\n\u201cIn the end, you can only trust yourself. I am not your hero. I am not the other half of your soul who could never let anything bad ever happen to you. Trust your instincts first always, and me, if you choose, last.\u201d\nVictor was such a mysterious and perplexing character. This man gives nothing away, exudes dominance and control and is dangerous. Obviously, one would have to be a cold, calculating and ruthless machine to do what he does; however, there was much more depth to his character. Here we have a man who has been trained from a young age to be a killer without a conscience. He must carry out acts that would leave most quaking. He has been made, a true product of his environment. When Sarai comes into the picture we see Victor being challenged by all the he knows. His layers are slowly unraveling and Sarai might just be his undoing.\nI don\u2019t think this thing between us is love, or even lust. It\u2019s something else, something powerful and unmistakable that neither of us have been able to ignore. But it doesn\u2019t have a face.\n\n\u201cBut you did something else that no one else ever could.\u201d His features soften and my heart is slowly melting. \u201cYou made me feel real emotions. You unlocked me.\u201d\nThe storyline, like the characters, is multifaceted and exhilarating. It will leave you wondering what will happen next and will keep you reading right until the end. Hang on and enjoy the fast-paced electrifying ride. There is nothing instant about relationship between Sarai and Victor. It slowly builds and progresses as the pair face many obstacles and challenges. Both characters make a vibrant and forceful pair \u2013 with Victor wanting to leave Sarai in a safe location on more than one occasion and with Sarai pushing to stay with Victor. Both are dealing with their own inner struggles. Both are slaves to how they were raised from a young age, yet they want to break free. Killing Sarai is definitely not a wonderfully sweet romance. Both the main characters are too damaged to do sweet and tender. What you do get is a man and a woman who determine that they are capable of \u201cfeeling\u201d and that they each strip away each other\u2019s fa\u00e7ade that has not been penetrated by another person. These two bond. They bond deeply. They untangle one another.All in all, Killing Sarai is a suspense filled novel that is beautifully executed. The ending does leave you wanting so much more but it is not a cliffhanger in the true sense of the word. There is a lot more to tell about Sarai and Victor and I, for one, will be anxiously awaiting what comes next. This book was original and brilliant. A definite must read!\n\u201cThis goes against everything that I am, Sarai,\u201d he says and then kisses me.\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d I whisper and kiss him back. \u201cIt\u2019s you becoming more of who you really are.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Hulya Kara Yuksel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32793174-hulya-kara-yuksel", "userReview": "OMFG finally we have official photos... \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0dhttps://www.instagram.com/killingsara...And you can read Jessica's official blog post. \u2764She is also giving some info about book 7!\ud83d\ude42http://inthecompanyofkillers.com/kill...----------VICTOR FAUST is getting ready to kill!!!

Its bold setting takes place in a twisted world where kidnapping, sex slavery, and cold-blooded murder barely induce so much as a flinch. Its intensity will astound you and its unique character development will have you unashamedly rooting for the bad-guy\u2014who, quite possibly, is not as bad as he seems...Sarai has been living in seclusion for years. Kidnapped at the tender age of fourteen and forced to witness rape, abuse, and murder, she has successfully grown numb to the effects of all things grotesque. Sarai, although also abused, remains her captor's favorite\u2014oddly obtaining a sort of twisted 'princess' status amongst the slaves. When she finally garners enough courage to run, it is straight into the frigid arms of a cold-blooded hit man...Victor lives for one thing: murder for money. He's cold, calculated and precise\u2014but he does display a conscience. He exudes a sexy confidence and has no room in his 'killing' schedule for a relationship, of any sort. Sarai is a distraction, as well as a threat. He'll use her presence only to gain the upper hand, and then she's a goner. He can't feel for her.He won't fall for her.But this may be the one thing over which the competent Victor has no control...\n\n\"What have you done to me?\" He says.\"I was going to ask you the same question.\"\n\nThe way these horrific events unfold is ingenious. The author uses such an eloquent demeanor in delivering these blows; it almost feels like a contradiction. This is not a pretty love story by any means, but its execution is beautiful. This story is told through dual perspectives. To be honest, I've become a bit wary of dual POV's; sometimes I enjoy deciphering a character's thoughts solely through their actions. I also find that some heroes lose their edge once the perspectives switch. But this author handled the transition seamlessly, and successfully added more vigor into an already intense story. Victor retained the same mystery and allure when revealed to us through his own perspective, and I appreciated the consistency. The final 30% of this book truly took my breath away. It took an unexpected turn, slightly twisting the tone into something darker, and it is precisely what made this a five-star read for me. The ending is not complete, although there is enough finality to keep you from pulling your hair out. That said, the open ending suggests a killer follow-up, and I honestly cannot wait!

That is the first thing that comes to mind when I think about this book. It really \u2018wowed\u2019 me. J.A. Redmerski just has a knack for writing my favorite books. This book is so different from the Edge of Never, but just as good. Darker reads, books with a little bit of a twist. Books where the hero is really the \u2018bad guy\u2019 too. Those are my absolute favorites. And this book fit right into that category. Sarai is a girl who has been a prisoner of a Mexican drug lord since she has been fourteen. For nine years. She wasn\u2019t kidnapped, she was handed off by her own mother. Now she is stuck there, with no means to escape. Until one night, she hears him. Victor. Victor is an American. He is hired by Javier (drug lord) to kill a man. Thats his job. Victor is a cold blooded killer. He doesn\u2019t kill \u2018innocents\u2019 but he has been killing for a long time. He doesn\u2019t have sympathy for anyone or remorse for what he does. Its what he was born to do, what he was trained to do. What he\u2019s been doing for as long as he can remember.When Sarai sees this American, she thinks... this is my one shot to get out of here. She takes it. She runs and sneaks into Victor\u2019s car. This is the start of Sarai and Victor\u2019s journey together. Victor isn\u2019t there to help Sarai, but he keeps her around for a bit because he knows she will be useful. She is a \u2018prize\u2019 for Javier, his favorite girl, and he knows he can bargain with her. Sarai isn\u2019t going back. One way or another, her time with Javier is over. If she ever faces him again one of two things will happen. She will kill him, or she will die trying. Either way, she\u2019s not living that life again. Even though Victor is a killer, she knows he is, she feels safe with him. Maybe not at first, but she grows to want him around, need him around. \n\u201cDespite my growing fear, I still want to be right where I am, trapped in the merciless arms of a killer.\u201d\nThis story was surprising, unpredictable. I found myself unable to put it down, just thinking... what is going to happen next??? Victor. Victor is \u2018the bad guy\u2019, but not really. Getting deeper into his character, we see why Victor has the cold exterior he has, why he is the way he is. He is something else.\nVictor has been doing his job a long time. He never screws up. Ever. If he did, it would mean death. He follows orders, follows the rules. No exceptions. But there is something about this girl, about Sarai that is different. He doesn\u2019t know why, but he needs to help her, to protect her. It\u2019s a dangerous game they are playing. \nSarai is a tough girl. All she went through, endured, yet she still puts others before her, she has a soft heart, but she isn\u2019t afraid to kick some ass. I was impressed with her character. Her story broke my heart. Spending her whole teenage/adult life captive, she was willing to do anything to escape her life. She is brave. Victor helps her, but this girl needs no saving. She saves herself. She fights her own battles. I loved watching Victor and Sarai\u2019s relationship develop. It was a slow build, but amazing to read. Sarai brings something out in Victor. Something he\u2019s never felt before. \u201cYou made me feel real emotions. You unlocked me.\u201d\nThis was such an incredible read. It had EVERYTHING. Drama. Action. Suspense. Sex. Emotion. It captivated me. It kept me on my toes, guessing what was going to happen next. I loved all the twists and turns. Just amazing! The ending... I wouldn\u2019t call it a cliffhanger. It wasn\u2019t a conventional HEA, but it sets up nicely for book 2... which I NEED asap!!! One of the best books I\u2019ve read in a while, a must read in my book!"}, {"userName": "xrysa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9016476-xrysa", "userReview": "SaraiBeautiful but defeated and damaged.VictorCan he be her savior?Sarai is a 23 year old girl.She's been held as a captive for 9 years.She cant stand witnessing the rapping and the abusing anymore.She has to escape.Yet her only opportunity for a ticket to freedom is an American.He is a cold blooded murderer but given the circumstances she cant be picky so she sneaks into his car threatening him and she is praying that her plan has worked.However back in the compound she left behind her best friend , Lydia , an angry slut,Izel, and a furious -let's say- boyfriend , Javier.He is brutal and dangerous but he never treated her like the rest of the girls. Sarai always had more civil in comparison to the other captives. Maybe it was because of her beauty or maybe because she wasn\u2019t really abducted.FYI Sarai is not the innocent girl you might give her credit for.She can be dangerous when her life is being threatened but she doesn\u2019t have the intention to hurt anyone.Victor has a strange and cold personality but he is her only protection.I liked him a lot not because of his blue-green eyes(yeah maybe that too) but because he is smart and very cautious. I would love to know why he is helping her in first place.In that way he is risking everything and he betrays everyone. Nevertheless he is genius and his plans always work.Well now that we all now how Sarai grew up,it has only left to wonder how she will fit into the society again.She is not normal and she will never be.She is a person that can manipulate the others and I have to tell that she is a perfect actress.This is a story of \nlife\n\nlove\n\ntrust\n\nand betrayal\nPart of me was so relived with the ending.I thought that everything was over but unfortunately nothing is over yet.I loved this book a lot.Their relationship is not your typical love story.It wasn\u2019t even clear if it was love or not.I have to admit that the author's writing style is absolutely amazing.Everything is so detailed and beautiful written.Nothing that you can predict will happen.

Yeah. I fell for the bad guy.From the first few pages,  Killing Sarai  had my undivided attention. Unputdownable! The story here is that of an American girl, Sarai, who was handed off to a Mexican drug dealer at the age of fourteen by her own mother. Her life since then has been one filled with drugs, brutality, murder and slavery. She knows escape is futile - it would be suicide. Out there in the middle of Mexico, there is literally no where she can go. So when an American hit man comes to the compound on business, she sees her way out and takes it.All she wants is to get home. But running away has it's consequences. Victor is a cold-blooded, hard man - trained from an early age to be a killer\u2026 and now, he's her only hope for survival.  \"I need you to help me... I've been a prisoner of Javier's since I was fourteen years old.\"\"And you assume I'm going to help because I am also American,\" he said simple.I hesitate before I answer, \"I-I... well why wouldn't you?\"\"It is not my business to interfere.\"\"Then what IS your business? I ask with a trace of distaste. \"To murder people in cold blood?\"\"Yes.\"\"You know I'm in a lot of danger,\" I say.\"Yes, but that still does not make you my problem.\"\"Are you HUMAN?\" I hate him more every time he speaks. \"What kind of man would not want to help a defenseless young woman especially when she has escaped her captors and is directly pleading for your help?\"He doesn't answer. \n I felt myself drawn to Victor's character. He was so intriguing! Always in control, always one step ahead. Smart, calculating, efficient, seemingly ruthless on the outside but I sensed a spark of something\u2026 deeper maybe?I couldn't tell what his end game was at first but that made sense because I don't think even he knew his end game. He was torn between what he was trained to do, what made sense to do given the world he lived in, but also what his conscience (however far buried it was) was telling him. And something about Sarai was slowly unraveling him.  \"In the end, you can only trust yourself. I am not your hero. I am not the other half of your soul who could never let anything bad ever happen to you. Trust your instincts first always, and me, if you choose, last.\" \n Sarai has really had the worst of life handed to her but yet she'd remained quite strong and I was pleasantly surprised to watch her discover her inner badass.The world was brutal but the descriptions were never too graphic. It told you just enough to keep you connected and 'in the moment' but never enough to make your stomach turn. Remember, this is a New Adult story so there is some steam, but it's not too detailed. I did wish there had been a little more though but I expect we might see more in the sequel.That being said, I loved seeing them slowly give into what they were feeling. It was more of a leap for Victor than Sarai because for him relationships were not only forbidden but simply did not belong in his dangerous lifestyle.  \"Despite my growing fear, I still want to be right where I am, trapped in the merciless arms of a killer.\" \n The plot was unpredictable and I loved that. It kept me wondering what would happen next and kept surprising me. That being said, it didn't really put my heart in my throat either, but it did keep my attention at all times.This is the kind of story that makes you just have to keep flipping the pages. The pacing is fast, the writing is fluid, the story is engaging and the characters are intriguing. All in all, it's a fabulous read if you're looking for something totally 'different'. I really enjoyed it!The ending\u2026 ho boy! It leaves you desperately wanting more but at the same time, I got the feeling that it would all be okay in the end. Basically, there is a slight cliffhanger. It wasn't a 'holy shit' kind of ending, but rather just one that clearly left a lot more to the story. And there is a note at the end that says that Victor and Sarai's story will continue in the sequel which is to be released later in 2013. I can't wait!4.5 stars CASTING: I think I found my Victor....Exclusive Excerpt here:\u2726 http://aestasbookblog.com/killing-sar...  Sarai was only fourteen when her mother uprooted her to live in Mexico with a notorious drug lord. Over time she forgot what it was like to live a normal life, but she never let go of her hope to escape the compound where she has been held for the past nine years.Victor is a cold-blooded assassin who, like Sarai, has known only death and violence since he was a young boy. When Victor arrives at the compound to collect details and payment for a hit, Sarai sees him as her only opportunity for escape. But things don\u2019t go as planned and instead of finding transport back to Tucson, she finds herself free from one dangerous man and caught in the clutches of another.While on the run, Victor strays from his primal nature as he succumbs to his conscience and resolves to help Sarai. As they grow closer, he finds himself willing to risk everything to keep her alive; even his relationship with his devoted brother and liaison, Niklas, who now like everyone else wants Sarai dead.As Victor and Sarai slowly build a trust, the differences between them seem to lessen, and an unlikely attraction intensifies. But Victor\u2019s brutal skills and experience may not be enough in the end to save her, as the power she unknowingly holds over him may ultimately be what gets her killed.This is their story\u2026  For more of my reviews, visit Aestas Book BlogAnd come join the Aestas Book Blog  Facebook Page"}, {"userName": "Pavlina Read more sleep less blog\u2764\u2764  ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6603203-pavlina-read-more-sleep-less-blog", "userReview": "Omg it was amazing!!!Killing Sarai kept me on my toes from the first page until the end!!I was captivated by the thrilling story!!!I love it!! :))This is a story about Sarai....who at the age of 14 her mother gave her away to a Mexican drug lord named Javier who has developed an obsessive liking towards her...She was been forced into a sexual relationship with Javier.Sarai finally caught a chance for freedom when Victor a hired assassin and a dangerous man visits the compound for some special mission that deals with Javier.She sneaks out of the compound and into Victor's vehicle not knowing that she may have escaped the clutches of one dangerous man but has now placed her fate in another man's lethal clutches..

The story was \"unable to put the book down for even a second\" good. It was unlike anything I've read in a long, long time. VictorVictor was an enigma. The author did such an amazing job with characterization that the reader got both not enough of Victor that he had this air of mystery about him the entire book, and yet give us just enough crumbs that made him incredibly endearing despite his coldness at the same time. He was scary, he was mysterious, he was also so DAMN HAWT! SyraiSyrai was such an incredible heroine. She was both vulnerable yet completely kick-ass. She went through hell for nine years. She has seen things that no child should ever have to see, and been through horrors. Never having a childhood, she went from one hell into a whole different one. When she escapes the captivity through a mysterious stranger she knows only as Victor. For a 23 year old, and having been through as much as she had, she still managed to come off as so incredibly strong.The story is not your fairy tale romance. It is not sunshine and rainbows and unicorns. It's dark, twisted, gritty, and sucks you in from the very first page.The romance builds realistically over time. I was so happy to see that the author did that, because had it been quicker or lust at first sight it would not have done these amazing characters justice. The majority of this book is the suspense and action, and it doesn't disappoint in either case. It's fast paced, and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very last page.The ending I felt was very fitting. It was not exactly a cliffhanger, though it is quite clear that their story is far from finished. As much as I would have loved a HEA, it would not have been true to the story to give Sarai and Victor one at that point of the book.__________________________________________________________My thoughts when I just finished the book:Holy shit!

I can't even begin to tell you how right this read was for me. Killing Sarai is one of those stories that just clicked with me from the first page. Angst, action, edge of the seat suspense and a subtly developed romance story. None of that insta-lust nonsense. First and foremost I have to thank my dear friend Jasmine for recommending me this series. J.A. Redmerski is a completely new author for me and I'm pretty confident to say I'm a fan after only reading one book.Let's talk story...Sarai has been living a life of captivity since she was fourteen years old. Nine years ago her mother took her to Mexico and ever since she was a drug lord's \"favourite\". With no way to escape she resigned herself to the life she was given, accepted her fate and played along. That is until one day an American arrives at the compound. The dormant fight rises in her and she uses her chance to flee.Victor Faust is an assassin. Cool, collected and very much in control of his world. Until the chatty girl hides in the back of his car after a meeting with a client. He starts to make decisions that threaten his life, his work and the armor around his person.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this thing between us is love, or even lust. It\u2019s something else, something powerful and unmistakable that neither of us have been able to ignore. But it doesn\u2019t have a face.\u201d\n\nThis is not a book about redemption or saving each other from a bad faith. In fact once Victor and Sarai meet their journey leads them even deeper down the rabbit hole. Both have lead lives commonly described as \u2018not normal\u2019. Victor joined \u2018the Order\u2019 when he was nine years old and was subsequently trained to become who he is now. Sarai grew up in a trailer park with a drug addict mother. After that, nine years of seeing violence, rape and crime desensitised her.For all intents and purposes both main characters are damaged in their own way. Together they create a loveable mix of dysfunction and ruthlessness. I was so fascinated by the way the author managed to fit them together like a puzzle. Step by step Sarai puts cracks in Victor\u2019s hardened exterior and Victor is just unable to pull the trigger on the girl and the connection they developed.They are by far the most captivating couple I have met in a long time. Even though the book is written in both their POVs we learn very little about Victor and he stays an enigma for the most part. Stoic and very silent. Well, and Sarai constantly managed to surprise me with her strength and astounding ability to cope.Of course they have to deal with a lot of trouble. Drug lords, employers, their own stubbornness, reckless behaviour and family members. Don't get me started on the somewhat open ending...luckily the next four books are already published. ;DKilling Sarai is the first book In the Company of Killers Series and is not a standalone read. Victor and Sarai's story continues with Reviving Izabel. I can only recommend picking up this book for the excellent writing and the spellbinding, action packed story alone. But if you also love a kick-ass heroine and a merciless assassin then I really don\u2019t know what you are waiting for.

Gun in hand, Sarai forces Victor the american visitor to take her to the american border. But Victor isn't the salvation Sarai was looking for, she realises that she may have left her captivity, but she has thrown herself in to a much more dire situation. the man she is with is a killer, and wouldn't think twice before ending her life.In one single moment it seems as if her life is about to end. But Victor surprises her, surprises even himself by doing exactly what he has been trained not to do. Sarai is an enigma to him, he feels drawn to her. He realises that she is a threat to him, but cannot decide how to remedy this problem even though it is quite obvious.Victor and Sarai journey is one filled with pain and uncertainty but also self discovery. Sarai begins to find the strength inside herself the longer she is with Victor. She may not be the ideal woman or the woman society expects her to be. But she becomes a woman of her circumstances, she becomes warrior no longer a victim. She learns to love, although she may not know it, this becomes her strength. Yes, at times she is scared but she no longer cowers in fright, but stands up and faces the challenge.Victor feels protective of Sarai, something he has never felt for any woman before. Her pain is something he takes no joy in, he wants her to be safe, have a chance at happiness, a good life.Victor's life scares Sarai, but not enough for her to not want to be around him. She sees a different side to him, he doesn't show it often, but it's there. Every glimpse she gets, proves to her that Victor has a heart although he might not want her to see it.This is a fast paced, gripping and thrilling novel. It will keep you on the edge of your seat, there are surprises at every turn of your digital page. I truly have never read a book like this before, Miss Redmerski you have been holding out on us! It will leave you craving more, leave you wanting to find another book that will match the absolute genuis that J.A Redmerski has created!I love books that are narrated in the first person, I think it feeds the need I have to become the character.

Sarai is rage. I am aware of my choices at all times. Sarai\u2019s choices are more aware of her, lying in wait to decide for her based on the severity of her mood with no intention in leaving her any conscious control over it.\u201d\nJ.A. Redmerski\u2019s Sarai is nothing like her hit novel The Edge of Never which I loved. This story is an entirely different animal. I read the book the first day it was released but sat on my review because I wasn\u2019t sure I could come up with enough adjectives to express to a reader how FANTASTIC this story actually is. This book is nonstop action there is no down time in the story to take a break. Please block out a fair amount of time to read this book because you will NOT want to stop at all! The writing, the characters, the alternating povs and the story were completely consuming. The main character Sarai rocks! She is one hell of a female lead. She is strong, damaged, smart and any reader will fall completely in love with her. \n\u201dShe shows all the signs of having lost the ability to react to fear and danger appropriately. She is numb to danger and that in itself is a death sentence.\u201d\nSarai\u2019s inner dialogue was perfection and made me feel like I was in fact on the run with Sarai from the horrible Javier in the car with the dangerous Victor. \n\u201dLike it or not, Victor is my only protection until I can get over that border and I\u2019m going to stick with him as long as I can regardless of my desperate need to get away from him, too.\u201d~Sarai\nSo it seems that Sarai\u2019s way out of her nine years of captivity from a drug lord in Mexico is an American who seems to be a cold blooded contract murderer. Victor NEVER does friendships or relationships.The way Victor\u2019s character unfolded was so well done. The way Victor teetered on the edge of staying true to his brother and his Order while protecting Sarai was so exciting.\n\u201dAnd I don\u2019t kill innocent people.\u201d Silence fills the small space between us.\u201cNo one is innocent,\u201d I snap, surprising myself. \u201cLeast of all me.\u201d\nSexual tension starts to rise while the couple faces one intense situation after another all the while Victor has to stay on track with his employer, his brother and his Order. A reader finds themselves falling hard for this couple to find a way to stay together even if it\u2019s not for the best.Once you hit the end of the story, you won\u2019t be left hanging on a cliff but actually excited for the continuation and hopes of what the next book will hold for these two characters.\n\u201dThis goes against everything I am, Sarai,\u201d he says and then kisses me.\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d I whisper and kiss him back. \u201cIt\u2019s you becoming more of who you really are.\u201d\nOverall the ending is not your typical hea.

What becomes of victims of abuse when they live through it daily for years? Are we a product of our environment, shaped and molded of the circumstances around us, adapted and programmed to survive no matter the cost? And what is the line that differentiates bad and good?Frankly, there is no black and white. Just a million shades of grey in-between...There is a whole world out there hidden beneath expensive clothes and glamorous parties. A world of depravity, abuse, slavery. And death. It's always death. Someone who deals in it, takes pleasure, inflicts, fights against it. It's up to the person to decide on which side of the gun will stand and who will walk away alive.Sarai has been a slave for the last 9 years. Her own mother sold her when she was fourteen, for her next fix, to a Mexican drug lord. She has a plan to escape and the American Assassin that her captor hired will be her way out.

A member of the Order, a secret organization of assassins he always has an agenda. Ruthless, methodical, cold, a weapon loaded to kill he will find his lost consciousness in the eyes of a girl hidden in the backseat of his car. But he isn't born a savior. He is not a white knight. His instincts are too raw for that and the kind of life that he has led, has him living on edge, kill or be killed, always ready for the next hit.Thrown together by circumstance and drawn to each other like moths to flame, these two damaged people with no hope for a future, are going to forge their own path, staying alive, healing the wounds that still bleed and just accept all the scars they collected along the way.

You will fall in love with a hired gun, sympathize with the devil and bawl your eyes out for a young girl who prefers to be a killer than return to a normal life that holds no meaning to her anymore.J.A. Redmerski weaves an exceptional story that you won't be able to put down, so much different than her previous work, simple in its inception but unbelievably complex as only a human soul and mind can be.

It was a suspense filled, drama packed, thrilling novel with an edge of hot romance. It had my stomach in knots and I was on the edge of my seat from the very beginning. Each sentence was so well put together, the words just rolled off the page like silk. I was completely absorbed in the story, the characters and found myself hanging onto each word like it was my lifeline. I deliberately took my time reading it because I didnt want it to end - it was brillant! This story is about a girl who tries to escape a life of abuse, murder and salvery. The only way she can escape is to trust a cold-blooded murderer whom she knows nothing about other than he is very dangerous. Will he help her? Will he risk his own life for her? Or Will he kill her?\nSarai\nSarai was not your typical herione. It was refreshing to see a female lead that was strong and brave. It's expected, that if a person has had to endure so much and suffer from horrific events, to be broken, scarred for life and discover they have become only a shell of a person. Sarai was not one of those people. She was determined, strong and reluctantly learnt how to adjust to dangerous situations by blocking out her fears and emotions. Overtime, she learnt how conceal her hurt and pride by putting up a convincing facade in life threatening situations for the sake of survival. Her character was both admirable and inspiring. However, everything comes at a price ...Can she change who she has become and live a normal life?OrIs she at the point of no return?\n\"I'm free of a life not of my choosing, because of Victor\".~ Sarai \n\nVictor\n\n\"We sit in stillness, both looking out ahead, both married to our thoughts. I wonder if hers are about me.\" ~ Victor \nVictor is a trained killer. When assigned a hit he fulfills it with no remorse. Life has taught him to trust no one and he won't think twice about ending a persons life. What about the innocent you ask? He believes no one  is truly innocent. He trusts no one. Not only he is an assassin but he is also rich, mysterious and attractive - a very dangerous combination.The relationship between Sarai is slow building which makes it all the more realistic. Alternating POV's between the two characters adds diversity and intrigue to the book.\n \"I want her to look upon me, just for a moment. But she never does and I walk away\". \nNow the question you all have on your mind....Is there a cliffhanger?Well - I will say this. I don't do cliffhangers .. at all. I have, as KC diagnosed it- a cliffhanger disorder. BUT I'm ok..For now anyway! It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Yes - there's still a lot of unanswered questions and it's not how I really wanted it to end but ....*takes a deep breath*.. I'm ok, and if  I'm  ok , you will be fine. It doesn't end with all hearts and flowers but there's potential. Trust me - you will be fine!

Nail-biting suspense & heart-pounding action that induced severe heart palpitations  Hot steamy scenesPut all of them together and.. WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER, JASMINE IS A HAPPY READER!!

She finally made her escape one night when Mr American, Victor showed up at the Mexican compound and Sarai saw that as her golden ticket out. But is Mr American actually a kind, loving man who's gonna save this poor innocent girl from the clutches of the drug lord? Trained to be a cold, detached assassin since the age of thirteen, Victor is the Number One in the Order and has never failed a mission. But with Sarai, he's breaking all the rules he's ever known and finds himself with a conscience to protect her. When the odds start to stack against them and loyalties are questioned, both Sarai and Victor battle to learn on who can be trusted ultimately.********* HOLY FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC THIS READ. This book was as awesome as watching a movie in my head! Of course, Fassbander is the PERFECT cast in my mind as Victor (eventhough he was initially referred as Mr American, Victor is of German heritage which makes Fassbender the perfect choice) and boy did my mind enjoy it A LOT! It pretty much amplified my experience and love for this read, so THANK YOU Michael Fassbender for graciously walking on our planet! \u2665\u2665As y'all know, I love me a BAMF heroine who's ready to take shit and give it back twice as much. Sarai was a fighter, that's for sure. I loved her resilience but I also loved that she was broken. A strong heroine doesn't mean that she has less fears, but to me, a strong one is one that is willing to acknowledge her fears and face them. \n\"The things I've admitted are things that have haunted me for the longest time. They've been buried in my soul, burning through to the very core of me, rendering me emotionless and turning me into someone entirely different than I was supposed to be.\"\nAlso when the romance falls in the backburner for me in a suspense/thriller read, I definitely know that the book will work for me. Yes I'm a romance junkie, but I'm a dark/suspense/thriller junkie first ;) And with this one, the suspense gripped me and brought me on a fast-paced thrilling ride because it was completely un-putdownable. \n\"The first kill is always the hardest, the one you never forget. But the first kill is also what drops the chances of living a normal life by half.\"\n*********I was in the minority who didn't fully enjoyed Redmerski's other work, The Edge of Never, but with Killing Sarai, THIS is a whole different ballgame and it was a BEAST! JA Redmerski still brought out her exceptional writing with this one and added on with a tinge of romance plus loads of suspense & thrill with badass characters, this book is making its way to the top of my dark thriller reads shelf!

HOLY.FUCKIN.SHIT !!!!! The ending ... Off the charts amazing ! \nKilling Sarai is the story of Sarai , who has been living as a slave to a Mexican mafia/druglord named Javier for the past 9 years of her life . Javier has a twisted description of the entire scenario though . See , he believes that he is in love with Sarai , a love that is downright obsession . And that's why keeps her locked up in his compound . He basically deals with drugs , weapons and women , so Sarai isn't the only girl in his business and his house . But Sarai wants an escape .. a way out from this hellish life . That escape comes in the form of an American assassin , Victor . Sarai takes her chance and finds a way out of her life in captivity . But her freedom plans are busted when she realizes that she just walked out of hell's circus and ran straight into a lion's den . Victor is a million times dangerous than Javier .. and he has his own plans for Sarai .. What are those plans ? Who is Victor ? What led Sarai to Javier ? And will she ever find a way out of her ordeals ?? To answer those questions you'll just have to be a part of Killing Sarai ! You know what the best part about reading this book was ??? It was its unpredictability ! You read that blurb and think , ' hmmm , I might have a clue what's gonna happen here ' and start making your assumptions . But holy damnation !!! You will be in a state of surprise and shock and awe as well with J.A's story weaving skills . I was glued to the pages , and every time I told myself I'll just read one page , I failed miserably in doing so ! The unpredictable twists and turns make it nearly impossible to stop reading and take a breather ! Hell , I stayed up late at night to try and finish but forced myself to stop reading because lets face it , no woman is a fan of watching herself in the mirror and finding huge dark circles and baggy eyes due to lack of sleep . Hell no !Another thing that I've noticed about J.A writing ( I've read only two books by her so far including Killing Sarai ) is that even though she has some really hot , like fan-yo-self-hot moments in her story , she doesn't let the sex/steam moments rule the story line/plot ... That being said , she can write some really hot scenes ! Especially when a guy like Victor is involved !!!! \nSpeaking of the man himself , Victor has to be one of the hottest book boyfriends with the coldest demeanor ever ! He may be hot as hell , but his heart resembles a rock that has been frozen for ages ! No remorse , no regrets ... He is silently lethal ! Victor has his own reasons for being what or who he is .. But that changes when he meets Sarai . Sarai on the other hand is one of those leading ladies that can kick some major ass ! Nine years in captivity , witnessing numerous acts of abuse , her defense mechanism technique to cope with all the cruelty around her has enabled her to bottle up all her emotions ! Just the tiniest bit of a shake and she is ready to erupt ! Getting to know Sarai was like unraveling a gift ! Holy hell the things that girl is capable of doing just makes my jaw hit the floor ! Soo did not see those coming ! On the whole , Killing Sarai is an addictive fast paced thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seats and your eyes glued to your kindle ! Cannot wait to read Reviving Izabel ... Things are about to get a whole lot more interesting !!! \n But you did something else that no one else ever could.\u201d His features soften and my heart is slowly melting. \u201cYou made me feel real emotions.

It was dark, but thankfully not on the level I was worried over. Sarai was a heroine that took an opportunity and ran, and I was rooting for her the whole way!Sarai was taken from the US by her mother at age fourteen to go live with a drug lord, Javier, in Mexico. Unfortunately for Sarai, Javier always had his eye out for her: \n\u201cI call it a sickening obsession, he calls it love.\u201d -Sarai\nFor the last nine years she\u2019s been his captive, but when an American assassin, Victor, shows up, Sarai sees this as her ticket out of the compound and stows away, thinking he will help her escape back to the US. What she doesn\u2019t realize is that Victor has a cold heart, and helping her is not at the top of his list. Victor is calculating and dangerous!! What Victor doesn\u2019t realize is how much this girl will get under his skin, because it\u2019s a slow undoing for him. Let\u2019s just say, resistance is futile. He sees a fearless, kindred spirit in her. Sarai has been molded by her dark past, just as Victor has by his. This is the best kind of romance, built slowly, but surely! It was a thrill to read the slow progression and growing attraction. \nWe are one in the same and I don\u2019t want to imagine being on my own without him. Ever.\nOh, I was on the edge of my seat for most of this story! If I could\u2019ve, I would\u2019ve read this straight through in one sitting. I was so invested in Sarai and her story of escape and survival! Javier is not about to let her go so easily and I was biting my nails wondering what would happen next! I was impressed with Sarai and her ability to stay strong and unbroken in the face of so much. Victor is an intense, complicated, and determined man, so I couldn't wait to discover the chinks in his armor. We discover that Sarai isn\u2019t his only undoing, but recent events have caused him to question his path in life, as well. J.A. Redmerski managed to write a thrilling mix of suspense, danger with a forbidden romance thrown in. In other words, everything I love in a story! This doesn\u2019t leave off on a cliffhanger, but I\u2019m still desperate for book two!You can read this review and more at The Readers Den."}, {"userName": "Sharon \u221e\u2765 is an emotional book junkie \u2765\u221e ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3275325-sharon-is-an-emotional-book-junkie", "userReview": "This is a story about two people that were denied a normal childhood and had to change themselves in order to survive. Sarai was given to Javier, a Mexican drug lord,  by her drug addict mother (!!), at the age of fourteen and held hostage for nine years. Victor was recruited by The Order at the age of nine and trained to be an assassin, that's right...an assassin. This is their story. Okay, so let me just start with a couple of things...the first being this book really has a strong Dark Duet vibe for me. Not the same intensity but definitely the same feel. Second, when the book was first put up with no blurb, the title alone was a little scary. And there's good reason...it IS about killing, lots of killing and lots of blood. Yes, there's some romance but it's definitely not your usual romance. Lastly, there's not really a cliffhanger...not in the sense of OMG, WHAT IN THE EFF IS HAPPENING!! No, not like that but maybe...omg, what in the heck is happening! It does end unfinished and that's why there's book two! (Can't wait for Reviving Izabel!!)So Caleb, err I mean Victor ;)...is cool, calm and collective. He's a man of many faces. The story is told in alternating POVs so thank goodness we get his thoughts. I'm not sure I would've liked it as much if we hadn't. And...it takes a while to get to know him and what he is thinking but it makes the journey very intriguing.Victor (but with shorter hair!)Sarai was amazing...definitely a survivor but she has somehow managed to keep her kind heart...and I like to think that's what Victor sees. She's been traumatized but somehow she focuses that into what she needs to do and it's made her stronger. And her feelings for Victor are a little befuddled. Yes, he helped her and yes, she has no one else but is that why she is developing feelings for him? The 'romance' was killing me. Like I said, this is not a typical romance but you know there's so much potential. The frustrating part is we only find out things s-l-o-w-l-y and we're never really sure what is real as far as what Victor and Sarai are feeling. Well, maybe Sarai....and I want to think Victor too but you have to read it and see. So, of course, there's lots of drama...betrayals and blindsides. It definitely keeps things interesting. There's also some crazy characters...namely Niklas, Victor's brother. I'm not a fan of his but I do agree with what Sarai did towards the end. The \"ending\"...made me a little sad. I was hoping for a little more breakthrough but there is...possibility and that's always promising. I was happy with how Victor set things up for Sarai and I loved the surprise person! ~sigh~ I would definitely recommend reading this if you want something a little dark, a little different and something you cannot put down. \u2665 Thank you, Chiqui, for pushing me to read it and letting me have one of \"your men\" for a short time! \u2665 \u2666 Bonus!! \u2666  We get an excerpt for The Edge of Always at the end and while it's really good, I can't believe she left it like that....ugh!! \u2665 Victor and Sarai's song \u2665Favorite quotes: (Beware they may have minor spoilers)\u2666 \u201cI knew you had it in you, Sarai.\u201d (that haunts me!)\u2665 \u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep alone,\u201d she says gently.

I'm still rooting for Victor & Izabel peeps ;) -------------------------------------------First read: January 2016This is one of the cases when you are trying to come up with words but couldn't think of any. I had a hard time organizing my thoughts. I am absolutely stunned and speechless.  J.A. Redmerski indeed surprised me. I am beyond impressed she pulled off something darker and more twisted story than The Edge of Never and The Edge of Always, which are my favorites.\n\n\"She's already so anesthetized to what is normal that she might never live a normal life.\"\n\nThe story is about a twenty three year old girl named Sarai. Her mother let a Mexican drug lord to have her at fourteen years old. For years, she didn't have a normal life and somewhat got used to witness death and violence. When she overheard a conversation between Javier and the American, that became an opportunity to escape. What she didn't know that Victor - the American- is a dangerous, merciless assassin on mission. She took the risk of getting in his car, maybe he can help her and is on the run..\n\n\"I am discipline. Sarai is rage.\"\n\nVictor didn't really offer to help Sarai but he lets her to go with him and thinks of a strategy on how she will be useful during his job. Everything is unplanned and he needs to come up with a new strategy to get it done. Being an assassin, he does not allow himself to be emotionally attached to someone. However, there is something about the girl that makes him want to protect her from danger. He wants her to give a shot of a normal life she truly deserved. Doing so, he is risking his life for it.I will not tell you much about it because there are so many things happened. I am fully engrossed with the story. It is thrilling, intense, action-packed,and mind-blowing. It's better that you get into it without knowing too much and let the surprises take over. Every chapter is heart pounding and will definitely put you on the edge of your seat.  The sequence of events are well written. The plot twists are so good, I swear. REALLY GOOD. \n\n\"You made me feel real emotions. You unlocked me.\"\n\nSarai and Victor are fascinating and strong-willed characters. I am so amused and hooked with these two. Sarai isn't bothered of Victor being an assassin. She tried engaging him with conversations and is very patient with it. He's the only one whom she can trust with. What they have been through made them closer. The characters are well developed and had a wonderful intensified romantic build up Without any doubt, this series deserves a rave. I think I made a good decision to finally read it because I'm going to read the sequel ASAP. This cliffhanger makes me want to read more and I crave for it. I just splurge everything here. Thank you Sylvia (click to read her review) for recommending this book to me. There is an \"In the Company of Killers\" Read-a-long hosted by Riley and Lainey (which I'm participating. Thank you for hosting! Now, I'm gonna read Reviving Izabel."}, {"userName": "Ramona", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33526516-ramona", "userReview": "I have this book on my TBR list like forever and I never got to it, until I found out it was turning into a TV series. That peeked my interest and wanted to see if the book was really worth the attention it received. \u201cKilling Sarai\u201d is not my style, but I loved it and soon became addicted to the story and the characters. They are so imperfect, so damaged, that you fall in love with them and their flaws.Sarai lived all her teenage life between gangsters and drug dealers. She was brought there by her mom and after she died, became the favorite of Javier, a notorious drug dealer that apparently fell in love with her. He also ran a very complex underground women traffic operation, and Sarai witnessed it all. During the years, she felt accustomed to this way of living, until her attention was caught by Victor, a mysterious man, that seemed to be American, just like her. Convinced that due to this he will help, she used him to escape, only to get caught in another web of danger, killing and life threatening events.Killing Sarai is destined to be a TV series, because it is actioned packed, and gives you a true addiction to the plot.Sarai is not your average heroine, because she is damaged, even if she wants to stay strong and pretend otherwise. Hostage without her will, used for her body, she coped with her situation and managed to believe that she will be ok. Even if Javier was treating her differently than the others, taking her to parties and giving her luxuries vs the other girls, Sarai is practically a sex slave. She has seen death, girls being beaten, raped, drugged and so on. When Victor appears, her instincts were to trust him and use him to escape. She did it, but the real journey began then, because everything changed for Sarai. When I looked at the title, I thought that \u201eKilling Sarai\u201d was about a murderer that wanted to kill the heroine, but now I know it runs deeper than that. When Sarai leaves with Victor, she stops being SARAI and becomes someone else, someone who has to cope with a new way of life, a new meaning, that apparently fist her well. She will enter Victors world and discover how much she belongs in it.I liked Victor as well, even if for a hero he is very cold and calculated, becoming an assassin from the early age of 9. He kills without asking questions and he was meant to kill Sarai as well, but he didn\u2019t. Throughout the book we discover that this character has a lot of layers and ladies, you will swoon! I personally loved their connection, their moments, even if there were not a lot of steamy ones, but the build up is palpable and you feel the anticipation growing stronger. They really became a power couple and I look forward to reading the sequel, because I know things will progress even faster than in the first book.I totally recommend this book because it is really special, in a raw sort of way. It shows you the ugly part of life, where crimes and danger go hand in hand, and only the strong can survive. It tells a story about 2 people that meet under extreme circumstances and when something changes in them, they become an unstoppable force of nature.5 stars!"}], "description": "From the author of the New York Times, USA Today & Wall Street Journal bestselling novel, THE EDGE OF NEVER, comes a story of passion and survival\u2026\nSarai was only fourteen when her mother uprooted her to live in Mexico with a notorious drug lord. Over time she forgot what it was like to live a normal life, but she never let go of her hope to escape the compound where she has been held for the past nine years.Victor is a cold-blooded assassin who, like Sarai, has known only death and violence since he was a young boy. When Victor arrives at the compound to collect details and payment for a hit, Sarai sees him as her only opportunity for escape. But things don\u2019t go as planned and instead of finding transport back to Tucson, she finds herself free from one dangerous man and caught in the clutches of another.While on the run, Victor strays from his primal nature as he succumbs to his conscience and resolves to help Sarai. As they grow closer, he finds himself willing to risk everything to keep her alive; even his relationship with his devoted brother and liaison, Niklas, who now like everyone else wants Sarai dead.As Victor and Sarai slowly build a trust, the differences between them seem to lessen, and an unlikely attraction intensifies. But Victor\u2019s brutal skills and experience may not be enough in the end to save her, as the power she unknowingly holds over him may ultimately be what gets her killed.This is their story\u2026", "title": "Killing Sarai\n      \n          (In the Company of Killers #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18400085-killing-sarai", "average": 4.16, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1377935863l/18400085.jpg", "reviews": 2567, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5437976.J_A_Redmerski", "name": "J.A.
