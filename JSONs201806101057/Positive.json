I am so glad I didn't make you suffer through this with me. I took one for the team!Oh my bleeding eyeballs, but I am very disheartened to report that very little in this book's almost 500 pages did anything for me. Despite the zombies, despite the post-apocalyptic landscape, despite the grappling, unending confrontations with human depravity and the silver threads of uncovering and recovering pieces of our humanity --- ALLLLL of my favorite things -- David Wellington's Positive still managed to bore the pants off me. Over and over again. The prose is just too plodding, too clumsy, too eager to tell -- tell everything about everything! -- rather than ever get out of the damn way and show. The unending, unforgivable descriptions of what characters think and feel are wearying and unsatisfying. Show me dammit!! Let actions speak louder than words. Then perhaps a plodding 500 page novel can be edited into a leaner, meaner 350 pages. Sigh. Characters are very cardboard cutout and as the hero -- Finn is just too goody-goody unbelievable to the point of being grating. As the first-person narrator his voice fails miserably doing no justice to himself, supporting characters or the novel's action. His unflagging \"do the right thing never give up\" attitude is sanctimonious and unrealistic as Wellington fails to balance it with anything deeper or nuanced. And then he just becomes so insufferable in his \"my people\" way of speaking and thinking. YOU'RE NOT MOSES, FINN, AND THIS AIN'T THE EFFING DESERT. I kept longing for the uber-dysfunctional assholery of Rick Grimes to give the story some texture and believability. Anyway, this was supposed to be my great summer zombie read. No. Not. Negative.

Thought I'd add my review here to share my love. This is one of those books that you don't want it to end. Not a zombie fan? Me neither. I enjoy Walking Dead, (not to the same degree as my teenage son), but then it isn\u2019t about the zombies, is it? It\u2019s about people surviving in a post-apocalyptic world, the politics and the break-down of society. The zombie killings are for the fun of it, yes? So I wasn\u2019t thinking, yay, David Wellington's Positive is the book for me. It has Zombies in the blurb. However, it was the book for me. Wellington has cleverly put a new spin on an overstuffed genre. There\u2019s heart in Positive, solid characters, and a storyline that doesn\u2019t dawdle along examining all the minutiae which bogs down some of these post-apocalyptic stories. It\u2019s the book Walking Dead viewers should read when they still want zombies, but need a fresh take. The only thing I didn\u2019t love about the book was that it ended. I didn\u2019t want to leave the characters or the Positive world behind. Positive drops us into Manhattan, where society has a certain normality about it now the zombie apocalypse is into its second generation of survivors This younger generation know nothing else except this world of struggling survival. When their parents tell them it was better in our day, it absolutely is the truth. Within Manhattan, they are fairly safe, although this zombie virus can sometimes gestate for up to twenty-one years. If you are unfortunate enough to be born to someone who suddenly turns zombie, like our protagonist Finn, whose mother goes Zombie, you are tattooed with a positive sign and segregated from the population until the expiration of the incubation period. Finn, meant to be delivered to a camp in another state to wait out his time, has his transport ambushed. He is left alone to survive in the treacherous territory outside the safety of Manhattan. In order to stay alive, he must throw his lot in with scavengers and various people who have adapted to the constant threat of death. It\u2019s a road trip of epic adventure and drama, as Finn realizes zombies may not be the worst enemies he must face. Wellington is an accomplished writer with a great story to tell in the ilk of The Passage, The Road, and even Stephen King\u2019s The Stand. For all those zombie and horror snobs, jump in to this novel and get your reading hands bloodied, so to speak. You may be surprised how enjoyable the genre is when you\u2019re in the hands of a talented writer. I still may not be a zombie fan, but I\u2019m now firmly a David Wellington fan.If you are a post apocalyptic fan, this is for you even if you're not a zombie fan.I received a copy of this book from Harper Collins for an honest review.

In a way, this book kind of reminded me of Julie Kagawa's Blood of Eden series but instead of vampires, we have zombies and people who have tested positive for the zombie virus. Positive is a new spin on the zombie apocalypse story. In Positive, the zombie apocalypse occurred about 20 years earlier. People live in the relative safety of walled cities. Our hero hails from Manhattan, where the subways are flooded and provide some fishing for our hero Finn and his buddy Ike. The zombie virus is also a different take on the old zombie story. Now it can take anywhere from exposure to 20 years for the zombie virus to manifest and turn a person into a snarling flesh-eating killer. When Finn's mother goes zombie, the whole family is tested and Finn is sent to a medical camp in Ohio. He doesn't get there right away because his ride is killed by a very scary lady. Finn begins his voyage across the US looking for that medical center where all will be good. On his way he learns about the world outside Manhattan. This is a journey story and each step along the way builds Finn's character. From what he sees of the world, he knows what kind of man he doesn't want to become. I liked Finn's character. For someone with so little life experience, he was a quick learner and even quicker to react to situations. I loved how he treated his \"family\" and wanted to keep the girls safe, especially Kylie. Kylie was a strong character as well considering what she had gone through with Adare. Positive kept me reading way into the night. The last part of the book was intense and I couldn't put the book down. I look forward to reading more books by this author in the future.Thank you to Edelweiss and Harper Voyager for a review copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613919-jason", "userReview": "4 Stars Positive by David Wellington was a pleasant surprise. I have truly been tired of the whole flesh eating, walking dead zombie scene. I cannot stomach another teen angst post apocalyptic puke fest. I am as turned off to the genre-gone-pop culture now, as much as I was once turned off to vampires a la Twilight. I am just bored of reading the same thing over and over again.Wellington does this one right in that he gives us a protagonist worth routing for and a person worth caring about. Finnegan(Stones) is a young man that has his whole life turned upside down when he tests for and is subsequently marked as a Positive. A person that could one day simply zombie out. I really liked the growth that he under goes and the way we see him become a man worthy of his name. Kylie, the small female lead is also easy to identify with and she shows great growth as well.Positive works because it is a well written story. A lot happens in this book and we are given quite a lot of backstory and world building giving this book some meat and potatoes. There are several good side characters that add to the color. I thoroughly enjoyed this book from cover to cover and was satisfied with my read. To me this is a big fat deal because I get have had my fill of the genre lately. It is easy to recommend this book.Now a seriously long digression. I have a serious problem with the genre. With our society. With my neighbors. And with my family and friends. Modern man...25,000 years of written record. Evolution. Expansion. Education. Humans are supposed to be an enlightened species. We are supposed to have morals, compassion, and empathy. We are supposed to be evolving and becoming more. Yet like in this book, all books, movies, television, and even the nightly news, when the shit hits the fan we immediately become something worse than the actual monsters portrayed. We kill each other. We rape our women. Fuck we rape our children. Never in these incidents are we anything less than sickening animals. I have a serious problem with this and wonder if it will ever be different. I have a serious problem believing in a real society when underneath all, we sucks. Oh well.

Wellington does a tremendous job adding subtle twists to the genre while delivering increasing tension as the adventure unfolds. Not many zombie stories are about the post-post apocalypse, and I was fascinated at how this second generation of survivors survived. The concept of how the virus incubates was very clever and presented a new kind of unsuspecting horror.I loved our main character, Finn, and the main female lead, Kylie. Very subtle character growth on both of their parts, but each scene showed change, and in the end I was moved because of the realistic and courageous way they learned to embrace life.The short chapters were great for how easy they were to read before bed, often forcing me to read just one more, and one more. Each one, while short packed, is filled with purpose in a way that only gifted, experienced storytellers can.I love that this book was long enough to give us an epic adventure from a walled off New York to the open wasteland of the Midwest. This is the kind of survival adventure I love. His description of zombie encounters was terrifying. I only wish there were more. The focus left zombies almost entirely midway through \u2014 maybe that was for the best, but I missed their role.I think people who are tired of mediocre zombie fiction will love the freshness of this tale and seek out more David Wellington stories, ASAP.I was sent a review copy as part of the HarperVoyager Super Readers program in return for an honest review.

The surrounding cities are left to rot. The zombies, control them, living in the crumbling ruins. Manhattan is semi safe, not having seen a zombie in over 15 years. The island is a sort of safe zone, but still few dare to go down to street level, old fears die hard. When a young second generation boy catches a strange cockroach type thing and brings it home for dinner his whole word changes.Positives, people exposed to the virus are sent outside the safe zone to go to a camp set up by the Government. A place where they are treated and hopefully survive the incubation period. This poor teen boy was thrown out, and his escort to the camp was dead, murdered. He takes off towards the camp where he thinks his life will be put back together. To bad his path leads him to horrors he couldn\u2019t even contemplate. Life in the wilds, is not pretty it\u2019s filled with survivors and most have not made it because of their kindness, it was their ruthlessness.

It's neither great literature nor a genre blockbuster, but David Wellington's latest is an entertaining tale of survival against all odds with just enough flourishes of creativity to (almost) balance out the moments of deus ex machina.This is a story told in arcs, the first of which is actually the most interesting, as it establishes the world one generation removed from the zombie outbreak. He doesn't attempt to explain it, just acknowledges that it happened, as the focus is on survival in the new world created by the collapse. This is a world where America is in ruins, the water is toxic, and highways are abandoned, and the zombies are still wandering the wilderness. There are some exquisite set pieces here, including the flooded subway tunnels of Manhattan and the bombed out town of Trenton, and they provide much of the appeal.The characters, unfortunately, are rather thin and undeveloped. Finnegan is forced to grow, but he does so in leaps and bounds, trading his youthful naivete overnight for a jaded sort of street sense. Those around him are really just playing roles, and we never get deep inside their thoughts or their emotions. The villains are, not surprisingly, the most interesting of the bunch, but even they're largely one-dimensional. Adare is a pragmatic survivalist who doesn't mind looting to stay alive, and he's actually be almost respectable if it wasn't for his predilection for underaged girls. Red Kate I thought had some real potential, and I kept waiting for some deeper layers to be revealed, but she never rises above her bad-ass road pirate role. Anubis and his skeleton cult sounded promising, but he's left completely off the page, and all we get to see are the stalkers to preach the doctrine of sacrifice.All that aside, it really is an interesting tale of survival, with the second story arc introducing us to the looters, outlaw towns, and corruption within the army. The third arc gets rather dark, as we discover that some things really are to good to be true, and that sometimes one man's sanctuary is another's prison. The final act, though, is the strongest of the them all, as we bear witness to an act of rebuilding, an attempt that everybody thinks is ludicrous, but which earns the respect of even the army. Of course, this is also the act where everything comes to a head, and all the enemy forces converge on Finn and his people, but it's well-plotted with some real moments of sorrow and drama.If you're as tired of zombie novels as I am, then rest assured that Positive is a novel about the survivors, not the zombies. It's a post-apocalyptic sort of morality tale, one in which the evil are punished, the good suffer, and hope shines through. It has its flaws, no doubt about it, but it's a legitimate page-turner right through to the end.Originally reviewed at Beauty in Ruins"}, {"userName": "paula", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1543634-paula", "userReview": "I am noticing in myself a sinking feeling - an automatic 'here we go again' feeling that until now I haven't really been able to put my finger on.I noticed it when I read a recent John Varley novel, and then I felt it again when I was about halfway through The Rule of Three by Eric Walters and hadn't encountered a single female character who wasn't useless. I looked up the author. \"Oh I see,\" I thought. Guy author, not young, experienced science fiction writer. (Varley I already knew. Varley is exceptionally old. His women are either Barbarella or Mamie Eisenhower, and I probably knew that going in.)So when I opened \"Positive,\" and saw a fairly extensive \"also by\" list, indicating a not-young author (who was male), it occurred to me that I might be in for more of the same. Nobody likes to admit making assumptions based on two or three data points, but when you read as much as I do you can't help perceiving patterns. And this is a pattern: male sci-fi authors over the age of 40 writing bullshit female characters.OF COURSE it isn't universal. OF COURSE some of the greatest women of all time have been written by men over 40. But when the slave girl turns on her master and flat-out murders his ass, saving the main character's life (or at least his balls), and then turns to him and says, \"What do we do now, hero? You're our new leader,\" well, that author is not doing much for the reputation of middle-aged male sci-fi writers.Otherwise, this is not bad post-zombie-apocalypse fiction. The plot has an episodic Old-West kind of structure, a little bit Firefly, a little A Boy and His Dog. Main character's name is Finn, hence slavery, journey, etc. (Although if we're doing that, this makes the slave girl Jim, and as divisive as Twain's characterization of Jim has proven over the years, replacing a black slave with a girl slave does not seem like a good choice...either.) The zombies are silent and slow and relentless. There's an underlying sense that the main character doesn't really know the score, giving the book a little vibration of sympathetic dread. But damned if every female character is not evil, willfully helpless, or neutered by age. Frustrating."}, {"userName": "All Things Urban Fantasy", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2732683-all-things-urban-fantasy", "userReview": "Review courtesy of All Things Urban Fantasy:POSITIVE's post apocalyptic America is a scary place: walled cities that are barely surviving, a terrifying death cult moving in from the west, and endless stretches of open road with zombies at every turn. It's a wild, wild ride.Finnegan is exiled from New York at 18, but he still feels very much like a child. He is a second-generation survivor, and he doesn't understand why the first-generation are so quick to panic. When he is thrust from the relative safety of Manhattan island into the wilds, he has a steep learning curve to deal with. I loved how little things showed how sheltered he was: thinking Ohio is two hours away from Manhattan, not understanding family pictures, and more. As he meets people, more nasty than good, he quickly learns how difficult it is to survive after the world has ended.By the end of the book though, he has matured and turned into a leader of his fellow Positives, people who have been exposed to the zombie virus and could change at any time. His evolution feels natural and realistic, with Finn doubting himself along the way and struggling to keep this eclectic group of people together. I think what suprised me most about the book is that no matter how devastatingly horrible things got, by the time I put it down I felt really good about it. In the end, it's a pretty positive book.Wellington's writing style is quick and chilling, with short little chapters that keep the story moving. It makes it easy to keep up with the pace. Even when there is a slower portion of the story, Finn's safety is never guaranteed. Whether he is being held by a slave driver or in the hands of the benevolent government, it's a dangerous world to live in and the pressure never lets off.Filled with truly horrific, evil characters (other humans, honestly), POSITIVE is not for the faint of heart but is a wonderfully original take on the post-zombie world. So many books concentrate on the apocalypse; it's refreshing to see what happens when it's time to try to rebuild. Highly recommended for both zombie and post-apocalyptic lovers."}, {"userName": "\u22dfKimari\u22de", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3555205-kimari", "userReview": "[only remain dormant for up to twenty years.

You've got The Hero (alternate title of this book should be 'Finnegan Explains It All'), The Princess (a sex slave, of course, with typical rape victim emotional issues), The Castle (aka, let's steal Alexandria from The Walking Dead, wall and all, and just run with it), and in between there's a whole host of lawless baddies (including both soldiers and pirates) who only exist to pound it into your head that The Zombies Are Not the Real Monsters (hint: we are). Finn, the obnoxiously smarmy, wise-beyond-his-years-in-such-a-special-way protagonist, has all of the answers and all of the right moves, even when he doesn't or shouldn't because he is a fucking 19-year old kid who's never been out in the world alone. What he should be is dead, given the carnage he's thrust into, but oh no - instead everyone he meets looks up to him with unquestioning, wide-eyed adulation. Pedophile looters see him as the son they never had. Underage sex slaves want him to be their protector. Even his arch enemy respects him so much that they go to absurd lengths just to tangle with him over and over. Physical pain does not stop him; emotional trauma is simply chicken soup for his shiny, indomitable soul. All of his ideas are amazing, save for the token Bad Decisions that lead him into necessary Close Calls and Brushes with Danger.

If you are living day by day just trying to survive and it is a dog eat world than you may have to kill just to survive as only the strongest and smartest survive. In this book it really is the humans that are the strongest presence and not the zombies. So if you are a zombie fan than you may be disappointed with the lack of zombies.

He's into the zombie apocalypse, so I thought I would give it a go. Anyway, it's not great. I think we only made it to like, chapter 20-ish. We both found it to be unconvincing, and the main character is kind of awful.At the beginning, it's set in a Manhattan stronghold, 15-20 years after the virus outbreak. The population is made up of first generations (adults who survived the apocalypse), and second generations (their kids, who are mostly teens). I found it extremely frustrating, and unconvincing, that apparently all the first generations are too terrified to leave their homes despite there being no zombies in the city for over 15 years, and the second generations all just seem to have no respect for the experience and knowledge of the first generations. Maybe it's just because the second generations have grown up without fear and have been lulled into a false sense of security by the radio and what they've been told by the government, but you would think that they would take the first generation more seriously. And sure, not every first generation needs to be a hardened warrior, but there seemed to be no first generation hero - they all seemed to be afraid of the dark, and the second generations just make fun of them.Maybe it was a metaphor for PTSD in veterans and maybe a lesson for us millennials to take our elders more seriously, but it just wasn't done well. Then there's our main character, Finn. He is banished from the stronghold, as his mother suddenly turned into a zombie, meaning that its possible that he too has the virus in his system. The virus is transferred via bodily fluids, such as blood, or breastmilk, which is what Finn gets snapped on. Finn gets tattooed with a large plus sign on the back of his hand, to indicate that he has the virus in his system. Hmmm, does this sound a lot like HIV? Is there a lesson here in how it must feel to be branded as HIV positive? Well, you know what, the book is written badly enough for me to not care.Once Finn is exiled, he is expecting to be picked up on the outer borders of the city by a government official to take him to a medical quarantine camp to wait out the virus incubation period. Unsurprisingly, this doesn't happen. Unsurprisingly, there are looters who attack him. Unsurprisingly, he gets chased by zombies. Unsurprisingly, he is eventually picked up by a gang of looters and joins their crew. Before he's picked up, Finn spends like 24 hours in 'the wilderness' = stereotypical barren desert wasteland. During this time, he apparently almost dies from both hunger and thirst. You would think that a kid who has grown up in a post apocalyptic world would be able to survive for a while on an empty stomach, but nope, Finn is such a drama queen that his world is just about ending. He is such an idiot. He's on his own for like, one day, and he goes on about being sooo hungry and sooo thirsty as if he hasn't eaten in weeks. Toughen up, apocalypse kid. Once he gets picked up by the looters he continues to be a little wimp. Afraid of everything, unable to defend himself, requires babysitting. In the gang there's the leader, a first generation man, and like 5 second generation girls (hmm, I wonder what goes on here at night time???). On their looting ventures, Finn seems to think that he has to protect these girls. Like, are you dumb? Finn has been out here for less than a week, and these girls have been looking after themselves for months, some of them years. The girls are perfectly capable of looking after themselves. Sure, I guess it's cute that Finn tries to look after them , but seriously - sit down before you hurt yourself, these girls don't need or want anything from you. I can't even write any more. There is an issue with \"Show, not Tell\" - the author feels the need to describe the 'night time activities' which Finn tries to protect the other girls from (\"Just pretend he's doing some exercises\" - freaking idiot, as if the girls haven't been dealing with this on an almost nightly basis before you came along, dumbass) anyway - the reader knows exactly what's going on next door, you don't need to describe it. Cringeworthy. Anyway, I guess I hated it. Stereotypical setting with dumb characters and dumb writing. The author over-describes everything. Finn is a whiney little pimple with apparently no survival skills despite living in a post-apocalyptic world. I don't even care that this review is badly written also. I don't even care what happens at the end. This book sucks. PLUS it's written in past tense, so obviously Mr Dumb Dumb somehow manages to survive."}, {"userName": "Jason Jauron", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26238200-jason-jauron", "userReview": "It was a competent enough read...But the zombie genre is a bloated genre...And this type of zombie-post-nuclear-savage lands-point of view-survival, etc has just been done better by a myriad of other authors.Not a horrible book, but it just doesn't stack up to its peers."}, {"userName": "Cathryn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5028851-cathryn", "userReview": "7/14/15: $1.99 on Amazon Kindle."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6305538-dan", "userReview": "http://geekpronblog.blogspot.com/2015..."}, {"userName": "Rich Mintz", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45976141-rich-mintz", "userReview": "Look.

Positive is the story of the zombie apocalypse decades after it wrecked havoc on humanity. Finn has no clue what it was like out there in the world when the zombies started popping up. He doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to fight of hordes, be terrified all the time, or watch people get attacked. He grew up in a city that\u2019s well protected from zombies. They grow their own food, and lead a normal life. However, when his mom suddenly becomes a zombie, Finn\u2019s life is forever changed. Since the zombie virus can remain dormant for up to 20 years, they have no way of knowing whether of not his mother came in contact with the virus before, during, or after her pregnancy with Finn. So, to be on the safe side, the authorities tattoo Finn\u2019s hand, marking him a \u201cpositive\u201d to let others know that he may be infected, and they ship him off to a positives only camp. However, when he goes to meet the government escort, they\u2019re dead, and Finn is left to navigate the hostile world alone, in the hopes of surviving long enough to find the camp.Like I said, usually you read about a current zombie outbreak, or maybe something that is relatively recent. However, you have generations that were around before there were areas that could contain it\u2019s population and keep the zombies out. Then you have Finn\u2019s generation who are completely oblivious to what\u2019s going on in the world. So, needless to say, Finn comes across some very unpleasant things while on the road. He comes across road pirates, looters, military who treat him like the scum of the earth, and has some harsh realities thrown in his face. It took a while for Finn to grow up and stop being naive but I was proud of the progress he made by the end of the story.I don\u2019t want to say too much and give away all the key points of the story but I will say that the final conflict of the novel was very well written. Normally you have this huge build up throughout the whole book and then when the moment finally comes, it\u2019s over in the blink of an eye. The author took his time playing out the final scene, it went on for chapters. It was very well thought out and I really like the fact that he took the time to really give it the attention and detail it deserved because you knew the story was building up to this moment.I have actually had this book sitting on my shelf for a couple of years now and I feel bad that I haven\u2019t read it sooner. I\u2019m not a huge zombie person and I wasn\u2019t overly sure if I\u2019d ever be in the mood for a novel where a kid walks through Zombie-land for hundreds of pages. However, it kind of has more to do with humanity and who he comes in contact with, than it did the actual zombies. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they were still there, but I was always more afraid of the living characters than the undead ones. I think because of that, I was really invested in the story."}, {"userName": "Lisa Flores", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51810914-lisa-flores", "userReview": "I already was a fan of David Wellington.
