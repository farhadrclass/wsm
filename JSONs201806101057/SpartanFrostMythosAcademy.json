For as much as I complain about all of these side stories with series....it's Logan. He's my Dimka 2.0. I'll take it! Post Read thoughts :I'll keep this short and sweet, since the page count is small and I don't want to write something as long as the read itself.Being in Logan's head was not what I'd expected. I wanted to see more of his thoughts toward Gwen, but other than going back to what he was doing at the end of book 4 (which wasn't really a romantic moment) and a slight measure of time past that, I didn't get any sort of big insight about Gwen through his eyes. Was this a must-read for the series? Probably not. No reader is going to be lost if they go right from book 4 to book 5. This truly was an \"extra\" little snippet, and in a way I'm grateful for that. It's always preferable to keep the \"in between\" shorts optional for the reader. I wasn't going to miss it though because I will take my Logan scraps, thank you very much.This was pretty much a quick and easy way to spend a few minutes, so I'm glad I had this to read while I had an awesome man in the kitchen making dinner for me. :pSpartan Frost was provided from the publisher through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Janus the Erudite Artist", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4552491-janus-the-erudite-artist", "userReview": "A story told in the eyes the alluring Logan Quinn? Who would pass off that chance? I know I wouldn\u2019t. Spartan Frost gives readers a glimpse of Logan\u2019s thoughts about everything that went on previously in Crimson Frost. Upon seeing the cover of this short story, my immediate reaction was: \u201cIt should have been Logan posing on the cover and not Gwen.\u201d Come on! How many times will Logan get his own book? This could be the only one, right? I\u2019d be happy to see more but let\u2019s face it this is the first we\u2019ll see him speak up his mind, why not give it all already? It really is more appropriate to have his face plastered there.I\u2019m a little confused about his point-of-view. I mean, it is said to be Logan speaking but it seems to me that the narrative still sounds a lot like Gwen. \u201c...Black hair, blue yes, nice smile, muscles in the right places...\u201d Really? What guy says that about his own body? It\u2019s either Logan\u2019s narcissistic or the author hasn\u2019t quite worked out a way to detach the Gwen persona to form a different one for Logan. And does everyone really call him Logan \u201cfreaking\u201d Quinn? Even himself? That\u2019s just really weird.I must say Spartan Frost wasn\u2019t exactly an invigorating read but it wasn\u2019t that bad either. I got to see Logan and his Dad start having a closer relationship with each other, and I\u2019m happy for him. It\u2019s one of the things that he so dearly wants even if he doesn\u2019t say it. And the cliff-hanger ending, which actually gives no clue over what happened to Gwen [that pissed me off by the way], promises an event that would prove the Spartan\u2019s love for his Gypsy Girl. *Thank you, Kensington Books and NetGalley for the copy of Spartan Frost.For more of my reviews, please visit my blog: The Blair Book Project @ www.theblairbookproject.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6383594-tina", "userReview": "4 StarsI'm biased. I'll admit it now. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this series (and Logan ;)) so if you're not a fan of the series, ignore my rating because you'll probably disagree with it.I'm absolutely thrilled that we finally have a story (albeit it a short one) in Logan's POV. This, like all other series with a short story in between, was unnecessary, but it satisfies the curiosity of those who wonder what happened between the end of book 4 and the beginning of book 5. Logan is admittedly more distressed than I thought he'd be. I mean, not that I don't expect him to be utterly distressed about the events that transpired, but I didn't expect to see as much emotional outlet that I'd expect from a Spartan. However, I thought it was nice to see this side of Logan.If anything, there were more questions than answers in this short (CURSE YOU JENNIFER ESTEP!) so I'm desperately waiting for Midnight Frost to come out! If you haven't been a fan of the series so far, skip this book. If you love the series or just have to know every single detail that goes on, read it!"}, {"userName": "Liliana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4199142-liliana", "userReview": "Reviewed on Lili Lost in a BookOh man, this novella? It was AMAZEBALLS! I *heart* LoganFor being a novella, this book seriously pulled out SO many emotions out of me! And I love a book with emotion! For one, Logan had me swooning from page one...not surprising though. He is Logan Freaking Quinn. He might have that tough guy/bad boy attitude going on, but underneath all that is just a really sweet, loving guy.Throughout the novella he keeps tormenting himself for what he did to Gwen in Crimson Frost,\u00a0and it makes me feel SO sad! What he went through then (damn you Loki!) and what he's going through now...Oh my feels!It is SO great that Jennifer made this novella! After him leaving in Crimson Frost, we finally get to be inside Logan's head and see his reasoning for this! We also get to see his POV of his fight with Gwen and his internal fight with Loki.There was so much insight, emotion, and action. We actually get to see him go after some reapers and artifacts.Anyway, It was just a perfect short story to satisfy our Mythos Academy need until the release of Midnight Frost.

A novella from my favourite character. The gorgeous, protective, swoon-worthy Logan Quinn. I was utterly heartbroken at the end of Crimson Frost. I genuinely couldn't believe it. My beautiful Logan being taken over by Reapers really had to have messed with his head and I was utterly heartbroken that he had left Mythos Academy and Gwen.Jennifer Estep had really set up grounds where readers could have turned on Logan. Leaving Gwen at a time like this how could he? But that is what Spartan Frost really changed. She made us see Logan's side as to why he left and I really loved seeing things from his point of view... his love for Gwen... his hurt that he hurt her so badly... and why he needed time away from it all.I loved this novella and it really made me fall even more in love with Mythos. I wish it had been a bit longer and I wish maybe we had seen him go back to Mythos... if he goes back... no I am refusing to believe that he will not reappear in the next book so yeah... I'd have liked for it to last a little bit longer and maybe if he had gone back to Mythos Academy in it we'd have seen a scene between him and Gwen as I would have loved to get that in Logan's point of view.It was a perfect novella and I can't wait to jump into the next Mythos Academy book...

Why Logan isn't on the cover? It's his novella, so he should be there! ( I know, I know, I'm complaining because I wanted to see hot male cover model, not because I don't like that one...) My love for Mythos Academy started about two years ago, when I'd read Touch of Frost, fantastic start to this exciting, unique and dynamic series, that follows Gwen Frost and her fight with evil mitological creatures. You can imagine my happiness when I first heard about Logan's ( Gwen's love interest) novella. I almost fainted because of this news! I mean, hello, our alpha male Spartan will get his words in Mythos Academy, and after tragical end of Crimson Frost it was everything I could dream of.  I expected Spartan Frost to be heartbreaking confession of Logan's feeling and exposure of his hidden secrets or just a taste of his awesomness , meanwhile I got 47 pages of Logan's short escapade with Protectorate. And that made me humpf. I mean, I was like \"why?\". I had made bad assumptions, which led me to believe, that this novella will be psychological portet of Spartan, and unfortunately it was not. In return, I got an badass adventure and small glimpses of Logan's feeling toward Gwen. Which made me not fully satisfied. In my opinion, Spartan Frost is a must read for every fan of Logan freakin' Quinn, there is no doubt about it, but if you are not, then it could be waste for you.Now, I'm really itching for Midnight Frost!

After what happened in Crimson Frost, Logan and his father moved to their home in New York to put a little distance between Logan and Gwen. Understandable that he'd be afraid to be around her right now, but completely cutting her off when he still keeps in contact with their mutual friends? I don't know about that...seems like something only a jerk would do. But I guess the whole point of this novella is to make Logan decide if he'll return to the campus in North Carolina, or cut ties and move forward at the New York campus. At least in New York, he's able to join his father and other members of the Protectorate and go after Loki's Reapers, and we all know how much he'd like to kill every single one of them.

But Jennifer Estep\u2019s Spartan Frost was really enjoyable. After the crushing ending of Crimson Frost, I enjoyed the glimpse into the few days of Logan\u2019s life. Fair warning, if you have not read Crimson Frost (Book 4), or any of the other books, I would stop reading to avoid any spoilers. Normally, I would try to write this spoiler free, but the nature of the story somewhat prevents it.Logan Quinn is a Spartan at Mythos Academy. Beyond that, he is a Spartan that the Reapers have chosen to merge Loki\u2019s soul with. At the end of Crimson Frost, he was taken under control, to do what he never thought he could do \u2013 kill Gwen Frost. Spartan Frost retells the last few moments of Crimson Frost, and then proceeds almost immediately after those gut-wrenching events. Logan has removed himself from Gwen, his friends, and the rest of Mythos Academy. He sets out to train and to get a new outlook on his priorities. But if Logan thinks he can run away from the Reapers, he has to think again.Even though I only get a glimpse of Logan\u2019s perspective, I feel like it was a good addition to the series. I was able to understand Logan and who he is, much more than what I already see. From the rest of the books, I have this idea of him and what I interpret as Estep\u2019s intentions, but reading Spartan Frost has brought this other side of him that I normally would not see.Estep kept the same familiar tone in Spartan Frost as she had in the previous books. This novella was really a nice extension of the stories. I appreciated the continuation of the world that I have grown to love. The content was well balanced and did its job well. Estep gave all the attributes of a regular story (action scene, meaningful ah-hah! moment, and a conclusion) but within the nice comfort of these pages.I enjoyed Spartan Frost, and I think you will also.Notable Scene:More anger raged through me, burning away the last echoes of Loki\u2019s laughter and everything else but my desire to hurt every Reaper in the entire ski resort.\u201cLogan?\u201d Dad asked again.\u201cCome on,\u201d I said, my voice even harsher than before. \u201cLet\u2019s keep moving.\u201dI shouldered my way past him, Inari, and Sergei and started forward once more.\u201cLogan, wait\u2014\u201c Dad called out in a soft voice.But it was too late.Because three Reapers stepped out of the room right in front of me.FTC Advisory: Kensington Teen provided me with a copy of Spartan Frost.

I was furious with him for his choices at the end of Crimson Frost, so I felt like this novella was going to be the perfect look into his head to see what was going on, and maybe understand him better. Honestly though now that I've read it, I have to say my excitement wasn't exactly warranted. I guess I was just hoping for more than this novella allowed. I mean sure we got to see inside his head, but honestly it wasn't anything I hadn't already figured out from his prior actions via Gwen's perspective. Don't get me wrong, I understand that the guy is broken up about what he did while being possessed, but I just don't think that warranted nor excused his sudden emo behavior. Also the fact that he kept in touch with their other friends and kept asking them about how Gwen was, yet wouldn't even answer her calls, really infuriated me. I'm hoping that this depression of his gets out of his system soon as I like Gwen thought she could always count on him, and he's really let her down.I've always been a big fan of novellas in a series and short stories as it is always nice to have those little extras that just don't have a place in the full length books. Yet, I'm not sure this one was quite necessary. Would I recommend this novella?
