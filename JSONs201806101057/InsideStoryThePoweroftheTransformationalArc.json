Inside Story stands far above anything so far that I have read because it offers a unique language for story that blends together psychology, and plot in a way that I have never seen in any other book. The Hero's Journey is far more than just a sequence of events, and Dara breaks that out in this book beautifully. This is a must have book in my opinion if you write screenplays, or novels and short stories."}, {"userName": "Abigail Bok", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32345761-abigail-bok", "userReview": "Dara Marks is a highly regarded \u201cscript doctor\u201d\u2014for the uninitiated that means someone hired to make a mediocre movie or TV script better. She also has a doctorate in mythological studies, which gives her as you might imagine a long-horizon perspective on the art of storytelling. In Inside Story: The Power of the Transformational Arc she marries her two areas of expertise to offer a step-by-step guide to producing a script that holds the potential for a moviegoing experience that will stay with viewers long after the movie ends.I am not a screenwriter or even an aspiring one, but this book is rich in useful advice for novelists like me, or in fact for anyone telling a story. This is no \u201cscreenwriting made easy\u201d guide, with outdated tips about margin size, typefaces, and what kind of brackets to use around stage directions. Marks\u2019s focus is lasered in on how to shape a story\u2014what you tell at which stage, how to create characters that viewers can attach to, how to develop and sustain a strong theme, in short how to make a story meaningful, no matter what genre you are writing in. As she amply demonstrates, her advice works equally well for action-adventure stories as for romantic comedies, thrillers, or tragedies. To do this she starts each chapter with a generalized concept, such as building a character or identifying your underlying theme, and after discussing the concept in broad terms, she gives examples from well-known films. The way she analyzes movies most people will recognize is one of the most enlightening and valuable aspects of this book: she explains why a particular story works and why it doesn\u2019t, where the author is doing something right and where he or she has gone astray. Later in the book she takes the reader through the arc of a story step by step, revealing what\u2019s important at each stage\u2014the concept-establishing first act, the busy and eventful second act, and the cathartic and transformative third. Her advice moves seamlessly from the general to the particular and back to the general, illuminating both the mechanics and the uniqueness of any story. It\u2019s not just a how-to, but a why-to.I found this book tremendously valuable in its approach, full of both thought-provoking and actionable advice. I recommend it for anyone who tells stories, regardless of your genre or medium."}, {"userName": "Darya Conmigo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2376222-darya-conmigo", "userReview": "Are you in the Known or Unknown quadrant in your life at this very moment? Dying of exhaustion or approaching renewal? Does your C story help you or prevent you from getting ahead in your A story? Those are the kinds of questions I asked myself as I was reading Dara Marks\u2019s book.I am not a script writer but I am a great believer in interdisciplinarity. I read this book for thoughts on writing in general and also because it talks a lot about how transformation occurs in life. For those purposes, it was a great reading.Excited as I was about the material, I was actually arguing a lot with the book when it came to the movies. The author is infinitely more informed on the topic than I am, however she seems to write about Hollywood movies primarily. I believe that in some great indie movies, particularly by younger directors/screenwriters, different kind of magic is at work. I would also love to see more on TV series screenwriting - the story there has move protagonists (think Game of Thrones) and much more time to develop, so surely the process is somewhat different.What was great though is how therapeutic the reading was. Script writing distills from life and then this knowledge can be used in life again when each of us embarks on our own transformational journey."}, {"userName": "Boze Herrington", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63318807-boze-herrington", "userReview": "\"When we say that a person has depth or soul, it is usually in reference to someone who has been to these depths and has retrieved the lost pieces of themselves.

At first I wasn't impressed, really, but I have to admit that when it gets technical it is definitely worth reading.

There is just so much to take in and absorb from this book that I'm reading it a second time.

Ironically enough, it's a book for screenwriters on thematic intention and developing a transformational arc. In a query letter to agents, a writer needs to summarize their book in one or two sentences. A lot must be conveyed in those two sentences, which is really hard to do. But it's also really important, not only to quickly pique an agent's interest, but also for the author to come back to their writing and decide which plot points should stay and which should go. Each step is a learning process. What was the cost/benefit analysis of this book? 300+ pages of reading and 30+ pages of notes helped me conceptualize two sentences. It seems like a lot of work for little results, but now I know. And now I have those two sentences."}, {"userName": "Kevin Rhodes", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69009644-kevin-rhodes", "userReview": "I try not to be too much of a wannabe in choosing which screenwriting and storytelling books to read, but this one came highly recommended and has proven to be an essential. It offers specific, grind-it-out/do the work advice on what works and what doesn't, but beyond that, it fully captures the transformational story arc. (That's what I write -- more than that, it's what I live.) The combination is hugely powerful -- it combines skill sharpening with professional and personal growth. And Dara Marks does it all with welcome doses of empathy, sympathy, and sometimes gorgeous prose that makes you put the book down and take a moment to let it soak through your soul."}, {"userName": "Giovanna Barbieri", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27773133-giovanna-barbieri", "userReview": "Finito ieri sera.

Dara Marks, originally a script consultant, lays the process of breaking down the components of storytelling into sensible chunks and then delves into the \"why\" within fiction. Touching on the myth or archetypes of characters, she uncovers the different strands, lines, that simutaneously evolve internally and externally. Again and again, from a simple view of structure, Ms. Marks continues to add more and more components enriching plot by defining themes/premise, defining character needs and want, problmes (obstacles and flaws). This doesn't mean that absorbing her ideas was easily done, on the first pass. To chew and digest, piece by piece required plug and play as well as moments of contemplation or not self-evaluation. Critical. Work. Yet if done during the writing process, oh brother, did my own story take on a richer, layered effect. Ms. Marks uses the three-act division so that it was possible to move through examples provided (movies) and then apply to my own writing, pushing my own characters and plot into a sensible boost and then rotation so that, a glimmer at least, of an arc (change for the better) was delivered. I've read this book twice and still go back, returning and come away with another morsel."}, {"userName": "Paula", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1300439-paula", "userReview": "This is a decent book about writing a character driven story line. It was interesting. The author does the job of pointing out the various places in the plot line in which the character arc and the external plot arc need to achieve crisis. The weak point in the book is that she adds a third arc that is about relationships. While it makes sense that the internal arc needs both an external plot as well as a relationship arc in order to exhibit growth or collapse, the author doesn't make this very clear. She uses confusing terminology, saying that the external plot and relationship need to play out the Theme she doesn't make clear how the Theme relates to the internal plot. Sometimes it seems as if they are the same thing, and sometimes two separate things on which all three story arcs depend. Overall, it is probably a useful read, but I wish the author had taken more care in clarifying her basic ideas."}, {"userName": "Jay", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24659816-jay", "userReview": "If I could give this six stars I would. There are few books I've read that add things so extremely important to my understanding of a topic. This book adds not one thing but several things.
