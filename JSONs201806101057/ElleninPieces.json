Me, because I\u2019ve been reading pieces of Ellen in Pieces in journals and magazines for the last few years, and hearing rumours they\u2019d culminate in an actual book, and how often are one\u2019s longings so perfectly satisfied? And you\u2019ve been waiting for this book, because I promise that it\u2019s one of the best you\u2019ll read this year. Devastating, wonderful and brilliant. Because aren\u2019t you always looking for a book to apply such adjectives to? Because I\u2019ve been longing to read this book for years, and when I did, it was even better than I\u2019d hoped.It\u2019s a novel in stories, or a collection of linked stories, or maybe a novel comprised of fragments, which is more like a life is than most novels I\u2019ve ever read. The first three \u201cchapters,\u201d I\u2019d read previously, and through which I\u2019d become entranced with Adderson\u2019s character, Ellen McGinty, divorced, determined, blundering, flawed, impulsive, hated, and loved. Because it\u2019s rare to encounter such a character in fiction, a woman in the middle years of her life, a woman who is not a type, who has history, is unsure of what to do with her present, who has a body, experiences lust, gets tired, loves her children, cannot stand her children, has friends, fights with her friends, who is herself with such remarkable specificity\u2014\u201dEllenish\u201d is a term applied at one point in the book, and I knew exactly what they meant. It is rare that a character is so vividly realized\u2014so familiar and yet utterly original at once.Caroline Adderson pays attention to words, which are as specific as her characters. No one else would write a sentence like, \u201cA melting weakness overtook her and she remembered all those years ago, not here but in Ellen\u2019s North Vancouver kitchen, how he glissaded out of the way so Georgia could set down her platter of blintzes.\u201d A platter of blintzes\u2014has there ever been such a thing? The world reinvented through Adderson\u2019s extraordinary, euphonic vocabulary.In the first chapter, \u201cI Feel Lousy\u201d, Ellen discover that her younger daughter, not even the disappointing one, is pregnant, which evokes memories of her own troubled past, an accidental pregnancy with her ex-husband, the terrible, awful burden of motherhood, single motherhood in particular, and the lengths that a mother will go to\u2014this mother in particular\u2014for her daughter\u2019s sake. \u201cPoppycock\u201d finds us a few years into the future, Ellen\u2019s estranged father on her doorstep, obviously suffering from some kind of malady and she\u2019s horrified to find him but also bowled over because he wants her, he needs her. She\u2019d assumed her family had written her off altogether since she\u2019d tried to sleep with her brother-in-law at her father\u2019s 50th birthday years before. But the past, just like the present, turns out to be more complicated than that, and the reappearance of her father is a gift that comes with a shadow, a particularly long one.And if you think that ending is devastating, read \u201cEllen-Celine, Celine-Ellen\u201d next, about Ellen and her two friends whose relationship was forged at pre-natal class years ago, Ellen all alone because her asshole husband Larry had just abandoned her (the first time). The three stay close in the decades to follow, Ellen and Celine taking a trip to Europe together, which is ill-advised, so say their other friend, Georgia, and also Ellen\u2019s hairdresser, Tony, because Ellen and Celine spend much of their friendship not being able to stand each other, a situated not mitigated by their strong personalities, and also that of the three friends who\u2019d met in pre-natal class, it had been Celine\u2019s baby that died.Have I conveyed that these stories of death and crisis, all the drama of a life, are also funny? Adderson portrays human behaviour at the intersection of heroism and buffoonery, or else just irritability, to much effect. There\u2019s a subtlety at work here. There are lines that are going to come along and break your heart.The next few stories are more concerned with the present, pieces fitting more closely together. Ellen begins to find herself\u2014her daughters are settling down, or else calming down; she sells her house; she takes up pottery again; after years of searching, she is learning to be present. She also starts sleeping with a young man who is her daughters\u2019 age, which doesn\u2019t hurt. She thinks she\u2019s beginning to get over her ex-husband, Larry, whose desertion has wrung her heart for years and years.One chapter is from the point of view of Matt, Ellen\u2019s young lover, who is using Ellen to escape from his own troubled domestic situation. Another by Ellen\u2019s older daughter, Mimi, who has overcome her problems with addiction but is still searching for something to hold onto, and still running from her mother too, whose presence is still vividly felt even from halfway across the country in Toronto, currently in the midst of a garbage strike. (Mimi traces back most of her problems to having once discovered her mother in bed with her grade-five teacher, whom she\u2019d been in love with. Until that point.) Another word in this chapter, \u201correry\u201d, which recurs at the end of the story as Mimi rolls down a car window using a similar device. \u201cShe saw the moon, the faint stars vying for attention against the glare of human habitation. Pluto was up there somewhere, that small cold outcast planet far away. But there were people who still believed in it, people who wished it well.\u201dIf the story doesn\u2019t devastate you, I promise that the prose will.At the end of this chapter, Mimi finally gets an inkling of why her mother is who she is, with the aid of a handy Bryan Adams lyric. Maternal ambivalence is a two-way street, and Adderson\u2019s is a gut-wrenching depiction of its flip side. And then in the next chapter, \u201cMother-eye\u2014the curse cast on every birthing woman, the hex of self-sacrificing empathy. I will see your pain, but you will never see mine.\u201dIt\u2019s at the end of this chapter when Ellen is diagnosed with breast cancer, and I\u2019m going to tell you this, tell you this straight: Ellen dies.I am telling you this because it\u2019s revealed anyway in a tiny sentence on the back of the book (\u201c\u2026we watch Ellen negotiate the last year of her tumultuous life as the pieces of who she is finally come together.\u201d), and in the epigraph as well, and I am telling you this because if you aren\u2019t prepared, it might just be too terrible to take. When was the last time an author dared to kill off the central character in her novel and not even at the end of her novel\u2026\u2026and of course, Virginia Woolf did, in To the Lighthouse, which I read last month, and which I see as having all kinds of parallels with Adderson\u2019s book, although the two vary greatly in style (and Adderson\u2019s prose is devourable, while Woolf\u2019s must be savoured in measured portions). The notion of \u201ctime passes\u201d and that we see a character through the eyes of those around her, the mixture of love and dislike and what lies between which makes up most relationships, and she isn\u2019t even knowable to herself, because who has ever been so pinned down? That she a person whom people assemble around, in all her flaws and fallibility. If she is a solar system, here is the sun, and what happens after the light goes out?The death scene is sublime, written from the perspective of Ellen\u2019s young grandson, who has his own problems, and when I came to the paragraph break, I put down the book and sobbed and sobbed, and had to go find someone to comfort me\u2014it\u2019s rare that text on a page is ever this affecting. I was devastated, but also amazed at the beauty of the scene, of Adderson\u2019s writing\u2014it was perfect. Masterful.In the final stories of the book, Ellen\u2019s friends and family gather around her, offering richer perspectives on the scenes we\u2019ve already read. I was especially besotted with \u201cThe Something Amendment,\u201d from the perspective of Georgia, who is the third in Ellen\u2019s friendship with Celine. We\u2019ve previously known Georgia through her telephone conversations with Ellen, her jolly husband Gary chiming in from the background. As ever, however, the reality of life is more complicated than can be discerned from down a telephone wire, and Georgia\u2019s own relationship with Ellen is different from even what Ellen suspects, and one of the great achievements of Adderson\u2019s book, I think, is her rich portrayal of decades-long female friendships, the betrayals and compromises that are implicit in such relationships.If I have to go out of my way to find a criticism of the book, it would be that the Ellen herself is so compelling that the chapters in which she\u2019s at a distance are not as much\u2014the half-grownness of Ellen\u2019s lover is so bland compared to the presence of Ellen in her prime, although the characterization of him at home with his family is vivid, rich and surprising. Or maybe it\u2019s just that I think that Ellen could have done better?I don\u2019t hate that she died. I wish she hadn\u2019t, but I also didn\u2019t feel like Adderson was using cancer or death as a plot device, to manipulate her characters or (worse!) to manipulate her reader. If its confrontation with cancer and mortality, Ellen in Pieces is a companion to Oh, My Darling by Shaena Lambert, which I read last year (and Lambert is thanked in Adderson\u2019s acknowledgements; they share a publisher). It\u2019s a brave take on things, really, but typical, because the exquisite nature of the entire book comes from Adderson defying her readers\u2019 expectations, surprising you with every line, with every turn of the page."}, {"userName": "Carol Moreira", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18588323-carol-moreira", "userReview": "Caroline Adderson's Ellen is a marvellous character who deals with the turmoils and regrets of middle-age with an exuberant determination to seize life and guzzle. For the most part, the narrative structure--a series of short stories told from different points of view--worked well for me, but I found the structure less successful toward the end of the novel when I would have appreciated more time inside Ellen's head. Then, the structure became distancing for me. But Adderson is a marvellous writer--glorious imagery, wit and astute observations mean there is plenty to enjoy."}, {"userName": "Nicola", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10664133-nicola", "userReview": "I don't remember the last time I sobbed openly while reading a book nor connected so well with a character. The way Ellen is written makes me wish I knew her and could call her up for a coffee date. She's so unapologetically flawed and so genuine that she's the most authentic character I've read in a long time. I appreciated all the characters in the book for their flaws and their merits and I enjoyed the shifting POV's. To have the climatic chapters in Ellen's grandson's Eli's POV was sheer brilliance. It was those chapters that stabbed me right in the heart. The added bonus is that this book Canadian and it's uniquely Canadian flavour was the icing on the cake.

The tone was perfect, the voice of Ellen (reviewed to be an 'unlikeable' character, but I loved her) fresh and impossibly engaging. The novel is told in vignettes, chapters exploring different moments in Ellen's life. Some are from Ellen's point-of-view, others from her daughters', her ex-husband, her lover. Adderson captures these moments--sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, always authentic--in pitch-perfect prose. My only (small) quibble is that Ellen's voice got lost in Part Two, and I missed her. But not enough to love this novel any less."}, {"userName": "Sherry", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5652025-sherry", "userReview": "This novel is one to think about.

The title is a play on words. In the first sense, it\u2019s about the format: Ellen in Pieces is delivered through a series of linked stories that touch down on various periods in protagonist Ellen McGuinty\u2019s unruly life. In the second, Ellen is often figuratively in pieces, compromised by her huge appetites, occasional self-pity, a certain prickliness, and impulsiveness. She can be hard to take, but Adderson balances her all-too-human weaknesses with irresistible traits: Ellen goes after what she wants, and every time she stumbles she gets up again, tries again, and becomes new again. Also: she's exuberantly sexual and makes no apologies for this part of her energy.Ellen is one of the most finely drawn characters I can remember reading, and her ex-husband, Larry\u2014himself a major piece of work\u2014is also one I\u2019ve kept thinking about long after finishing the book.Back to the messiness of the book, and what I mean by it. The relatively loose, gamboling structure Adderson employs and the different Ellens we encounter along the way are perfectly suited for the portrayal of a middle-aged woman grappling with her loves, her failings, who she is and was, and everything life throws at her. Our lives aren\u2019t tidy, and this book does a masterful job of illuminating this, often with razor-sharp humour, sometimes with tear-your-heart-out pathos.I can\u2019t stop thinking about this book."}, {"userName": "Tanya Kyi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5058482-tanya-kyi", "userReview": "I know Caroline more through her children's books.

It really was a deep study in characters and setting but the plot was less exciting. The POV changing half way through the book was a bit disorienting. Although my favorite POV came from Ellen's young grandson, toward the end of the book, in general I found the changes in POV a little confusing and didn't necessarily add to the narrative. I sound critical, but this is my personal preference, and many may love the changes in character POVs. AS for the story, Ellen is in pieces throughout, not just in her middle age. I was frustrated with Ellen's choices to return to a man who treated her as second and third best...I just couldn't wrap my head around that. Then in the end, many characters seem to have some kind of epiphany about Ellen and demonstrate the love for her that would've come in handy in her younger years, as a single mom.Adderson's writing is phenomenal though and if you like to read books that are character driven and nuanced, rather than plot driven, then you'll love Ellen In Pieces."}, {"userName": "Jessica Raya", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34639125-jessica-raya", "userReview": "Discovering a new Canadian writer I love is always bittersweet.

A great read!"}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5427012-stephanie", "userReview": "An engaging and ridiculously accurate story of a middle aged woman who lives her young-hippy-life on \u2018Cordova Island\u2019 (clearly based on Hornby), her single-working-mother life on the North Shore, and her newly retired-pottery-artist life in Kitsilano. The setting is a great treat for those of us who know Vancouver and west coast living. The \u2018pieces of Ellen\u2019 reveal a complex woman who lives a complicated creative, generous and passionate life."}, {"userName": "Theresa Southam", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16338770-theresa-southam", "userReview": "I ate this book up over two days. A record for me these days. Its set so close to home - I grew up in the lower mainland of British Columbia. I relate to the hippy culture and I liked how Ellen found her way in the world authentically. No magic solutions- just learning to love herself - day by day."}], "description": "In this witty, compelling and genre-bending novel, a single mother navigates the loves, lusts and losses of middle age to arrive at a final, bittersweet contentment.Ellen McGinty: sexy, impulsive, loud-mouthed, chock full of regrets. In middle age she sells the house she raised her daughters in, slips off the shell of her old life, and steps out for a first, tentative foray into real contentment--directly into the path of a man twenty years her junior. Her story explodes into multiple points of view. Through the eyes of her lover, Matt, her ex-husband, Larry, her two daughters (one a former addict), her grandson, and a friend who both supports and betrays her, we watch Ellen negotiate the middle years of her tumultuous life as the pieces of who she is finally come together. In its entirety, Ellen in Pieces explores love in its varied forms, the nature of regret (and the possibility of recovery from it), and that greatest human test, mortality.Exquisitely written, absorbing and intelligent, this new novel by Caroline Adderson shows her at the top of her form. Ellen in Pieces is a deeply affecting story, an emotional mirror for all our lives.", "title": "Ellen in Pieces", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20764874-ellen-in-pieces", "average": 3.59, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1409352633l/20764874.jpg", "reviews": 92, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/184276.Caroline_Adderson", "name": "Caroline Adderson"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Contemporary", "Abandoned", "Novels"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20764874-ellen-in-pieces", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22663010-ellen-in-pieces", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18406701-norman-speak", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12452818-jasper-john-dooley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2770776-sitting-practice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23600172-eat-leo-eat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12452819-middle-of-nowhere", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
