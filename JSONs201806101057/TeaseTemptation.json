I think all the fans of this series and these men were excited that we were getting more Tate and Logan, but we were all also very nervous about where Ella was going to go with the story. Then there was a lot of different ratings popping up on my feed and that made me even more hesitant to read this. There was even a few Dnf's! That scared the crap outta me and so I put it off a bit more. Than I finally said enough! Read the damn book and make up your own mind. Plus, it's Logan and Tate. You know you're gonna read it. lol So I did and I am happy to be on the list of the ones who enjoyed it.I know a lot of people had problems with how much sex was in the book over how much story there was. But I think some forgot this is Logan and Tate. In every book there has been a lot of sex. These men are sex. They are the epitome of what sex is. Their foreplay lasts for pages. They literally have to have their hands on each other no matter where they are or who is around. The boys want it and need it all the time. Who could blame them with how they are both described. (; Would I have liked more actual story than sex? Um, YES! I mean you gotta have a story and while there was some other things going on in between all the sex, it wasn't enough. You need more story Ella. We know these guys can sex it up and be hotter than hell, but we need more substance. I do at least. I think I just expected more than what I got. But I still loved it.I think this book was just a bit of an introduction of what is to come in the next books and I am excited for them. I loved getting to see where Tate and Logan both are now and seeing how successful Tate's bar ended up being. And I loved the name of his bar. It was just so fitting. I loved that we got to connect and see how Cole and Rachel are doing. Their little girl and boy were adorable and I couldn't help but swoon at how cute Logan and Tate were with them. I think after reading this we are all expecting a book about Robbie and Priest. I can't wait for that one. I'm happy one of my favorite couples is back and I can't wait to read what's next for them. Hopefully the future books will have more story and just the right amount of steam. Happy reading dolls! xx"}, {"userName": "Lana \u2747\u273eDirty Girl Romance\u2747\u273e", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498948-lana-dirty-girl-romance", "userReview": "3.5 STARS\n\nI love you so damn much. I can\u2019t believe there was ever a time when I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMother.Effing.Swoon.This couple! I can't even form words right now. I fell hard for both these men Try and I haven't looked back. I loved being a part of their journey and couldn't get enough of them. But I also have a confession to make. When I find out they'll be getting more books? I wasn't so excited. Now now, before you start throwing tomatoes, allow me to explain. See, I'm what you'd call an ADD reader. I'll be reading along just fine and then...SQUIRREL!Yeah. That. Basically what I'm trying to say is that I'm not a reader that enjoys trilogies or long standing series about the same couple because I find myself getting bored or losing my steam and enthusiasm about the characters after a while. If I feel like they got their HFN or HEA, I'm good with it. I want to move on to something else. And since we got a satisfying HEA for Tate and Logan in Trust, I moved on. I was terrified that we'd get some drama thrown into the mix that will totally kill their HEA for me in this book, but you know what? I couldn't be more wrong and I'll gladly eat a slice of crow as I write this review.Tease takes place four years after Trust. Logan and Tate are as happy together as they were but life is always getting in the middle. Between both of their successful careers, they find they don't have as much time for each other and Logan is determined to fix that.\n\nYou\u2019re always here when I need you the most.\u201d Logan let his hand fall away so he could take hold of Tate\u2019s, and once their fingers were entwined, he brought them to his lips, kissed them, and said, \u201cWhere else would I be? You\u2019re where my heart is. So that\u2019s where I stay.\u201d\n\nHave you found yourself wondering about a few of the loose ends after Trust? I know I have. I wanted more from Tate's family and to truly get some closure on that side. I love the route that Ella Frank chose to take in this book in getting the reader just that. It isn't perfectly wrapped in a bow for you but it's real, and it was touching, and I absolutely loved it.As for the rest? I loved catching up with my boys. They're just as sizzling together as they were in the last books, only they're more swoony now because there's nothing taking away from their love for each other.So why not a higher rating? While I loved getting to catch up with the boys and the rest of the gang; Rachel, Cole, and a surprising appearance from someone else (who I'm hoping will be getting a book), it just wasn't enough to keep me glued to the pages. I found myself skimming some of the sex scenes, as hot as they were, hoping for a little more meat to the story (no pun intended). The story began to get overshadowed a bit by the (crazy hot) sex scenes, and while I'm actually ashamed of myself for complaining about this, I can't help the way I feel. I appreciated that there was no crazy drama or conflict to take away from anything. It was simply a look into one of my favorite couples and what happens after the HEA. It gave the reader a chance to catch up with the boys and to see where their lives are now four years later. This book was very appropriately titled, because it's exactly what it was. A tease. A tease of a peek into Tate and Logan's life and what's to come.

I mean, they will always be one of my favorite couples in ALL of the romance genres, but revisiting them again after all this time was the best gift EVER!! I read EVERY word, no skimming because WHO WOULD DO THAT?! Like seriously, if you don't soak up every word of this book, I question your sanity because hello, it's Logan and Tate! We started this journey with Logan and Tate four years ago, when they first crossed paths and broke through barriers to start a beautiful journey together, I also joined on this journey with them as a reader. So it's kind of crazy that Tease takes place literally four years after the first book was released. With both Logan and Tate's careers at their peak, they're feeling pulled too much in the wrong direction. Realizing how hard it is to make their relationship a priority, they make strides to rectify this immediately! It's hilarious how after all this time that Logan is still surprised at the fact that Tate knows him so well, like he's shocked that he's still in a committed relationship. His insecurities still linger just below the surface and Tate handles him SO well. They really are perfect for each other, like when bossy Tate comes out it makes Logan crazy(in the best way!) and I just ADORE how balanced they make each other!Omg can this woman write a sex scene or what?! Talk about the best slow burning, sensual, sexy as hell, hot and bothered thing you will read between two people! The pure carnal desire that these two have for each other is like some sublime force that will never die and never get old. Never. Ever. Tate with his silky curls and Logan and his smart mouth, and their sexy banter filled with sexual innuendos and puns. NEVER. GETS. OLD. All of the characters you know and love are back, along with some we don't love so much, and some newbies too! We get to really see who they are today and how they've grown and evolved, and how that intertwines with Logan and Tate's life present day. One of these moments was extremely emotional for me and that just proves what the power of a fictional story can do for a very real life, I was surprisingly moved by a certain scene and I found it to be very therapeutic for me personally. And I think with this book specifically, that will happen for a lot of readers for several different reasons. That's why I love books so much, because reconnecting with these characters feels just like coming home. When Ella Frank announced that we were getting THREE more books in the Temptation series, I just about had a heart attack, and I cried tears of joy, like legitimate tears running down my face. Tease was done SO well, and in my opinion, was a great beginning of a continuation-story that promises to be a great ride! I'm beyond excited to see what the next book in the series has to offer us lucky readers. So thank you Ella, for taking me back to my happy place with Logan and Tate, it was such a warm comfy place to be (and totally hot too). True fans of these guys will absolutely devour this book, and you should because it's AMAZING and wonderful and ALL the adjectives."}, {"userName": "Jaime", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9959276-jaime", "userReview": "- 3 Stars It was great reading about L&T again... catching up with them...although I know there will be two other books, I am kind of let down with this ending ...

God. GOD. I have no idea where to start, I'm a mess. *takes a deep breath*It's always so hard to do a book justice with your review if you love the characters and their journey like I adore these two. From the first book on Ella Frank's spellbinding, charismatic heroes of her Temptation series took my heart away and have refused to give it up again ever since. When I heard that this author would continue her amazing MM Romance I squealed. And did the Carlton dance.Of course, there is always a bit of apprehension when an author decides to continue with the story of a couple he or she left in a happy place. So you might wonder if these books are necessary. Well, if you remember, there were a couple loose ends in the last three books I definitely think that there is enough material there to continue writing more Logan & Tate. The story starts around four years after we left them. I am not going into plot details because I think the experience will be even better if you go in blind. Just trust Ella that she will do right by them. What I can say, however, is that Logan and Tate are in a good place. They love each other unconditionally, are devoted and as committed as commitment-phobe Logan allows. And Tate is more than OK with that - he has Logan's utter devotion and it's going both ways.Logan is his usual arrogant and filterless self but there is a new layer of, let's call it maturity, to him that makes him so absolutely irresistible. For all his cockiness he always looks out for Tate. He gives his best friend and lover room to work out his problems. Logan is the most endearing when he shows his sweet side, which mostly his bartender is on the receiving end of. And he has a ginormous heart. Logan is also so utterly adorable when he shows his insecurities and worries. But all this together makes this complicated man so human and wonderful. And it doesn't hurt that he is hot AF. In clothes and in bed.Tate is still the easy-going, considerate and level headed and wonderful man. He calms the storm in Logan and always knows the right things to say when the love of his life needs reassurance. Tate isn't any less captivating. He stands his ground with the intense Logan. The curly gorgeous man knows how much his lawyer loves to be teased and makes use of this knowledge often. Which more often than not lands them both in bed. And holy moly, when Tate gets authoritative and commanding it's like my Kindle catches fire. This guy's heart is just as big as Logan's.Together they are like a well oiled machine. They just work. Their sexual attraction is strong as ever and so primal, raw and hot. They play rough but they play, what comes out of their mouths is positively filthy. It will leave you panting but coming back for more. But they can also be sweet and tender with each other and I have yet to decide which side of Logan and Tate I love more. They are just perfect and I'd totally be the turkey in their sandwich if they asked me. We get to catch up with Cole and Rachel. I loved to see them again with their kids and how close they have become with Logan and Tate. We also see a familiar name return in this story and a new one and I have strong suspicion that we will see a new series or book about them in the future. Yes, we do get some reminders of events from the first three books but I found those necessary to ultimately move this story forward. The banter is, as always, hilarious.Ella Frank can throw any book at me and I'll gladly read it. I can completely immerse myself in her stories and don't want to come up for air. Now the waiting begins for the next part in Tate's and Logan's journey.

Just like for many Logan & Tate are one of my favorite couples. I loved Try and Take and as for Trust that was just ok for me. The story had kind of petered out by the time book 3 came out. That should've given an indication that Tease wasn't for me but because I do love these guys, and I was interested to see what the author would do with their story I gave it a shot. What did I think? That it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. It was just ok. There wasn't much going on, to be honest. I understand not wanting to add contrived drama, but there has to be something new happening. This was basically rehashing some stuff, catching up with past characters, and sex- lots of sex. Not even the sex was enough to keep me captivated. And the end, we're kind of just left there.

When I heard that Ella Frank was adding Tease and additional books to the series, I totally freaked out. More Tate and Logan? Don\u2019t mind if I do. Then this nagging thought crept in. What if their HEA is totally screwed up by a ton of drama? The story takes place four years after the end of Trust. It\u2019s amazing to see how far along Tate\u2014the formerly adamantly straight man\u2014has come in openly embracing his sexual orientation. He and Logan are still very much together, but their busy lives leave few opportunities for quality time. That doesn\u2019t sit well with either of them.The problem with the story isn\u2019t too much drama; it\u2019s the lack of sufficient conflict. There simply isn\u2019t enough substance to further the plot, so many times it feels as if not much is actually happening. Logan\u2019s insecurity is the main issue. Despite Tate\u2019s reassurances, Logan, who is the King of Cocky, constantly worries that Tate will leave him. They live together and enjoy their monogamous, committed relationship, yet the actual word \u201ccommitment\u201d makes Logan break out in a sweat. I like the contradictions in his personality.It\u2019s lovely to see them together and know that their connection is even more intense than before. I did find it hard to believe (no pun intended) that their perpetual state of arousal is so strong that they have to hide their erections whenever they are near each other. Literally. I could have done with a little less horniness and a little more plot, but Logan and Tate do exude fun, tenderness, and fabulous chemistry. They remain one of my favorite book couples. I really enjoyed catching up with the series\u2019 entertaining and integral side characters. I hope the supporting characters will increasingly impact the storyline as the series continues. Finding out what\u2019s been going on at Tate\u2019s bar, The Popped Cherry, was also quite nice because it hadn\u2019t even opened yet in the previous book. I have no complaints about the quality of the writing, and I did enjoy reading Tease. It certainly satisfied my Tate and Logan fix. I just expected more content. The book ends with some unfinished business left dangling. I continue to be a fan of this great series, and I am looking forward to reading what happens next.Recommended for fans of:The Temptation seriesM/M romanceLawyersBartendersRead the full review on the blog: http://readingfrenzyblog.com/tease-by-ella-frank/"}, {"userName": "~**Anna**~ A Romance Reader", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61292418-anna-a-romance-reader", "userReview": "*4.5 stars* \u201cI love you so damn much.

I know some romance readers don't like revisiting established couples over and over, especially when the plot - like this one - simply follows the couple in their day-to-day lives, with little angst or drama to drive the story forward, but for me, this is when I'm in my zone!I found this 4th installment of the Temptation series absolutely perfect in its simplicity. The story just follows Logan and Tate through their daily lives, four years after the original trilogy takes place. It was great to see them thriving in their relationship and in their professional lives. They've still got it, too. Boy, do they ever! Their chemistry is still burning hot and their love is so well-established that diving into this story was like putting on my favourite comfy sweater - it just fit and felt amazing. It was also great to revisit some of the other much loved secondary characters, including Robbie, who stole a lot of the spotlight for me and who now needs to get his own spin-off, pretty please with a cherry on top!!! Plus, Cole and Rachel's children were damn cute, too, and I look forward to seeing more interactions between them and \"Unca\" Tate and Uncle Logan. The promise of what's to come next for my favourite M/M couple might just kill me with extreme anticipation, but thankfully, I have 4 books to re-read and keep me occupied in the meantime."}, {"userName": "Rachel Reads Ravenously", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14514998-rachel-reads-ravenously", "userReview": "3.5 stars!   \"You're where my heart is. So that's where I stay.\"  Try by Ella Frank was my first ever MM novel. In fact, I went into it not even knowing it was MM. After a while I had thought, where's the love interest? Yeah. That was my dumb blonde moment. I ended up loving that book and it opened up a new world of romance for me. I love Tate and Logan and will read anything involving the two of them.Tease takes place about four years after the original trilogy and we get to see what is happening in the \"domesticated\" lives of Tate and Logan. Both have been busy with work, and when Logan realizes this, he demands they make more time for each other.I like that this book cleared up lose ends from the last book, things I definitely had questions about and some resolutions I never expected to get, so I was very happy for those. Why not a higher rating? I felt the pacing was off and I was skimming through the hot parts. I wish we had gotten more plot than hot, and it's how I also felt about book 3. Again, I did enjoy this book and the fact that we got answers, it was just a bit too slow and didn't hold my attention as well as books 1 and 2 did.PS I am dying for the next book after the end of this one. So Ella still has me hooked!  \"Forever's a long time.\"\"What?

Thank goodness that didn't happen!!This book was set 4 years into their relationship, which is what I'm always asking for...we get to just sit back and see what happens next. I love it when Justin Timberlake's character in the movie Friends with Benefits says what happens next after the rom com ends is porn....we get a taste of that here. Tate and Logan definitely burn up the pages, and it is pron-a-rificly HOT!I quite honestly loved that their biggest problem was not having enough time together, and that was simply because of their busy lives. Watching them with Cole and Rachel's kids...man that right there was swoon worthy!! Not sure where there still is to go and what could possible be left to fill two more books, I will happily read along...but please..for the love of all that is holy...don't let there be crazy stupid drama!!

Very little happened in this book plot-wise. And I'm big on the plot thing, but.......It's LOGAN and TATE. Four years later. And they're hotter, and happier, and more in love than ever. They also have lots of hot sex. So....how can I not love it?Logan is one of my favorite characters ever--probably because he's such an ass. And Tate...I keep thinking he's the sweet one in the relationship, but then he's just as alpha and dirty as Logan.Well written (aside from the lack of any type of plot) and featuring one of my favorite couples with zero angst.

So of course I need to see what had Ella plan out for another 3 books. Seriously, I think is a difficult feat especially for a contemporary romance. There isn't any suspense with villains or people dying or running through the continent for your lives, for example KA Merikan series with the same couple, going on six books now and everything is still so exciting. Is hard to find any excitement in the domesticated lives of Logan and Tate, unless they bring in the bad guys or girls.I don't think there is anything new that Ella bring forth. They are still in love with each other, they still loves indulging on sexual innuendos all the time, we get to see Cole having a 2.5 kids with the whole white picket fence, we revisit Tate's family and so on. I guess the most exciting part was reading about new character Priestly and one of the old character, Robbie. I'm definitely down for reading their story. Am I going to read the next two book?
