If you've ever doubted the power of one moment, you won't after reading this. Ms. Kingsbury is without question the best in Christian fiction, delivering a powerful message that does not come across as preachy or ignore the realities in life. No goody-two-shoes characters cripple her prose. Real people struggle with their faith issues and come out closer to God and each other because of it."}, {"userName": "Tiana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1365962-tiana", "userReview": "I've been putting off writing my review on this book because I'm not sure what to say. Generally, I don't especially like Christian fiction. This book is an example of why I don't like it. The story felt contrived and forced, like the author tried to imagine everything that could possibly go wrong and made it happen. I just kept feeling frustrated that the characters weren't using common sense to prevent these horrible things from happening. But worse was that I felt like the author was trying to make a political statement that I was neither going to appreciate nor agree with. In the end though, she surprised me and came to a conclusion that was better than I had given her credit for. So I ended up giving it 3 stars because the author showed a broader sense of tolerance than I thought she would. If you like Christian fiction, you will probably like this book because it's pretty much the epitome of Christian fiction. If you're not a Christian fiction fan, I would steer clear of this one..."}, {"userName": "Tracey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10484431-tracey", "userReview": "Let me start by saying that had I known this was Christian fiction I may not have picked it up to begin with. I sometimes find the religious writing a little too over-the-top for my liking. I had a couple of issues with this story line:1.The parents of these two teenagers conspire against them by taking deliberate steps to separate them from each other. One family moves across the country and the other into the suburbs and neither leaves a forwarding address. My issue ... the author implies that had they had God in their lives they would have behaved differently and not been so manipulative and controlling in their children\u2019s' lives. Say what? Being lacking in a strong Christian faith is not synonymous with lacking compassion and empathy!2.It takes two decades to reunite this couple who have remained deeply in love. Their daughter has grown up without her parents. The events set in motion twenty years ago have caused irreparable damage. My issue \u2026 the author wants us to believe that after all that has transpired these seven characters will reunite and fall into each other\u2019s arms full of forgiveness because they now have God in their lives. Really? You would think that there might be at least one of them that is holding onto a bit of anger and perhaps would like to lash out and express their grief about the years that have virtually been stolen from them? Apparently not.The story had potential to be very good but it just was not realistic to me. The reunion was too easy; the author wrapped it up in a nice little package and stuck a bow on it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like happy endings and I am not saying that this couldn\u2019t end happily. I am just saying I don\u2019t think that the forgiveness could have come so easily without a little conflict and venting of anger first."}, {"userName": "Sam", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7435812-sam", "userReview": "It wasn't outstandingly beautiful prose, or a praise-worthy plot line, but this book made me cry. And for that, I give it 5 stars. There have been around, maybe 6, 7, books in my life that have had me sobbing (it's not easy to get my tears going in books) and this one had me wailing into the book in the middle of the night. Even Now had me smiling and laughing and making some sort of sound in my throat that sounded like sobbing and choking all at once... When Lauren and Shane were finally reunited, I felt like throwing myself to the ground in relief, tears streaming down my cheeks. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a touching book. Once in a while, perhaps because my tears come hard when I read, I appreciate reading a book so beautifully written that it sends my emotions on a rollercoaster. This book is definitely one of those books. If you don't mind shedding a tear or clutching fearfully at your chest for the sake of the characters, this book is definitely for you."}, {"userName": "Ky", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1939145-ky", "userReview": "I feel like I'm really going against the grain here by saying this book was OK since Karen Kingsbury is such a famous author. However, I just wasn't caught up in this book. It was very \"average\" for me. In my opinion, the characters were forgettable and the development was slow. There were elements of the story that were somewhat implausible - I found myself thinking \"why on earth would she do that?\" or \"how could she not know that\" a couple of times. There were definitely some stretches. I just didn't really feel it and wouldn't read it again."}, {"userName": "Trey Atkins", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3806658-trey-atkins", "userReview": "I read this because Kingsbury's books encourage my wife. The theme of God's control of our lives and situations is one I am fully behind, but this now ranks as my least favorite book. Mainly due to disappointment.When I read self-published work, mistakes are common and expected. However, this is a well-known author with a respected publisher, yet the mistakes in storyline and editing seem to indicate both are interested far more in the profit to be had and than in a quality story and book.A few examples:1. I am not an editor and read fast, yet, was distracted by dozens of simple editing mistakes. They are embarrassing to list and would result in a \"F\" at a high school or college.2. The storyline is not realistic. The reaction to the loss of a baby, the story of how they remain apart and unable to contact one another, and the actions of the parents to keep them apart begin the list of plot and storyline that simply could not happen. 3. The storyline has conflicting facts. Ages and dates have conflicts. The timing of high school, college and military training makes it impossible for Shane to have served in the Gulf War. At most points in the story Shane is said to be a baseball player, except when it is football. This list could go on, but I'm only growing more disappointed in the lack of professionalism.I appreciate the Christian teaching about prayer, trusting God, and God's control over events. However, I've never wanted a refund on a book before, but feel disappointed enough in this one to consider asking."}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1101211-tammy", "userReview": "It is a good thing that this is not the first Kingsbury book that I have read, because if it had been, I would not have read another and that would have been a loss. The constant emotional pain that the characters in \"Even Now\" endure (most of it brought on by themselves) for a solid eighteen years and 333 pages left me wrung out and exhausted. Even when the happy ending came, I couldn't feel the joy.  The experiences shared by the seven main characters were told and retold endlessly through each of their different perpectives. I felt like I was being beaten to death with the plot and could have rehearsed it in my sleep. Too much drama, too much anguish, too much unrelenting, heart-wrenching pain and regret for all of us. The beautiful thing about time is that it heals and softens our losses and sorrows, even if not able to completely erase them. It was unrealistic that the pain of these characters (especially Lauren's) never dulled. The story felt contrived and forced. Too many bad things happened for it to be believable. That being said, Karen Kingsbury has written some beautiful novels. I have been touched, uplifted and motivated by her books. Just not this one. It is wonderful to read the words of someone who includes the reality of God in her works, and is not afraid to let sacred things remain sacred i.e., she doesn't fill her books with sensuality and lust."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12211077-julie", "userReview": "I've read about 75% of Karen Kingsbury's books and this was by far my least favorite. I would have given it 1 star if it hadn't been for the lessons on forgiveness. My first issue with this book is the fact that Shane and Lauren had no idea where the other was moving to. Seriously?! They didn't even exchange addresses or at least the name of the town? I thought that was absurd. My second issue was with Lauren running away after she thought Emily died. She didn't think she should stick around for a proper burial or memorial service? My third issue was that there was no contact between Emily and Shane's parents, other than saying goodbye at the airport. Shouldn't there have been a scene where they ask Emily for forgiveness and try to get to know their granddaughter? I don't know how Shane and Lauren ended up with such great careers because they both were quite stupid in the other aspects of their lives.

I did get a little frustrated with characters who seem to have no common sense at all. Parts of the story were unbelievable to me. It was a quick read, and a page turner.

This is the second Karen Kingsbury I have read and I have to say: the woman had talent! The first Kingsbury I picked up was, \"A Thousand Tomorrows\" and it was a complete and total gut-wrenching, tear jerker.

The book is centered around one main event, but you follow several different characters that were involved. So your getting to see how everyone in the story was affected.Where to begin....Our story starts out with a young girl, looking through a box of personal belongings that belonged to her mother. A mother she has never known, but desperately desires to meet.Flashback to the 80's. Lauren Anderson and Shane Galanter are two 17yr olds who are deeply in love and have been since they were 13. Shane is a star baseball player and Lauren, a natural born writer and story teller. Both being popular and coming from wealthy and prestigious families, it seems they have the world in the palms of their hands. The only thing stopping them from having the bright future they had always planned, is that they have just discovered that Lauren is pregnant.The young couple want nothing more than to be together and raise their child. They had already planned to be together forever anyways, forever is just going to start a little earlier than they had anticipated. However, both sets of parents have different plans... After continuous urging to give up their child for adoption, Lauren and Shane remain adamant that they want to keep and raise their baby together. So the parents plans to keep the children apart conspires, in hopes Lauren will chose to give up the baby and that Shane will simply lose interest and move on. Both families move to different states without giving the teens anyway to contact eachother. (Keep in mind, this is the 80's. No internet. No cellphones.)Lauren eventually gives birth to a healthy baby girl, and decides she now must find Shane. She, along with her now, 4wk old daughter hit the freeway, the only clue she has as to Shane's whereabouts is that his family is now living somewhere in Southern California. Along the way trouble intervenes, the newborn becomes sick. With no money and no insurance and positive her family had filed her as a missing persons report, she has no choice but to return home for help.After getting her baby to the hospital, Lauren learns that her baby has pneumonia and has little to no chance of making it. She prays for a miracle. Things begin to take a turn for the better, but when a mistake leads to the giving of false information, Lauren runs and never looks back...Til 18yrs later when she receives an email that will forever change her life and show her what she's been missing while she's been running from her past. Lauren always thought she would have time to reconcile with her parents, that when she eventually found Shane she would return home and show them that they could never truly keep them apart. Time is no longer on her side and the race is on to make it home in time. But the surprise that awaits for her upon her arrival is far beyond anything she could ever phathom...Now with the chance to have the family she always dreamed of, will she be able look past her broken heart and find the peace it takes to move on or will she do what she's always done...and run.\"She blinked, and the memory swirled into nothingness, like dust in the desert wind. It didn't matter what would happen, because she couldn't go back. She didn't know the way if she wanted to.\"I think it's safe to say I really enjoyed this book. I usually won't review one I didn't like. Kingsbury is a terrific author. Her way with words and ability to draw you in is impeccable.I went into this book without any knowledge of what the book was going to be about, for the copy I own didn't have a description. So I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. After reading, I discovered this book was part one in a two part series. While the ends in this book were, for the most part, tied up rather nicely and you could easily read as a standalone, I would very much like to see what became of our characters.\"So this was her life now. Lies and making due and pretending she was someone she wasn't. The pain she carried buried deep within her. She blinked tears away.So be it.\"Without a doubt my favorite character of this story would have to be Lauren. I felt such a strong connection with her. I could feel her joy and fears as she was about to become a mother. My heart broke and I cried with her when Shane was forced to leave. When she finally felt peace, I breathed a sigh of relief. Her heart and mine became one throughout the course of this story.The parents in this story.... oh my word. I never in my life wanted to jump into the pages of a book and shake a character so badly. (And I read the Fallen series!!) Thier behavior towards their children, was completely unacceptable and uncalled for. Both teens had admitted to making a mistake and fully wanted to take responsibility for their actions. 1). Because of how much they cared for echother. 2). Because they both had a strong faith in God and looked to Him as their source of strength. However, neither set of parents was interested in anything other than keeping up appearances. As a parent to two girls, this book showed me how not to react if, God-forbid something like this happened to them. I'm thankful that they were able to see the error in their transgressions and able to turn over new leaves and not make the same mistakes later on.\"Everyone thinks we're too young to know what love is. But I look at the way you and daddy and the Galanters are, the way your friendship has died because of this, and you know what I think?.. Being old hasn't helped you know what love is either.\"I loved Shane as the male lead. He was a believer and never lost his faith even though his world was crumbling all around him. In his heart he wanted nothing more than to be with Lauren, even after 18yrs. His character was genuine and fit the story nicely.I highly recommend this book. It is a Christian fiction and while it does deal with some mature themes, it is clean and written in a manor that encourages purity and the importance of forgivness. In my opinion it would be appropriate for a teen or older."}], "description": "Sometimes hope for the future is found in the ashes of yesterday.Shane Galanter is a man ready to put down roots after years of searching.
