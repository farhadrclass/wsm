I could spend this entire review singing praises to Victoria Scott who I believe that anything she write is just magic. Or I could fill the entire review with quotes. I was highlighting before I even hit chapter one. The words are all so beautiful I just couldn\u2019t stop myself. But instead, I will try my best to convince you how fantastic this book was, that the whole series was. And hope that I will convince at least someone to give this series a try. We left book two with things a mess. Aspen is in hell. The bad guys want Charlie. And, they want war. Dante, Charlie, Kraven, and all their friends are at the hive. They are training in preparation for the war. Charlie is the savior and must be protected. And, Aspen is the soldier and must be rescued. Dante is still Dante. He is full of himself, full of snark, attitude, anger, and self doubt. But, above everything else, he loves Charlie Cooper. From the first, his love for her moved me. I don\u2019t think I ever have read a book where the love was so deep, so devoted. \n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m sharp eyes for watching her, and broad shoulders for easing her worries, and strong hands for holding her tight.\u201d\nBut Dante constantly doubts his worth. He doesn\u2019t think he is worthy of Charlie, or worthy of the new liberator cuff he now wears. He knows his love for Charlie is true. But he is having troubles having faith in anyone else but himself. Dante is probably the most heartbreaking character I have ever read about. As we have gotten to know him throughout this series, we come to understand why he loathes himself the way he does. But in this book, we see him slowly allow others in. He has friendships with other guys. He feels love and protectiveness for Annabelle.\n\u201cI dare to imagine that after this war is over, that I\u2019ll have a group of friends that care about me, and that I in turn care for. What kind of life would that be? To be a part of a family that nurtures one another?\u201d\nEvil is lurking, though, right outside the walls of the hive. The sirens are out there waiting. And their evil leader, Rector, is busy plotting the capture of Charlie. There is a traitor amongst them. Someone is helping them to get into the hive. Dante has some pretty strong feelings on who he thinks it could be but he\u2019s not sure. This book has a love story like no other. But it also is a classic tale of good vs. evil. And of one person that believes in the good in people above all else. Charlie is that person. This book had heart stopping battles that had my heart beating out of my chest. It made me laugh out loud with Dante\u2019s attitude. And, it broke my heart. In any war, there are sacrifices. Who in this group of fighters, will sacrifice themselves. \n\u201cFor all my talk of being amazing, down deep, in a place I never venture, I know the truth. I am despicable. I wasn\u2019t a good human. So why would Big Guy ever want me as a liberator after this war is over? The answer: he won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIf you want to laugh, cry, shout, pump your fist in the air, clutch your chair, this series is for you. Dante Walker will forever be in my heart. Thank you, Victoria Scott, for a wonderfully entertaining and heartwarming series."}, {"userName": "Nasty Lady MJ", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4026143-nasty-lady-mj", "userReview": "To see full letter click on one of the following links:My blogBooklikesDear Dante,Yes, I\u2019m doing it through a Dear John letter. Despite the fact you apparently have swag.You don\u2019t though.Your so called charm is annoying and shows a lack in character development.I could maybe understand it for the first book and a half, but grow up dude.There\u2019s a reason why you are and always will be a screw up. Well, maybe you\u2019ll grow up in the last forty-nine percent of the last installment in your series. But you disgusted me to the point where I couldn\u2019t continue. Plus, the rest of your book didn\u2019t do much for me either.Here\u2019s why we won\u2019t work. I\u2019m a lady who has self respect, unlike Charlie. I find you behavior eye roll worthy and immature. I mean, considering you caused two girls to lose their souls for the time being I think you could grow up a little. But you still remain the same immature douche you were in book one.Okay, I\u2019ll rephrase that. You grew a little bit at the end of book one that greatly reduced how much I viewed you as a selfish bastard in the first book. However, all that character growth is gone. You are back to the same selfish bastard you were before.Seriously, all you do is whine about how Charlie won\u2019t let you get laid because of Aspen.Who has to be one of the most pointless characters ever.I hate love triangles. And in a way I should be glad you didn\u2019t have romantic feelings Aspen. But I really have to wonder why the freakity freak is she in this series? She\u2019s serves absolutely no purpose other than to couple up one of the remaining singles and to fulfill a part of a stupid prophecy that makes Charlie super sparkly special.You know, if you want to fall in love with the normal girl. She should really be normal.I\u2019m just saying.And what do you see in Charlie, Dante. I get that you call her your girl. You only say that every other sentence. When your not describing how sick her body is. Which is a body you magicked her into having-by having her get rid of her soul.Don\u2019t you think there\u2019s something a little wrong there? Of course you say you miss the way old Charlie looked, but I remember how he made fun of her appearance for a good chunk of the first book.Any woman with self respect remembers these things. Obviously, Charlie doesn\u2019t have any self respect. And that\u2019s probably why you two work."}, {"userName": "Faye, la Patata", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7650833-faye-la-patata", "userReview": "No doubt the very reason I looked forward to\u00a0this series so much was because of Dante Walker. He's a very interesting person, someone I'd love to read in a book, but would love to hate in real life because he reeks of swag (oh, how I hate the word), tactlessness, and arrogance. I say that, but I truly love him, especially since he's written convincingly well. There are heroes who are written to be like this, but they don't really show it. And there are heroes written like Dante who talks the talk, and walks the walk effortlessly. It's amazing, Victoria Scott's talent, of making a character super into his character, that everything he does and everything he says, akes perfect sense because that's what someone his character would do and say. His internal narration here is definitely the \"life of the party\" if that makes sense. He's brimming and overflowing with personality, spunk, and swag, that you'll definitely miss it when this tale comes to an inevitable end.But after turning the last page, I was surprised to actually feel a lot of disappointment.No, Dante is not the reason (although there are times I wanna whack him on the head). The twists and turns, I felt, were pretty good, too. There's this epic battle between heaven and hell that spans chapters, and you just want to read more of it because they feel so raw and exciting. When the traitor was revealed, I couldn't believe my eyes at first, and was kind of in denial for a while.But there were a lot of flaws, flaws that made this the weakest book in the trilogy for me (the first one being the best). I'll list them here:* What happened to Charlie? I loved her in Book 1 but in the last two books she suddenly felt like a secondary character. Her bubbly personality pretty much vanished in thin air and she became this hollow, boring shell of what she used to be. All she did:\u00a0comfort Dante every few pages, be oggled by Dante, be touched by Dante, make out with Dante, say hollow words over and over and over again, simply smile, etc.... it's come to the point that I didn't look forward to her scenes anymore.* When it came\u00a0to Charlie, Dante transforms into this love sick puppy. It was so exhausting especially in the first part of the book where he kept fantasizing about Charlie - her boobs (specifically, her \"rack\"), her legs, her perfect body, and how he kept\u00a0getting wood because of them. It was fun at first, but it got old quickly. And his bacon monologues got boring after a while, too.* The plot sometimes felt too suffocating. Dante was doing so many things at once that it didn't feel focused - like it was all over the place. Sure, it was multi-tasking, but man, it sure was busier than me on my busiest day. There's protecting Charlie, saving Aspen, finding out the traitor, translating the frigging scroll, having to decipher whether he can be a good guy or not, having to be the peacemaker in the love affairs of his buddies, etc. etc. It was like even I couldn't catch a breath.* Annabelle was a kick-ass character, but her role here felt forced.\u00a0She has really no other role than be Dante's Charlie to Kraven. Does everybody really need a love interest? Dante has Charlie, Blue has Aspen, Max has Valery, so we have to have someone for Kraven, too? Come on, now...* There were times the romance aspect was overpowering. This is romance-heavy, just a bit of warning out there.Overall, though, I'd recommend this book if you love strong-willed characters who have a lot of personality like Dante. It ended in a strong note, with a bit of a cheesy ending, but awesome all the same. There were\u00a0just a bit of details here and there I could've lived without, so take heed of them if you have little patience."}, {"userName": "Alex B.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18245495-alex-b", "userReview": "FREAKING DANTE, MY BABYE CHARLIE AND MY BABY ASPEN.

I fell in love with the amazing Dante Walker series when I devoured the first installment in the series, The Collector. Since then I have been dying to see how the series would end... and let me tell you it is not a disappointment.Dante Walker has been through hell. He has gone from A Collector, someone working for hte devil, to A Liberator, someone working for God. Now he has a huge challenge ahead of him. Complete his training to be A Liberator, save Aspen from hell and save Charlie. But nothing is as easy as it seems and it is uncertain who will survive the final battle.I have to admit that as much as I couldn't wait for this book I was a little nervous. I've recently read Victoria Scott's other series Fire & Flood and didn't really like it that much and so I was a little bit nervous that those feelings would pass into The Warrior. I needn't have worried. The Warrior was amazing and Victoria Scott's writing has really proved to be amazing. No matter what she is such a fantastic author and her writing is completely addictive.Once again, I fell head over heels in love with Dante Walker. He is just the most amazing character and the more I read the more I loved him. He is cheeky and sarcastic. Protective and romantic. He is just pure perfectness wrapped up in a super hotness.The Warrior was utter perfection. I was a little bit afraid of the ending after I've read some not-so-amazing endings of trilogies but Victoria knows how to end a series well. The ending was perfect and she really stayed true to her fans and gave us the kind of ending we wanted. I loved it so much and my faith has been restored in trilogy endings.The Dante Walker Series is a must read for everyone. It seriously has everything that you could ever want in a book. Romance, action, snark. It was pure awesomeness. I am really going to miss this series but it is one that I will read over and over again."}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4148118-valerie", "userReview": "5 stars - A masterful puzzle woven from trust and love!First Impressions...I have loved this series from the start. Every book has been 5 stars. Dante is fun, powerful and insightful. I was totally excited for the end.The Characters...Not sure if anyone would be surprised by this but Dante is my favorite in this book and this series. His strength and self-importance is endearing and so funny but what really draws me to him is his doubt. His love for Charlie brings him from a collector to a liberator but he's never been convinced that he's good enough. He goes through the motions but be doesn't believe in his worth. But there is a masterful plan to teach him and he goes kicking and screaming. I see so much of myself in him. I just adore him for his weakness.Charlie has always been sweet. She is not the focus except as Dante loves her. I care for her and she did stress me during this book but she is not my passion. Other characters endured themselves to me but again were not the focus. This is Dante Walker's show and he definitely stole the stage.The Story...I am always amazed at Victoria Scott's magic. She weaves a puzzle and has you thinking but always holds back just enough that you're never sure until the characters are. Hidden between her living, breathing characters the clues are there and clear, should be all seeing.Fun and addictive, this story had me laughing and crying. I was captivated as Dante figures things out about himself and then about how to fix the problem at hand. The themes are strong of forgiveness, self acceptance and love, all wrapped up in a very enjoyable journey.Did I Put It Down...Nope.In The End...If you enjoy the YA scene, if you enjoy paranormal, or if you just love a great story with some meaning behind it, then you need this book, this series.

So much happened in the last book and so much was still left undone and like all last books, we always hope for the best.If there is one thing you could say about this series is that is is highly entertaining, Dante, is highly entertaining. He is amusing, and vocal and you never know what will come out of his mouth (or in his thoughts) next. He always has a come back or a witty remark right there waiting to come out and stun you and I love that about him. It is what makes him, him. It is what truly makes this series.And while Dante was Dante, this one moved a little slow for me. I struggled through it a little more than the first two. Dante was still great but, maybe he lost something after book two?I don't want to put any spoilers in here for any of the books but Dante losing who is lost, messed with him and not in a good way like Charlie does.Dante struggles a lot in this book with his new role as a liberator, protecting Charlie, uncovering the writing in the scrolls, rescuing a certain someone in Hell, and most of all, with himself. Believe it or not, the boy has some issues and insecurities and they run deep. And while I struggled with the chaotic mess this could be at times with so much going on, I really liked it too. It held pretty true to the other books in the trilogy with a few exceptions and the ending was surprisingly fitting.

Whether you like this book or not will depend on how you feel about Dante. I, for one, can\u2019t get enough of him. He\u2019s cocky, sarcastic, blunt, and sometimes insensitive, yet so hilarious and entertaining. He says things like, \u201cPow!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve got swag for days\u201d and talks about how \u201cgangsta\u201d he is and maybe but maybe not oblivious to the fact that if he met another him he\u2019d probably hate him and make fun of him. It\u2019s great. I don\u2019t know what made Scott tap into this guy\u2019s mind, or how, but she does a brilliant job. The stuff she comes up with\u2026 Dante is definitely one of a kind, and I\u2019ll miss his unfiltered personality more than a little bit. If, like me, he makes you laugh, or grin ridiculously, or even roll your eyes but in a \u201cI can\u2019t believe he just said that and I\u2019m trying hard not to crack\u201d way, then it\u2019s a series worth investing your time in. The Warrior picks up right where The Liberator ended and, without spoiling anything, there\u2019s romance, betrayals, an epic battle, and some lighthearted moments mixed in. If you haven\u2019t yet read the first two books in this series, Dante is a Collector, someone who has died and works for Lucifer \u201ccollecting\u201d other people\u2019s souls for hell. When someone sins, a Collector can imprint their soul with a seal. Dante\u2019s assignment in the first book is Charlie, an unattractive, quirky girl with a big heart, who is destined to do great things. As Dante comes to see her goodness and how much she helps others and tries to see them for who they really are, love begins to transform him. Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s still the same devilish guy, his loyalties have just changed. In The Warrior especially he\u2019s willing to do whatever it takes to keep Charlie safe. There is a war brewing between heaven and hell, and it\u2019s up to Dante, Charlie, their friends, and other Liberators (those who work for the Big Guy against the Collectors) to bring peace to the world.I was really excited to see how Victoria Scott would tie everything together, especially considering the heavy emphasis on faith. I like how she weaves in the spiritual overtones, focusing more on personal strength and the soul rather than any one belief system. Christianity may be the foundation, but this is a fantasy series, and she deviates enough that it never becomes preachy. There were a few things I didn\u2019t see coming, and a few that I did, and by the end I felt satisfied. I enjoyed trying to piece together the various prophecies alongside the characters, and there are some surprises when they finally come to light. Dante\u2019s spiritual journey is the most important of all, though. The way his perception - of himself, of others, and even of God - changes over the course of the series is gradual. He\u2019ll still make a quip about someone\u2019s appearance or what they\u2019re wearing, but they become less and less factors on how he judges them. Dante was not the nicest kid before dying, but the shallowness he keeps wrapped around himself like a blanket due to his parent\u2019s neglect and his own selfishness slowly falls off. He\u2019s still the same Dante, but different in the ways that matter. As far as the action goes, I will say that not much happens during the first half of The Warrior. When I wasn\u2019t laughing, which admittedly wasn\u2019t that much of the time, I felt like the pacing was slow and meandering, and I was waiting for the plot to pick up. It\u2019s only toward the end when the stakes are finally raised. This is also a romance-heavy series, and it does overtake the plot sometimes, but I\u2019m a romance junkie, so I won\u2019t really complain. There\u2019s no love triangle, thank God, and Dante\u2019s dedication to Charlie is sweet, if also amusing since he\u2019ll freely admit he\u2019s whipped even though he can\u2019t quite believe it himself. Charlie, unfortunately, has gotten less interesting over the course of the series. The weird girl who liked jumping on beds and eating skittles fades into the background, delegated to more of a girlfriend role, and she\u2019s dull in the face of Dante\u2019s bold personality. I know why he fell in love with her; I just wish she stayed more offbeat. Even the transformation she makes at the end of The Warrior, her sudden kickass, aloof attitude, feels clich\u00e9 and unauthentic. Overall, it\u2019s a fun, entertaining series that lives and dies by its narrator. Dante Walker himself is the reason for the stars and why I would recommend reading the books. Unless he\u2019s not your cup of tea, which I know has been the case for some readers. Thankfully I\u2019ve enjoyed everything Victoria Scott has written, and I can\u2019t wait to see what characters she gifts us with next. They may never compare to Dante, but I\u2019m willing to let her try. ;)This review can also be found at Love at First Page."}, {"userName": "Brittany", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1033303-brittany", "userReview": "Find the original review  here So we've come to the end. I've had to say good-bye to Dante. I'm going to miss his inappropriate comments and swag. But alas, I know that it won't be the end. I will re-visit this series again and again down the road. At least to go back to my favourite one liners. Dante never failed to make to me laugh with such classic lines as; \"Back the hell up, Kraven,\" I say. \"Take you hand off her. I get that your trouser snake is angsty, but keep your temper in check.\" \"You're attracted to me, I know. Everyone is. Don't start second guessing your sexuality. It's just a Dante Walker thing.\"Dante and gang are gearing up for an epic battle between heaven and hell. So Kraven has the Liberators training their asses off. But the Collectors and Sirens are not making it easy. They're attacking the Hive any chance they get. It's obvious they're trying to weaken the Liberators as much as possible before the day of Reckoning is upon them.Kraven has brought in an old professor named Oswald to help decipher the rest of the scroll. If he can figure out what is written there than the Liberators are sure to have the upper hand in the battle.There's still the problem that Aspen, the solider, is stuck in hell. Dante dreams about her every night. Well they're more like nightmares. But he just knows Aspen is trying to tell him something. He's just got to figure it out.Charlie, the savior, is by Dante's side in the Hive. But she's anything but safe. The Collectors are after her. And with all the break ins and close encounters it's pretty clear there's a traitor among the Liberators. But who is it? Dante is pretty sure he knows. And he's not shy about letting everyone know(when is Dante ever shy about anything?). He's going to protect Charlie with all that he can because there is no way he can lose her. Dante is still Dante to the core. But he's done a lot of growing since we met him in The Collector. He's still full of swag and is not lacking in the confidence department. He still throws out inappropriate comments and innuendos at every turn. But with Charlie is his life and Aspen stuck in hell he's come to realize there's more important things than clothes, cars and parties. Dare I say he's calmed down a little too. There's still times when he's easy to fly off the handle. But he's got friends and a girlfriend who care and are there to stand by his side or bring him back down to earth. He's still struggling with his Liberator status. He doesn't trust the Big Guy yet. Kraven and Charlie keep telling him he needs to have faith. And faith is something Dante struggles with through most of the The Warrior.Dante is such a softy when it comes to Charlie. I think their relationship is as strong as ever in The Warrior. Life is just getting the way. Aspen's fate lays heavily on both of their shoulders. As well as what they gathered from the scroll. What it foretells is not looking good for their future together. But they will fight together until the end. Charlie is just so good and pure. She really is going to save the world from itself. She sees the good in everyone. And as the story goes on she just becomes even more kick-ass. Dante wants to protect her from everything, but it's obvious she doesn't need it. She can protect herself. She's got a destiny to fulfill and she's not shying away from it. Charlie knows what she needs to do to save the ones she loves. I love that Scott gave us complete story arc's for all our favourite side characters too. Max, Valery, Blue, Annabelle and Kraven all had lives that I become invested in too. They are all fully developed characters and I needed to know what was going to happen to them in the end. Scott didn't forget about them. They were there throughout the books and all were given endings to their stories too.The Warrior promises a lot of things. And I'd say it delivered. We get the big battle between heaven and hell. There's bloodshed, death, the return of unexpected friends and even the unexpected traitors are revealed. Of course we get to experience this through Dante's snarky and witty voice. It's the one thing that really made me fall in love with this series. Scott's writing is very unique and unforgettable. There is no way I will ever forget about Dante. He will be ingrained in my heart forever. He knows how to make me laugh even when something sad has just happened. Or something has just made me angry. Dante has it covered with a pick me up.I'm left feeling very satisfied with The Warrior. Of course I'd love to see more of Dante and crew in the future. But like I said before, these books will definitely be ones I re-read down the road. One more Dante quote for the road, yea?\"Look, cat, you and I are never going to be friends. She's going to call you Max, but I'm going to call you Shit Head. And if you think for one second-\" The cat lies down in a tight little ball of nastiness and falls asleep. \"Oh, please. Make yourself at home by sleeping on my scrotum.\"Pow!Brittany"}, {"userName": "Jacklyn (ReadingBliss)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51158438-jacklyn-readingbliss", "userReview": "3.9 Stars I don\u2019t want to go on too long because I feel like this person already did a fine job at describing the minute details of where it went wrong and where it went right.

What makes this series though, is Dante\u2019s particular swag. I laughed out loud practically any time he was talking. The things he\u2019d say are crude and offensive, but his taboo attitude is what make him hilarious. I would\u2019ve loved this book, and the whole series, so much more if every book didn\u2019t have the same flaw: half of it\u2019s entertainment was missing. I know she tried, but I was pretty bored in one half of each book. This time, I felt as if the plot didn\u2019t move for aprox. 100 pages! It kept building up until the second half arrived, jammed pack with excitement. Granted, all the excitement saved it\u2019s rating (and me), but so much happened that I had to ignore the little voice in my head that said it might not be realistic.

He\u2019s still upset about what happened in hell and he doesn\u2019t believe he deserves to shake his guilt away. When enemies start showing up at places that are supposed to be safe and secure, Dante begins to wonder if someone has switched to the bad side. Can he find and kill the traitor before all hell breaks loose?Even though Dante\u2019s emotions are at war, he is still haughty, funny and at times, downright hilarious when he\u2019s among people. But when he\u2019s alone, his inner dialogue is a bit on the disconcerting side. I have to say, I\u2019m not a fan of his dark, churning thoughts. I get that he has a lot on his mind but when he repeatedly thinks the same thing, it\u2019s kinda boring. But if you ask me whether I prefer Dante as a collector or a liberator, my answer is definitely\u2026 LIBERATOR. Despite his assumption that he\u2019s not cut out for good, Dante is GOOD. And working for the Big Guy suits him. He has an instinct to want to protect everyone from harm and when he does his thing to dissolve sin seals right before the big battle, my tears spill.With a traitor among the liberators, I feel eager to wear my detective cap, hoping to figure out who this person is before it\u2019s revealed in the book. Some of the clues are quite misleading but in the end, the revelation makes me feel a bit surprised, shocked and disappointed. There are things I haven\u2019t seen coming and so I feel pleasantly surprised, but there are also things I find too obvious, making the revelation less interesting in my opinion.But other than that, I have a very enjoyable time reading the story. New characters are introduced and I like that they help to bring out something in Dante that surprises him, and also me. It\u2019s sweet to see him and Charlie together \u2013 I like that Dante\u2019s love for Charlie is immeasurable and that he doesn\u2019t shy away from expressing his love, even when there are people around. I also like that we get to know more about other characters like Kraven and Annabelle in this story. I wouldn\u2019t have thought I\u2019d find Kraven charming but he does astound me with some of his action and behavior here. Annabelle is strong and fearless and I like that she doesn\u2019t back off from hardship even when she has other seemingly easier options to choose. The girl power theme is still very strong in this installment and I love that we get to see Charlie in action \u2013 she is such a force to be reckoned with \u2013 and I can see why Boss Man finds her a threat right from the very beginning.The ending battle is hugely entertaining and I really like a lot of the things achieved by Dante, Charlie and their friends.Overall, I\u2019d say The Warrior is an enjoyable conclusion to the trilogy.Note: I seldom find cocky characters appealing but Dante, surprisingly, manages to win me over and capture my heart.--Originally posted on LeisureReads.comA copy of the book was provided by book blog tour organizer for review purposes."}, {"userName": "Jessica (Step Into Fiction)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4986812-jessica-step-into-fiction", "userReview": "Review originally posted at Step Into FictionActual rating: 4.5 starsIf you have NOT read The Collector & The Liberator, please read with caution. There are some spoilers that were unavoidable. Proceed with caution . . . This book is, in my opinion, the strongest of the three. It had the humor I've grown to love from Dante (his voice is just so different from anything I typically read), it had the tears, it had the heartbreak and the loss but it also had an ending that you could smile, even after everything you lost. To me, that is what makes a fantastic book and especially a fantastic ending. When you can tie everything together, break a piece of our hearts (or who knows, even shatter them in to a million pieces) but have us walking away with a feeling of satisfaction. With a feeling of relief. Victoria Scott nailed it. Pow!I have never had a book where I was on the verge of crying, like literally they were moment away from rolling down my cheek and then all the sudden, the next scene makes them go away. I never shed a tear but let me tell you, there were too many scenes to count where they were right there, building, ready to let themselves loose just awaiting that final push. That push never came because it was always followed with something that made me smile or made me laugh or just made me feel so damn proud to know these characters.There is so much that happens in this book that I wasn't even sure how it was going to all work out. Especially when the battle that we've all been waiting for was happening somewhere around the 70% mark. I knew there was way too much of the book left for this to be it and it was far from over. I don't think there was a character in this book that I didn't like, not including the workers from Hell, of course (Max excluded). I think that was my fear going in to this book, that I felt so attached to everyone that I knew it was going to pain me when I lost some of them. But then not knowing who might go, had me biting my nails anytime things got rough.Not to mention there is a person in their mix that is betraying them and working for the other side. I'm proud to say I figured it out but it still didn't make the sting of this person's betrayal hurt any less.If you haven't read this series, pick it up because it's just such a fun read. If you don't laugh out loud, you'll be laughing internally. If you've read this series but haven't finished it with this book, don't wait. It's totally worth the read and you'll be closing the book with a smile on your face.Thank you so much to Entangled for allowing me the chance to read this book in exchange for an honest review.

Brimming with plenty of Dante Walker mouthiness, swoon worthy scenes, and an epic battle, this is a series ender that rocked. Victoria Scott pulled out all the stops in this book. With shocking secrets, betrayals, character deaths, and plenty of surprises, The Warrior wraps up Dante's story perfectly, and in the most fitting way possible. Dante Walker rocked in this book. He's still the same old egotistical, say it how it is, fiercely protective, loyal character fans have come to love. As the series draws to an end with The Warrior, we see just how much Dante has grown as a character through out the entire series. Don't worry, Dante still banters, and says things that make me laugh, but there's a maturity to him now that I don't think was as dominant in the previous two books, as it was in this one. Through all that happens in this book, Dante does a lot of self reflection, and comes to terms with the choices he's made, and where he's at now. I like that he owned up to how he used to be, compared to the guy he is now. I couldn't help but love that vulnerability he has.

It is one of my favorite YA paranormal favorites, and I highly recommend it for males and females alike! Tis series has had everything that makes a great series! We've been given unforgettable and unique characters, a plot that completely hooks you, and keeps your interest, with a variety of surprises, humor, romance, friendship, and fantasy!The Warrior continues where The Liberator last left off. Heaven and Hell are preparing to go to war. There are sacred scrolls that need to be deciphered that will lead to clues about what is to unfold. So far we know that Aspen and Charlie are instrumental in Heaven winning the war. Aspen is \"the soldier\" and Charlie is \"the saint,\" as referenced by the scrolls. Unfortunately, Aspen is stuck in hell. As The Liberators, and other allies to heaven begin to go through extensive training for the final showdown, traitors are discovered, secrets and surprises revealed, as and The Collectors and Sirens continue to find ways to infiltrate the hive. Dante is determined to protect Charlie, train hard, and help decipher the scroll. Everything ends up going topsy turvy in the climax of The Dante Walker Series! While I was able to predict a few things that happened, there were still plenty of surprises that blindsided me!I love Dante! He still has major swagger, arrogance, sarcasm, and everything that makes him an amazing character! Pow! When Date appears on the page, you can't help but hold on to every word, though, and action that takes place! To top it off, Dante went through some major character growth. He underwent a huge trail of faith. He didn't believe \"The Big Guy\" cared about him, and deep down Dante despised himself, and felt unworthy of redemption. We got to see a very human side to Dante in this final installment. He had to deal with his fear of losing Charlie, and anger. He became more \"human\" as he started to develop really deep friendships with others, and let himself care, and eventually trust in Kraven's plan.It was wonderful getting reunited with all of my favorite characters from this series. We get more Charlie, Annabelle, Kraven, Blue, Max, Valery (Red), and Lincoln. We also meet a few new characters. Oswald, was an old professor that was brought in to decipher the scrolls. Neco, Paine, and \"The Jack Rabbits,\" and many ordinary humans were brought in to the picture.I love paranormal stories with angels, and demons, heaven, and hell. This series is amazing, and I would recommend it to those of you that are fans of The Sweet Trilogy, by Wendy Higgins. My Rating:I give, The Warrior, by Victoria Scott, 5 POWerful, Exciting, Addicting, Swagger-Filled Dantelicious Stars! Read this series if you are a fan of YA Paranormal stories about angels and demons with a lot of laughter, romance, plot twists, and unforgettable characters!!!My Favorite Quotes:\"I spoke the words. Even now, I feel like I don't know half of what I'd like to know about Charlie. But maybe love is like that. Like two souls greet each other and say, it's you, and then they wait while the bodies and brains catch up. Maybe sometimes, that's all it takes.

And trust me when I say that Dante Walker is one bad boy that you will be falling head over heels in lust with.I am pretty sad that The Warrior is the final book in this series. I, for one, am going to miss Dante\u2019s cocky attitude, his conceited ways, and just everything that is Dante! He is a character that readers won\u2019t forget, that\u2019s for darn sure.In The Warrior, the liberators are getting ready for the ultimate battle against the collectors. If they lose, demons will walk the earth and life will be forever changed. Hell still has their claim on Aspen, the soldier in the prophecy, but the liberators/heaven has Charlie, the savior. Although Dante has his Charlie back, safe and sound, in his arms, he is still gung ho on rescuing the girl (Aspen) who has come to be like a sister to him, from the fiery pits of hell.But is it even possible? With Aspen visiting Dante regularly in his dreams, does this mean that their souls have connected somehow? Or does it mean the one thing that Dante is afraid has happened\u2026that Aspen is dead and it\u2019s all Dante\u2019s fault.With the final days of the most important battle of their lives, Dante needs to figure out who the traitor is that hides within the liberator\u2019s stronghold and find out what the words on the scroll mean so that they can figure out how to win this battle.Lines are crossed, trusts are broken, and faith is tested in this final installment in the Dante Walker series.Dante Walker is one of those characters that you just can\u2019t get enough of. He\u2019s also one of those characters that, even though it\u2019s been sometime between books, readers can easily fall back in love with just by his first words that come out of his mouth. I love his cocky bad boy attitude, even though he is not much bad boy anymore. He\u2019s more like a love sick puppy\u2026with great one liners and still sexy as all heck.If you\u2019re looking for action, The Warrior by Victoria Scott has it all. With the collectors and their sirens being a constant threat (they\u2019re hanging off the side of the cliff waiting after all), and with black holes popping up at any time inside the liberators compound (thanks to a frickin\u2019 traitor \u2013 gah!), Dante and the crew are constantly on their toes. And then the final battle\u2026 so many feels guys. Even before the battle! Ugh\u2026You know that final books have to go out with a bang. There will be multiple twists and turns and gasp worthy moments\u2026there will be lives lost (obviously!) and big revelations. That is what you will find in The Warrior. What I also did find was myself chuckling to myself throughout the book. Dante delivers some of his best lines in this final book. From the beginning straight through to the end, Dante doesn\u2019t miss a beat\u2026Victoria Scott has created an amazing series and some unforgettable cast of characters. I\u2019m sad to see it all wrap up, but all good things must come to an end. *single tear* Fans of bad boys, angels and demons, and prophecy reads will really enjoy the Dante Walker series by Victoria Scott\u2026"}, {"userName": "Jessirae", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4487236-jessirae", "userReview": "The Warrior by Victoria Scott was an exceptional end to a trilogy that introduced me to the one and only Dante Walker. In this epic finale, Scott doesn\u2019t hesitate to raise the stakes in every level and form. Again, she entertained me, captivated me, and had me on the edge of my seat for the most part. Like I said previously in my review for The Liberator, I appreciate Scott for keeping Dante true to his character. He really has come full circle, even more so in The Warrior. He was still self conscious about his Liberator role, but Dante was so determined to help with the impending war, to protect Charlie and save Aspen from hell. I really thought I saw an even more deeper side to Dante in this book. True to his form, he was still arrogant, but my favorite parts of him were his doubts, his fears, and the guilt he felt even for the enemy. Dante learns a lot about himself, he pushes himself to be stronger and better, and he opens himself up to friendship and opens his eyes to the Big Guy. Dante was not perfect as much as he wishes to be and he made plenty of mistakes, but he continued to redeem himself, he continued to keep on trying and he made sure that he was giving his all every single time. I loved how plenty of new characters showed up and helped shaped Dante in this last book. Granted not all of them were truly on the good side, I did like the good I saw in them. My favorite quirky new character had to be Oswald. He was fun and smart and his role in the book was awesome. And speaking of characters, although it pains me to see some that I grew to love meet their end, I was glad that Scott wasn't afraid to kill certain characters. It was upsetting and heart breaking, but she gave their deaths meaning. She never once cut corners or did it just to give the book dramatics. Those deaths were legitimate and was given a close. I was also surprised by the amount of betrayal in the book, how certain characters turned from the Liberator side. It\u2019s funny how love and war are tricky and dirty and desperate and Scott totally managed to rock my belief in those particular characters.The amount of action and fighting in The Warrior was immense compared to book one and two. The strategies, the killing, the battles, the weapons were all exciting and shocking and probably the best parts of the book. Scott gave me exactly what I was looking for when it came to wars and epic battles and she did not disappoint in that last showdown between Dante and Rector. She built up the anticipation, she gave the thrill, she put in the drama, and the harsh reality that many will fall. Overall, I really love The Warrior. It was a fine piece of work to end Dante\u2019s story. Scott was well rounded in this one and I\u2019m completely content with how everything wrapped up so nicely. There is only one Dante Walker and Victoria Scott made sure we would never forget that.

Thrilling, action-packed, emotional, sexy, and LOL funny, that\u2019s how!! I was so looking forward to this read, because this series gave us the gift of a hero who wasn\u2019t afraid to be cocky, naughty, and smoking hot, all the while keeping a sense of humor that makes you feel like old friends. Oh, and there\u2019s also the awesome angels and demons soul-stealing, all-out battle between Heaven and hell storyline that is just a blast to dive into!Dante is back to his old tricks in a way this time around, but he\u2019s also evolved a lot since we first met him. Sure, he\u2019s still completely cocky and has his random immature narratives that cracked me up, but Charlie has brought out the sensitive and caring guy deep down inside of him. Much to his dismay! He\u2019s in denial for a long time about his feelings, but he starts to embrace (literally) the \u2018new me\u2019 that he\u2019s dealing with and I loved how grateful he always was to Charlie for that. He LOVES his girl, has all kinds of yummy lust for her, and has his heart ripped out facing the enemy over her. It was beautiful, sexy, and captivating!There was a lot of prep work as the battle approached, and Dante and the other liberators had a slew of enemies they were going to be facing. As they trained and tried to decipher the scroll that would give lead them to victory, there was hardly ever a dull moment thanks to Rector and the sirens. When the long-awaited battle finally arrived, the path there had been a painful one for Dante and Kraven\u2019s mixed-up group of fighters. Leading up to the ultimate showdown there was a lot of loss and torment, and it honestly began to feel like a lost cause for a moment there. Dante never waivered, though, and he and Kraven both turned their fury into revenge for their friends and loved ones. It was intense, gruesome, and heart-wrenching, the perfect culmination to this unforgettable series. I\u2019m sad to see the Dante Walker series come to an end, but if it had to wrap up this was just how it should be done!Quotes:Then again, I\u2019ve pulled out all the stops tonight.

I don't know why I haven't read it earlier, but after seeing so much Dante love over the internet I had to give it a try. And the only thing I regret is not reading this series sooner.Since this is a third book and there might be some readers out there like me, that haven't read the series or are starting them, I'll keep my review spoiler-free. So I'll tell you pretty much what the synopsis tells you: The Warrior continues where The Liberator last left off. Aspen's stuck in hell, Charlie's fate is to save to world (no pressure there or anything) and a big badass and probably bloody war between heaven and hell is coming, but if you have met Dante before this part of the story might even appeal you more if it's from his point of view.The Warrior is the perfect finale for a series such as the Dante Walker. It has a promising and entertaining plot filled with an epic battle and lots of danger, and the author also includes romance and humor with an easiness that characterizes every single Dante Walker book. I highly think that the strong point of this series is Dante and once again we have the opportunity to see his arrogance, sarcasm and bad boy attitude that makes readers laugh so hard even in the strangest situations. In this book, I found myself waiting for those moments. However, that badass attitude is also filled with some insecurities: he simply feels unworthy of redemption. Even he shows some emotions! I think Dante Walker's the perfect character for every single YA female reader. And he proves himself in The Warrior that's worthy of everything!It's nice to read about the characters you have grown fond off during the series and even to meet new ones. Victoria Scott's writing style is all over the pages of The Warrior and it's definitely poured as a incredible and enjoyable humor even in the worst case scenarios as it is the \"epic battle\" I talked about before. Overall, The Warrior is the perfect finale for the series and definitely a must read book. With a memorable love story and definitely an epic battle between good and evil, the Dante Walker's series are now one of my favorite series and I can only tell you to give it a try!"}, {"userName": "Sara (sarabara081)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5391613-sara-sarabara081", "userReview": "You can find more of my reviews at Forever 17 Books.I can\u2019t believe the time has come for this series to end! Reading The Warrior was a bittersweet experience. I found myself not only excited to see how the war between Heaven and Hell would play out and what would become of all our beloved characters, but also sad to know it would be the end of Dante Walker\u2019s story.I will keep this brief since it is a finale book but I think fans of the two previous books will be pleased overall. Like a lot of finale books with a war brewing, I was worried the pacing would start out slow with all the action focused on the end. And in ways I think that can be said for this one as well but there were some really great moments sprinkled in during the wait that grabbed my attention. I think part of my problem is I get so anxious for what is to come. I must say, Victoria Scott managed to throw a couple surprises at me! There were things I saw coming, definitely, but a few things I didn\u2019t see that left me in shock and feeling all kinds of feels I can\u2019t get into much further without spoiling. I will admit, though, that I teared up a time or two but in the end I was pleased how everything wrapped up.Dante Walker has always been such an interesting character I have thoroughly enjoyed reading. His voice was like no other \u2013 full of so much arrogance but in a charming way. He made this series just so much fun to read, always putting a smile on my face and making me laugh. He changes so much in these books but you can count on him to never fail and throw his cocky attitude around. Even though things get a little heavy in this book, he continued to be who he was, as always.\nIf war is coming, I make it look damn good.\nCharlie showed so much growth as well and was a huge force to be reckoned with, though part of me missed that quirky girl we first met in The Collector. My love for Annabelle grew in this book as I found myself getting very invested in her own story happening, a little love triangle blossoming on the side. In fact, I even wanted more of it! Really, all of the secondary characters added a great flare to the overall ending. I was invested in them all, which made the war that much more stressful! I needed all of my favorites to be okay and well, that added a lot of excitement and nerves to my reading experience.If you haven\u2019t already started this series, I would absolutely recommend it if you are looking for a fun paranormal read.

The war between heaven and hell is starting. Dante is on the side of heaven for a change and has to continue training. All the while, he keeps having dreams about Aspen, his friend that he left in hell and his girlfriend keeps distancing herself. First all: I wasn't as much of a fangirl over this series. Really, a demon who falls for a girl isn't a new story, but this series has turned into so much more after that first book. This book was very dark and very fast-paced. My stupid synopsis doesn't do any justice. Lastly, there are so many things happening in this book and many of them very surprising! Dante is a very interesting character and he has a very unique voice. His way of thinking was annoying in the beginning of the series, as he is very arrogant and a jerk, but I've grown used to him. I loved the character growth that he has gone through! Sure, he's still arrogant, but he's an arrogant liberator now.As for romance, I did really like Dante and Charlie together. Charlie is such an awesome girl! But, really, I wasn't really caring about their relationship in this book. I want to know more about Kraven and Anabelle!

While I\u2019ll admit things started off rather slow in the beginning, I think it\u2019s just in the nature of these \u201cconclusion books\u201d and it did set up for the latter half nicely. Dante was, by far, the strongest aspect and highlight of this book, of the series rather, and his personality overshadows the rest of story, but in a good way. You gotta love a confident guy with swagger! The inevitable battle at the end was pretty well played out and full of minor things I didn\u2019t expect at all.Like I said, Dante steals the show, as always, with this last installment. He\u2019s still as cocky and playful as ever, but you also get to see a sweet and caring side of him. His love for Charlie is so sweet and genuine, I really ship them as a couple. While Charlie can be a bit aloof and weird at times, I really liked their scenes together. I have to say that I really liked Kraven and Annabelle\u2019s story arc as well. I didn\u2019t expect to and I really liked the direction that Scott went with them. Seeing it all play out was highly entertaining as well.Scott also surprised me with a whopper of a twist, that even though it\u2019s obvious to the story, I really didn\u2019t see coming. And I really liked that about the story, as it\u2019s hard to surprise me, really.Honestly, I think this book, and this series, is worth a read for Dante alone.
