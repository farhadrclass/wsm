And while the plot seemed a bit far fetched to me at times I still enjoyed all the twists and turns. Jennifer reminded me of someone I once knew who was strong, independent and capable of excelling at whatever she put her hand to in spite of less than ideal circumstances. Not your average character or your average woman, Jennifer has it all together externally and doesn't stop long enough to reflect on the true state of her life and whether God cares about her.Harrison is the type of guy that every woman dreams of. He respects his parent's, cares for his wayward brother and clearly demonstrates his care for Jennifer. While his past isn't perfect and his track record in regard to Jennifer is rough at best, he realizes his need for God and seeks to honor Him. And if he sometimes seems too good to be true, he is still the type of guy that every girl dreams of being pursued by.Abandoned Identity was an enjoyable read - a fast paced story of two lives and the overseeing hand of God.
