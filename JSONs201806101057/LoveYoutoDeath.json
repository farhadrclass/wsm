So when one of her exes turns up dead, she is the number one suspect. This is when she gets reacquainted with Ben Orr, a detective and former classmate. The characters are great. Abby was funny, cute, but sometimes she annoyed me as well. Ben was the hot, smart detective who was also funny and sweet. I thought they had great chemistry. I just wish there was more about Ben's past. I thought the character development was great too. The characters were engaging to read.I thought this book was funny, sweet, and loving.

She already has the worst luck with men and discovers that her ex-boyfriend has been found murdered. The cop investigating the murder happens to be the guy she had a major crush on in high school. She soon learns that attempts were made on two other exes and she is the prime suspect for all three crimes. It\u2019s bad enough that you\u2019re being investigated by your high school crush for crimes you did not commit, but adding insult to injury, he doesn\u2019t even remember you! Your family claims they believe in your innocence but they start acting strange, don\u2019t want you around your newborn nephew and even insist you be accompanied by a police escort to your bridesmaid\u2019s dress fitting for your sister\u2019s wedding!I completely understand that Ben is just doing his job, but I started to get annoyed at his insistence that she \u201ccould\u201d have done it and \u201cit\u2019s possible\u201d instead of not appearing to look at anyone else as the suspect. Even when there\u2019s evidence that someone Abby knows is committing the crimes, Ben still asks Abby if she planted it! If it wouldn\u2019t have made her situation worse, I would have cheered Abby slapping him a good one! The list of possible suspects is large. It could be anyone starting with the dead ex-boyfriend\u2019s new fianc\u00e9e, to Abby\u2019s family, to her co-workers and even her friends. Sadly, everyone seems to believe it\u2019s Abby and people are walking around on eggshells around her, which I found highly insulting, but there isn\u2019t much to be done to help the situation except prove her innocence. It was next to impossible for me to figure out who did it as I was likely to believe any of the people in Abby\u2019s life were capable. When the culprit is revealed, I was surprised and a little disappointed that I didn\u2019t pick up on it sooner. The story moved very slowly for me until Ben starts to entertain the possibility that someone close to Abby could be responsible for the crimes. By then I was pretty frustrated at Abby\u2019s insistence of innocence falling on deaf ears and more agitated that there were no signs of interest in Abby coming from Ben, except as a perp. Probably a good thing as there is a killer watching and Ben could have ended up on the killer\u2019s list of targets. Overall, this was a good book. I really enjoy the mix of chick-lit and mystery. As frustrating and annoyed I as I was at the lack of passion in this story, I have to applaud Ben\u2019s ethics and integrity. Fortunately, he steps up when Abby finds herself face to face with the killer so all ends well. I recommend this to fans of both the chick-lit and cozy mystery genre that are looking for something light to read and don\u2019t mind the lack of passion and romance for our heroine."}, {"userName": "Aparajita Mukherjee", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15564946-aparajita-mukherjee", "userReview": "Abby is a prime suspect in the murder of one of her ex-boyfriends, and she is also being accused of attempting to murder two of her other ex-boyfriends. But she is an extremely sweet, caring, generous person and it almost broke my heart by the way most people treated her. Her jackass good-for-nothing ex-boyfriends, her step-family, her colleagues at work, almost all of them deserve a seat in hell, including the hot Detective Benjamin Orr, who of all people should have understood her. Only a handful of people stood by her side. Even the killer, in spite of being criminally insane, is better than her step-mother and step brother-in-law. Even before the murder mayhem, her life was miserable enough, and she was constantly being stepped upon by almost every person she loved. Their lack of trust in her is heartbreaking.

As the book opens, her current boyfriend just leaves her at a Land's End when they were supposed to be attending her nephew's bris. The dude just freaks out about a baby circumcising party. Of course, everyone at the party is all, \"Abby knows how to pick them!\" Granted, Abby's boyfriends suck. One tackled her so that she wouldn't catch the bouquet at her half-sister's wedding, subsequently breaking her aunt's ankle. The worst of them all brought his cousin Mary to Abby's birthday party. They were found engaged in a sexual act in Abby's bed. Soon after her Land's End abandonment, Abby spots ex Tom's engagement announcement to his not-really-cousin Mary-Kate. Then Tom turns up dead, and Abby is a suspect. Detective Benjamin Orr is investigating Abby. Coincidentally, he is also her secret high school crush. She has these full-on hallucinations about him. I'm embarrassed for her. Two more ex-boyfriends report attempts on their lives near the time they broke up with Abby. Her co-workers are super nice so that she won't ax murder them. She even gets a promotion and vacation out of the deal. With all her whining about how her life is falling apart, it's not difficult to say that Abby isn't very sympathetic. She's supposed to be this everygirl. \"I was awkward and invisible in high school.\" \"I'm short and have unattractive brown hair.\" \"The policeman assigned to investigate my murder case won't just date me!\" Love Me to Death is some sort of unholy union between chick lit and mystery. It was addictive and readable, but I spent most of my time rolling my eyes at Abby. There's a blurb on the last page that says to look out for the second Abby Foote mystery next year. The book was published in 2007, and no sequel was released.

The heroine, Abby Foote had just been dumped at the LL Bean on the way to her new nephew's bris. Apparently, her latest love didn't understand what a bris was all about so he ran out on her while he was supposed to be trying on a new shirt. Apparently, most of her past relationships ended with somewhat monumental embarrassment... most of all, her former love, Ted, who was caught getting a bj by \"his cousin, Mary\" at Abby's own birthday party. When Ted turns up dead and apparently two other of her former boyfriends had attempted murders on them, Abby is now the prime suspect. Abby also has a very dysfunctional family created by her father running out on her mother and marrying his secretary. They are not the wicked step sisters by any means, but many of their husbands/boyfriends filed protective orders from her and required a police escort to family functions (which means more time with the deliciously moist Ben! Abby is a phenomenal character in every way. I connected with her witty sarcasm and outlandish fantasies. You really want to keep reading this book for her (although you are slightly tempted by her former crush from high school being the investigating detective). Another aspect that was great about this book was its level of realism about her relationship with the cop, Ben. They spend a lot of time together and she has plenty of inappropriate thoughts about him, but he does nothing to act on any of it until the very end of the book when they have gotten the true murderer. Thank you, Mrs. Senate.... I hate in books when cops screw around with a supposed murderer... I am sure that would be too low even for some of the slime buckets I have met. Anyways, the end of the book said another Abby Foote mystery is coming out in January and this was copyrighted in 2007 so now I am on the prowl.Great chick lit!"}, {"userName": "Houda", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7034346-houda", "userReview": "D'accord, j'ai termin\u00e9 ce livre hier ou plutot ce matin puisque je m y suis coll\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 6h30 du matin.

At times I really loved it and wanted to give it four stars and a few times the main characters overly \"lovey\" thoughts about her detective drove me batty. The way her family treated her also irritated me. Over all though, I really loved the fast pace and the humor of the book, plus the mystery kept me guessing so I recommend it as a fun light mystery."}, {"userName": "Juva", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22497172-juva", "userReview": "A fun novel, full of surprises and a few twists and turns. I genuinely laughed out loud a few times, and the ending wasn't as predictable as you'd think. I love the tension between the main characters, and all the zany things that happen once the people around the protagonist start making assumptions. It's fun and quirky, and I can't wait to read more from Melissa Senate."}], "description": "When did Abby Foote's life become an episode of Law & Order?First, a former boyfriend (who dumped Abby in the most humiliating way imaginable) is found murdered the day his engagement is announced. Then two other ex-boyfriends report attempts made on their lives right after breaking up with her. Coincidence? Detective Benjamin Orr, of the Portland Police Department (and Very Probing Questions and Incredibly Delicious Face), doesn't think so. Neither do Abby's friends, family, coworkers and other exes--who are suddenly shaking in their shoes. Soon everyone is sucking up to her as though the Abby they know and supposedly love to death is capable of poisoning their drinks....Is someone trying to frame her?Who? And why? She has to find out fast. Because by-the-book Ben is bound to break her heart.
