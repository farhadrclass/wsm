Like all the others it involves two lovebirds wanting to marry after a few hours of knowing each other but shenanigans ensue and people burn to death. You know, the usual.Except Nora does end up locked in an attic by her father, Rapunzel-style but Daniel just busts down the door and rescues her. The good thing about Nora is that her crazy is a little more sedate. Stine had a bad habit of showing the lady folk and their brain squishees completely disintegrating in the face of calamity. Whether they screamed constantly or repeated names until the end of time or became entirely catatonic, the men survived a little better in Stine\u2019s world. Although one of the original Fiers from book one did get a rather epic death in that he laughed himself into insanity and bricked him and his wife into a single room in their house and was left to rot.Another bonus for Stine, he certainly has some creative deaths at his finger tips. I was constantly entertained by the way people died in this series. My favorite was the little Beetlejuice head in book two that replaced a normal head by popping it. Love. It.I didn\u2019t see the small twist at the end of this book coming, although maybe if I paid a little more attention to the details I would have but that\u2019s me for you. It\u2019s not a surprise, really, but it was probably the safest route for Nora because the Fears and the Goodes are just a shitbag combination and shouldn\u2019t be trusted in the same room together.Ultimately this series saturates the land in blood and sets the stage for the whole of Fear Street to come along (albeit having been written after the start of Fear Street, prequels, yay!) and get more people killed. So many deaths and in such interesting ways. God, I love my cheese."}, {"userName": "Lindsay Heller", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5692992-lindsay-heller", "userReview": "I remember when I was little waiting, very impatiently, for this book to be published. It November of 1993 and this was the third, concluding, book of the Fear Street Saga, the historical horror trilogy that explained why Fear Street, in R.L. Stine's Fear Street series of books, was so haunted. I got it for my birthday, immediately tore in, and was not disappointed. This book continues the story of the Fears (who have now changed the spelling from Fier) and the Goodes, two feuding families not opposed to using the \"dark arts\" to exact revenge upon each other. This book mostly deals with Simon Fear and his immediate family. In the previous book, 'The Secret', Simon's two sisters both fell in love with the same Goode and paid the price, now Simon's heart is hardened. When he meets Angelica Pierce in New Orleans he knows she's for him, he just doesn't realize how much. But the curse follows them, even when they settle into the notorious Fear mansion in Shadyside. So, I mean, was this written in, probably, a month and then released only in mass backs for a bunch of thirteen year olds to pour over? Yes. Is it good? I'm going to go ahead and say yes. This whole series is good. It's creative. And to a kid who liked ghost stories, I couldn't have asked for better."}, {"userName": "Estrella", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2721136-estrella", "userReview": "That was one of the first books i ever read from R.L. Stine and it's still my favorite till this day. You cant really explain what this book is about because it has so many twists and turns that it leaves you stunned at the end. When i read this book it was like a movie in my head because i could see exactly what she was describing. She made The Burning with so many vivid details that I actually thought i was watching it and forgot to close the turn of the T.V when i finished.I think this was one of her most greatest books i have ever read and it did make me love the genre mystery thanks to this book I love reading mysteries.

This is my least favorite of the three books. It claims Simon\u2019s story is the evilest of all, but in truth, you get only samplings of his life. To be honest, I wish Stine had a companion series of the Goodes during these same years. It would be extremely interesting to discover how the timelines converge the way they do throughout the books and what happened to the Goode family during the years away from the Fiers/Fears.Also, in looking back on the stories, there are only two instances in all of the tales, in which the Goodes actually did any harm to the Fier/Fear family. The first is in book one, when Susannah Goode\u2019s father used magic to look like a young man and worm his way into the Fier\u2019s household. He tricked Mary Fier into loving him and murdered two members of the family. The second takes place at the end of book two, in which Simon\u2019s family takes in a stranger, who says he\u2019s the last remaining Goode and he proceeds to murder most of the family. Truth be told, most of what happens to the Fiers is of their own making.In this particular book, one of Simon\u2019s daughters sets out to murder the other. When she fails and her sister believes she\u2019s accidentally killed her in self defense, she\u2019s buried alive. All of this is blamed on the young maid who happened to be a Goode, but she didn\u2019t actually do anything wrong. Also, how was she a Goode if Simon killed the last one decades earlier?This is why a companion to this series is needed. There are a ton of holes in this story and it would be that much better if you could fill in the blanks."}, {"userName": "Manda", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21443134-manda", "userReview": "Nomadic SA Chick's Book Reviews\nReview\nI loved this series as a teenager. I probably read the trilogy a hundred times in my teens. I don't know what it was about these books, but I was hooked. Reading them 10 years later as an adult I gave myself a migraine from all the eye rolling I did. I couldn't believe all the cheesy romance lines and easy swooning these ladies did. I mean good lord, a man said hi to these ladies and they wet their knickers with the excitement of wedding planning. It's laughable, but I can see how teen Manda was swept up in this, because what teenage girl doesn't want to believe in love at first sight. While grown up Manda is bitter and critical of love and laughs in its face. Stine has always been one of my favorite authors, and while I don't read much of his works these days, I've kind of aged out of them, I still appreciate everything he's written and all the joy he brought me as a child, starting with my very first Goosebumps book.These books aren't something I will probably ever pick up again, but they will always have a special place in my library, and I would encourage every young girl to read this series. While the ladies in this book fall foolhardy in love like it's going out of style, Stine also manages to write some very strong and fierce women in this book that will help bring courage to the young woman reading it.\nRatings (based on a 10 point scale)\nQuality of Writing - 6Pace - 6Plot Development - 5Characters - 6Enjoyability - 5Insightfulness - 5Ease of Reading - 8Photos/Illustrations - N/AOverall Rating - 3 out of 5 stars"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1535483-mary", "userReview": "This is an amazing great book because it had a lot of colonial times events.It was during the time period which made it very non-fictional because stories like this happened during those time periods!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Lilith Rayne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5724349-lilith-rayne", "userReview": "It was a good read but not as interesting as the previous two.

Over a hundred years since his brother Matthew robbed the girl\u2019s grieving father. Over a hundred years since everything began, but just two since the curse was reawakened and Frank Goode murdered the Fier family in cold blood. Only two years since Simon Fear changed his family name and forswore good. The chain is completed, the end is beginning.The Burning is the third and final book in the original Fear Street Saga by R. L. Stine; it\u2019s also the first of the three to give us a villain protagonist. That\u2019s actually a thing that I appreciate about the book. Having Simon as both our starting protagonist and, ultimately, the antagonist of the book ties things up nicely in a way that the previous two books didn\u2019t. The reader has known that the Fear Mansion was going to burn down at the end, leaving Nora Goode all alone; it\u2019s just been a matter of getting there. The big down side here is that I feel like the first half of the book was really rushed. Pacing has been a problem throughout the trilogy, so it isn\u2019t a huge out of nowhere thing. It\u2019s more another example of needing to get things in place for what comes next and not having the room for much build up. There\u2019s some out of nowhere stuff that I would have liked to have seen more support for, but it\u2019s par for the course at this point.I can\u2019t say that The Burning is the strongest of the three books, which probably still goes to The Betrayal, but it does pretty well for itself. While rushed in a lot of ways, I feel like a lot of the things that are rushed could or would probably be hand waved with the curse if the extra space had been taken to go further in.There\u2019s really not a lot for me to say here. The Burning has its points that work, and work well, but it also shares the same weak points that the rest of the series has. It also has an unfortunate side effect, since the reader knows about how it ends and that Fear Street is ultimately still cursed, of not having a really satisfying ending. It\u2019s just kind of done. So, at the end of the day I think it earned a three out of five. If any single part of it had been a touch better it would have been a four."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5485579-shannon", "userReview": "[the bodies of Simon and Angelica\u2019s two daughters were found in the woods with their bones missing\u2014 all that was left of them being their skins (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Indira", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5952174-indira", "userReview": "This review is for the whole series.
