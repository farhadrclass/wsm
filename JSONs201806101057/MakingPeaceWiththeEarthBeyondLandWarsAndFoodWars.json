I was reading with merely mild rage until the chapter Seed Wars Against the Earth, when I became really annoyed, partly with myself, for not realising how advanced and destructive the corporate (ie Monsanto) agenda already was in some places, such as India which is central here.Probably the most useful thing about this is the clarity and passion with which she explains the massive, far-reaching advantages of a biodiversity economy that respects & values all life & people & the Earth (recognising the essential interconnectedness of everything which surely only the melanin-deficient peoples have taught ourselves not to see) The GM food agenda is thoroughly exposed as driven by unscrupulous corporate interests and full of bad science. I don\u2019t know how many times I will have to read that GM is not needed to \u201cfeed the world\u201d and indeed fuels \u201chunger by design\u201d to be able to confidently call BS and explain why when people say this to me. Hopefully this was the last time.Before this political civilization came to its power and opened its hungry jaws wide enough to gulp down entire continents of the earth, we had wars, pillages, changes of monarchy and consequent miseries, but never such a sight of fearful and hopeless voracity, such wholesale feeding of nation upon nation, such huge machines for turning great portions of the earth into mincemeat - TagoreIf the fathers of capitalist theory had chosen a mother rather than a single bourgeois male as the smallest economic unit for their theoretical constructions, they would not have been able to formulate the axiom of the selfish nature of human beings in the way they did \u2013 Ronnie Lessem and Alexander Schieffer"}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1079443-andrea", "userReview": "Vandana Shiva is pretty amazing. She makes a radical reframing of the environmental and social justice problems we face feel effortless. You can tell she's been talking about this a while.The struggle of a life.The cover looks a little hippy of course, reading it on the train I imagine few people knew that the first chapter sub-title was something like 'Eco-Apartheid as War'. I keep trying to give up my binaries, but the simplicity and clarity of this war is good for struggle, for knowing what you are fighting for:There are two different paradigms for, and approaches to, the green economy. One is the corporate-centered green economy which means:(a) Green Washing - one has just to look at the achievements of Shell and Chevron on how they are \"green\"(b) Bringing nature into markets and the world of commodification. This includes privatisation of the earth's resources, i.e., patenting seeds, biodiversity and life forms, and commodifying nature....(15)Commodification and privatisation are based and promoted on the flawed belief that price equals value...The second paradigm of the green economy is earth-centred and people-centred. the resources of the earth vital to life -- biodiversity, water, air -- are a commons for the common good for all, and a green economy is based on a recovery of the commons and the intrinsic value of the earth and all her species. (17)I didn't need the schooling on all the death-dealing and life-destroying actions of corporations in India to agree with that, but I did need to know more about what is actually happening -- what other basis can we build solidarity in struggle upon? There is much here requiring tears and rage, and so much struggle to support and learn from. In these stories from India you can see that it is a war -- that is often hidden from us here in the U.S., particularly those of us in cities already far removed from the earth and how we are killing it by siphoning off and centralising all of its resources.Since corporate freedom is based on extinguishing citizen freedom, the enlargement of \"free-market democracy\" becomes a war against Earth Democracy.Since the rules of free-markets and free trade aim at disenfranchising citizens and communities of their resources and rights, people resist them. The way against people is carried to the next level with the militarisation of society and criminalisation of activists and movements. (21)Through their struggle against this, they are blazing the way forward for all of us and we need to not just challenge any attempt to criminalise it, but support and learn from it.One of the key things I think is this:LAND IS LIFE. It is the basis of livelihoods for peasants and indigenous people across the third world, and is also becoming the most vital asset in the global economy... Land, for most people in the world, is people's identity, it is the ground of culture and economy. (30)This attachment, love, need for land and home that goes far beyond sale price is something many academics (planners, capitalists) don't understand. This is something I am so infuriated and also fascinated by -- a little more than Shiva is. But of course competing understandings of land and value and their rootedness in histories and capitalism are needed to understand the present conflict and so they are here scattered through the book. Like this:In India, land-grab is facilitated by a toxic mixture of the colonial Land Acquisition Act of 1894, the deregulation of investment and commerce through neoliberal policies, and the emergence of the rule of uncontrolled greed and exploitation. The World Bank has worked for many years to commodify land... (30-31)This fundamental fact that almost no one publishing articles and books and displacing people seems to understand at all:Money cannot compensate for the alienation of land. (31)It goes far back, this idea that land is to be used to generate wealth -- this is an amazing quote from Puritan settler of North America John Winthrop:Natives in New England, they enclose no land, neither have they any settled habitation, nor any tame cattle to improve the land soe have no other but a Natural Right to those countries. Soe as if we leave them sufficient for their use, we may lawfully take the rest. (113)That's it in a nutshell really. Then there's the East India Company, looking at land and its resources only for profit and conquest:As Stebbing reported in 1805, a dispatch was received from the Court of Directors of the East India Company enquiring to what extent the King's Navy might, in view of the growing deficiency of oak in England, depend on a permanent supply of teak timber from Malabar. Thus, the first real interest aroused in the forests of India originated from the colonial centre and the cause was the same as that which had kept forestry in the forefront of England through three centuries -- the safety of the Empire, which depended upon its \"wooden walls\" -- its supremacy at sea. When the British started exploiting Indian timber for military purposes, they did so rapaciously... (116)She looks at ideas of value, where they come from:As the 'trade' metaphor has come to replace the metaphor of 'home', economic value itself has undergone a shift. Value, which means 'worth', is redefined as 'exchange and trade', so unless somethings is traded it has no economic value...The 'trade' metaphor has also rendered nature's economy valueless; the marginalisation of both women's work and nature's work are linked to how 'home' is now perceived as a place where nothing of economic value is produced.This shift in the understanding of economic value is central to the ecological crisis and is reflected in the change in the meaning of the term 'resource'. 'Resource' originally implied life...With the advent of industrialization and colonialism, however, a conceptual break occurred. 'Natural resources' became those elements of nature which were required as inputs for industrial production and colonial trade.The ways that this continues on into our worldview today:Planners do not see our rivers as rivers of life, they see them as 20,000 megawatts of hydro-power. (92)The ways this shifts everything:World Bank loan conditionalities have many paradigm shifts built into them -- the shift from \"water for life\" to \"water for profits\"; from \"water democracy\" to \"water apartheid\"; from \"some for all\" to \"all for some\". (84)The ways that this has shifted through the globalisation of capital and changing nature of corporations and profit-making is here as well, along with it's impact on local and state sovereignty (things that most Americans never have to worry about, even as they are shifting these relationships around the world):The Gopalpur steel plant is a product not of the \"development\" era, but of the globalisation era. Globalisation demands that local communities sacrifice their lives and livelihoods for corporate profit, development demanded that local communities give up their claim to resources and their sovereignty for national sovereignty. Globalisation demands that local communities and the country should both give up their sovereign rights for the benefit of global free trade. (40)The companies making profits on land are very familiar:Morgan Stanley purchased 40,000 ha. of farmland in Ukraine, and Goldman Sachs took over the Chinese poultry and meat industry in September 2008. Blackrock has set up a $200 million agricultural hedge fund, of which $30 million will acquire farmland. (157)Their speculation in food is causing famine, and if you needed more than that, there's a whole range of other evil and horrible things happening. There's a whole lot I didn't really know about GMOs about biofuels (instinctively you feel they must be better than oil, but think again).At least 30 per cent of the global food price rise in 2008 was due to biofuels... (163)On GMOsthe term \" high yielding varieties\" is a misnomer because it implies that the new seeds are high yielding in and of themselves. The distinguishing feature of the new seeds, however, is that they are highly receptive to certain key inputs such as fertilisers and irrigation. Palmer therefore suggested the term \"high responsive varieties\" (HRV) be used instead. (141)Genetic engineering has failed as a tool to control and has instead created super pests and super weeds, because it is based on a violence that ruptures the resilience and metabolism of the plant and introduces genes for producing or tolerating higher doses of toxins. (148)The peaceful coexistence of GMOs and conventional crops is a myth: environmental contamination via cross-pollination, which poses a serious threat to biodiversity, is unavoidable. (186)On industrial production:Overall, in energy terms, industrial agriculture is a negative energy system, using ten units of input to produce one unit of output. Industrial agriculture in the US uses 380 times more energy per ha. to produce rice than a traditional farm in the Philippines...(142)On fertilisers, and the violence of industrial agriculture:Fertilisers come from explosives factories. In recent years, in Oklahoma and Afghanistan, in Mumbai and Oslo, explosives factories were retooled to make fertiliser bombs. (148)These are the fertilisers required to grow Monsanto's crops, also required are pesticides. The violence there, apart from long terms damage to farmers and the planet and everything in the earth and water and air:The pesticides which had created debt also became the source for ending indebted lives. Those who survive suicide in Punjab are dying of cancer. (149)A farmer's organisation presented information on 2,860 farmer suicides at public hearing on 8 September, 2006All this when traditional and organic farming almost doubles the carbon sequestration efficiency, uses a tenth of the water. All this despite the reality that when we step outside the warped logics of capital, we know what's what:The solutions for the climate crisis, the food crisis, or the water crisis are the same: biodiversity-based organic farming systems. (154)It is, as so many have explored, claimed, stated, based on diversity, interconnectedness, networks.As the Knowledge Manifesto of the International Commission on the Future of Food and Agriculture states, the following principles are now generally accepted by the scientific community: (a) living and non-living systems are all dynamically interconnected, with the consequence that any change in one element will necessarily lead to not fully predictable changes in other parts of the network; (b) variability is the basis of change and adaptation while its absence leads inevitably to death; (c) living systems actively change the environment and are changed by it in a reciprocal way. (190)Above all this is a book of struggle, of movements fighting back and learning from them what needs to be part of this struggle:An ecological and feminist agenda for trade needs to be evolved based on the ecological limits and social criteria that economic activity must adhere to, if it is to respect the environmental principle pf sustainability and the ethical principle of justice. This requires that the full ecological and social costs of economic activity and trade be made visible and taken into account. Globalisation that erases ecological and social costs is inconsistent with the need to minimise environmental destruction and human suffering. Localisation - based on stronger democratic decision-making at local levels, building up to national and global levels -- is an imperative for conservation as well as democracy. (257)It holds the voices of different groups asserting different kinds of knowledges and ways of being on the earth that we must now look to for the future:We, the forest people of the world--living in the woods, surviving on the fruits and crops, farming on the jhoom land, re-cultivating the forst land, roaming around with our herds -- have occupied this land since ages. We announce loudly, in unity and solidarity, let there be no doubt on the future: we are the forests and forests are us, and our existence is mutually dependent. The crisis faced by our forests and environment today will only intensify without us.--Excerpt from the Declaration of Nation Forum for Forest people and Forest Workers (69)The need for new structuresSelf-rule of communities is the basis for indigenous self-determination, for sustainable agriculture, and for democratic pluralism. (27)I do love how Vandana Shiva wraps it all up (something I always struggle with). I know things are always messy, but I think in a struggle like this this is the kind of clarity most useful:Humanity stands at a precipice. We have to make a choice. Will we continue to obey the market laws of corporate greed or Gaia's laws for maintenance of the earth's ecosystems and the diversity of her beings? The laws for maximising corporate profits are based on:  Privatising the earth  Enclosing the commons  Externalising the costs of ecological destruction  Creating corporate economies of death and destriction  Destroying democracy  Destroying cultural diversity  The laws for protecting the rights of Mother Earth are based on:  respecting the integrity of the earth's ecosystems and ecological processe  Recovery of the commons  Internalising ecological costs  Creating living economies  Creating living democracies  Creating living cultures (264-265)"}, {"userName": "Venus", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34196867-venus", "userReview": "A plethora of information that is thoroughly sourced, it is a must-read for anyone interested in the topics of food democracy."}, {"userName": "Muthu Arumugam", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19495924-muthu-arumugam", "userReview": "Lots of facts.

If our species is to survive, we must re-imbed ourselves in the earth and become part of the earth community. We must reawaken our duties to protect the earth and our rights as earth citizens to a fair share of her gifts. For this we need to revisit our concepts of growth and prosperity.Making peace with the Earth begins with a paradigm shift from the mechanistic ideas of the earth as dead matter to the earth as Gaia, a living planet, our mother.We need a new paradigm for living on the Earth because the old one is clearly not working. An alternative is now a survival imperative for the human species. And the alternative that is needed is not only at the level of tools, it is at the level of our world view. How do we look at ourselves in this world? What are humans for? And are we merely a money-making and resource guzzling machine? Or do we have a higher purpose, a higher end?Winner of the Sydney Peace Prize, Vandana Shiva is an internationally renowned physicist, activist, and best-selling author of many books, including Staying Alive, Earth Democracy, and Soil Not Oil.", "title": "Making Peace With the Earth: Beyond Land Wars And Food Wars", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13237165-making-peace-with-the-earth", "average": 3.93, "cover": "", "reviews": 5, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/144748.Vandana_Shiva", "name": "Vandana Shiva"}], "type": ["Food and Drink", "Politics", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13237165-making-peace-with-the-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17368956-making-peace-with-the-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22826350-making-peace-with-the-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/587193.Stolen_Harvest", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/278185.Earth_Democracy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/278193.Water_Wars", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4503959-soil-not-oil", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/278186.Staying_Alive"]}
