Thuy is a Vietnamese immigrant to Canada who has worked as a seamstress and lawyer. Ru is an autobiographical fictional account about a Vietnamese girl's experiences before and and after immigrating to Canada. This slim novel won the Governor's Award for best French literature in 2010 and is Thuy's first novel. Growing up in the United States, one learns of the many sides of the Vietnam war. One side students do not learn much about is the fate of Vietnam's people. Thuy writes how a well to do family has their wealth taken from them by the new communist government inspectors. These agents move into the family's compound and track their every move until this once proud family is forced to leave the country when it is no longer safe. Leaving an extended family behind with hopes that they may one day be reunited in safety, the family flees on a rickety boat to Malaysia on their way to Quebec. Ru signifies lullaby in Vietnamese and a small stream of memory in French. Thuy links the two in her beautiful prose as she describes Vietnam before the war. As a member of the upper class, her protagonist and family enjoyed the same wealth associated with the well to do in Europe. This luxurious lifestyle ended with the communist takeover, and Thuy's parents ended up working menial labor jobs outside of Montreal so that their children could enjoy a better life than the one they were forced to flee. Once Thuy has her protagonist find her new voice in French, she becomes a product of the North American dream. A short novel of vignettes, I found Thuy's words to be captivating. Reading of the contrast of prewar Saigon, the detention center in Malaysia, and the new conditions in Quebec are chilling. Living a life of upheaval, Thuy through her protagonist admits, that she does not know how to love until she had her own children. As a mother, she learned the language of love as only she was privileged to give a child some of the unconditional love that she was denied growing up in a prewar, divided country and then later as an outsider. Her children then enjoyed the fruits of her parents labor, and the intergenerational interactions become the most touching scenes of the novel. Although Kim Thuy is not originally an author by profession, her words along with Shiela Fischman's translation, are stunning. Whether it was in describing the imagery off prewar Saigon or a snowfall in Montreal, Thuy's use of prose reeled me in from the first pages. Despite being short in length, Ru is powerful in its message in describing the Vietnamese immigrant experience and then striving to achieve the American dream. I hope that Kim Thuy chooses to write more because this debut was beautiful, and I rate it 4 sparkling stars."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27709782-jen", "userReview": "RU translated in Vietnamese means lullaby. This was a poetic and beautiful short narrative with some very sad moments in the life of Ru, a young girl, who immigrated from Vietnam to Canada. The hardships that were taken to get here was a cost itself, but shedding the Vietnamese cloak of culture which defined her people, truly was a stripping of one's identity. The heartache of leaving what you know, however twisted and sadistic it was, and being turned around in different directions trying to recalibrate oneself with this new reality. I'm stunned by the beauty of this prose and saddened by the life she had to live before she got to a place reflective of that gentle sway. 5*"}, {"userName": "Jaline", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7234171-jaline", "userReview": "This book was originally published in French in 2009, the English translation by Sheila Fischman was published in 2012, and it received the Governor General\u2019s Literary Award 2010.

Towards the end of the book, looking back on her earlier life, the narrator muses \"...after only thirty years I already recognize our old selves only through fragments, through scars, through glimmers of light.\" It is these fragments, the scars and the glimmers of light that Kim Thuy has made the central theme of her book. Like the workings of memory in our brains, nothing is told chronologically; much is only hinted at and, on superficial reading, not developed in depth. Connections between vignettes often hinge on one thought, one colour, one expression...

In Vietnamese, it means lullaby; in French it is a small stream, but also signifies a flow--of tears, blood, money.\" Memory is universal, as is the disenchantment of exile. Try to explain the psychological disentanglement of oneself from the exiled land and culture, and there will still be some confusion. In order to survive, one must not glance back too often, otherwise one risks turning into a pillar of salt. Yet this part is not televised, this psychological inhibition not seen in too many scholarship from the experts. We know how to help current victims, how to raise awareness of travesty, but what about the survivors who live it daily?\nI like the red leather of the sofa in the cigar lounge where I dare to strip naked in front of friends and sometimes strangers, without their knowledge. I recount bits of my past as if they were anecdotes or comedy routines or amusing tales from far-off lands featuring exotic landscapes, odd sound effects and exaggerated characterizations.\nHow does one record those many painful memories that form themselves in flashes across the mind's mirror? If Th\u00fay had tried to publish these fragmented portraits as memoir, I suppose she would have had quite a few rejections. I can also speculate that she had quite a few rejections before this novel was published; as I will suspect there will be many readers who will not be able to grasp the importance of her writing from such a psychological distance, with such lyrical adeptness that the pages are each chapters or standalone poems. It takes grace and adroitness to concur such a feat, to produce heartbreaking lyrics that combine present and past life in captured moments; style that produces harrowing yet dazzling canvases of the individual strength and endurance of people of war. This is antithetical to the structured narrative and plot we're familiar with, and yet it is unique and captivating art. \nAbsolutely no one will know the true story of the pink bracelet once the acrylic has decomposed into dust, once the years have accumulated in the thousands, in hundreds of strata, because after only thirty years I already recognize our old selves only through fragments, through scars, through glimmers of light."}, {"userName": "Sharon Metcalf", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf", "userReview": "Ru is a fictionalised memoir based upon the real life experiences of author Kim Thuy. Told in brief passages, sometimes no longer than a sentence, her words were carefully selected and they packed a powerful punch. Her reflections and memories painted vivid pictures. Collectively they became an exhibition of her life experiences from a young girl in war torn Vietnam, her family's escape by sea, their time in a Malaysian refugee camp, their introduction to life in Quebec, learning to assimilate and to grasping the American dream. Her gift with words is remarkable. Somehow she managed to incorporate all the senses and evoked an array of emotions. She infused colour and substance and shared her insights and perspectives on motherhood, on love and family.

That's my fault, because the blurb on the back and the information about the book on the Goodreads book page makes it clear that it's fiction, albeit autobiographical fiction. This fact slipped my mind at some point between acquiring the book and starting to read. Like the author, the narrator of the work is a Canadian woman of Vietnamese origin, whose family settled in Canada as refugees. I particularly like the structure of the work - a series of short scenes, linked to each other by by threads created by a thought, an emotion, a place, an event or a character. The structure poetically depicts the way in which thinking about the past works, as each memory triggers another. I also like the way the narrative moves back and forward in time and place, with the adult narrator recalling particular events of her childhood and adulthood in Vietnam and Canada, not in chronological order, but as part of the tapestry of her life woven from memories colliding and coalescing. Another thing I like a lot about the work is the prose, which in French is poetic, yet simple and accessible. However, for some reason, I liked the work more when I thought I was reading a memoir than I did when I realised that it's fiction. I'm not quite sure why, but I think my reaction is connected to the direction in which the narrative moves towards the end of the novel. Suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, there are scenes which have little to do with the refugee experience and the themes of memory, dislocation and belonging which are central to the first part of the work. Those scenes feel forced, rather than organically connected to what happened previously.Still, this was an interesting book to read, all the more so because I'm currently reading another autobiographical novel, far removed in place, time and themes - George Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London.

Blurring the line between fiction and nonfiction, Ru is the story of one woman's life as she leaves Vietnam with her family, survives the harrowing experiences of a refugee camp, and finally immigrates to Montreal. What sets this book apart from the typical immigrant story is the format, which sees the story bouncing back and forth in time, each chapter (I loosely use the term) ranging from a single sentence on a page to three pages. For the first few \"chapters\" I was frustrated, but soon enough the themes started to click with me and the nonlinear flow of the tale made a great deal more sense. The prose is lyrical, filled with metaphor, and unique turns of phrase. In some ways it almost feels like jazz: experimental, moving to and fro between times, interlacing experiences in ways that stay true to the main theme. This is a story about a woman who is showing her path to her multi-cultural identity and the experience of the immigrant. Rather than being Canadian or Vietnamese, is she some hybrid of the two, or does the immigration experience somehow affect how her cultural identity was shaped in some entirely new way? These questions are asked of the reader implicitly, and the answers are left up to the interpretation of said reader. What's more, Th\u00fay touches on peripheral characters who had radically different experiences, or immigrants she meets in Canada, sharing a connection to them through their shared displacement. These moments, in their shortened form, breathe life into a whole group of people who have settled in Canada to build a life that is impossible in their home countries. This year's selection of CANADA READS books are competing for the title of the book that \"can break barriers in Canada.\" Highlighting such a diverse group of cultures, and melding cultural identities, that make up the Canadian populace makes this a worthy book for the title. This book frames the way in which immigration is looked at and, despite not being tenable for a longer novel, the truncated sections work very well to compliment the multifaceted nature of the Vietnamese immigrants who touched down in Montreal. My only complaint is that this is not a typical novel, and is more experimental than I had originally anticipated. Nothing wrong with this of course, but it lacks cohesion as a normal narrative, but has such thematic consistency that it almost doesn't matter. Definitely a book that is worth the short time it takes to finish, and highly recommended to any Canadian!"}, {"userName": "Celia", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30261451-celia", "userReview": "The reading of Ru is to experience life from the horrible to the sublime.

The afterword in the book clearly provides a timeline of what has happened and I have copied some of it to share:The narrator is ten when her family is forced to flee their home and luxurious lifestyle in Saigon because of the Communists.

The English translation by Sheila Fischman (a specialist in translating French-Canadian literature) was published in 2012, and was shortlisted for Canada's prestigious Giller Prize. It's quite a feat - considering that Ru is Kim Th\u00fay's debut novel, which she published at the age of 41.Despite its short length, Ru must have taken a long time to be composed and written down - years, possibly even decades. Although the novel is a work of fiction, it obviously draws heavily from Th\u00fay;s own experiences. Like her narrator, An Tinh, she was born to prosperity in Vietnam during the year of the monkey, but also the year of the Tet Offensive, which tore the country apart. Th\u00fay and her family fled South Vietnam in boats with thousand other refugees, taking shelter in refugee camps in Malaysia before arriving thousands of miles away, in Quebec, and settling in the suburbs of Montreal. Because they spoke French, many Vietnamese refugees chose to settle in Quebec - which became one of the most populous destinations for Vietnamese immigrants coming to Canada during that time, second only to Ontario.In Vietnamese, Ru means 'lullaby'; in French, it represents a small stream, but also signifies a flow. The duality of the title represents the novel very well - The flow of hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese refugees across the oceans to many various destinations, a flow of the stream of life towards the new world. This story - repeated so many times, but unique with each single one - can be a lullaby of sorts for their descendants, who grew up in the safety and prosperity that most of their parents never had.Th\u00fay's book is particularly interesting since she and her family came to Canada, instead of the United States - which, despite the close proximity of and the long relatiosnhip between the two countries made her life entirely different. Although separated by half of the globr and having completely different identities, in a way both Vietnam and Canada share the same conflict. Like Vietnam, divided into North and South, Canada is also a divided society - in a large part of it people speak French instead of English, and many view themselves as an entirely different society, and twice tried to transform their province into a new, sovereign country. This divide - linguistic, cultural, historical and ideological - combined with the experience of a young immigrant from a completely different society to both Canada and Quebec - could prove for fascinating reading.Sadly, Ru never reaches that potential. The book is composed of vignettes, most no longer than a couple sentence - and can be easily read in one sitting. The whole book has a deeply personal feel to it - as if it was a personal journal kept by the author without any intention for publication (which I guess might just be the case). These vignettes are not arranged chronologically, and touch on the subjects important to Th\u00fay - her upbringing in Vietnam, the escape on a boat and arrival in the refugee camp in Malaysia, later arrival in Quebec and the effort at assimilation there - and the unavoidable feeling of lost identity, hanging neither there or there. There is a scene in which An Tinh returns to Vietnam as an adult, and the waiter at a restuarant does not recognize her as a Vietnamese person - he says that she has adopted \"American\" sensibilities and lost the Vietnamese ones. How does that must feel - return to the place which was your home and find that it is no longer there? Or maybe even worse - it is there and always has been, but you can no longer enter it as a person that used to live there?Each of the vignettes contains a nugget of an idea, a sliver of a theme and a touch of depth, but on the whole the novel feels unfinished - still very much a work in progress. It has the intimacy of a memoir, but the unmistakable look of being framed like a work of fiction. This is another divide present in the book - and just as in her life, I believe that it is an ongoing process which perhaps might never be finsihed, but which is one with which she will deal on her own terms and in her own time.You can watch Kim Th\u00fay speak about Ru and her immigrant experience in a video interview (in English) by clicking here."}, {"userName": "Arielle Walker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6762949-arielle-walker", "userReview": "Beautifully poetic - also one of the more unusual ways of storytelling I've come across in some time.

When the rains came, the ground was white with maggots.Their first year in Canada was in Granby, Quebec, about an hour drive east of Montreal. I have visited Granby several times on business and found the people very pleasant and friendly. Her mother often quoted the proverb she learned at school, \"Life is a struggle in which sorrow leads to defeat.\" \"From my father I inherited the permanent feeling of satisfaction.\"\"...we must never regret what we've left behind.\"5*****"}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill", "userReview": "The word RU, in Vietnamese, means a lullaby. A song. And indeed, Kim Thuy\u2019s RU is a form of lullaby, evocative, lyrical, beautifully composed.This is not a novel, at least in the conventional form.

I have the sense that I may have read this book wrong. It is in an exciting format, short fascinating recollections of a life which is told as it is remembered by a quasi-fictional protagonist. And the writing is. The translation may even be very good. At moments it comes off as poetry, or prose poetry. And this is why I think I may have read this book wrong. Like most poetry, it might demand to be read out loud so that its words could become real, its images pass the intellectual and enter the sensual.But I'm not sure that I read this book wrong.I think it may have just been too well-cooked to be my cup of tea or just undercooked enough to be a little bit disappointing. I mean, it certainly has exciting ideas and themes. It even has them in spades - so many that it is a wonder the novel is so short. Until you realize, towards the end, that nothing has stuck quite right. None of the images that the quite-skilled writing bring to mind really stick because they, like those quick flickers of memory we have in every moment, do not last long enough. They can't form and shape themselves before they are gone and the next vignette is explored and then transported to the next connected thought or recollection.I will say that the book has an exciting form. It moves from person-related-memory to person-related-memory quite fluidly and beautifully. In the end, though, you're not sure what it is all for. It is, after all, a plotless book. Is that the point? Partially, I think. It is a book about memory, and about the difficulty of living in exile, and about the way history scars our present, and the way that refugees never settle down in a new land, and about family, and diaspora. It may even be something quite more than these things. But the threads are loose, and the tapestry of images never form into something whole and complete for itself.All of this is said saying that I did quite enjoy the book, and thought it was a fantastic debut. The author has a great deal of potential, and I look forward to reading her second book, which was just released."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "This was a book of short connecting vignettes, all pertaining to Ru's life past and present.

The word \"ru\" means \"small stream\" in French; in Vietnamese is means \"lullaby\" - both meanings capture both the meandering nature of the story, such as it is, as well as the soothing voice of a woman to her past self, the child of her memories, as well as her own children. The word, according to the blurb on the book, also signifies a flow - of tears, blood, money. This too resonates with the passage An T\u1ecbnh finds herself on with her once-affluent family, from luxury estate to destitute boat people to new immigrants in Canada, struggling to balance their cultural heritage with the world they find themselves in.When I started reading this, I was struck by the beauty of the language. The very first page, the first vignette, reads like a spoken word poem and gave me a good feeling: this was going to be a book I would love. Alas, it was not to be. But let me share that first page with you, so you can see what I mean:I came into the world during the Tet Offensive, in the early days of the Year of the Monkey, when the long chains of firecrackers draped in front of houses exploded polyphonically along with the sound of machine guns.I first saw the light of day in Saigon, where firecrackers, fragmented into a thousand shreds, coloured the ground red like the petals of cherry blossoms or like the blood of the two million soldiers deployed and scattered throughout the villages and cities of a Vietnam that had been ripped in two.I was born in the shadow of skies adorned with fireworks, decorated with garlands of light, shot through with rockets and missiles. The purpose of my birth was to replace lives that had been lost. My life's duty was to prolong that of my mother. [p.1]It sets the scene well, introducing us to our narrator - now a mother of two boys living in Montreal in the present day - as well as to what life was like around the time of her birth. Fleeing as a refugee feels imminent, and in a way, it is: the vignettes aren't told - or shared - in chronological order; they jump around in time and location, and many are like snapshots, a scene, a memory, frozen in time and set on a loop, the only things left of a life, a world, long gone. I read this for a book club and one of the other people there mentioned that she had heard or read that Th\u00fay jotted these down in her car while waiting at red lights, which helped her read it because that is the way our memories come to us, in bits, randomly, suddenly, a flash across the mind. But for me, it only added to the sense that this memoir disguised as a novel lacked structure and focus, and without some of both, I held in my hands just that: random scribblings, put together in a sloppy, lazy way, where the moments of poetry cannot make up for the unreliable narrator and the lack of cohesion.It's not that I wanted this to conform to the standard structure of a novel, not at all. I'm all for the experimental novel, even the ones I'm not interested in reading like the Irvine Welsh book where the guy's tapeworm talks in the margins and, as it grows fatter, takes over from the man's narration altogether (I do, after all, find that I get the most enjoyment and meaning out of stories that use a more sturdy, reliable framework rather than some pretentious narrative structure that just distracts from the content - and perhaps tries to hide the vacuousness of the story itself). But sometimes you read a book where it feels like the author really didn't exercise enough control over their artistic, creative impulses. The art comes first, you could say, and then a good writer must shape it, give it form, and breathe life into it. With Ru, I felt like some random person had come across a draft, sketches, notes of a potential novel or pages from someone's diary, all torn up and scattered on the ground, and had picked them up and tried to sort them then given up, and published them just like that.That wasn't actually my problem with reading this. Chiefly, I never managed to connect or relate to the narrator, An T\u1ecbnh - a fictionalised version of Th\u00fay. Part of the problem was the simple fact that I just don't know enough about the Vietnam war or what Canada was like in the 70s to be able to fill in the gaps in context, because there's no historical or political context provided, no background details. I have only a vague understanding of the Vietnam war based on a few classic American movies (and some not-so-classic) and the fact - little known in North America - that Australia fought for the U.S. in that war. Even though I grew up with kids whose dads had been there and had various side-effects, no one talked about that war, no one taught it or studied it. We did have a draft but nothing like the American one, and the men had a choice: go or be in the Reserves. When my dad's birthday was called, he chose the Reserves and has many hilarious stories to tell of what he and these other young men got up to on those weekends. As to the politics behind the war, my understanding is as thinly sketched out as this novel. There are some details about the Vietnam War, but they only served to confuse me most of the time. I couldn't follow the narrative all the time. Even though I read this almost in one sitting, it seemed like one minute the narrator said one thing and the next she contradicted herself. Lines like this: \"The police were ordered to allow all boats carrying Vietnamese of Chinese background to leave 'in secret'. The Chinese were capitalists, hence anti-Communist, because of their ethnic background and their accent.\" [p.44] just left me feeling bewildered. Often within a scene you couldn't tell who she was talking about, as the use of pronouns would follow a proper noun and yet she'd be talking about someone else. It's the kind of book you would need to read at least three times to get to the point of following it better.After some time - a year? - in a refugee camp in Malaysia, An T\u1ecbnh and her family - once so affluent with wealth and a large estate - arrive in Canada as destitute boat people and, as part of a government policy at the time, are settled into the small rural town of Granby, Quebec. An T\u1ecbnh is still a child and one whose life has been uprooted; she latches onto new friends and small kindnesses in a pitiful way, a lost child in a new place, struggling to make a home. Again, my lack of contextual knowledge of Canada at the time made these memories, these scenes, decidedly lacking in a deeper meaning so that they read as superficial - a kind of wishful thinking rather than reality (many people in my book club had personal immigrant experiences to share, that this book made them think of. I'm an immigrant to Canada as well, but as a white English-speaking, Anglo-ethnic woman migrating from Australia to Canada, I don't feel like I had a \"true\" immigrant experience). Everyone in Quebec was so kind and welcoming and helpful to these refugees, these aliens in their midst. In the 1970s. To one who wasn't here to witness it (I wasn't even alive at the time), who didn't have knowledge of this policy or what people were like back then, it was disconcerting and unreal. And you still don't get a sense for An T\u1ecbnh anymore than you do in the scenes of her as a mother in the present, even though small details about her life are so vivid.Speaking of motherhood reminds me to mention that there are some recurring themes and elements in the book, some of them better executed than others. In the beginning she talks about the ties between her and her own mother, something culturally Other and hard to grasp in a way I could even picture; I had expected some more meaningful parallel between this relationship and the one she has with her own two boys (another confusing detail is her relationship status - at one point I was sure she mentioned a husband or father to her children, while later she talks about all her flings, her seeking of pleasure which implies she's a single mother. Frankly I've no idea what the truth is). One parallel that worked well (it wasn't subtle) was the one between north and south Vietnam, and English- and French-speaking Canada.Around that time, my employer, who was based in Quebec, clipped an article from a Montreal paper reiterating that the \"Quebecois nation\" was Caucasian, that my slanting eyes automatically placed me in a separate category, even though Quebec had given me my American dream, even though it had cradled me for thirty years. Whom to like, then? No one or everyone? I chose to like the gentleman from Saint-Felicien who asked me in English to grant him a dance. \"Follow the guy,\" he told me. I also like the rickshaw driver in Da Nang who asked me how much I was paid as an escort for my \"white\" husband. And I often think about the woman who sold cakes of tofu for five cents each, sitting on the ground in a hidden corner of the market in Hanoi, who told her neighbours that I was from Japan, that I was making good progress with my Vietnamese.She was right. I had to relearn my mother tongue, which I'd given up too soon. In any case, I hadn't really mastered it completely because the country was divided in two when I was born. I come from the South, so I had never heard people from the North until I went back to Vietnam. Similarly, people in the North had never heard people from the South before reunification. Like Canada, Vietnam had its own two solitudes. [p.79]Other recurring themes include walls or barriers, especially between people - or peoples - sharing a space, and about being unable to speak. There were several references to shadows which I barely noticed at the time so I have no opinion on that. The novel is very tactile, very engaging of the senses - one of things I did like. In small details sights, smells, tastes, textures are described which does give the narrative a richness, in the way that memories can sometimes be accompanied by a single overriding sense, making the two inseparable.And there were moments of humour, like the young soldiers auditing the contents of their mansion who find their grandmother's dresser drawer full of bras - which they'd never seen before so they decide they're coffee filters (the new puzzle: why are there two of them joined together? After some thought they decide it's because you don't drink coffee alone), alongside moments of tragedy, like her aunt who's mentally handicapped in some way (undiagnosed, this being in Vietnam in the 60s) who used to escape the house and run wild through the alleys until one time she comes home pregnant. The little glimpses of life during the war are poignant and precious.Most of those children of GIs became orphans, homeless, ostracized not only because of their mothers' profession but also because of their fathers'. They were the hidden side of the war. Thirty years after the last GI had left, the United States went back to Vietnam in place of their soldiers to rehabilitate those damaged children. The government granted them a whole new identity to erase the one that had been tarnished. A number of those children now had, for the first time, an address, a residence, a full life. Some, though, were unable to adapt to such wealth.Once, when I was working as an interpreter for the New York police, I met one of those children, now adult. She was illiterate, wandering the streets of the Bronx. She'd come to Manhattan on a bus from a place she couldn't name. She hoped that the bus would take her back to her bed made of cardboard boxes, just outside the post office in Saigon. She declared insistently that she was Vietnamese. Even though she had cafe au lait skin, thick wavy hair, African blood, deep scars, she was Vietnamese, only Vietnamese, she repeated incessantly. She begged me to translate for the policeman her desire to go back to her own jungle. But the policeman could only release her into the jungle of the Bronx. Had I been able to, I would have asked her to curl up against me. Had I been able to, I'd have erased every trace of dirty hands from her body. I was the same age as her. No, I don't have the right to say that I was the same age as her; her age was measured in the number of stars she saw when she was being beaten and not in years, months, days. [pp.82-3]In a way, reading individual vignettes like that is more satisfying and engaging than reading the whole as a novel. I got much more out of that particular vignette, for instance, as I read it again just now than I did as I was reading it for the first time, when I had trouble following it even. It makes so much more sense the second time, and I'm sure the book as a whole would too if I were to re-read it. It would also make more sense to those who have the knowledge, the context, the history to understand what's really going on here. Lacking that, it wouldn't matter how many times I read it, there are parts that just won't make sense to me without the necessary context - some of it cultural and unlearnable. And no matter how many times I could read this, I don't think I would ever find the narrator to be anything other than a vague voice on a page, not a living, breathing woman with a rich and varied past.It's not that Th\u00fay didn't accomplish what she set out to do: tracing a young girl's journey from her war-torn homeland, across the ocean in perilous circumstances to a new home where everything is so vastly different and having to find her place in it. It's that I didn't find she was fully successful in her control of her own writing. Writing takes a lot of work and practice, and authors take a long time - and a lot of drafts and scrapped stories - developing their own style. I am torn in two by Ru: there were elements to it that I greatly admire and even loved, and there is a lyrical, almost magical quality to it that appeals to me no less than the story of a refugee trying to reconcile her past with her new life. But if I can't relate to the narrator, if I can't even follow what's going on half the time, then I just feel alienated rather than engaged, frustrated rather than empathetic. It doesn't matter that this was the point, that, as others have pointed out, her story is fragmented and confused as a true reflection of her life. By the time I got to the end I was just glad it was so short and I didn't have to fight my headache anymore. For a book so beautifully written and with such potential (and trust me, I can see why so many people loved this), it was deeply disappointing for me and the only thing that makes it stand out at all (or makes it memorable at all) is the way it is written, which is not altogether successful."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "Ru, Kim Thu\u0301y, Elmira Pouyamehr (translator)\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0644\u0627\u0644\u0627\u06cc\u06cc\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u06a9\u06cc\u0645 \u062a\u0648\u06cc\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0627 \u067e\u0648\u06cc\u0627\u0645\u0647\u0631\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u06a9\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u067e\u0634\u062a\u06cc\u060c 1395\u061b \u062f\u0631 136 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9786007642879\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u067e\u0646\u0627\u0647\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u06cc\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0645 - \u0642\u0631\u0646 21 \u0645"}, {"userName": "\u0627\u0644\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0627", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24556580", "userReview": "\u0635\u0644\u062d\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0627 \u062a\u0648\u067e \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0646\u06a9 \u0627\u06cc\u062c\u0627\u062f \u0634\u0648\u062f \u0646\u0627\u06af\u0632\u06cc\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0639\u062b \u062e\u0644\u0642 \u0635\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u0647\u0632\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062d\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u062a \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0634\u062c\u0627\u0639\u062a\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u062f\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0642\u0647\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0648\u062f. \u062f\u0631 \u0637\u0648\u0644 \u0633\u0627\u0644\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u067e\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0632\u06cc \u06a9\u0645\u0648\u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u060c \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631 \u062f\u0631 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0635\u0641\u062d\u0627\u062a \u06a9\u0627\u0641\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u062c\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0646 \u0647\u0645\u0647\u200c\u06cc \u0642\u0647\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u0646\u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u060c \u0628\u0646\u0627\u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0622\u0646\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u0631\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0631\u062f \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0636\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646\u062f: \u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0633\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0632 \u06a9\u0648\u0646\u06af \u062f\u0648 \u0647\u0648\u0627\u067e\u06cc\u0645\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0646\u0627\u0628\u0648\u062f \u06a9\u0646\u062f \u062f\u0631 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0647\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0686\u0646\u062f \u0647\u0648\u0627\u067e\u06cc\u0645\u0627 \u0631\u0627 \u0646\u0627\u0628\u0648\u062f \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u061f\u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631 \u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0636\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0627 \u062c\u0645\u0639 \u0648 \u062a\u0641\u0631\u06cc\u0642 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u0645\u0648\u0632 \u0648 \u0622\u0646\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u06cc\u0627\u062f \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06af\u0631\u0641\u062a\u06cc\u0645. \u06a9\u0644\u0627\u0633\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u0628\u062f\u06cc\u0644 \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0646\u06af \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u061b \u0636\u0631\u0628 \u0648 \u062a\u0642\u0633\u06cc\u0645 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0627 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0647\u200c\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0632\u062e\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u0633\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u062f\u0647\u060c \u067e\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0632\u06cc\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0647\u0646\u200c\u067e\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0648 \u0631\u0646\u06af \u0648 \u0644\u0639\u0627\u0628\u200c\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u06cc\u0627\u062f \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06af\u0631\u0641\u062a\u06cc\u0645."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15359786-jen", "userReview": "Such a beautiful, lyrical journey - Ru is so expressive and personal, it felt at times painfully intrusive of the author's memories. This is Thuy's first novel and an incredible feat of poetic beauty. The innovative structure gives it a dreamlike quality which captivated me from the start. A slim, perfectly expressed personal history."}], "description": "At ten years old, Kim Th\u00fay fled Vietnam on a boat with her family, leaving behind a grand house and the many less tangible riches of their home country: the ponds of lotus blossoms, the songs of soup-vendors. The family arrived in Quebec, where they found clothes at the flea market, and mattresses with actual fleas. Kim learned French and English, and as she grew older, seized what opportunities an immigrant could; she put herself through school picking vegetables and sewing clothes, worked as a lawyer and interpreter, and later as a restaurateur. She was married and a mother when the urge to write struck her, and she found herself scribbling words at every opportunity - pulling out her notebook at stoplights and missing the change to green. The story emerging was one of a Vietnamese \u00e9migr\u00e9 on a boat to an unknown future: her own story fictionalized and crafted into a stunning novel. The novel's title, Ru, has meaning in both Kim's native and adoptive languages: in Vietnamese, ru is a lullaby; in French, a stream. And it provides the perfect name for this slim yet potent novel. With prose that soothes and sings, Ru weaves through time, flows and transports: a river of sensuous memories gathering power. It's a classic immigrant story told in a breathtaking new way.", "title": "Ru", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538921-ru", "average": 3.74, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344313674l/13538921.jpg", "reviews": 1149, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3152466.Kim_Th_y", "name": "Kim Th\u00fay"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/218670.Sheila_Fischman", "name": "Sheila Fischman"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538921-ru", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12256885-ru", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13642506-ru", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7574245-ru", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7090627-ru", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18112615-ru", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21116169-ru", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19449840-ru", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33632693", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17697817-m-n", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29844235-vi", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12560586-toi", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34440650-hitomi", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22823103-la-goutte", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
