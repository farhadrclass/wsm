I discovered her great writing when I bought a book suggested by a Goodreads ad: Lingerie Wars. Lingerie Wars is hilarious, and if you have yet to read it, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy. I liked Lingerie Wars only a hair more than Goody Two Shoes, but Goody Two Shoes is a great book in its own right. GTS is about Caroline, a Scottish control freak librarian who thinks she is doomed to live a romance-free life. Her practicality can get in the way of her relationships, but when she meets her match, Josh--who is a famous singer from the U.S.--she isn't prepared for the battle ahead.When they make a business arrangement to get married, sure it seems a little weird at first, but they are both getting something out of it. So what's to go wrong, right? Probably just about everything. Josh has a lot of patience and tolerance for his new controlling fiance, and Caroline can't believe Josh has the nerve to order her around--or simply ignore her orders. Some old characters from Lingerie Wars make a fun return--Betty, the 80-something gossipy and bossy hen. Lake Benson, the hot ex-military Englishman. Ex-lingerie-model Kirsty Campbell, Lake's fiance and Caroline's best friend (one of the MCs of Lingerie Wars). And of course Dougal, the unofficial mayor of Invertary. As the new couple deal with the complications of fame and fortune, each one learns something about the other and assumptions take a back seat.I love the way Ms. Henderson's writing makes the story an easy read--which is hard to do. And I love the funny moments throughout, with just the right amount of sexy added in. The characters are great and well-developed, and I found myself rooting for Caroline and Josh. What it boils down to is this: I loved this book and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a romcom read with sexy tension. Also, I can't wait for book three in this series!"}, {"userName": "Jane Stewart", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart", "userReview": "3 \u00bd stars. I enjoyed it. Had a few chuckles.This is book 2 in the series. It wasn\u2019t as good as book 1 \u201cLingerie Wars\u201d but I still liked it. What I like about the author is fun and different personalities which provide natural humor and conflict as they interact.Toward the end I was a little tired of Caroline putting herself down and thinking she wasn\u2019t good enough for him. But I was still ok with the story.Josh was a famous singer and didn\u2019t want to choose a wife from the fans and surgery enhanced women who surrounded him. He asked his friend and business manager Mitch to find him a wife. The author didn\u2019t \u201cshow\u201d how Mitch or someone found Caroline. I did not like that - I wanted to know. The story begins with Josh showing up in Invertary and telling Caroline that he wants to marry her. From the beginning and during all of the book Josh appears to really like and desire her. I did not understand that. I wanted to be inside Josh to see what he liked about her and why.THE SERIES:Book 6 will be published in 2016. Each book is a stand alone romance about people living in the small town of Invertary in the northern Scotland Highlands. Main characters in one book have small roles in other books.

Josh believes in commitment over romance so when he decides to get married, he asks his friend to arrange one for him and ends up proposing to the first woman he meets, a Scottish woman who feels very protective over the castle he just bought in her town. This was so not my book. I really truly genuinely disliked Josh deeply - for someone who was called so laidback, he was far more of a control freak than Caroline - he would call her what he liked, even after she protested, the marriage would happen on his timeline, the kissing and sex would happen on his timeline, their post-marriage lives would be at his discretion, and nothing she said ever really mattered. There were some really funny moments (especially with the vicar), but my blood pressure kept going up with Josh's scenes. I flipped to the end to see if the book was about him learning to be a real partner, but that doesn't seem to be the case at all. Big disappointment, the plot idea was fun but I just couldn't bear the characters.

I loved the premise: busy American celebrity, Josh, is disillusioned with the groupies , one-night stands, and women fawning over him, his money and his fame. He is ready to settle down and have kids, but not with any of the women he has been dating. He buys a castle in Scotland for use as a sound studio and vacation home. Then he demands his agent, Mitch, search out appropriate candidates for an \"arranged marriage.\" Not a believer in \"love matches,\" Josh believes this old fashioned approach will assure him a solid, committed marriage, like that of his parents. Mitch introduces him to Caroline, local town librarian, do-gooder, old maid, and in Josh's opinion, a dead-ringer for \"Grace Kelly.\" Josh is immediately taken with her. Caroline, however, is not happy with Josh or Mitch. She does not like what they've done or are planning to do with the historic castle. When Josh proposes his \"arrangement\" she grabs it for two reasons: it may be her only chance at marriage and children, and she extracts a condition that she be placed in charge of the castle renovation. What follows is a merry mess, a zany comedy of errors, miscommunications, and misunderstanding that threatens the peace and sanity of the whole village. If you like light romantic comedy, reminiscent of Hollywood movies from the 1930s, you'll probably like this book."}, {"userName": "Sue Moore", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75942661-sue-moore", "userReview": "Romance, Love, Solid Characters, Great Story Lines!!I would recommend this highly because the characters were so real, able to change, able to love, and able to reach out to each other. Marriage should be a deep and abiding love with a healthy sex life that never truly wanes as long as both are willing to reach out and continually rejuvinate. Also, whoever proofed this for spelling and grammatical errors? A job well done, for sure. I have not seen a book this grammatically correct in ages, so it CAN be done!!I love that even the parents found their way with the help of the kids.
