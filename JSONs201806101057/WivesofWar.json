Well, to some extent it did, but there were other issues besides romance... Lots of historical errors, which is surprising since WWII is not that far removed from the modern idiom, and Wiki is sooo convenient for the casual researcher.Lots of clunky and jarring Americanisms abound, almost from the first page to the last. If one's heroines are going to be English and quasi-Irish, then it behooves one to know how they spoke in 1944. Oddly enough, it isn' like some folks do in Middle America, circa 1950. I did find the author's attempts to slip in a few \"Britishisms\" amusing--\"to do one's bit,\" for example, occurred with astonishing frequency.Upper class young English women were reserved in their manner and speech. They did not, despite any imagined proclivities toward house servants, introduce themselves by their Christian names--and I shudder to think anyone was actually named \"Scarlet,\" despite the popularity of Gone with the Wind [and whose Scarlett had two ts]--nor say such nonsense as \"Pleased to meet you.\" There were far more examples, but you can find them for yourself.The allegedly Irish Ellie is a cliche from first to last, and not a particularly good one. So is the \"heroic\" Lucy, whose courage is supposed to shine like a beacon through the fog of war and save everybody. The characters are so one-dimensional, with utterly predictable \"romantic\" interests, that I simply didn;t care about any of them.And then there is the author's strange tendency to have her female characters forge strong, everlasting, all-encompassing, and tight bonds of friendship that will sustain them throughout the rest of their lives, and certainly until the end of the book, within five minutes of meeting each other. So we have Scarlet and Ellie in the railway station [anyone wonder why they have the same types of tickets when Scarlet would obviously travel first class and Ellie third?], and Scarlet, Ellie, and Heroic Lucy at the hospital. Instant friendship--not likely. Not like this. Not with these types of women, if they were true to life. Ah, but they aren't, are they?I skimmed to the end because my interest waned rather quickly and because I've read far better, more complex, and more rewarding novels about women in the European theater of operations. The characters were flat, the writing either pedestrian or visibly trying too hard, and the historical bloopers unforgivable, at least to me. Of course there will be--and apparently already are--scores of readers who will think this is a wonderful novel, and find nothing whatever wrong with it. I'm truly happy for them because we all should enjoy whatever we choose to read. Unfortunately, this was not the book for me."}, {"userName": "Suzanne Leopold", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9004645-suzanne-leopold", "userReview": "Two British nurses volunteer to work at a battlefield hospital during World War 2. Scarlet is seeking information about her soldier fiance since his correspondence has ceased. Ellie has prior experience as a nurse and feels that she can contribute immediately to the war effort. Both women are apprehensive about the risks involved but they are determined to make a difference. Their paths converge while on a train headed to their assignment and a lifelong friendship is formed. In France they meet Lucy, an experienced nurse who is charge of operations. At first Lucy shows no interest in developing friendships but eventually she takes the women under her wing. While stationed in Normandy, the fighting escalates and they encounter tireless amounts of soldiers. The casualties are horrific and the working conditions are poor. Scared that they might never make it home, they remain courageous, and rely on one another for support. This story has a nice mix of historical fiction and romance. It shows how deep bonds can develop during the worst of times. I enjoyed this novel by Soraya M.

Most of the time, books come my way and if it sounds like something I might like or in the mood for, then I review it.However with Wives of War, I saw the book on my Twitter feed and it totally grabbed my attention and for one reason\u2026.I loved the cover. In my never fending Twitter feed, I see tons of books go by. But with this one, the cover caught my eye which promoted me to read the description.It sounded like something totally up my alley so I asked if I could review it. I was thrilled when the author agreed. I\u2019m a sucker for WWII novels with romance but this sounded different because it also focused on the the friendship between two women.I really really loved this book. Sure there were technical things that were a little irritating and wanting, but on the whole this was a great read for me.Some things were cliche\u2026..love at first sights, best friends from hello\u2026..that sort of thing. Sure it was unlikely and a little juvenile but yet I personally didn\u2019t mind.There were some historical inaccuracies but I am willing to give the author creative license with that because this isn\u2019t a history book, this is a historical FICTION book so any mistakes the book had weren\u2019t really that big of a deal for me. I like character driven novels so setting is often secondary. If you are looking for something heavy on the historical research then you might want to look elsewhere.I noticed that some of the dialogue lacked the ring of authenticity. There were a lot of American phrases and lingo but yet the characters were supposed to be British. So that was a little bothersome but again, I didn\u2019t go into this book thinking everything was going to be spot on when it came to historical accuracy. I read it because I wanted something casual.So what did I like about this book? I was in it for the characters and the romance. I loved the three female leads. They were interesting and believable characters. I cared what happened to them and wanted them each to find love. I felt attached to each of them and wanted to share in their hopes and felt sad at their miseries.Some reviewers complained about the \u2018insta love\u2019 amidst the horrors or war but honestly that didn\u2019t bother me. In fact I felt like it actually worked rather well and gave a ring of truth to the romances. Often in times of war, soldiers (and nurses) don\u2019t know if they are going to live and die so suddenly this \u2018live in the moment\u2019 mentality takes over and things happen quickly\u2026.typically more quickly than in normal circumstances. There were a number of marriages wheres couples met while a soldier was on leave for two weeks and suddenly married when he returned to his post. So the whole insta love in a war rang true for me. While others might not have liked it, I thought it was fine.Overall I really really liked this book. The story moved quickly and I loved watching the romances unfold. The war played a big role in the novel and helped create an atmospheric novel that I think many readers will enjoy, especially for those who love WWII romances (like me). It had the perfect mixture of sadness/tragedy, love, and friendship. A very worthwhile summer read!See my full review here"}, {"userName": "Squeaky", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1369403-squeaky", "userReview": "This is not historical fiction, this is a romance book with some very weak historical facts trying to hold it together. A disappointed Kindle First read book. According to the description it was supposed to hit right in my sweet spot... WW2 historical novel, with nurses as the main focus. This sorely disappointed. Besides the HUGE historical mistakes, the writing was sophomoric. Every thing that happened to Scarlet (not a name I would think someone of upper class Britain would name their daughter in the 1920's), is reflected back in detail. The plot is mired in this back and forth back and forth. \"Scarlet turned to the girl on her right, Rose. She'd spent some time with her the night before caring for a patient with a head injury... \" Action, and then back action. We're leaving the old house, the old house we stayed in for 2 days- dark and mysterious, the small bed... yada yada. Also the best friends for life thing was established in the first minutes of the novel, the man of affection is established by 7% and then everything aligns to fit. This is beyond cheesy, absolutely no depth, and I feel gypped out of my Kindle First Read."}, {"userName": "Anne OK", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/285610-anne-ok", "userReview": "FIRST AND FOREMOST, let me emphasize that this book is categorized as \u201cFICTION.\u201d\u00a0 There may be some readers that take issue with the extent to which the author has taken liberties with the historical details -- but I still found its message to be an interesting journey back in time to the days of those brave warriors who have been pronounced by many as the \u201cgreatest generation.\u201d \u00a0And secondly, after reading several reviews comparing Wives of War to a \u201challmark romance,\u201d I felt the need to clarify that I happen to enjoy a weekend visit to the Hallmark Channel.\u00a0 Yes, they are clean as a whistle, but they always carry a nicely wrapped message to pass along that brings no harm to anyone.I'm a sucker for a good WWII romance, and the cover on this book immediately drew my attention.\u00a0 After reading the book blurb, I one-clicked hoping for another winning historical fiction from this era.\u00a0 And, indeed, I found exactly that. \u00a0A character-driven novel cast against the backdrop of World War II, portraying three young British women who, for very different reasons, train and volunteer for service as battlefield nurses during the days just prior to D-Day until the end of World War II. \u00a0The story is told from the perspective of each of the three main characters.\u00a0 The landing on Normandy was especially meaningful for me because, throughout my life, I\u2019ve heard my dad tell his stories of driving his tank onto the beach and into hell where he lost his best friend that day.\u00a0 The author maps the progression of the friendships between the three strangers, their triumphs over fears they never imagined, and finally their own personal love stories found on war torn battlegrounds.\u00a0 I loved getting acquainted with Scarlet, Ellie and Lucy, and I was captivated with each one\u2019s background, upbringing and motivation.Scarlet reigns from wealth.\u00a0 Her family is unhappy with her decision to join the war efforts.\u00a0 With her fianc\u00e9 missing in action, she hopes that being closer to the frontlines will aid in finding him. \u00a0From a more modest background, Ellie is a charming Irish lass, who is kind-hearted and giving. \u00a0And Lucy is the strong and smart one -- she works hard and hides her true self behind a hardshell on the outside. The storyline is predictable but still captivating.\u00a0 Romance is central to the story and passionately written, but the non-explicit sex scenes shouldn't offend anyone.\u00a0 The writing style is straightforward.\u00a0 And that may have been purposely planned regarding the time period, setting and nature of the matters at hand.\u00a0 The pacing was even and moved along at a nice clip.\u00a0 Characterizations could have been developed a bit stronger in my opinion.Oh sure, in some cases there was a necessity to stretch the imagination regarding the cases of insta-love matches and BFF (best friends forever) from the start.\u00a0 Most times, those are far-fetched.\u00a0 And yes, there were some historical inaccuracies \u2013 but you were forewarned that this isn\u2019t a textbook, but fiction.\u00a0 All in all, I enjoyed reading this nicely put together saga that perfects the blending of sadness and joy, loss and growth, with friendship and love."}, {"userName": "Allison6876", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3918902-allison6876", "userReview": "I'm a fan of both WWII and romance novels so I had high hopes for this book.

It\u2019s told from all three of their perspectives and I equally enjoyed hearing from each other them. Scarlet is from a well off family and her family is not pleased when she joins the war effort. Although she wants to help as much as she can, she\u2019s also hoping while she\u2019s away she can find her missing fianc\u00e9. Ellie is from a more humble background, she\u2019s a charming, fun Irish lass with a heart of gold and then there is Lucy, a smart, hardworking woman with a tough exterior. They were all inspiring, strong young women willing to take risks to do what is right. As much as the story focused on the friendship between the women it was also heavy on the romance as well. There were three separate love stories that also intertwined at times and though there were cases of instant love and intense romances, I wasn\u2019t bothered here because I think it fit the time period. These young people were so scared and facing such an uncertain future that they clung to one another just to have some small slice of happiness in their lives. I found it to be hopelessly romantic and totally swoon worthy! All the leads changed dramatically throughout and I loved cheering them along as they grew and matured. I so wanted them all to find happiness and their relationships with each other were sweet and endearing.

It was a bit of a disappointment, with young women falling in love at first sight in spite of the horrors of war around them. Resolution of problems happens very simplIstically and improbably. Yet I did keep reading, and did care about the characters.  There were some errors of context, with these British women seeming more American in their speech, and in some phrases and actions not fitting into the 1940's. As for the GI who couldn't remember his name...did they not have dog tags then? If this were simply a romance book, it would be fine.

The devastation described in this book clutched at my heart. It is stark and heartbreaking. I felt the deep pain of these characters. They are each strong and capable in their unique way yet their delicate emotions get rip to shreds with the demoralization of human life all around them. This emotional tearjerker will leave you breathless. It will stir your soul. It will wreck havoc with your mind. It is hilarious at times but the dreadful war taking place within the pages will bother you. I saw the brutal scenes through the eyes of each character stretch out before me in dramatic detail. I loved Ellie and Scarlet. Though they come from different backgrounds\u2014Ellie is a poor country girl and Scarlet is the belle of society girl\u2014they connect and bond instantly. Sharing mutual sisterly respect for each other and keeping each other's spirits up when everything around them fall apart. Scarlet doesn't act privileged in any way. I admired her. She showed how courageous she is by leaving her family to become a nurse with hopes of finding her dear Thomas, her fianc\u00e9. Her journey throughout the book is tough and eye opening. It is on the train, to her station as a nurse, where she meets Ellie and their friendship is sealed at that moment. Ellie is charming and brave with always a ready smile to cheer the downtrodden. But behind her smile hides her fear. I wanted to reach out to her and tell her to keep being brave. Handsome Dr. Spencer takes her mind off things only if it's just for a while. Lucy. What can I say about her? She has seen death and injury up close. She\u2019s seen a doctor take his life, seen soldiers die... I don't think I have the guts like her to be where she is and see what she has and still be strong throughout it all. James. James is tender, wise and sometimes he speaks his mind. I found his wisdom to be soothing. The passionate chaos that is his attraction to Scarlet is a bright light under a gloomy, horribly dank Sussex sky. On the ship while sailing to Normandy, he\u2019s there too and without knowing that his presence gives Scarlet the strength to keep it together when all she wants is to fall apart. To flee. To return home. But she doesn\u2019t.What shocked me the most was that first plot twist! I literally gasped when I reached that part, because I never for one second saw it coming. Now, I can go on and on about this book but I won't. Not because I'm lazy (I'm not) but rather because I feel if I did continue I might slip up and reveal vital bits of the plot. In summation, here are just a few reasons why Wives of War by Soraya Lane consumed me from the start and found a place in my heart:1.\tIt is a captivating, emotionally stirring, haunting and raw. Once you start reading you find yourself not wanting to put the book down! \u2018War changes you, makes you realise the errors of the past sometimes,\u2019 James replied.2.\tThe lush prose.\u2018I think of that night so often \u2013 the way he kissed me when it was dark, when no one could see. Our teeth kind of bumped and his moustache was bristly against my lips, but it was amazing. I mean . . .\u20193.\tThe sometimes inspirational and raw dialogue. \"Smile and the world will see the woman you want them to see, no matter how you feel inside.\"\"There was so little to look forward to, and so much sadness surrounding them. Was it so wrong to anticipate a night of fun?\"4.\tThe courageous cast.\u2018We\u2019re going to be fine, I promise,\u2019 Ellie said, patting her arm as a whistle blew.5.\tThe scenes literally burst to life in your mind.\"At least I know how the other side lives now. We all sat around our dinner table, my brothers and me, with Ma and Pa, and at night Pa\u2019d read to us in front of the fire. We didn\u2019t have a lot, but we had full bellies most of the time and there was plenty of laughter and hugs.\u2019\"Overall, Wives of War is a sterling read from a writer who deserves every bit of praise for such an intense and absorbing tale.Highly Recommended5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Vikki Vaught", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7897287-vikki-vaught", "userReview": "Great read!

Lane is part of a three-book collection that takes readers back to the World War II era. It is 1944 and Scarlet Alexander has joined Queen Alexandra\u2019s Imperial Nursing Service (QA nurses). Scarlet is waiting for the train (and a little nervous) and is happy when Ellie O\u2019Sullivan introduces herself. The pair are reporting for duty and final field training. Scarlet comes from a privileged background and is joining against her families wishes. She has not heard from her fianc\u00e9, Thomas is thirteen weeks and is worried about him. Scarlet feels nursing will allow her to look for Thomas. She knows he is still alive. Ellie has three brothers off fighting and she wishes to do her bit for the war effort. Ellie meets Dr. Spencer Black while training for the front and they are attracted to each other. Scarlet meets a soldier named James who makes her forget about her missing fianc\u00e9. Ellie and Scarlet are soon sent to France where are they inundated with injured soldiers. The unflappable Lucy Anderson is assigned to their unit as a surgical nurse. Lucy wants to enroll in medical school after the war. Rough conditions, little food and long hours are in store for these nurses. Their friendship will help them endure these difficult conditions along with hope and love.I thought Wives of War was easy to read and had a good pace (in most sections). However, Wives of War is a book for readers who enjoy romance novels. Love is in the air for Lucy, Scarlet and Ellie and the war takes a backseat for the majority of the novel. The war in France plays out in the background while these ladies flirt (for the most part). I found the dialogue to be very American. It did not match up with the characters. Scarlet is upper-class British and should speak differently from Irish Ellie. There are a couple of British phrases tossed in here and there but they do not make the novel any more British. I also felt it was lacking in historical accuracy. I am rating Wives of War 3 out of 5 stars. I found Wives of War to be expected (predictable) and a repetition of basic details (how many times were we told Scarlet loved Thomas). I thought the characters were lacking and flat. They were not fleshed out and developed. Friendship blossoms instantly between the ladies (they just met), and then they fall in love just as quickly (Instant connection). I thought it was unrealistic (even for fiction). I wanted a story with more depth (about nurses working in Europe, their patients, etc.) with less focus on women finding husbands in the middle of a battle field. I wish the publisher had written the blurb differently (it is listed as historical fiction). If I had known it was a romance novel, I would have passed. My mother also read this novel and came away with the same impressions (which is rare for the two of us)."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31442223-judy", "userReview": "As historical fiction goes, \u201cWives of War\u201d checks most of the boxes: history, war, friendships, romance and surprises. Scarlet, Ellie and Lucy are three young ladies who become friends while deployed as nurses in WWII. Scarlet is in search of her soldier fianc\u00e9, Thomas, whom she hasn\u2019t heard from in 18 months. Ellie hates the sight of blood, but expects to meet her future husband, possibly a doctor, while working. Lucy is a serious and selfless nurse who focuses on her work and doesn\u2019t think she needs friends. The storyline follows Scarlet, Ellie and Lucy showing how they \u201cstarted out as girls and somehow became women\u201d. I really got to know and like these three women, felt like I was one of them amid the chaos of the triage tents and hoped they would survive the atrocities of war unscathed. The story shadows the women traveling to, setting up and working in military hospitals, attending to injured and dying soldiers while forgoing their own needs. When one of them gets free time, she savors it, standing in the rain and tasting raindrops\u2014admitting she would never have done so before the war. They recognize the simple comforts that they had taken for granted before the war. I picked this book from the Kindle First releases and am glad I ignored the lesser reviews. I couldn\u2019t put this book down with its excellent flow, characters, plot and ending. If you love historical fiction with poignant true-to-life people and situations, I highly recommend \u201cWives of War\u201d. I\u2019m looking forward to reading more from Soraya Lane."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Manley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29491537-jennifer-manley", "userReview": "Love Loved loved!!!This was a first time reading for me of Ms. Lane and I have to say she blew me away!! Scarlett, Ellie, and Lucy are nurses in WW2 and they are stationed in Normandy and they not only become close friends but they witness the worst part of the damage to soldiers in the field hospitals that they work in. But it's not just the soldiers that received some damage the women do as well just in different ways but,nevertheless they still remain strong for one another.This story had me in its grip from the first page and I give due to the author for this. She did her homework. Held true to alot of what what nurses went through back then. The fear and the sorrow were all too real. The story flows well the writing is beautiful. This book has become one of my top ten favorites now along with it's author. I highly recommend this to any and all. Thank you Soraya M. Lane for sharing this exquisite piece of art. Your talent and heart shines through."}, {"userName": "belva hullp", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68439055-belva-hullp", "userReview": "Kindle; WWII; historical fiction;I found this novel to be very good for what it is; romantic historical fiction.Three young women of different backgrounds decide to join up for the nursing war effort in 1944. Two of them, Ellie and Scarlet, meet in London while waiting for the train to take them to their first training destination. Ellie is an Irish lass. She comes from a working class family & her 3 brothers have all enlisted. She already has some experience in nursing as she worked with her mother, a midwife, from her childhood days. Scarlet, on the other hand, is a debutante who is newly engaged to an enlisted man who is also a child of the affluent.Upon reaching their field hospital in Normandy Ellie & Scarlet meet and become friends with Nurse Lucy from London. Her unit has arrived as part of the Royal Air Force. Lucy wants to study to become a doctor after the war.Within a short time all 3 nurses have love interests but there is much more to the story than romance. The author has researched WWII injuries, burns, amputations and treatments. She has included much of this within the story. I liked how Lane grew her characters and found this book to be an interesting read and it easily held my attention."}, {"userName": "Teresita", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43974266-teresita", "userReview": "It was overall a good book. The characters feel real and the storyline feels plausible which makes It easy to connect to the story. It is a romantic historical fiction. Each chapter is based on a different character which was well done in my opinion because it kept the various threads of the story moving forward. It is a lovely story of the challenges we encounter in life. At the beginning you are cheering and rooting for them to succeed, then you get mildly heartbroken and suffer with them and just want them to make it through. And in the end you just want them to succeed and be happy again. Lot's of emotion in this book, it feels real and you really connect with the characters. I really enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "Dana", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11225432-dana", "userReview": "What an amazing story of three women who during a time of war, selfishly give themselves to the war as nurses. Wives of War follows Lucy, Scarlet and Ellie. What they endure, sacrifice and how they eventually heal from the ravages of war.I know this book is fiction, but I could honestly see how every experience that Lucy, Scarlet and Ellie went through could have actually happened to women of that time.I highly recommend Wives of War and Ms. Lanes other books. Her writing has a way of drawing you in and making feel as if you are part of the story. Well done!"}], "description": "London, 1944.

Nursing is in Ellie\u2019s blood, but her humble background is vastly different from Scarlet\u2019s privileged upbringing. Though Ellie puts on a brave face, she\u2019s just as nervous as Scarlet about what awaits them in France.In Normandy, the two friends soon encounter the seemingly unflappable Lucy. Scarlet and Ellie are in awe of her courage and competence, but the experienced nurse is well aware of the dangers of the job they\u2019ve chosen\u2014and even she is terrified they won\u2019t make it home alive.Pushed to their limits by the brutality of a world at war, Scarlet, Ellie and Lucy will need to rely on each other\u2014and the power of their friendship\u2014to survive.", "title": "Wives of War", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32188536-wives-of-war", "average": 4.07, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1487786348l/32188536.jpg", "reviews": 651, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16483730.Soraya_M_Lane", "name": "Soraya M.
