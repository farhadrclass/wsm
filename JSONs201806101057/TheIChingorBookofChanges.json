I can usually find a sentence or more that resonates with me on that day. The ancients believed that this book was a representation of the voices of spirits. It is thousands of years old. I don't know how to use divination with it, but I feel like it is a reliable friend who always gives good advice pertinant to my situation. My favorite line today is, \"Everything that gives light is dependent on something to which it clings, in order that it may continue to shine\" (119, trigram 30, The Clinging, Fire). This is how I feel about books. Books are the things to which I cling and which allow me to contribute any portion of light to the world (ie. not dwell entirely in despair and darkness)."}, {"userName": "Aimee", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/403442-aimee", "userReview": "I know that in NORMAL circles, it's odd to read an ancient chinese text upon which a non-theistic religion is based. HOWEVER, I am not normal and most of the people I enjoy aren't either. SO, let me say that of all the religious texts I have ever read, there is something fundamentally gorgeous about the foundations of this Taoist book. I find it beautiful, cosmically true and irrefutably WISE in its basic applications. By this I mean that the eight pure three-line gua are hypnotically symbolic of every possibility in life and every course of action which leads that life in wisdom -- not that I would divine a 'fortune-telling' from the single gua cast by rods or yarrow stalks or runes... But you'd have to read the book to understand any of that. What I love about the I-Ching is that it is the truest form of advice: prepare, act, reap consequences, reflect, repeat the cycle. This book speaks to my soul in a way the Bible never has, even though I love the stories in the bible. Maybe because it is a wisdom that is symbolic and personal, not a story about someone else, but a true story about MYSELF. You read it. Let me know what you think!"}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5577283-josh", "userReview": "I find it strange when people quote this book. I've seen multiple philosophers, writers, History Channel documentaries, heck, even Sean Connery in Zardoz quote the I Ching. Don't they realize that the I Ching's advice is directed towards the specific hexagram casted in response to a specific question? Its advice is catered to those who ask it\u2013\u00a0its words cannot be pulled out of context and applied to any life situation willy-nilly! The results could be disastrous! Take these two quotes, as an example:\"It is worthwhile to cross great rivers.\"\"It is not worthwhile to cross great rivers.\"So is it worthwhile to cross great rivers or not? Without casting, who would know! You could choose the former, and cross that great river, and all get dysentery and get swept away! \"Most likely\" safe to cross, huh. Shoulda flipped some coins first, yeah, good ol' Chingy would've told you to take the toll road around it, that way you could've made it to Oregon with some surviving family members."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5879865-mark", "userReview": "At one point in my life while semi-transient, it was necessary to leave a portion of my library behind. So I left a box of books on a corner in Berkeley. My I Ching- the Blofeld translation- was amongst these. Some ten years later, I was browsing a bookstore on Haight St. and found a copy of the I Ching in the dollar discount rack. Opening it to the inside cover revealed a very familiar ink stain- green ink, which I suppose I had spilled on it, back in high school. So what are the odds of anyone finding again the exact same copy of a book long abandoned and given up for dead? \"Don't leave me, don't leave me again!\" it cried. Needless to say, I took it back home & resolved never again to forsake... \"It must have been karma, man.\"I originally got my copy somewhere around 1969, and bought it specifically because it was smaller, more portable, much less expensive, and an easier (\"less thick\") translation than the Wilhelm book. I think in many ways it's a lot better, since Wilhelm's focused on the yarrow-stalk technique (yarrow stalks being not an item one can find at hand nor in your usual downtown suburban Woolworth's)- and Blofeld's gave instructions on how to use coins- any three coins of a similar value would do, but pennies being most common, are easily fished from a pocket and available even in most dire circumstances (the kind you'd like to ask the I Ching how you can get out of!)And of course, the I Ching, once you begin using it & get its idioms, isn't exactly the kind of book you ever \"finish reading...\""}, {"userName": "Erik Graff", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff", "userReview": "The introduction by C.G. Jung was quite helpful in making sense of these ancient \"divination texts\" as reflective tools. So helpful that I tried it several times with the simple coin method and could see what he was getting at. Intellectually, however, the most interesting thing was the suggestion of a radically different sense of time. Emotionally, I had been brought up with the ideology of evolutionary progress while intellectually I subscribed to the notion of time as the essentially neutral schematization of change. Here, in the I Ching, was a formalistic approach to time. In other words, as in astrology or even in Marx's conception of epochs, periods of time have a characteristic entelechy."}, {"userName": "Brian  Fitzgerald", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7050705-brian-fitzgerald", "userReview": "This book has changed my life more than once. It's an old friend now, dog-eared and battered from travels on five continents, a bit salt-stained from time at sea. In the 1980s I created a software version on a floppy disk. In 2014 I upgraded that to an app for iPhone, Kindle, iPad, Android, and Apple Watch.

The I Ching is like Chinese astrology that uses coins instead dates. You throw the coins and get a nugget of wisdom that speaks to your life and its problems. Logic would immediately say this is preposterous and I tend to agree, even now. The only problem with my conclusion is that hundreds of coin throws have shown me the I Ching is anything *but* random.A friend introduced me to the book and how to \"throw the bones.\" At some point I started throwing the coins without his help, and my errors were the first clue that logic alone was unable to comprehend this book. The I Ching is based on a binary gate, a broken or unbroken line, formed in trigrams and hexagrams. It's easy to interpret results the opposite of what they are, reversing a line or the order they are interpreted. So I would ask the book a question and throw a hexagram which vaguely commented on my issue. To double-check my work, I would read the various hexagrams that were opposite or perpendicular to the \"true\" hexagram. It was then I found out that, as vague as the true hexagram was, the other hexagrams didn't comment on my question at all. Many smart people have read the I Ching simply as a book of wisdom. For this purpose I highly recommend it as one of the best works of eastern philosophy available. Like astrology, the I Ching divides life into archetypes, forces that play off of each other in creating the basic human experience. The I Ching philosophy is a model and like any model some people will find it hopelessly vague, but this should never be your excuse for avoiding this kind of writing. The wisdom does not arise from what names the I Ching chooses to throw your experience into, but rather how it divides these experiences and how such archetypes balance off each other. The I Ching focuses on change specifically. In the end, I realized the secret to the I Ching's success was in making it's philosophy personal. I can read Nietzschean philosophy but because I don't personally ascribe to his logic it stands apart from me. Yet in taking my life into account whenever I read the I Ching, it's had a more profound effect on my thinking then all of my favorite philosophers combined. The accuracy of the book becomes irrelevant, the important thing is the thought process through which the I Ching takes you."}, {"userName": "Alva Ware-Bevacqui", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7129969-alva-ware-bevacqui", "userReview": "I have used this little Book of Changes for about 15 years (I'm on my second copy) and it has never, ever, ever steered me wrong (unless I've ignored what it said, which has been far too often). Sure, you may think that throwing three coins in the air six times can't tell you anything, but you'd be surprised at how accurate the I Ching is. I've read other I Ching books and this is by far the most accessible. Written by the head doctor for a major circus (go figure!), it is unpretentios and always, always wise with imagery you can understand. The I Ching is NOT about telling the future (in case you were hoping it was) - it's really about how to live and it fits into any religion or no religion.

I occasionally read it, consult it, when I want a complete and full (and usually quite symbolic and mysterious) reading, for it is the translation closest to the original that I have found. However, I have other translations I use for faster readings or for explanations/explorations into deeper aspects of the figures. My longtime copy of this book has been packed away for several years (long story!), and I have continually thought that it will surface one day. Finally, recently, I realized that it's okay simply to buy another copy! Seeing it on my shelves again is like finding an old friend to reconnect with.I also recommend highly the Introduction in this book, just for good reading, for it is written by Carl Jung, who was a friend of Richard Wilhelm (the translator) and who tells a charming story of his own discovery of the I Ching through Wilhelm's friendship.For English readers, I would guess that this is the \"authentic\" version."}, {"userName": "Emanuela", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4102628-emanuela", "userReview": "Devo rileggermi l'introduzione di C.G.Jung perch\u00e8 Brunella Antomarini in Pensare con l'errore dedica quasi un capitolo a I Ching ed ho bisogno di confrontarle."}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/154717-scott", "userReview": "This is one of my favorite translations of the Yi Jing. There are three books I use most often when I throw the coins: the classic Wilhelm/Baynes translation, this one, and Carol Anthony's A Guide to the I Ching. What I like about the Alfred Huang book is that it is very readable and useful, and at the same time feels like it is conveying the nuances of the Chinese meanings better than any other translation I have used. Huang explains in better detail a number of the odd turns of phrase that Wilhelm didn't quite seem to get. He is also more willing than Wilhelm was to let his translation be terse and cryptic when the original text is terse and cryptic -- that's both an advantage and a disadvantage, so I find that the Wilhelm/Baynes and Huang translations complement each other nicely. And then Anthony's commentaries add a layer of interpretation that strongly resonates with me.I have a number of other translations I also like, but these are the three I find I come back to most often for regular use."}, {"userName": "Ben", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8782570-ben", "userReview": "This isn't a book that you sit down a read through (although you can if you want), but more of a tool to use daily/weekly/whenever the needed arises.

Yo llegu\u00e9 a este libro a trav\u00e9s de The Man in the High Castle, donde el protagonista, habitual trasunto del autor, lo usa para tomar las decisiones que le guiar\u00e1n durante la trama. Entonces yo cog\u00ed este libro, cog\u00ed el otro e iba leyendo los pasajes correspondientes a ver si entend\u00eda bien lo que estaba pasando, pero se hac\u00eda jorobadamente costoso por dos razones: ni nosotros pensamos como Philip K. Dick, ni los antiguos est\u00e1s m\u00e1s cercanos en sus procesos mentales de lo que estamos nosotros de los de los Anunnaki.Porque es verdad: los antiguos orientales resultan tan herm\u00e9ticos al occidental actual como un alien\u00edgena ancestral. Me siento incapaz de entender sus procesos lo suficiente como para comprender por qu\u00e9 el hecho de que un monos\u00edlabo signifique una cosa o un signo se escriba de cierta manera implica metaf\u00f3ricamente que el desenlace de ese momento vital por el que preguntas se encamine hacia un lado y no hacia el otro. Supongo que es como el hor\u00f3scopo, que es tan generalista que se adapta a todos los que lo leen, aunque en realidad esta es solo una burda comparaci\u00f3n teniendo en cuenta que este m\u00e9todo es de los m\u00e1s antiguos que se conocen en la Humanidad.Por eso considero que, salvo que seas un estudioso de estas lides, el valor real que se queda en el cerebro del que lo lea es el de saber que la vida en otros tiempos y otras culturas era tan diferente a la nuestra que no podemos hacer traslaciones directas de nuestros pensamientos y actuaciones a esas \u00e9pocas porque est\u00e1 fuera de contexto. Y eso por no hablar de la Antropolog\u00eda, la Sociolog\u00eda... En fin, que me estoy yendo del tema: que el libro bien, que resulta muy interesante como contraste cultural y m\u00ednimo aprendizaje del idioma, pero que entenderlo es harina de otro costal que dejo a los acad\u00e9micos m\u00e1s eruditos.

It is both a compendium of ancient knowledge that is still perfectly applicable to contemporary situations, and an oracle that clearly defines any situation and points to the correct action (or non-action) required to resolve the situation in the most effective manner. I have used the oracle on and off for nearly 50 years and it has never led me astray. A good deal of immersion / meditation / intuition is required to understand the book's description of the players in any given situation, and to (as I think of it) lay the book's \"template\" over the situation to \"decode\" it, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature. The book was first translated in the early 20th century from the original Chinese into German by Richard Wilhelm, and then from German into English in the late 1940s by Cary F. Baynes. There is a wonderful Foreword written by Carl Jung, who used the German version of the oracle to cast light on events in his own life.

I haven't spent enough time with it to be able to recommend it but i suspect most people would find the sort of input that the I Ching can offer to be helpful in a wide variety of situations."}, {"userName": "Saman Kashi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/273273-saman-kashi", "userReview": "\u064a\u064a\u200c\u0686\u064a\u0646\u06af \u064a\u0627 (\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062a\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0631\u0627\u062a) \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0633 \u0686\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0643\u0647\u0646\u200c\u062a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u062a\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u062c\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0686\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646. \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0633 \u0643\u0647 \u0628\u064a\u0634 \u0627\u0632 \u0686\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0647\u0632\u0627\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u0642\u062f\u0645\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f\u060c \u0627\u0632 \u0622\u064a\u064a\u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a \u0627\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0647\u200c\u064a \u0686\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0634\u0623\u062a \u06af\u0631\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0627\u0632 \u0634\u0635\u062a \u0648 \u0686\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062a \u0648 \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0645 \u062a\u0634\u0643\u064a\u0644 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u0627\u062f \u0686\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645 \u0628\u0631 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0647 \u0643\u0647 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u062a\u062d\u0648\u0644\u0627\u062a\u064a \u0643\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u062f\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0648 \u0628\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0622\u062f\u0645\u064a \u0631\u062e \u0645\u064a\u200c\u062f\u0647\u062f\u060c \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0634\u0635\u062a \u0648 \u0686\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062a \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0647 \u0645\u064a\u200c\u0634\u0648\u062f"}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2177898-paul", "userReview": "If you are looking for a beginners book on the I Ching that is easy to understand and easy to use then this book is for you.I use it almost daily and it never fails to offer good advice."}, {"userName": "Wesley Jackson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44137775-wesley-jackson", "userReview": "6 in the fourth position.Bones are scattered.A heavy tome is regarded.The solemn reader is rewarded.No blame."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6725494-mark", "userReview": "Classic Confucius.

It has exerted a living influence in China for 3000 years and interest in it has spread in the West. Set down in the dawn of history as a book of oracles, the Book of Changes deepened in meaning when ethical values were attached to the oracular pronouncements; it became a book of wisdom, eventually one of the Five Classics of Confucianism, and provided the common source for both Confucianist and Taoist philosophy. Wilhelm's rendering of the I Ching into German, published in 1924, presented it for the 1st time in a form intelligible to the general reader. Wilhelm, who translated many other ancient Chinese works and who wrote several books on Chinese philosophy and civilization, long resided in China. His close association with its cultural leaders gave him a unique understanding of the text of the I Ching. In the English translation, every effort has been made to preserve Wilhelm's pioneering insight into the spirit of the original.This 3rd edition, completely reset, contains a new forward by Hellmut Wilhelm, one of the most eminent American scholars of Chinese culture. He discusses his father's textual methods and summarizes recent studies of the I Ching both in the West and in present-day China. The new edition contains minor textual corrections, bibliographical revisions and an index.", "title": "The I Ching or Book of Changes", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/534289.The_I_Ching_or_Book_of_Changes", "average": 4.18, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1406503668l/534289.jpg", "reviews": 303, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5158478.Anonymous", "name": "Anonymous"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/33495.Richard_Wilhelm", "name": "Richard Wilhelm"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19277.Cary_F_Baynes", "name": "Cary F.
