Unfortunately, Dewey ends up dead at their \"end-of-business\" party (at least he died at the right themed party!). Lalla ends up taking care of Nancy, Dewey's widow, and brings her to her home because she feels Nancy might also be in danger. Of course Lalla's suspicions turn out to be founded, but there's no way a tiny little thing like her wedding is going to stop Lalla from snooping and figuring out who killed Dewey and why!I'm so happy that Lalla Bains is back! This was my favourite book of the three and it's all there: crime, mystery, suspense and great characters! I really liked the glimpses into Lalla's thoughts as she goes back and forth with new theories. Her dad completely lost in a house full of women as Lalla's great-aunt and her cousin (Pearlie) come from Texas for her wedding is hilarious. Nancy is a great character because you won't be able to decide if she is one of the good guys or one of the bad ones. Nevertheless, the best new character is hidden under cousin Pearlie who starts out as a spoiled rich woman but who keeps growing on you, believe me. It's also endearing to finally meet the woman behind Lalla's name and finding out how much they have in common. You'll like this story, it has the right twists, the right amount of corpses, one bride and at least one goat! (Which according to the author has not been harmed in the making of the book)."}, {"userName": "R.P.

I have no affiliation with the author or publisher and have not received payment for my review.**A Dead Red Oleander starts off with a bang. Why is this woman \u2013 Lalla - handcuffed beneath a truck? What did she do? Who left her there? Is someone coming back to finish her off? The prologue did an excellent job of drawing the reader in wanting to read more. Chapter one begins stating \"6 weeks earlier\". Lalla hires a temporary pilot for her crop dusting business that she and her father are in the process of shutting down at the end of the season in a few weeks. Dewey Treat comes well recommended and she gives him the job. Unfortunately he drops dead at a BBQ Lalla and her father are hosting at their ranch. Due to the suspicious nature of his death the police arrest his wife Nancy. Lalla is convinced her new friend has been set up and starts an investigation to find the real killer, who leaves a few more bodies in his wake before he is finally captured.A Dead Red Oleander was well written, good plot, good dialogue, fast moving story line, well developed, likeable characters, the kind of book that is a real page turner. I liked the book and I would recommend it to others to read.Unfortunately this wonderful book was a victim of formatting and editing errors. Punctuation errors, words spelled correctly that would not be caught in a computer spell check but used incorrectly, and extra words that messed up sentences - He was a really was a fast learner. I also had my doubts that 6 weeks passed between the prologue and first chapter. The book moved along really quickly with no explained time lapses. It seemed like only a few days passed between chapter one and the handcuffed under the truck scene. I won\u2019t use the editing as an excuse to give a snarky review or lowball rating the novel because I really did like this book. I was able to get past the sloppy editing to enjoy the well written story but I want to be honest in my review and give potential readers a heads up because not everyone wants to read a book with errors in each chapter. I was tempted to give a 5 star review but I don't think it would be fair to potential readers who are expecting a good, clean copy. I definitely recommend A Dead Red Oleander for people who love fast moving cozy mysteries.But I don't recommend it for readers who get really bugged by sloppy editing!Will Lalla ever get married? I have to know! I definitely will be reading more of this author's books."}, {"userName": "Wordsmith", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7584724-wordsmith", "userReview": "R.P.

My dad, Caleb, Roxanne and half of Stanislaus County will be pleased to hear that promise come true. I will, this time.

Shooting words\u2014not meant to kill.Hook's alone don't guarantee that sustaining, ever-lasting love, not even for a lovely and gutsy sleuther, such as Lalla is. Here's the deal: She's not out seeking some kind a thrill, she's a lover, hey, lets keep it real.Lalla Baine's is one tall, blonde, drink of cool water, having been THAT former NYC top-model.\u00a0She's came home to California, took to dusting\u2014flying, getting nose all deep in 'er beau's business.

P. Dahkle has, double or tripling THAT deal. Lalla's not only got her days full, dusting down the verminous weevils, planning a wedding, loving her honey and appeasing her batty, extended family, they being gun-toting, lip licking gals, who think nothing of serving, with tasty chipolte dip, straight off the grill, Lalla's Dad's pet goat Bruce. All the while ducking hails of crossfire, trips to lowly bars with lower patrons and dealing with murderous folk not very wary of the lovely Lalla. Their bad. R. P. gets you going from the get-go. She's got you cruising thru layers of (mass\u2014most times) confusion served up right (well and good) by that classic ole stand-by, the crafty red herrings not to mention her clever use in spewing out so many miscues, which serve only to skew ones perception to that of one brimming with multitudes of misconceptions. Yep, you keep on cruising right down to that final page. Sad, closing a good book. I've really only just gotten warm, but yes, she deals, she deals in spades, in the utter scribiliciousness of alla it. She, R. P. is fluent in it. Lalla, like her creator, is coming into her own.\u00a0Lalla's could be hero, the dutiful, do anything to catch 'em, Reacher? Has he crossed your radar? He being that former M. P. whose rather like Lalla, feeling that calling binded with honor. He too, like Lalla, knows the pits to peaks of being taller. Wall flower to power. So, just how does Reacher from nowhere \u00a0fit with sunny Calfornian Lalla? Simply cuz no sleuther has said any better. \"You do not mess with the special investigators.\" Ain't no body the same kinda special as Lalla and R. P. Dahlke, the sleuther and the scribe. What A Team. I was sent a pre-lease of A Dead Red Oleander by the author. It did not cloud my judgement.And, no silly! Bruce never got grilled!

The author has created a wonderful crime/mystery that will make readers laugh. I know I did several times while reading this book.The characters Lalla Bains and her fianc\u00e9 Caleb are at it again. Lalla is trying to end the season of crop dusting in the black and the business will be sold. Caleb is just trying to keep Lalla out of trouble. It seems like Lalla always has trouble following her around is always in trouble. If she is not trying to solve a mystery she is getting chased on the highway. Then her family is a little nuts so maybe Lalla just keeps the trouble around so nothing ever get boring.Even though this is the third book in the series it can be read as a stand-alone. I have not read the other books in the series, however, I will read them now. The writing style of R.P. Dahlke is fresh with a witty spark that leaves the reader wondering where this author has been hiding.In this book Lalla's extended family members arrive to help get everything ready for the wedding. However, trouble jump up and Lalla has to solve the problems while still trying to get everything ready.I live on a farm. We have never used a crop-duster before so I do not know much about this. However, as much as I love the beautiful Oleander flower, I do not have them in my yard due to them being poisonous.If you are looking for a crime/mystery to read this week then check out this book. However this is a great weekend read. This book is under 200 pages. So if you are a fast reader then you could probably finish this in about 1 day.Thanks for an amazing read R.P.The Bunnies and I give this book 5 carrots.I was gifted by book by the author for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Lesley Diehl", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3419764-lesley-diehl", "userReview": "Lalla Bains is back, and this time she\u2019s not alone. Her nuptials only days away, and the newest pilot for the crop dusting company dies at a prewedding party. The authorities arrest the man\u2019s wife. Lalla insists the wife is not guilty, but her fianc\u00e9 Caleb is not so sure and warns her not to meddle in the case. We know that would be impossible for Lalla. She\u2019s off to track down the real killer accompanied by her cousin Pearlie, a little pistol-packin\u2019 Texas gal who is often more of a hindrance than a help.The reader can\u2019t help but be hooked by the opening pages\u2014Lalla handcuffed to the bottom of a truck in the middle of a field in 100 degree heat, and there\u2019s no let-up in action when the reader turns the page to find out how she got there. The characters are sympathetic, the kind of folks you\u2019d want as next door neighbors. The cousin and aunt provide Lalla with the fire power and the laughs necessary to keep this story moving at the speed of a bullet. Caleb might be disgusted at Lalla\u2019s snooping, but while she fears he might dump her before the wedding, we know he will not. Her conflict between wanting to please Caleb and her need to discover the killer is basic Lalla. We expect nothing less than for her to put herself into difficult spots, and then get out of them. It\u2019s part of what moves the story along and makes Lalla the kind of gal we want to pair up with. Pearlie proves to be just the right buddy in sleuthing for Lalla, and we hope to see more of her in the future. With the crop dusting business about to be sold, the reader looks forward to what tricky situations Ms. Dahlke will present to her able sleuth in the next Dead Red installment. But I really hate to wait! I gave it five stars and a planet.Lesley A.

What a wonderful read this was. If you are going to the beach, the pool or even just staying home and avoiding the heat, this is a great read for you. Both my husband and I loved A Dead Red Oleander although I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is my favorite in the series. That would be tantamount to having a favorite child - just wrong. Each book stands alone and I really appreciate Rebecca Dahlke's skill in introducing you to the characters in every book without boring those of us who have followed them from the first. That takes a deft touch. Lalla Bains is a hoot, gorgeous, crazy as heck, a woman that can manage well in the world of modeling or in a man's world of crop dusting. I hope that lots of return readers caught that Lalla shares not only her real name with her aunt Eula Mae but also a huge heart and an outrageous character. I love Lalla's now steady relationship with Caleb and watching her curmudgeon of a father starting to demonstrate his love for his daughter... though walking his pet Bruce the goat would be really weird in any family but the Bains's! The addition of her zany cousin Pearlie to the cast was wonderful and I believe that we may be seeing a lot more of her in the future. Of course, there is a murder, some unofficial investigation by Lalla and Pearlie and plenty of twists and turns to keep you moving through the book without thinking about putting it down. As usual, another Bains bash!

Waking up to find herself handcuffed to the bumper of a truck out in the middle of nowhere is only the beginning \u2013 or is it the end? The new pilot she\u2019s hired for the crop dusting business is murdered during an end-of-the-season party at Lalla\u2019s home, and his wife, Nancy, is the chief suspect. Murder by oleander \u2013 not a new concept, but different in this case. Think barbequed oleander. Lalla knows in her heart that Nancy is innocent and she risks everything to prove it, including her relationship with her intended, Caleb.From eccentric Texas relatives who\u2019ve come to help prepare for Lalla\u2019s wedding, to a father who treats a goat like a pet dog, this story will grab you and it won\u2019t let go. The characters are memorable and enjoyable, and the story is pure fun. I\u2019m hoping Aunt Mae and cousin Pearlie will reappear in future books. I think, and hope, it\u2019s possible.I highly recommend this book to mystery lovers and anyone who wants to be entertained.

It's not great literature, but I found it diverting, and after some very busy days traveling, a relaxing indulgence. It's clearly aimed at a female audience, but as a guy reading it, I actually found the way the author reveals strategies women use against each other when competing for a man's attention to be instructive as well as amusing."}, {"userName": "Kellie ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5146537-kellie", "userReview": "Lalla Bains is back in this third book of the Lalla Bains mystery series.

Solving the murder is not easy. Twists and turns keep you guessing. In this third book of the series we meet Lalla's Aunt Mae and Cousin Perlie from Texas. Do they help or hinder the investigation?

After all, he comes highly recommended, his physical is spotless, and with a name by Dewey Treat, what could possibly go wrong? Then her quirky relatives arrive from Texas and things go south in a hurry: Dewey Treat drops dead, his tearful widow claims he was murdered, clobbers Sherriff Caleb Stone with his own gun, and makes a run for it. Lalla, convinced the widow is innocent, sets out to prove it\u2014against the express wishes of fianc\u00e9 Caleb Stone. Feds, local law, suspicious ag-pilots, nutso relatives, and her daddy's new sidekick, Bruce the goat, make life a living hell for Lalla. Will her nosey nature solve the crime and save the day? Or put them all in mortal danger?", "title": "A Dead Red Oleander\n      \n          (A Dead Red #3)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15702508-a-dead-red-oleander", "average": 3.78, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1339523827l/15702508.jpg", "reviews": 160, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4714290.R_P_Dahlke", "name": "R.P.
