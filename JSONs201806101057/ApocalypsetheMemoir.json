OliverI am sad to say this book somehow got swept up into my house and disappeared for a while. I remember writing it down on my \"to read\" list and then being unable to find it. I went through all of my book shelves (there are many) and was annoyed and confused on where it could have gone. I gave up the search until I did a little spring cleaning and found it deep under a couch that didn't seem like anything could have fit under it. Interestingly enough, I decided it was still in beautiful working condition and that my cats must have stolen it. So, many many reads later - here it is! My review of a book I've been dying to read for far to long.This story centers around Indy, our 15 year old narrator who seems to be in a zombie apocalypse in Canada. It's a humorous take on what seems to be a very common story now, but this book is unique. This book not only has crazy zombies, but a funny narrator, sassy side characters and an interesting back story. This novel is brutal and definitely R-rated, but it's fantastic in a sort of Deadpool way. While you're cringing at the blood and gore, you're laughing along with Indy's thoughts and descriptions. The zombies aren't exactly your typical slow moving, \"let me eat your brains\" zombies - they are nasty, predatory creatures that give you a movie-monster-esque vibe. I liked that aspect - slow moving zombies always seem kind of boring to me. Bonus Points: Canadian cities (I'm a Canadian, what can I say?).\"Are hot dogs miracles?\" If that line doesn't explain the whole book, I don't know what does. Reading from the view of a 15 year old narrator, I can definitely say that thought is accurate. I am almost certain at that age that sort of thought would be randomly popping into my head. This entire book seemed to be written with my sense of humour in mind. I don't see all readers understanding it, but as I read along I couldn't help but chuckle. I rarely find books funny, but I related with Indy, our main character, far to much. I really enjoyed her spunky thoughts and I wish more novels had narrators like her - different, odd and absolutely hilarious.There were two \"downfalls\" to me for this book:The biggest downfall of this book was that the conversations in this novel did not have quotation marks around them. That was probably the worst part of this novel - the story was fantastic, the humor was on point, but the lack of quotation marks threw me off a bit. To someone like me, it's slightly annoying. To most readers? Probably not something that would turn them away from the book.The second downfall or question I have - was this book all a metaphor? The first half of the book seems like an epic, film ready novel for a zombie dystopia/apocalypse. The second half seemed so interesting and more like a 1984 novel ready to be dissolved and taken apart in an English class. I loved seeing these two kind of smashed together into one book, but it gave me far to many questions. I want to march up to CS Oliver and ask so many questions... But maybe that's a good thing. Overall, this book is deemed worthy by me. I definitely want to read more by CS Oliver and I hope any more books created by CS are just as sassy and thrilling!Four out of five stars.I received this book for free through Goodreads First Reads."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7087508-jennifer", "userReview": "[ Keith died.

After the halfway point, it began to sink to just below three stars. So a more realistic average is 3.5 stars.Oliver immediately demonstrates she can wield metaphor like a pro, all while building a world where even though in the back of your mind you suspect that a real and personal human pain is being discussed, you can tamp that suspicion down in your subconscious and enjoy the fun apocalyptic action.As the book hums along, the metaphor begins to overtake the story, until the ending is a fairly solid WTF just happened?!? I'm a sucker for metaphor, and as my experience with Prunty's Fuckness shows, I don't necessarily need to know what just happened, but in Apocalypse the Memoir, somehow the promise to the reader made in the beginning feels a little more forgotten by the end.I gobbled this up in one sitting and I'll be keeping an eye out for more C.S. Oliver, and hope one day to find a goodread's book discussion on Memoir so I can address what was so important about the color Mustard Yellow, among other questions."}, {"userName": "A.C.

So, when I pick one up, I want it to offer a new slant on the destruction of the world and its rebirth as a walking meat market. Apocalypse: The Memoir does exactly that. The zombies are not predictable, lumbering Walking Dead-style chunks of meat, but instead deadly, predatory creatures that are affectionately referred to as crayfish-zombies. Like every great story, there's a journey. This one sees the central character, Indy, making the perilous trip from her native Canada to the once-glitzy Las Vegas in search of her father. It's then that you realise that this is as much a story about a girl coming of age as it is about the apocalyptic nightmare she finds herself in. The narrative is intelligent, sometimes amusing, but above all, compelling with tasty morsels of gratifying horror. So, grab your shellmet (it will all make sense when you start to read!) and join Indy on the road to survival."}, {"userName": "TT", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39456865-tt", "userReview": "Oliver tells some truths I didn't think could be told. Anyone who grew up a weirdo girl in a small town will understand the way this book pits quiet rural desperation against striving and greatness. A fantastic horror story, a fantastic road trip story, at times a fantastically violent story (trigger warning: sexual assault pp. 122-127! skippable), but most of all a sensitive tale of being an outsider teenager who finds her feet. (And her truck. And her diving knife. And her maul.) In other words, it is\u2014with fewer arthropods involved\u2014a story I deeply identify with.

Without going into too much detail, Indy lives with her uncaring mother and dead-beat stoner step-dad. One day, everyone is dead and start to return as zombies. Here is the first twist that I really liked - all of the zombies are armoured with a kind of hard, shell-fish like carapace, which makes them a little harder to kill. On top of that, it's not just the people that are affected. For the first time that I know, all living creatures have come back as undead, armoured killers - insects, animals, fish, you name it - and they all have their own little ways of killing or maiming. The horror elements of this book are great fun.There is also a bit of a twist at the end of the book which I didn't see coming, but still left me a little wanting for a more cut-and-dry end, but the rest of the book did make up for it, and it was a good, fun read overall.Now I need to put my editor's hat on (sorry, I can't help it). The main reasons this book did not achieve 5 stars is the formatting and editing. It could have used a final proofread to tidy it up a little. The book seems to be formatted for e-book reading (I have a paperback version) - paragraphs are in block format instead of indented paragraphs. Also, speech is not within speech marks, but in a block of their own. I think C.S. has done this intentionally as there are no 'he said' 'she said' dialogue tags in the writing, so after a few pages, you do get used to the style, but it does make for a bit of awkwardness through certain parts of the book.Those things said, I can recommend this book to anyone who likes zombie stories, horror and quick, fun reads. Get yourself a copy if you can."}, {"userName": "Papaphilly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30045612-papaphilly", "userReview": "I enjoyed this read. It is a first novel from a female writer that shows promise. C.S. Oliver calls Apocalypse the Memoir the first of three and the first is a memoir. However, it is not a traditional memoir in that there are no dates or set up like a diary. The protagonist is an abused young lady trailer raised in a terrible situation, yet somehow makes her way in a world that has gone sideways. This is not a true zombie novel either, but something a bit different, which is good. The novel only hints at what is happening and why. As I noted, Apocalypse the Memoir shows promise, but has a few issues. It is well written, but as with most first novels there are rough patches. I found some of the dialogue hard to follow and had to reread some of it more than once. It is a bit awkward to follow. Nothing terrible, just a bit annoying. I also wish some of the characters were a bit developed better, but once again nothing deadly. The novel is set up like a road story, but does not quite pull it off, a few more anecdotes along the way would have filled the story out nicely.With all of that said, it is an enjoyable read and I had a hard time putting it down. It is nice reading a flawed character that is not kicking down doors and taking on the world. The protagonist reads as very human. She survives not only from pure luck, but also her world was such a mess, this was one more on that table to deal with and she is able to handle the situation. There is a nice flow to the story and it hold your interest throughout. A nice first novel worth checking out."}, {"userName": "J.

Punchy, fun, and gives a lot of food for thought. Impossible to put down, read it pretty much in one shot! Very glad that I picked this up! Zombies? Yes, but be prepared for a surprise!"}, {"userName": "P.T.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2241304-p-t", "userReview": "The cover, title, and description don't tell you much about what to expect here. But I'll make one thing clear: even if you ignore the \"memoir\" part, it's an amazing post-apocalypse novel. There may be true story elements, but they are felt more than seen. The less said about the details the better, because part of the joy of this trip is discovering all the ways in which it veers off the road of traditional post-apocalyptic zombie horror.The writing is crisp and fast-paced, giving just enough detail for your brain to fill in the horrible details. The lack of quotation marks in dialogue is sometimes distracting, but goes with the dreamy feel and minimalism of the writing, I guess. Humour, horror, and heart-break are injected into every paragraph in equal measure, so your emotions can never stay in one place for too long.And the ending! Not everyone will like it, but everyone will feel something about it. That's my kind of ending.Apocalypse the Memoir will make you laugh and make you angry and make you barf.
