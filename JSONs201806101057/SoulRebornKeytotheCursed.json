This book had elements that would satisfy not only fans of paranormal romance but also urban fantasy fans as it combined Egyptian Gods and Goddesses, the walking dead, betrayal, and the world at peril against the backdrop of a hot and passionate romance.The premise of the book is that a strange plague has infected the world that has turned humans into the walking dead who crave the hot blood of humans. The only defense the humans have against these walking dead is a league of Nehebkau huntresses who made it their goal to eradicate them from the world especially for Lilly. Until that point in time that was her the only thing that was important to her until her encounter with a strange, powerful creature who turned her existence upside down. The moment she meets Asar she finds herself drawn to him and vice versa. Who wouldn't be drawn to the God of the Underworld who not only radiates power, but seduction with his gorgeous, muscular physique, shoulder length blackhair and dark piercing eyes.Asar has his own curse that he has had to endure that has left him with only hate and revenge to fuel him until he meets Lilly. There is something about her that tames and soothes him that he cannot explain since he has no soul to soothe. Yet the more time he spends with Lilly the more he finds himself opening doors within himself that he thought were shut closed for eternity.The building sexual tension between the two of them grows so intense that when they do get together they sizzle off the pages. All I can say is Asar really knows how to rock a woman's world, literally, and the way he is described and what he does will make you wish you had him for yourself.The other thing I want to mention is the author not only did an marvelous job of writing passionate scenes that were so hot that you wanted to put the book down to find your significant other at that very moment, but also writing such strong emotional scenes that you felt your heart ache with pain and sorrow.The secondary character were also so amazing. They didn't appear as filler as some do in other books, but were so well fleshed out that you wanted to know more about them. At some points they provided some wonderful light comic relief within the story with the main characters.This is a must read that will satisfy readers who want not only a hot, passionate romance but also action that will keep you glued to the pages and wanting to know what is going to happen next. I was extremely impressed at how much action did occur in this book and what makes me want to read book 2 is it ends with a cliffhanger.As soon as Book 2 is out I plan to get my copy and savor getting reacquainted with everyone and continuing where the story left off and finding out what is going to happen next with these wonderful characters.5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Elena R a.k.a.

This novel was quick paced and engaging. Who would've known one story could carry so much depth. The paranormal aspect of the story was over the top A.M.A.Z.I.N.G! The characters have strong loyal connections to one another. (Which I find really important in a story.) That being said. This book had me in control,whenever I set the book down, my thoughts were running about \"what's going to happen next\". The 3 Carrigan sisters are in for a wild ride they never expected. As humans,they were brought up to be Huntresses. As their story progresses, their involvement with the Demi-Gods play a huge role.The Demi-Gods, claim the humans are responsible for unleashing the curse when they unearthed a tomb and released a violent goddess from her prison. Both the Hero and Heroine were complete opposites, Lilly being a human (who despises any supernatural being) and Asar being a Demi-God (who hates humans) Clashed in all the right ways. Who were they fooling? Not me! Ha! They were two stubborn souls,but a match well made. I loved their connection. Asar is a sexy Alpha Hero and Lily is a kick-a** Heroine, just how I like my characters.When all is said and done. There's a story behind every story. Like I've already mentioned,a load gets thrown at you left and right. I honestly don't think I had the time to breath. Lol! It was just that good! I can't wait for the next novels to be released. I'm crossing my fingers that there will be 2 more stories,with these wicked sisters. Lily had her HEA, now Kit and Kendra need one. I can't wait to see which Demi-God they make quiver and bring to their knees with love for them. I'm excited!

I love all things paranormal, I just can't help myself. But I'm a history buff, it used to be my major. I was that kid who dreamed of being an Egyptologist, and I'll let my nerd colors shine through by admit my love for Stargate because of so much of the Egypt mythology being used in it. So when I opened this book and really jumped into I feel in love with the who love of all things Egypt all over again. I will say one thing I really like is how Murray brings the Gods and Goddess into a modern time, and modern setting. I like that she acknowledges the past with its history and how it has fallen by the wayside. I also really like that she chose the main God in the story to be from the Underworld. Most people are fascinated with with all the other various Gods, and the term \"underworld\" just screams the makings of a villan, but Asar is so not a villan. He's a great character and it's really easy to follow his journey and really like him. Although, I have to admit when his character was introduced I wasn't sure what to think of him, although I'm pretty sure that was the point. I love Lilly, she is really a great character. Anyone who has a good older sibling, or is a good older sibling can probably relate to her. She is a strong protector of her family, and carries a lot of burdens, a lot of which should not be carried by her. I think part of the reason why I like her so much is often time when you have a character that is so centered on protecting others, they don't really get a chance to fall in love, or rather it takes so long for them to get around to letting their guard down, and then as a reader I only get a few chapters of you know happy ending stuff. Sure she runs into problems in her new romance, but every relationship has issues, it makes her seem more real and more likable. There were a lot of secondary characters in the book (seriously think there should be a novella devoted to Bomani, like an origin story, cause that would be awesome). Regardless there are a lot of secondary characters and each of them are pretty distinct in their own right, which I think is hard to accomplish given the amount their are of them. But they each stand on their own really well. And the villans of the story are really good. Kepi is villan you are aware of really early on in the book, imagine a mean girl, with powers, a serious God complex, and out for revenge; needless to say she keeps things interesting. By the time you are done with the book you know there is more going on than everyone is aware of, so it should be fun reading the next book and discovering more of what was going on behind the scenes. Overall the book was really good and I loved it. I will say it's a long read. I don't know why, I'm a pretty quick reader, but this book took me longer than average to get through. That's not a bad thing though, since it kept my attention the entire time, and the pacing was really spot on. I think anyone would really enjoy this book, maybe even people who aren't necessarily fans of paranormal/fantasy but like history. Either way I would give this book a read, oh and if you are looking for romance, this book has it pleasantly placed throughout. It also has a lot of action and adventure!"}, {"userName": "Shannon Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22004916-shannon-robinson", "userReview": "Holy Freaking crap!!! This book is awesome beyond awesome. One of my favorite things is Greek mythology so when I was gifted this book I was willing to ty a different cultures mythology. Let\u2019s just say I was not disappointed in Egyptian culture. This book has family, love, war, and major obstacles that need to be overcome. Lilly is a warrior who fights against the plague on earth that has made revens. With the help of her sisters Kendra and Kit, they try to in a cure and keep the uninfected safe. Two of the sisters kick serious butt with their huntress skills while the bookworm helps piece together the mysteries. While fighting evil Lilly never thought that she would find something even more evil but with a deep connection to her. Asar is the Lord of the underworld and has been cursed by his ex. These two find attraction among each other with the powers that be having a greater plan for them. This book is now part of my fave books category and will be waiting for the next great work."}, {"userName": "Amy Turner", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/209216-amy-turner", "userReview": "I'll be totally honest. Reading the brief description of the back of this book didn't really sell me on it. I wasn't really sure if I would like it.Jean Murray's rich world and equally rich but real characters completely blew me away. She has not only crafted a vivid and easy to imagine world, but the characters who inhabit it are believable. I found myself rooting for both Asar and Lilly - and yelling at them for poor choices, too. Asar was a fascinating character who, despite having lost his soul, was still very complex and deep. Lilly was a wonderful heroine with her own hidden wounds, strong but gentle.The pace was excellent, not too fast nor too slow, and I couldn't put the book down. I read it in one sitting. Her very clever intertwining of the real world and Egyptian mythology made this a unique and wonderful read. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good adventure or romance (or both)."}, {"userName": "Lillie Roberts", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2181146-lillie-roberts", "userReview": "Lilly has had her hands full since the death of her father, and Mother holds his life and death over her head. Lilly holds herself responsible for a lot of things, including the well being of her two younger sisters, Kit and Kendra. Lilly is the leader of the Nehebkau huntresses, only occasionally challenged by Rebecca, the commander of the para-fighters. With Kit at her back, Lilly lets the power of Nehebkau flow through her body, to destroy the hordes of undead plaguing their world, their home. This undead plague seems to be infecting more and more of humanity, until the city officials have to depend on the huntresses to keep the hordes in check. Kendra, museum mistress and the brains behind their efforts as well as being the youngest sister, keeps them on track, searching to discover the answer to the undead plague... one Lilly feels has been unleashed by her own hand.Asar first sees Lilly as he seeks out the human souls he needs to nourish his depleted soulless body. She appears as the beautiful blonde unwilling to bow to his demands or desires. His body has been left soulless by a jilted goddess, one he found lacking, one he couldn't allow to have entrance to the Underworld, and entombed. As revenge, when she was accidentally released, she strips away his heart, and with it, his soul, as well as any of the human souls she can enslave. He and his brother, Kamen, are unaffected by the soulless undead, even to the point of having control over them if only temporarily. When Lilly and Asar finally meet on equal terms, sparks ignite, and what Asar thought was lost forever is returned with Lilly's every touch. It's an addiction only she can cure, and he must endure, if his soul is to be reborn.Soul Reborn by Jean Murray is a sweet ride into Ms. Murray interpretation of Egyptian mythos. She builds her world to include a different existence on the Earthbound plane, one where Egyptian myths are brought into reality. And with that reality, comes the existences of Gods and Goddess, some good, and some, not so much. A great battle is building between the forces of good and evil, the only question is will Lilly and Asar be able to withstand the coming conflict? Will this new love they've discovered by strong enough to fight the evil that has been brought into reality? Are Asar and Lilly willing to forgive each other for what they see as their crimes against humanity?Soul Reborn is an excellent addition to the growing genre of stories revolving around the mythology of Egyptian, Roman, and Greek Gods. The heroine of the story, Lilly, provides the strong resilient, but at the same time, very feminine leader. Asar, our hero, is the alpha male I've come to love, strong yet needy, a soft core only Lilly fill to complete his existence. Because, with the loss of his heart and soul, he'll need to learn to love, if he's going to live to fight another day. Each will have to see how far they're willing to go to be together. I highly recommend this book to lovers of stories revolving around mythos, as well as paranormal romance lovers. Urban fantasy lovers will also fall in love with this story because at it's core, there is the creation of the world filled with scores of the undead, willing to dine on humanity. Soul Reborn, Key to the Cursed, Book 1 is Lilly and Asar's story, with Kit and Kendra's stories yet to come. I'll be eagerly waiting to see where this story leads next. Five out of five fairy kisses."}, {"userName": "Maghon Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3382002-maghon-thomas", "userReview": "I seriously love the mythology here! I wasn\u2019t quite sure what I was expecting when I opted to read this series, but the blurb sounded so interesting and it\u2019s definitely worth the read! For you mythology and suspense junkies- this is REALLY the perfect story! I\u2019ll definitely say this is a fast paced, well versed, and will suck you right in from the beginning. I promise you\u2019ll use every excuse to not put it down. And I love that each of the sisters have such independent and different personalities. And there\u2019s something special about each!I really liked Lilly. She is strong, she\u2019s Indepentent, she\u2019s very set on her \u201csupernatural hating\u201d beliefs. She\u2019s also fiercely loyal and protective of her family. She seems to have the weight of the world on her. I think that because of her personality and morals with this, it makes her such a relatable character. When you\u2019re worried about everyone else, when do you have time to worry about herself!I love that Asar is \u201cthe bad guy from the Underworld\u201d, except that he isn\u2019t. You start out thinking he is because he hates humans and his attitude, but in the end, I totally get why Lilly fell for him! He\u2019s quite a catch LOL! And you know I\u2019m all about the side kicks! There\u2019s some really great secondary characters that have some great roles! I\u2019m definitely looking forward to more of them too!Let me also just say that the \u201cbad guy\u201d is scary, not because of the normal reasons but because of the realistic personality! It\u2019s like mean girls meets die hard meets the craft\u2026 Ok maybe that\u2019s not exactly it, but it\u2019s what keeps popping in my head hahaha the writing is awesome and it\u2019s a little longer than most, but I actually liked that because nothing felt rushed, even if the pace was fast.

Jean Murray is a new author worth taking notice of. Murray does an excellent job of blending action, heat and strong intriguing characters into a well written novel. Soul Reborn is the first in the Key to the Cursed series, a series that will follow three sisters and their journey to find their destinies.The day I finished reading Soul Reborn, I told my neighbor what a fantastic read it was. She started reading it the following day and she too found Soul Reborn to be a great read from an up and coming PNR/UF author. Her comment \u201cThis book reminds me of Kresley Cole\u2019s writing style. I love the relationship between the sisters, their actions and conversations are authentic and captivating. Bravo to Jean Murray.\u201dWow! So this is actually two reviews in one *grin*. You can find Murray\u2019s books on Amazon and Barnes & Noble. I only have one thing I am not a fan of and that is the cover. Had this book not been recommended, I am not certain I would have picked it to add to my Kindle TBR list. I am however grateful that I did not judge this book by its cover. In my opinion, the cover does nothing to draw the reader into the fantastic world Murray has created, and after reading it, it doesn\u2019t truly represent the strength and sensuality of Lily. This comment is not meant to offend, it is meant to make sure you look beyond the image and go buy this book! I look forward to the next in the series, Soul Awakened.

Sincerely! I don't really know what I expected but it surprised me in such a way that as the tension escalated in the book, so did my heart rate. As things got sweet and touching, my heart melted with the characters. Ms. Murray paints a picture of her characters that is so easy to see in your mind you feel like you can almost reach out and touch them. You'll know what I mean when you \"meet\" Asar's warriors.This is such a fresh take on the paranormal that we have all been reading. First off Jean Murray goes for the Egyptian mythology instead of the well-known Greek mythology. Then, instead of using vampires and shifters and such she uses some other very creative \"species\" to bump up the action a notch. The main character, Lily, is a fighter, but she also has a kind heart and it shows. Ms. Murray really lets that show through. Lily has 2 sisters that we learn about and get to know a little bit (but I believe we'll get to know them up close and personal in books 2 and 3). The sisters are very protective of each other. One is a warrior like Lily, the other is a researcher. Their father is/was an archeologist and took them on dig sites, which is where this all begins. Ms. Murray does such an awesome job with book 1 that I had to e-mail her and BEG for book 2 to come out already! (Of course, I have NO pull in that category but its nice to try -- ha ha). Bottom line -- GET THIS BOOK!

Luckily I happen to have it.I enjoyed the writing of this story, the pace was just right for me and I liked the action/fighting scenes as well as the romance. The writing flowed very well and kept me interested through the entire book. One of the main parts of the book was the discovery of Lilly and her sister\u2019s mother. I did figure it out quite a bit before it was revealed but it did not bother me to figure it out and not be surprised.The main character Lilly is a huntress. She hunts down and kills the revens (zombies) on Earth to protect humans. She however takes on guilt and responsibility for everyone and everything. That is the one thing I would change about her because it does get irritating when she constantly takes responsibility for what others do but everyone has flaws and I have met a couple like this before. Asar is definitely a force to be reckoned with but he meets his match with Lilly. I really enjoyed watching how the story builds and how the villain is caught.

Lilly and Kit are trained huntress to take down revens that are over populating and destroying humanity. What seems like an epidemic is not what it seems. With their sister, Kendra, the Carrigan sisters take up the most dangerous task of saving mankind.Right from the start, this seems like a simple novel however deeper into the story it gets more complex and interesting. This is what I love the most, stories that aren't boring. The sisters will meet Asar, an Egyptian underworld god, and the story takes a whole new level. I don't want to spoil the whole story for you guys since this is one book that has great potential and should be appreciated as you read it.I'd talk about the characters though. The characters are amazing, well written and definitely has depth and dimension. You'll love the main characters and also the secondary ones. Everyone will stand out and there will never be a single boring part of the book. With that said, this book can be a hefty read. For one, I am not really familiar with Egyptian mythology and the names can be difficult to remember though short but you'll get used to it as you familiarize yourself with everyone. Because of the amount of information divulged, this book can be daunting. It is the first in a series and it can be intimidating but after a few chapter, you'll get used to it. I consider myself a fast reader, with book under 300 pages I can finish it in 2 days but with Soul Reborn it took me longer.This is my first experience reading Murray's work as well as Egyptian mythology and I've been sold.

And while many will try to relate it to the Biblical story; they will fall far short of the mark.This story has it all; mythology, plagues, deaths, zombies, war, and most important, love. However, it is a love fraught with tension and trouble because the two lovers are not just figuratively opposites but literally opposites; one is human, the other... Well that is a great question. In the book, they are referred to as demi-gods. The story rests upon the Egyption, rather than Greek, facets of mythology. Our heroine, Lilly, is one of the trusted Huntresses. Our hero is a demi-god called Asar. The author has created an Earth that is still part of the mystical age, yet part of the current age as well. One where Lilly can interact with and \"control?\" the leader of the underworld. Of course, our hero has been cursed and believe he does not have a soul; that in its place is only hatred and vindictiveness. But then he meets Lilly and things quickly heat up. It isn't long before Azar knows he needs Lilly.In fact, the only thing keeping Lilly and Azar apart is a plague. A plague that Lilly fears she unleashed, and the underworld is positive the humans unleashed. We are talking about the end of everything. However, the sexual interaction between Lilly and Azar puts everything, even the possible end of the world, a distant problem that cannot touch them while they are together.Jean Murray is a force to be reckoned with.

Nearby, three undead revens pursue a curfew-breaking human with intent to feast on flesh. Asar intends to intercept their prey before their party gets started. His craving is for souls; the human they are hunting has a particularly sweet one, and he has no intention of letting such a meal go to waste on lowly cannibals. But when the cursed death-dealer of the Underworld turns a corner, he is surprised to find the revens decapitated. He recognizes the work as that of a skilled swordsman. A hunter. The desire to feed on the soul becomes greater with anticipation of a fight.He is surprised then to find that the hunter is a woman. A very beautiful and feisty woman. Her every move and word entices him further. In the end, she retracts her blades from the superficial wounds they\u2019ve cut into his chest. Asar allows her to flee into the dawn, catching one floating strand of gold hair she leaves behind. Shortly after, Asar\u2019s brother suggests that he admires the woman, but Asar denies it. She\u2019s only human, after all, and he\u2019s a god. In truth, though, everything about the woman seems more than human. Hunger becomes intrigue and he wants to know more about her.I, personally, would go so far as to say that Asar is smitten at first sight. When one considers that Asar is living without both his heart and soul, the fact that the man feels anything for her should tell him that something big revolves around her. He might even see it quicker than he does were he not so preoccupied with punishing Kepi, a sorry excuse for a goddess who literally stole his heart, soul, the physical key to the Underworld, and his son.An aside\u2026his son isn\u2019t a kidnapped child. Asar\u2019s family\u2013him, his brother, and his son\u2014plays a critically important role in the balance of power among both Pantheons of Egyptian gods. Asar has kept Bakari\u2019s absence a secret from nearly everyone because the knowledge that he\u2019s not around will have devastating consequences for the gods and humans alike. This is a testament to Asar\u2019s character, considering once again that he doesn\u2019t have a heart or a soul. He can\u2019t do his job without them, but he clings to the man he used to be and that keeps him from being the animal he easily could have become.The huntress, Lilith \u201cLilly\u201d Carrington, is one of three daughters abandoned young by their mother. Five years ago, while on a South American dig, Lilly and her archeologist father uncovered a tomb with Egyptian hieroglyphs and artifacts. Not long after, an undead plague swept the face of the Earth, condemning mankind to live under strict daylight curfews or risk becoming infected. Lilly, her sister Kit, and a number of other women submit to a painful Egyptian spell to have black asps embedded in their backs. They become Nehebkau, an army of assassins to destroy the undead. Still the numbers of the reven continue to grow.Asar comes to believe that Lilly\u2019s youngest sister, Kendra, and her PhD in Egyptology, may be able to help find his stolen key to the Underworld. Lilly exchanges promises with Asar\u2026her servitude in return for his word that no harm will come to her sisters. The cursed god does admire her strength and her love for her sisters. To show her that life will not be horrible, Asar takes Lilly to Aaru. There, she falls in love with her future master, and Asar unwitting awakes something within her that has been sleeping since her birth. When her power begins to manifest, the layers of the Kepi situation began to peel away, revealing to the gods\u2026all of them\u2026that they have far bigger problems than Asar being unable to do his job.A Soul Reborn is a story about honor and loyalty, about owning fault and accepting the consequences, and about knowing when to hold on and when to let go. Asar is a man who ignored wise counsel, and when Kepi betrayed him, he blamed her, blamed the humans that released her from her sarcophagus, and promised vengeance on everyone involved. He never stopped to consider his own fault in the situation. At the opposite extreme, Lilly blamed herself for the curse on her father which then spread to mankind. She puts herself in extreme danger in an attempt to atone, one reven at a time, for her curiosity. When Asar and Lilly come together to confront Kepi\u2019s threat, they must both let go\u2026he of anger to which he\u2019s not truly entitled, and she of guilt that was never hers to carry.I do have one complaint about the novel. When Asar does accept his responsibility, it comes in the form of an abrupt about-face. His trusted counsel says, \u201cI told you so\u201d and he accepts that as true. And just like that, he absolves Lilly of her role. I would have preferred Asar to wrestle with his conscience, because by this point in the story, he does have one. I would have liked the guilt and remorse steadily settle on him. But, the subsequent scenes, however, were satisfying enough to smooth that wrinkle out for me.I believe fans of Lynn Rush, or of Paranormal romance in general, will enjoy Soul Reborn. Two sequels are coming, and I\u2019m very much looking forward to Asar and Lilly\u2019s next adventure."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13904519-kristin", "userReview": "I truly wish I could give this book more than five stars because it\u2019s worth a lot more than that. I have never read anything dealing with Egyptian mythology before and this book introduced me to it in a way that was fun, enjoyable and magical. I love the story. It was well developed and thought out. The plot flows so well that when I finished, I was disappointed to be done. I love the depth that Ms. Murray went in explaining the myths as well as the details surrounding them.The characters were just amazing. I loved Asar; he\u2019s such a broody God that grows and changes throughout the book. He learns things not just about Lilly, but himself. Asar learns that sometimes it\u2019s possible for light to survive in the dark if it\u2019s given enough love and car. His feelings for Lilly are just beautiful and he helps her grow as well.Lilly is just baddass. Seriously. I want to be her when I grow up. She can kick butt and take names, then can transform literally into a beautiful goddess. Lillly has difficult choices to make in this book but the strength that she shows when making them was phenomenal. I love that she struggled with who Asar is; I don\u2019t think anyone would find it easy to fall in love with the God of the Underworld. Lilly shows so much growth that by the end of the book, I could see she found peace with who and what she is.Go buy this book right now. It\u2019s worth the read. I enjoyed it so much that I\u2019ve picked up book two to read when I get a chance. I have to know what happens.***Review has been done in conjunction with Nerd Girl Official."}, {"userName": "Cianna Sunshine & Mountains Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1848404-cianna-sunshine-mountains-book-reviews", "userReview": "Well, this book was AMAZING! Don't let the few reviews sway you. I fully love this book, and it was fantastic. I'm not even really a romance reader. I don't finish with a romance book unless the plot is well written, logical, and engaging! This one was all that and more.I've got a thing for history and mythology. I love it. I've read many stories about gods, goddesses, and mythical places, but one of my favorites is reading stories about the Underworld, and the god of the Underworld. They usually get a bad rap, but I just can't believe all they are is evil. I've got to say that Jean's take on the God of the Underworld, mixed with Egyptian mythology is FANTASTIC! It's got a really edge of your seat engaging paranormal story line, some badass female main characters (which isn't easy to find in romance), and a very smoking Egyptian God! I loved every minute of this novel.The \"adult scenes\" are well written, and not too over the top. They work with the plot, and not against it, and they further the storyline. I loved it! Jean knows her stuff, and is a fantastic writer! I'm on to book 2 now!If you like paranormal romance, pick this book up! You won't regret diving in!*I was given a copy in exchange for an honest review.

Admittedly, I am more used to reading SciFi / Fantasy fiction that had less of the romance part, e.g. McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series comes to mind. However, like the SciFi/Fantasy of McCaffrey's Pern novels, I think Jean Murray did a great job on this book and set the stage very well. The book is packed with lots of action and battle scenes that kept me bound to the story. Yes, the romance part was there as well, but it was balanced so that even readers that don't normally read romance, like me, will want to keep reading because the storyline is compelling. The book and its series are focused on the lives of the Carrigan sisters. Two of these sisters are feisty and the third seems at first to be a nerdy sweetheart, but since this book only focuses on one of these sisters, I'll have to wait and see if this initial assessment holds true. As an atypical paranormal romance reader, I was really impressed with story and I look forward to reading the next book in the series (Soul Awakened). I hear Jean and her publisher are expected to release that in the summer of 12."}, {"userName": "Mary Quire", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18322150-mary-quire", "userReview": "Review of Soul RebornSoul Reborn is the first book in the Key to the Cursed. I am usually not thrilled to read through extremely heavy sexual scenes but the plot of the story was just so good that the annoyance of reading through scenes just wasn't there. I loved the characters. And let's get real here, who wouldn't love Asar? I honestly haven't enjoyed such a dark and curious character since Death from Terry Pratchett's Disk World series. As for Lilly, the lead female character, I found myself sympathizing with her and the guilt she carried for events that were out of her control. Anyone who enjoys a bit of heavy romance would enjoy the book, but for those who are not big readers in this genre I have something which may sway you to take a chance. This book is completely action-packed. The scenes are written with impeccable detail but flow smoothly, sucking you in easily. And the mix of mythology and present day horror causes for one heck of a ride.Kudos to Jean Murray!"}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5105152-anne", "userReview": "I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect when I started this book. I liked the idea of Egyptian mythology with a modern twist but the story surprised me and kept me on edge as I devoured the pages. Jean Murray created a detailed world with Soul Reborn, the first in the Key to the Cursed series. What sucked me in were the rich details with the characters and story line. Yes Asar was a complex, alpha male and Lilly was fearless, strong and at times stubborn. The conflict yet attraction between them was intense and electric. Each character introduced brought more life to this tale. The story is great combination of paranormal, romance, urban fantasy topped off with an abundance of gods, goddesses and zombies. This seems like a lot to take on but Jean masters it with ease. The story flowed as the characters connected. The story tackled a lot of ground but by the final pages, everything fit together. I am definitely hooked to find out what happens next in this series."}, {"userName": "Beth Tilley", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5493820-beth-tilley", "userReview": "This book was great. It had everything a girl could want: Gods & Goddesses, Ancient Egypt, True Love, Suspense & super steamy love scenes..and much more. Jean Murray had me hooked from page 1. The plot was original and fast paced. Love at first sight. I seriously CANNOT wait for the next book. I would definitely recommend this book!!! The connection between Asar & Lilly is so fierce you cannot help but feel it through the pages. He's the original Alpha male God. The road to redemption for Asar keeps me turning the page. I know Lilly is the hero of this book but some of the time her sister, Kit, stole the show!
