Gustav \"Old Red\" Amlingmeyer. The man who has to listen to him? His brother, Otto \"Big Red\" Amlingmeyer. Something more is disagreeing with Old Red than the fact that he's traveling on a train. In fact, he has his brother completely mystified. You see, Old Red has the deep distrust of railroads that just about everyone does who's been raised on a farm in the late 1800s, and Big Red would love to know why his older brother insisted that they become railroad detectives on the Pacific Express.The answer is rather simple: Old Red is tired of being a cowboy. He wants to follow in the footsteps of his hero, Sherlock Holmes, and give \"detectifying\" a try. Little do the two brothers know that they're in for a wild ride. They're being shadowed by a gang of outlaws who've already shown that they can rob the Pacific Express. There's a baggage car stuffed to the rafters with all sorts of deadly secrets, and amongst the colorful passel of passengers lurks a vicious killer. Getting trapped on this train as it barrels through the snowy High Sierras means that the Amlingmeyers need to be as good at deductifying as Mr. Holmes... or they're going to be fertilizer for the daisies that will bloom come spring.My first piece of advice to you (besides \"Get your hands on this book!\") is to buckle up. It's been a few days since I've read On the Wrong Track, and I still feel as though I just fell off a rollercoaster after one helluva ride. Putting the Amlingmeyers on a train is a piece of genius. Those old steam locomotives scream Wild West, and what better setting for two cowboy detectives and a memorable cast of passengers?There are passengers who aren't whom they appear to be, although they behave normally. There are passengers who act in a suspicious manner... but are they really up to something? Fellow railroad employees are by turns friendly, helpful, grouchy, mean, secretive, bossy.... A reader's head can spin without adding a gang of outlaws to the mix!Once that train pulls out of the station, the pace turns into a runaway. One calamity after another strikes until it's almost impossible for those two detectifying brothers-- or the reader-- to catch their breath. To say I loved this book would be an understatement. I didn't so much read it as experience it. Steve Hockensmith gave me a ticket to ride, and I think I whooped and hollered all the way down the tracks. However, I'd like to caution you about one thing: If you have a fear or loathing of our legless reptilian brethren, I'd advise you to skip chapter twenty-three. I'm still keeping my Louisville Slugger at hand... and sitting with my feet off the floor.If you have yet to read a book in this series, get your hands on one and read it! Odds are you'll then be following Old Red and Big Red wherever they may wander. When I turned the last page of On the Wrong Track, all I could do was remove my Stetson, beat off some of the dust, and grin."}, {"userName": "M.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2757769-m", "userReview": "On the Wrong Track is the second in the series following drovers Otto (Big Red) and Gustav (Old Red) Amlingmeyer, brothers and readers of Sherlock Holmes in the Old West.Despite the fact that they make him toss his cookies, Gustav convinces his younger brother Otto to sign on with the Southern Pacific Railroad as undercover detectives. What follows is the train ride from Hell, as it becomes evident that one of the riders is a ruthless killer!Like the first book in the series (Holmes on the Range), the story here moves at a quick yet entertaining pace as the brothers try to figure out the who, what and why using Holmesian methodology (and do so without becoming dead). Steve Hockensmith has a talent for seamlessly integrating a variety of scenes into his writing, from action (lots of it) to comedy (lots of it) to heartfelt moments that further define his lead characters (excellent).The next time you feel like reading something 'fun', pick up a selection from this series!"}, {"userName": "David Monroe", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1223383-david-monroe", "userReview": "Cowboys Otto \u201cBig Red\u201d Amlingmeyer and his brother Gustav \u201cOld Red\u201d are back and they're tired.

There was enough plot and character development to keep me reading. And periodically there was a small infusion of humor. But I was not sufficiently captured by the story to justify a higher rating. I'd give it a 3.5 if allowed, maybe even a 3.75. Several times I was taken aback by a question as to whether some aspect of the story was historically accurate. For instance, Helen Keller was referenced, as was Chicago's Columbian exposition, which put the story in the mid-1890s. It made me wonder whether her story would have been widely known when she would have been 15 years old. It's possible, but it was a distraction from the story The read was good enough for me to read another one. I appreciated the deductive skills of the counterpart to Holmes - Gustav, as well as the more \"L'Amourian\" characteristics to the narrator Otto, Gustav's younger brother (who also served as an obtuse Watson).It was a quick read, so better than 3 stars."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/653338-trish", "userReview": "The second tale of the Amlingmeyer brothers, Old Red and Big Red. This time, the cowboy detectives have taken their first step toward professional deducifyin'--they've landed jobs as railroad detectives, of a sort. Lately, the Southern Pacific Railroad has been plagued by the Give 'Em Hell Boys. But Gustav and Otto aren't supposed to track down the bandits; they're supposed to keep an eye out for an inside man whose in cahoots with the robbers. Before they have had time to do much more than meet their fellow passengers (and for Big Red to realize that his brother is beset by motion sickness), the brothers see something bouncing down the tracks behind the train, and that something should preferably be firmly affixed to a man's neck. When the train stops so they can investigate, they find the head and the body of the baggage car attendant, Pezzulo. Add to the mix two coffins, a toupee, a small china bowl, a \"Chinaman\" returning to San Francisco from the World's Fair in Chicago, a drunken Pinkerton, a saucy news boy, a snake in a crate, a crate full of bricks, and a quick-thinking woman who reads herself to sleep with a Southern Pacific Railroad manual."}, {"userName": "Erin L", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3217959-erin-l", "userReview": "So, I listened to this on the weekend. It wasn't my first choice for my long drive, but I did like the first in the series well enough to give book two a shot.I'm so glad I did.I should probably let everyone know that in my late teens and early twenties, I was in love with the Western genre. My grandmother was helping me collect every Louis L'Amour or Zane Grey she came across and I loved reading every one of them. I had a particular fondness for L'Amour's Sackett series.Steve Hockensmith has created some pretty great characters with Gustav and Otto and it's an audiobook where the voice of the reader can really have an effect on the story.

In this instalment, they are hired by the Southern Pacific Railroad as detectives on a Utah to California trip, and run up against notorious train robbers.The voice in this series is as breezy and refreshing as I remember it, albeit containing profanity of the day, but the villain in this particular piece was a little too obvious, for not being obvious, if you know what I mean. It was still fun to follow Old Red as he trailed the clues and filled in the details. Read this if: you\u2019re looking for a good non-thriller mystery, especially in a 19th century western setting; or you\u2019re a fan of Sherlock Holmes (you\u2019ll be tickled how much Old Red tries to imitate him.) 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Andie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14758650-andie", "userReview": "This book has been rather difficult for me to read. I've tried to pick it up a couple of times, and it has been very difficult for me to get into. I thought the beginning was slow and hokey and I really didn't like the writing style. It picked up once the main characters got on the train and hit the mystery of the novel... but then it kind of stayed at the same level of fascination for me for the rest of the book.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to a lot of people. If you're really into western mysteries, and you're strapped for things to read, sure, pick it up, it's not the most terrible, but it also isn't particularly good in my opinion.Also - I realize that this is set in the 1800s and like, racism existed at the time and that's just how it was, but I really wasn't into the instances of racism in the story.

But I'm pretty proud of myself for having sussed out the killer's identity all on my own -- and pretty early on, at that.Of course, there is much more to this story than a simple whodunit.
