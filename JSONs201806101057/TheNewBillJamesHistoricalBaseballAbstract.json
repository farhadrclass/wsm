For example, after I read the section on Mickey Mantle as a centerfielder, I might want to go back and read the section on Joe DiMaggio, The book is divided into two major sections. The first third or so of the book is a decade-by-decade history of the game. Each brief history includes information on who played the game, how it was played and where it was played; how it changed from one decade to another; who were the stars of each decade; and bits and pieces of information that you never even thought about before. The rest of the book discusses James' evaluations of the best 100 layers at each position. As you might imagine, these evaluations are statistically-based, but always tempered by James' thought and interesting more subjective analysis. Who were the best players at each position? Catcher, Yogi Berra; 1B, Lou Gehrig; 2B, Joe Morgan; 3B, Mike Schmidt; SS, Honus Wagner; LF, Ted Williams; CF, Willie Mays; RF, Babe Ruth; P, Walter Johnson. Wanna argue? Read James' book first or you will look foolish."}, {"userName": "Steve Rosenberg", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279937-steve-rosenberg", "userReview": "They asked me to guess the date I read this book. I put down August 2007. The reality is, I first picked up this book in August 2003 and have not put it down since, except to eat, sleep, good to the bathroom, go to work, etc. etc. etc. It is like a bible to me. Okay, that is putting it mildly. The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract is quite possibly - no, absolutely - the best book written about baseball, ever. Hands down. What is so special, you may ask? Well, the stats, for one. James lays out his methods and arguments for sabrmetrics, the art of judging baseball talent through a historical lens, through the use of stats and a reasonable analysis thereof. And he makes it INTERESTING. It reminds me of the tax professor I had in law school; he could teach federal income taxation to a reasonably bright 5-year-old, and make it fun; well, Bill James is like that. But more than the stats are the stories; the historical anecdotes are those that you can find only by combing the baseball section of your local city library for weeks on end, or by accosting some crazy old guy who once saw Babe Ruth pitch for the Red Sox. And best of all, James injects a healthy dose of opinion and attitude into everything he says. If you cannot tell by now, I am in love with this book; it has gotten me through more than one night of insomnia; if I had one book to bring with me to a desert island, this would be the one. If you are a baseball fan, this book is required reading."}, {"userName": "Bern", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6321375-bern", "userReview": "I don't think you're supposed to read this book cover-to-cover, but it's an amazing compendium of information and I did anyway. Sometimes James assumes that the reader shares his encyclopedic knowledge of baseball. I don't, but then again, only one of us wrote an encyclopedia.I'm giving the book four stars rather than five because of some chip-on-James's-shoulder ranting that's great when defending the preposterous lifetime ban on Pete Rose, but not-so-great when defending old-time players' racism (\"the KKK in the 1920s had a populist phase in which it toned down its racism, and drew in hundreds of thousands of men who were not racists\") or ablism (\"Is it not possible that calling William Hoy \"Dummy\" was a form of inclusiveness? [...] Maybe we could compromise, and list him in future encyclopedias as 'Ole' Hearing and Speech Impaired Hoy'\") or just being sexist for no apparent reason (\"Our government at this moment is forcing universities to spend millions of dollars a year upon the frankly preposterous theory that women care as much about sports as men do, or anyway ought to.)."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53686-leah", "userReview": "I absolutely ADORE this book. Anyone who likes baseball, whether a casual or hardcore fan, should immediately get this book. It's perfect for a bathroom book, even! It goes through baseball by the decade since the 1870s, and makes it INTERESTING! Bill James emphasizes that we love baseball b/c we are emotionally invested in it. So he writes the history of the game in a way that we can be emotionally invested in historical players and teams. It covers teams, players, rules, scandals, births, deaths, and even uniforms. I'm only through the 1930s right now, but it is already one of the best baseball books I've ever read.A note - this is written by a baseball stat geek, but you don't have to know that much about stats to understand it. He explains well. But if you're someone like Joe Morgan who doesn't believe in baseball analysis using statistics, it might piss you off. I, however, love stat geeks."}, {"userName": "Int'l librarian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3101314-int-l-librarian", "userReview": "This is my favorite book of all-time.

Tear down your idols and your mythology and get right to the meat of it. Understand your history to create a new future. Bill James has done this with baseball. Instead of just slapping hits, runs and errors into a petri dish, he's got his own (well-researched) spin on things and looks at baseball through a totally different lens than his forerunners, making it at one time both a game of statistic and of individuals. He covers the early days (1850s) up to the present in amazing detail but with a great understanding of the relevance of those oft-maligned statistics. His wife also contributes giving great sidebar topics from time-to-time. It might be a history of baseball, but it's a personal history.A fascinating read for anyone who gives a loves the game of baseball."}, {"userName": "Troy Goodfellow", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1409402-troy-goodfellow", "userReview": "Bill James again brings original insight to historical debates without losing track of what makes baseball the best sport.

I could talk about sabermetrics ALL DAY! In fact, I recently had a discussion with a friend of mine who hates OPS, and I proved why it was important--not to prove that Pujols is better than Johnny Damon, for example, but to show that Gehrig was better than Foxx--in fact, MUCH better. So, anyway, I digress, as Bill James does. A critic has said that James is wasting his brilliant mind on baseball, but of course there's no such thing as wasting anything re: baseball. His writing meanders quite a bit, and there are some sentences in there so awkward that I'm shocked an editor didn't catch them. Almost single-handedly started the fantasy league craze, which is VERY upsetting, as even I am tired of the ticker of stats scrolling across the screen. But he also started the mode of writing A LOT about baseball, and almost every sabermetrician in the last 20 years owes something to him. He did change the face of baseball, starting with Billy Beane and Moneyball. Someone with better writing skills should take a few of his articles and expound a bit deeper about the social and moral implications they cover. But his writing IS compulsive: I've read his abstracts over and over and over, though some of the articles are reprinted! He's way off base about Jim Rice, though. Clear HOF candidate between 1975 and 1986, and it's not Rice's fault that there wasn't a ton of 5-tool players during that time. Rice was one-dimensional--but nobody did that dimension better in that era."}, {"userName": "Jef Cotham", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41169967-jef-cotham", "userReview": "This book should be to ardent baseball fans what the Bible is to devout Christians. Although James ostensibly allows understandable disdain for players such as Rogers Hornsby to slightly affect his judgment (as evidenced by ranking Joe Morgan as a better player than Horsnby), on the whole James probably does the most effective job ever of objectively ranking baseball's greatest players. This is a gargantuan task, arguably one that cannot be done without engendering some sort of conflict. Few people are willing to evaluate players from all prominent leagues (especially the Negro Leagues) and all eras due to a dearth of meaningful information, yet James approaches the task with earnest humility. His historical insights are not only revealing but also highly entertaining. The writing of James supports the notions that brevity is the soul of wit and that digression is a necessary component of worthwhile entertainment. This wonderful book is not only a fun read but also a useful reference tool. It effectively illustrates how baseball appeals to the statistician, historian, sentimentalist, writer, collector, entertainer, realist, dreamer, seeker, logophile, provocateur, and child in each of us."}, {"userName": "Art", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3252699-art", "userReview": "I was a big fan of the Bill James yearly abstracts. He then turned to doing this Historical Abstract which reviews how baseball was played decade by decade AND ranks the top 100 players at every position. The book tries to explain the statistics he uses, in some cases, developed. Most of the time he is successful. In one instance, he didn't even try and left it at \"it's too far over your head, just believe me it works\" which was extremely annoying.The decade reviews are fun to read and mostly well organized. In the player sections, he gives a blurb about each player. Sometimes it turns into a very readable essay trying to make a specific point (i.e. Willie Mays vs. Mickey Mantle). But, every once in a while he makes an inane remark about a player. One player (Jeff Bagwell ranked #4 under First Basemen) wasn't even given a blurb... under his ranking was the word \"Pass.\"! If you are going to rank a person then give a good reason (i.e. like George Sisler) for your ranking!So, for these reasons, I cannot give this book a 5 star rating!NOTE: I downloaded the 2010 edition and re-read before writing this review."}, {"userName": "Brian S", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1975631-brian-s", "userReview": "Great book. The all-time rankings, overall and by position, are fun to read through. I wish there was a 2015 update. I\u2019d like to know where James ranks Derek Jeter on the all-time shortstop list, likewise Ivan Rodriguez on the catcher list, etc. James uses some excellent concepts, like secondary average (which is meant to capture a similar thing as OPS) and the basic idea that you need to look at players\u2019 stats in comparison to the other players playing at the same time. A .320 batting average in the 1930s, when 41% of regular players hit .300 or higher, pales in comparison to a .320 in the 1960s when only 12% of players hit over .300. Lots of things to argue about too, i.e., James claims Craig Biggio is a better player than Ken Griffey Jr. and offers a long and detailed argument to substantiate it. Discuss. I was pleasantly surprised with the historical decade by decade section of the book (about half the book) as well."}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott", "userReview": "This book is a very entertaining reference for baseball fans. Bill James has made his name through quantitative analysis of the game, looking for answers to questions that could not be answered, or had unsatisfying/incomplete answers, through \"traditional\" baseball statistics. James does not mean for this book to be definitive; when he ranks the 100 best players of all time at each position, he provides statistical reasoning, but also funny anecdotes and quotes about the players - just enough fodder for a good discussion or further inquiry. The book covers early baseball and the Negro Leagues, as well as the more statistically-friendly period from the early 1900's to the present. James intends the book to be picked up and browsed in small bits, not read from cover-to-cover. I'll keep this (and my son's Bill James 2011 Baseball Handbook) on the end table beside my chair, and I'll refer to it while watching or listening to games all season long."}, {"userName": "ACS Librarian", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52549962-acs-librarian", "userReview": "This is my favorite book of all-time.
