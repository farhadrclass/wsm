Just after picking it up and reading the opening chapter on how to tell if you actually are trapped in a horror movie....I discovered a box of very old books I hadn't realized I even owned??? Upon finding them I went searching out shelf space for the dusty old volumes (oddly as soon as I went into the dark bedroom to shelve the books my cat screamed and leapt from one of the shadowy shelves right at me. She'd never done anything like that before...weird.) As I settled down to read How To Survive a Horror Movie...an unpredicted thunder storm broke outside and we had a power failure. Well, doing the obvious thing I went into the dark attic to rummage through a still packed box to find a flashlight, (we just moved into this place...it was oddly torn up and had a lot of damage to the walls and woodwork before the landlord did the repairs, he was strangely close mouthed about who lived here before, and what happened.) Anyway, having gotten the flashlight (I'll have to check out that odd noise, the rattling scrape that kept up over in the darkest corner of the attic while I was up there, but I don't have time now.) I returned to my dark corner with my favorite chair, near the unusual little rock I found in the garden, the one that seems to have a human face on it. I keep it on my computer desk. Anyway, with my flashlight I started to read again only to be distracted by a huge clap of thunder and an unusually bright flash of lightening. The flash showed a face outside the window, some guy in a hockey mask...Well you get the idea, it wasn't shaping up to be a great night. Along with the Zombie Survival Guide this may be an essential volume for well...surviving, you know, staying alive and not ending up dead....or undead, or whatever.The book is fun, I got a lot of laughs and while it's not actually funny from cover to cover, it's enough so that I'll give it a 4. Oh, the lights are back on.You'll have to excuse me now, there's someone at the door and they're stuck out in the storm. The TV came back on with the power and I have to turn it down, so I can hear what the person at the door is saying. There was something on the TV about an escaped mental patient, a murderer from the hospital for the criminally insane and I can't leave whoever that is out there in the storm with a dangerous killer on the loose....Noticed there's an Audible version of this now (and it's their daily special today) if you're interested in an audio version."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "i had to read this when i saw that he has a jane austen/zombie book coming out soon. this was a good way to kill time until the release date. but now i am finally going to have to read pride and prejudice!! dammit!"}, {"userName": "Latasha", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8253900-latasha", "userReview": "this book is HILARIOUS!!!!! if you love - or even just like- horror movies, you should own this book."}, {"userName": "Trudi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416912-trudi", "userReview": "Horror movies and I? We go way back. I've been a voracious consumer since I was eight and my enthusiasm for the genre hasn't diminished with ... ahem ... maturity and wisdom. So yeah, it's been a lifelong love affair, one I don't hide, or feel I need to apologize for. Because even amidst the dreck, there exists some awesome cinematic gems, and amidst the classics there are film moments of hair-raising, heart-stopping, enviable genius. The naysayers who decry: \"how can you watch that garbage\" are rude asshats, unimaginative douchebags or big fat chickens. Okay, maybe that's a little harsh. Rationally I know horror movies aren't for everyone, but there's that rabid part of my brain that thinks if you're not with us, you're against us. In writing this little manifesto on how to survive a horror movie, Seth Grahame-Smith proves that he understands horror and humor are a marriage made in heaven \u2013 the two go together like Pam and Jim, Butch and Sundance, Pancho and Lefty, Dolly and Kenny and that other celestial match \u2013 Sam and Bruce. Horror indulges in all forms of comedy \u2013 satire, slapstick, black, blue, Freudian, farce, irony \u2013 you name it, it\u2019s been done; in some cases to humbling effect, either deliberately with great focus, or by happy, moronic accident. Don\u2019t believe me? Look no further than these cinema classics (and I\u2019m not being facetious here): An American Werewolf in London, Evil Dead I and II, The Return of the Living Dead, Creepshow, and Shaun of the Dead. All of the above are prime examples of why I\u2019d rather be watching horror movies rather than reading about them. But every now and then a book of this sort breaks through my defenses, giving me that \u201ccome hither\u201d look I just can\u2019t resist. This book has giggles, a few gut busters, and a whole lot of in-jokes delivered with tongue firmly planted in cheek. There are some sections that fall flat being over-written and a little dumb, but there are also shining moments of pure cleverness. Any die-hard horror fan who reads this little book is going to think \u201cI could have written this and probably done a better job\u201d; maybe, but you didn\u2019t, and neither did I so we\u2019re going to shut our pie holes and give props where they\u2019re due. More than anything, this little book is pure goddamn fun. Plain and simple. However, it is not a classic \u2013 for that you have to read If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor and Danse Macabre. These definitive texts will teach you everything you need to know about the industry, the genre, the people who make their living by it, and the people who love it. Seth Grahame-Smith wants to make us laugh, but it also comes across how much he loves celluloid horror and because of that I know he is one of us and therefore to be trusted. There are just too many delightful nuggets to quote from here and rather than trying to capture them all I\u2019m just going to say go read the book. But I can\u2019t resist throwing out a few of my favorites:The Seven Deadly Horror Movie Sins: 3rd Deadly Sin: Independence \u2013 \u201cScrew you guys I\u2019m going home\u201d. Actually you\u2019re going about a third of the way home.5th Deadly Sin: Curiosity \u2013 \u201cDo you think it\u2019s dead?\u201d No. Go ahead and poke it with a stick. How to Defeat a Killer Doll: Kick the Crap Out of It. Why are you running away from something that could be imprisoned with Legos?How to Kill a Vampire: Interview It.

Bad things happen to family.Carrie (1976) \u2013 If you haven\u2019t seen this masterpiece yet, pelt yourself with tampons and go to your prayer closet.The Hitcher (1986) \u2013 How many times do I have to tell you: Never pick up Rutger Hauer!Seven (1995) \u2013 I went to see this film by myself on a cold, rainy Boston day.

Seth Grahame-Smith is quickly becoming a household name, especially with a movie adaption of his Pride & Prejudice & Zombies coming out soon. How to Survive a Horror Movie contains a wealth of his tongue-in-cheek humor that fans will love. As an avid horror movie fan, I appreciated quite a bit of what the author was putting out there in this book. \"What to Do If Your Corn Has Children In It\" may just be the best chapter title ever.The Bad: This is much less useful compared to other pop culture survival books in terms of actual real world application. At least in the Zombie Survival Guide, I learned tips that could be used in situations other than zombie attacks. This book rested solely on its humor and that was asking too much of it. While parts are very funny, others fall flat. This is very much a coffee table book - something to build a conversation around rather than something to be read."}, {"userName": "Brenton", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/177581-brenton", "userReview": "Perhaps capitalizing on the zombie survival trend, this book attempts to cover ALL manner of horror films and tells the reader how to tell if you're in one and what to do next.I found it humorous enough, but it felt like the author was rather stretched for material. He seemed to bounce back and forth between two vantage points - one being that there actually is a Horrorverse and you are in it, the other being that you are just on a movie set. The advice for what to do in the actual Horrorverse was funny and engaging, but it seemed that whenever he ran out of ideas the author started to write as though you are only on a movie set, and tailored his survival advice towards using this fact to your advantage. This seemed like a sloppy copout to me, and damaged the cohesiveness of the book. If you're just on a set, then you're not really in any mortal danger to begin with, so that whole shtick seemed to shoot the book in its own foot."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14717322-michael", "userReview": "Let's be honest here and admit that for the most part that horror films are predictable. Scream gave us some easy to follow rules to survive a horror movie and now we have a survival guide written by the guy who gave us Pride Prejudice And Zombies and Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. How you view this book depends on your views of the horror genre. If you aren't a fan then you'll hate this (if you hate horror films why are you even reading this review?). It's quite a humorous book that doesn't take a lot of time to read and there really useful information packed in here to ensure that you actually survive and live to breath another day.  It clearly takes the piss to the entire genre and nothing is sacred. Everything that you could encounter in the terrorverse is covered. Zombies, vampires, and even killer dolls. Nothing in this book will save you from anything in the real world so if you're looking to fight of muggers or terrorists you are completely fucked. It's obvious that Seth is a fan and that's what makes the book so amusing. You can't help but laugh at these tips even though they could save your life if you're in a horror movie. As a fan and writer of the horror genre I become even more aware of just how predictable this genre is and I think we all know this, but that's why we're all fans. We know what's going to happen and now thanks to Seth we can survive! As good as this book is there's really no reason to re-read this so that drags it down a little. If you laughed the first time what are the odds that you'll find yourself laughing just as hard if you read it a second or third time. It's a great conversation starter for horror fans and it allows us to see the films through the eyes of their creator. When we watch a horror movie we will laugh as everyone dies and we know exactly how to survive. We can thank Seth for giving us the knowledge that will save our asses."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1586244-laura", "userReview": "Hilarious! Takes a lot from classic, easy to recognize horror movies and compiles advice in humorous and bizarre lists. This author has a great sense of humor and the book is pretty short which is the perfect length to end before the jokes get stale.

But the laughs I got from it made it worth it.Sample sections include: How to stay awake for a week, 10 places to never ever, ever go under any circumstances, What to do if you did something last summer, How to tell if you've been dead since the beginning of the movie, What to do if your corn has children in it, etc. Its seriously funny from beginning to end."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71228560-david", "userReview": "the theme is to survive a horror movie"}, {"userName": "J", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32909004-j", "userReview": "This was so awesome.

It was packed with tons of references to various horror movies across the genre (from Halloween to Saw to Snakes on a Plane). And with a foreword by Wes Craven, you may be able to do no wrong.

Clearly, those of us who are not in jail or mental institutions have learned to channel (or divert) our love of horror movies into something healthy. For Grahame-Smith, it's writing books. In \"How to Survive a Horror Movie\", SGS has written the ultimate survival guide for the perhaps unlikely but frighteningly possible scenario of finding one's self stuck in a horror movie. *Would you know the correct weapon to use against a psychotic child-killer that appears to victims in dreams? (Answer: No-Doze and/or having Heather Langenkamp or Johnny Depp as a significant other) *Would you be able to recognize the 10 ways to determine if your house is haunted? (Do your faucets bleed? Does the house tell you to \"get out\"? Are you strangely compelled to murder your entire family with an axe every time you arrive home? If the answer is \"yes\" to all of these, chances are good your house is haunted) *Could you tell when an animal is evil? (Creatures that are \"always evil\", according to SGS: monkeys, rottweilers, and sharks, just to name three.) *Do you know the only correct solution to arriving on a planet full of hostile aliens? (Answer: \"Nuke the entire planet from orbit: it's the only way to be sure...\") This invaluable book is chock-full of excellent advice for keeping your stupid ass alive in case of alien invasions, your car stalls in the middle of an old forgotten town, or if you ever find yourself being chased by kids in a cornfield.

As the title clearly gives away, the book takes you on a step-by-step journey on how to survive being in a horror movie.It starts off with how to tell that you are in a horror movie, and then how to figure out what kind of horror movie you are in. From there is gives you advice on how to survive and handle various situations. The majority of the book goes through all of the stereotypical horror movie sub-genres: slashers, inanimate objects (think dolls and haunted houses), the walking dead, beasts/aliens, and finally demonic movies.The guide is treated with a sense of seriousness, but sarcasm, witty comments, and many nods toward classic horror films keep the read very entertaining.
