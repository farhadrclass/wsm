It's what I remember reading first, and what has driven most of my own writing endeavors. So, while I hardly need an excuse to celebrate the genre, events like Women in Horror Month certainly do provide a convenient prompt for me to look beyond the towering review pile and into well-stocked TBR shelves that fill my e-reader and (quite literally) cover the house.First up this month is Mercedes M. Yardley, and author with whom I was already familiar, but who I got to know a little better during a Ragnarok Publications Facebook party last month. We connected over fiction and music, and she was kind enough to send a copy of Apocalyptic Montessa and Nuclear Lulu: A Tale of Atomic Love my way.Let me just say that this is some of the darkest stuff I've read in a long while. It's daring, original, and manages to accomplish what so many other authors and filmmakers have failed to do. It makes an antagonist of a victim and keeps her at the forefront of the entire novel, with nary a protagonist in sight. It's a risky move, and one that most stories cannot sustain, but Yardley weaves in enough backstory and character development to make her serial killers sympathetic leads. That's not to say they're necessarily likable or characters to whom we can relate, but she forces us to understand them and their motives.This is a crime drama, a love story, and a tale of supernatural myth and magic. It's a book that operates on multiple levels, but which has no patience for easing the reader through unnecessary transitions. There's no one point at which it shifts from crime drama to love story, just as there's no single instance where Montessa shifts from victim to killer. As for the myth and the magic, it's there throughout, but so subtle and fantastic that you're never quite sure when you stopped questioning just much is supernatural and how much is allegory or illusion.It's a seriously messed up world where a victim's love for her killer is more beautiful and pure than a father's love for his child, but that's precisely the world in which we live. When abuse and neglect are found where love should be, how inconceivable is it that love is found where it shouldn't? Yardley really plays with that idea, and uses it to explore who Montessa and Lulu really are, and how they came to be. It's a brutal, bloody, violent tale, full of sorrow and pain, but it's also one redeemed by the presence of love. A lot of people die, in a lot of brutal ways, and the fondness for the act of murder may be too much for some readers to take, but it's all connected.I will admit, I kept seeing flashes from Natural Born Killers in my head as I read this, but Apocalyptic Montessa and Nuclear Lulu: A Tale of Atomic Love trades the satire and the sensationalism for sentiment and sincerity. This is a story not of spectacle, but of spirit, and that intimacy (along with Yardley's almost-poetic narrative) is what makes it work.Originally reviewed at Beauty in Ruins"}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "4 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum http://bibliosanctum.blogspot.com/201...Ragnarok Publications is a publisher newly founded in 2013, but I'd heard of them prior to receiving a copy of Apocalyptic Montessa and Nuclear Lulu: A Tale of Atomic Love. These are the amazing folks behind the Kaiju Rising: Age of Monsters anthology Kickstarter, which was successfully funded this fall and quite possibly one of the coolest projects I've ever backed! It was thus an honor and a pleasure to be offered a chance to read and review their inaugural title by Mercedes M. Yardley.Don't let the quirky title fool you; this is one dark and disturbing tale of supernatural love and horror...because after all, even killers and monsters can fall in love. Montessa Tovar, an exotic dancer who has only known a life of hurt and abuse is abducted one night while walking home by Lu, a serial killer whose unusual power has led him to be labeled a demon. But in time, the victim becomes the accomplice. As the two continue to form the deepest of connections, Lu leads Montessa on a cross-country tour of blood and vengeance.Have you ever asked yourself if you believe in the concept of soulmates? Of finding that one person out there who completes you? This is the idea explored in the book, though if you find the notion utterly romantic, be sure to brace yourself because the author does not do it in a conventional way. It is far from idyllic; characters are depicted in extreme or frightening situations, and there is blood and violence and killing aplenty. It is, however, still a love story, and everyone knows how much I enjoy those. Most surprising of all is that in the darkness, there is also a heart-wrenching beauty. Apocalyptic Montessa and Nuclear Lulu is one of the most interesting and deliciously twisted takes on soulmates I've ever read, and I think it perfectly embodies what the publisher is going for. The reader may never truly come to sympathize with the pair of lovers/killers, but I looked at their heinous crimes separately from the depth of feeling which the author has created. It is the storytelling that matters, and Yardley has accomplished something truly impressive by writing about a love that feels convincingly powerful and real at the same time, all in the short span of a novella. One thing's for sure: it will be hard for me to forget this tale between two horribly damaged people, who somehow find that the pieces of their broken souls fit and complete each other."}, {"userName": "Claudia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6437280-claudia", "userReview": "I rarely read love stories because I know that love more often hurts than it heals and it is more acidic than it is sweet. I have yet to see a happy ending in real life and the idea of soul mates seems doomed to disappoint. And yet, Mercedes Yardley spins a love story that I could not put down. I did read it in one sitting and it was much more than I could have wished for. I believed in these characters living this life and I absolutely embraced the idea of Montessa and Lu being soul mates who were connected by the red string of fate. It is a book about love, revenge and desire, about blood and death. Even though I knew from the start that they were doomed, I rooted them on and I reveled in their need and their willingness to aid and comfort each other in dark and hideous ways. I am a huge fan of Yardley's work and I was as thrilled with this novella as I was with her book of short stories, \"Beautiful Sorrows.\""}, {"userName": "Donald", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3856880-donald", "userReview": "Messed up people need love too. Except that one guy Steve he's a jerk. Montessa and Lulu may be kill crazy and magic, but at least they've got each other, and like Bon Jovi sang \"and that's a lot.\" It's amazing how good writing can make you sympathize and root for people who do horrible things. Yardley pulls it off. You can see these two being a great couple if the hadn't been broken as children.

I cannot honestly ever recall reading something quite like this before; a captivity drama that spirals into a murder-spree love story between and infernal man and bewitched woman. Two fragmented hearts and souls pieced together to make something too terrible and too wonderful for this world to bear.

Check.Eyeliner properly applied? Check.Lights turned off, except for the cool skull lamp from Hot Topic? Check.Playlist set up, containing nothing but lots of The Cure and Creep by Radiohead? Check and Check.Ok, I think I am in the proper mood to read a story of love between two serial killers.Montessa is a special; her mother knew it when she named her while walking through a graveyard. (In the right mood for a horror tale yet?) She has the ability to read people a little better than most; perhaps not the gift it seems to be. Lu drives a big rig and constantly needs to feed a horrible hunger. He watches Montessa for a while. Learns her patterns. Knows the abusive boyfriend will flake, and pounces when the chance comes. Then watches her destroy all his careful plans. The victim becomes the partner; age old wrongs are righted (or double wronged if you insist on being mathematically correct).How does a killer react to a person whose soul is almost dead and is unafraid of death? Is there a difference between Stockholm syndrome and true love of destiny? Can two people who don\u2019t believe in soul mates actually be soul mates? If these are the type of questions that keep you up at night then I have a hell of a tale for you.This is a fucked up story but I see its appeal. Not being a horror reader I certainly am not the intended audience by found myself entertained anyway. Something about the writing just worked; I was often more interested in the craft than the details of the story. The minor supernatural aspects elevated the story; and the relationship was unique if nothing else. The best parts for me came from the way Montessa read people; and how the effects of that knowledge changes as she goes through here strange reawaking.3 stars for me, but this could purely be a genre issue. People looking for a redemption arc in every story they read will hate ever last word. Horror fans are getting a well written novella, and perhaps a story more up their alley.Now if you excuse me, I can\u2019t listen to another damn song from The Cure. And black eyeliner just doesn\u2019t work on me. I may listen to the Radiohead song a few more times though.Review copy was provided to me by Ragnarok Publications."}, {"userName": "Timothy Ward", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4867952-timothy-ward", "userReview": "Mercedes is a master at plucking out secret emotions we wish we could describe and painting them into a portrait of emotion that overwhelms like a thousand small cuts only reality can heal, but it feels so real you wonder if you were more alive inside her prose than you are now that you're gone. The best part is that after you've left, the story's emotions remain tattooed, a memory of beauty and suffering to take with and enjoy at will.A favorite quote from Apocalyptic Montessa and Nuclear Lulu:\"Your first kill?\" she prompted.He faced her then, and the look on his face was the expression of two faces in constant battle with each other. One of snarling hate, a primitive fierceness that made Montessa want to close her eyes, to turn her throat away from his canines. The other, that was the real Lu. A sad, miserable, trapped boy inside a man's body. Someone who cried while he sliced seams in suits of flesh. Somebody who nervously ran bloodied hands through his dark hair, spiking it even more than usual.\"Lu. And Lu. Lulu,\" she said, and was surprised when he laughed. It was a bitter sound, the sound of comfrey petals and bryony boots, things mixed together that shouldn't be, and Montessa's stomach lurched again.This is, as the title says, a love story. I've never read a more tragic pair or felt so close to their experience. I love them."}, {"userName": "Glenn Rolfe", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16739484-glenn-rolfe", "userReview": "I'm a sucker for a good love story, especially a bloody one! True Romance being my all-time favorite.Not quite Clarence and Alabama, the story of Montessa and Lu is another well-crafted piece from Mercedes M. Yardley. The story of two broken and special people who fall for each other in an unorthodox fashion, with Lu eventually leading Montessa on a journey of vengeance. I loved Montessa, and found myself feeling bad for the way she treated herself and for the way she allowed herself to be treated. I also really enjoyed her initial conversations with Lu (especially with her life hanging in the balance).While I didn't hate Lu as a character, I never found myself warming (he he) to him either, but he was a kidnapping murderer so... That doesn't stop the love story from working though. It's pretty easy to see how Montessa could fall in love with him. No one else could empathize with his past. No one else could understand the monster within the way she could. I was able to enjoy the lighter moments of the story, and that doesn't surprise me in the least, the author has proved in the past to be quite capable at writing softer moments hidden among horror and darkness. It's one of her gifts as a writer.All in all, I liked the story, and look forward to the author's next."}, {"userName": "Benoit Leli\u00e8vre", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3634428-benoit-leli-vre", "userReview": "Wow. Simply wow. I was so floored by this small book that I've read it over the course of a single day. APOCALYPTIC MONTESSA AND NUCLEAR LULU was like an Oliver Stone script directed by Wong-Kar Wai. A love story between two lonely, broken souls hanging to existence by any means necessary. I don't want to say too much not to ruin the experience, but I'm a stickler for love stories that feel real and while APOCALYPTIC MONTESSA AND NUCLEAR LULU is so intense it sometimes flirts with melodrama, it gets the job done quite well.All I'm gonna say is: don't take the title for cash. It's not a post-apocalyptic story. LuLu is the nuclear bomb and Montessa is the apocalypse if you know what I mean. APOCALYPTIC MONTESSA AND NUCLEAR LULU is short, great and I will review it in greater details on Dead End Follies for Ladies Month.

Sometimes, the most terrible of circumstances can directly lead to the most wondrous acts of creation. A personal tragedy can spur an artist to craft their life\u2019s seminal work. Addiction can result in the addict steering an otherwise ill-fated existence onto a path of hopefulness. Society can rally around a national catastrophe, bringing people together, opening up pathways to communication and goodwill. This is true even on a cosmic scale, when something as violent as the Big Bang leads to the creation of life, itself.And sometimes, an abused woman and a serial killer can find love, because existence can be the darkest of jokes, whose punch-line is hidden beneath layer after layer of human frailty. It is a play in ten thousand disjointed acts without an ending. A contradiction that is at once both alluring and terrifying.Apocalyptic Montessa and Nuclear Lulu is all of this, and so much more.Mercedes Yardley, as an author, is herself a contradiction. Her work is darkly whimsical, gorgeously macabre, optimistically cynical, and outwardly aloof, with a dash of cheerful angst thrown in for good measure. Her gift with prose is magical; she\u2019s very nearly creating long-form poetry, channeling every bit of darkness you could imagine, stuffing it into a black hole, churning and squeezing and choking the emotions for all they\u2019re worth, and spitting out something absolutely breathtaking on the other side.I really cannot say enough about this book. Sure, you can likely find many antagonists as depraved as Lulu the serial killer. Yes, there have often been Fallen Woman heroines that are as lonely, pathetic, and cursed as Montessa. But you would be hard pressed to find another work of fiction that could demonstrate as much dreadful wonder in their mutual discovery of each other. One is evil, the other tortured; together, their story is somber, ugly, and yet eye-mistingly wonderful.And yes, there is a message lurking within the beautiful prose, hidden in the glint of Lulu\u2019s First Kill Knife. Buried beneath the layers of Montessa\u2019s abuse. Lingering inside the suffocating miasma of ambiguity that governs both of their thoughts.But what that message is, is up to you to decide.That is the last contradiction Yardley has given you.Damn, how I love this appallingly beautiful book.I think I\u2019ve found a new favorite."}, {"userName": "Douglas Wynne", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10610600-douglas-wynne", "userReview": "No one writes quite like Mercedes Murdock Yardley. She breaks rules with the deliberate touch of a writer who learned the rules first, leaving you with the sense that she loving sculpted her clay pigeons before lining them up in front of her shotgun. The indelible fingerprint that she puts on her stories isn't merely found in their stark poetry and unique voice, it's also about how she seduces you into caring for reprehensible characters by making them complex and human and alluring. Apocalyptic Montessa and Nuclear Lulu is a perfect example. It is a delightfully f**ked up love story. I didn't feel good about myself for liking it, but I couldn't stop thinking about it after.

Montessa and Lu are profoundly damaged people who find their love for each other as the result of a crime. The author deftly captures the psychological makeup of victims. Especially with the character of Montessa, she explores the world view of the brutalized and how one surrender leads to another. The description of the thought process rings true. Apocalyptic Montessa and Steven King's Carrie share the similar theme of a woman pushed too far, but where we cheer Carrie on in her reign of terror, Montessa's isn't quite as simple and easy to justify. The author does an excellent job of raising questions about victims and abusers and telling a more nuanced story. Recommend."}, {"userName": "H.W.

I\u2019ve read the book because of the title. It showed on the Goodreads Readers also enjoyed feed of Seth Skorkowsky Hounacier and once I saw it, I just had to try it just to see what kind of story is hidden behind such an amazing title.It turns out it\u2019s a love story.But instead of chocolate and roses, our lovers share eviscerating others. It\u2019s a short story of a blossoming romance between an Asian-American serial killer and a stripper he kidnapped. Nuclear Lulu and Apocalyptic Montessa do horrible things together but they also love in a very real and fierce way. Their romance is self-consuming and baptized in tears and blood. As melodramatic as it may sound, it\u2019s very well written book that\u2019s not afraid to go to very dark places.Both characters are deeply damaged and went through childhood trauma. Montessa\u2019s relationships were empty and hurtful. She admits that  it was easier to be with a man who wanted to murder her, and would appreciate it than be with a man who would only beat her to death.Lu is a serial killer who loves to make people suffer. It\u2019s his true calling. It\u2019s something he does well. Their relationship evolves quickly and they end up meaning the world to one another. Despite their flaws and craziness Lu and Montessa are endearing. Apocalyptic Montessa and Nuclear Lulu doesn't idealize love. Neither does it try to sell it to you. Love is presented as a violent thing rooted in imperfection. There\u2019s a little world outside a pair. Other people appear but they\u2019re barely sketched. The focus of the story lies elsewhere: in picturing impossible and yet relatable romance with words and sentences. While Mercedes M. Yardley prose is economic, it\u2019s poetic in places, melodramatic in others:\nHe held out his hand. She walked over and took it. Sparks flew. Magic happened. Nuclear reactors melted in joy. The world combusted.\nNot everyone will like this style. I loved it. It\u2019s strong. It delivers feelings pretty well and, in places, sets a bit surreal ambiance. Overall, it was something else. The book is very short and strong. It\u2019s dark and twisted take on the topic of soulmates. Obviously, some moral questions may arise as we start to cheer for a pair of psychotic killers and it\u2019s good to think them through."}, {"userName": "Paige Ellen Stone", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6789258-paige-ellen-stone", "userReview": "It's probably rude to start off by mentioning another author, but here I go. I recently discovered the writings of Laird Barron. At last,something new and different. I ran through his work like lightning and thought I would not find anything that good for a while. Along comes Mercedes M. Yardley and her seductively titled novella, \"Apocalyptic Montessa and Nuclear Lulu: A Tale of Atomic Love.\" I began reading and I was stunned. First of all, her writing is to die for, her style and use of prose is like no other I have read. It is seductive and compelling, hypnotic even.As the tale began, I thought, \"great, my favorite mythic theme, beauty and the beast.\" I actually cheered at Montessa's acceptance of her apparent fate, death at the whim of a serial killer. She baffles her abductor through her absence of abject terror and her refusal to beg for her life. Lulu, or Lu, as he is known at this point in the story, simply doesn't know what to make of this. So, Montessa = Beauty; Lu = Beast. Simple, right. I don't want to retell the whole story here. Through her extraordinary storytelling skills and her beautifully twisted psyche, Ms Yardley unwinds a story in which Lu,the Beast,brings out the Beast in Montessa and she brings our the Beauty in Lulu, as Montessa has now named him. That Yardley accomplishes this while telling the story of two serial killers is a literary feat the likes of which I have never before seen.This is brilliant prose, extraordinary storytelling. Hate, revenge, fear, sorrow, regret, tragedy and triumph are all woven skillfully into this glorious novella. I admit, it is not for the faint of heart, nor for those who fear the darkness in their own souls. It is for anyone who loves superb writing with a taste for the unusual. Think H. Ellison, Robert Bloch, et al. Think about reading something the likes of which you have never read before. I can't wait to get caught up with her other short stories. Her first novel is coming. It can't get here soon enough.Highest recommendation: don't miss this one!"}, {"userName": "Zakk W", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12033660-zakk-w", "userReview": "Lulu and Montessa beat the odds and overcome their differences to find the true depth of love.

Yardley and she has quickly been added to the short list of \"must-read\" authors. Her ability to paint a strikingly gorgeous and painful picture through word is nothing short of awe inspiring. From the first page, this tale is sheathed in a slick duality. It is told under the guise of beauty, only when you take a moment to think about what you've just read is when you're blindsided by just how heavy it is. Like the pairing of opposite colors on the spectrum, It's mentally exciting. Her style reminds me of a Ramsey Campbell or Clive Barker yarn, maybe not as much in style but in the deceptive way that the delivery takes form as character in it's own. A master puppeteer, deceptively showing you what it wants to show you, holding back on what you are not ready for and eschewing that which does not matter. But rest assured that a Yardley tale will teach you a thing or two about what makes you feel, and how you feel it.4.5/5 Check it out.

The story surprised me: while I expected to be steered towards trying to like the characters, I didn't expect to not dislike them at the same time. Make sense? Read it again. Montessa is damaged beyond repair, too damaged to really understand and control herself sometimes. However, her time with Lu gives her hope and respite, and provides the beginning of understanding. Lu, on the other hand, knows he's damaged, and has embraced that state. He's controlled, and in control, until he meets Montessa. Montessa and Lu are the Bonnie & Clyde of horror fiction. Star-crossed / ill-fated, yet somehow finding a red thread of hope and understanding within each other.

It might not make your day, but it'll grow inside you, shake you and leave its taste in yor mouth for a while.So yea, now that I'm done with the book and the review, I'm just going to go sit in a corner and just think about it."}, {"userName": "Brainycat", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3807871-brainycat", "userReview": "Brainycat's 5 \"B\"s :blood: 5boobs: 2bombs: 2bondage: 5blasphemy: 5 Stars : 3 Bechdel Test : FAIL Deggan's Rule : PASS (in spirit if not the letter) Gay Bechdel Test : FAILFull review at booklikes."}, {"userName": "Gabriel", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4775930-gabriel", "userReview": "All of the dark swirling emotions from her short story collection, Beautiful Sorrows, are honed down to razor sharp precision and unwavering focus in this book.

A love so all-consuming that the world would not allow it. You need to read it.

Her voice is so distinct, it transcends simple labels. Her prose is poetic and lyrical, yet never feels flashy or overdone. This novella is the perfect example of that talent. When you can make your readers feel emotional toward a serial killer, never shoving any blatant moral messages in their faces (except for, possibly, love conquering all), you're doing all kinds of things right. Call it horror, call it dark fantasy--call it whatever you want. I just call it another awesome Yardley book. More please."}, {"userName": "Rena Mason", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4740101-rena-mason", "userReview": "Wow! This is a love story like no other I've ever read. And between two killers! I'm a fan of this author's writing style and storytelling, and this novella is a bit on the darker and gruesome side of her other works I've read, but that's not a bad thing. I loved it!
