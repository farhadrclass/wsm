When in exile he revives a letter that his girlfriend in Lagos has been taken by the government and he returns to his home with the mission of freeing her from the dictatorship. On his arrival he find he has been forgotten, by his neighbors and his friends, his guitars stolen from his house, leaving him with only the instrument he carries.The difficulties of those in the arts under a dictatorship can definitely be drawn from this story. The power of music to change and reach out to the people. The amnesia and fear that people learn to live under in order to survive. As Taduno tries to find his girlfriend and make the people remember, as well as to find the voice he seems to have lost, he is presented with a moral dilemma. Does he betray all to save her, or does he betray her by not pursuing the terrible opportunity the President presents to him? I took this quote to heart and it captures much of what this book is saying, \"When the music is silent, you hear the laughter of the tyrant.\"A short book, quick read but with a powerful message."}, {"userName": "Lark Benobi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73768036-lark-benobi", "userReview": "The novel has the simplicity and lyricism of a folk tale and yet it managed to convey, so deeply, the numbness and defilement of human relationships among people living in corrupt authoritarian regimes. The bareness of the prose did not prevent me from experiencing this novel as a devastating indictment of state-sponsored violence. I was upset by it."}, {"userName": "Stacia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3917029-stacia", "userReview": "I sat down & read this one in one sitting. It's a short enough book to do that &, in a way, I think that may be the best way to read this one.It's almost like an allegory, a short morality tale, & a fable mixed together. It was a very good book, imo, simple yet thoughtful, exploring the themes of tyranny & the freedom (or not) to choose your responses. And, if you are choosing, do you choose the better for the individual or for the group? In that respect, it was quite deep as far as thought material & weighed heavily on my heart & mind. This particular tale is set in Nigeria & is apparently somewhat based on history there. Sadly, this kind of conundrum has presented itself way too much in the history of humans & continues to do so routinely to this day.\"His preparations complete, he paused to reflect on his experience as an exile, and he realized that it was far different from anything he had ever heard or read. In exile you live life counting the seconds and minutes and hours, allowing yourself to be consumed by ennui, as indistinct days roll one into another.\"Part of the issue is that a famous musician who lived in exile for months to escape life under the military dictatorship of his country comes home to find that nobody knows him. It's like there is a collective wiping of memory, of free thought TO remember things. I think it's partly a survival instinct to look the other way, not \"see\" things anymore, not \"know\" things. Choosing ignorance in order to survive.\"\"I'm worried that it could be the rest of us who have lost our minds. I'm worried that a man who has lost his mind cannot be as sane as you are. You know so much about us, yet we know nothing about you. Is it possible that we are the ones who have forgotten the past? Honestly, I suspect that could be the case.\"Similarly, later in the story...\"'.... We don't have anything to do with TK anymore, and we don't want anything to do with you and your guitar. When you find TK pass our message to him. We want to live our lives in peace, not pieces.'\"And those caught in a place where they work in a complicit manner to the oppressors, yet still have a conscience buried deep inside....\"And Sergeant Bello could take it no more -- knowing he was against the people, and on the side of evil. And he felt sad knowing that the same people he was against murmur not for their own good, but his as well.\"and\"'Regardless of which side we are on, hope is universal. When you begin to hope, you begin to murmur against that which hinders you. And when you murmur, change is bound to come.'\"Again, the collective memory loss. Involuntary? Voluntary? Both? Erasing a culture erases a people.\"'And then they banned all record shops from selling my music. The army invaded the shops and confiscated all my records. They invaded my house, any house where my records could be found, and they seized every copy of my records. And they burned them all so that not a single copy of any of my records can be found anywhere today. I guess that was when every record of me was erased from your memories. I no longer existed because there was no way I could continue to exist without my music. My music was me, and they took it away from me. That was when I gave up the struggle and went into exile.'\"As our protagonist tries to find himself again...\"But all they heard was the faint music of his guitar. And they did not know that the reason why they did not hear him sing was because he was afraid to hear the sound of his own voice.\"And later,\"What remained of Taduno's conscience died that day, and he sensed that only with the death of his conscience would he be able to sing beautifully once again.\"Do you choose the individual or the whole?\"For a moment, he dwelled on Aroli's words. And then he asked himself: What is the real meaning of love? When is love a crime? He knew the answer to his second question. Love is a crime when you love one person at the expense of the whole world.\"and\"'They can only kill her once,' TK said patiently. 'But if you praise the regime with your music you will be signing the death warrant of millions of people.'\"and\"'.... We must not select those to save and those to condemn to death in the fight against tyranny. We must learn to say \"no\" to tyrants no matter how much they hurt us. That is the only way tyranny can be defeated.'\"Lots of food for thought, but not told in a horribly explicit manner, if that makes sense. I'm am very thankful to have stumbled across this one."}, {"userName": "Faith", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17430801-faith", "userReview": "This is an interesting fable, with some magical realism, about the power of music as a weapon against tyranny. It's also a book about having the courage to make difficult choices. A famous singer/song writer has been forced into exile because of his protest music. He returns to Nigeria and discovers that all memories of him and his music have been erased. His girlfriend has been taken into custody by the government to put pressure on him to make music in praise of the dictator. Taduno's story was very moving and the ending had a lot of impact.

I decided to read this book and it didn't even take me an hour to finish it's so so so short.The story follows Taduno's quest to release his girlfriend Lela from the corrupt hands of the corrupt government. The story has a cloudy flow to it, where there's a race against time feeling to it. For one, no one can remember Taduno, not even the people in power that are looking for him. Which makes it weird, why can't they remember him what magic is at play?When Taduno plays music, it's like he is a wizard, because his songs have the power to mess with the emotions of people and make them listen to him or bow to his wishes.It's a very fictional Lagos, Nigeria there isn't really much depth to the characters and the story is so fleeting and unfortunate, Taduno's fate isn't much of a good one, because he is entangled with the government and he can only have peace if he does as they say, but he knows in doing so he would lose himself.I'm just glad I wasn't alive during the military regime in Nigeria and pray Nigeria never gets ruled by them again."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26130808-cindy", "userReview": "Der Hintergrund von \"Tadunos Lied\" ist ernst, die Machenschaften des Dikators grausam.

The titular guitarist-singer Taduno is stirred from exile by a letter from his imprisoned lover. Returning to Lagos, he finds that no one knows who he is, and the loss of his voice makes it impossible to prove his identity. Much wandering the city ensues as he tried find his producer friend, whom he's hoping can restore his voice. Eventually, he is faced with the prospect of either using his artistic talents to praise the regime, or let his lover die. There are a few interesting scenes scattered here and there, but so much has been written and filmed about the role of an artist in a repressive society that there's not much here that felt vital or fresh to me.

Atogun definitely needs to check up on the 'show don't tell' thing, because, especially when it came to the music and emotion in this story, there was just nothing shown and everything told. We're simply told Taduno is a brilliant musician and his music is like magic and people's hearts melt over and over again, but I never really felt as though Atogun really knew anything about music or found a way to show this. I felt very emotionally disconnected from this book because so much of it didn't make sense, was unbelievable (I had to suspend my disbelief so many times, and I was never fully sure, even at the end, whether or not this was supposed to be a realistic book or not), was repetitive, or was just boring. I didn't really care about anyone in the story, and the only woman in the novel (Taduno's girlfriend) is literally presented as a delicate damsel in distress. Taduno himself is simply annoying. Taduno is the perfect Gary Sue. He's better than good, he's the wisest person there is, he can wallow in love and joy and happiness in prison with his music and touch the hearts of all his guards, everyone who meets him loves him, he has no discernible flaws, and really . . . that's not a person I can be interested or invested in, so this novel really didn't work for me."}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859680-mandy", "userReview": "A famous rebel singer and musician, much loved and acclaimed in his native Nigeria, goes into exile but then feels impelled to return when he gets a letter from his girlfriend hinting that all is not as it should be at home.

The country is Nigeria and ruled by a despot, but the power of his music presents a challenge to the regime and as the people begin to be influenced by and come under the spell of his music Taduno is faced with a stark choice.

Mit seinen regimekritischen Liedern gegen den herrschenden Diktator, hat er diesen gegen sich aufgebracht.Doch urpl\u00f6tzlich erreicht ihn ein Brief seiner Geliebten Lela, die ihm schreibt, dass es in seiner Heimatstadt immer schlimmer wird und er bleiben soll, wo er ist.Leider bewirkt sie damit genau das Gegenteil, sie entfacht Tadunos Heimweh nur umso mehr! Allen Gefahren zum Trotz, reist er in seinem Heimat, wo er feststellen muss, dass sich niemand -nicht einmal seine Nachbarn und engsten Freunde- an ihn erinnert!! Wie konnte das nur geschehen? Oder wird er verr\u00fcckt?Noch schlimmer trifft es ihn jedoch zu erfahren, dass Lela von der Regierung entf\u00fchrt wurde, um ihn in die Finger zu bekommen...Trotz allen \u00c4ngsten und Gefahren macht Taduno sich auf, um das Liebste zu retten, was er im Leben besitzt. Aber wird er Lela wirklich befreien k\u00f6nnen?Allem voran muss ich wohl sagen, dass es sich bei diesem Buch nicht um einen typischen Roman handelt, wie man ihn in der Regel in den H\u00e4nden h\u00e4lt. Es erz\u00e4hlt eher eine Geschichte. Eine Geschichte \u00fcber Mut, Hoffnung und Liebe, aber auch unsch\u00f6nere Dinge wie Verrat und Angst. Das passiert in einem tiefgr\u00fcndigen, stellenweise poetischen Stil voller Phantasie und Bildnissen, der mir pers\u00f6nlich sehr gut gefallen hat. Das sollte man vielleicht vor dem Lesen wissen, sonst fragt man sich vermutlich, wie Musik das Leben eines Landes ver\u00e4ndern kann, oder wie es m\u00f6glich ist, dass sich nicht einmal sein bester Freund an Taduno erinnert. Aber hey, zweifelt nie an der Macht der Musik ;)F\u00fcr alle die sich auf eine solche Geschichte einlassen, kann ich nur sagen, dass es sich wirklich lohnt, Taduno auf seiner Reise zu begleiten. Gegen Unterdr\u00fcckung, Hass, Angst und f\u00fcr die Freiheit, Freundschaft und Liebe. Ich empfand die Geschichte dieses Mannes, auf der Suche nach sich selbst, seinem Weg und der L\u00f6sung auf die Frage, was richtig und was falsch ist, als sehr bewegend und tief.

It's written like a fairy or folk tale - or maybe more like a legend, or parable. Once I imagined that someone was telling me the story out loud, I understood the tone. It is interesting that the setting is clearly stated to be Nigeria, but there are no other specific political details like the name of the dictator. Appropriately for a folk tale, this gives it a universal quality while still placing it in a particular culture. While the main character was compared to Fela Kuti in the jacket blurbs (one of the reasons I picked it up), there aren't many similarities beyond Taduno being a Nigerian musician who inspires a politically oppressed nation. I liked the touch of magical realism - with no explanation ever given, at the beginning of the book everyone has forgotten who Taduno is. He is a well-known musician in Nigeria, but everyone including his friends and neighbors has no memory of him or their past together. Not coincidentally, this happened while Taduno had expatriated for an unnamed Western country. Only his girlfriend knows who he is, and her mysteriously delivered letters are his motivation for returning and taking action."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081843-amy", "userReview": "This novel is thought provoking and entertaining, relaying a story that will stay with the reader long beyond the book\u2019s end.

This is not often an easy task when employing surrealism in literature. This book will appeal to fans of Haruki Murakami, having some stylistic similarities. Readers may also gain insight or additional understanding of the inner workings of a military dictatorship. A highly recommended quick read.As Atogun\u2019s debut novel, Taduno\u2019s Song is a real winner. This novel takes place in a present day African military dictatorship. Taduno is a renowned musician who returns home after months away to find the country has forgotten him entirely, save for his voice.

Unless I'm missing some allegory, the idea of the best musician in the country being morally perfect rang a bit hollow, along with the story, that no-one could remember anything about the greatest musician that ever lived other than his voice. The characters were a bit simplistic too, neatly put into good, bad and too ignorant to know better. Fortunately when they heard his guitar their evil thoughts went away, and the tension was whether he would save his love or condemn the people to be led by a tyrant.That's not to say the book was entirely without merit, but the fictional world didn't make me feel that I had truly been transported there, feeling a little generic and short of detail, and the whole book was focused on actions rather than descriptions, which helped moved the story along in many ways but left it flat in others.It was the right length and an easy read, but disappointingly it wasn't particularly memorable."}, {"userName": "Thurston Hunger", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/270341-thurston-hunger", "userReview": "Love how this book sets up, an exiled musician returns to his village and finds he's a victim of \"reverse amnesia.\" No one remembers him, though the lore of his enchanting (and uplifting/challenging) songs still echo.
