Sadly, I was mistaken. The book was filled with typographical errors (publisher's issue, in my view). So, that was annoying. But the more irritating part was that the book was more of a modern day Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys mystery. Personally, I believe these books should be relocated from the mystery section of bookstores to the young adults section. I guess I should not be too harsh about this series as the author has published 13 books, I believe. So, someone out there likes them. That person just does not happen to be me. Unfortunately, I picked up an additional Aunt Dimity book when I purchased this one. So, I'll be reading that one at some point.

They are growing painfully formulaic, and what sympathy I once had for Lori is about gone. She's become an idiot, and Bill should dump her into a sanatorium for an extended stay.I may pick up some others when they're on the cut-out shelves and cheaper than paperbacks, but unless Atherton suddenly starts producing plots that make suspending disbelief a little more tempting, I may just go immerse myself in science fiction for a while."}, {"userName": "Barbara \u2605", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1968285-barbara", "userReview": "I enjoyed this one much more than the last one I read.

This is such a sweet, fun enjoyable series, and I get the next Aunt Dimity when I just want something light and unique with a bit of a mystery. Nancy Atherton never disappoints me!Having survived her near-death encounter with a crazed mad-man on a secluded Scottish island, Lori is back in Finch but dealing with severe post-traumatic stress disorder. Troubled by nightmares, terrified of thunderstorms and barely able to function, Bill decides a drastic change of scenery is needed.Lori, the twins and nanny-extraordinaire Anneliese are sent off to Bluebird Colorado to vacation in the mountain \"cabin\" of one of Bill's clients. Envisioning a shack with an out-house, Lori is delighted to discover a spectacular mountain get-away with every luxury one could imagine.Lori, Anneliese and the boys take to clean mountain air and horses and exercise, but before long, the local townspeople start telling Lori tales about how the cabin is cursed. Given Lori's nightly conversations with Aunt Dimity, who can always sense any evil in any building immediately if it is present, Lori discounts the stories as small-town supersition. But odd things keep happening, and before long Lori's off and investigating, despite all recommendations against it.This was a fun change of scenery for Lori and family, and there is a clever connection made between the folks of Bluebird and those back home in England. I figured out what was going on slightly before the book revealed it, but the Aunt Dimity books are never about the mystery, as much as they are about beloved characters that you cannot wait to revisit and catch up with in each new story. All the characters you love in ther series are here, and as always some characters specific to this story are introduced to add favour and spice."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3850112-stephen", "userReview": "I picked this book, and another Aunt Dimity, up in a sale and had never hear do her. I was pleasantly surprised by both books and enjoyed their quite different gentler mysteries. The Aunt Dimity character is certainly an original.I would recommend this series of books to anyone who wants a light entertaining read with no gore or distress, though there was a touch of scary spookiness in both the books, the other was Aunt Dimity: Snowbound: Snowbound (Aunt Dimity Mystery), that I have read.Aunt Dimity Goes West"}, {"userName": "Heather L", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/431357-heather-l", "userReview": "Another good addition to the series.

I read to about page 80 but I'm so sick of Lori's extramarital wanderings that I had to let it go. Lori's crush on 21 year old Toby is not cute, funny, or endearing. It's disgusting---for many reasons, but most obviously because this whole vacation was her faithful husband Bill's idea in the first place. We're not dealing with a silly school girl...isn't she like 40 or something? Please. Any concessions I gave Lori in the last book---one I actually enjoyed---have now been revoked. In this story, Lori has found a \"clone\" for every Finch person in those she meets in Colorado. I think introducing a clone for her husband is going a little too far---especially since the author has created these people as church-going people of faith. Ugh. I think I need another break from this series."}, {"userName": "Karen A.

On the other hand, there's a set of quite unrealistic and unexplained facts (though Atherton leaves open the possibility that Lori exaggerates them) that weren't crucial to the story.As is often the case, we have new interesting characters joining the main series characters, as well as more well-described settings. The mystery is resolved nicely, with no deus ex machina element.

She still jumps to conclusions, but they're of a less cynical sort. She's usually quick to acknowledge when she's been rude or presumptuous. And though she's never been one to shy away from possible danger, she's now proven herself as quite fierce when the situation calls for it. She and the sensible, insightful Dimity continue to make a grand team, whether at home at Finch or while visiting its Colorado doppelganger, Bluebird.There were many chuckles in this installment thanks to Toby, a sarcastic young caretaker, and Lori's rambunctious twins. The laughs bracketed the customary foray into history - this time focusing on Bluebird's gold-rush experiences. Atherton remains so adept at making the past come alive, her vivid descriptions brimming with humanity and forcing us to care about every character, whether alive or dead.I must also acknowledge Atherton's uncanny ability to sense precisely what the series needs to prevent it from becoming stagnant or tiresome. I'm just as interested now as I was at the onset, with only a few rocky moments in-between.

Aunt Dimity Goes West is not my favorite of the series, however. Maybe that's because we move out of the English countryside and into an area that I know much better, so the stereotypes are more jarring and the setting less exotic. Also, Ms. Atherton brings in an additional ghost (or whatever Aunt Dimity is), and I find that stretches my willing suspension of disbelief to the edge of breaking. Too many mystical elements and she loses me.But the unfolding of the story with just the right amount of humor, interpersonal stuff, and suspense/danger is pretty well on target. We can laugh with Lori at her own overreactions, and have a good time worrying about the mysterious dangers she and the twins face without ever really losing any sleep over it. And we get the comfortable and comforting ending we expect.My husband and I often refer to the mysteries and light fiction we read as \"brain candy.\" But books like the \"Aunt Dimity\" series are more along the lines of comfort foods--things that can make you feel that all's right with the world."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/949924-maria", "userReview": "I loved the descriptions of Colorado, but the doppelganger bit got old real fast, especially with the names being so similar. Like most people, I don't like to think that there is someone else out there that close to another without being a twin. A unknown twin would have served the plot line better. The history, the introduction of the school teacher who had been dead for a hundred years, and the resolution of the current mystery were wonderful. The twins, as usual, were a treat. I loved their calm use of bad language when they did not have the least idea of what they were saying. So typical. The other thing I didn't like was the re-introduction of Lori being attracted to Toby, a guy fifteen years her junior. At this point, it just got ridiculous. The Auerbachs, who never actually enter the story other than through hearsay, were wonderful characters, and I was very happy that James and his wife ended up with them and that they did not sell their Colorado property. Hopefully Toby will come back into the story at some future date, but without the underlying attraction. Good grief.

Lori soon learns the site is supposed to be cursed, due to a long ago mining accident, and that the Auerbach family hasn\u2019t used the cabin since Christmas and left hurriedly then. Lori solves the mystery of the mine collapse, along with a current day puzzle that left her family in danger.

But then, I also love to watch Murder She Wrote, and in my imagination, Aunt Dimity looks like Angela Lansbury and that Lori is a younger Angela, playing Jessica Fletcher's British cousin Emma. If that made sense to you, and you read these books, you understand why I enjoy the series. Here's the thing, though. I was reading, getting the same general happy vibe I get reading the latest Aunt Dimity, and yet something was missing. Where was Reginald in this book? Dear, beloved Reginald was missing from the cover. A friend of mine who works for the publishers even told me that she doesn't read Aunt Dimity, but even she always looks for the little, pink rabbit. The change in the cover art is definitely a hamper on the novel, because it's so distracting.

She fears the worst but is happily surprised by the expansive and homey cabin as well as the assistant and guide hired to help them during their time there. Many of the inhabitants of the small village eerily remind her of the inhabitants of her home village in England with the exception of one or two.

The fact that her friends who also know these people didn't see the resemblance tell us a great deal about Lori Shepherd. Lori's attraction to the younger man is ridiculous as well. I really want Bill to stick around more because he acts as a restraining influence on Lori and she definitely couldn't flirt as much if Bill was there.The final point is that Annaliese does all the work and takes care of the boys so that Lori can behave in her less than stellar way.
