At 16, she is a university freshman and having awful dorm problems. In fact, in the first chapter, she is beaten by a group of mean girls, thrown down the stairs, and warned that she would be killed next time she is seen around the campus. She is unconscious for a while, and when she is found by another student, nobody calls the police. Even the campus doctor who checks Claire's many bruises, split lip and sprained ankle, doesn't ask any questions. Claire's solution to this life-threatening problem is to find another place to live, off campus. She finds an ad in a local paper in which 3 students are looking for a roommate. The 3 are nice people and they agree to take in Claire at least temporarily. In the new house she is told that the town they all live - Morganville - is run by vampires. The next day a cop comes to Claire's new residence, looking for her. Apparently, this cop is send by the mean girls who just the other day abused Claire and she is in a big-big trouble (what?), therefore, Claire's roommates tell her, nobody can know where she is, she can't get outside or go to school, or she will be caught and killed! You know, a reasonable person would ask, why wouldn't Claire go back home if her life is in such an immediate danger (please, don't bother telling me - \"But she is such a dedicated student! She wants to prove her independence to her parents!\" - I am not buying it)? And why people agree to live in this backward, vampire-run town at all? But nobody in this book does. At this point all I could do was throw by hands up in the air and give up on this drivel. However, I am guessing, if you can tolerate this dumbness, you might end up enjoying the book. Many people I know did. I personally have a very low tolerance for stupid."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5103051-megan", "userReview": "Alright, so let's do this hmm?

The main character is an idiot, and all plot development in the story line requires that you suspend your disbelief about said idiocy. What makes it hard, though, is that Claire Danvers is branded as a \"genius.\" She's sixteen - \"sixteen and a half,\" she'll be quick to tell you - and yet, got accepted to Harvard, MIT, Yale, and all these other great schools, but her parents don't want her to be far from the house (dafuq), so they send her to a school that's a cross between a party school and a community college (I repeat, dafuq), in the middle of Morganville, Texas. \"You can transfer, later,\" is the argument.Claire immediately cheeses off one the \"popular\" girls, named Monica, who is basically a cross between Joffrey from Game of Thrones and Regina from Mean Girls. She's one of those \"mean girls\" who hangs out with a clique of her own (Claire calls them the Monickettes, which is just one example of her brilliance). She's also a studied psychopath who thinks it's perfectly okay to beat people up, attack them with beakers of acid, and then later set them on fire. You're probably wondering where the adults are in this book, because that's what I was wondering, but Claire (stupidly) lies to her parents and her friends about her safety, over and over, and a code of non-interference is built into the rules of Morganville, which is run by vampires, so no adults are ever going to look out for her safety.How convenient.\n\nClaire ends up staying with these \"cool\" \"alternative\" kids in a place called The Glass House, which is amusing for two reasons: 1) The Glass House (2001) is the name of a so-bad-it's-good horror thriller and 2) it is incredibly dated with what passes for cool. Not only is the \"it's so lame to be smart\" thing outdated, but Claire's new reject friends are a Goth, a musician, and a punk-ish tough guy. It's so early 2000s that it almost physically hurts, you guys. Her new friends tell her about how the town is run (by vampires) and this is arguably the most interesting aspect of the story, because I thought Caine did vampire politics in a relatively interesting way. The vampires own the city, and the cops. Important humans have Protection in the form of bracelets (basically: do not bite) and can carry over to family members, but like health insurance, expire when the wearer turns 18 (yet another reason this story is dated - thanks, Obamacare!). The best way to avoid being bitten is to stay off their radar, play by the rules, be home before curfew, and oh, yeah, don't invite them in.That's actually another thing I liked about GLASS HOUSES: Caine uses traditional vampire lore. Garlic and crosses repel vampires. They can't be out in the sunlight unless they're very old or very powerful. They can't cross your threshold unless they've been invited in. They kill to feed. Make no mistake, these are the evil kinds of vampires that your mom grew up with, and honestly, my personal favorite kind. The world building was something I had absolutely zero problems with, and I kept thinking to myself what a shame it was that the main character was so freaking stupid.I just couldn't get on board with Claire. Her friends were okay, but their dialogue was very wooden and they didn't have much in the way of personality, either. Even though it's written in the third person, there's a lot of annoying asides that are supposed to be Claire's \"voice\" and it's very annoying - more so, because never once does she display that \"intelligence\" that got her accepted into all those good universities. What's wrong with writing a female character who's intelligent and cunning? Why does she have to be a vapid, spineless victim who does nothing but remind people that she's almost seventeen, cry, get herself almost murdered by at least three different people, and cry some more? And she's so dumb. This is a character who could be around the corner from the guy with a chainsaw, and be all, \"How delightful. A swarm full of friendly, happy bees have come to bring me honey! :D\"I'm a little afraid to pick up the next book, but I bought books 1 & 2 bundled so now I feel obligated.

I've always been a lovey dovey vampire lover as opposed to the GRR, I'M AN EVIL BASTARD kind. But, as it turns out....I fell really hard for this book. And, instead of sexy bites shared between vampire lovers (or, rather, a human AND vamp), we had the scary as shit psycho vampires. Honestly, I was disappointed at first. I mean, really. Who doesn't like a little neck biting action? WHO I ASK, WHO?! But as the story progressed, it gave me something....a little more.\n-and Dad, who was glowering at Shane in the background, was as tall and twice as broad. \u201cIs it him?\u201d Dad asked. \u201cDid he get you into trouble?\u201d \u201cNot me,\u201d Shane said. \u201cI\u2019ve just got that kind of face.\u201d\nI won't say it wouldn't be a cool future twist (I'm looking at you, book two *wink*), but, for now, I'm satisfied. Why am I satisfied, you ask? Well, I'll tell you. Instead of sexy neck play between two lovahs, we have a million other things: Mean girls who are actually VERY mean, evil vampires that cause a lot of heroic romantic suspense, not one, but TWO sexy boys, and a cast of four characters that live in a house together, doing everything they can to protect one another. Oh, and there's an EPIC twist somewhere in this story-I like. I approve.For me to love books that are....well....paranormal, the author better be hella creative. In this case?? She was. And I even thought it was a BIT more addictive than my other vamp series I'm reading...but only by a hair! To me, that's amazing. I LOVE Evernight-I love the atmosphere, the boy, the main girl (most of the time), but sometimes it's a bit lighter and not as intense in the writing area. I love that, but starting this series certainly made my heart pound in ways that are completely out of this world.This book was creepy as shit, but it doesn't really kick up the scary SCARINESS until book two. Oh yeah, I'm running through these vamp series like candy, so, yeah, I'm extremely behind on reviews FYI. These poor books aren't getting NEAR the reviews they deserve, I realize. But, I digress, my point is this: These books are a lot more adult. They aren't really......mature, per se, but they do border that fine line where you're like, shit, are they really going to burn this guy alive? And are they honestly going to kill off one of my favorite characters brutally? I really can't say....and I kind of dig it.Now, okay, I wouldn't be me if I didn't defend my darling males. You've got Shane and Michael. Michael is who everyone seems to like. I guess I did, too? But that's only because I let reviews influence me. From the very beginning it's clear that Shane is totally into Claire and he is going to be uber protective of her. I love this. So, in essence, I LOVE Shane. He is nothing but sweet and kind and funny from the very beginning-And when things get serious, so does he. So...what's not to like? I swear, people lol. Who cares!!! But. Anyway. Moving on. Michael is great, too, but....I don't see the large hype for him??? Other than loving him as a main character-I do, too. I guess I'm just still trying to figure that one out. Not trying to dwell on it. \nShe didn\u2019t look up. He came a step closer, and his bare feet and sweatpants came into her vision. \u201cClaire. You\u2019ve got to promise me.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not some little kid. And I\u2019m not your sister.\u201d He laughed, low in his throat. \u201cOh, yeah. That, I know. But I don\u2019t want to see you get hurt again.\u201d\nOH OH OH!!!! And, okay, I must say-these might be some of my favorite kissing scenes EVER. Or, at least, in a long long time. I just am extremely enamored with how she writes the exchanges-sexy, sweet, swoony, and then there's how she explains the body? I don't know...I just was very attracted to the way she described something as beautifully simple as kissing. It's like authors forget how to, you know?? I have very high hopes for, ahem, future endeavors hehe.God this review is so weird. I'm sorry guys-I'm sitting at work and going back and forth between work and writing this sad excuse for a review, so that's likely it. I'd rather post something rather than nothing at all so, well....here you go. All I can really say is I adore this series very much and I am EXTREMELY excited to see what's next for my darling Claire and Shane-I love Eve and Michael, too, but babies first!!! I think a lot of people are missing out on this-Yes, it's silly. Yes, they get into some crazy situations....but it never once felt cheesy. So. Um. SCORE. That is all. **************Shockingly..I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK!! I've been waiting FOREVER to try and I am so glad I waited until my comeback (from being sick) for my month of vampires....Though, these vamps are pretty mean lol And I ADORE Shane.

For me, it is a really big shame that i did not find it sooner.There is a lot that i could say about this first book in the series, and believe me i would if i could, but i would probably never stop talking and i would go over the word limit for reviews.First of all the story kicked off to a really good start. It was a thrilling and exciting first chapter. When i opened the book i saw that the chapters were like 20-30 pages long. For me, i was really worried. It seems that all the books i read that have really long chapters, end up being really long, dull, boring books. It's like a jinx to me. But this book seems to of broken that pattern. But although they seems long, they were very fast to read. The is a lot going on in the book, and something excting happens in every chapter...it made me keep on reading.Secondly the character's. How many books have i read and not liked the main character?- To many, but there are also ones i hate. But in all honesty, Claire is a likable character. They all are really. Sure, she can be stupid at times, but that's just who she is, and it is that, that makes her so realistic and interesting character.I can see there is going to be a romance somewhere along the line, but it's not in the book as much as some book do. When it's in your face all the time. This book has the romance, but it is off to the side, keeping up with the storyline alongside. It's more about the problem rather then the romance, which don't get me wrong, i love a good romance book as much as the next person, it's just not made a big deal ofThe storyline is great, the style of writing is wonderful and the characters are loveable! What's not to love? It ended on a cliffhanger which is really annoying as i don't have the next book(s) yet, but i will soon .Happy reading..."}, {"userName": "Jo \u2605The Book Sloth\u2605", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13870608-jo-the-book-sloth", "userReview": "3.5 Good To Be Different StarsI first read the Morganville Vampires series about four years ago, at the beginning of my experience with Paranormal and Urban-Fantasy. At the time I though Twilight and The House of Night were THE SHIT so this wasn't my favorite because it's much darker. But now, 4 years later, I still like this when I can't even stand to read the first book of the other two series.The Morganville Vampires series has its problems. The writing needs a little effort to like and Claire is annoying as hell at the beginning and the 4 main characters are all a kind of immature, hormonal, wrecking ball.At the first 30% of the book you can clearly see that intelligence isn't always accompanied by mature and smart decisions. Claire is supposed to be this uber-intelligent kid who got accepted in colleges like MIT and Yale at 16 but since her parents wouldn't allow her so far from home she ended up in a \"Party-College\" in Texas. All that is good but then Claire starts making all the bad decisions her parents worried about. When she gets bullied and pushed down a flied of stairs(which could have left her with a broken neck) instead of calling her parents, or going to the police(not that it would have done her much good in Morganville but she didn't know that yet), she tries to find somewhere off campus to live. When she goes to the Glass House to interview for the room she meets a bunch of crazy kids and instead of running as fast as she can and calling her parents, she spends the night.And then despite the fact that a crazy girl actually tried to kill her she goes to school and isn't even particularly careful. TSTL doesn't begin to describe it. But things get better after a point...\nWhat makes this book special:\nIn a time when vampires are the best thing after Brad Pitt and David Beckam, Rachel Caine avoids the cliche and tried methods and she doesn't romanticize her vampires. Vampires in Morganville are the bad guys, the monsters lurking in the dark. And you know what? That's freaking GREAT! Vampires see humans as food and the cattle isn't supposed to fall in love with the wolf. Don't get me wrong, I love a good Vampire Love Story as much as the next girl but it's nice to have something different once in a while.We have a group of four friends that haven't all slept, kissed, made out with one another and they don't want to. Who everyone is attracted to becomes clear fast and for once not every guy in the neighborhoof is in love with the heroine. Eve, the actually cool friend, has her guy. Yes, the friend isn't some irrelevant character that isn't as awesome as the heroine. She is just as important and just as awesome.There is no slut-shaming. We have the mean-girls, AKA Monica and her friends, and there is much hate going on between them but it has nothing to do with how many guys Monica has been with or how short her skirt is or if she wears too much make-up at school. Claire hates Monica because Monica is a psychopathic bitch who actually tries to kill her, not steal her boyfriend or mock her clothing.So all in all this book is really good. I though of upping the rating to 4 but I know some of the next books deserve it more so I won't."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "Some might really like the story, but there were too many times the plot read as if it was tossed together like a bad salad & cheap tricks were used to get our heroine in & out of trouble. Worse, new issues & fixes magically appear/disappear, while parents conveniently do the same. Worst of all, the end is a super cliff hanger, the kind that screams \"Read my next book or you're doomed to never know how it turns out.\" It's a shame. The book had some redeeming features & could have been a good story. It just wasn't constructed or told very well. Some of the trimmings were truly imaginative, but I doubt I'll look to hard for any other books by her. I was hoping this was an early book, but it seems that she's prolific enough that this is a pen name. Her forte seems to be YA novels, so maybe that's why I don't care for this as much. If I run across another, I'll probably read it to see if I like it any better, so she didn't completely turn me off."}, {"userName": "Keryl Raist", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4349859-keryl-raist", "userReview": "So let's talk a little about young adult paranormal fiction. Let's talk a little about suspension of disbelief.For the fantasy writer, suspension of disbelief is your best friend. Your job as an author is to do such a good job creating your world so your reader thinks, \"Vampires, werewolves, things that go bump in the night, sure, I buy it!\"There are lots of ways to go about doing this, but part of the bedrock of a good set up is that it's completely believable. Part of what makes good horror and good fantasy so compelling is that the non-fantastic parts feel real.To do this the introduction to your world has to have an internal and consistent logic. It has to make sense. If you toss the reader out of the reality of your world before you even get to the fantastic/spooky stuff, you've achieved EPIC FAIL.For example: try to imagine the first episode of the X-files with a twenty-two-year-old, gum snapping, blonde in five inch heels and a tiny tank top instead of the lovely Gillian Anderson in the role of Scully. Most of us would stop watching there, because we can't suspend our disbelief far enough to wrap our minds around the idea of that woman as a doctor/FBI agent.And now to tie this to Glass House. Claire, our main character, is a sixteen-year-old wunderkind, who whipped through high school in two years (Although she tells us she got there a year early and ended a year soon, which adds up to three years of high school and two years of middle school, but hey, who's counting? Oh yeah, Claire, who told us she did it in two years... How smart is this girl again?) and is now in college. Alas, because her parents are criminally stupid (and apparently enjoy setting fire to money) they sent her to Texas Prairie University, after allowing her to apply to MIT, Yale, Harvard, (and a slew of other high power schools) and getting her acceptance letters to said schools. Apparently they want to keep their sixteen-year-old baby close to home, but living in the dorm of a notorious party school. See at this point I'm already out of the story. I did finish high school a year early. Guess what? You can't do that without mommy and daddy's help, which means mom and dad have to be on board with this whole getting a good education thing. Here's another thing, Mom and Dad are not going to pay the money ($75 for an application to Harvard alone) to apply to all those schools if they have no intention of letting their little girl attend those schools. And lets wrap this up with this idea: if you want your baby to be close because you're feeling protective of her, you are not going to let her live in the dorms of a party school! In the modern world, if mom and dad want you close after you've graduated high school, they can do this wonderful thing known as let you live at home and take courses online. The entire MIT catalog is available online. I'm sure some sort of situation could have been worked out that didn't involve dropping their child in fratland because it's closer to home than MIT.Here's where the discussion of YA comes into play. There's a problem almost all YA books have to deal with: how to get a young person into situations of danger and adventure without Mom and Dad jumping into play to keep them safe. In real life, most kids have the sort of parents who are actually trying to do well by them. In the YA world there are gobs of orphans, boarding schools, and criminally absent parents because they're needed to make the plot work. So, the author wants a plot where Claire has to deal with human adversaries and supernatural ones. For whatever reason the author wants Claire to be sixteen. Sending her off to college early was an interesting twist on boarding school, and opens the potential for living off campus and getting into more contact with the supernatural baddies. She made Claire super smart because that increases friction with the human baddies. This book was written around 2008. It appears to be set around 2008 as well. The level of bullying Claire takes at both high school and college would easily get both institutions sued into bankruptcy. And in the post Columbine/Virginia Tech world, one might think that possibly, if you are being assaulted by the other students, the kind of violence that involves being tossed down a flight of stairs and left unconscious, that possibly someone would call the cops. Just maybe. But of course, no one does anything like that, giving Claire the motivation to move out of the dorm, and into her new home with her new roommates. We didn't even get to the vampires, and I already don't believe this story. In fact, unless they're pink and sparkly (which I've heard isn't true about this book) I believe the vampires more than I do the set up for this book. The entire set up is a series of glowing neon plot devices for the purpose of putting the main character into the situation author wants her in. There is nothing subtle or elegant about the first few chapters of this book. Nothing that shows any real desire to engage in serious world building on the part of the author. In short, it's lazy, and has done nothing to make me want to learn more about what comes next.And so, Congratulations Glass House! Welcome to your shiny new spot on my Did Not Finish List."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/333473-ashley", "userReview": "For anyone looking for good, brainless, PG-13 rated vampire fun, this is probably the book for you. The author has a straightforward writing style and tells a straightforward story about an unpopular girl who gets the short end of the stick in a town ruled by vampires, until she makes some oh my god like totally cool and hottt friends. (Yes, \"hot\" needs three t's--one for each friend.)The book has a slightly juvenile tone, which is ironic since the main character--a brainiac who is sixteen years old and in college--spends much of the book insisting that she's not a little kid. I feel like a lot of the events weren't really thought out and were there to move the story along without really considering the repercussions. It's kind of like how, in Harry Potter, Harry always managed to get away scot-free--and sometimes even with a congratulatory pat on the head--in spite of all the times he ignored rules or authority to save the world/his friends/stuff. Except that this book doesn't even go that far. Eventually, I kind of just gave up all hope for at least some bit of realism.Long story short, not all that great for a first book, but I've been told the series gets better, so I'll give the second book a try."}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3603005-amber", "userReview": "Wow!

She's 16, nearly 17 which she likes to remind people.

Upon her arrival at the Glass House, she meets her said roommates Shane, Michael and Eve. Life starts to get real complicated being in Morganville and the people in the town are on the creapy side. Our protag. Claire, is a smart and determined little thing and she finds that life is nothing what it seems. She is faced with the ugly truth about life in Morganville and with the help of her new roommates they battle together to stay alive.The writing was easy to follow and didn't lead you astray. It keeps you in suspense and the story line flows so you get pulled into it. I just love the characters, even the secondary characters.

There wasn\u2019t much room to get any worse, but that\u2019s another story.As much as I hated the initial setting, there were quite a few things that I appreciated later on.

Happy day!Claire\u2019s three roommates are cool and, again, you might not believe this but, one of them is a GIRL and she\u2019s still cool. Happier day!After getting past the lame excuses of how Claire found herself in Morganville (and remained there as for that matter), the plot became interesting, atmospheric and surprisingly dark with lots of action and some twists that I didn\u2019t see coming. There\u2019s a sweet love story in there (maybe two) and I really liked the way it was developed. Took me a while to get into the writing. As soon as the plot took shape though I had no problem with it. Overall, there were elements that I liked and parts that I didn\u2019t. That's 3 stars."}, {"userName": "Emily (Obsessed Reader)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6145238-emily-obsessed-reader", "userReview": "That was so much fun, I seriously loved it.

But after I met this girl in Goodreads she recommended a lot of young adult paranormal books and I was like Huh?, no idea of the books she mentioned.I met her last December, face-to-face, and I'm glad she include one of her vampire books. No doubt I grab it and hide it, I know nobody is interested in reading the book except me, the girl and the other girl. Yes, both girls, I don't know why they liked to read this kind of books.This is better than Twilight, in my own opinion. First (1) I find it more realistic, I want the old tradition of vampires not the sparkling vampires. Although the author added some additional new formed vampire facts that I find it ridiculous. (Can't remember it anymore.) Second, (2) She included a ghost in the story, it's kinda weird but I find it interesting. Third, (3) No hardcore romance. Lastly, (4) I can relate to the protagonist of the book always being bullied by others. Don't pity me and I don't like somebody will look at me that I have major major problem in life.Claire Danver a first year student of TPU been bullied by bad girls called the Moniketes. (Almost the books that I've read bout college thing, they always have this protagonist that always been bullied, a nerd or something. Have they ever think of changing that concept?) They are the queen bee of the school, like a bitch modeling there ugly bellies in the hallway as if they looked beautiful. So Claire, decided to find a new place, rules are rules, students who are below 18 or 20 are not allowed to find a new apartment or room outside campus. But Claire can't take it anymore, so she entered this weird house called Glass' House and met Eve, Shane and Michael. Eve, is a gothic girl who works in a bar and had this mysterious co-worker, Oliver. Shane, an experiment vampire who had a crush on Claire. While Michale, the owner of the house and a ghost, he usually the one who protects the place and he works as the Protector.They have been chased by the ugly vampires and the ugly Moniketes who are unbearable because of there spoiled attitude because of the lost book which contained the secrets of the vampires. Glass Houses.The things I hate about this books is that the author always makes the character mysterious until the middle end of the story and it makes you busy thinking of the characters than reading the story. Like Shane and Oliver, you thought both of them are just simple characters or supporting ones but they had big roles in the ending.I thought the Glass' house looks like the house above. It was walled with mirror and windows. Don't blame me guys, but it was the author's fault, I don't know that it was Michael's surname. But I want to have one of those glass houses.Rating - Glass Houses by Rachel Caine, 2 Sweets and wishing those vampires with prosperous days of garlic and chili. (Not bad for those people who really likes to try books that are far from there normal reading list. I recommend this to people who likes to read urban fanstasy, swear you wont regret it.

However, do not get me wrong I enjoyed the book and the colorful cast of Claire, Shane, Michael and Eve and the turmoil that seems to find them.It took me forever to locate this series. I was shocked to find this series in the YA section of my local library. Everyone that had recommended the series to me was adult. I was expecting something completely different. After reading the first Chapter, I was shocked; I just cannot get over how they treat this young woman in the first 10 pages alone. This goes way beyond playground bulling. It is awful. Moreover, this poor 16-year-old child has to face this abuse alone.I was disappointed in the narrative style of the book. It bugs me when it is a third person\u2019s point of view then moves to a firsthand recollection. All while thinking about this was the fact that the doctors at the clinic just let Claire\u2019s injuries go without a second thought. Then, Claire parents. What was the deal with them not wanting to believe that she was hurt? Hell I am a mother, I am sure I would have hit the roof and that bitch being over 18\u2026 I would have reacted first thought second. Yet, her parents\u2026what the hell? It reminds me of people who have a killer dog and it attacks their child and then they say \u2018but they love each other, he has never bitten before except in playful matter.\u2019 They are just the type who does not deserve to be parents and neither do Claire\u2019s parents. At least Michael, Shane and Eve offered her an outlet away from Monica. Where her dumbass parents want to thrust her back. Oh my I need to stop ranting before everyone thinks I did not enjoy the book. I did however. I almost gave up on it until Claire\u2019s hand went straight through Michael and he disappeared. I had to keep reading just to find out what Michael was and how the others would take it. Curiosity was what drew me into the story. The plot was not a dramatic and elusive. Therefore, I enjoyed a mindless entertaining read. I look forward to the series.My absolute favorite and will read again and again. I strongly recommend! It has outstanding qualities. The characters are wonderful and surprising and multi-dimensional. The writing is luring, engaging, and well-crafted enough to keep me interested from cover to cover and beyond. The plot is astonishing with twists and turns weaved into a well thought and planned story. There\u2019s no pretense and romance was well balanced and done entirely correctly with properly distributed amounts of hints, behaviors and incredible, undeniable chemistry. Predictability is at an all-time low. With the exception of series based books that follow the same path but are just as good. \nOverall, Favorite, must read again, recommend!!!"}, {"userName": "Rachel Reads Ravenously", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14514998-rachel-reads-ravenously", "userReview": "[ I felt Claire and Michael had more of a romantic connection than Claire and Shane, but I guess I'll see where this series goes  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2299764-victoria", "userReview": "Wow, what a beginning. This story, these characters; they've totally hooked me. It is another vampire story, but it doesn't seem rehashed to me at all. Maybe it was the characters, the creepy twists, or just the fantastic narrative voice. Claire Danvers is having a heck of a time at her crummy dorm. A smart, ordinary girl trying to rough it at her Texas college away from home, she is constantly harassed, sometimes to the point of serious injury, by the vicious cliques of popular girls. So when she finds an ad for three housemates seeking a fourth, she is desperate for any way out of her situation. The three teenage residents of Glass House quickly welcome Claire into their small circle; friendly Goth Eve, sarcastic and bold Shane, and mysteriously intense guitar player Michael. But they are about to become far more than housemates; by stepping into Glass House, Claire has entered into the secret world that seethes beneath the town of Morganville...a world owned by vampires. Luckily, none of her new friends are vampires...but they're also much more than they seem.Navigating a breathtakingly dangerous and suspenseful maze of danger, intrigue, and secrets, Claire has found a brave and loyal set of people to ally with. But will the four of them be enough to face the terrifying world bent on keeping them from causing any more trouble, no matter what the cost? This book was simple and fast-paced, and the main characters caught and held me immediately with their quirks, kindness, humor, loyalty, and realism.

I genuinely enjoyed Ill Wind; it was a creative, rip-roaring five-chapter venture into a new kind of urban fanatasy, and it was cool. I didn't even mind the hot tub scenes, and the ending was acceptable. I've also read one of Ms. Caine's short stories set in Morganville, in an anthology, and thought it was interesting and that I'd like to know more about the series.+1 for rendering fairly logical vampires. Can't go out in daylight, have to be invited into a house, etc; it rings true with most of the older vamp mythos I've encountered, and any deviations (AMELIE, I'm looking at you) were explained in ways that, while they do seem a little deus ex machina, I can deal with. (I should mention here that no, I'm not an expert on vampire mythology, but I have read Dracula.)+1 for the interesting housemates, though Michael was a little bit too perfect at times. Shane I saw coming a long way off, though that's probably thanks to that short story, but for a while I thought Caine was going to draw it out over a few books and just give him a protector complex in this one. Oh well. Eve was pretty cool- I think she was my favorite, just because she was abnormal but she was so much more normal in terms of how she functioned in society than Shane or Michael. And she seems to have some pretty big insecurities and worries, making her a bit motherly/responsible towards the others.+1 for being easy to read. Okay, so I know it sounds dumb, but it's a small book and it took me about half a day, all told- actually considerably less, now that I think about it. And given the minuses, this is a very good thing.-1 for Claire in general, and the first two chapters in particular. We are told from the beginning that she is OMGubersmart. We are told that she finished highschool in two years (which, by the way, means a lot of summer classes if her school is anything like mine) and that Ivy League colleges were practically begging at her feet. Her parents- including her dad, who she later thinks of in a way that convinced me he's very focused on her academics- wouldn't let her go there because she was 'too young'. And this is where I interject: \"NO SHIT SHE'S TOO YOUNG. SHE CAN STAY IN HIGHSCHOOL AND TAKE AP CLASSES AND GET COLLEGE CREDIT FOR TWO MORE YEARS AND THEN ENROLL AS A FRIGGIN' JUNIOR OR SOMETHING. And because she is OMGubersmart, she'll see this financially wise option/way to placate the 'rents, right? Umm... actually, not right. Not right at all. Instead, her parents ignore the fact that prestigious colleges will probably do whatever they ask to get their daughter there, up to and including any special supervision they might want to feel she's safe, and decide to enroll her in the idiotically named Texas Prarie University. There, instead of being, say, in some sort of small Honors-only housing complex, she's on the top floor in the worst rooms of the worst dorms.Um, yeah. Way to go, protective parents; you've put your daughter in StupidSchool and, moreover, the rattiest part of it. So, how'd that one work out?BADLY. Claire corrects one of the popular girls on the nature of WWII, who turns out to be one of those oddly common mean girls who haunt the pages of fiction, existing solely to make life a misery for the protagonist- not just to, say, ruin their social reputation or knock them down in the halls, but to ACTIVELY AND AGGRESSIVELY go after the harmless lowlife who has offended them so. In this case, this would be up to and including stealing Claire's laundry and pushing the girl down several flights of stairs. And absolutely no one will stand up to this mean girl- Monica- from the other students to the administration to the town police. Frankly, this is ridiculous. If people like this were as common as books about highschool and college make them seem, no one would make it out alive.I mentioned that the town police won't stand up to Monica. We know this because later they show up on her side- not because Claire calls them. Ms. OMGubersmart isn't nearly smart enough to call 911, it seems, or her parents. I mean, at the point that you're being pushed down a flight of stairs, it's time to suck it up and GO THE HELL HOME, no matter what. Worst they can do is make you wait a few years to go to one of the Ivies. Take online courses, get a job, or something.And by the way, if her parents were looking for a place where their little girl would be safe, why did they pick Morganville? Even from the descriptions Claire gives in passing, it sounds like a nasty place, certainly not somewhere an overprotective parent would want their sixteen year-old. I call BS. I call BS on Claire and I call it on Monica and I call it on both Danvers parents.(Also, Claire does not seem to be taking English courses. Odd, for someone who claims to be well-versed in the classics. And that's another thing- she's casually arrogant about being smart. 'Not everyone is up on the classics- except freaks like me.' 'I corrected Monica on the fact that WWII wasn't about China, but the people around her probably didn't know what it was anyway.' Ms. Caine, are we supposed to believe Claire is smart because she puts down all these other people? Are we supposed to accept that just because she thinks- thinks, and has no real reason to know- they don't know something, they actually don't? She's not even snooty, which I could live with- she's just utterly convinced of her own superiority, and it comes out in annoying little moments.)-1 for the ending. (Rant follows.) WHAT in the WORLD makes an author think they can get away with this? There was a nice denoument, and then another chapter. Thinking this would continue the nice denoument, I walked into this backhanded trap blindly. NEVER under any circumstances is there a reason to introduce a NEW PROBLEM AND/OR ENTIRE NEW PLOT AT THE END OF THE GODDAMN BOOK! This is worse than leaving the action at a critical point (Phillip Pullman and Bruce Coville are both guilty)- both are shameless ways to make sure you read the next book, but at least leaving the action doesn't feel grasping. This 'Big battle is over, all is well, OH SHIT NEW CRISIS' business hangs a sign around the author's neck. Know what it says? \"I want money, and I don't think the book itself was good enough to get you to buy the next one- in fact, maybe I know it was crap- and so I tacked this on at the end and put a critical character's life in question so you'll buy the sequel and my publisher and I will make bank.\"AAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGH.Will I read the series? @&$# NO.

It's engaging, dark and tense, kind of 'Mean Girls' meets supernatural world. Claire is a 16 year old brainiac attending college in Morganville Texas, a small town where vampires rule the roost, and there's nothing 'nice' about these vamps. When Claire gets on the wrong side of Monica, queen bitch bee of college, and her life is threatened she desperately seeks off-campus housing at the Glass House. Owned by the mysterious Michael Glass, Claire's other roomies include Eve, a rebellious goth with a caring nature and sarcastic, funny-guy Shane; a highly entertaining mix.Most of the humans in Morganville have a vampire patron meaning they're protected, but the teens of Glass House are different, they're unprotected by choice and hence ... fair game. Claire and her friends make a deal with the devil to give themselves any chance of survival in 'creepyville' and what follows is a page-turning ride. Just when you think you've got the plot all pegged, Michael's reveal is a tingly surprise. I have it on good authority from Hannah @ Changing My Definition of Life that this is a series worth continuing on with and she'd know. Hannah read the entire series in a Rachel Caine read-a-fest one week and loved them!

In fact, I'm going through my TBR pile in order so it's not my fault I had three vampire books one after another. I really liked two and third is currently being read, so we'll see. I liked this book very much. Claire wasn't annoying like I expected, though she seemed like it when I first started reading. I liked most of the characters and everything went smoothly. Though it did end on a major cliffhanger, which I really don't like. Don't kill my sweety, please. I liked world building and the whole story of vampires running the whole city. What I didn't like is how the author made some characters seem complitely irrational. Take Monica for example. She wants to kill Claire just because she made her look stupid in front of her crowd. I get that her pride was crushed, but really? To kill a girl just because of it? And not to mention she set fire to Shane's house, which unintentionally (I hope) killed his little sister? She just seemed really ridiculous sometimes and I really laughed one or two times when she said something stupid.The romance is nothing like I wanted it to be. I wanted Claire to be with Michael, for god's sake! I don't like Shane, okay?! I don't feel anything towards him and I find him rather boring. Eve is really a sweetheart and I'm happy she found her happiness, but just not with the guy I wanted her to be!!!!!!!I really want to know what happens next.

No, no, no... you don't understand... that's not a good thing. Now I'm compelled to run off and invest in the other 6 books that are waiting for me at the bookstore! Very much a predicament when you have so many unread books sitting on your bookshelf, but that's just how good this series is. It's the kind of book that clears a path on your TBR list and shoots straight to the top. I loved it! The characters were engaging and interesting, the writing was bold and refreshing, and the vampire lore was unique and... well... just perfectly paranormal. Great combo in a book from all aspects.About the book: Claire Danvers has just started her freshman year of college, and it's not going so well. She's been targeted by the dorm beeyotch and her minions who have managed to rough her up pretty bad, so she clears out and starts looking for alternative housing and pretty much a safe haven. That's when she comes across Michael, Shane and Eve who reside in the Glass House. When she meets them, Claire is exposed to a whole new world she never believe existed, which consists of vampires, protectors and evil that has plagued Morganville, TX for decades. As she forges more than just a friendship with Michael, Shane and Eve, she quickly comes to realize they must bond together to protect one another from the baddies and the dangers they are faced.What a great kick-off to what I know is an awesome series. I can't wait to jump into the next book and see where the storyline goes. Definitely a book I'd feel comfortable recommending to my fellow avid readers who are fans of paranormal and all that is vampiric and gothic.

I LOVED THIS BOOK!! Okay, wait, wait, wait. Back up. I know what I said. I said I don\u2019t like vampire-themed books. I don\u2019t want anything to do with books that have vampires in it. But, in my defense, I\u2019m a sucker for hype. Every now and again I see a review on a blog somewhere or on my Goodreads feed of one of the fifteen books in the Morganville Vampires series, and it\u2019s always a glowing, positive review. And because I\u2019m a curious person by nature, this series called to me. Yeah...no. It didn\u2019t actually call to me, it shouted at me to - at the very least - read the first book and then decide if I\u2019m anti-vampire YA. If you\u2019ve already read this book, or any book in this series for that matter, you\u2019ll know I never really stood a chance \u2013 resistance being futile and all that.I started reading Glass Houses with next to zero expectations, ready to roll my eyes at the merest mention of a handsome, broody vamp and a swooning sixteen-year old girl falling in love with aforementioned vamp. Surprisingly, about ten percent into the story, I was so fascinated with Morganville and its mysteries, and curious up to my eyeballs as to why in the name of all that is good and holy, Monica and the Monickettes (Monica\u2019s sidekicks) are tormenting geeky Claire. I\u2019m not talking taunts, mocking, a few snide comments or a couple of idle threats here and there. I\u2019m talking unadulterated cruelty that would take your breath away. Seriously, I wasn\u2019t sure Claire was going to make it past the second chapter.Then Claire moves into this old, old-world-charm house with Michael, Shane and weirdo (but very sweet) Eve, and the mystery intensifies. Before I even got to the vampire part of the story, I already had all sorts of suspicions about these three housemates allowing Claire to board with them. I think the two elements that really drew me into this book were the constant menacing undertone and the fact that every time I thought I had things figured out, another mystery popped up, needing my and Claire\u2019s investigation. I was suspicious of everyone and everything (as the author had intended) and couldn\u2019t figure out whether Oliver can be trusted or not...amongst others. I loved the characters, with Michael being my favorite, and Eve, Shane and Claire a close second. Amazingly and thankfully Claire is a strong character who can stand up for herself, even though her decisions are sometimes impulsive. She takes responsibility for the consequences of her actions, and she\u2019s obviously no airhead who constantly needs a boy\u2019s protection. I have a strong suspicion her character is going to be kicking serious butt by the end of the series. There\u2019s a tiny, tiny bit of romance in this book, and I am overjoyed that it was kept in the background. Rachel Caine has given me everything I hate in a book, but she turned it upside down into everything I love to read. I hate reading about vampires because the female lead is always falling in love with it. Not in this book. I can\u2019t stand weak, clingy, hormonal female teen leads. In Glass Houses, the female lead is everything I want her to be, flaws and all. I love action in books, but am not too big on too much romance, and this book had exceptional action scenes in the final chapters that trumped the little bit of romance there was ten love. And, wow...then there\u2019s the mother of all cliffhanger endings... Overall, Glass Houses ended up having all my favorite story elements in it, and overnight turned me into a Rachel Caine super-fan. Although I wouldn\u2019t consider this a horror exactly, I would recommend it to fans of this genre as Caine expertly keeps the sinister feel of Morganville going throughout the story to keep the suspense at high voltage. I\u2019d also recommend this series to readers who are tired of reading vampire romance, because these vampires are the stuff nightmares are made of. Nothing romantic or cuddly about them. If you\u2019ve already read this book and loved it, also check out Tim O\u2019 Rourke\u2019s Kiera Hudson vampire series.

How did I not pick this series up sooner?I fell in love with this series after the very first page, and I'm not entirely sure why. Could it be the young adult story, told with a writing style that is similar to those found in adult novels? Could it be the adorable easy-to-love easy-to-hate characters? Could it be the fast paced plot packed with real, dangerous vampires? The answer is yes, it could be all of the above.Let's begin with the characters. I adore the main character Claire. I found her so easy to relate to and I thought she was pretty much everything a main character should be. Eve, Shane and Michael are three other main characters who I would honestly die for at this point. We all need a best friend like Eve and guys like Shane and Michael in our lives. I don't want to say much more about them, because discovering these four people were one of the things that made this book amazing.Now, we'll move onto the plot. It's been quite some time since I've read a real vampire book. And I mean real in two different ways. 1. Vampires are not trying to sneak in your room and cuddle you in your sleep, they're trying to suck your blood. And 2. The way the plot moved was very realistic and if I found out vampires existed, this would present a scenario that would make it easily believable. I loved that when you got a sense of a vampire, your first sense was fear in this book. Young adult novels seemed to have forgotten that vampires were once blood-sucking demons, even if they are schmexy. And the plot moved at a realistic pace and there wasn't anything I read and thought, only in a book/movie.I could rant and rave about how much I loved this book all day, but I will spare you. There is one last thing I wanted to talk about though. If you have ever read an adult book (now, I'm not speaking strictly cheesy erotic romance here) than you know that there is something about them that makes them different from YA. Its not the age or the maturity of the characters/plot, but something in the writing style that makes adult books hard to not like. Well, Rachel Caine brings that magical element, and mixes it with everything we love about YA, plus more. You're crazy if you don't pick this book up.FIRST LINE: \"On the day Claire became a member of Glass House, somebody stole her laundry.\"-Page OneRATING BREAKDOWN: Plot: 20/20Characters: 20/20Creativity: 18/20Writing: 20/20Cover: 9/10Ending: 10/10=97/100, A"}, {"userName": "Anita", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/940248-anita", "userReview": "This book convinced me that I'm not a fan of Rachel Caine's style of storytelling. She's very hard on her protagonists (killing them, mentally and physically abusing them, etc), and she loves cliff-hanger endings. Both are negatives for me. The timeline irritates me as well - maybe a week? It reminded me of House of Night, which I hate. I was equally irritated by the one and a half books I've read of Weather Wardens, so I think I should give up on this author. Too bad - the premise of the Morganville Vampires series has a lot of promise.Basics of the plot: College town Morganville is run by vampires. All the protected citizens donate blood regularly and 2% of the unprotected college kids are \"culled\" every year. Claire is a 16 year old genius who is at this no-name college for the next two years because it's close enough to home to suit her parents. She's tormented/abused/hazed by idiot evil bitch Monica in her dorm, and Monica and her cronies almost kill Claire. Claire moves off campus to the Glass House and makes friends with Shane, Eve, and Michael, who clue her in to the dark side of Morganville. Several more attempts are made on Claire's life, and eventually she gets her hands on a book the vampires value, so they mob the Glass House, sending in humans to do their dirty work (because vampires can't cross the threshold univited). The most irritating part of the Claire character for me was her unwillingness to leave town after several attempts on her life - for a genius, she's quite a moron."}], "description": "From the author of the popular Weather Warden series comes the debut of an exciting new series set in Morganville, Texas, where you would be well advised to avoid being out after dark.College freshman Claire Danvers has had enough of her nightmarish dorm situation.
