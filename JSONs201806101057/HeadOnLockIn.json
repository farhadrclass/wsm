For instance, we have zero idea if the Main Character Chris is a boy or a girl, even the audiobooks have two different narrator options one male and one female. \u00a0Since everyone interacts with Chris either in virtual space or a robot system you really don\u2019t get normal gender clues. I really like that Chris is essentially genderless by today\u2019s standards.Chris and his/her partner Vann are FBI agents normally tasked with crimes involving Hadens (members of society who are locked in their bodies and interact with the world virtually or with a robot they pilot). \u00a0\u00a0When there is death of a Haden player at a Hilketa match, Chris and Vann are the natural team to call in for the investigation. How does the beheading of a piloted robot lead to the death of the pilot who is states away?\n\n\u201cThat threep\u2019s the goat. That\u2019s the player the other team wants to rip the head off of. They try to take his head, while his team tries to keep him from having his head ripped off.\u201d\u201cAnd when the head is taken, they try to punt it through the goalposts.\u201d\u201cPunt it, toss it, or carry it through, yes.\u201d\u201cAnd everyone has swords and hammers and bats\u2014\u201d\u201cThey have those because that shit\u2019s just fun.\u201d\n\nThe mystery plot for Head On worked for me a lot better and seemed more planned and polished. \u00a0Chris and Vann have a fun banter between them that makes the dialogue fun and easy to read. I also like that both Chris and Vann are not flat characters but have a good dimensionality to them making them more human. \u00a0\u00a0But the real winner for me, at least in this series, is the world. I really get caught up in what it would be like to live in a world that has C-3POesk robot walking down the street being piloted by a person who can\u2019t move and could be anywhere.\n\n\"I did not destroy another threep,\u201d I said. \u201cA car did.\u201d\"You got hit by a car.\u201d\u201cTwice.\u201d\u201cSo, once for the experience and twice to be sure?\u201d Tony asked. \u201cHey, weren\u2019t you hit by a car when you were a kid?\u201d\u201cIt was a truck.\u201d\u201cSame concept. Three times is a fetish, Chris,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWhich is your business. But it gets pretty pricey. You might want to take up a less expensive hobby, like cocaine.\u201d\n\nSo if you are a fan of cool, fleshed out SciFi worlds and also like murder mysteries then the Lock In series could really be something to put on your TBR list. \u00a0Wil Wheaton is the male narrator and I thought he did a fantastic job on Lock In if you are a fan of audio.I received this book for free from NetGalley for an honest review.

But here's the funny part: the sports aspect is unique as hell and full of some great twists. :) Such as getting your head pulled off during the play to be used as a football. As part of the game. :)Those people from the previous book, the folks who're stuck in their bodies and can only get out by using a waldo-robot or by those biological peeps who are wired for it are now pretty much the only game in town when it comes to full contact sports. It's all robots, of course, and transferred consciousnesses, and a wild story that's the equal of any modern mystery in that OTHER genre. :)In a lot of ways, I think this sequel featuring our favorite FBI Lock-In is superior to the first. :)I'm totally glad to have read it.

By blogger/novelist I don\u2019t mean \u201cnovelist who blogs\u201d, or blogger who turns their blog into a book, but of a specific mutant hybrid of both mediums. Scalzi has transposed all the elements of a thriving blog into his fiction writing career: a prolific output that needs to be both urgent and memorable, that feels like a product of the present-day culture\u2019s collective consciousness as much as a piece of his own brain spilling out onto page and screen. A unique biochemical cocktail is required for a brain like this to squirm its way into the marketplace of ideas, a kind of ego-driven charisma that relies far more on generosity than selfishness, but also acknowledges that a healthy dallop of self-centeredness is an essential part of the formula. There\u2019s a moment in his new novel, the near-future crime thriller Head On, when FBI agent Chris Shane takes a \u201cclassic\u201d Catherynne Valente novel from a suspect\u2019s bookshelf during an interrogation, and both interviewer and interviewee awkwardly profess their love for it before moving on to the business at hand. Shout-outs to friends and colleagues are a staple of Scalzi the blogger and Scalzi the novelist, a show of warm-hearted regard that accedes not only to an author\u2019s place in the production of a text, but to this author\u2019s in particular. It\u2019s not just a shout-out to Valente as a fellow traveler, but to Scalzi\u2019s own devoted fan base, who know that moments like these express why he loves doing what he does.Head On is the standalone sequel to Lock In, Scalzi\u2019s popular and well-regarded technothriller from 2014. Lock In set up a near-future scenario where a small but significant percentage of the population is afflicted with Haden\u2019s syndrome, which leaves its victims with fully active brains literally locked inside their completely inert bodies. Public accommodations for this new class of persons with disabilities ensue, resulting in, alongside other technological advances, robotic vehicles called \u201cthreeps\u201d that a Haden can operate remotely using a neural net attached to their brains. Threeps allow Hadens to live relatively normal professional and social lives while their bodies remain stationary. Lock In introduced us to Haden FBI agent Chris Shane and his partner, non-Haden Leslie Vann, as they investigated a murder committed using Haden-based technology. In Head On, Scalzi explores the way Hadens culture leaves its mark on mass entertainment \u2013 in this case a professional sports league called Hilketa, where Hadens pilot their threeps in a game where scoring depends on forcibly removing the (robot) head of an opposing player. At the opening of Head On, a player\u2019s real body dies as its threep\u2019s head is removed, and suspicious activity by the league\u2019s front office points to a coverup. Shane and Vann once again become enmeshed in a high-profile case with huge stakes, big money interests, and intense media scrutiny.I\u2019ve always felt that Scalzi writes fiction with a journalist\u2019s flair for delivering information in accessible, controlled bursts. The overture to Head On comes in the form of a magazine (or probably webzine) article, a very convincing bit of faux sports reporting for Scalzi\u2019s imaginary Hilketa league that effortlessly manages to pulls off the holy grail of genre writing: the invisible info-dump \u2013 a way of setting the table for the estranged reader in a way that would feel organic to a familiar one. It\u2019s an effective tone-setter that plays on Scalzi\u2019s strengths as a writer \u2013 his ability to write science fiction that appeals to SF fans without alienating non-SF readers. Scalzi can sometimes be overly meticulous in designing his plots, so part of the fun of Head On comes when you realize that his protagonist shares his creator\u2019s passion for methodical professionalism, but his enemy is more likely akin to a belligerent fool who let one bad idea spiral dangerously out of control. A snapshot of the present moment in America, if there ever was one.In many ways, Head On and its predecessor feel closer to the Scalzi of internet lore than his space operas do. POV narrator Shane disseminates his tale in the same easygoing, smart and snarky manner that Scalzi the blogger is known for, and while one could say the same of his other protagonists, only Shane gets to do so in a milieu that roughly approximates present day America. Because as much as Scalzi likes to make up cool stuff about things that might happen someday, he also likes to say witty things about stuff that\u2019s going on right now, and in Head On he gets to do both in the kind of quick, digestible bites that fire up the neurons without weighing the reader down. In other words, Head On is about issues that matter to readers\u2019 lives today, told with characters who pilot anthropomorphic robot suits. Add to this the fact that he is doing so in the form of the invincibly popular crime thriller and that the deciding agent of the story is a cat named Donut, and you know you are dealing with an author who sucks up to his readers in all the right ways.As much as I find Scalzi\u2019s writing consistently entertaining, I\u2019m actually surprised at how much I liked Head On. Lock In has the distinction of being my least favorite of Scalzi\u2019s novels; I can say with confidence, however, that Head On won me over without diverging much from the formula its predecessor established. Fans and skeptics alike should be satisfied by the time they reach the final page.Many thanks to Netgalley and the folks at Tor Books for the opportunity to read this ARC."}, {"userName": "Jilly", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894509-jilly", "userReview": "*Shakes Fist at John Scalzi!!!*Damn you, Scalzi!

Chris is a girl. I've declared it because:1. I want Chris to be a girl because she's so freaking cool and snarky.2.

Seems like something girls would love.3. In the first book, when her partner saw Chris's actual body, she said that she was surprised. I think she had been assuming Chris was a male.4. Did I mention that Chris is too cool to be a boy? She's one of us.So, problem solved. You might as well write it in now, Scalzi. No, I'm serious. Get on this. You're riding my last nerve here.Chris's partner, Leslie, is also very cool. In good cop-bad cop, she's always bad cop. She just does it so well.The crime they are trying to solve has to do with a death during a game that is basically robot wars. Robots trying to rip off each other's heads to use as a ball. Strangely, this doesn't even seem silly or crazy anymore. We all know that if we get robot bodies - this will become a sport. Really, how many years away can this be? Scalzi is a genius!hey wait...it's been done. Screw you, Scalzi!!There is tons of humor and fun while they try and solve the crime. Plus, as an added bonus, more people and robots die.

Once again the daring duo of Chris (of the indeterminate gender) and Van find themselves involved in a complex investigation that intersects with the Haden community. In this case Hilketa, a sport that combines football with gladiatorial combat and robot bodies. Of course all is not as it appears, billions of dollars in investments are at risk, and death is always just around the corner.As far as the mystery goes Scalzi once again delivers a twisty-turny case that meshes very well with the wider plot and makes good use of the world he has conjured up. I don't want to get too deep into it, sufficed to say I had no idea what the conspiracy was until the very end and I was engaged in the story the whole time. All the characters are great and jive well together. I continue to love the Van-Chris partnership. I am happy to see there is not a whiff of sexual tension there, they are both dedicated investigators who work well together and respect each other. For my money they are the best investigative duo in the SFF space.But what I would rather talk about is how Scalzi uses the fictional medical condition in this series to explore broader social ideas. I have always maintained that good science fiction is a reflection on contemporary society, either how it is or how it could be. In the case of this series Scalzi examines just what it means to be an outsider of society. People suffering from Haden's Syndrome are physically separated from the rest of humanity, forced to interact through an online space or through robots (threeps). They are very much separate from the rest of humanity and rightly view themselves as a distinct minority group, even if their numbers span the spectrum of humanity.That is what makes Hilketa so interesting. It is a respected space where Haden's actually have an advantage over the rest of humanity. Because they have spend so much of their lives interacting through Threeps they are much, much better suited to navigating them in a competitive environment even if, in theory, the league is open to everyone. It is a mark of pride for the community so when one of the players dies on the field it is a big deal.On top of that the previous book saw the repeal of many support programs and funding for Hadens. We see early impact of this repeal in Head On. Hadens will find it more difficult to afford threeps and be forced more and more to the fringes of society. Even with Hilketa and prominent Hadens like Chris they rightly fear they will become another marginalized group. Compounded with the seemingly inevitable trend that would allow normal humans to also operate threeps and the Haden community in this book feels very much under siege. And I found that interesting. Scalzi didn't just make the disease and its effects as a convenient means of forcing Chris to drive a threep and thereby distinguishing him/her from other similar characters. Scalzi extrapolated just how such a community would behave and how society to adjust to their existence. That exploration feeds into the stories and gives the world a very deep feel. Slap on some of that trademarked Scalzi snark and you get a really fun, engaging, and surprisingly insightful sci-fi mystery.If you wanted to know about Hilketa (the fictional game from this book) here you go, courtesy of Tor."}, {"userName": "Robin (Bridge Four)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14105531-robin-bridge-four", "userReview": "A Solid 4 Star ReadIn a world where 1% of the population interacts with the rest of the world in something akin to C-3PO this was a game that was bound to be invented.\n\nThe reason Hilketa is so popular is that the players score points through simulated decapitation, and go after each other with melee weapons.

It was therefore with great excitement that I picked up Head On, which is described as its standalone sequel. And indeed, you may choose to read this without having read the first book, but personally I feel you will be missing out on the subtler nuances of the series if you skipped right to this one. The world of Lock In and Head On is a very complex place and, as I will explain later in my review, reading both books will give you a fuller view of the picture.Once more, readers follow Chris Shane, the series\u2019 rookie FBI agent protagonist. Chris is also a Haden, the name given to those individuals whose minds are \u201clocked in\u201d as the result of a devastating flu that swept across the globe several decades ago. This disease killed many in the first stage of the infection, but a percentage went on to survive only to suffer acute meningitis, which affected the victim\u2019s brain and caused them to become trapped in a state of being fully awake and aware but having no control over their voluntary nervous systems. A cure for this condition (dubbed Haden\u2019s Syndrome after the then president\u2019s wife who was the most famous person to be affected at the time) was given the highest priority, though none was ever found. Instead, scientists created humanoid personal transports called \u201cThreeps\u201d into which locked in individuals were able to link their minds remotely, allowing them to interact with their world even as their physical bodies remained immobile.By the time this series takes place, personal transport technology has become much more developed and advanced. It has even permeated into the world of professional sports, in which Hadens pilot specialized Threeps in a fast and furious game known as Hilketa. Though the sport itself is extremely violent, involving the lopping off of heads with swords and war hammers, no one technically gets hurt because the only \u201cbodies\u201d getting battered and broken on the field are the robot-like Threeps. However, during a high-profile special exhibition game, an up-and-coming player named Duane Chapman suddenly dies in the middle of a match meant to attract new investors to the North American Hilketa League, his vitals disappearing off the boards for all to see. NAHL officials are quick to cover up the incident, leading Chris, who was present in the skybox during the fatal match, to suspect there\u2019s more to Chapman\u2019s death than meets the eye.Like its predecessor, Head On reads like a sci-fi mystery thriller, following FBI agents Chris Shane and Leslie Vann as they sniff out clues and hunt down the perpetrators in Haden-related crimes. But unlike the previous installment, it dispenses with much of the social commentary and focus on topical themes, putting the emphasis on investigative procedures the actual crime solving. Happily, the culprit also wasn\u2019t as obvious this time compared to Lock In. As a result, I felt that this sequel was more exciting in terms of pacing and levels of suspense, especially since the trail to find Duane Chapman\u2019s murderer subsequently leads Chris to all kinds of strange personalities and bizarre happenings related to the dark underbelly of the Hilketa industry. Uncovering everything from backroom deals to sordid affairs, our protagonist winds up being caught up in series of harrowing events that include arson, assassination, and a whole pile of destroyed Threeps. Needless to say, this novel ended up being a very quick read, since all that intensity and action made it hard to put down.That said, the book also lost much of its cerebral and philosophical bite due to the diminished exploration into social themes like disability, ethics in medicine, and other discussion-worthy subjects related to a world in which a significant percentage of the population suffer from an expensive and life-altering condition. While Head On lightly touches upon some of these issues, such as government funding for individuals with Haden Syndrome or the social perceptions of them in public, in this particular arena, Lock In still holds the edge. This isn\u2019t really a dig at Head On, however; after all, you can only expound upon these themes beyond the first book to a certain extent before it starts becoming repetitive. As such, this is why I think it would be a good idea to read the two books in order; you\u2019ll get the insightful commentary in the first one and the action and suspense in the second\u2014the best of both worlds.Head On, though, is still in every sense a Scalzi novel. It has his signature style all over it: in the clever premise, the slick sense of humor, the quippy lines of dialogue. It\u2019s also interesting to note, while the author is careful not to reveal the gender of the series protagonist, in my mind I still picture Chris Shane as male because Scalzi can\u2019t ever seem to write a convincing enough female POV (see examples Zoe\u2019s Tale or The Sagan Diary). However, that\u2019s just my personal opinion and ultimately a non-issue, since it didn\u2019t distract or take away from my overall enjoyment of this particular novel, whose pages I devoured while loving every moment of the story.In the end, I think I enjoyed this book just as much as Lock In, even though its tone may have shifted slightly more to a traditional mystery thriller narrative\u2014which can be a good thing, depending on the type of reader you are. For me, Scalzi\u2019s stories are always a delight because of how clever, witty, and approachable they are, and this one was no exception. I had a smashing good time with Head On, and whether you are new to the author or a long-time fan, I think you will too."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley", "userReview": "Scalzi's books are always such good palette cleansers. Head On was fast and fun (and a little bit infuriating).This is the second book in the Lock In series, which started with 2014's Lock In. You don't need to have read the first book if this one tickles your fancy, but you should, because it's great. The premise here is that in the near future, a disease called Haden's Syndrome (after the first lady of the US, it's most famous victim) makes it so that a portion of the population are locked in to their bodies, perfectly aware, but unable to move on their own or care for themselves. But because of the first lady, massive amounts of funding and research happened early on, and led to social progormas, legislation, and inventions to benefit the new population. The most significant of these are the Agora, a virtual space where Hadens (as they've come to be called) can be ambulatory and interact with one another, and Threeps (short for Threepio), robot bodies that Hadens can use to move about in the physical world.Half the fun in these books is watching the way Scalzi plays with the social and economic order in a world where something like this has happened. Of course, I say fun, but it's not ALL fun. These are also murder mystery/thrillers, after all, and our protagonist is a Haden named Chris who was famous in childhood for being a Haden and having a famous NBA player father, but who is now an FBI agent. The dynamic between Chris in a Threep body and Chris's partner, Leslie, is continually fascinating. Not least because Leslie is a really fun character, very bitter and full of piss and vinegar. Scalzi has thought out the worldbuilding here very well.But in this one specifically, the mystery is also a delightful combo of dark humor and surprising pathos. Hilketa is the fastest growing sport in the world, and it can only be played by people in a Threep, because the entire point of the game is to rip your opponent's head off and use it to score points. Not something a person in a non-robot body would be able to handle, but very amusing to think about, and just as in the world in the book, entertaining to watch. However, also just as in the book, we as the reader are immediately made to feel guilty for our barbaric impulses, as the case of a murdered Hilketa player who died in the middle of gameplay after having his Threep's head ripped off three times in one game, brings to light the dark underbelly of the sport, and the corporate greed that is steadily making things worse for all Hadens.I expected for this book to make me laugh, because Scalzi's stuff always does that for me, but I didn't expect it to make me angry.I hope Scalzi keeps putting these books out every once in a while. Not least because I want him to write a book that deals with the worsening conditions for Hadens legally, and in a substantial way instead of a background one. Chris, as an extremely privileged person, has not really been affected by it all because all that NBA money means multiple Threeps can be bought, not one but two personal carers can be hired, and Chris never has to worry about healthcare or job security, so I think that might be an interesting POV to write from."}, {"userName": "Vivian", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3947172-vivian", "userReview": "\"Basically, Hilketa is both representation and alienation for Hadens.\"This is an FBI procedural story set in the near future where the case is focused on robot controlled medieval gladiatorial sports, Hilketa. I wish there had been more sport, but this emphasized the political and economical consequences of Hadens, especially how business and legislation are in a constant push and pull. It feels like a Washington D.C. story with the lens decidedly on the business side. The trajectory was good, but it felt dry. This is not a thriller even though there are elements which certainly seem pegged as such. But I guess that the protagonist, Agent Chris Shane, because he is a Haden can be preternaturally calm since his physical body is not responsible for the checks his threep is cashing. This had some interesting points about inclusion for people who are limited by their physical bodies in the social world through threeps--imagine androids you can neurally connect to and interact in everyday life from work to shopping to family. Imagine them as star athletes with huge endorsement deals. It also brings to question all the other kinds of human interaction including sex and identity. Overall, this was a fun read.

This did not affect my rating or review.Not a lot to say here besides I freaking loved this book. I loved Lock In (the first book in the series) and the world that John Scalzi created. I adored the characters of Vann and Chris. Though the book is told via Chris's POV, I do wish one of the books would be told in Vann's POV. She is just my favorite.It's been several months or at least a year since the events in the first book. We have Chris still working for the FBI and partnering with Vann. When Chris goes to meet his parents at a Hilketa game, he witnesses a player being taken off the field. Everyone quickly realizes the player is dead. The FBI is brought in due to the fact that the Hilketa game is played by Hadens and that means though the crime took place in Washington, D.C. the Haden player's body was somewhere else. What follows is a lot of twists and turns until you have Chris and Vann figure out how somehow could have killed someone while they were playing a game. Chris is still living with his roommates and though they were barely in the first half of the book, they do pop up in the second half more. His partnership with Vann is still the best. They crack me up and pop off each other a lot. Chris's parents are still reassuringly there for their son and are involved with the plot in this book too. We do get new characters in this one and we get to meet another integrator (someone who had the first symptoms of Haden's, but didn't get the full disease) whose life I wish we were told more about. I swear that Scalzi could totally publish some novellas featuring new characters and I would not be upset. I do love the world that Scalzi has built in this one. Hadens are unfortunately dealing with the fall-out from a bill that was passed in the last book. Many are struggling to make ends meet and now there are rumblings about having non-Hadens get their own threeps as well. I like that Chris sees the issues with this in this book, and I wonder if this is going to pop up in the next book as a plot point. The ending leaves things with some of the bad guys caught, but with Chris and Vann realizing a bigger conspiracy may be out there. I really did need the X-Files theme song blaring away in the background at this point."}, {"userName": "kartik narayanan", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan", "userReview": "Head On is a good follow up to Lock In. Most of the complaints I had about Lock In have been addressed here, while it still retains all of its strengths.In my review of Lock In, I mentioned that its strength was its excellent world building - on par with any Asimov out there - while it was let down by its poor storyline and paper thin characters. Rejoice! I liked the story in Head On and the characters, while not robust, are definitely better portrayed this time. John Scalzi choses to focus on the aftermath of the AK act with its implications on the industries that were relying on the pork coming with the Haden disability act. There is a game here, which while I personally found boring, at least adds to the richness of the story. In fact, the story revolves around this game and its associated league. There is a nice little conspiracy underlying all this.I am looking forward to the next one!"}, {"userName": "Maryam", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53037-maryam", "userReview": "I always enjoy Scalzi\u2019s books. Always fun and fast passed Sci-Fi.

Although violent no player should be in real danger but everything changes when a player dies during a game and one of the audience is Chris , the most famous Haden which happens to be a FBI agent who will be in charge for this case along with his not too friendly partner.I liked this book more than previous one."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "I\u2019m so glad that Scalzi returns to the fascinating near-future world of Hadens, people representing about 1% of the world\u2019s population who were stricken with an epidemic causing neural damage in a pattern leaving them totally unable to move. This state, called \u201cLocked-In\u201dand used for the earlier novel\u2019s title, was the target of a massive, \u201cmoonshot\u201d of government sponsored research efforts and subsidies which led to the development two avenues for the disease victims to live effective lives. One was sophisticated neural implants allowing their immobile selves mental control and emulated sensory input from android robots, as connected via a super, universal-sort of WiFi. The second was a special online virtual world where many Hadens prefer to spend the majority of their time in the company of their peers. Our hero Chris is a famous Haden, the son of a wealthy couple who helped lead the policy initiatives behind the life-giving technology innovations. He humbly and effectively serves as an FBI agent dealing with Haden-related crimes, partnered with a tough veteran female agent, Vann, who complements Chris\u2019 insight-based ethical approach with a sarcastic, no-nonsense style. The case that kicks off the story here concerns a Haden, Chapman, who dies while remote-piloting his specialized combat android in a professional stadium game called Hilketa. This lucrative team sport sounds like a no-holds barred kind of rugby in which points are scored for taking off the head of an opponent and moving it to the goal. The physiological monitoring system suggests an epileptic-like disturbance preceded his death. The league\u2019s owners are concerned that the investigation will conclude that the sport is dangerously stressful to the participating Hadens experiencing the sensations though the virtual sensorium. If instead someone has put an additive into the Haden\u2019s IV supplement, it would suggest someone may be trying to sabotage their gravy train, right when companies involved are trying to expand the league to Asia and Europe for a big new surge in profits. When one of the company executives turns up dead from an apparent but suspicious suicide, corporate corruption and greed seems to be at play somehow.A third alternative is that the player who died was killed somehow for personal reasons. His estranged wife of the dead player, a regular human, in fact clues Chris into the affair her husband has been having with another Haden. How is that possible with Hadens? Via sexbots! Now Scalzi is giving us an innovation of plausibly large economic interest. It is a fair projection that lots of normal humans might be willing to get the same neural implants as the Hadens if they could act out and feel things via their choice of anatomically correct (or fancifully equipped) android avatars for outrageous sex. He doesn\u2019t have to immerse us much into the details to convey some interesting possibilities. They outshadow the potential of normal humans with implants for pursuing play in the Hilketa league.All these novel motivations for murder and its coverup are like new wine in the old bottles of a traditional police procedural. Ditto for the police-buddy teamwork of Chris and Vann, replete with snappy jokes, one upmanship, and good cop/bad cop routines in interviews. At the same time, a regular human detective partnered with an apparent robot harks back to the flavor of Asimov\u2019s \u201cI Robot\u201d series. The ability of Chris, lying in a bed in his parent\u2019s house, to essentially leap across distances to \u201cappear\u201d in the control and form of different android machines in various locations leads to a lot of exciting surprises in the action. Like a cop whose bravado gets him in trouble for wrecking too many vehicles, Chris has a patterns of frequently getting expensive departmental models wrecked, burned up, or run over by vehicles. And Haden criminals hiding out their selves in expensive simulations in the Agora virtual world can be tracked down there by Chris. I\u2019ve always loved sci fi exploration of personalized places in computer networks, starting with Gibson and Stephenson\u2019s work that predates the internet.

Scalzi is masterful with world-building and has created a fascinating dystopian world that feels realistic\u00a0and believable. The reader quickly comprehends the Hayden virus and new technological\u00a0advancements make the leap to this world seem grounded. \n   If you love procedural crime novels, you will love tagging along with FBI Agents Chris Shane and his partner,\u00a0Leslie Vann. The two are investigating the death of a Hilketa\u00a0player who dies during the game. Clues lead them to scandal and corporate\u00a0greed all while providing near-death experiences, witness tampering and Shane losing one-two-many\u00a0Threeps (machines that Hadens'\u00a0move around with). \n   You appreciate\u00a0witty humor, brilliant detective work, and strong characters. I like Agent Shane; he is direct and to the point. Scalzi lets the reader be a part of Chris's thought process as he works the case but also gives us moments with his family, friends and the daily trials of living with Haden. Secondary characters from suspects to associates added depth and further fleshed out the plot. \n   The case was riveting with plenty of twists, turns, and false leads. During the investigation,\u00a0it showcased how the corporate\u00a0world uses laws not specifically intended for them to pad their bottom line. It was a relevant topic and added believability to the case. \n   Wil Wheaton narrated, and he is perfect\u00a0for this series and characters. His wide range of voices both male and female, pacing and tone enhanced\u00a0an already\u00a0brilliant story.\u00a0 His narration took the story to the next level.

Audiobook: Wil Wheaton is always a good fit for John Scalzi, and here is no different. I do mean to try to the Amber Benson version of the books at some point, but for me Wil Wheaton will always be my first choice for a Scalzi book.\nFull Review\nAt this point I've read nearly all of John Scalzi's books and enjoyed most of them. Lock In was no different. The idea of a disease leading to a new minority of people who trapped inside their own bodies makes for an interesting premise and some pretty creative world building.I wish more time was spent in the virtual world inhabited by many of the Haydn's, but since this is primarily a detective/murder story it's a bit hard to do so. Mr. Scalzi does ramp things up in the physical world with some pretty interesting new designs for Threeps (the electronic bodies that Haydn's can use to interact with the physical world).The premise of this one is built around a few Threeps that can have their heads taken off in a sort of blood sport (minus the actual blood). As a fan of both traditional sports and some esports, this feels like a little of both. I'm not sure I'd be interested enough to actually watch it myself however.It definitely added to the world building of the first book, and seems like the kind of thing that would emerge from the world that Mr. Scalzi created.The book is again told from the point of view an ambiguous protagonist. We still don't know whether Chris is male or female, and it doesn't matter (which I think is the main point). Chris is mostly competent at his job as they serves as junior investigator to his more seasoned partner who doesn't take shit from anyone.We get to meet some more of Chris's roommates in this book (at least I don't really remember any of them apart from Tony from the first one) but there isn't a ton of depth to most of the characters beyond the protagonist, his partner and maybe his parents. There really isn't a lot of time for much character development.This is the second book in a series, but I think Mr. Scalzi did a good job in making it read like a stand alone. I feel like you start here and not be too confused, then circle back to read the first book and/or the novella.This one was pretty short and I tore through it quickly but very much enjoyed it. I hope he writes a third one at some point, although I'd probably prefer it doesn't happen until he finishes his space opera series (The Interdependency) first."}, {"userName": "Taschima", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2435020-taschima", "userReview": "All I gotta say is FINALLY! <3"}], "description": "John Scalzi returns with Head On, the standalone follow-up to the New York Times bestselling and critically acclaimed Lock In.
