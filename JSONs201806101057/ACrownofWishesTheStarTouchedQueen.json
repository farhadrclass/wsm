Every single word of this book is exquisite--and the lush, intricate world-building is nothing short of remarkable. (I pretty much alternated sighing over the glorious prose with sighing over Vikram.) Gauri is one hell of a nuanced, badass heroine, and the vivid world she inhabits is full of wondrous magic, deadly intrigues, and creatures from your loveliest dreams and darkest nightmares. As much as I adored THE STAR-TOUCHED QUEEN, I think I might love A CROWN OF WISHES even more. Everything Roshani writes is a feast for the senses, and I can't wait to read whatever she publishes next!"}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "Roshani Chokshi is on the right path to becoming one of my favourite authors of all time. If she keeps writing the way she does, that is.Because she writes like a goddess. As long as her stories are as magical as her writing, her books will always be winners (a.k.a. New York Times bestsellers).Although this is marketed as a ''companion novel'' to The Star-Touched Queen, one can argue quite convincingly that this is more of an ''unconventional'' sequel.I\u2019d go for ''sequel'' myself, because this seems to complete the first book in a subtle but noticeable way. Since it\u2019s very different from its predecessor, I do dare urge you to read it, even if you weren\u2019t fan of Maya\u2019s story, because this is nothing like the latter.In fact, it reminded me of Caraval. In both books there is a competition taking place with a wish as prize. Furthermore, the main characters are partnered with someone who they consider their enemy of a sort. And both novels are so pleasurable to read.I will admit that I found everything to be too easy for Gauri and Vikram. The characters are put in danger numerous times, yet I never truly feared for them, because I knew nothing bad could really happen to them. In other words, those scenes were rather short and not exactly convincing. But I was still surprised by some outcomes. The characters are far more three-dimensional and original than the ones from The Star-Touched Queen. I liked the secondary ones even as much as the main ones. I\u2019d definitely love to read Aasha\u2019s story, should Roshani Chokshi write it. The mythology is fantastic. I sure hope she\u2019ll expand this world-building more. In the first book, it doesn\u2019t look like much, but we know so much more about it thanks to this sequel. I\u2019ve come to admire it, so I want more, more, more of it. Greedy me.The romance is extremely convincing. Oh, I just cannot resist well-done love/hate relationships.Two chapters in and you\u2019re in love.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019"}, {"userName": "softlykaz (on hiatus)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42130592-softlykaz-on-hiatus", "userReview": "lean in close to my chest\u2026. listen\u2026.. if you\u2019re quiet enough you can hear a soft chorus of \u2018read this book\u2026read this book\u2019 in place of my heartbeat.this book was so gorgeous I honestly want to lie in spring grass for a couple weeks and you can find me glowing and covered in roses!! like have you ever enjoyed reading a book so much that you couldn't stand it? It fills up your insides, all the way to the brim, and you feel like you could overflow? you like it so much you don\u2019t know what to do with it? I wish I could somehow show all of you the beauty contained in this book...instead I'll just be here, tuttering out fifteen sentence fragments that no-one can make sense of, not even me.\n\u201cThe key to immortality is in creating a story that will outlive you.\u201d\n\n\nso. what's this book about?\n\nA Fox prince who's been living on the crumbs of power and who was starving for more and an Exiled Princess who wrote herself as the knight in all the stories walk into a pane beyond theirs that trades only on dreams knitted into tales and carried by birds, to take part in the Tournament of Wishes and win one wish and one wish only.But first they need to survive in a realm of dazzling terrifying otherworldly creatures: kidnapped queens crowned in golden-jeweled halos and not-so-poisonous serpent kings, lethal courtisans hiding their hunger for men's desire behind ethereal emeralds and stunning sapphires, glorious monkeys looking for their lost queen and three Nameless who are greedy to be more deadly and more beautiful and more potent.\n\u201c\u2026 they say the Lord of Treasures hosts a tournament for the very best and the very worst, the dreamers and the broken. He\u2019ll play a game with you unlike any tournament you have ever played. You might have to find your true name in a castle of stars, or wrestle your voice from a demon, or sip poison and eat fear \u2026\u201d\nReading this book made me feel like I was in a time space continuum. It's the kind of book that will throw you into a panicked state because you would be feeling like you were somehow not making the most of it and you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re supposed to do but the story will end soon and you\u2019re running out of time!!And gosh, the writing was so beautiful. It sat in halos of dandelions around the heads of the readers it wove dreams for, wearing long flowing maxi dresses with flower crowns. And honestly?? I\u2019m just so honored to have lived on the Earth at the same time as Roshani Chokshi.\n\nTHE CHARACTERS:\n\n\u2728 VIKRAM/The Fox Prince\n\u201cHave some faith.\u201d \u201cBetween faith and distrust, which one is more likely to keep you alive?\u201d \u201cAnd which one is more likely to let you experience living?\u201d \nMy last words are probably going to be a list of all the 'sarcastic witty characters who hide their tragic backstories behind a sharp jaw and a perfect smirk' that I've adopted throughout the yearsVikram is the Prince of Ujijain and the adopted son of its king. He's been robbed out of endless opportunities to grow and his potential has been stamped on time and time again because the Council believed the unshared royal blood had too much bearing on his worth. So will he use his one wish to make his kingdom something that was really his?I know I just made Vikram sound too serious just then but know that he's literally the kind of dude who would send you weird pictures at 2 am with the caption \u201cthat\u2019s u\u201d and who probably has a storage of cheesy memes about love that they send to their significant other and I actually love him so much it's just like ????!!!???!?!?!?!?! ??? how the hell did this happen? He's also relatable in the sense that I too like to cover up my real feelings with aggressive sarcasm and unrelatable in the same way that people who actually live their lives to their fullest potential tend to be, ya know.\u2728 GAURI/The jewel of Bharata\n\u201cYou\u2019re a monster,\u201d she said.I secured the necklace.\u201cWe all have to be something.\u201d\nVikram's a garden but Gauri's at least 12 gardens...a greenhouse... better and I want the kind of spine and dedication and ambition that her dreams came with. Gauri was such a strong character who's refused to cut out her thorns in order to be a better rose. She's learned to cultivate herself and drink her own sunlight and bared her teeth when she was being plucked at. But she also had her moments of vulnerabilty where she broke down the barriers around other people and allowed herself to be rose petals and shy smiles and blushing cheeks. It was just so lovely to see that it wasn't And she was certainly not perfect and she's come to learn that she's lived for so long in a vacuum state of mind where her actions were solely her own and existed for her without taking into accounts the prints they've left on other people's lives.\u2728 OTP!!\n\u201cHe turned to me, mischief glinting in his eyes. \u201cHow do they celebrate good fortune in Bharata? In Ujijain, we kiss.\u201d\u201cLook elsewhere.\u201d\u201cAre you sure? You spend an awful amount of time looking at my lips.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s only because I\u2019m horrified at the sheer idiocy of the words leaping out of them.\u201d\nthe moment I realized how hard I ship Vikram & Gauri was the moment I started to wonder where exactly it was that my life went so fucking downhilllisten, nothing is stronger than my undying love for the rivals-to-lovers trope, especially in this case when it starts off as \u201cyou don\u2019t trust me I don\u2019t trust you but we need each other to survive\u201d. I live for the kind of OTP where they both hate and annoy each other at every turn and have an overtly antagonistic relationship yet have more in common than they think so they end up forming a begrudging friendship that they would deny while still obviously caring about each other and eventually, they fall in mutually beneficial love where they subconsciously help each other become better people just by being together!! it fucks me up!!I honestly just love Gauri & Vikram so much. They're such a power couple. Two individuals who are equally strong and hardworking and worthy of respect at different things, and when you add them TOGETHER? fucking MAGICAL\u2728 AASHA\n\u201cExistence is the gift. Life is a choice.\u201d\ncongratulations to Aasha for having the least amount of book time in proportion to how much she crushed my fucking heart. She's just one of those people who are so full of warmth and light and generosity and if I were a fictional character, I would die just so the earth will be more nutritious and fertile and grow the best crops for her to dine on!! which is funny because she's one of the aformentioned poisonous courtesans who could hollow you out of your desires with only a soft touch... except she's never wanted to be. She's lived for a century feeling like she's existing in a fish tank watching everyone that's unlike her passing by with no possibility of really talking to any of them and if she only had one wish, would she trade power for freedom?p.s.

I would seriously read 200 extra pages describing everything further, no joke. The metaphors are amazing. I just love how her books have this wonderfully optimistic, whimsical, hopeful quality about them while still having a serious plot with realistic characters. And speaking of the characters... Gauri and Vikram were adorable. Their hate-to-love romance & witty banter were so amazing. They're easily two of my favorite characters now!There were SO many amazing quotes throughout the story, too. The writing was a bit different from The Star-Touched Queen, but that doesn't mean one was better or worse or anything. It just seemed like a new tone for a different story is all. But if TSSQ was a bit too abstract for your taste then maybe you'd still love this book -- it can easily be a standalone.

ACOW is very dear to my heart for many reasons. I don't think you need to read TSTQ to enjoy ACOW. They are sister tales about two sisters. And just like how knowing one sister in a family doesn't mean that you know the other, sometimes it gives you a little more depth and insight. Gauri and Vikram are characters that sprung to life for me. They've pestered me, legit walked *off* the page when I asked them to follow an outline, and also taught me so much not just at the crafts-level, but also on a human-level.

This was PHENOMENAL. Absolutely a new ALL TIME favorite. Can I give this one more than 5 stars please? I was a bit nervous going into this one because I had a hard time connecting with Roshani's first novel \"A Star Touched Queen.\" It was seriously a gorgeously written book but my brain just couldn't handle the complexity of the writing. I admired it but I just had a rough time understanding it.So, if you felt the same way and had a hard time with the first book- let me urge you to give this one a try. First of all, it is a companion novel so I don't think you even necessarily have to read or have understood the first. I wasn't lost at all. (But that doesn't mean you shouldn't give ASTQ a try.) Secondly, the writing in this was just as beautiful but easier to digest. The story is still a little abstract at times but I was never confused or lost. I LOVED EVERY SENTENCE. EVERY PAGE. I'm just still blown away and this is now one of my all time favorite books. You can bet I'll be rereading this over and over. Here's a list of reasons you need to read this book...1. Vikram (see below). 2. Magic.3. Hate to... love? You'll have to see ;) 4. Gorgeous scenery + culture5. HOLY CRAP FEELS.6. Princes. Okay Vikram. 7. Badass heroine (who is fierce, relatable, but makes mistakes.)8. Unpredictable plot9. Jaw dropping quotes10. This book is everything.Okay back to my review... What really made this shine was the characters. Oh my goodness they were so much fun. Gauri was a pleasant surprise - a princess in captivity but who doesn't cower before anyone. This girl has determination, strength, and guards her heart so carefully. She tends to be quite serious and doesn't accept fun easily. Which is perfect because it isn't long before she meets and attempts to kill Vikram (the Prince of the country she is captive in) who is witty, hysterical, and fun loving. Not only that, but he's brilliant. He can legit outsmart anyone. Oh and he's handsome. But trust me- that is merely the start of the story. Vikram and Gauri end up having to team up for a competition and things get so interesting. The best part though is their dynamic. They are polar opposites but they find out pretty quickly that they both have similar struggles and passions. Their banter was my favorite part. Vikram loves nothing more than to ruffle her feathers and I loved their chemistry.All the characters (even the side ones) are so complex and beautifully written. I was just so in love with everything. Where as the writing was hard for me to swallow in the last book- this one was just perfection.\n\n\"Humanity has nothing to do with what runs through your veins or shows up on your skin.\"\n\n I found myself rereading pages JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE SO GORGEOUS.\n\n\"How many times have answers been so simple and yet someone is determined to take the path of thorns instead of roses?\"\n\n(Okay I have so much more to add soon..)I honestly don't want to give anything else about the plot away. Let it be a surprise. Go in blind. This is all feels and pure fun. I have ZERO complaints. Not one. I can't even begin to count the amount of smiles it put on my face.

I even considered setting my rating to a 3.5 star bumped up to 4 stars rather than 3.5 rounded down to a 3, but I think a 4 star rating would be a bit generous and not very honest on my part so I'm just going to set my rating to 3 stars because that's what I feel reflects my true reading experience.Let me start off by saying that I was not a fan of The Star-Touched Queen. I wanted to so badly love it as much as I love Roshani as a person and an author but I just couldn't get into the story. Roshani has such beautiful, vivid, but sometimes, very verbose writing. I got lost in her words and descriptions and I wasn't actually able to follow the story at all. I had no doubts that The Star-Touched Queen was a beautiful tale and I desperately wished I was able to appreciate it more. But truth be told, after finally reading A Crown of Wishes, I think I've came to the conclusion that unfortunately, Roshani's books are just not for me. Or specifically, this series is just not for me.The characters Gauri and Vikram were great. Gauri was spunky and fearless. Vikram was determined and courageous. And together, they made such an ultimate pair. I loved their quick and witty banter and I loved their chemistry. I loved them more than Maya and Amar. The world that Roshani has created really sweeps you off your feet. There are just so many mystical creatures and places beyond our imaginations! And the Tournament was such an adventurous journey to go on.I loved almost everything in this book but why the three star rating, right? I've thought long and hard about this and that's how I came to the conclusion that maybe this series just wasn't for me. It had massive potential with many compelling characters and an intriguing plot, but I just couldn't get into either book... I was never really exciting or looking forward to the next page or the next chapter. I enjoyed the adventures and the romances but were never really invested in them. I loved ideas, concepts, and characters but at the same time... I didn't? I'm not sure if it makes sense. I guess I love the pieces but not the puzzle as a whole.It genuinely bums me out that I can't bring myself to love these stories. I love Roshani as a person and I really believe that she is a phenomenal writer whether or not I actually love her books. I know that many people will love The Star-Touched Queen and/or A Crown of Wishes more than I ever could and I still highly recommend them to my followers. These books may not have worked for me but I know that it may for a lot of other readers. Even if you didn't love or enjoy TSTQ, I think I that A Crown of Wishes deserves a chance because you might find yourself liking this one instead! I certainly enjoyed it more than I did TSTQ and was actually able to follow the story this time around with Gauri and Vikram as opposed to Maya and Amar in TSTQ. Though I personally didn't love A Crown of Wishes, I'll still be buying a finished copy and will always be looking forward to Roshani's future books."}, {"userName": "Nastassja", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7734134-nastassja", "userReview": "A crown of wishes is finally here! I love this story so much I feel like making every friend of mine read it. Yup, I am that unashamed *Grinch smile* You haven't started this book yet? What are you doing here?! Run, reader, run and start it right now :D *Thank you to St. Martin's Griffin and NetGalley for sending me a copy of this book!* \u201cA story had no ownership. A story could break its bones, grow wings, soar out of reach and dive out of sight in the time it took just to draw breath. It meant we weren\u2019t walking a cut path. We carved it into existence with every step.\u201dRoshani Chokshi is a queen of storytelling! Every word, every line is filled with exquisite magic. It feels like honey spreading through your veins and making your blood sing. Reading her books is a pleasure I find myself addicted to. It also doesn't hurt that books' covers are so gorgeous. This is how the author described A Crown of Wishes:There are feasts of silk birds, poisonous courtesans, strange rooms where desires can be devoured, thrones to be conquered, rakshasi fruit that turns princesses to beasts, and, of course, love.I wouldn't say better!This story is about a lonely Fox Prince. The world praises his mind and slyness, but would never accept him as a true ruler - only as a Puppet King. He is so sure of himself; he never doubts, he hides his hurt behind smirks and loopsided grins. And so he wishes: for magic to show him the way, to hope for something more, to own his fears, for power and recognition.This story is about a fierce girl - with blood on her lips and fangs in the heart, who wears the armor of silk and cosmetics as confident as she wears the armor of leather and chain mail. The \u2018Jewel of Bharata\u2019 they call her. She got so tangled up in court games that she one day lost herself. She hides her weaknesses, she strikes her enemies, but she looses. And so she wishes: for a chance to prove her worth, to shed her guilt, to save her people. A chance meeting. Reluctant allies. A tournament of wishes. Everything to gain and nothing left to lose. A Crown of wishes is many things in one. I liked The Star-touched Queen a lot, but I loved this one. The author found a perfect balance between story-characters-writing-wisdom and magic. Lovers of fast-paced, engaging plots will find this book entertaining, but characters is what really makes it shine brightly. Gauri and Vikram stole my heart from the first moment I met them. They deservedly take place among my all-time favorite book couples. Why couples, not characters? Because I can't imagine anything but a team when I think about them. Their shared scenes and interactions is what makes this book light and funny, but, at the same time, deep and sad. Gauri and Vikram felt real and flawed; they grow throughout the book: they make mistakes, they fall; they stand and move on but with every step they become someone new, someone better.Gauri is a fierce and strong warrior. Vikram, on the other hand, fights with his wits. Gauri places her faith only in herself. Vikram believes in magic. Two absolutely different people forced to work together in order to get their wishes. What to expect from such duet? ONE OF THE BEST CHARACTER DYNAMICS! Their banters are the best thing I've experienced in a while. \u201cWhat do I call you? \u201d he asked, turning to me. \u201cThe \u2018Jewelof Bharata\u2019 just seems too modest, don\u2019t you think? \u201d\u201cCall me Gauri.\u201d\u201cHow intimate.\u201dI glared. \u201cEnjoy it, because that\u2019s as intimate as this will ever get, Fox Prince.\u201d When they first meet, they do not hesitate to threaten the other. They don't value each other's lives; after all they are from two warring Kingdoms. But time passes, bonds grow tighter and THAT transformation from enemies to more is EVERYTHING. But if you think their banters will cease after they grow closer - don't be fooled, they'll become only better, hehe. Ah, how I wish I could share every dialog of theirs with you; I highlighted practically the whole book, and I feel like running re-reading those passages already, though, I finished reading it only a couple of hours ago! Oh, and there's also a scene with shirtless Vikram reading a book! Aahh, I believe I thought myself in paradise when I read that scene, haha. Sorry for the little fangirl excursus, I needed to share that awesome scene with the whole world *grins*. A Crown of wishes is a story filled with wisdom. I admire, once more, how unique and beautiful the world author created. I know little about Indian (Hindi) culture, but it felt authentic to me in this book. And it's not only about one culture: Roshani Chokshi added something from the western mythology as well, flavoring the story with richness. It doesn't feel just like an entertaining story, it feels like a story that teaches you something valuable. The writing is so beautiful, I couldn't stop myself from reading some passage aloud or re-reading some - so beautiful and melodic they were. All in all, A Crown of Wishes is better and richer than its predecessor. If you didn't enjoy The Star-touched Queen, I would strongly recommend you, my friends, to give this book a chance: I am sure it will surprise you in more ways than one. This story left a deep imprint on me and it is, for sure, became on of my favorites. It has everything a reader can want in a book: an engaging and magical story (there's per se something irresistible about magical tournaments, e.g. Caraval, A Gathering of Shadows), three-dimensional characters with fantastic dynamics, exquisite writing that transfers you into the world of wishes you've never visited before, well-rounded secondary characters which, for once, play an important role in the story. It was a nice bonus to find myself caring for someone apart from our main characters. I wish I had enough words to express how deeply I enjoyed this story. I can only hope that when the book is out in the world in March, you will wish to read it, my friends."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030788-melanie", "userReview": "1.) The Star-Touched Queen \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\u201cA story had no ownership. A story could break its bones, grow wings, soar out of reach and dive out of sight in the time it took just to draw breath. It meant we weren't walking a cut path. We carved it into existence with every step.\u201d\n\nThis was utterly enchanting and completely mesmerizing. I loved The Star-Touched Queen when I read it last year, and this story was even better! Yet, this story also made me fall deeper in love with The Star-Touched Queen, because some of the crossovers just warmed my heart to no end. This was such a beautiful tale, and I completely recommend this to everyone, but especially story lovers, because A Crown of Wishes is a lover letter to story lovers everywhere. This is a companion novel to The Star-Touched Queen, so you do not need to read The Star-Touched Queen before reading this amazing little standalone, but I would completely recommend it. I mean, more tears of joy and sadness if you do! A Crown of Wishes stars a character that we were first introduced to in The Star-Touched Queen, Gauri, the jewel of Bharata, now a princess awaiting her death. Her path soon crosses with Vikram, an adopted prince from Ujijain, who is also nicknamed The Fox Prince, who is trying to run away from the memories of his past.The story truly starts off when Vikram is invited to compete in the Tournament of Wishes, which is held in the otherworldly realm of Alaka, and which the Lord of Treasures hosts. This tournament is said to just be myth, but Vikram soon learns that it is very real, and if you win the tournament you will be granted any wish in the world. Yet, there is a stipulation; he needs a partner. \n\n\u201cFind the one who glows, with blood on the lips and fangs in the heart.\u201d\n\nAnd the greater powers at work lead him to Gauri. Gauri is so strong and fierce, yet she shows how different women are strong in different ways. And how you don\u2019t always have to draw your power from your ability to fight with a sword or dagger, but to craft a weapon and draw your power for whatever the situation calls for, whether it be beauty, or friends, or taking a risk that you never thought you\u2019d have the strength for. I loved Gauri so much. She was such a wonderful main character, and I want to build a garden in her honor, too. \n\n\u201cI donned my armor, lining my eyes with kohl until they were dark as death and patting crushed rose petals on my lips until they were scarlet as blood.\u201d\n\nWhile Gauri and Vikram are competing, they meet a plethora of cool side characters along the way, but Aasha is the one we get to spend the most time with. And she also gets her own point of view. Aasha is a bisexual icon, and she was probably my favorite character (which is really saying something, because this cast is honestly 10/10 phenomenal!) Aasha and her sisters are poisonous courtesans who are forced into a life of seclusion. Aasha is thankful for her sisters who saved her when she was young, and who have become her found family, but Aasha wants to explore, and have adventures, and see more of the world. This is a story about a magical tournament, with romance and laughter, but this is also a story about trauma and grief and how sometimes being honest about our pasts is the hardest thing we will ever do. I felt so much empathy for these three characters, and I felt that empathy so very differently and so very similarly at the same time. This story is perfectly crafted.Roshani expertly wove this tale with some of the most beautiful writing my eyes have ever read. This writing is lush, and descriptive, and so very lyrical. I honestly feel like I tabbed every other page, and if I were reading on my kindle, I would have highlighted half the book.

Roshani Chokshi's way with words blows my mind. She creates such beautiful angelic sentences that have memorized. The characters are ones that I LOVE and although I adored the characters in TSTQ, I loved these even more (yet again how is that even possible). I even loved the romance more in this book. Since TSTQ was her debut novel, you can really see how much she has changed as an author. I give so much credit to her because she really took the feedback she received from reviewers. I read this book in public multiple times and had to contain myself because I didn't want to look crazy but this book had me going through so many different emotions and towards the end, I even cried in public (not even ashamed of it). After reading this book I can say that Roshani Chokshi has become one of my favorite authors and I will choose to support her with whatever books she comes out with.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK IS MY BABY <3Also immediately after finishing this I reread it again because I just couldn't help myself__________________________________Can it be March 28th 2017 already?"}, {"userName": "sreeja (semi-hiatus)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50309540-sreeja-semi-hiatus", "userReview": "\u201cLove is like Death without the guarantee of its arrival.

I was honestly screaming throughout this book because finally the Indian culture was properly explored and I even saw bits of stories and folktales that I used to read back when I was a kid. Let me just start by saying that I was not the biggest fan of The Star Touched Queen and it was probably my biggest letdown of last year. It had shitty characters no development and the plot was painfully slow moving. But what that book lacked this one totally made up for it this was so beautiful and magical. I was totally hooked into the story from the first chapter and the beauty of it. Holy crap, the writing was amazing. TBH sometimes it might start getting a little bit too flowery but I didn\u2019t really mind because the plot was amazing.Let me just list (because I love lists) the reasons why you absolutely need to pick up this book. (EVEN if you didn\u2019t really like the first one):a)\tSETTINGS + descriptions + the general feelEverything in this was so magical. I don\u2019t know whether it was just me feeling nostalgic but I finally felt like I could connect to the world in this book and I\u2019m so glad I could. The way that it is written just honestly took my breath away at some points. The settings were described so vividly I could almost imagine them. \n\n\nb)\tIndian CultureIDK I\u2019m actually quite happy with this book and its take on the culture and it was shown beautifully and AAAA. It was much better explored in this book than the previous one which literally gave no information on anything culture-related whatsoever.\n\nc)\tthe plot& the tournamentI felt that the plot of this was really fun. I MEAN yes its quite clich\u00e9 but I just kept my mind open and read it and really loved it. Honestly when the vetala came in I was just there like #sh00k because the story of Vikram& Vetala was one of my favourites as a kid. This book was much much much more fast paced and adventurous than the first one. The whole tournament was filled with dangerous creatures (OMG I love the vishkanyas, I used to love hearing about their stories when I was younger) and the plot was a huge improvement from the last book.d)\tGauri\n\nI am so happy to say that I loved this character so much and she was way less whiny and way less stupid than Maya from TSTQ. Her willpower and her strength was so endearing and just the way she met Vikram. She was a very badass character although I would have liked to see more scenes where she had to show off her skills with weapons and everything. But otherwise she was an amazing protagonist and I loved rooting for her throughout this book.e)\tVIKRAM\nOMG I LOVED THIS GUY. He was so witty and funny and so incredibly intelligent. I loved that he was the whole brains in the duo while Gauri was more of the brawn. He was so sweet and his backstory was very touching. I loved his whole reason for wanting to take part in the tournament and he was honestly the best thing in this book. OKAY overall this book was beautiful and fast-paced and magical. Please im on my knees you guys need to read this!!Pre-review:HONESTLY SO HAPPY I GAVE ROSHANI CHOKSHI'S BOOKS A SECOND CHANCEidk i didn't really like the star touched queen #whoops but i loved every page of this one its so beautiful& also the indian kid inside me is super happy with all the myth and magic in this RTC"}, {"userName": "maymay\u2740", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49148508-maymay", "userReview": "Things this book promised me:1.\tSnarky ship that will own my heart2.\tCaptivating, enchanting plot Things this book delivered:1.\tSnarky ship that owns my heart So, was this book good?

So every time I would pick up this beauty to read it, I\u2019d get distracted or start to fall asleep\u2026on the prologue. It was clear to me I wasn\u2019t going to be able to read this book while in the height of my pregnancy. I did, however, get to finish it two days before I went into labor! So here I am, finally writing a review for this crazy, intricate book.\n\u201cThe problem with guilt was not how it attacks the present, but how it stained the past. \nI can\u2019t say there weren\u2019t moments where I was scratching my head-because I did that a lot. But it was never in a bad way. This author, from what I\u2019ve always heard, writes in a deeply poetic way that you just need to be in the mindset for-I definitely gathered this from the moment I started. This isn\u2019t your average YA fantasy-I feel it\u2019s a bit deeper than that. Keep that in mind when choosing to start this novel-it completely changes the tone of both the book and how you feel whilst enjoying this story.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a monster,\u201d she said.\u00a0I secured the necklace. \u201cWe all have to be something.\u201d\nWhen I think back on why I enjoyed this book so much (I read it almost a month ago) it always goes back to the characters. I had heard so many good things from my close friends that loved this book about the witty Vikram and I took that with a grain of salt-I mean, no book boy is ever really as good as people say (Okay, whatever\u2026I lie, but still-everyone\u2019s perception is different) and I almost always feel a tad different. Now, whether that means I loved them more or less is dependent upon the book-obviously.\nVikram had tried bribing them. At one point, he offered Gauri\u2019s hand in marriage, which earned him two sharp jabs in the ribs. For equality\u2019s sake, he offered his own hand in marriage, but that ended all bargaining negotiations on the spot. \nSo, when thinking of this story, did I love Vikram as much as others? Absolutely. Did I obsess over him as much as my friends? Perhaps not-but he became an instant BBF all the same. Ha, just goes to show I\u2019ll never change. I had thought he was supposed to be tortured and somewhat sullen, almost an enemies to lovers type deal, but turns out that wasn\u2019t the case. She hated him, but he was just cautious of her-you know, because she is from a different kingdom and all. No, he was a sarcastic prince that made me smile from ear to ear, laugh at the most random moments\u2026.did I mention I have a prince fetish? Oops.\n\u201cI prefer the poisoned food.\u201d\u00a0\u201cYou may be rewarded yet,\u201d he said. He popped a handful of pomegranate seeds in his mouth. He froze, some of the juice spilling from his lips. \u201cOh no,\u201d he breathed, clutching his chest.\u00a0\u201cVikram!\u201d I screamed.\u00a0He held up his hand. \u201cI meant to start with mangos.\u201d\nSo it\u2019s extremely obvious that this book wasn\u2019t so much about the plot, for me, but the characters. It was a bit obscure, in my opinion, so I took solace in the characters\u2019 hilarious banter and romantic interactions. Vikram and Gauri had the best banter I\u2019ve read in a while, holding up to some of my favorite bantering couples-it made this long book seem like it was over in a minute. \n\u201cMy apologies. Is it your bellicose-let-me-drain-your-blood face? Could you not master an expression that looked less like an outraged cat? \u201d\u00a0\u201cBetter than steepling my hands and looking like an overgrown spider.\u201d\u00a0\"An overgrown spider who is rarely wrong.\u201d\u00a0\"My bellicose-let-me-drain-your-blood face has saved your life.\u201d\u00a0\u201cAnd this overgrown-spider pose is about to save yours.\u201d\nBut Gauri is probably the base of why this book was so alluring-Vikram opposed her and was sly as can be\u2026but I think he was much more tolerable in the beginning of their uneasy alliance (and nicer sooner) whereas Gauri made it harder. She was constantly on alert, always threatening him and, in her mind, thinking of ways to be rid of him (ohhh but he was too cunning). This added an extra layer of animosity between the two, adding tension and a romantic build up that pays off greatly in the end. \n\u201cI thought you were going to stay away from me,\u201d she said.\u00a0He looked at her, this princess who seemed so dangerously sharp that he might cut himself just brushing against her shadow. \u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d \nAnd while the characters were the main draw to the story, for me, the story wasn\u2019t without its addictive elements, as well-obviously. My biggest problem stems from the games. I do agree with my friend, Brittney, that this almost has a Caraval type feel. And while that\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t know that I was in the mood for games that aren\u2019t in fact\u2026games. \n She laughed. And Vikram, who had never wanted for his life to slow down but only to move faster and faster to the next thing, found himself craving to live in this second. \nWhatever. Call me a square, but I love structured, clear cut games and tournaments in books. I don\u2019t like when the games aren\u2019t clear and when they don\u2019t have clear cut rules, winners, prizes etc. etc. Or, I don\u2019t know, I love the life and death games (Sorry. I\u2019ll just always be a HG type girl\u2026). In this story, I felt the games, and the plot, for that matter, were a bit obscure. And, frankly, I don\u2019t always love obscure. As was the case with Caraval, though, I did enjoy it here-I just don\u2019t know that I expected it-Which, hey, isn\u2019t this book\u2019s fault, now is it??One final thing-I\u2019m not a fan of one person being a certain pov and the other being in a totally different pov. I don\u2019t know why it bothers me, but every time it switched I thought about it, and I just don\u2019t like this minuscule distraction-I\u2019m not sure what the point is, but for some reason it happens a lot in stories. I\u2019m one of the few who can\u2019t see past it. I still loved the story, it just served as a distraction I didn\u2019t love.\n\u201cSurviving isn\u2019t just about cutting out your heart and burning every feeling into ash,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it means taking whatever is thrown at you, beautiful or grotesque, poisonous or blissful, and carving out your life with the pieces you\u2019re given.\u201d\nA wonderful story full of twists and turns, games that leave your mind reeling, banter and a slow burn romance that is totally worth the wait, and writing that immediately enthralls you, this story is a winner. It\u2019s hard to say whether this book will be for everyone, but its promising enough I would suggest everyone give it a try. The characters are worth every page you choose to read, and, frankly, Vikram is worth more than that. I hate that it took me so long to read this ARC, but I\u2019m just glad I\u2019m fulfilling my duty. This book was worth the wait, and I\u2019m glad I can voice just how fun it was-this is not one I\u2019ll soon forget. **ARC provided by St. Martin's Griffin in exchange for an honest review**For more of my reviews, please visit:\n\n \n \n \n \n\n**Going to try and finish this before the baby comes !! :P**OMG I GOT THE ARC!!Thank you to some wonderful publishers! :P (And Brittney for forcing me to look into this book lol)"}, {"userName": "Fables&Wren", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42780417-fables-wren", "userReview": "WrensReads Review:Whenever you think of Wonderland or Neverland or just anything stupid-beautiful, this book should be the first thing that comes to mind. Actually no, anything Roshani Chokshi has written is stupid-beautiful. It feels like a poem had a baby with a fantasy and out came Chokshi's books. The way she makes you see things is something you will get completely lost in. I found myself wanting to read more of the magical place she pieced together.Caraval and The Night Circus are two other books that I would compare to this marvelous book. If you loved The Star-Touched Queen, just know that this was written a little differently. I myself had a little bit of a hard time piecing things together in The Star-Touched Queen because I was so distracted by how much description and beautiful sentences there were. But, I did end up loving it, and you can see my review for it here. You should know that the writing is different between these two books, so you may find yourself in love with it.You technically don't even have to read The Star-Touched Queen in order to read this book, since it was a companion novel, though I highly recommend that you do. I learned the hard way with Leigh Bardugo's books that even though you can technically read a series (Six of Crows) without reading the previous series (Grisha), doesn't mean that you should. There are hints about The Star Touched Queen through out the book that will make you smile, but the fixed-content itself is completely separate. So the characters in this book are what made it so much better to me. You have two royals thrown together in a quest to win a wondrous price. Both have completely different ideas on what to do with the price, but that doesn't stop them from regrettably working together. One is a princess named Gauri that is being held captive by the country that Prince Vikram will rule. They are polar opposites not only in country but in spirit too. Where Vikram has wit, Gauri has has determination and strength. Where Vikram has spur of the moment, Gauri has ponder and thought out. Gauri is more serious and Vikram loves that (because how else is a prince going to stay entertained on a quest?).You meet different types of beings in this book and just learn a lot more of this beautiful land Chokshi has brought before us. She deserves all the publicity and praise she is going to get with this book.

This is the kind of book that feels enchanting, comforting, funny, endearing, romantic - and will leave you with a huge smile on your face!This book is a companion novel to the previous book by Roshani Chokshi, The Star-Touched Queen - so, it's not exactly a sequel. The main characters of \"A Crown of Wishes\" are different ones - they have appeared or were mentioned briefly in the first book, but I don't think you need to read that first novel to read this. \"A Crown of Wishes\" can stand alone. But there are a few things that come up that might need having some kind of background info on the other book.I have to admit, I wasn't a fan of the first book, \"The Star Touched Queen.\" I still don't know why that book didn't work for me - I stopped halfway. But this one clicked with me in so many ways the first didn't. \nPlot summary:\n \n\n\"Play the game and you may yet win your kingdom, not just the husk of its name.\"\n\nA story about a prince and princess of enemy kingdoms, who have to become partners to compete in a magical tournament to fulfill each of their wishes to truly gain the thrones to their respective kingdoms. Even through facing magical tricks and demonic creatures, there's also the challenge of getting along - and their personal journey together throughout this enchanting and terrifying world is what makes this novel so special!\nWorld-building:\n \n\n\"What was magic anyway, but the world beheld by someone who chose to see it differently?\"\n\nThe fantastical \"Otherworld\" in this novel is almost dreamlike in its strangeness. There is a magical forest, and the \"Night Bazaar\", but mostly the story takes place in \"Alaka\" - the mythical City of Treasures and Wealth, where the the tournament is held. The place is unpredictable and like something out of a dream, or sometimes a nightmare. I usually like it when there's more structure in a world (and the magic in it) to grasp it clearly. But while I struggled with TSTQ, I think this book struck the right balance between presenting rich and whimsical fantasy settings - and grounding it with strong and gripping character development. *I really liked all the magical elements and creatures introduced! I'm a huge fan of Indian cinema but the genres rarely ever offer myth and fantasy, so it was fun and fascinating to delve into this world with creatures like the Vanaras (human-sized monkeys), Vetalas (spirits inhabiting dead bodies - icky but strangely quirky in the book), Nagas (half serpent), Yakshas (nature spirits) - and my favorite were the Vishakanyas: courtesan-like women with poison in their blood that can kill a human with a touch. *And not just the fantasy - I love the feel and hints of Indian culture being more present in this book. My knowledge is very limited of it, but I still enjoyed all the mentions of the food, the clothing, the names and terms, the holidays, and just the entire feel is so inviting! I look forward to more books that present different cultures and settings like this one does so beautifully.\nCharacters:\n\n\n\u201cFind the one who glows, with blood on the lips and fangs in the heart.\u201d\n\nMy ability to connect with a book is always dependent on how much the characters resonate with me. And this book surprised in the absolute best of ways by being so character-driven!! The characters in this book are the heart and soul of the story. Gauri, \"The Jewel of Bharata\" is a warrior princess in every sense. \n\n\"Death might be waiting, but I was going to be a queen. I would have my throne if I had to carve a path of blood and bone to get it back. Death could wait.\"\n\nShe is strong and fierce but her armor is one built out of sacrifice and burdens she's had to bear while protecting herself and her people throughout her tyrannical brother's reign. Her mounting guilt, her hesitance to accept weakness, her distrust, her vulnerability - everything about the character made her so easy to feel for, and root for every step of the way. Vikram, \"The Fox Prince\", is the clever and cunning prince of Ujijain. Not a blood heir to his empire, he's spent his life trying to prove himself capable of being the empire's true ruler - but is instead is promised to be nothing more than a \"puppet king\" by the scorning council. But his belief and hope in magic leads him to an invitation to the tournament and the possibility of gaining true acknowledgment in his role as emperor. \n\n\"He was raised on a bellyful of want\u2014always kept at a distance, always in sight of everything he wanted and could never sink his teeth into\u2014which only made him that much more attuned to seeing through words and straight to the desires.\"\n\nNow Vikram is the character that surprised me most! In the absolute best and most amazing ways!!! If you take a look at my status updates, you'll see they are 90% Vikram quotes and moments!In \"The Star Touched Queen\", the vague mentions of him gave me the impression he would be a brooding warrior. But he turned out to be such an interestingly fun, sly, curious, and all around awesome character - one who depends on his wits rather than muscle to get by. And his wonderful quirks and mischievous antics made him even more likable - there were hilarious moments. Like his confidence and willingness to do whatever it takes - even dress as a courtesan - to get to where and what he wants:\n\n\"Once, when he was ten, he attempted to fly by attaching silk scarves to his arms and leaping from a tree. It did not work. When he was fifteen, he dressed like a courtesan to sneak into the harem. He ended up appearing too convincing to a palace guard and was forced to throw off his silks and punch the man. All things considered, this was not the most shameful thing he had endured.\"\n\nA total darling who will also make you swoon! ((And what else - I googled the character's full name \"Vikramaditya\" to see if the author used any inspirational figure, and I love what I found. So, apparently \"Vikramaditya\" is known as a legendary emperor of Ancient India - the capital being \"Ujjain\" (so, definitely the inspiration for Ujijain!). There seems to be lots of stories and fantastical legends about him (including Vetalas like in this book!), and according to wiki - he's characterized as the \"ideal king\" and is either inspired by a true historical figure or is purely a mythical character. So, basically, he's kind of like India's own King Arthur!! So cool!))Vikram and Gauri start as two opposites forced to work together - he with his sunny optimism and she, her no-nonsense wariness of everything. I love how this book strayed from the usual - when in danger, the girl reaches for her weapons while the guy thinks up a scheme. They ended up making such an amazing team!But of course, first, their contrasting personalities resulted in continuous banter, sarcasm, bickering, teasing, -- all entertaining and wonderful things!\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re certain that rakshasi fruit is out of your system?\u201d asked Vikram. \"Yes?\u201d \"Good.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cBecause, once more, I told you so.\u201d \"You do realize that I don\u2019t need the enhancements of demon fruit to knock you to the ground?\u201d \"I do. But I concede that some bodily harm from you is inevitable. I\u2019m just trying to minimize the damage.\u201d \"How very wise,\u201d I said, rolling my eyes.\n\nOne more:\n(Vikram): \"Have some faith.\u201d(Gauri): \"Between faith and distrust, which one is more likely to keep you alive?\u201d \"And which one is more likely to let you experience living?\u201d I threw up my hands. \u201cWhy is everything so philosophical with you?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI like thinking.\u201d\nThey have such a great dynamic - going from enemies, to tentative partners, to friends and then slowly to something so much deeper. I can't separate talking about \nThe Romance\n from \nThe Character Development\n in this book - because the characters grow and connect together throughout the journey. There is such an amazing depth to how the characters each evolve but also a convincingly gradual pace to it. And it's the same perfect balance with their feelings for each other - they get to see and accept one another's own pains, and they influence each other in the best way. The romantic arc is filled with both light and meaningful moments - so perfect! \n\nI didn\u2019t want to cut out my heart. I wanted to give it. Freely and without feeling as if it would be turned into a weapon against me. I wanted freedom to thaw me, to let it break the walls Skanda\u2019s rule had forced me to build. I wanted the privilege of weakness.\n\nI don't think I've loved two characters (and a romantic couple!) this much since Arin and Kestrel from the Winner's trilogy! Vikram and Gauri are as unforgettable, and have also set the bar high for other YA couples in the next books I'll read! Another amazing character is Aasha - the Vishakanya who yearns to know want it's like to be the human she could have been! Aasha is sort of a sad character - her story reminiscent of \"The Little Mermaid\". And she becomes an ally to Vikram and Gauri. I especially loved the friendship and understanding that develops between her and Gauri - and it's not an easy thing with Gauri's distrusting nature.\nThe writing:\n\n\n\"I\u2019d almost forgotten the true power of a story \u2026 how it lulled you outside your thoughts, let you process the world in a way that was palatable. Not poisonous. Calm rushed through me.\"\n\nI cannot say enough how absolutely gorgeous the writing is! You need to read the book for yourself to experience it! Just as magical as the fantasy!And I also didn't notice until a while into the book that Gauri's chapters were in first-person point-of-view, and Vikram's in third-person! I don't why, but that worked so well!* I don't really have any criticisms on the book. Every one I come up with has more to do with my personal preferences than an actual flaw in the book. But I think the book could be a bit more suspenseful - the game itself rarely felt \"competitive\" (but I think it was supposed to be an unpredictable personal challenge for the characters), or maybe because some elements of the background stories felt elusive or irrelevant (there were a few myths that were strung together vaguely). But then again, I think all that was intentional and part of the book's charm...\nOverall\n -- I wholly recommend this book! If you're looking for an exotic and magical fantasy, you've got it. If you're looking for complex and interesting characters, they're there. If you're looking for a fun and slow-burn romance, look no further. If you're looking for beautiful unforgettable writing, you'll definitely get that! And if you just want a great book to escape into - this is it!"}, {"userName": "Alyssa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8472395-alyssa", "userReview": "Better than the first book. Even if I'm given them the same overall rating. This one was better.***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***A Crown of Wishes by Roshani ChokshiBook Two of The Star-Touched Queen seriesPublisher: St. Martin's GriffinPublication Date: March 28, 2017Rating: 4 starsSource: eARC from NetGalleySummary (from Goodreads):Gauri, the princess of Bharata, has been taken as a prisoner of war by her kingdom\u2019s enemies. Faced with a future of exile and scorn, Gauri has nothing left to lose. Hope unexpectedly comes in the form of Vikram, the cunning prince of a neighboring land and her sworn enemy kingdom. Unsatisfied with becoming a mere puppet king, Vikram offers Gauri a chance to win back her kingdom in exchange for her battle prowess. Together, they\u2019ll have to set aside their differences and team up to win the Tournament of Wishes\u2014a competition held in a mythical city where the Lord of Wealth promises a wish to the victor.Reaching the tournament is just the beginning. Once they arrive, danger takes on new shapes: poisonous courtesans and mischievous story birds, a feast of fears and twisted fairy revels.Every which way they turn new trials will test their wit and strength. But what Gauri and Vikram will soon discover is that there\u2019s nothing more dangerous than what they most desire.What I Liked:Last year, I read The Star-Touched Queen and while I enjoyed it overall, I didn't love it like most people did. It was a wonderful story, but I wanted the hero to be less one-dimensional, and I wanted the romance to be more direct and present. I am extremely pleased with A Crown of Wishes because it has everything I liked in The Star-Touched Queen - AND the issues I had with The Star-Touched Queen are not present in this book. I liked A Crown of Wishes more than The Star-Touched Queen, and I think it is better than its predecessor.Vikram has always known that he will inherit the throne of Ujijaiin but he will only ever be a puppet Emperor. The council has never treated him like a full-blood prince - given that he was adopted by the Emperor. When Vikram is invited to play in the Tournament of Wishes, he does not refuse. He must find a partner, and that leads him to Gauri. Gauri, princess of Bharata, has been a prisoner for months. When the prince of an enemy kingdom offers freedom in exchange for her being his partner in a deadly and magical game, she accepts, hoping to kill him and be rid of him quickly. But they discover that they needed each other more than they realized, if they want to make it out of the Tournament alive, and win. The prize is a wish for any victor, and both Vikram and Gauri have desires born of their cruel pasts. But desires are dangerous, just as dangerous as secrets.One thing that I was extremely excited to discover is that this book is written in dual POV - we get Gauri's first-person POV, and Vikram's third-person POV. I complained about how I thought Amar felt so one-dimensional, in The Star-Touched Queen. Well, that problem was very, very fixed in this book, given the second POV (Vikram's).I'll start with Vikram, since the story starts with Vikram. I would argue that this book is just as much Vikram's as it is Gauri's - she does not hold the spotlight. Vikram is the Fox Prince, an eighteen-year-old prince who is clever and very intelligent. He is not a warrior, and he doesn't even carry weapons. That surprised me, because what prince in any world (made-up or real) isn't trained to be a warrior? I liked that Vikram is different in that sense - he isn't an alpha, he isn't a warrior. He isn't a passive, scared boy either. I love how clever he is, and how he is so patient and steady.Gauri, on the other hand, is a warrior princess. She is brash and bold and wild. She wants her throne, and she is determined to get it, doing whatever it takes. Gauri is the \"alpha\" in this story, the one who demands and takes and bosses. I liked her a lot because I could see parts of myself in her. She isn't cold-hearted like many believe her to be (like she believes herself to be). There is more to Gauri than the Jewel, the princess of Bharata, the warrior. The two of them together is like fire and ice. They antagonize each other, needle each other, irritate each other, but they stick together, save each other's lives, and look out for each other. Their friendship (at first it's friendship) is a slow-growing thing that doesn't have the best start. But I liked seeing them grow to care for each other, and then I liked seeing that turn into something else.This book isn't a necessarily a romance, but I loved the romance. I loved how Vikram and Gauri's romance is a slow-burn one that is also more direct and strong than the romance in The Star-Touched Queen. Neither character here plays games with each other, or runs from each other. Rather, they learn each other and find their way. Even with Gauri's emotional and mental armor, and Vikram's selflessness, the pair never shy away from each other. It's a sweet romance.This story is so much fun to read! Fun, and sometimes heartbreaking, but a lot of fun and sometimes hilarious. Vikram and Gauri travel to the Otherworld in order to try to win a wish for themselves. They must complete several tasks, and also try to stay alive. The tasks require both of their strengths, and for them to overcome their weaknesses and fears. This story is so thorough and engrossing - you'll feel like you've read a lifetime's worth of a story, and not a month's worth.Also, props to the author for doing such good research and/or including so much of her culture in this book. As an Indian girl, I can't tell you how happy it makes me to read a book that features aspects of Indian culture, written by an Indian author. Chokshi does a lovely job with the Indian influences she incorporates in the story. Masterful storytelling and writing, as always. I think everyone agreed that the writing of The Star-Touched Queen was phenomenal. The author gets even better, in this book. I love how lush her writing is! Also I have to say, I love how many food references there were. So. Much. Food.I won't say anything more because I don't want to spoil anything, but I really enjoyed this book. I loved the dual POVs, the character development, the romance, the Tournament. The ending is PERFECT. Trust me, it's a great ending, and it's so satisfying. I'd love to know the logistics of a certain aspects of the ending, but maybe the author will write an epilogue. Or a book three...?What I Did Not Like:I honestly can't think of anything to write about here! The author \"fixed\" the issues I had in book one, so I'm pretty satisfied. Maybe seeing Gauri feel more guilty over a certain aspect of the ending? It was her fault, in any case. Let me keep quiet!Would I Recommend It:I recommend this book, whether you liked The Star-Touched Queen or not, whether you read The Star-Touched Queen or not. Remember, I liked it but didn't totally love it like many people did. I can safely say that this book was (even) better. This book is full of great diversity, rich culture, and lovely storytelling and writing. And a gorgeous cover!Rating:4.5 stars. I'm rounding to 4 stars which is technically the same rating I gave The Star-Touched Queen, but know that I liked this book more. Both books had a tough and admirable heroine, but I think the inclusion of Vikram's POV and the stronger romance made this companion sequel a better book than The Star-Touched Queen! Pre-read squees:WOW WOW WOWIE CHECK OUT THAT COVER!!!! I love it even more than The Star-Touched Queen's!!!"}, {"userName": "Luke Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30710594-luke-taylor", "userReview": "So what is A Crown of Wishes?It is a carefully-crafted creation of hopes and fears, subtly laced with winsome romance and witty humor, ineffable charms and incredible challenges, each world-building word building upon itself with the precise and ancient symmetry of a mystic maze-like mandala until one realizes they've crossed the magical barrier between reading and reality, where Roshani Chokshi grants the reader the truest wish of their heart by fulfilling the very purpose of the story itself.Roshani's one-of-a-kind talents sing through angelic prose as imagination unleashed floods the mind with the most fantastic of fantasy environments, so inherently and indelibly Indian-inspired, so rich with color and flavor, depth and darkness, dimension and detail, a world that can be enjoyed over and over again at any pace, (Tarsem Singh, PLEASE ADAPT THESE BOOKS TO FILM!) where absolutely nothing is impossible, including the breaking of promises, wills, rules, bones, and hearts, through the perfectly magical veil of whimsy, warfare, wit and wisdom.Setting herself forth as a true master, Roshani's story-telling soul has not only proven to be powerful and limitless, but brutally honest and deeply personal, speaking to me in a way that it seems no other writer ever has or ever can, and not only did this book draw tears from me, it made me realize that this, this my friends, this so so so special story can only be enjoyed to the fullest when shared with someone so very very special to you, and I was so thankful to share the reading and deep enjoyment of this story with the amazing Svetlana.My deepest thanks to Roshani for the signed and personalized hardcover and for taking the time and effort and every precious fractal of fictional magic involved to make such a beautiful and wonderful story and my deepest thanks to Svetlana for sharing such a rich and rewarding reading experience with me.Recommended for everyone."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "4 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum https://bibliosanctum.com/2017/05/21/...I picked up A Crown of Wishes after the fantastic read that was The Star-Touched Queen, and I\u2019m glad I did. This is despite the book being a companion novel rather than a true sequel, because while the two may feature different stories and characters, they are the same in all the ways that count \u2013 in their creative vision and excellence.Once upon a time in a kingdom called Ujijain there lived a prince named Vikram. Known as the Fox Prince, he was offered a chance to compete in the mysterious Tournament of Wishes held in the otherworldly realm of Alaka, city of Treasures and Wealth. It is said that winner will be granted any wish they desire\u2014and being the adopted son of the emperor and merely regarded as a puppet prince, Vikram thinks he knows what it is he will ask for should he prevail. But first, he\u2019s going to have to find a partner.Enter Gauri, a warrior princess who attempted a coup against her tyrannical brother and failed. Now she is in exile and a prisoner of war, captured by her kingdom\u2019s enemies and facing death. In Vikram\u2019s eyes, however, she is the ideal teammate\u2014fierce, strong, and powerful, she\u2019s the perfect complement to his wit and cunning. Gauri, on the other hand, is less than impressed with Vikram\u2019s naivet\u00e9 and lack of fighting ability, and yet, if it\u2019s a choice between execution and going off on a wild goose chase with some strange fool prince, she knows which option she\u2019s going to pick. So together they team up and head off to Alaka, with every confidence that they will emerge victorious. But upon their arrival in the otherworld, Gauri realizes that the two of them may have gotten in way over their heads. Things work differently here than in the real world, with dangers taking new forms. Curses and other magical or supernatural threats abound, twisting their aspirations into desperation and destruction.While I was reading, I just couldn\u2019t help but think this is the book I wish Caraval had been. Thematically they are very similar, each novel featuring an otherworldly, magical competition at its center. The difference is, The Crown of Wishes does it so much better. In contrast to the frenetic, almost random structure of Caraval, this one instead features an organized, well thought out plotline which gradually expands beyond the two protagonists\u2019 personal stories. In some ways, it reminded me of a series of integrated folk tales, focusing on Gauri and Vikram as they discover more about themselves and each other with the completion of each challenge. Not surprisingly, the end result is a book that feels significantly more impactful and emotionally complex.Ultimately I gave The Crown of Wishes the same rating as I did The Star-Touched Queen, because I enjoyed both books equally. But just as the original does some things better, there are likewise areas where the follow-up tops its predecessor. Those who thought the pacing was too slow in the first book will probably find this to be less of a problem in The Crown of Wishes, for example. It is a much more action-oriented and plot-driven book, with sustained high levels of excitement as the tournament progresses through its various stages.I also preferred the relationship dynamics between the main characters here, over the one between Maya and Amar in The Star-Touched Queen. In a word, Vikram and Gauri were adorable. While a love story like theirs is in no way unique in YA, I feel Roshani Chokshi deserves a tremendous amount of credit for her gift in dialogue writing. On not once but several occasions, I found myself smiling at the cleverness and sharp humor in the characters\u2019 back-and-forth banter, and that is a rare thing for me indeed. There\u2019s a sense of real chemistry between them, making this a more satisfying YA romance than most.The world-building was also wonderful. If you enjoyed this aspect from The Star-Touched Queen, then you\u2019ll be even more thrilled with the level of detail here, as it is another step up from the author\u2019s debut efforts. I loved Alaka, and the aura of myth and mystery that surrounded it. In fact, at times it felt like an information overload, simply because the strange and magical descriptions would keep coming and coming. The deluge got to be a little too much at times, but overall I appreciated the introduction to this rich and beautiful setting.When all is said and done, A Crown of Wishes delivered everything I hoped for in a follow-up to one of the top YA novels I read last year, and I highly recommend both books in The Star-Touched Queen sequence. I\u2019ll definitely be keeping an eye out for the author\u2019s future projects.Audiobook Comments: Narrator Priya Ayyar did a fantastic job on the audiobook production of The Star-Touched Queen, which was I was so happy to see her reprise the role for the sequel. Her strong performance was one of the reasons why I decided to continue with this format for A Crown of Wishes, and I was not disappointed. Her reading was even better this time around, and once again she did great with the inflections and accents. I would not hesitate to recommend this series in audio."}, {"userName": "Elena May", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57120721-elena-may", "userReview": "\u201cA story is control.\u201d\n\nWhat a gorgeous novel.A charming, colorful, atmospheric fantasy book, based on Hindu epics. We are thrown into a beautiful, magical world of lush gardens and sweet fruits, spirits and demons, yakshas, rakshas, vanaras...And my favorite snake-demons, nagas:The world-building is exquisite, blending so many creatures and legends into one coherent whole. I have just one tiny tiny nitpick. It\u2019s so insignificant that it\u2019s not even worth mentioning, but it\u2019s a part of a larger trend in fantasy and has become a pet peeve of mine. Every once in a while, I read a book set up in a fantasy universe, and I come across terms referring to actual places in our world that break my immersion. It could be a French braid, or Carrara marble, or anything. In this case, it was a Damask rose...Unless, by some coincidence, there is also a city called Damascus in this fictional world, and, coincidentally, it was also involved in the history of cultivation of this particular rose, the name doesn\u2019t make sense. Would it even refer to the same rose, cultivated as a hybrid of two or three other kinds for the high quality of its oil? Yeah, if I\u2019m nitpicking about this, you can imagine the rest of the book is very close to perfection!The book is full of magic and reads a bit like an ancient epic, with the heroes accomplishing tasks and discovering bits and pieces of this wondrous world. The characters are well developed and grow over the course of the tale. Gauri and Vikram are perfect foils to each other, she \u2013 pragmatic and somewhat paranoid, and he \u2013 trusting, hopeful, and a bit naive. In the end, he must learn doubt, and she must learn hope...The book teaches us the importance of stories and how essential it is to listen and to share. Each story has many facets, and seeing only one is dangerous. I think the true beauty of the book is how everything comes together at the end \u2013 the origin of vishakanyas, the Serpent King\u2019s story mirroring Gauri\u2019s, the power of storytelling.While I loved The Star-Touched Queen, I still thought it had some problems. But none of them pop up here. I was delighted to see the author has grown so much between the two books. And while I was happy to see a few references to the previous book, I\u2019m also glad they were kept at a minimum \u2013 this was Gauri\u2019s story, and she had to accomplish her goals without Maya\u2019s help, which is exactly what happens.A beautiful read."}, {"userName": "Jiana", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10502567-jiana", "userReview": "2.5I literally cannot tell you what went on in this book except for like the first 15% of it?? lmao anyway, this book sucked.

They were whacked out of the story before they had any time to really surface.As for the characters? I can't even be bothered to remember their names. They gave bleh a whole new meaning. They felt short on every aspect the author tried to depict. The girl was made to be this fiery character, a valiant, resourceful, cunning princess.
