I just finished Bubbles by Abby Cooper & it was a delightful middle grade/YA! Sophie is struggling with the fact that she thinks she not only broke up her mom and her boyfriend but also caused her mom to lose her job. While it's pretty normal for kids to think things that aren't their fault are, she then has to deal with the fact that she starts to see thoughts bubbles above people's heads! I loved this take on kids learning to read other's thoughts based on body language & tone. I also loved how the author surrounded the main character with helpful adults including a motherly neighbor, teacher and therapist!

I was able to learn about Abby Cooper and her first novel called Sticks and Stones. I actually got to meet her at #NerdCampMI last July. We ran into each other again at one of her Barnes and Noble book signings. I picked her novel Sticks and Stones to read to my fourth graders. When we were done, she visited my class and answered all of our questions.On top of all this, she left my class with her upcoming novel Bubbles, that will be released next July 2017. This will be our next read aloud in my classroom. I couldn't wait to read it so I brought it home this weekend and read the whole book. When you read a first novel by an author and it is good, like Sticks & Stones, you can worry that the sophomore book might not measure up. That was NOT the case with this book. I loved it. Everything about it was so awesome. The new character of Sophie was endearing and warmed my heart. The plot was amazing with lots of energy and spirit. The supporting characters added greatly to Sophie's story. I actually could not put the book down once I started.I know my fourth graders are going to love it just as much as me. Thank you Abby Cooper for allowing us to experience this newest story of yours. We are honored. Once we finish, it will continue its journey and tour!!!"}, {"userName": "Brooks Benjamin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13086075-brooks-benjamin", "userReview": "I'm always intrigued by how an author follows up a debut, especially if I completely fall in love with it. Sometimes I'm worried that the second just won't hold up. Other times I'm blown away by how they pulled off another story with as much charm and heart.Abby Cooper's BUBBLES holds all the humor and every bit of the magic of her first book, all with a brand new character and concept that is equally original and fresh. Sophie's voice is just as wonderful, and her journey to figure out why she's seeing these bubbles, what's going to happen to her mother, and how she's going to pull of this seemingly impossible school project is so entertaining and thought provoking.BUBBLES will spark discussions of being open, being willing to communicate, and understanding that change can be a truly bittersweet concept.

In Bubbles, as in her debut \"Sticks and Stones\", Cooper infuses threads of magic into her storyline - magic that brings very real topics such as anxiety, depression and having a single parent into a format that tweens can easily read about and relate to. Sophie, like so many other 12-year-olds, often agonizes over problems and attempts to deal with them without ever actually talking about them with anyone - this leads her to misunderstand situations and cope with them in less than ideal ways....and those pesky BUBBLES over the heads of people showing their deepest thoughts don't help! Throughout the course of the book, she learns the hard lesson that talking about problems may not always solve the problem, but it will clear things up and make you feel a lot better. The triathlon storyline is a unique and welcome one in the world of middle grade, and the Chicago setting is as well. Sophie's world of family and friends is a diverse one, with no part of the story being a lesson about diversity - this is incredibly appreciated as kidlit tries to provide windows and mirrors for all readers, but doing so in an non-preachy way isn't always achieved in other works. How do I know tweens like these books? My 11 YO daughter has read Sticks and Stones at least 4 times, and after reading an advance copy of Bubbles, gave it a glowing 5 starts. My middle school students won't let Sticks and Stones stay on the shelf for even a day, and I know Bubbles will fly off the shelves as well once school starts again in the fall. Thanks so much to the publisher for an advance reader edition of this book for review purposes!

I had the pleasure to get an ARC of her most recent novel Bubbles. Bubbles is the story of Sophie who is trying to navigate middle school, with friendships, a sad mom, and a possible crush. But Sophie has started to see bubbles above people\u2019s heads, letting her in on their inner thoughts. This causes a lot of confusion and problems for her. Although the possibility of seeing thinking bubbles above people\u2019s heads is not reality, this book feels like it could be realistic fiction. The plot and storylines are easy to see happening in real life. I love how Abby captures what education is like now. In the book the teacher assigns the student\u2019s a project where they have to take a risk, do something they are scared of or don\u2019t normally do. Without any spoilers, Abby uses this storyline to help inspire the characters, which in turn inspired me to take a risk similar to Sophie\u2019s the next day! I know readers of this book will look to Sophie for the encouragement to try something new! Great job again Abby!

I have a feeling that's what Sophie Mulvaney has done to me. This irrepressible twelve-year-old has had her home life shaken, with her mom depressed in an aftermath of her breakup with Pratik, a boyfriend that Sophie cherished as much as Mom. Worse: Sophie feels responsible for both the break-up and Mom losing her job. And then the strangest thing happens. Sophie starts seeing people's thoughts -- beginning with Pratik's -- displayed in bubbles over their head. What does it all mean? Is she going crazy? (She now has an appointment with a therapist, after all.) And moreover, what's she supposed to do with this new knowledge?In a totally accessible and enthusiastic first-person voice, Cooper sucks readers right into Sophie's world and her predicament. I loved getting to know Sophie's friends -- the anxious Kaya and the goofy Rafael, and even her frenemy Viv -- and following her navigate the treacherous waters of middle school. The runner in me (though, ha, never a tri-athlete, mark my words!) particularly enjoyed seeing Sophie and her friends test themselves by training for a triathlon.

It did not disappoint. A recent job loss and breakup has left Sophie Mulvaney's mom really depressed, and Sophie is on a mission to fix things, particularly since she thinks she's the cause of her mom's woes. To make matters worse-and a whole lot stranger-Sophie starts seeing bubbles above people's heads that reveal their personal thoughts. The road to cheering up her mom isn't smooth--Sophie's training for a triathlon is challenging, she wrestles with jealousy, and a mistake she makes threatens a grade for her and her friends. Despite Sophie's challenges, she discovers the strength of her friendships, the value of supportive adults, and how there's a lot more to a person than their thought bubbles.Bubbles is a delightful read with a good message and strong but flawed female characters.

I was a big fan of her first book, STICKS & STONES, because of the vivid voice and awesome positive message, and BUBBLES has those same two winning elements. 12-year-old Sophie Mulvaney has begun to see bubbles above people's heads - you know, the kind you see in cartoons. These bubbles share their thoughts. Pretty cool right? Actually no - it's super stressful and Sophie is having trouble dealing with it.

I was amazed, chapter by chapter, just how good Cooper\u2019s new middle grade novel truly is. BUBBLES has all the humor, magical whimsy, and lovable characters that were notable in her first outing, but manages to exceed expectations in terms of style, voice, and concept. 12-year-old Sophie has a lot on her plate: her mother is single (again), unemployed and depressed, her teacher is making her do a challenging project on risk-taking, her best friends convince her to do a triathlon with them, and she\u2019s getting a crush on her childhood friend Rafael. To make matters more interesting, Sophie starts to see other people\u2019s thoughts in balloons over their heads and finds out there are definite pluses and minuses to knowing what on people\u2019s minds.The concept works really well and draws the reader deeper into Sophie\u2019s inner world with every revelation. Most of us can relate to thinking we can read other people\u2019s minds at times, and it\u2019s never more important than when in our young teens. The plot moves along nicely and gathers momentum with every relational complication. In the end, it comes down to learning about communication, and without saying too much more, the results are surprising, funny, and touching.

There's a lot of plot I could get into (which is all well paced) but what I wanted to focus this review on are the tough topics that this book handles head on. There are the typical middle school worries about friendships and crushes, and those are done superbly. But, in addition, this book really touches on depression, both at the adult and child level. And it talks about therapy as well, which I thought was amazing. SPOILER PART:.....Take this exchange between Sophie and her mother, about her mom's depression, which is a big theme throughout the book. This is toward the end of the book:\"You were so sad. You've been so sad all the time!\" (Sophie)\"I know. The truth is, Soph, sometimes I get really sad like this. It's something I've been dealing with for a lot of my life. I usually don't let you see it, but this time, I don't know...I just didn't have the energy to call someone.\"And then further on, when Sophie talks to Kaya, her friend who also sees a therapist (also at the end of the book):\"Isn't it weird that we're the only people in school who have seen them, but we never talk about it?\"I nodded. \"I was embarrassed at first. It felt like an embarrassing thing.\"\"Yeah, I get that. But it shouldn't be. I liked going to mine. Did you like yours?\"\"A lot.\"We sat quietly, looking up at all the people walking by. Maybe we were the only kids in our school who had gone to therapists, but I had a feeling that wasn't even close to being a fact.\"Any book that can help normalize going to therapy for kids is one that gets thumbs up in my book.

She is well loved in the middle grade sphere for her first book Sticks & Stones (which after reading Bubbles I now want to read). I wasn't sure what I was going to get with Bubbles, but what is presented is a very sweet story of friendship with a pinch of magical realism. This is a book entirely looking at perceptions of others. Sophie, our heroine, can see thought bubbles over people's heads and she is instantly given an impression of the people that surround her. It's a pretty interesting concept for a middle grade novel, also given that this is a story about risk-taking and essentially trying to be the best version of yourself. There's some wonderful messages in this book that I feel will appeal to middle grade readers, as well as adults who love middle grade.My favourite aspects of this book were Sophie's relationships. She is constantly given reasons to pre-judge people with her 'bubbles' ability, and it's interesting to see her mind fight with the images that she sees. Sometimes she finds herself agree with what the bubbles show, and other times you see that she struggles to see the best in everyone. I think Abby Cooper does a good job of showing this balance, which I think can be hard to do given the novel concept of seeing thought bubbles.Bubbles is a very genuine novel. It's one of those stories where the author does a fantastic job of tapping into the insecurities and impressions that young children can often have as they are growing up. I definitely want to check out Cooper's first novel, but Bubbles definitely left me thinking long after I had closed the book."}, {"userName": "Cindy Mitchell *Kiss the Book*", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19521241-cindy-mitchell-kiss-the-book", "userReview": "Cooper, Abby Bubbles, 262pgs. Farrar Straus Giroux (Macmillan), 2017. $17. Sophie has a mind that never stops and when things get complicated in her life, she starts to see thought clouds (like in comics) about the heads of people around her. In her home life, her mom has gone through a breakup and has become closed off and sad, making Sophie feel the same way, even her friends have noticed. At school they are given the assignment to do something that is a risk for them, so in an effort to get back to her old adventurous self Sophie (and her friends) decide to run a triathlon. But everything just gets more confusing and Sophie must find a way back to herself. Honestly I liked this book a lot, but it was just so chaotic. Being in the brain of Sophie is just exhausting, like ADD, jumping from one thought to the next. While it creates a very unique and well fleshed out character, I think some readers will relate to her and others will just feel confused and give up. I like that it features quite a few true to life themes, like single parenthood, parent/child relationships, depression, change, friendship, and perseverance. The \u2018magical\u2019 (or mental health issue) component of the bubbles is very much off in the sidelines as the day to day thought chaos of Sophie proceeds. I think this nonchalantness about the bubbles will disappoint many readers hoping she had gained a magical power, along with the fact that she doesn\u2019t ever try to take advantage of it. 5-6 graders will be your choice audience.EL -OPTIONAL.

Not only is her mother moping over the loss of her job as a television reporter and her break-up with Pratik, who lives nearby, but Sophie feels responsible for both problems. Thank goodness she has her two best friends, Kaya and Rafael. But once the three youngsters become immersed in plans to participate in a triathlon as part of a school risk project, Sophie starts to realize that Kaya and Rafael just might like each other as more than friends. Things are further complicated by the fact that Sophie has suddenly developed the ability to see others' thought bubbles, many of which show their own fears and inadequacies, and her growing suspicions that classmate Viv Carlson is trying to steal away Sophie's two friends. Although the premise of the thought bubbles might be outlandish, the author nails the feelings of inadequacy that sweep through Sophie even while she watches her mother become increasingly distant and disengaged. Middle graders will enjoy watching Sophie draw from her inner reserves to get back on track and embrace life while serving as an example to others. The author has bravely also tackled a topic that is not often explored in books for middle graders--how the adults in their lives cope with depression. This title provides inspiration to others facing similar struggles while also opening up possible conversations about the topics it addresses, just as the author's earlier title, Sticks & Stones did.

She's the main reason her mom lost her job, and she caused the argument that made her mom break up with her boyfriend. Now, her mom doesn't want to do anything but mope anymore. To make matters worse, now Sophie has started seeing bubbles over people's heads that tell her what they're thinking.

If they win, everything will go according to plan, and her life will be back on track to perfection.I'm really kind of torn about this book. There were some elements of it that were kind of interesting, but overall, it wasn't as good as I was expecting (or had hoped to expect.)I think the main problem was that there didn't seem to be a whole lot of consistency with the story. First, she's trying to help her mom, then she's dealing with magical bubbles, then it's troubles with her best friend, then she's in therapy, then she's trying to figure out her feelings for a boy in her class... It was kind of like \"poof\" all these problems. But then, at the end of the book (after she accomplished her risk goal), it was \"poof\" everything becomes magically better overnight. I didn't think that it made for a very dynamic storyline.And, really, her ability to know what people were thinking played a very, very minimal part of the story. It probably could have been eliminated entirely without too much rewriting. Unfortunately, that had been the part that I was really looking forward too. What I thought was going to be a funny, interesting adventure about knowing what really goes on in people's minds, turned out to be a (fairly predictable) story about a 12-year-old girl dealing with friendship problems. So saying, there was a good overall message tot he story that was about not being a doormat and making sure not to let other people's actions get you down. There were several other, smaller messages about the importance of friendship and family and the like. It might have been more enjoyable for an eleven or twelve-year-old, but it was pretty predictable and a little boring for an older teen.

The unexplainable is most believable, in my opinion, when the author allows the reader to just accept it as part of the reality they are sharing together, and that is exactly what Abby Cooper does when Sophie begins to see thought bubbles over people's heads, it just happens and Sophie must deal. Sophie tells us the story in all of the glory of a 12 year-old's mind, thinking fast, going of tangents, circling back to the original thought. As a librarian I know for a fact that this is the way conversation goes among kids this age, and it is delightful to listen to in the library, and to read in this story. This story also offers the beauty and sheer giddiness that waking up to new \"growing up\" feelings, those that develop from I'm-friends-with- everyone, to maybe \"like\" liking someone, feel like, offering readers a mirror to look at and understand these feelings in a comforting manner. The nuggets of wiseness Sophie discovers are presented to the reader as gifts, offered up for contemplation without judgement. Cooper is wonderful at giving readers closure, the last chapters offer a solid promise that Sophie, her friends, and mom will be all right, because they have each other."}], "description": "Twelve-year-old Sophie Mulvaney's world has been turned upside down.
