Blessed with good looks Abigail could have any fellow she took a fancy to, including the much older ones as well. However Abigail\u2019s life was destined to be short when her cold body was found lying in a drainage ditch with a scarf wrapped tightly around her pale, thin neck. The detectives soon found the culprit, and Jeanie Long was sent to prison for the dastardly deed, who by all accounts was having a passionate affair with the father of the victim. After 10 years in prison, new evidence came to light that Jeanie was a victim herself and was innocent of the crime. But it was too late now for Jeanie, as she committed suicide in her cell before the witness could verify her story that she had been in London the day the murder took place. With such a muck up of the investigation including sending an innocent to jail, DI Vera Stanhope has been assigned to re-open the murder case and find the real killer. The locals of this small East Yorkshire village will not escape the thorough questioning of Vera as she scrutinizes them closely for anything that may be amiss. Telling Tales, has several strong characters, including the much loved Vera with her stocky build, caterpillar eyebrows, who still hankers for a man in her life, to make this crime thriller an exciting and engaging novel. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Rachel Hall", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28372189-rachel-hall", "userReview": "Ann Cleeves is manna from heaven for nosy readers everywhere and Detective Inspector Vera Stanhope is a pleasure to watch in action as she blusters onto a crime scene with her brusque line in questioning, scruffy attire and curious ability to make herself comfortable, even when she is an unwilling intruder. This second novel is another opportunity to devour Ann Cleeves unique brand of atmospheric crime fiction, marked out by her portrayals of village life against the rugged backdrop of the windswept and rugged Northumbria coastline. Cleeves\u2019 novels never fail to engage, marked out by subtle characterisation and a cunning that sees her extruding hidden passions, historic resentments and simmering frustrations. Overweight and shambolic, DI Vera Stanhope certainly elicits strong reactions with her attempt at a dithering and out of her depth old woman, managing to send a ripple of fear through not only the guilty party but those reticent to be drawn. A particular joy in Telling Tales was that Vera made four big grand entrances within the first one-hundred-pages with her thick legs, shapeless Crimplene clothes, open toed sandals and blotchy skin. Vera is the very anti-thesis of a feminine and well turned out Detective Inspector. However, watch closely and you will see that very should never be underestimated and is as shrewd as they come. She feels her way into the complexities of a situation and perceptively picks up on hostilities and lies. Reading an Ann Cleeves novel feels like a homage to the good old days when crime fiction was populated by distinctive characters and littered with red herrings and blind alleys with the ensuing cracks providing leverage for a skilful detective to decipher the undercurrents. Ten-years-ago when Emma Winter moved to the village of Elvet, East Yorkshire and her early days were filled by her sole friendship, with the vibrant and ethereal beauty of best friend, fifteen-year-old Abigail Mantel. Both misfits in their own way, Emma longed for escape to the Old Chalet and Abigail\u2019s glamorous lifestyle with her widowed and charismatic father, Keith. Within six-months of moving to Elvet, Emma\u2019s life was blighted by the discovery of her friends body, strangled to death. The much younger girlfriend of Keith, Jeanie Long, was sentenced to life imprisonment, unable to offer a corroborated alibi and given her fractious relationship with Abigail and Keith asking her to move out of the home she had spent three-months living at. However, ten years later and turned down for parole, Jeanie Long\u2019s suicide prior to a new witness coming forward sees DI Vera Stanhope casting fresh eyes over an investigation that the neighbouring force of Yorkshire originally presided over. It doesn\u2019t take Vera too long to unsettle villagers and enthuse Elvet with her mischievous energy and get to grips with the very ferocity of human emotions and the lengths that it can drive people to.After the murder, best friend Emma went away to university, only to return and live her life as a married mother in the shadow of her overbearing and devout father, parole officer, Robert, and obliging mother, Mary and a marriage to an older man that lacks spark and has left her curiously disengaged with her surroundings. Emma goes through the motions, smiles at the right places and plays the happy wife, but her dreams about the brooding and intense pottery maker who lives opposite, Dan Greenwood, are given more colour when she realises that he was a young sergeant and sidekick to the original investigator, Detective Inspector Caroline Fletcher. Now a civilian, Dan\u2019s past is shrouded in mystery, but the arrival of Emma\u2019s self-contained and studious brother, Christopher, who tells of his long held devoted love of Abigail makes Emma realise that perhaps she wasn\u2019t quite so close to her friend as she believed at the time. As Vera mobilises Jeanie\u2019s father, a man who thought his own daughter guilty, and treats him with humanity and respect, she scours and scrutinises the Elvet grapevine for both scurrilous rumour and truth. If it has substance, Vera eeks it out, from attitudes to Keith Mantel, regarded as lacking scruples in business and known for a string of glamorous young girlfriends, to his importance as a local fundraiser. And what of Emma\u2019s husband, the genial pilot James Bennett and why is Keith Mantel so keen to send Vera chasing after him? Vera is genuine and astute, lacking in airs and graces and is often intrusive and tactless, but she also represents a brand of detective that the reader can identify with. The more readers learn of Vera is seems that behind her indomitable front, she too, has her own disappointments and grasp on human emotions. DI Stanhope may be confident and very proud but crucially she also recognises her own fallibility, and berates herself for missing the obvious (although it is never quite so obvious to her readers as to Vera). Despite looking on DS Joe Ashworth as an honorary son, she is not blind to his sentimentality and how easily he is fed a sob story.Telling Tales is a magnificent novel, marked out by some clever characterisation and the added hindrance that Vera Stanhope and her sergeant, Joe Ashworth, are operating in the neighbouring district of Yorkshire and hence not welcomed with open arms by their colleagues. Given that the second murder is investigated under the authority of the the Yorkshire force and Vera has a tendency to rub people up the wrong way, DS Joe Ashworth comes in handy as a foil to extract information in their tremendous double act. Critically, the denouement and motive behind both incidents was wholly believable and whereas sometimes in the past I have found the rationale behind the crimes that Ann Cleeves creates a little hard to swallow, I was impressed with the wrap up. Simply wonderful."}, {"userName": "Eve", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1283951-eve", "userReview": "\"'I'm Vera Stanhope. Inspector. Northumbria police. A case like this they send an outsider in. Fresh eyes. You know. Check they did everything right the first time round.'\"Cleeves portrays her Inspector as a very unlikable, larger than life character. She reminds me a lot of Columbo...she makes like she's dim, but she's an ocean of life. Telling Tales takes us to Yorkshire, where Vera is brought in to reinvestigate a closed case. Jeanie Long, convicted of the murder of a fifteen-year-old girl ten years earlier, commits suicide on the anniversary of her sentencing just when a witness comes forward to prove her innocence. What really did happen all those years ago? In a town as small as Elvet, everybody's got something to hide...and they don't appreciate Vera's nosy questions. But she's so great at what she does, even when we know that she's as lonely as they come, and probably drinks too much. You have to love her! And I do. I found very few of the characters likeable, and even appreciated how one unreliable narrator was modeled after Emma Bovary (of Madame Bovary notoriety). The last line of the book was so funny in regards to her...like an inside joke! The reveal was also great; five pages until the end and I was still guessing. Can't wait to read the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5240149-brenda", "userReview": "This second book in the Vera Stanhope series was better than the first, but I think there\u2019s still lots of room for improvement. Much of the book is spent getting the reader comfortable with all the players, but I still had to stop every now and then to keep them straight in my head. Michael and Peg Long have a daughter, Jeanie, who lived with a man, Keith Mantel, whose daughter, Abigail, was murdered. Abigail's friend, Emma Bennett, wife of James and mother of Matthew, found the body. Jeanie is convicted, but ten years later, the case is reopened. Emma's parents are Robert and Mary Winter. Robert was Jeanie's probation officer. Their son, and Emma's brother, Christopher, is found murdered. That\u2019s basically it in a nutshell. The interrelationships with these characters sometimes made me want to scream. Emma especially needed straightening out.Vera and her sergeant, Joe Ashworth, come into the picture earlier in this book than the first, which I appreciated, but I would like a clearer vision of just who Vera is. There was more information about her in this book than the first, but I haven\u2019t been \u201cgrabbed\u201d by this character yet. Hopefully there will be more character-building in the third book which I will probably read at some point."}, {"userName": "Noeleen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5333773-noeleen", "userReview": "Telling Tales is the second book in the Vera Stanhope series and I loved this one as much as the first. Vera appears in this book much earlier than the first one. I still didn't guess the murderer in this one either, but had fun trying! The ending really surprised me in this book and although I loved the first book, I think I may have enjoyed this one even slightly better. Another well written, well-paced, engaging addition to the series. I'm starting to feel a little sorry for Vera, she appears to be lonely but doesn't tend to outwardly show this side of her much, when she does, she tends to dismiss it straight away. I want to give her a big hug! Another excellent read, I am loving this series!"}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5779782-ellen", "userReview": "Telling Tales by Ann Cleeves.This was my 1st Vera book and the 2nd in the series although I've been watching the Vera series on TV. Main Characters:Emma and James Bennett-parents of baby Matthew.Robert and Mary Winter-parents of Emma and Christopher.Dan Greenwood-former police office now spending his time in a pottery shed.Keith Mantel-Abigail's father, a shady business man.Joe Ashworth-Vera's right hand police presence on most interviews.Emma Bennett and Abigail Mantel have developed a sort of close friendship or at least Emma would like to think it was close. Abigail was the usual center of attention and Emma was there to be her audience. That was until Emma found Abigail's body in a ditch just outside the back of her home. There was no denying that this was murder. there was no natural cause of Abigail's death. Then who had it in for Abigail and why? Could it have been to get even with her father over some shady business deal gone awry?Enter Vera Stanhope arriving from her usual sleuthing haunt and called in for a fresh pair of eyes on this case. All is not one dimensional in this situation. There are liars and there are reasons for those lies. But which lies hold the key to unlocking this mystery? And then the 2nd body is discovered. Is this a case of a single serial killer and will he strike again? Or is this revenge plain and simple.This book and the TV series are so remarkably in sync it's a delight for the reader. Excellently written and thought out in each detail with the characters playing their parts on the surface and uncovering their darker sides beneath.

I have read several of her Shetland Island series and now have started the Vera Stanhope series. I wish the Vera series was shown on the PBS in my area. She is a layered writer where as each chapter progresses, the reader know more about the characters. A young teenage girl was murdered 10 years ago and someone was imprisoned for the crime. Now it is proven that the girl who went to jail was innocent but it is too late for that girl. Vera is sent to reopen the case and solve the murder from the past.Vera is very tenacious. I do feel as least in this book that she is a lonely person. She knows how her physical being appears to people. I did not know who committed the murders. My mind changed several times and I was still surprised at the end. These are quality reads. If you like fast thrillers, then this series is probably not for you. It unfolds slowly and with detail. I always think while reading Ann Cleeves, that Louise Penny fans would like Ann Cleeves books. She is a very good writer. Her books are character driven and somewhat atmospheric."}, {"userName": "Mary Gilligan-Nolan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5500603-mary-gilligan-nolan", "userReview": "Loving this series with Inspector Vera Stanhope. I had previously read the Shetland Quartet (one further one was added recently) and had hoped this series would be as good, and it is. This is the second of the series, so far, I think there are six published. Ten years after Jeanie Long has been convicted for the murder of 15 year old Abigail Mantel, Jeanie commits suicide after being turned down again for parole. Then, a witness comes forward and gives Jeanie an alibi supporting her claim she was in London on the day of the murder and was innocent. Vera is sent down to Elvet in East Yorkshire, to re-open the case and find out who really killed Abigail Mantel. Vera is a great character, not at all your usual glamorous lady detective, but a very down-to-earth likable character who calls people \"Pet\" and likes a beer or a whiskey, but ends up drinking a lot of tea. A highly recommended series and so far, no need to read them in order."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4380068-bill", "userReview": "Telling Tales is the second Inspector Vera Stanhope mystery by Ann Cleeves. I had read The Crow Trap a couple of years ago and enjoyed very much, then got sidetracked by her Shetland series. Everything I've read by Ann Cleeves so far, I've enjoyed very much.Telling Tales revisits a 10-year old murder after the woman convicted of the crime kills herself in prison and after a new witness comes up clearing her of the murder. Vera Stanhope is assigned to go to the Yorkshire village of Elvet to re-open the investigation. Another murder takes place while Vera is there, begging the question if this murder is related to the previous.The new investigation brings back old bad memories to the community of Elvet, some that they would rather forget. I liked how the story is presented. Vera is an ever-present character, along with her Sgt Ashworth, who assists with the investigation. But the story is also told from other perspectives, those of the town folk proper and this adds a nice touch.All in all, I enjoyed this immensely and I'm glad that I've finally revisited the Vera series.

This book was actually the second in the Vera Stanhope series, since I couldn't get my hands on the first. It was a great book, with Cleeves' characteristic rich description of the setting and deep characterization. I feel as though I know the characters, and I am very much looking forward to getting to know Vera Stanhope better. In this book, a young girl was strangled 10 years ago and this is followed up by a modern related killing. The police botched the investigation 10 years ago, and Vera is set on redressing that problem as she solves the new murder. There's a fair amount of deceit in the tight rural community, and Cleeves kept me guessing about who the murderer was. Now I've got a new Cleeves series to read!"}, {"userName": "Cphe", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14907696-cphe", "userReview": "Bought this because I'm a huge fan of the TV series and love Brenda Blethyn in the title role of Vera. This is certainly a well crafted and solidly delivered police procedural but I didn't quite appreciate the author's \"Vera Stanhope\" if that makes any sense. To my mind she didn't have the warmth, humanity that brings the title character to life on the page.Loved the setting and the well executed mystery component but to my mind it is the bleakness of the environment that is a wonderful backdrop to the main character of Vera Stanhope."}, {"userName": "Louise Fligman", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44322198-louise-fligman", "userReview": "Give it time and you'll soon be hookedIt took me a while to get into this book because it is a slow-burner. It doesn't have tense and thrilling action the whole way through like other crime novels, but I think that is what makes this series stand out. I like how Ann Cleeves not only introduces you to all the main characters, but gives you really deep information about them and their pasts. As I persevered, I became very intrigued, particularly after the first part of the novel. Tension and suspense slowly but surely built to a crescendo and when the killer's identity was revealed, I was stunned. This is what I love about crime novels: the whodunit is so shocking that you cannot help but love it. I love the character of Vera; she is brusk and tells it how it is which often resulted in my smiling to myself.I will definitely be reading the next book in this series and I would recommend this novel and its predecessor, The Crow Trap, to those who enjoy a good crime thriller, but one that slowly builds the tension."}, {"userName": "Carol Jean", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11174893-carol-jean", "userReview": "Fascinating characters and atmosphere.

I started reading it while cooking Thanksgiving dinner and had such a hard time tearing myself away every time I had to stop to tend to some cooking. Vera is her usual insightful, stodgy, and somewhat unnerving self.In this mystery an old case that was thought to be solved is now reopened and Vera is brought in as a new set of eyes. The death of young girl in the past is tied to the death of a young man in the current day. The witnesses and survivors from the original case are brought back together and secrets and lies are brought to light through Vera\u2019s digging. Great writing, wonderful sense of place, intricate plotting of the mystery, and well drawn characters, Vera is one of my favorite detectives.

I did, at one point, think the actual murderer could have been guilty, but it wasn't until towards the every end of the book that I finally worked out she must have done it. I do prefer the Shetland Islands Series (which is one of my favourite all time series) but this is still a very good series that I am enjoying. Vera is a very unique character and the books are so much the better when she is central in the story. I would recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Ruan Peat", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16526265-ruan-peat", "userReview": "So much different to the first and again a great novel, found myself unable to put down the book until I had the killer, again it was someone that had been visible from the start who had been in and out of the frame but never seemingly the center, even as you get to the end you still have to hang on to your seat. For me this is turning into a modern mystery series and I get the same feelings of joy from the twists and turns as I have had from Christie and Sayers, with the addition of a modern setting and views. My only missed note has been the description of Vera, is at odds with the TV version which first brought me to the series, but that I can live with that and to have more yet to read!"}, {"userName": "John Morris", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18940379-john-morris", "userReview": "This is how i like my mystery novels.

I enjoyed the series so much that I had to read the books. This is the second book in the Vera Stanhope series. We don't see Vera in this book until about a third of the way through, but we are introduced to some truly unlikable characters before we do see Vera. I couldn't help thinking, \"Hooray, finally a character that I can enjoy!\" Vera has been called in to reexamine a case that was supposedly solved ten years ago. The person who had been charged with the murder of 15 year old Abigail Mantel had always insisted she was innocent. A witness that had been out of the country had since come home and contacted police to tell them that Jeanie Long's alibi for the time of the crime was verified. In the meantime, Jeanie Long had taken her own life in prison. So that is why Vera is sent to the little village of Elvet to get to the bottom of the whole thing. Naturally, the villagers are not happy to dredge up all the unsavoury details of Abigail's death. Vera finds not much co-operation and assistance in this tight little, closed-off, unfriendly village. She perseveres though and uncovers all kinds of old-history that doesn't shed a very good light on anyone in the village. The killer is unmasked due to Vera's thorough investigating skills. I love Ann Cleeves' characterization. Her characters are so realistic, especially the unlikable ones, and Vera and her sidekick Sergeant Joe Ashworth are treasures in the fictional detective genre."}, {"userName": "Lee", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2278623-lee", "userReview": "2nd in the Vera Stanhope series, and a complete surprise ending.

And she did wait until almost the end to pull the rabbit out of the hat. It sometimes seems like she withholds information just to keep the thing going.That said, this was a good title for the book, in which all of the characters had stories to tell. Some of them were truthful and some not so much. Life's like that.This is the second Vera, only recently published in this country, and she's still developing the characters, appropriately. Joe's still a newbie, but they're working out a good relationship. She's also feeling her way into the plot, but she does work it out in the end.
