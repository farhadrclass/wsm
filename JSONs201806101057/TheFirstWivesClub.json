If your tired of the H whose always seems to get out of a big grovel with a cheeky smile, and a \"I will be faithful to you from now on, mostly, If I am not too tempted the by the buxom blonde in the spandex..\" and some hot smokin' smexxing moves then you need to cleanse your palate with a good ole' fashion make-the jerks-sorry revenge novel. I admit I wear a lot of rose colored googles and tend to throw a lot of pink and purple sparklies around in my quest to really believe in the HEA, but there is a dark, seekrit corner of my heart that just wants to see the dawgs beg for mercy. That is why periodically I just have to read this book.Yes it is vindictive, it is cruel and probably very frightening to most males, (my own husband read three pages and ran away screaming, I think it was the part about the paint job getting ruined on the jag), but nobody actually gets physically castrated they just get a good dose of what is coming to them. Olivia Goldsmith manages to take every kinda alphahole H know to Romancelandia and characterizes them brilliantly in her four male \"bad guys\" in TFWC. She also does a pretty good job of exemplifying the typical doormatty h's seen in too many novels to count and finally gives them a backbone. What I find particularly interesting is that none of the ladies could do it for themselves, they really are \"good girls\" for the most part, but when one of their own kills herself because of her asshat husband, watch out. The ladies find an inner strength and resiliency that would make any proper Romancelandia h stand up and cheer and want to move over to chick lit, all in the name of avenging their fallen comrade. They aren't really very kind or sweet about it either, but they do remain ladylike at all times while slowly turning the screws on four very rotten scoundrels who finally get what is really coming to them. The book is over the top, and yep it has got a lotta fluff, but believe me if you have read as many bad romances as I have, you have got to appreciate the break. In any other romance book the ladies would quietly get on with their lives and wait for the gents to see how they missed them and return. Annie would take Aaron back with a half-hearted apology and a few \"I really love you's\", his indiscretions overlooked and quietly swept under the rug. Our abuser Gil would agree to go to counseling and maybe become a monk to help other's overcome their violent tendencies. Elise and Bill would come off as Hollywood royalty and Bill would promise to be more discreet in the future and Morty would realize that all he really wants is Brenda and a cannoli. OG doesn't take the easy, sweet route. No way, the guys were pigs of the first order and they gotta pay. The ways to make them pay and the methods used are most of the fun of this book.I can't tell you how many times I have smiled in wicked glee as Elise sells Bill's collections for a dollar, I had even more fun contemplating Gil's major financial collapse and subsequent interview with the SEC, almost as much fun as imagining the paint melting off his classic jag. When Morty gets sent to prison I just had to cheer and when Annie -nicely- tells Aaron off, it was the highlight of the book. I know it isn't nice, compassionate or kind, but I was glad those caricatures of male romance hero's suffered. I felt a blow was struck in the name of justice for all the times the h's have to say \"It is okay dear, all is forgiven and I still love you\" and then ride off into an unbelievable HEA. I know the ladies got an HEA in this one, they made sure of it themselves. All in all the novel is not the greatest piece of literature in the twentieth century. Parts are trite, some characters are obviously over-dramatized, but so what? Every one needs a break from the overwhelming forgiveness with no real reparation so prevalent in Romancelandia today and I am so glad Ms. Goldsmith managed to do it in a wickedly funny entertaining style that still makes me laugh every time I read it."}, {"userName": "K.", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5663034-k", "userReview": "Trigger warnings: Donald Trump. Also suicide and racism and misogyny, all of which go hand in hand with that first one...I tried really hard to love this one, because I know that my dear friend Wendy loves it. Buuuuuuut reading this in 2017 is a lot like reading a 470 page book about Donald Trump. Because seriously. Every single one of the male characters in this book is basically Donald Trump. Donald Trump is name dropped multiple times. All the male characters basically aspire to be Donald Trump. There's a crapton of Trump-esque racism in the story.

I must have had this book since the early 90's and never read it. But I recently watched the movie again and found this copy in my bookcase. Lucky me.Well if you've seen the movie, try really hard to grab a copy of the book. The story is so much more complex, the characters are so deep and interesting and the men are so much eviler than they had been portrayed in the movie.It was funny in spots but I found this book to be way more complex and what these men had done to their wives and the world around them was something else. The wives might be men-haters in most of the book, but along with this being chick lit, it has romance and each one of our jilted women find love somewhere along the line. Shallow they are not. Obsessed yes, but shallow no. There was a lot of insider trading going on in the book, not so with the movie. It really brought back to me the late 80's and the 90's and not in a good way!Here is one difference -in the movie Annie's daughter turns out to be a lesbian -not so in the book. In the book, she has Down's Syndrome, but someone else turns out to be a lesbian. We learn a lot more about Cynthia and her husband Gil is sort of the focus of all the wrongdoing going on in this book. And Morty isn't the gruff but sweet man he was in the movie.This was a totally fun and engrossing read for a book of this particular genre and this age."}, {"userName": "Isabella Banner", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7411394-isabella-banner", "userReview": "I thought this book was well...unfortunate. I was interested in reading the books because I had seen the movie first and loved it! But I was very disappointed in the books. I thought the transitions from character to character were a bit rough, the plot was ALL over the place, the characters were either overly developed to the point that we were still learning things about them up until the very last chapter of the series or they were underdeveloped to the point that made me wonder why the author gave them a point of view in the story at all. In my opinion there was WAY TOO MUCH exposition! Every chapter was a new meaningless character that the author described for what seemed like endless paragraphs or a description of a setting that was unimportant to the story. And don't even get me started on the transitions between time and setting. Why would anyone write a scene and then in the next paragraph make it suddenly nine weeks later in the story? Another thing I didn't like was the sex. I am 15 years old and I just couldn't take all the useless sex. It added nothing to the plot and very little to character development. The contradictory statements in the books also bothered me. Overall the book was mediocre and could have been improved, but tells a good tale of three women overcoming circumstances that they were forced into by their low life husbands and even getting revenge on them along the way."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Moran", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6176855-stephanie-moran", "userReview": "I decided to read this book because it has a movie connection and I wanted to watch the movie again as I didn't really remember it... This has to be one of the most annoying books I have ever read! I wish kept a tally of how many times I rolled my eyes or said aloud, \"I hate this book.\"This book is about a bunch of self-absorbed divorcees that come together after a friend of theirs, whom it seems they pretty much ignored or shunned, commits suicide. The seek revenge on their snobby husbands, who seem to have left them for no other reason than for younger women (or in Annie Paradise's case, because she couldn't have an orgasm - which I find as an outrageous reason to leave someone).The concept of this book was a great one, but the way it was written is straight up disgusting. The stereotypes throughout this book are sickening. I don't think I will ever forget, until my dying day, that Brenda Cushman was fat. How could I forget when every two pages, if she wasn't present, someone was talking about how fat she is, and if she was there was some type of reference that she was fat. Always eating cupcakes and sweets, but only a size 18. My guess is if she was a middle aged woman overeating that she would be closer to like 300 or 400 pounds. But just a guess. Then, she falls in love with a woman, but of course the author makes the woman seem manly - so only fat women and those with manly features can be in love?? WTH!The conversations that the characters had were often predictable or shallow. The sex scenes were odd and often the offers to have sex were very strange. Also, I couldn't for the life of me, figure out why these women were constantly showing up to social events that all their ex-husbands were also at. And then with dates and people they were using to screw them over. The last annoying thing, was all the name and product dropping. No, I am not accustomed to high society, but way to make me not relate by calling out all the designer name items they wore/used. The $4,000 dresses. I GET IT - THEY'RE RICH! SOOO glad I am done with this book and I am going to permanently remove this trash from my bookshelf as I will never read it again nor suggest any of my friends to read it."}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16557864-jonathan", "userReview": "A sublimely satisfying read! If you've only seen the film, you owe it to yourself to read the book! While the film was a terrific screwball comedy, the book goes so much deeper. Not only are there belly laughs-a-plenty, but Goldsmith's novel has its touching moments, its scathing moments, its moments of satisfying and poetic justice!The book is a completely different experience than the film. If you enjoyed the film - or even if you didn't - pick up the novel and give it a try. I will avoid spoilers, but will say the story of Annie's daughter is one of the most touching I've recently read. Unlike in the film, her daughter is not a lesbian but a young woman with Downs Syndrome finding new independence. Her mother's struggle to let go is told with delicacy and honesty.The husbands' crimes are 10 times worse than in the film...and the wives' revenge is 100 times sweeter! These women aren't playing around this time!As I enter the second half of my life, I find that The First Wives Club has given me much to think about. It's not merely a tale of revenge...it's a tale of growing up and discovering who you really are.Olivia Goldsmith has quite a knack of putting right into the places she sets her scenes. I'm a 37-year-old man who grew up in Midwestern suburbia (and not exactly the intended demographic for this novel) but I had no trouble feeling transported into the world of the backstabbing social elite. Some of the situations and dropped-names (Leona Helmsley for one) might date the book, but Goldsmith's prose is so rich that I felt as if I had been there.I knocked off a single star for what I felt was the only shortcoming in a wonderful read. There are so many supporting characters in the novel that I occasionally wasn't sure who I was reading about, especially as many chapter may have passed since the last time they were mentioned. Full disclosure, however, I read this during slow times at work so there were a lot of starts and stops, your mileage may vary considerably.I can see myself revisiting the Wives and their quest for justice again one day.

I came into it having watched the movie, which was very light hearted. The first half of the book was quite a bit deeper than I expected. There were moments of beauty and heartache and despair. Annie's story resonated with me more than any of the other women, which surprised me. Her emotions felt the most real to me. Her husband was the most despicable out of all of them (even the megalomanic/woman beater). Annie's husband only left her but refused to acknowledge their daughter with Down's Syndrome. AND he only really liked his first born son. The middle son was always neglected because he saw how special his sister is. OH. And he gambled away his daughter's trust fund on the stock market. That was the money that was supposed to sustain her lifestyle at a special school. Annie had to sell everything she owned in order to make sure her daughter would have a happy, healthy, and normal life at Sylvan Glades. Despite all that, I think it was Annie's loneliness really resonated with me. I've been that lonely before so I could relate to her on a very deep emotional level. Annie's character is so much deeper than the Diana Keaton portrayal of her in the movie.Right around the 50% mark in the book, Olivia Goldsmith changed her writing style. The chapters shifted from these detailed character moments that were really introspective to these choppy chapters that jumped around. You know what I'm talking about when I say choppy chapters -- the kind of chapters that jump POV's and are separated by a few line spaces and a ***. I might not have had a problem with this if she hadn't just decided to start doing it in the middle of the novel. To be honest, I didn't care what the minor society characters were thinking/talking about. I was invested in and cared about the main characters. To have moments without them showed me that Goldsmith lost her way a little bit toward the end. It seems like she felt compelled to include ALL THE THINGS rather than the most important. My little gripes here are what kept me from giving this a four star review.However, I found The First Wives Club by Olivia Goldsmith to be the precursor to what we think of as chick lit. I read a review on Goodreads that called the book \"the grandmother of chick lit.\" I think that's an apt description. This was published before Carrie Bradshaw and Bridget Jones hit the scene. I can't say that Goldsmith intended on creating a new genre that's marketed to women but I think she and the book are probably as close as we can get to that moment where authors and publishers realized that female readers were their most powerful demographic.All in all, the book was DEFINITELY better than the movie and quite an enjoyable read. If you've ever been scorned and/or lonely, you'll be able to identify with Elise, Brenda, and Annie."}, {"userName": "Roberta", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4547374-roberta", "userReview": "Cosa succede quando un gruppo di amiche si rende conto di essere state usate, scartate e gettate dai loro ex mariti? Nella vita normale, le donne in questione si sfogherebbero parlandosi, mangiando e uscendo insieme. Nel mondo di Olivia Goldsmith le cose sono un po\u2019 diverse.Tutto inizia con il suicidio di Cinzia, che prima di togliersi la vita spedisce una lettera alla sua cara amica Annie, che per\u00f2 non ha visto per lungo tempo. In questa lettera, Cinzia racconta i continui soprusi subiti in silenzio dal marito, che alla fine l\u2019ha lasciata per una donna pi\u00f9 giovane e bella. Al suo funerale, il suo ex marito non si degna neppure di pronunciare l'elogio funebre e di accompagnare la bara al cimitero.Annie, a sua volta divorziata e amica di Brenda, divorziata anche lei, ed Elise, ex diva del cinema con un matrimonio in crisi, realizza che questo \u00e8 il destino che aspetta tutte loro. E\u2019 proprio Elise a un certo punto a capire che la vendetta \u00e8 un buon surrogato della felicit\u00e0, e che causare la rovina economica e familiare dei loro ex mariti sar\u00e0 solo una soddisfazione. Pian piano per\u00f2 l\u2019intento distruttivo viene accompagnato dalla volont\u00e0 di ricrearsi una vita di tutte queste donne e dei vari personaggi che le circondano.

I personaggi non sono di particolare spessore (rispondono pi\u00f9 che altro ad esigenze di trama) ma risultano comunque simpatici od antipatici. E' divertente inoltre la tendenza della scrittrice ad intrecciare continue relazioni tra i vari personaggi che finiscono con il \"cozzare\" continuamente fra di loro quasi New York fosse un quartierino di provincia.Nonostante le tematiche proposte siano di grande interesse (violenze familiari, la relazione dei genitori con i figli portatori di handicap, le relazioni di donne con uomini pi\u00f9 giovani, relazioni interrazziali, relazioni omosessuali, la droga) il trattamento delle stesse e la risoluzione dei problemi \u00e8 pi\u00f9 legata alla volont\u00e0 di costruire una trama avvincente e divertente che a produrre un'effettiva critica di quel brillante mondo del jet set che, a quanto pare, brilla assai poco. Gli stessi problemi affrontati dai vari personaggi, esposti in maniera un po' superficiale ed ambientati in un contesto in cui tutti sono ricchissimi e amorali, difficilmente riescono ad indurre nel lettore una considerevole dose di empatia."}, {"userName": "Lisa (Harmonybites)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites", "userReview": "If you've seen the film based on this, well, this is quite different in a lot of the details, and is much raunchier, darker, crueler, meaner and more vindictive. It's a breezy fast easy read despite its thick length, but although light in that sense, I'd hardly call it fluffy. The novel follows three women: Elise Eliot Atchison, Annie MacDuggan Paradise and Brenda Morrelli Cushman are seemingly very different people. Elise, born to a WASPy rich, high society family, was a glamorous movie star in the Grace Kelly mold. Annie was the good Catholic \"Mainline girl\" who is thin, practical and proper. Brenda is a fat brassy, funny half-Sicilian and half-Jewish. But what all three have in common is that all of them are \"first wives\" dumped in middle age for young trophy wives and betrayed in various ways by their husbands. Elise is drinking too much, Brenda is eating too much, and Annie is trying to cope with crushing loneliness after sending off her teenaged Down's syndrome daughter to a residential home. Then Annie's receives a letter from an old friend, Cynthia, who just committed suicide--a letter that details the various betrayals of Cynthia's husband who had also discarded her for a younger woman. After Annie shares the letter with the others, they form \"the First Wives Club\" and vow revenge on Cynthia's ex-husbands and their own former spouses. No one would mistake this book for great literature--I found particularly irritating the hard-to-read attempts at depicting a heavy Spanish accent with spellings like \"dey,\" \"ees,\" \"chou,\" and \"asseestant\" and the tendency to overuse \"Well\" to begin sentences. At times what's set in motion by the three seems too vindictive. With the husbands, it's more justice than revenge, but the scheme targets the new spouses too, and in all but one case, the second wives seem to me more the next victim of the ex than evil women who should be taken down. But I nevertheless found this rather trashy book a very entertaining read and I enjoyed watching the developing friendship among the women and their personal growth after their divorces. Set in late 1980s New York City, the novel is a bit like a caper story for chicks with all the satisfaction of seeing an elaborate revenge scheme come together."}, {"userName": "Eletta0925 Fouche", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2413259-eletta0925-fouche", "userReview": "Nothing like the movie, which was more of a woman's empowerment theme.

It had some ironic bits and some humor - kind of like life. But it was harsh and hard in places, too - again, like life. The cover also says something about 'couldn't put it down'. That's something I can agree with. As long as this book is, I inhaled it. Don't start it if you have other things to do in your life. Take a weekend, stock up on snacks, and read until your eyes give out."}, {"userName": "Jordon Hensley", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17598498-jordon-hensley", "userReview": "As much as I love the movie, this book is really transcendent. Annie, Brenda, and Elise jump off the page as feminist icons. There is something so much more female about the characters in the book verses the characters in the movie. You really feel they are out to help themselves rather than just act as a response to the men (although that's obviously a part of it.) All three women end up finding something in themselves that they didn't have before and it just made my heart and soul soar. Definitely a must read."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1849282-lisa", "userReview": "I read this book before the movie came out. I think if I had seen the movie first, I would have never read the book. The movie was horrible! This book is way more interesting. The characters had much more emotion & substance. Don't get me wrong... this is not going to be a literary classic, but in the book you get to see them much more vindictive, angry, sad, and hurt; and the revenge that they achieve is much more fun (and cruel) than the movie allowed you to see. Again... if you're looking for something fun, a little steamy, and even a little mean, then check it out."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/791437-mary", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters were engaging and showed considerable growth throughout. Caution--if you have seen the movie, the book is very different. They emphasized the comedic aspects of the book and softened the characters considerably. While the book does have some comedy in it, it was much darker than anything in the movie. Loved the revenge aspect--it was totally appropriate."}, {"userName": "Kricket", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/125201-kricket", "userReview": "this is the perfect book to read by the pool when you are in florida with your lady friends.also i like revenge stories."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10929708-nicole", "userReview": "This book was an interesting read with a new take on revenge. I laughed and felt myself get angry at times. The book is very different from the movie, with only the basic idea and main character traits remaining the same. I enjoyed the book, but it had slow periods of unnecessary details. This is not a book I can see myself reading again. Once was enough."}, {"userName": "kriszeth sthemphick", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2520557-kriszeth-sthemphick", "userReview": "i confess that what made me take up this book was the feeling i loved the movie when i was like 12, i think, though i didn't remember the plot at all anymore.i loved how these women grew and bloomed over adversity and despair to become strong and independent and realized, and how you can always begin again, and reach a better place."}, {"userName": "Heather Sabian", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13486918-heather-sabian", "userReview": "I loved this book. It was dark, funny and nothing like the fluffy movie that was inspired by it. Three very different women brought together by by being left by their husbands. These women are strong despite appearances. my favorite this about the story was each women was allowed to be herself and in the end all of her apparent weakness were actually strengths."}, {"userName": "Lisa James", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4867814-lisa-james", "userReview": "Stellar! I'd seen the movie & laughed my ass off, because it was indeed funny as hell, & with the cast in it, how could it NOT be? However, the book was SO much better! In turns I was sad, as well as laughed out loud! It's a light read, a great \"summer read\", & you cannot help but admire these ladies, especially if you are a woman of a certain age, like I am!"}], "description": "Don't get mad.
