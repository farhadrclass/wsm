Her early works are stylish burps of weirdness about the burned children of Canvey Island. From the masterpiece Wide Open to the perverse Reversed Forecast, these short novels gave voice to a band of coastal misfits, charming in their antisocial lunacy. Lately, her novels have been concerned with formal innovation and taking huge experimental risks, as witnessed in Behindlings and Darkmans.Burley Cross Postbox Theft lunges in an unexpected direction: the realm of straight comedy. Shunning character-driven, interpersonal dramas, here Barker performs an act of tantric soliloquy, putting a whole range of complainers and oddballs in the spotlight.The contents of a postbox in the fictional town of Burley (Burnley\u2019s malaprop twin?) are stolen. It falls upon one PC Roger Topping to solve the crime. In a hilarious rambling monologue, Barker begins to channel the spirit of Monty Python and doesn\u2019t relent for the remaining 300 pages. To hear John Cleese read the opening chapter would be bliss.We are invited to read from the stolen letters, which range from the believably absurd, (a tirade about dog poo), the surreal (forbidden seduction techniques), the self-referential (correspondence to a local novelist), to the touching (declarations between two lovers).Despite this tongue-in-cheek Variety Show performance, it is clear these letters are a new loom on which Barker can weave her intricate patchwork of small-town life. Although the range of voices on display is impressive, and the content more playful and comedic than her other works, there are scenarios in BCPT that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in Behindlings or her more emotion-driven works. The letters are laced with hidden darkness, hidden intrigue, hidden sadness, while the comedy dances upfront and amuses the Queen.As a comedy, though, it begins on a Cleesian high note and keeps the laughs flowing at an impressive rate. Even in the lesser moments, the novel coasts by on its charm, linguistic sparkle and imaginative wowness. Although the resolution is something of a letdown, it is a pleasure to read this formidable novelist kicking back and writing a novel that showcases her talents for voice, comedy, and good old-fashioned entertainment.Take a bow, Nicola. ::curtain closes::::Nicola runs screaming from Prince Charles::"}, {"userName": "Vicki", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2227373-vicki", "userReview": "At first glance, it seems Nicola Barker has left behind the dark, menacing, labyrinthine world of Darkmans for sunnier, simpler climes - a quaint, pleasant village, the setting of Burley Cross Postbox Theft. Then again, whether you know this author by reputation or by past experience with her singular collection of works, do you really think she would pen a straightforward, conventionally charming epistolary novel along the lines of, say, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society?Any such misapprehensions are quickly set aside as the first letter detailing the village's recent postbox (mailbox) theft case is teed up ... and devastatingly tees off on its recipient. That first letter is ostensibly a directive from a police sergeant to a police constable, instructing the constable to take over the investigation of the theft and recovery of a box of mail shortly before Christmas. That missive rapidly takes on strange intensity and personal viciousness, seemingly for nothing more than perverse reasons, as Sergeant Everill taunts Constable Topping on besting him in everything from job promotions to romance. Everill's odd, manic outbursts carry with them more than a shade of the troubled Dory from Darkmans, a character who was possibly clinically schizoprenic. Before the reader can figure out what to make of it, the book rolls on into the seemingly random collection of letters that make up the recovered postbox plunder.There are three types of epistolary novels (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistola... monologic (giving the letters of only one character), dialogic (giving the letters of two characters), and polylogic (with three or more letter-writing characters). In addition, a crucial element in polylogic epistolary novels (such as Dangerous Liaisons) is the dramatic device of 'discrepant awareness', wherein the simultaneous but separate correspondences of the heroines and the villains create dramatic tension. Burley Cross Postbox Theft is an arresting amalgam of all three, capturing connections made and missed. Many of the diverted letters are comic monologues about life's petty annoyances, ballooned into hyperbolic diatribes. Other monologues capture loneliness, longing and yearning. The inventory of the ill-fated Auction of Promises is a unique monologue of good intentions going horribly awry. The book as a whole is a cacophonous polylogue, seemingly random at first but falling together in interesting, startling and often heartrending fashion as each letter is opened. The interjections of an opinionated translator form a kind of dialogue with her interpretation of one letter for which the need for translation is not entirely clear. Finally, the collection of letters is framed by a dialogue of sorts between assigning sergeant and investigating constable, where PC Topping renders both the final word as well as a singularly soul-redeeming monologue.Throughout, Barker populates this written - sometimes scribbled, sometimes meticulously typed and tapped out - chorus with characters who run the sympathetic gamut, from quirky, forlorn and wistful to bewildering, manic and kinda scary, to the edge of irredeemable. And this is just as Barker would have it for the readers willing to hang in with her often dense, often thorny, always rewarding stories: 'There are writers who exist to confirm people's feelings about themselves and to make them feel comforted or not alone. That's the opposite to what I do. I'm presenting people with unacceptable or hostile characters, and my desire is to make them understood.' (http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/...)Not only does she make her disparate tangle of souls understood by the end, but Barker sews it up elegantly, organically and in a way that is both uplifting and just a touch satisfyingly vindictive. It's delicious.In this day and age - and Burley Cross Postbox Theft is firmly set in the present - why should anyone care of some random bits of paper get lost in the increasingly dismissed and antiquated post? Barker addresses that in fine fashion, too, as part of PC Topping's summing up of the postbox theft mystery:\"Let's see ... I know that pubs are on their way out (hundreds are closing every week), that they're merely a sad reminder of things past (the way we once were, The Good Old Days), just like 'community spirit' is, and communities themselves, and churches, and local bobbies, and pickled walnuts, and brass bands at fetes, and tall hedgerows, and handwritten letters, and home-cooked meals, and sparrows, and boredom, and books, and gob-stoppers, and ladybirds, and innocence ... Yes. All for the high jump. All for the chop. All nearly eclipsed, now (may they rest in peace), by a much bigger, brighter future, in twenty-four-hour digital HD.\"But just as PC Topping didn't buckle under Sergeant Everill's verbal assault when passed the postbox theft assignment, so his seeming rueful lament for a world quickly passing by is actually no lament at all, but a gentle yet pointed reprimand. Just as he plausibly disentangles the postbox theft and sorts out who needs to see which of the misdirected missives, his self-effacing tidying up at the end seems to more profoundly echo E.M. Forster's beloved call to \"only connect.\""}, {"userName": "Ben Carroll", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4873389-ben-carroll", "userReview": "After the massive, incomprehensible, hilarious and bruising Darkmans, Nicola Barker decided to write an almost linear, almost straightforward novel. Then she found herself disappearing down 27 separate fantastic and obtuse tangents within that relatively straightforward, arced novel. Then she went nuts, got rid of the original novel, and just kept the tangents.I have no evidence for any of that, of course, but that's the story I back-engineered from Burley Cross Postbox Theft. It is, if anything, more marvellously scattered than Darkmans; Barker plays on the esoteric, and makes the lack of connections as much a braggable feature of the novel as the rare/barely there connections.The conceit of BCPT is that a bag of letters, stolen from the rusting postbox, is found abandoned by the criminal in a back alley. It's these letters, along with bookending missives from the two police officers trying to solve the crime, that make up the book. It's the perfect plan for Barker, who gets to flex her fearsome muscles in constructing wild and vibrant voices. Within the 27 letters, there is enough room to roam far, far away; and enough constriction to keep the book from ballooning into a four-inch spine.The lack of exceptional length is really important. Because not only does Barker roam/tangent/scatter/explode more than ever before, but she also ties the whole thing together. That she even tried for an 'ending' completely surprised me -- I was fully expecting a non-ending to match the non-narrative before it. But end it she did, surpassing anything I originally expected from this book.I demanded the impossible after reading Darkmans in January. I wanted Barker -- or anyone, really -- to make virtuoso explosivity of prose the heart of a novel, to completely disprove the need for an actual ending by being so spectacular -- and then to give me the ending to match the spectacular body. And here it is, the impossible, Burley Cross Postbox Theft.Now I want the sort of rare steak that makes me irresistable to women, and leaves next weeks lottery numbers written in blood on the plate."}, {"userName": "J.M.

She's a phenomenal writer who doesn't seem to get her due here in the States. I can't recommend her enough. She is difficult, hilarious, surprising, and probably one of our greatest living novelists. BCPT revives awesomely the epistolary novel, the novel in letters, seemingly doomed in the digital age of ether-fucklets and imaginary no-nothing correspondence. A postbox gets ripped off and a cop sifts through the evidence which is the text of the novel, the bunch of letters inside, to try and see who did it.It's one of those novels that makes you snort out loud with laughter, has tons of shit jokes, and which, right at the very end, makes you feel like Satan is picking you up, turning you around, and when it sets you down it is God instead doing the deed."}, {"userName": "Kirstie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/700282-kirstie", "userReview": "This is a high 3/5 stars but that's really all I can say. Barker is witty and exceptional at writing and all of her novels have something special about them but I really expected more from this one. It's about a Postbox Theft where all that is left are a series of letters from the small English town of Burley Cross but really it's about the inner workings of a town between the destitute and the desperately romantic, the homeoerotic secret lover spots and the miserly old spinsters...what is interesting is the vastly different takes on the characters of the town from different perspectives. It really makes you wonder what the truth really is about each human being that supposedly exists and resides there and makes you realize how different your point of view on someone may be from someone else and how differently people may think of you. This could very easily de-evolve soap opera style if it weren't for Barker's wit and talented prose. Still, it doesn't seem profound or life changing in any way.

The Big Police Force can't get a handle on it, so the case is turned over to a more local officer in hopes of him getting to the bottom of it. The only evidence, as such, is the stack of letters that was stolen--that is the book.Read carefully. As in small towns everywhere, everyone knows everyone else's business and talks about it endlessly, even in the mail. Each letter-writer has a specific voice and style as well as a specific ax to grind. Some of them are wonderful, kind-hearted (if delusional) people. Some are despicable in every way. I loved the \"translation\" letter (one of the letters was written in patois), and the one from the frazzled mom of several whose life is a total and complete disaster.

Let me list the pros and cons of this book.PROS-\tIt\u2019s written all in letters. I like that. Brings me back to some of the books I read in high school.-\tYou can get a good perspective of the village of Burley Cross through all those letters.-\tThere are some truly funny moments, such as the \u2018sex hex\u2019.-\tIt\u2019s original.-\tThe ending is truly innovative.CONS-\tAll written in letters means sometimes not a lot of background detail is there.-\tSometimes some characters don\u2019t really seem to fit in all that well into the overall narrative (such as the church play, who was the person writing the letter and what was their role?)-\tPeople don\u2019t really write letters that much nowadays due to email etc. and they don\u2019t always go into extreme detail. (A fairly trivial point though).-\tThe neighbourly arguments can sometimes be a little too close to reality. (Not applicable if you live in Summer Bay or Neighbours).-\tIt gets a little boring in places, trying to work out where all these people fit!There you go. After writing the list, I\u2019ve tempted to lean towards the \u2018I like\u2019 list, but you probably won\u2019t feel comfortable reading a book about village life (disputes, love, friendship, planning disputes etc.) if you\u2019re having a neighbour war of your own. On the other hand, it is a witty look at petty politics and worth a laugh, particularly if you\u2019ve ever had any voyeuristic thought about a post box. The characters are over the top (I still shudder thinking of Baxter and his appearance post-sex hex) and cleverly illustrated to display their flaws. There are loving moments and some just plain ridiculous moments (such as the phantom dog dropping bags tied to fences). Like real life, there are some moments that just seem not to do anything or be part of the bigger picture. In retrospect, I found that nice \u2013 too often now TV programmes and some books lack any deviation from the Major Plot Line.This book is an eccentric departure from the linear plot and should be enjoyed as such. You\u2019ll either like it (as I ended up doing after I penned my thoughts) or think it\u2019s a load of junk mail."}, {"userName": "Lisa Ahlstedt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2016568-lisa-ahlstedt", "userReview": "When I first read about the Burley Cross Postbox Theft, it sounded like a book for me. A postbox is vandalized and the letters found discarded in a yard in a sleepy English village. The police must investigate to figure out what happened and who is responsible. Because quite a large number of letters have been left behind, the police must attempt to determine what is missing and why. For some reason, the police investigators decide that they must read all of the recovered letters.Unfortunately, the entire book consists of letters, both from the police and the residents. This wouldn't be a problem, except that there are SO MANY of them, and most of the writers have an annoying tendency to ramble, put in lots of unnecessary asides (one even has footnotes) and otherwise lead the reader far, far from the story. There are so many letters that it's basically impossible to keep all the people in the story straight, without some sort of diagram or chart of the village and who lives where. Once the mystery of the burgled postbox is finally revealed, of course it transpires that the vast majority of letters had nothing to do with the theft, but rather, I suppose, were an effort to demonstrate the intense rivalries, jealousies and gossip that takes place in a small town. I would have liked more story and fewer characters to keep track of. Some of the letters were amusing, but still, there were simply too many of them! The events in the story take place around Christmas time in 2006, but even so, I would think that people had somewhat slowed down in the posting of letters by that time."}, {"userName": "Barb Otter", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29132126-barb-otter", "userReview": "Letters stolen from a village postbox are found and read.Poignant and funny, I particular liked the letter regarding the Auction benefit, very amusing ."}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2928626-jess", "userReview": "[ This review was originally posted on my blog: http://turnherintoliterature.tumblr.com/ ]After wanting to read this for ages, I finally caved in and bought it from Book Depository (there is no way I would have been able to find this in an Australian bookstore).And, sadly, I then wished I hadn\u2019t bothered to listen to the hype.

In this particular book, the people were SO unlikeable, petty and narrowminded through their (frankly too longwinded, though that was the point with some characters) letters.

It chugs along at a decent pace, I laughed a lot, and there were some genuinely sweet, dramatic and affecting moments amidst all the provincial satire (along with a fair helping of Alan Partridge, actually).But also: everybody writes in basically the same voice - usually I'm not one to notice if characters' dialogue all just \"sounds like the author\", but it's far more obvious when there's 40+ letters supposedly written by different people, for different people, but they all use the same style and tone - and it's difficult to get away from the fact that, well, whilst I can buy that some small-town folk are self-obsessed to ramble on for dozens of pages at a time in a letter, they're less likely to include dialogue and tell their story in a pleasingly familiar narrative structure..."}, {"userName": "Derek Baldwin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2200252-derek-baldwin", "userReview": "Extremely entertaining pastiche of epistolary novels which is like a blend of Adrian Mole, Mapp & Lucia, the maddest soap opera ever, Diary Of A Nobody, ooh plenty of stuff all mixed up and stirred vigorously.

But for two West Yorkshire policemen - contemplating a cache of 26 undelivered missives, retrieved from a back alley behind the hairdresser's in Skipton - it's also a job of work. The quaint moorside village of Burley Cross has been plunged into turmoil by the theft of the contents of its postbox, and when PC Roger Topping takes over the case, which his higher-ranking schoolmate Sergeant Laurence Everill has so far failed to crack, his expectations of success are not high.Yet Topping's investigation into the curtain-twitching lives of Jeremy Baverstock, Baxter Thorndyke, the Jonty Weiss-Quinns, Mrs Tirza Parry (widow), and a splendid array of other weird and wonderful characters, will not only uncover the dark underbelly of his scenic beat, but also the fundamental strengths of his own character.The denizens of Burley Cross inhabit a world where everyone\u2019s secrets are worn on their sleeves, pettiness becomes epic, little is writ large. From complaints about dog shit to passive-aggressive fanmail, from biblical amateur dramatics to an Auction of Promises that goes staggeringly, horribly wrong, Nicola Barker\u2019s epistolary novel is a work of immense comic range. It is also unlike anything she has written before. Brazenly mischievous and irresistibly readable, Burley Cross Postbox Theft is a Cranford for today, albeit with a decent dose of Tamiflu, some dodgy sex-therapy and a whiff of cheap-smelling vodka.", "title": "Burley Cross Postbox Theft\n      \n          (Digital Trilogy #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7421414-burley-cross-postbox-theft", "average": 3.27, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327970018l/7421414.jpg", "reviews": 41, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7374.Nicola_Barker", "name": "Nicola Barker"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Humor", "Mystery", "European Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7421414-burley-cross-postbox-theft", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9338086-burley-cross-postbox-theft", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10466606-burley-cross-postbox-theft", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30759789-on-a-vol-la-bo-te-aux-lettres-de-burley-cross", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1139452.Darkmans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/779580.Wide_Open", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13395627-the-yips", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/590634.Clear", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1459556.Five_Miles_From_Outer_Hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
