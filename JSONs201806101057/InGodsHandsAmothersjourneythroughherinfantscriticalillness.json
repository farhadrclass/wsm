Elissa D. Bjeletich shares her experience as her daughter is diagnosed with liver disease. I was encouraged by her faith and attitude throughout the book. Don't be afraid to read this (especially if you tend to shy away from sad stories)--this isn't a sad story. It is real and there are both disappointments and triumphs. She writes, \"It isn't easy to adapt to your child's decline\u2026but it is certainly easier to adapt peacefully than to allow anger and depression to overtake your heart.\" I highly recommend this book for yourself or as a gift for anyone you love. This book is delightful! It will leave you smiling!"}, {"userName": "Elissa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10417714-elissa", "userReview": "I like this book so much! :)"}, {"userName": "Mimi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4474787-mimi", "userReview": "I \"know\" the author from Facebook and have heard bits and pieces of the story of her daughter's liver transplant.

I was so moved by this courageous mom's journey through such a terrifying time with her critically ill baby. While the medical journey is itself quite the tale, it was the author's steadfast Orthodox faith that I was so struck by and inspired by in so many ways. I think that any Orthodox Christian would be deeply moved by this book and will find much within the pages. Any reader, whether Orthodox or not, would find this a compelling tale of one parent's journey through an unspeakable time with faith and love. Highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Jane G Meyer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/107337-jane-g-meyer", "userReview": "Following the journey of the author as she supported and cheered and sacrificed her own plans, her own needs to tend to and support her failing newborn. The story is about moving from sickness to health, aided by the many miracles both prayer and modern medicine can bring... Though I've never endured this sort of struggle in my own life, I feel like I've walked this road by way of the book, and have new tools of endurance from the author's example to help aid me if I ever end up in a similar place.
