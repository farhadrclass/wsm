Ideally, all teachers want students to walk into class already knowing how to make meaning from the text, revisit it a number of times to deepen their understanding, make metaphorical and reflective connections, and to venture from the text to other texts. But, sadly, this is hardly ever the case. We, as teachers, are the ones responsible for teaching this set of skills that will enable to become frequent and better readers as adults.  When reading this book, I found it important to make sure students see why they are learning the things they are learning. Providing a background and a point of reference for students to use is vital in teaching students deeper reading/learning. When Gallagher used his example of his teacher and the students\u2019 writing, it helped the students see the connection between their lives and the text. It is important for students to make a connection so they can see the relevance in what they are learning. Gallagher once again provides many different and insightful ways to get students to approach texts. He gives us many great exercises to help further students\u2019 understanding, generate focus, achieve deeper comprehension, and establish metaphorical connections. I will gladly say that I plan on using some of his exercise ideas in my own classroom. More importantly, I can see many ways to create new exercises from the examples he has provided.  Gallagher once again makes this text easily approachable because of his style of writing. He has an easy-going, anecdotal way of explaining himself.  Like his other book, Readicide, I would recommend this book to future, current, and former teachers. It ties in well with Readicide. This book was extremely helpful and inspirational. One last thing this book taught me - By knowing what you want to achieve at the end of your lesson, you can come up with interesting and creative ways to effectively get there."}, {"userName": "Laura Leaney", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3633494-laura-leaney", "userReview": "I hovered between a rating of 3 and 4 stars on this. The book has value for English teachers, but like many books chock full of \"activities\" to elicit deeper meaning from text, it's a little dry, especially on the back end. I like Gallagher's sensibility though. I would trust him as a reader, because he knows that \"reading is not an all-or-nothing proposition. There are gray areas.\" I wish someone would tell the people at Common Core. I also agree with his stance that \"learning begins when we encounter confusion.\" What happens, especially for young students in the school system, is that they feel like they ought to know what the text \"means\" right away. (Picture here a kid with his or her head dropped on a desk, shoulders hunched in despair). It would be very helpful if young people could \"welcome and embrace confusion.\" I agree. When I read Kant or Kierkegaard I encounter confusion every five minutes. Additionally, I admired his advice on: re-reading, using metaphor to deepen understanding, and providing a sense of purpose. More information on reading the internet, art, and history would be helpful. Minor quibbles. If you teach high school, as I do, and you find yourself with some dependent readers in your classroom, this book will be of significant benefit."}, {"userName": "Dawn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/286002-dawn", "userReview": "Typically, I am wary of books written from a high school teachers' POV because I feel so much will not be applicable to my very different elementary school universe.

I, like many other teachers, view Gallagher as a teacher rock star, and Deeper Reading does not disappoint. What I like about Gallagher is that he knows what works for teachers because he is a teacher. While his methods are clearly deeply rooted in theory and research, Gallagher presents these methods in a conversational tone, and his books read like a really good teacher-friend giving you practical advice about what works well and what makes learning fun.\tOverall, Deeper Reading focuses on reading as a process. He emphasizes that our first-draft reading, much like our first draft of writing, only scratches the surface of meaning and understanding. The book is focuses on six components of deeper reading: focusing the reader, effective first-draft reading, deepening comprehension through second-draft reading, the importance of collaboration, using metaphor to deepen comprehension, and leading students to meaningful reflection. What\u2019s great about Gallagher is that rather than focusing on why each component is important, he provides the reader with a variety of strategies to help engage students in each part of the reading process. For example, in the section \u201cFocusing the Reader\u201d, one of the strategies I can\u2019t wait to try is the daily focus question (p. 46). Rather than giving students a \u201cgotcha!\u201d reading check quiz that really only tests their first draft of reading (which they probably did while watching Jersey Shore, or something of equal intellectual merit), you provide students with a guiding question that either deals with a major theme from said reading or helps to guide students into one of the major ideas students will be focusing on in their closer reading of the text. Gallagher even cites Sheridan Blau\u2019s three key questions (What does it say? What does it mean? Why does it matter?) (p. 86) and expands on various ways to get students to tackle these questions on their own.\tGallagher is quickly becoming my 2nd choice go-to-guy for ways to shake things up in my classroom. (My first love is Jim Burke, and first loves die hard.)

Deeper Reading explores how teachers can get kids to not just fake read or highjack others who have done the work.

Although I do not remember my freshman English teacher, I dearly loved both my sophomore and junior year teacher as well as my senior English teacher, primarily because what I love about them is that they used techniques such as the ones advocated by Gallagher in their own lessons.

I acknowledge that may be too high a standard for a pedagogical text, but there it is. This book is highly practical, so it's valuable in that it offers a large number of activities that can be applied to different types of texts, and while his examples often target high school students (or adults), they illustrate how the ideas might be adapted for younger students.One slight drawback is that some of the references are outdated (newspaper activities would almost certainly be online and not pulled from paper copies; technology use has evolved), but that's true for most books that offer specific instructional ideas that relate to technology in any way.The section with fiction activities seemed to contrast with the ideas I've read elsewhere about prioritizing reading and discussion time, rather than doing vocabulary activities and charts and so forth. He offers examples with whole-class (or small-group) novels, too, which is different from work with independent reading selections. I appreciate his caution about not relying on any one activity or strategy with students to avoid making it stale, and he is certainly not an advocate for worksheet machinery or graphic organizer overkill. I also appreciate the idea that teachers need to dig in and provide support for readers, instead of just sending them off on a reading journey and wishing them bon voyage, and these activities offer concrete ideas about how to do that. However, every time they are completing a chart - even an open-ended one - students are spending less time actually reading. The assignments can be great springboards for peer discussions and they can help focus students on particular literary devices; it's just a balancing act (as always) to ensure students have time for independent reading and have time for explicit instruction. My favorite sections were about the importance of metaphorical thinking and the ideas for supporting students in their thinking about \"real-world\" texts, which could include \"reading\" a commercial, a piece of art, an editorial, a statistic, or a political cartoon. While many of the strategies for fiction were familiar to me, this section sparked lots of new ideas that could be applied in different subject areas. His point that we want students to be able to read both what is said and unsaid in texts they encounter as adults is well-taken.The metaphorical thinking section encouraged me to take more time with themes and big picture thinking skills for all my students. Even though some of my fifth grade students aren't as prepared to process metaphors as high school students might be, this book reminded me how worthwhile it is to dig in to the complexity of a text for all sorts of readers. I think there are many more things I can do with my students to get them to think more deeply about things they read, and this offered some excellent starting points."}, {"userName": "Claudia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70211-claudia", "userReview": "Kelly Gallagher is one of a handful of professional writers I'll drop everything to read. I did...\"Readicide\", I think, is one of the most important books an English teacher could read. He gives us so many powerful, practical ideas here that support his views about avoiding over-teaching and under-teaching literature.Gallagher thinks in metaphors, writes in metaphors, and teaches with metaphors. He has packed this book with great ideas, not all of them new, but great ideas to facilitate student learning.I love the idea of the first draft reading and second draft reading. He recognizes the importance of reading all kinds of texts, and his lesson for teaching Pieter Brueghel's \"The Fall of Icarus\" makes me want to be in his class.Gallagher distills his teaching and planning down into four questions: 1. Without my assistance, what will my students take from this reading, 2. With my assistance what do I want my students to take from this reading. 3. What can I do to bridge the gap between what my students would learn on their own and what I want them to learn. and 4. How will I know when my students get it. Those questions and his strategies of focusing the reader, first draft reading, second draft reading, collaboration, metaphorical responses and reflective response...A template like that could take us through all our literature teaching.As I said, many of his suggested activities are not new -- I've 'invented' some of them, other teachers I've worked with have 'invented' them. Gallagher put them into a framework -- his four questions. He knows when and why he uses each strategy.Since my job is different now with my elective, it's harder to incorporate some of the activities, but the mindset, the attitude, the love for students and for their literacy growth?

Because of the disjointed way I read it, I think I was able to let a lot more sink in than if I read it straight through, as I have other Gallagher (and teacher/writer) books. Inbetween activities and pages, I had opportunities to meet with teachers, share the ideas included, try them out myself, and see the results. In that way, I have a much better feel for the usefulness and value of the philosophy Gallagher lays out here and the reason his methods will actually lead students to stronger understandings and connections to their reading.I especially liked the way Gallagher's activities and examples get at the ways that reading (specifically literature) does not always fit a comfortable, easy graphic organizer. To illustrate his belief, the dominoes, multi-layered time line, and seen/unseen activities are so much more flexible and honest than other forms of note-taking/GO that I've used with students.

I learned that as an undergrad and was required to demonstrate it in lesson plans during student teaching in every lesson. The strategies that he presents, for the most part, are \"old hat\" to me. Gallagher talks about groups, effectively breaking students up and how to keep them engaged. Well, Mr. Gallagher needs a Kagan's cooperative learning workshop. I learned that in 1990 when I started teaching. This information is hardly revolutionary. However, elementary teachers and special education teachers are strategists by profession, whereas high school teachers are more content experts. Gallagher also talks about when he has created assessments in the past he would think of what his students learned and what they may have \"overlooked\". Rather than assessing what he taught! I find this appalling! Why would you put something on an assessment that you hadn't taught? He calls this \"fuzzy\" teaching. How does he NOT know what he taught? Does he not have unit plans?

Between the two books (Readicide and Deeper Reading), issues of literacy have taken on an urgent tone. Literature may be able to effect profound change, but it's ultimately impotent if individuals are not able to read deeply, or read at all, for that matter. Gallagher's strategies, and the emphasis he places on the importance of including all types of text (Internet, advertisements, political cartoons, newpapers, SPAM, etc.), reinforce the idea that teachers need to prepare students to be informed citizens. I especially liked his idea of having a Newspaper Month, and a unit on advertising, and I think these two ideas would marry well with a novel such as 1984.
