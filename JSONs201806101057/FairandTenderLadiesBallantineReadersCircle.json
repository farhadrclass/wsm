This is my life.\"In the words of Ivy Rowe, one of the most spirited, wisest, and most memorable literary characters EVER, I am \u2018ruint\u2019 after reading this incredible novel! Seriously, I cannot get this book out of my head and out of my heart. It seems everything else will pale in comparison for quite some time. I had never heard of this book or the very talented author, Lee Smith, until now. I have surely been remiss, but it is never too late to make up for lost time. I\u2019m sure Ivy would agree.Make no mistake about this book \u2013 it\u2019s not light and fluffy, not sappy, and not just another mundane book about the toils of a backwoods woman and her brood of children. What is this about then? Well, it\u2019s so many things\u2026 it\u2019s about the hopes and dreams of a young girl, love for family, courage, standing up for what you believe in, facing the consequences of your choices, middle age, great sorrow and abundant joy, love for the land, the passion for reading and writing, and about growing old with dignity. I\u2019m sure as readers we\u2019ve seen all of these topics tackled before. But never have I seen all of these things wrapped up in one package and expressed through a voice with such honesty, passion, and immediacy, with no excuses made nor any appeals for our sympathy or pity. \"I have made my bed and I wish everybody would let me lie in it.\"We follow the life of Ivy Rowe from adolescence to old age through a series of letters written to various persons \u2013 a childhood pen pal, siblings, parents, friends, teachers, and children. The letters are so intimate, however, that they are often more like a diary entry, sharing with us the deepest and truest thoughts of a very candid correspondent. Ivy Rowe was born up on Blue Star Mountain in Appalachia. Much of her writing is in the regional dialect, but this did not for one minute throw me off or confuse me. In fact, it added to the authenticity, as if I were reading real letters recovered from a young woman\u2019s hope chest. As Ivy ages, likewise her writing matures. She dreams of becoming an author someday, and her letters are a testament to the fact that even if she never publishes a novel, she truly is a gifted writer. She shares with us her joy for life, memories of old stories, and her desire to travel and become educated. \"I thought of sliding on the frozen river in the snow, and of the lady sisters skimming home across the snow after they had told their stories, I thought of the story of Whitebear Whittington, and then I thought of all the stories I dont know yet, of books and books full of stories in Boston. I immagined their lether bindings and their deep rich covers and the pretty swirling paper inside the covers, like the snow.\"Ivy makes such astute observations on life; she makes mistakes \u2013 sometimes very big ones, and she forgives herself. I have often thought and said that forgiveness is a gift. Well, I do believe that is true. Ivy has taught me, however, that even more than forgiving another human being, forgiveness of one\u2019s self is perhaps the most difficult yet the most generous of all. As Ivy enters middle age, a stage in life with which I can currently identify, her story becomes even more gripping and meaningful - perhaps because I can relate to those questions she asks herself about her own life and whether she has spent it in the way she had hoped. \"I guess that the seeds of what we will do are in us all along, only sometimes they don\u2019t get no water, they don\u2019t grow. Other times, well \u2013 you see what can happen.\" Oh Ivy, you made me laugh, you made me cry, and you made me think\u2026 and think some more. I want to live my life as you did \u2013 with spunk, with acceptance, with strong affections and last but not least, with peace. I probably don\u2019t need to say it, but this is a clear favorite and I would tell anyone to please read this book! I have to return this little jewel to the library soon, but my very own copy should arrive any day now - along with one more Lee Smith novel I have ordered, likely to be followed by a succession of her work. \"This is important, I want to remember this, it is all so important, this is happening to me.

Sometimes when Ivy was growing up \u2014- [compassionate by nature] \u2014 even with so many people on the mountain \u2014Ivy still felt lonesome. She didn\u2019t feel as though she had anybody she could really talk with. But - she knew when her baby Joli came \u2014 she would talk with her. Ivy wrote letters .... I LOVED THEM ALL.....( she also always loved a story) ....There was one letter where I wanted to stand up and cheer, \u201cHALLELUJAH, AMEN, YOU GO GIRL\u201d: \u201cDear Miss Mabel Maynard,I know you will be interested to hear from me because you acted so mean to me always and then you felt at my stomach the day I left, and ran off crying. You cannot deny you did this, because you did. And since I got up here, I have had some time to think about it, and reflect. So I have something to say to you. Miss Maynard, do not pity me. Do not bother to dislike me, nor pity me, nor anything else, because I do not need anything from you, nor want to either. My Little baby Joli Rowe was born September 10, 1918. She is all mine, I have never had a thing of my own before. She is the most beautiful baby in the world. So, I pity you!\u201d Your former acquaintance, Ivy RoweIvy Rowe..... I loved her spirit! She had a zest for love - for inner understanding- accepting the way that things turn out - not always as we dreamed - seeing reality and people - and herself - the way they/ she really were/was. Ivy was mindful - aware - made mistakes and took responsibility for them - Sometime she was tired of being grateful- could you blame anyone? But mostly Ivy \u2018was\u2019 a grateful human being. She lived her life without regret.....knew when to apologize.....lived through good and bad days. She danced - she mourned - made us laugh and cry. And she taught us that by following our own path \u2014life can be a truly fulfilling existence. This was my first Lee Smith book \u2014- THANK YOU Sara.....and Diane too.....BOTH of your reviews express how I feel about this book deep down myself. I can\u2019t ever remember reading a portrait of life \u2014 spanning 70 years of an Appalachian woman. Or .....of any woman that was so wholeheartedly beautiful.

I paid attention to the way the dialect changed over the years. Wow....I tried to imagine the patience and skill it had to take to write an entire novel like this.

I have been in her heart and in her head for the last few days, and am now emerging with an inspired sense of just how wonderful life can be when you face it with awe and courage.Ivy was not a paragon of virtue by society's standards. She followed her heart and her passions, never doing the sensible thing, though she was as smart as they came. She loved indiscriminately, but not always wisely, and refused to apologize for her decisions. She was religious in her own way, but never \"got saved\" or was much of a church-goer, as she disagreed with a lot of God's plans and actions. She trusted herself to do what was right for her, a thing that can be hard to do in a small mountain community. But as she said, \"once you are ruint, it gives you a lot of freedom\". Born in 1900, we follow Ivy's life through the letters she wrote to friends and family. From a childhood with 8 brothers and siblings, on a farm way up high on Sugar Fork, through youth and marriage and motherhood and old age, we hear her opinions on everything she cares most about. Oh, let me age as Ivy did, always learning, ready to accept new ways, but recognizing the value of the old ways too. \"I said to Maudy, Those birth control pills are great. They are the greatest thing since drip dry. You ought to get yourself some\". Her father used to say, \"Farming is pretty work\". So is writing, when you do it like Lee Smith does, creating a world and populating it with a heroine like Ivy Rowe. My second reading of this book cements her place in literary characters never to be forgotten."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara", "userReview": "This is a fabulous book with an unforgettable heroine named Ivy Rowe. It is great--believe you me! Set out in letters that begin with a twelve year old Ivy and take us through an entire lifetime, Ivy\u2019s soul is put onto paper, sprinkled with all her hopes, dreams and disappointments. I defy anyone to get past the first letter without loving Ivy unreservedly. She surely made me laugh, cry, rejoice and lament, and she made me remember something of a life that I once had a glimpse of that is now gone forever. If you traveled deep into Appalachia, you might find people still living somewhat the same, but I doubt it. There just isn\u2019t anywhere like Blue Star Mountain anymore.I have sometimes thought that my own life has a soundtrack. I can conjure up specific events and people when I hear certain songs. Apparently, Ivy Rowe\u2019s life had a soundtrack as well. I loved all the references to old songs and, after one of my fine GR friends, Tom, posted one of the songs off of Youtube, I felt compelled to seek out every song that was mentioned and listen to them one by one. It was a surreal experience, since they were songs that conjured my own father and his brothers, who loved nothing better than to get together on the porch with fiddle and guitars and fill the night with folk music, hymns and popular songs of their time. Ivy dreams of a bigger life, one filled with purpose and travel and adventure, but she finds hers is destined to be a rather simple life, lived primarily at Sugar Fork and circling around a small community and a limited number of people. But, I think she finds, in the end, that simple lives have purpose too, and perhaps as many or more facets than those lived in exotic places or in fancy homes. Like the creek that leads to Sugar Fork, her life meanders and turns and changes, and it is the memory of all that moving water that matters the most.\"I felt a pain shoot through me, like an arrow in my heart. Oh Joli, you get so various as you get old! I have been so many people. And yet I think the most important thing is Don't Forget. Don't ever forget.\"Lee Smith is an adroit writer, who almost paints her scenes, like airbrushing with words. I had a true sense of the beauty and wildness of Sugar Fork, the rising mountains, the foliage, and the fields of wildflowers. \"But night comes in slow over Bethel Mountain and we watch it come, like it is sneaking in I reckon, stealing across the mountains ridge by ridge, they go blue and purple before your very eyes, and then the mist will rise.\"I could not be happier to have climbed this mountain with Ivy. She is so refreshingly open-minded, so kind, feeling, accepting and imperfect. Like so many of us, she doesn\u2019t always appreciate what she has, she acts rashly, she caves into desires she barely understands, she falls for lines that she knows are not true, but she presses forward, forgives others and often forgives herself. But, through it all, she chooses. She never abdicates the choice to others and the responsibility, credit and the blame, are always hers alone. If, at the end of my life, I could look back and see a life as full of love and meaning as Ivy\u2019s, I think I could be satisfied.I am always indebted to Diane and The Southern Literary Trail for introducing me to the best authors and the finest books. I have discovered Tom Franklin, Howard Bahr, Tim Gautreaux, Michael Farris Smith, and now Lee Smith.

Coincidentally my GR friend Connie had recently posted her review on this book. Years ago I saw a movie called Songcatcher about a woman named Lily who \"ventures into the most isolated areas of the mountains to collect songs and finds herself increasingly enchanted\u2014not only by the rugged purity of the music, but also by the raw courage and endurance of the local people as they carve out meaningful lives against the harshest conditions\u201d (quote from film review). More recently I have enjoyed reading about American Appalachia, past and present, through the writing of author Ron Rash. Fortunately, all this has supplanted the only other image of the area and its people I had originally been exposed to in the movie Deliverance. Probably not for everyone and no doubt my personal tastes played a big part in my enjoyment of this novel, but like Lily I was completely enchanted.

It is simple and it is wise. For it is the story of each of us. These are among my favorite verses of the Bible. Never have I seen it written so beautifully, so perfectly, as in this novel by Lee Smith.Ivy Rowe is a woman whose life will remain indelibly a part of my life as a reader. While each of us lives out the words of Ecclesiastes, each of us must do so in our own way. This is Ivy Rowe's story. Told completely in the letters Ivy wrote through the course of her life, from a budding adolescent to a very old woman.This book is one to cherish, to keep, to love, to return to, no matter how many books we have left unread in the time allotted to us. It is simply that special. Ivy has much to tell us and she does in a manner each of us can see a bit of ourselves, whether man or woman. We laugh with her. We cry with her.As simple as the words of Ecclesiastes are, contained in them is the question just when is it time to do those things in our lives. Often the time to get may be easy. To keep may be as easy. But accepting loss and deciding to cast away what we have held dear is not so easily done.The life of Ivy Rowe teaches the answers to the hard questions.

This story follows the stubborn and very wise Ivy from a young girl at the end of the 18th century to a very old woman in the mid 1900's. Though poor and poorly educated she had a thirst for knowledge and a zest for life. She never lost that ability of the young to look around and see the beauty of your surroundings as well as be grateful for the simplest things in life. Ivy was not simple, far from it but she always kept that sense of awe and wonder. This story is about hardship, about great love, about great loss as well as about great yearning and disappointment. Family mattered, no matter what. Ivy travelled through her life with a dignity and quite a sense of humor that was matched only by how strongly she felt things. She had little fear and charged ahead without considering consequences, then accepted whatever came her way. Having come from a family of strong midwestern pioneers, and having lived in the mountains of rural Tennessee and North Carolina that mimic the setting of this story I appreciated how on target Smith was in her descriptions of the people, the traditions, the lore of this generation. Her descriptions of the settings were lyrical, almost musical and I could close my eyes and see the fields of wildflowers, smell the rain in the air before the storm, hear the birds in the early morning and feel the dew on my bare feet. Having also received a weekly letter from home for the last 35 years of my life (since I left home) I could appreciate Ivy's letters as her way to stay connected to those who held a place in her heart. These letters were full of great sorrows and joys and everything in between. I also appreciated the changes in society that were discussed in these letters, how progress in the world eventually comes to all corners. We learned about not only Ivy's life but that of her family as well through these letters. She was the person who kept them all connected. With Fair and Tender Ladies Smith has cemented herself in my mind as the ultimate writer of Southern story telling. I listened to the audio and so appreciated the language of the mountains. The dialogue held the charm of the rural, mountain folk yet the speech was almost like the old English, no contractions but correct grammar. The spot on narrative took this to a 5 star rating. It has been a while since I have laughed, and cried and embraced a character as I did with Ivey.

The cover may give you the impression that this is fluff. It is not! It is set in the Appalachians of Virginia. It covers the 1900s through to the 70s. Both wars and the Depression. Yet history is not the focus even if it of course plays a role in shaping events. The focus is a family, the family of Ivy Rowe. She has six siblings, aunts and uncles, grandparents, friends and her own five kids. They get married, and they have kids. Each one of these becomes a person you know. Not once was I confused about who was who! Ivy thought she would become a writer, but she never did. Yet she did, in her own way, because what we are reading are her letters to friends and those in her family. Her whole life is told through these letters. I never imagined that such a complete, heartrending and delightful story could possibly be told through only letters! She reveals her innermost thoughts in letters that are not sent, and thus in this way we get the truth. I would never have trusted only letters to friends and family, because don\u2019t we hide stuff from each other?!What is so special about this book is- the writing. Ivy expresses herself simply and honestly and beautifully. Great writing. Beautiful lines and lines to ponder. - the in-depth character portrayals. Each character becomes someone you know well. Each one is a mix of good and bad. Ivy tells all. She thinks, she simply cannot stop thinking. We watch her from early youth to old age. Through these letters we learn of her life and the life of those close to her. At the end when she is old, you don't want her to die. You cannot bear to lose her. Through her you think of your own life. - the accurate and detailed picture drawn of a \"mountain girl's\" life in the South. Gorgeous writing about rural places - mountains and creeks and hollers. You don\u2019t know what a holler is? In the Appalachians this word is used for a valley region between two hills or mountains, often with a creek. Southern expressions and dialect create a feeling of place. The audiobook narration by Kate Forbes was superb. This is one of those cases where listening to the book is better than just reading it. The dialect and sound you hear further enhance the atmosphere. You hear as Ivy ages, scarcely noting that her voice has changed! Never hard to follow and a great choice for those who have little experience with audiobooks. When I close this book I am sad because it is over. I will be grabbing more by this author.

It\u2019s a favorite group that has introduced me to many great authors and stories, so I dived right in. Boy, am I glad I did! This book will certainly have a place in my top ten books ever. Yes, it was that good. Ivy Rowe is a woman born into a dirt-poor family on a farm beside Sugar Fork creek on a mountain in southwest Virginia coal country, an often-cruel circumstance. But Ivy has a zest for life, an unceasing curiosity, a drive for education, an outsized love of nature and a passion for writing. We meet her in 1915 when she is twelve and we get to know about her life through the letters she writes over the years to a handful of family and friends. And what a life! She wants to be a writer and gets oh-so-close to going north to be educated in Boston, but life has other plans for Ivy. Life is not always easy and her drive to live it fully doesn\u2019t always lead her in the best direction, but Ivy is a model for making the best of her choices and what life throws at her. I loved watching the sweep history unfold through Ivy\u2019s letters from 1915 through the early 1970\u2019s. When she tells, for example, a friend about rural electrification coming to the valley below her, we too are amazed at the moment the lights go on, looking like a valley full of fireflies. We feel her heart break at the loss of lives from war, we know the thrill of her first store-bought dress, we marvel along with her getting a radio and listening to baseball, and we too chuckle at women wearing pantsuits. Ivy doesn\u2019t just live life, she sees life and from this seeing comes a deep knowing. As we experience life through Ivy\u2019s eyes, we are able to see and to know as well. When I finished Fair and Tender Ladies, I was \u201cruint\u201d for reading anything else for a few days, to borrow one of Ivy\u2019s oft-use words. A note on the audiobookThis was one of the best I\u2019ve ever listened to. I felt as if I were sitting on the front porch up there on the mountain with Ivy as she told me the story of her life. While I was reading this book, I found myself thinking and talking with a southern accent! After all, if I were sitting up there with her, I must speak that way too.

I felt like I knew Ivy from the first sentence. She truly seemed to come to life on the pages. I came along a few generations after her time, but I felt like she could be one of my grandmothers. She talked the way I probably still talk :-) Education was important to her, and she was very smart, but she never really got a chance. I guess, really, I felt like I could have been reading family history. That says a lot about a novel.Re-read June 28, 2009There's not all that much to add. This is a book that touches my heart and it's hard for me to write about those.Ivy Rowe is this book. She's spunky, she makes mistakes, she loves, she lives, she's stubborn, she's wrong sometimes; in short, she just feels real to me in a way that very few characters do. Oh, I write fairly often about how I love this or that character, but Ivy feels like someone I know. The novel is written in a series of letters that Ivy writes to others. You get inside her head and stay there. You follow Ivy from the time she's about 10 years old on. There's a whole progression of wide-eyed optimism to teenage carelessness and invincibility to repentance to more carelessness to acceptance and reflection. I live a whole other lifetime when I read this book.Lee Smith chose to have Ivy write in our southern Appalachian dialect and she gets it just absolutely perfect. I literally \"hear\" Ivy with my grandmother's voice, and I hear the the preacher Sam Russell Sage as my uncle. Ivy's sister Silvaney doesn't really speak, but she reminds me of my grandmother's sister, Sue. Do you see the connection I make to this book?It might be a little hard to read at first because Ivy's letters are full of childish mistakes and she spells our dialect phonetically, but don't be put off by that. It gets better and I think you'll understand it anyway. But for a story about a woman who makes her share of mistakes, but lives a life worth living, pick this one up. I think you'll enjoy it. And if you happen to be from the southern Appalachians, I think you'll feel the same strong connection I do.

The reader meets Ivy as a child and grows old with her. She's a natural-born writer, so the story is told in epistolary style through the letters Ivy is forever writing to her friends and family. Ivy believes she yearns to see the world, but as her life progresses and she has opportunities to escape the poverty of her Appalachian upbringing, she discovers that the pull of home and family are stronger than that of travel and adventure. Her life is hard; the story could be depressing. Instead, it is inspiring. Ivy is as wonderful a heroine as any you'll find. She's spunky, tragic, comic, observant, and I think \"joie de vivre\" is a great description of this character. This is Lee Smith's finest effort. The colloquialisms scattered throughout the book are charming and true-to-life. If you ever get an opportunity to see the play and hear the bluegrass songs inspired by the book, I advise you to grab it."}, {"userName": "Julie  Durnell", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4566472-julie-durnell", "userReview": "A totally 5-star book! This is an exceptional epic story of Appalachia in the 20th century written entirely as letters to people in Ivy's life. I was so unexpectedly taken with this life story. The vernacular put me off just a bit at first but then I settled in to sit a spell with Ivy and her family and neighbors. It is just an incredible slice of the Virginia Appalachia life back then. It tells it like was but does not wallow in the poverty or anything that offshoots from that. Ivy loved learning and reading and while she doesn't break from her roots she does somewhat rise above it. She made mistakes but learned from those and doesn't look back with too much regret. As she becomes an older woman one becomes aware just how strong she is, facing hardship and raising a family on the mountain. In her words: \"I will not be lonely. Even if it is just me sitting on this porch, I will not be lonely. But I will tell you another fact which is just as true, it hit me yesterday. I can read every book that John O'Hara ever wrote. I can make up my own life now whichever way I want to, it is like I am a girl again, for I am not beholden to a soul. I can act like a crazy old woman if I want to which I do. I can get up in the morning and eat a hotdog, which I did yesterday. I don't know what I might do tomorrow!\"There are very, very few books that I could finish and then start right back in re-reading but this I sure could. Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Tom Mathews", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22063432-tom-mathews", "userReview": "Lee Smith\u2019s Fair and Tender Ladies portrays better than any other book I have ever read, the hopes and joys, and trials and tribulations of a life spent in the hills and hollows of Appalachia. Told in epistolary style using letters written to friends and family of Ivy Rowe, a girl born at the dawn of the 20th century up Sugar Fork on Blue Star Mountain in Western Virginia. Hers is a story rich in the vibrant history of the Scots Irish settlers who carved out a tenuous foothold in the wilderness on the western fringes of a new nation, bringing with them their music, stories, folk traditions and even their love of home-made spirits. Ivy\u2019s story spans four wars and decades of boom and bust as first the loggers and then the coal companies take move in and then pull out once they have taken all they can. It saw the introduction of roads, automobiles, electricity, radios and countless other changes yet it remains a very insular story that tells of childhood, courtships, marriages, births and deaths, all taking place amid the never-ending struggle to make a living in a beautiful but inhospitable land. My thanks to Miss Scarlett (Diane Barnes) and the folks at the  On the Southern Literary Trail group for giving me the opportunity to read and discuss this and many other fine books. I confess that I did not intend to read this book but this stellar review by our fearless moderator, Lawyer, changed my mind. Thanks Mike, I owe you one. In closing, Fair and Tender Ladies receives my highest recommendation. If you are wondering whether or not you should read it, stop wondering and start reading.BTW: Those who enjoy audio recordings of their books will be very pleased with Kay Forbes\u2019 narration although you will miss out on a lot of Ivy\u2019s creative spelling."}, {"userName": "Mmars", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2243098-mmars", "userReview": "Really 4.5 stars. A couple years ago I fell in love with Lee Smith\u2019s Appalachian storytelling in Oral History. I have finally returned to her with \u201cFair and Tender Ladies\u201d. The book is penned by Ivy Rowe in letters to various friends and relatives, beginning with her preteen years during the WWI era. She loves to read but has not yet developed her spelling skills, so the first 70 pages or so took a bit longer to read as I ciphered out her words and many colloquialisms. But from the get go Ivy is one spirited and attractive red-head. She also has a huge heart and an overactive memory. Her family lives isolated on Sugar Mountain and her father is ill and passes away, leaving her mother struggling to manage their farm, and often relying on the kindness of relatives and neighbors to put food on the table. Eventually her mother moves in with a friend in town and Ivy gets a \u201croom\u201d of her own. After her mother passes away when Ivy is 18, she goes to live with one of her older sisters in a mining town. I appreciated that Smith chose to add this mining community in her book. The societal strata and living conditions here post-WWI was informative and interesting. After a mining disaster, Ivy marries and returns to Sugar Mountain for the rest of her life. I really don\u2019t want to say more about the story, because there would spoilers and I\u2019ve probably spoiled enough already. I\u2019m not a big fan of epistolary novels, but I loved this one. I think it\u2019s easy to get bogged down by the mundane or the letters get repetitious, or are terse, or only skim the surface and are unable to give the reader the whole picture. None of that applies here. Ivy writes to many people and shares what she believes would be of interest to them. She gives advice. She tells great stories (Smith\u2019s forte). And, she bares her soul and tells all to Silvaney, her disturbed sister placed in an asylum in the early part of the book. Interestingly, there are no love letters, though she was \u201cruint\u201d at a young age and had flings, but she has a good marriage with a warm, caring husband. I\u2019ve taken a half-star away feeling that the late-life letters were spaced father apart. I would have liked more depth to her aging process. Perhaps this is realistic, though. As people age, it is not at all unusual to become more insular and have fewer close relationships.Highly recommended slice of life in Virginia\u2019s Appalachian mountains covering a large swath of the 20th century"}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl", "userReview": "I borrowed this book from the library of the mountain town where Lee Smith grew up--my first library book in quite a while. There I was, on my first trip to the library, wandering aisles and I ran across sectioned-off areas with Lee Smith's works. But of course. And I finished this book in one sitting. Oh, Ivy Rowe--what a fascinating character. She is raised in the hollers of the mountains by a father who is too sick to work, and a mother who gave up a comfortable life to raise a family. At the onset, her father is dying, her mother is depressed, and her sister is dealing with mental issues. There is a farm that the women and children must run. Ivy wants to go to school but she can't--she must stay home to help on the farm. Luckily, a teacher mentors her and through her fascination with books, she learns to read and write. Hence the letter writing in the book. At first glance, you're caught off track because the book is in letter form, as Ivy is writing to a pen-pal, to a teacher, and later to her sister who is taken off to a mental ward. The book starts with young Ivy and ends with an older Ivy who has by then, exchanged letters with family members as they move through different stages in life, so you learn the story through letter exchanges.It is moving and melancholic. There is a lot of drama as you learn of marriage, divorce, affairs, illness, and a mine tragedy that brings with it a surprising twist midway in the book. Set against the backdrop of a coal-mining town deep in the mountains, the narrative is scenic and at times lyrical. Lee Smith really writes about southwestern Virginia with grace and authenticity. Written in the dialect of the area though, it may be a bit confusing at first, with words like 'once' for example, written as oncet:  I heard them guns popping all threw the hills and then I knowed it was Christmas wich I had clean forgot. All the rest of them was sleeping in the house. ETHEL I hollered, and direckly she come, wearing Daddys dead mommas old coat, she looked so funny I liked to of died. Get the gun I hollered, and whilst she was doing it I layed rigt down in the snow and made angels, I must of made a thousand angels but I never got wet, that snow was as dry as powder. 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11769643-jen", "userReview": "This book is absolutely wonderful. I\u2019m so glad I read it. This is an epistolary novel (meaning the story is told through letters written by a character in the story) which I hadn\u2019t realized until I started reading it. After the first two pages, I was so horrified by the spelling that I thought \"oh heck no, there's no way I can get through this book if the whole thing is like this!\" But then the book was so compelling that I got completely sucked in and the spelling bothered me less and less until I didn't notice it anymore. Telling the story through Ivy\u2019s letters was a smart move \u2013 it made the story so real and vivid and authentic. The story is very intense, about hard times for these folks who live up on the mountain, with none of the conveniences you and I know and love. You learn about their daily struggle, even just to get water from the spring and haul it back to the house, or trying to get to school with no way of getting there. It was a real eye-opener and makes me feel very grateful for the life I have been given. I\u2019ll think back on this book when times are tough, and realize that things aren\u2019t really as bad as they seem, since others have had it so much worse. Brilliantly written and unputdownable. Fabulous book! (Note: I began reading \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d by J.D. Vance right after reading this, and it\u2019s an excellent follow-up! It gives more background and detail on the \u201cwhy\u201d of some of the things mentioned in \u201cFair and Tender Ladies\u201d, and discusses many related topics.

Polly Hollar gave it to me in college with two lines from the book inscribed in the cover: \"Slow down, slow down, this is the taste of spring\" and \"I have walked in my body like a queen.\" It's an epistolary book that appears as a compilation of all the letters written by a poor Appalachian woman named Ivy Rowe throughout her lifetime. Some letters are to herself, a pen pal, or to individuals who will never receive them. Some letters are to other characters. Throughout these letters, you learn how strikingly intelligent and provocative this seemingly common woman's life is. An example of the ordinary made extraordinary.

She's smart, ambitious, and beautiful. She's feisty as all get out and liable to do anything, not to mention she's ruint. Ivy is a Virginia mountain girl through and through. We discover her story and the stories of those she loves and those she doesn't through the letters Ivy writes to family and friends over much of her life.The New York Times called \"Fair and Tender Ladies\" Lee Smith's most fully realized novel to date (1988), and they got that right. Not only is Ivy fully realized, but the people of the Appalachian Mountains and the changes that fell upon them during the 20th century are too. This is an under-read, must-read American classic, in my opinion, and more of Lee Smith's work has risen to the top of my to-read stack because of it. Thank you, Southern Literary Trail members, for introducing me to this novel. I listened to the Audible version, and Kate Forbes' narration was absolutely mesmerizing.

There is not one specific antagonist or event that this novel is centered on, instead it is centered on the heroine, Ivy Rowe, and the events of her life as they unfold through letters she writes to family and friends. The story begins a few years into the 1900's when Ivy is 12 years old writing about her life to a hoped for pen-pal, and continures into the 1970's as Ivy writes to friends and family. Ivy lives in Appalachia and is very bright despite insufficient education. Ivy's life is neither perfect nor tragic. Like any real life, she has her good times and bad and she makes mistakes and must face the consequences. Also, like in a real life, her life does not turn out the way she planned but it still seems to turn out for the best.Bottom Line: If this book were a movie it would be rated PG-13 for some adult themes, there are references to sex throughout, but nothing graphic.

I thought I would really like this because of what I thought it would be about and because it got good reviews overall, which really mystifies me. This novel starts out in the 30s in the Appalachian Mountains. I expected that I would read about a heartwarming community of mountain people who had it rough but helped each other through the tough times. I have to admit that I only got a third of the way through this. I never connected to the main character like I had hoped, and I could tell that it was only going to get worse. So many of the women in this story act in a way that I wouldn't have imagined women in the 30s to act like. The number of incidents of women getting knocked up, committing adultery (including one that comes as a big shock), and acting hypersexual by having sex with anyone anywhere is really high. Since I decided to stop reading, I read some of the reviews of the 1 to 3 stars, and I'm glad that I decided to stop. The main character makes some decisions that are damaging to others and doesn't seem to have remorse.

The name for me evokes memories of long days spent happily lost in books that speak to the minds and hearts of mountain girls everywhere. Oral History, Family Linen, Black Mountain Breakdown, The Devil's Dream, Saving Grace, and my particular favorite, Fair and Tender Ladies. I know so many of the women in these books, and I have been one or two of them. Thought provoking, funny, tender, haunting; each book has a meaning far beyond the story. The richness of detail about mountain life, the deep understanding of the people and their ways and thoughts, and above all the portrayal of the changes that the modern world has inflicted on a proud people are woven into the stories.The Friends of the Library in Floyd, with the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, is hosting a wonderful series of author talks entitled \"Celebrate the Past/Look to the Future\". Lee Smith was the speaker at last night's gathering at the Presbyterian Church in Floyd, Virginia. Surrounded by wooden paneled walls, purple carpet and stained glass, Lee Smith was as charming and funny as her books. Haunting as well, as she spoke of personal experience and personal loss, inspiration for the writer from Grundy who grew up surrounded by story. Mountain people love story, playing with words and evoking emotion with family tales, complicated jokes and the richness of memory. Lee Smith's writings capture this love.She spoke most about her more recent book, The Last Girls, another favorite of mine. I didn't realize that part of the plot was based on a trip she took in college down the Mississippi on a raft. Smith's description of this trip and the girls she traveled with rocked the large audience with laughter. Readings from the book describing the characters, accented in a true mountain voice, were both hilarious and touching. The charm of the writer echoed the charm of her books; she was funny, tender, thought-provoking and haunting, just like her written words.She also talked about Fair and Tender Ladies, a novel written during a time of personal crisis for her. I think for a true writer the characters often take over the book, and Smith talked of Ivy Rowe, the main character in Fair and Tender Ladies, as if she were a friend. Ivy Rowe is the one character in all of her books that I can call to mind as a complete person. She is plucky and sensuous, proud and loving. Some of the reason may be that I saw an actress portray the character several years ago at the Reynolds Homestead here in Patrick County. After the program the director introduced favorite cousin and me to the actress. Mary startled me by describing me as sensuous. A bit of self-realization there, thanks to Lee Smith.I looked around the audience as Lee Smith spoke. Floyd County is a unique blending of cultures. Women with deep roots that span generations in these mountains sat with women of different backgrounds, drawn to Floyd by the beauty of the countryside and feeling of community. Every face has a story, all unique, but all about the experience of being women in changing times. Lee Smith has captured these stories in the pages of her novels, speaking with tender understanding of the mountain people that are so often misrepresented and ridiculed. Speaking with pride in an accent that is fast becoming rare because of outside influences, these novels, as fiction, reveal more than truth about a disappearing time and generation."}, {"userName": "Donna Brown", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2214749-donna-brown", "userReview": "This is a good book. Maybe even a very good book. But it is a long book. since it covers a woman's lifetime, I suppose it has a right to be, but sometimes it drags. others it skips quickly through some seemingly important parts of her life, particularly births and children's early years, without a backward glance. And there are, literally, hundreds of characters. I think one mark of a really good author is, when referring to a long lost character, the ability with a few words to remind the reader how they fit into the story earlier.The thing I loved most about this book was her description of her mountain home and the people there. I lived in the North Carolina Smokies for about six months in my wild and woolly youth, and it has always stayed with me. Her descriptions took me back to those gorgeous woods and cliffs and hollers.Ivy's first love in her life is books. She passes up a chance to leave home and get a real education, which I understand, What doesn't make sense is what a big swath of her life and her children's lives are spent without books. I think she would have found a way or at least sorrowed over the fact that she couldn't. one last thing: she leaves her home and family when she's 40 to follow a man for lust. They go to the top of the mountain and live on berriez and varmints without even a change of clothes. He gets tired of her and brings her home. I'm sorry, but that just does not compute. I understand following for a few days of lust, but a whole year? Never worrying about her family or wanting a change of clothes? I ran off with an iron worker to live in a trailer park in Cartersville for the same reason, but the only people I was responsible to were my parents, who in my mind didn't count. And it only lasted about two weeks. But the lust was good, I must say.Anyway, I'm not sorry I read this book, but it's a good read in many ways.
