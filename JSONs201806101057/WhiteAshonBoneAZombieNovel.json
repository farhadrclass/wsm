But that doesn't seem to stop anyone from writing them. And while some of them are actually very good and manage to distinguish themselves from the rest with original ideas and/or excellent writing and characters, this author decided not to bother with any of that. As a result here is an utterly predictable, forgettable book with zombies written seemingly for the sole purpose of livening the incredibly boring boonies PA, where the author resides. Seriously, reading this book one is reminded of why Pennsylvania remains the only conservative close minded state in that part of the country. No one is particularly bright and everyone owns and lives by guns. Anyone who might be rise above that low set IQ bar is severely mocked, in one instance 3, seriously 3, back to back lawyer jokes and not even very funny ones. The book has a highly misogynistic vibe, women are pretty much stupid, helpless, vapid or some combination of the above. The men are all armed, dangerous and uber capable, of course. The author didn't even bother giving the book a proper ending, it just sort of left of with a note that the sequel is being in the works. Since there is no listing for it anywhere, it looks like at least the author came to his senses and quit while behind. George Romero's zombies made rural PA terrifying, this author's zombies didn't even come close. Total waste of almost 3 hours."}, {"userName": "Garrett", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/421425-garrett", "userReview": "This was an enjoyable and quick zombie read. Basic rundown. The zombie apocalypse breaks out in Western Pennsylvania. This book follows the survivors ... and some zombie snacks ... as they deal with the outbreak. The characters are interesting and I found myself rooting for them.The major detraction for me with this book was the grammatical errors that cropped up on nearly every page. It really takes the reader out of the story when one of the hospitalized characters lapses into a punctuation mark (\"fell into a comma\"). Hopefully, the author will correct these in any future editions or stories.In the afterword the author talks about writing a sequel to this volume. If he does, I might take a look at it."}, {"userName": "Ariel Mathis", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17281109-ariel-mathis", "userReview": "I love this zombie story. Well written, action packed, & zombies trying to eat you. What more could a girl ask for? I guess there is one thing but it seems to be an occuring theme in zombie stories & that is, HOW DID IT START? I'm guessing that it's just unexplainable. Yet, it does little in the way of keeping me from reading zombie books. Especially this one!! The characters are well developed so much so that I HAD to know how it ended. The end, it was AWESOME!! There will be a sequel, yay!! Overall, zombtastic read!!"}, {"userName": "Kim Luu", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3866927-kim-luu", "userReview": "This book is a standout for zombie novels. The author did not break any new grounds in concepts but the character developments and pacing is excellent. The actions and reactions are realistic. I appreciate that there were no amazing super humans with incredible shooting skills in here. After all, some readers are normal people who have never even seen a gun.The story originates in a small town in Pennsylvania and imagines what the start of a zombie apocalypse would be like from patient zero. The stories bounces from local officials to the average man. We also get glimpses of the characters' history to build emotional connection.There is nothing new in the storyline that you wouldn't have seen in hundreds of other zombie novels but I would recommend the book. It's well written and an enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "Angel Leto", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12233669-angel-leto", "userReview": "A fabulous read and an insight into a zombie take over.

The writing is consistently excellent and the attention to detail, especially the government and civil militias' reactions, is greatly appreciated.I hope the sequel will soon be published, if it hasn't already."}, {"userName": "Shawn Manning", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253226-shawn-manning", "userReview": "Nothing new here, but competently written. There are times when the dialog reminded me of Heinlein. However, if poor editing annoys you, avoid this one. I do not know who, or if the author used as proofreader, but he really needs to look around for someone else."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29876306-connie", "userReview": "A good readI enjoyed the story but had some trouble staying interested,parts got to drawn out ,I was thinking ,ok enough I get the picture,but still I stuck with it and I must say I was not satisfied with the ending,"}], "description": "The story is set in my home town of Butler, Pennsylvania. Classically, the region is the heart of zombie lore. I grew up watching zombie movies that were filmed just down the road. It certainly can impact a young mind.The novel starts out on what should be an average day. A demented prisoner in the drunk-tank, who happens to be subject zero, is brought before a judge to have his case reviewed. He breaks away, and violence soon spills outside of the courtroom.White Ash on Bone follows groups of citizens who band together for survival as society breaks apart around them. This is not a story about living in a post-apocalyptic world that is already overrun by the undead. This is a story about trying to survive in the first days of the collapse.I really tried to capture both small and large scale events in the novel. For example, one group of survivors might be trying to hide out in a garage while another group is watching the military try and maintain a collapsing stronghold in Pittsburgh.I did not feel the need to make my zombies extra-ordinary. They move, some a little faster than others, but you won\u2019t see them climbing up walls. What you get in the story is an ever growing horde beating in your front door.", "title": "White Ash on Bone: A Zombie Novel", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16136790-white-ash-on-bone", "average": 3.6, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1356899168l/16136790.jpg", "reviews": 10, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6574956.Jason_Campagna", "name": "Jason Campagna"}], "type": ["Horror", "Horror", "Science Fiction", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16136790-white-ash-on-bone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18926756-white-ash-on-bone"]}
