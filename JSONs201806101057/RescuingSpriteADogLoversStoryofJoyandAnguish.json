The book was just a promotional piece for the author. I can't tell you how many times he mentioned the other book he had written and his radio talk show. I do appreciate the fact he gave this dog a home, or rather is wife did, since I have rescue dogs myself. But the writing was bad, the tone morbid, and the self-promotion unappreciated. Plus he really lost me once he mentioned he was close friends with Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh. I'm sure they're great guys in his inner circle but I can't agree with their politics or tactics.

Quite a few mentioned that they felt the book wasn't written well and still more thought that Levin was plugging his other book and radio show throughout this book. I disagree with both of those opinions. From what I remember, Levin mentioned his other book one, maybe twice. He mentioned his radio show several times but every time he had a reason. That show is a part of his life and his dogs were also, somewhat, involved. Being that this book is about his life, his family's life, and the dogs in their family, it's only \"right\" that his show be mentioned. It would be the same as a bank teller writing the book and mentioned coming home from the bank. Or the supermarket or the marketing firm in the city. I didn't see any shameless plugging at all. What I did is a dog-lover in the truest sense. Most of the books like this that I've read I've liked. There was one that I hated because, in my opinion, the author wasn't a dog lover at all- I saw right through him and his book. But the ones I like the most are the very personal stories- the ones that let you in to more than the dogs lives alone, but the families as well. And this did that for me. I think some people will feel it's written poorly because of the simple sentences. I don't agree with that either personally. I wouldnt agrue that it's a literary masterpiece, it's not, but it is a good story about this man's dogs. I fell in love with the dogs from the beginning of the book and I enjoyed reading about their day to day activities. I also liked the rest of Levin's family, as they were portrayed throughout the book. There are way more negative and/or less than positive reviews than I expected to find so I would just like to urge anyone thinking about reading this and reading the reviews beforehand to try it for themselves. I believe Levin and his whole family are true dog lovers and I enjoyed the book the whole time, very much actually. Don't let the other reviews stop you from reading- this can help a person who has lost a pet. Like Levin says, sometimes it helps just to know others have been, and made it through, the same thing. When I was looking at this in Wal-Mart the other day I was thinking about buying it. (I probably knew in my head that I already would but....)

I felt it was too drawn out, he was searching for sentiment where he felt it should have been (I agree, it had potential as a heart wrenching story) but fell short. Extremely short. Sentences were simple and without emotion or vocabulary that truly expressed what he was attempting to portray. He should have condensed this book into a short story complete with MANY more photographs. It would have been far more enjoyable! I still found myself tearing up, even shed a few tears despite the book's shortcomings and that I DIDN'T EVEN FINISH IT!

In fact, the first half was just awful. The story would be more touching without the details of his radio show and knowing that his best friends are Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and hearing what great guys they both are and where they all go on vacation together.The decisions and feelings during and after Sprite's passing were still touching. It seemed like his wife, son, and daughter wer sort of left out and it was all on Mark, but I'm pretty sure that wasn't actually the case and is a result of the author's inability to write about feelings other than his own.

I mean--what's not to like? It's about an abandoned dog who is rescued and adopted and the dog eventually dies. It has all the elements I would normally love - animals, pathos, tear-jerking finales.But Mark R. Levin (radio talk show host and author of the best-selling book, \"Men in Black: How the Supreme Court is Destroying America\") gives it all the warmth of a book about the Supreme Court. \"Marley\" tells the same story, but John Grogan does it with such style that we love Marley and we weep at his demise.Levin gives us nothing to love. It's a dog, everybody worshipped him, and he died. We don't get a feel for his quirks, for his personality. We get an overly long gut-wrenching treatise on the decision to end his suffering, and an overblown period of guilt that they didn't do more to save him.I'm certainly not a heartless person. I've loved, and lost dogs (and a cat or two). I have buried children. I know the pain of loss, but Levin's problem is not making us care about Sprite the way we did about Marley. In the end the book seems overly maudlin and, quite frankly, self-serving. I'm not sure why it was a best seller except, perhaps, that people like me who gobble up books like this thought we might be discovering another \"Marley.\"We weren't.Don't waste your time on this book."}, {"userName": "SJ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/309759-sj", "userReview": "This isn't my normal sort of book and I would never have picked it up on my own. My father is an avid dog lover, and NOT an avid reader at all. So the fact that he had read anything at all was worth noting. He gave me his copy of the book and insisted I give it a try. The author is no dummy, but he waters down his own personality so much that I found myself irritated with his portrayal of himself and his family with constant perfection. Still, for all that it lacked in literary value, I admit to sobbing myself stupid at various points. If you've ever loved a pet with all your heart and soul, and then lost that dear friend, then you'll understand what this book is trying to explain.

Fiction, non-fiction; it doesn't matter. Sprite was a beautiful dog. I have no doubt that he was sweet and loving and that knowing him and loving him enriched the lives of the Levin family. Having lost dogs in my life that I loved dearly, I'm sure that writing about Sprite was very cathartic for the author. Mark Levin says in his acknowledgments that many people didn't think that he could tell Sprite's story, because it was so different from anything he'd ever written. Unfortunately, they were right.Horribly written. Maybe I'm just a literature snob, but reading it was painful. I had to force myself to finish it, and not because of what was happening in the story, but because it was like reading a book that had been written by a 5th grader with no real life experience. Levin reports things as they happen with little personal insight and comes off as somebody who has lived a charmed and painless existence up until Sprite. I didn't think it could get any worse, but then the author introduces us to his \"best friends\" Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Ugh. Up until that point, I had wondered how such a poorly written book had found a large traditional publisher. I hate to give a book a bad review. Any time an author sits down to write, he/she is putting themself all the way out there. But this is one book I wish I'd passed on.

Levin prominent radio talk show host, president of Landmark Legal Foundation, attorney, top advisor and administrator to President Reagan\u2019s cabinet, author of the New York Times bestseller Men in Black: How the Supreme Court is Destroying America and self proclaimed \u201cdog lover\u201d intentionally leaves the reader feeling that the bond between man and his best friend is more than mutual, \u201cin the end, we humans are the lucky ones.\u201d The publication of Levin\u2019s book (Rescuing Sprite: A Dog Lover\u2019s Story of Joy and Anguish. Pocket Books: N.Y. 2007.pp.216.) follows exactly one year on the heels of John Grogan\u2019s Marley and Me, which was released in movie theaters this holiday season. Grogan\u2019s humorous retelling of the adventures of his miscreant pup, Marley, fits the Disney tradition of The Shaggy Dog. Although Rescuing Sprite is less comic, it is more emotive.  I loved this dog. Writing this book was both painful and cathartic for me. Reading it may be emotional for you. I hope it brings you some smiles. I know it will bring you some tears. I hope, when you\u2019re done, that you are moved to hold your dog closer in your arms- or in your memories. (Levin,3) Six years after adopting Pepsi, Levin\u2019s wife conspiring with his children cajole him into rescuing another mixed breed which they name Sprite. Pepsi and Sprite become inseparable brothers. Sprite is described as a beautiful, gentle tempered dog that always enjoyed sniffing a good breeze. After two years it was determined that Sprite was older and less healthy than originally thought. From the diagnosis of a nerve tumor toSprite\u2019s passing, the joys and sorrows of the family are poignantly recounted. Although the disease disfigured and disabled Sprite\u2019s body, his spirit grew more graceful and beautiful. The book ends with a beginning as they welcome Griffen (father and son put the stopper on fizzy soda pop names) into the Levin clan. Biggio Rescuing Sprite 2  Particularly notable in the book are the photos by daughter, Lauren, and sympathetic email from friends and fans. Mark Dean in an email recounts the following old American Indian legend: In ancient times, when man and animals communicated as equals a crack in the earth erupted. Man was on one side and the animals were on the other. The crevice grew wider and wider separating them and just before it became too large to traverse, the dog alone jumped over the chasm so that he could stay with man. (Levin,126) Dogs are communicators and teachers. In their silence they offer us peace and understanding. In their behavior, they teach us life\u2019s most basic lesson of unconditional love. In their suffering they teach us what Hemingway called,\u201d grace under pressure\u201d. If there is a Rainbow Bridge, which this reader believes, Sprite and all of our beloved canines will be waiting for our leap of faith.Mark R. Levin will donate a portion of the proceeds from this book to animal shelters."}, {"userName": "Marie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2255253-marie", "userReview": "i just loved this book and couldn't put it down. i cried! i don't usually cry, but when it comes to pets, i have quite a spot in my heart for them.

Six years later, his wife and son persuaded him to adopt a dog from the local shelter, a Spaniel mix. It turned out he was older than originally thought, and he was the most beautiful dog they'd ever seen. They named him Sprite. Their lives would never be the same.During the next two years, Sprite and Pepsi were inseparable. And Sprite's bond with the Levin family deepened. Friends, neighbors, and even Mark's radio audience came to know and love Sprite. But Sprite's health deteriorated -- even as his spirits remained high and his beauty and grace continued to inspire.

I finished it because I wanted to like it. I wanted to feel a connection to this dog. And while he sounds like a sweet dog, he sounds just like any other dog too! There was nothing that made me laugh out loud or cry or anything like I did with Marley & Me. This author just wasn't good. I feel like he started writing about his experience with Sprite to get his own feelings out when the dog died - kind of a sense of therapy for him. Then he decided to turn it into a book, and I don't know how he got a published to agree to it. It reminded me of a child's classroom essay - similar to the papers my 5th grader currently writes. I did cry when Sprite was put to sleep, but geesh - who cares how badly written it is, of course I'm going to cry when a dog dies! This book was really, really bad.

As a book, it becomes somewhat repetitive as Mark tells us many times how much he loves Sprite and how he is suffering both the potential loss and then the actual loss, and how he second=guesses the decisions he made in regards to Sprite's health care and the decision to put the dog to sleep. Mark agonizes, I sympathize. That doesn't make it a great book. It is simplistic in its grammatical construction and short on substance. The substance is Mark Levin has a broken heart. As someone who has suffered a broken heart over the accidental death of one of my children, well I understand a broken heart and that it does not act logically nor respond to the dictates or logic of others. But there are only so many ways to say I am bereaved, and only so long that your heartbreak will hold the attention of the reader. So I sympathized but found my attention drifting as I wondered about his good friend Rush Limbaugh, and I pondered the ethical pros and cons of putting an animal to sleep.  I only caught a couple of Rush Limbaugh's shows back in the 1990's. I remember his slying saying that there was a new dog in the White House and up came a picture of Chelsea Clinton who must have been about 13 at the time. I thought that was so cruel that I never watched another of his shows and I haven't liked him since, although I read another book where a good friend of his talks about how kind and thoughtful Rush Limbaugh was to him in his time of need. I can't remember who that was now. No matter. So I am willing to concede that Rush Limbaugh can be a good friend, despite his cruelty to a young teenage girl on National Television.  i felt the pain and guilt of Mr. Levin in putting Sprite to sleep. How easy we use that euphemism, \"put to sleep\". i can't judge, but i hope that decision will not be mine to make, ever. I'm pretty sure I would not choose to put to sleep. When I was a young child our cat was nearly cut in half by the fan belt of our car. My dad was going to shoot him but we all screamed so much that my mom rushed him to the vet. Eight hours of surgery and weeks of recovery saved his life. He lived until I was in college when he finally died a natural death from cancer. i just don't know that we have the wisdom to know when life should be ended.

One of the shows I listen to on a regular basis is the Mark Levin Show. In December 2006, he lost a very special friend and family member, his dog Sprite. After some urging from friends, he decided to write a book about the experience of rescuing this dog, living and loving him, and then having to make the awful decision to put him to sleep after only having had him in his family for 2 years.If you are a dog lover, you should read this book. Even if you're not necessarily a dog lover, you should read this book to understand how deep our affection goes (and why it runs deep) for these wonderful animals. It will be hard, and you will cry. I'm not just talking a few tears here, either, I mean you will cry and snuffle and have to go find some tissues to mop up the liquid your eyes will release. (My eyes are all swelly this morning!) But it is worth it to share in the joy that Mark and his family had with this sweet dog. Sprite taught the Levins many lessons, and subsequently, he's still teaching them as well as those of us who read the book. He had had a hard life, yet he kept a bright disposition down to his very last day when he was disoriented and exhausted from his illness. He was a tender friend to Mark, his wife, and their daughter and son. I know they still miss him dearly.I won't tell more about the book because I want you to read it and see for yourself what a blessing this dog was, and I'm sure many dogs have been, including one that you have now or had in the past. Reading this book made me remember the good times I spent with my two favorite pups, Ginger from my childhood, and Reagan from my late teens/early twenties.

Maybe I'm a little on the stoic side, but I was pretty uncomfortable with the extreme emotion Levin pours out onto the pages of his book. I'm also of the opinion that a dog ought to be allowed to be a dog and not treated like another child in the family. Dogs aren't humans like we often forget. I say let them chase deer here and there. There is no danger in them getting killed by a kick, because deer will outrun them any time. I also say let them run unhindered by a leash in a fenced area or a solitary walk on an uninhabited mountain where they will likely roll in something or chew on something revolting. They are dogs after all. That's what they like to do! And above all. . . .have a lot of fun with them. Dogs are great for lifting the spirits with their unconditional love which they show so enthusiastically any time you come home. It's really something to smile about. (Not that you shouldn't have a few good cries when they die.) Dogs do give their owners much joy. It's just too bad Mr. Levin seems so terribly depressed about the whole thing.

Although this book explores human emotion and understanding the loss of a dog, I never felt like the author tried to make it all about himself. I can see that other people did think that, perhaps because of the casual name dropping. I'm Australian however, the only other reference I've seen to Rush Limbaugh is on Family Guy. I honestly felt like this was a touching tribute to a dog that did not get the full life experience living with this wonderful family, but the time they had made an impact.

Horribly simplistic and unreaslistic that someone would shoulder the blame for the health issues besought on this poor dog, to me the author seems to be seeking praise and attention for having to deal with everyday issues of being a pet owner. He also seems to put much more emphasis on his dogs vs. his family and espcially his own parents - in the book it was an afterthought that he visit his ailing father when he happened to be in town. Focused entirely too much on the author and mundane happenings encountered by every dog owner on a daily basis (ie, the dog loved to put his snout up in the breeze, or the dogs would give a welcome bark to every delivery person, or the dogs sat by me at dinner every night), I really struggled to even get through the book.

Tears were rolling down my eyes reading about the Levin's love for their dogs and their loss of Sprite. It was endearing to read about a man actually expressing such emotion at the loss of his dog. I am a big fan of Mark Levin AND his politics and NOT afraid to admit it! The other posts on critiquing the book simply because you don't agree with his political affiliation..................please put your politics aside and rate a book simply for its content!"}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/786846-christina", "userReview": "my dad gave each of my brothers and me this book as a Christmas present and he added that it was so good that it made him cry.

It is a wonderful book. I can identify with Mark and his family and their grief. I had a Peke for 12 years and when we had to put him down, it was hard. Back in 1992 I had to put down our 12 year old poodle, Chewie, and it was hard then too. I miss both of them very much.I reccommend this book to all dog lovers, but keep the tissuses handy, as you will cry.It was a wonderful book."}, {"userName": "Jessica Slates", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/626150-jessica-slates", "userReview": "My Dad got this book for me a few days after we had to put our beloved, beautiful golden retriever, Tucker, to sleep.

As a relatively new dog lover, one of the worst things I can imagine is losing my dog. I cried as they had to let go of Sprite and will keep this book as a primer of sorts for what is to come.

In 1998, he and his family welcomed a half-Border Collie/half-Cocker Spaniel they named Pepsi into their lives. Six years later, his wife and son persuaded him to adopt a dog from the local shelter, a Spaniel mix. It turned out he was older than originally thought, and he was the most beautiful dog they'd ever seen. They named him Sprite. Their lives would never be the same. Sprite and Pepsi became fast friends. They did everything together, from rummaging through the trash to loudly greeting the deliveryman. And the Levin family fell in love with him -- with his gentle nature, beautiful face and soft, huggable fur. But on Halloween night, shortly after joining their family, Sprite suddenly collapsed and was rushed to the animal hospital. It was the first of many such visits, and the start of a long journey for the Levin family, filled with much joy and anguish. During the next two years, Sprite and Pepsi were inseparable. And Sprite's bond with the Levin family deepened. Friends, neighbors, and even Mark's radio audience came to know and love Sprite. As Mark's daughter turned eighteen and graduated from high school and Mark's son turned fifteen, Sprite's health deteriorated -- even as his spirits remained high and his beauty and grace continued to inspire. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas 2006, the Levin family said their emotional final goodbye. Crushed and consumed with grief, Mark turned to family, friends, and fans for help. But new hope came when the Levins least expected it.Rescuing Sprite is a stunningly intimate look at the love between a family and a dog, one that movingly shows, in Mark Levin's words, that \"in the end, we humans are the lucky ones.\"The author will donate a portion of his proceeds from the sale of this book to animal shelters.", "title": "Rescuing Sprite: A Dog Lover's Story of Joy and Anguish", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/994192.Rescuing_Sprite", "average": 3.92, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348975891l/994192.jpg", "reviews": 406, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/311467.Mark_R_Levin", "name": "Mark R.
