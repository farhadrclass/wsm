Her first invaluable gem of wisdom? \u201cYoung or beginning writers must be urged to read widely, ceaselessly, both classics and contemporaries, for without an immersion in the history of the craft, one is doomed to remain an amateur: an individual for whom enthusiasm is ninety-nine percent of the creative effort.\" Which means that only readers become writers\u2014already, this has been highlighted over and over ad nauseum by the likes of Stephen King, Francine Prose, Mario Vargas Llosa and plenty others. Of course, her \u201cfaith as a writer\u201d is her personal poetics themselves\u2014already on page one she has set down her beliefs; the core of her craft. \u201cThe individual voice,\u201d she tells us, \u201cis the communal voice. The regional voice is the universal voice.\"Musing about the origin of your reading addiction is a pleasant and constant activity. JCO makes us all sigh in relief when she recalls her first memories with literature. Although I particularly abhor the Alice books, I do agree with JCO in her assessment that as a child, the allure of books contained the \u201cvoices of adult authenticity.\" Wanting to grow up, indeed, goes hand in hand with constantly reading about adult themes and situations. When in elementary school, the avid reader, the smart kid, finds that there are riches beyond his wildest dreams in books by King, and Anne Rice, and anything that is strange and fascinating, and he finally leaves behind short adolescent novels by the likes of R. L. Stine, Stephanie Meyer, and Judy Blume.In \u201cTo a Young Writer\u201d we are once more showered with damn good advice. A list: 1) \u201cyour struggle\u2026your emotions\u2026make possible hours, days, weeks, months and years of what will appear to others\u2026as \u2018work\u2019.\u201d2) Don\u2019t lose courage or compare yourself to others (\u201cif you want confirmation of your essential worthlessness, you can always find it, somewhere\").3) \u201cWrite for your own time, if not for your own generation exclusively.\"4) \u201cimmerse\u201d yourself in whatever strikes you\u2014be as idealist, romantic, \u201cyearning\u201d as you wish, for this will come to your aid.5) And Write your heart out, she repeats and repeats, like some magic, poetic mantra. Again, a sigh of relief emanates from me, with JCO\u2019s advice #3. I write contemporary stuff\u2014so that\u2019s clearly a plus\u2014it certainly does inspire relief.One facet of the writer\u2019s life no other writer has, to my knowledge, made mere mention of as of yet is that of failure. In \u201cNotes on Failure\u201d JCO wisely tells her readers that the writer is a bizarre creature (duh); some masochistically believe in the needlepoint philosophy of \u201cBeware the danger in happiness!\u201d even though they have an \u201caddictive nature of incompletion and risk.\"Also, I am glad that in \u201cInspiration!\u201d there is an appropriate mention of the early Surrealists\u2014perhaps \"Synesthetes\" is majorly affected by their haunting influence?\u2014of which JCO writes: \u201c[Their] images were, at the outset, purely ordinary images, decontextualized and made strange.\u201d I think this is the modern condition of every single writer living today: with every single plot and character type already having been discovered, there is only one genuine chance of creating a masterpiece by picking out (\u201cborrowing\") what works for that singular piece itself. Perhaps the best reason to listen to JCO (What?! No recommended reading?!) is that, although she is incredibly prolific and has incredible range (novels, poetry, YA fiction, story collections, plays, essays\u2026), she, too, knows a twinge about failure. I will admit that I\u2019ve read gems of hers, novels such as Zombie and Black Water, but blatant crap like Oprah Book Club selection We Were the Mulvaneys is so totally disappointing, especially since she was already a literary behemoth by that time, that the legend of JCO becomes completely human\u2014and that, at least, I can empathize with. The Faith of a Writer is essential: both reassuring and realistic."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6971227-david", "userReview": "There's something really absurd about writing a book about writing a book. Every mind is so different, and what works for one, will not work for another; so inevitably these books (Oates' The Faith of a Writer, Lamott's Bird by Bird - which I only recently learned isn't about bird-counting, who knew right?, the many, many \"On Writing\"-esque pretensions) are not about \"how to write\" but are an entirely egotistical account of \"how I write.\"That is the obvious shortcoming of this book. But it is somewhat saved by the the grace of Joyce's literary slant. She analyzes not just the process of writing well, but analyzes examples of what is well-written. She attempts to bridge the gap between her personal methodology and the universal standard of writing. Despite her anecdotal histories, her idiosyncrasies and inconsistencies in her writing practice, her goals are constant, her idols are set firmly upon the tabernacle of creation. The real value of this book is not in the \"how to write\" bollocks, but rather in her attached and unaffected reverence for literature, her humility and her elegance, reminiscent of Woolf. She tells us:\nOne is born not to suffer but to negotiate with suffering, to choose or invent forms to accommodate it.\nAnd for her, writing (and running) is a way to negotiate that suffering and pain, with the beauty of potential, of fiction. Fiction is not what is, but what might have been, could have been, or maybe could never have been. Fiction is a lie which deceives only to enlighten (cruel only to be kind) - a lie which mediates what is with something that is not: something inexplicable and out of control with a fictive world shackled and led only by the writer's imagination. Why do we suffer? why do others hurt us and why do we hurt? why can't we have what we want? In the real world these answers must inevitably escape being fastened down, but in fiction we can reconcile those questions with answers which follow strictly the logic of the world we create.FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR GENERAL RULES OF WRITING, IN LIST FORM:From Mark Twain:1. A tale shall accomplish something and arrive somewhere.2. The episodes of a tale shall be necessary parts of the tale, and shall help develop it.3. The personages in a tale shall be alive, except in the case of corpses, and that always the reader shall be able to tell the corpses from the others.4. The personages in a tale, both dead and alive, shall exhibit a sufficient excuse for being there.5. When the personages of a tale deal in conversation, the talk shall sound like human talk, and be talk such as human beings would be likely to talk in the given circumstances, and have a discoverable meaning, also a discoverable purpose, and a show of relevancy, and remain in the neighborhood of the subject in hand, and be interesting to the reader, and help out the tale, and stop when the people cannot think of anything more to say.6. When the author describes the character of a personage in his tale, the conduct and conversation of that personage shall justify said description.7. When a personage talks like an illustrated, gilt-edged, tree-calf, hand-tooled, seven-dollar Friendship's Offering in the beginning of a paragraph, he shall not talk like a Negro minstrel at the end of it.8. Crass stupidities shall not be played upon the reader by either the author or the people in the tale.9. The personages of a tale shall confine themselves to possibilities and let miracles alone; or, if they venture a miracle, the author must so plausably set it forth as to make it look possible and reasonable.10. The author shall make the reader feel a deep interest in the personages of his tale and their fate; and that he shall make the reader love the good people in the tale and hate the bad ones.11. The characters in tale be so clearly defined that the reader can tell beforehand what each will do in a given emergency.An author should:12. Say what he is proposing to say, not merely come near it.13. Use the right word, not its second cousin.14. Eschew surplusage.15. Not omit necessary details.16. Avoid slovenliness of form.17. Use good grammar.18. Employ a simple, straightforward style.From Elmore Leonard:1. Never open a book with weather.2. Avoid prologues.3. Never use a verb other than \"said\" to carry dialogue.4. Never use an adverb to modify the verb \"said\u201d\u2026he admonished gravely.5. Keep your exclamation points under control. You are allowed no more than two or three per 100,000 words of prose. 6. Never use the words \"suddenly\" or \"all hell broke loose.\"7. Use regional dialect, patois, sparingly.8. Avoid detailed descriptions of characters.9. Don't go into great detail describing places and things.10. Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.From Kurt Vonnegut:1. Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.2. Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.3. Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.4. Every sentence must do one of two things \u2013 reveal character or advance the action.5. Start as close to the end as possible.6. Be a Sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them-in order that the reader may see what they are made of.7. Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.8. Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To hell with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.From George Orwell:1. Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.\n*****\nBut honestly, do whatever the hell you want! In writing the only rule is to break the rules! Curmudgeon-y dead white guys be damned."}, {"userName": "Emma Sea", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5558652-emma-sea", "userReview": "meh. dnf at p. 182. i think i have no soul."}, {"userName": "Megankellie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/85501-megankellie", "userReview": "She says \"memesis.\"Reading this, I felt angry, bored and jealous.

Oates tells us that 'writing is not a race ... the satisfaction is in the effort.' She presents what is important to the narrative craft and so much here is like a good meal. She writes a whole chapter here on failure: are artists (writers) secretly in love with failure?

To that end, I have been exposing myself to essays by a variety of writers, some familiar to me, some not. I was actually searching for something else by Joyce Carol Oates, when I happened upon this small volume and thought I would give it a try. By the time I finished this book, sadly I was pretty convinced that in spite of the fact that I have been telling people for the past two year that I write memoir and personal essay, that perhaps I do not like the form at all. Perhaps what I write is not personal essay? Perhaps I don't like to read what I like to write? I am not blaming Joyce Carol Oates or this book in particular. I have been getting more and more discouraged over the first six weeks of this year, when having read something over 45 essays I have found less than a handful that I actually liked. None that I found exceptional. I hope no one feels the need to judge me or my genres as harshly as I judge others. I would be devastated. And, in fact, I feel the need to take responsibility for all of this myself, rather than placing the blame on the writers or the form. But, frankly, I just don't get a lot of the essays I read. It is like they try so hard, so self-consciously to be more than what they are, that they end up just leaving me in the dust by the side of the road. I am not giving up, in fact I have already started another collection of essays by another writer. There are essays out there that I am going to like, going to love, going to want to emulate. I just know it. I feel it in my ever-increasingly-creaky bones. Sorry JCO.

I liked what I have read, but I am overwhelmed by the volume of her writing. When a new Oates book comes out, I usually think about reading it, but there are other authors who I have never read. This book crossed my path and I decided it was time to read Oates again.I did not know that Oates is an atheist. So, to be honest, I thought these essays were about faith in God. However, it is very clear in the first short essay that Oates\u2019 faith is in art not God. She writes, \u201cI believe that art is the highest expression of the human spirit.\u201d p. 1. Once I had read that, I knew this book would not be about religious faith.Maybe because I started with the wrong assumption, I found myself slogging through this book. The writing is excellent, but Oates is writing for those who might want to write themselves. Except for book reviews and my personal journal, I have no desire to put pen to paper. So much of what she says did not interest me.I don\u2019t know why I kept reading, but when I go to the essay titled \u201cReading as a Writer,\u201d I knew that I had found something of interest. Even though I don\u2019t want to write, I am fascinated by why people read. Reading what Oates feels is important for writers to read, gave me insights to the act of reading.

Art is, in great part, our communication with each other, our attempt as social animals to connect, but first and foremost, as Oates goes on to describe, it is our solitary striving to go deep - into ourselves, connecting with our innermost and hidden hearts. In this collection of essays, Oates, known perhaps more for her amazing ability to be one of the most prolific writers of all time (something she says in one of her essays that she does not quite understand, that is, why she is seen as prolific ... to which point, I urge the author to check out her own list of published works, in and of itself a short book), examines the art and craft of writing. These are not necessarily essays written one to build upon another, but separate and independent pieces, including an interview done with Oates to discuss her fictionalized history of Marilyn Monroe, \"Blonde.\" Included in this collection are biographical essays on how Oates grew up, her childhood and one-room school days, a time of discovery that reading books was entering a new world beyond this one. Fittingly, \"Alice in Wonderland\" was the first book that so mesmerized her and has kept its hold on her lifelong. Dropping down the rabbit hole into a world that was a surprise at every turn, where all things were open to re-creation, where one is never quite sure one will be able to return fully to that other reality, is not unlike the life of a writer. Also, essays on honing the craft prior to the art - and that would always begin, and never end, with reading. Reading and reading, endlessly reading, and she puts an almost equal importance on reading the classics, but no less the not quite classics, such as comic books. All can teach the writer - something about language, something about storyline, something about plot movement and suspense and conflict and resolution. It is not so much what one reads as that one reads. There are also essays on a writer's space, what it might and should contain, the art of self criticism, the squishy business of inspiration, surely important notes on failure, and others along that vein. Even a piece on running and writing, how Oates finds that much of her writing happens first in her head, long before it reaches paper (she writes her first drafts always in long-hand), and so running seems to be an activity especially conducive to unstringing such creative and transportive trains of thought. Above all, Oates states, immerse yourself. If writing is about craft first, the learning of grammar and sentence structure (and she is one of those writers who revises as she writes) and other such primary tools, then it enters that ephemeral world of Art - like dropping through the rabbit hole - when one dares to leave this world and fully enter into that one. Immersion. Nothing less. \"I believe that we yearn to transcend the merely finite and ephemeral; to participate in something mysterious and communal called 'culture' - and that this yearning is as strong in our species as the yearning to reproduce the species.\" Perhaps because fine art, in any medium, is itself a kind of reproducing the species. And giving it new life. While this is not my favorite book of writer writing about writing - that spot is reserved for Annie Dillard's \"The Writing Life,\" Bret Lott's \"Before We Get Started: A Practical Memoir of a Writer's Life,\" and Anne Lamott's \"Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life\" - it was satisfying. I found in some ways a kindred spirit, for I, too, prefer a first draft in longhand, revise along the way, feel that writing is like entering a trance not unlike madness, and wrote my first \"masterpieces,\" just as Oates did, even prior to knowing HOW to write. I saw my parents writing, and although I had no idea what those scribbles meant, I was well amused to sit for hours doing the same. Rows and rows of looping and connected lines, containing magic. With a writer's faith that someday, somehow, someone will read my scribbles and sense the magic, too. As did Oates, today as mesmerized by that process as she was as a child. Therein, one suspects, lies the explanation to her ability to be that prolific."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5953510-sara", "userReview": "I'm not really sure where the last hundred or so pages of this book went. I sat down to read it while hitting a dead patch in my writing this afternoon and ended up finishing the book as Oates took me along with her train of thought. I cursed myself the entire time for having checked this book out of the library rather than buying it, thereby not being able to underline and comment and make a general conversational mess of the text (I mean, I could have, but the library probably would have gotten a little pissy with me when I returned the book). As I read, I found myself constantly conversing with Joyce, thinking, \"OHMYGOD you do that too!? That makes me feel SO MUCH BETTER!\" constantly. Since graduating from college, I've found myself in a bit of a dry place as a writer, with no community to speak of and no feeling of camaraderie with anyone who could really understand what I was going through. I've felt like something of an alien, not sure whether these weird \"working people\" could really get what was going on in my brain. But then, Joyce came along and made me feel like I wasn't such a freak and a loser, if only because she spoke so well to my own insecurities. To me, JCO is this prolific, untouchable goddess of literature, churning out more product in a year than I'll probably create in an entire lifetime. She didn't even really seem entirely real, in spite of the fact that I'd been reading her since high school (or maybe because of that), but this story fleshes her out so nicely in her writer persona in the way that her memoir fleshed her out for me as an individual. It was pretty fantastic to see her reference her predecessors and inspirations as well--writers that had an impact for her who also expressed their own thoughts and anxieties. So while I've read ruminations of distant writers on their inadequacy and issues before, JCO's encouragement and insecurities were particularly poignant for me. This may not be the case for everyone, but I really felt that her words were useful for me. I'll definitely be buying this one in the near future, and encourage writers to look this book up. From one writer to another, I can tell you it helps to feel, even peripherally, as if someone else--especially someone of her prolific experience--understands your issues and shares your inspirations."}, {"userName": "LK Hunsaker", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2121270-lk-hunsaker", "userReview": "I enjoy the fiction I've read by Joyce Carol Oates and I intend to read far more of it. As with Marilynne Robinson, however, I found this book about the writing craft a little hard to wade through at times.There are, indeed, several big gems I've bookmarked, but much of it is too based on her own viewpoint that people become writers because they adore language. I was surprised at this stance, given how her novels feel as though they are about the story, not about the language (although, yes, they are well-written), which I believe makes a novel stand out. As a writer who writes because of a love of Story, of the Characters, of Life Journey, I was put off by the essay stating \"it's all about the language.\" Personally, I believe language is a tool of the craft to make the story enjoyable for the reader.Many of the essays are quite \"professorial\" and sound as though she wants us to be sure to realize how well she knows literature and authors. A good thing, to be sure, but I got tired of all of the references and name dropping. I wanted to read about Joyce Carol Oates. If I want to know more about those other writers, I will read them (and I do read avidly).That said, the Self-Criticism and the Writer's Studio essays were my favorites. They are at the end and my guess is a lot of people won't get that far, sadly. The whole \"JCO and I\" bit where she separates herself from her author name put me off. As a literary writer, your books ARE part of who you are and cannot be separated. Yes, the public life can be separated from the private life to an extent, but readers can tell when writers put their hearts and souls into their fiction and telling readers, \"Oh, that's a different part of me, not actually ME\" is not a great idea, as I see it.The Faith of a Writer is worth a read for literary authors. The two mentioned chapters are worth a read for any author. I am well educated with a good vocabulary, but the rather pedantic, academy nature of this non-fic made me set it down too often to read other things instead. I'll stick to her fiction."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3285729-amy", "userReview": "The author of Black Water, Rape: a Love Story and The Tattooed Girl ruminates on writing, including her thoughts on other writers. She discusses inspiration, failure, criticism, influences and reading. It\u2019s an intriguing foray into the writing process from initial concept to final product.I believe that art is the highest expression of the human spirit.Your struggle with your buried self, or selves, yields your art\u2019 these emotions are the fuel that drives your writing and makes possible hours, days, weeks, months and years of what will appear to others, at a distance, as \u201cwork.\u201dDon\u2019t expect to be treated justly by the world. Don\u2019t even expect to be treated mercifully.It is a man\u2019s world; a woman whose sensibility has been stoke by feminism will find much to annoy and offend, but perhaps there\u2019s much to learn, and to be inspired by, if only in knowing what it\u2019s like to be an outsider gazing in.I\u2019ve never thought of writing as the mere arrangement of words on the page but the attempted embodiment of a vision; a complex of emotions; raw experience.Though most of us inhabit degrees of failure or the anticipation of it, very few persons are willing to acknowledge the fact, out of a vague but surely correct sense that it is not altogether American to do so.Of course, writing is an art. And art springs from the depths of the human imagination and is likely to be, in the final analysis as at first glance, idiosyncratic, mysterious, and beyond easy interpretation.The inspiration a writer takes from a predecessor is usually accidental, like the inspirations of our lives; those individuals met by chance who become integral to our destinies. Self-criticism, like self-administered brain surgery, is perhaps not a good idea. Can the \u201cself\u201d see the \u201cself\u201d with any objectivity?To have a reliable opinion of oneself, one must know the subject, and perhaps that isn\u2019t possible.

I own a dozen JCO books, and have finished only one, the shortest. This may be the cruelest thing a fellow writer can say, that she loses me almost always.Be that as it may, 'The Faith of a Writer: life, craft, art' is a book worth reading, if you are a writer. I can't imagine a reader having much to glean from it, unless he or she is that curious kind of reader who doesn't want to 'ignore the man behind the curtain' as the Wizard says. Throughout the book JCO seeks to remind us how normal, mundane, even coarse a writer is, and that writer, having learned one's craft well enough,is mere conduit for expression than generator.\"Writing exists. Writers do not,\" she says. \"No one wants to believe this obvious truth: the artist can inhabit any individual, for the individual is irrelevant to the art.\" If this were true in some perfect form, I would have been able to finish all of the novels I lifted from the bookshelf. Perhaps she has corrupted her perception of the creative act as a thing stepped from a sci-fi tale, where the essence of cognitive energy takes a human form to be transmittable, and in doing so finds itself limited by that form, which is usually human, just to communicate. The book has the value of a workshop conversation, albeit one attended by a freakishly informed speaker. Its worth must be individual, and for that I recommend it. Reads wuickly enough: done in a day."}], "description": "A tribute to the brilliant craftsmanship of one of our most distinguished writers, providing valuable insight into her inspiration and her methodJoyce Carol Oates is widely regarded as one of America's greatest contemporary literary figures. Having written in a number of genres -- prose, poetry, personal and critical essays, as well as plays -- she is an artist ideally suited to answer essential questions about what makes a story striking, a novel come alive, a writer an artist as well as a craftsman.In The Faith of a Writer, Oates discusses the subjects most important to the narrative craft, touching on topics such as inspiration, memory, self-criticism, and \"the unique power of the unconscious.\" On a more personal note, she speaks of childhood inspirations, offers advice to young writers, and discusses the wildly varying states of mind of a writer at work. Oates also pays homage to those she calls her \"significant predecessors\" and discusses the importance of reading in the life of a writer.Oates claims, \"Inspiration and energy and even genius are rarely enough to make 'art': for prose fiction is also a craft, and craft must be learned, whether by accident or design.\" In fourteen succinct chapters, The Faith of a Writer provides valuable lessons on how language, ideas, and experience are assembled to create art.", "title": "The Faith of a Writer: Life, Craft, Art", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133993.The_Faith_of_a_Writer", "average": 3.81, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1410136890l/133993.jpg", "reviews": 112, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3524.Joyce_Carol_Oates", "name": "Joyce Carol Oates"}], "type": ["Language", "Nonfiction", "Writing", "Autobiography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133993.The_Faith_of_a_Writer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1881234.The_Faith_of_a_Writer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3126744-la-foi-d-un-crivain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12565533-bir-yazar-n-nanc", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5204.We_Were_the_Mulvaneys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15967.The_Falls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15972.The_Gravedigger_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15975.Blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156222.Foxfire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
