Like biologicals all robots were seeking a purpose. Autos and drones were lucky enough to have that built into them. A bot had to find his own way and I\u2019d figured out that functioning for function\u2019s sake was pointless. The real question was finding a directive worth getting scrapped for.\u201dMack Megaton was at the bottom of the sludge heap of Empire City, a city where weird science and toxic chemicals were turning biologicals into all kinds of interesting mutants. His best friend is a talking, book reading addicted Gorilla. The guy that keeps him out of trouble is a rodent biological by the name of Detective Sanchez. Mack is driving a cab and damn lucky to have that job instead of being in pieces at the spare part boneyard. You see, he tried to take over the world. It wasn\u2019t his fault; he was programmed for world domination. He was supposed to bring biologicals to their knees. His creator was obviously brilliant, but something went wrong. \u201dThat defective electronic brain of yours is too prone to sentimentality, concerned with certain illogical motivations. They assumed you were the next step in their evolution, yet they can\u2019t reconcile the apparently randomization of your behavior.\u201dHe is still a cold calculating machine, but he is developing really bad habits that are traits only biologicals have. \u201dOf course they\u2019d known I was lying. That was okay. It was one of the marks of sentience, the ability to distinguish reality from fantasy and still indulge in fantasy. In other words: I lied, therefore I thought.\u201dWhen in Rome, right? He is on his way to full citizenship if he can just stay out of trouble.He can\u2019t do it.Mack decides to try and find a missing family of biologicals and soon finds himself up to his neck screws in trouble. Sam Spade with a spade for a face. Even before he pulls on the pin stripe suit of a private detective, he has Dame with a capital D problems, a four armed mutant trying to \u201dBurn him a new exhaust port,\u201d and a telekinesic arsehole putting a virus into his software. He \u201dhad him by the directives.\u201dAs if it isn\u2019t hard enough just being a bot. I absolutely blew through this book. I was looking for something breezy with a zing, and this fit the bill perfectly. The action is non stop. The robot hardboiled dialogue was fresh and at times had me laughing out loud. I was hoping that A. Lee Martinez had written a follow up book, but as far as I can tell, this is it folks.

Season with small-time thug, one female (cybernetic) psychologist and a handful of broken arms (all from the same thug). Return family to pot, and simmer in secret location while covered for an hour.Bring to boil and add two factions of feuding aliens.Cover and simmer without stirring (may use big guns, a bot with a Brooklynese accent and a sentient gorilla). The dish is finished when the aliens have cooked.Truly a delightful dish. The initial chapters have a great take on the noir detective book, but instead of a jaundiced, rough detective, the lead is an emotion-impaired bot who has been subjected to \"the Freewill Glitch,\" an unpredictable error imbuing robots with ability to override programming. (Don't you just love that free will is called a \"glitch?\") Martinez cleverly hamstrings the virtually indestructible robot by limiting his power through immense electrical costs, demanding careful energy management. Action starts off quickly within the first few pages, allowing development of the robot character as he mulls his interpretations and actions in a thoroughly Sam Spade way. Like the noir detective, the best intentions soon draw him into a path that shakes up his routine but empty life. I worried we were headed into silliness when the gorilla appeared, but truly, Martinez is able to keep the focus on the plot even as his tongue is firmly in cheek. He is able to create the feel of the emotionally drained noir detective in a thoroughly delightful way. Once the noir atmosphere and character development is fully underway, Martinez begins throwing curveballs and dastardly evil villains at our hero, and then it gets truly odd. The bot character ends up being a great anchor through the fantastical, as he negotiates the very real challenges of friendship, ethics and complex decision-making. A fast read, and one I will plan to re-read at some point, as I dream of electric sheep--or at least of Martinez writing a sequel."}, {"userName": "Melki", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki", "userReview": "Damn, some days I wished I'd been made a toaster.Mack Megaton is a robot. He's built for destruction, but spends his days driving a cab. When his neighbor and her family go missing, Mack steps out from behind the wheel, and turns amateur P.I. to find them.The first half of the book moves much like a standard detective novel. There's delightfully crackly dialogue, and some great descriptions of a city in decline:Crime was a dirty public secret in Empire. No one talked about it, and if you listened to the Learned Council, you'd think Empire was a shining utopia of order and decency. True, there were plenty of districts where a citizen could live in complete safety, where police were omnipresent, reliable, and completely effective, where no one ever got mugged or slapped around, or murdered. Then there was the rest of the city.. In a town where technology was supposed to be the answer to all society's ills, there were plenty of ills to go around.Just like Sam Spade, Mack investigates leads and interrogates suspects, albeit suspects who have tentacles and/or extra limbs.Not that I wanted to hurt Ringo. His bones snapped too easily to give me much satisfaction.\"Have it your way. But I don't have much time, and you've got a lot of arms.\"The second half of the book is an action lover's wet dream filled with robot-smashing exploits and Godzilla-like monsters. All of a sudden, Mack's search for one family has led to the discovery of a sinister plot that threatens all of mankind.I started the countdown. Less than one day before people started dying in the thousands.This fun and unusual read is the September selection for the Pulp Fiction Group - https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/....

I don't normally ask for recommendations (my TBR pile will last me a couple of years) , but I was in the mood for something fun, and I picked A Lee Martinez from the comedy shelf of one of my friends here. Lucky me!R. Daneel Oliwav is one of my all time favorite characters in SF, and I read each Robot books by Asimov 3 or 4 times already. Mack Megaton is not that kind of robot though. He's the ultimate killing machine, designed by a mad supervillain to be unstoppable and to enjoy smashing things up and \"squeezing throats until the eyes pop out and the tongues turn purple\" . That is, until he developed the Freewill Glitch and refused to follow orders to kill. Now he is applying for citizenship of the most progressive metropolis on Earth - Empire city - and makes a poor living as a taxi driver.The plot and the dialogue are vintage Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, transplanted to a futuristic setting of chemical and radioactive waste, mutant humans, miniature gadgets, powerful and mysterious ganglords, cynical policemen and blonde bombshells. For all his artificial intelligence detachment and cold analytical power, Mack has really mastered the staccatto delivery of short sentences and the wisecracks of a classic gumshoe detective, so his soon acquired wardrobe of pinstripe suit, fedora and mackintosh is entirely appropriate. His style of solving problems may have more to do with bulldozing through every obstacle than clever deductions, but it proves nevertheless effective. The metal man even gets a romantic interest in a socialite beauty that hides genius level technological talents and a passion for nuts and bolts. The finale was spectacular in an explosive, over the top way: think Godzilla and Mission Impossible directed by Kevin Smith.The novel was a fun ride from start to finish, but it also shows surprising and pleasant depth in the characters and in the debate of artificial intelligence and morality. The writing is more than adequate in the mixing of classic noir with science-fiction. A Lee Martinez is now added to my list of serious humorists like Christopher Moore, Terry Pratchett, Spider Robinson, Jim C. Hines, Douglas Adams etc."}, {"userName": "Tom Mathews", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22063432-tom-mathews", "userReview": "This book makes my brain hurt. It\u2019s a story published in 2008, set in the future but written in a 1940s noir style from the point of view of someone in the 1970s. If that doesn\u2019t make your head spin, you\u2019re not a biological as they say in this world.Our hero is Mack Megaton, a 716 lb. robot, built by an evil criminal mastermind to be an enforcer but now working as a cabbie in Empire, (aka Mutantburg. Robotville. The Big Gray Haze, or The City That Never Functions). When one of his human friends and her children get kidnapped by a four-armed mutant, Mack sets out to track them down and rescue them. What really makes this story is the author\u2019s keen ear for dry noir humor and his tongue-in-cheek style ability to create a world where a beautiful dame like Lucia Napier, could fall for a big, and I mean big, bot like Mack. I also loved how Martinez slipped in the cynical philosophizing that is a quintessential part of all noir fiction. After all, \u201d A bot had to find his own way, and I\u2019d figured out that functioning for function\u2019s sake was pointless. The real question was finding a directive worth getting scrapped for.\u201d4 stars###FYI: On a 5-point scale I assign stars based on my assessment of what the book needs in the way of improvements:*5 Stars \u2013 Nothing at all. If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.*4 Stars \u2013 It could stand for a few tweaks here and there but it\u2019s pretty good as it is.*3 Stars \u2013 A solid C grade. Some serious rewriting would be needed in order for this book to be considered great or memorable.*2 Stars \u2013 This book needs a lot of work. A good start would be to change the plot, the character development, the writing style and the ending. *1 Star - The only thing that would improve this book is a good bonfire."}, {"userName": "\u1d25 Irena \u1d25", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5252054-irena", "userReview": "4.5\n'Name's Mack Megaton. I'm a bot. Or automated citizen, as the Learned Council liked to phrase it.'\n This is a ridiculously entertaining story. You follow a huge bot Mack Megaton on his journey to find his purpose. He is one of a kind bot, though. Built as an almost invincible war machine, he is on probation for a full citizenship in Empire City ('...if your ideal tomorrow was a sprawling, impersonal city with rampant pollution, unchecked mutation, and dangerous and unreliable weird science, then I guess you would be right at home.'). Four more years to go. He even visits a therapist. Mack goes from working as a cab driver ('the biggest ethical dilemma I'd suffered was whether to take a few extra turns to jack up a fare') to something way more serious. He even finds true friends and maybe even a girlfriend. He also learns to trust. This story is funny as hell. Mack and his thoughts or comments on various topics are hilarious.Just a couple of those: \n'If I'd been paranoid, I might've assumed the dispatcher didn't like me. Especially since every shirt he owned had a patch for the Biological Rights League stitched on the pocket.'\n... \n'Messy business, biological existence. All fluids and tissues and passing DNA around in some vain hope that it'd produce something useful.'\n ... \n'There were odd paintings on the wall, full of shapes and colors but all abstract and unrecognisable. Somewhere a six-year-old finger painter was making a fortune.'\n ... \n'In the messy business of biological evolution, defective designs were inevitable. It wasn't much different than robots, except we got to learn our lesson after one or two unsatisfactory prototypes. But biologicals, they just kept churning out the useless ones.'\n Mack and compliments: \n\"I look exquisite, Mack.\" I nodded. \"Like you're going to church. Or maybe a very casual funeral.\"\n Mack and romance: \n'She stepped beside me, and we silently admired the view for seventy seconds.'\n ... \n'One-sixth of a second from confused to idiot.'\n ... \n'I stood beside her. We enjoyed the view for twenty-five seconds.'\n If it weren't for a therapist's unfortunate and distracting name (one mention was too many), this would be perfect."}, {"userName": "j", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2863914-j", "userReview": "\"Look, I wrote a detective novel!\"No one reads those anymore.

Mack is a fun character, his internal conflict between logic and freewill is one ripe with humour and observations of the fallible nature of man, the very nature of his construction leads to some great action sequences of vivid description too.

Technology powers progression, enhances efficiencies, and dilutes the humanist aspects to inner city living. The foundation piece for THE AUTOMATIC DETECTIVE, Empire City has an aura that compliments the protagonist as he smashes his way through villainy towards his objective. The safe return of a kidnapped biological family \u2013 the only beings he can call friends in his two year existence.Mack Megaton, a seven foot robot cab driver with free will (an anomaly of his programming) watches as his neighbours are kidnapped in front of him. A four armed mutant is responsible, having used a teleportation device to whisk the family off into the ether; he vanishes, leaving a handful of angry underworld figures and one determined \u2018bot in his wake. Mack doesn\u2019t take to this sudden disappearance. Ignoring all reasoning, he sets out to locate the missing family at any cost \u2013 even at the expense of Empire City itself.He has a few helpers along the way in the devilish beautiful and dangerously smart Lucia Napier, a 22yro genius, Doctor Mujahid, Mack\u2019s shrink, and Jung, a fellow cabdriver and ape. It\u2019s an odd mix that works very well.

Kept me turning pages.This is the story of Mack Megaton, a sentient robot who was designed for mindless killing and destruction but decides on a much more peaceful way of life after developing \"Freewill\". So the novel opens with his occupation as a cabdriver. Like any sentient being, he wants to know where he came from, who is is and what he is meant to do: in essence he is the soul in the machine, seeking a purpose, like any human does.Along the way, Mack navigates his way through Empire City, which is Martinez's amalgamation of dozens of sci-fi tropes and noir conventions: like mutants, private detectives, secret aliens, a powerful mob boss, a sexy brilliant blonde, all in a dirty, hazy, grimy city. All in all, this is such a cool setting for a sci-fi-noir where murderous robot enemies lurk around every shadowed corner and your best friend is a talking gorilla with a banana complex.Martinez has a way with words and plows through the plot, which is well planned. You have to ignore some of the convenient setups and twists you may see coming - this is the only aspect of the writing that cost this book the fifth star. The shadows of the conspiracy along with our increasing affection for a stand-up bot like Mack really pulls you through the story, waiting to see whats next. The characters are well written and above all, funny. I keep forgetting how good books have memorable characters that always have a humourous side to them even amidst whatever insanity and carnage may be going in. The descriptions of the various mutants will crack you up.The real star of this book is the city itself and the evocations of classic detective tales in the imagery. If you are a fan of old school classics like Double Indemnity, Maltese Falcon, or Chandler books, then the Automatic Detective would be great for you. It gets even better if you are also a fan of science fiction.This is a great weekend read, and hopefully Martinez will follow-up with the further adventures of this giant robot detective."}, {"userName": "Guy Gonzalez", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2594660-guy-gonzalez", "userReview": "This was an unexpected disappointment; it's not a terrible read, but Martinez may have been a little too impressed with the presumed \"cleverness\" of his premise, ending up with a surprisingly derivative and bloodless mash-up of hard-boiled detective, gadget-driven sci-fi, and dystopian futures. While there are a couple of deeper philosophical themes that get touched on, it's very superficial, and the emphasis is on mildly dark humor that often misses the mark.As a result, all of the characters are pretty one-dimensional, including the lead, a robot struggling with coming to terms with his own nascent sentience. The energetic, made-for-Hollywood finale almost pulls it all together, but the maudlin epilogue only serves as a reminder that Martinez never really finds his footing with the story.On the positive side, it's a brisk, mindless read."}, {"userName": "Still", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6752847-still", "userReview": "Great entertainment.Futuristic hard-boiled detective novel with a terrific cast of characters that becomes -near the end- a wonderful giant monster movie comic as drawn by Jack Kirby.Dialogue was superb ...caustic... tough-guy robot with a non-programmed sense of humor cracking wise when the occasion dictates.I had a rockin' good time with this.Highest Recommendation Possible."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24437998-paul", "userReview": "Mack Megaton is a seven foot tall, 300lb robot living in Empire City, working as a cab driver, when his neighbours are kidnapped.

Even a robot can understand why people are into crime fiction. There's a reason detective stories made up such a healthy portion of old pulp novels. While the fairly undemanding structure attracted plenty of hacks, it also brought authors who preferred to spend more of them time on snappy dialogue, good pacing, and colorful characters. While Martinez throws in a great deal of wacky elements, most of them resembling the sort of pulp elements usually seen in science fiction novels. What surprised me most is that almost everything had an organic explanation.If there's one thing that bothers me about bizarro fiction, it's that it usually involves one non-sequiter element stacked on another stacked on another. The Automatic Detective takes the opposite path. Every absurd element has an explanation and a reason for existing within the universe. For something that at first glance seems like pure high-concept whimsy ultimately ends up feeling thoroughly thought through.And it helps that the characters are likable. I could read an entire book about a gorilla taxi driver or Lucia, the brilliant inventor, in this city. Barring one particular villain, almost everyone in this story has a motive and a demeanor that generates interest. If there's a flaw here, and it's a brief on, it's the ultimate villain. He's a bit one-note, and the way they raise the stakes with him at the end too closely resembles the sort of escalation that blockbuster movies have been abusing for about a decade now. But the way the characters deal with that cliche situation actually redeemed it, leaving me rather impressed with the whole thing.It's odd, but I realized that Goodreads has been recommending A. Lee Martinez books to me for years, and I was just put off by the covers. It's easy to assume stuff like this will be the kind of lazy pastiche that comic books are often saturated with.

The ends of his novels are the best parts in my opinion, he does a great job of world building and a great exploration of the story and tells a good story, but undoubtedly I'd have to say that the best parts of all his books are usually the end. This has a great pulpy feel to it, the title detective is a robot that was built for some untold world ending reason by a mad scientist in a world straight out of a 1950s look at the future. There's the flying cars and the 100-foot tall sky scrapers and there's the robot butlers and ray guns and then there is also the darker side of The City Of Tomorrow. The darker underbelly where most of the city lives, where toxic run off has made mutation, if not normal and accepted, at least expected. And the story is good, it just feels sometimes that it's not quite sure if it's trying to be campy or not, that's the feel I got at least. There are moments between the main detective and his talking ape pal that are good, and the scenes with the robot secretary in the detective agency are priceless, totally brilliant comedy, but then there's the harsh reality of one character getting beat to death and another getting his mind erased which are treated in, if not a realistic manner at least a more serious one, which is good since otherwise they'd probably be really creepy scenes.So, overall I liked the book, I thought the characters were well written and well thought out and I think that of all the books by A. Lee Martinez this is the easiest to give a sequel and the one I'd look forward to the most. Wait, no I think I'd rather see a sequel to \"Gil's All Fright Diner\" because that was a really great comedic horror novel which are hard to find, but this is definetly the second book I'd like to see a sequel for. Also, great ending."}, {"userName": "Jeanne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6207706-jeanne", "userReview": "When a bruiser machine robot's, neighbors go missing, Mack Megaton is on the case.

I have waited several days to do this review and I still don't have anything substantive to stay about it. The book is a fast, lighthearted read. It revels in it's own silliness and does an excellent job keeping the tongue firmly in cheek. The story is a twist on the old school noir hardboiled detective stories. But not the books, more like the lighthearted versions that were presented in radio dramas. Think Howard Duff as Sam Spade (google it up, I love Old Time Radio, maybe you would too) and you will have a pretty good idea of the character of the hero, Mack, the not-world-destroying robot. Always ready with a quip and not afraid to get mixed up in things he isn't getting paid for. He complains sometimes, but always ends up helping out the little guy and lets the results land where they may. Mack has a want-to-be partner, and a mysterious beautiful benefactor, and a grumpy but dedicated police sergeant as friends. All of the characters play true to the tropes of the genre and are distinctly voiced. Speaking of voices, the writing does have multitudes of silly jokes like the line that says \"There is an old robot saying: Does Not Compute.\" Nuggets like that were scattered through the book but not so many as to cause silliness overload. All in all I would read another story in this world. I'm not sure how Martinez could do it. Searching his writings it appears that this was a one off, and the way the world is left in the end I suppose that makes sense. He could pull off another Noir story, but he would have a lot of changes and upheavals to account for in another story. Anyways, if he pulls it off, I'll be glad to read it."}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4816194-debra", "userReview": "I have thoroughly enjoyed everything I\u2019ve read by this author.

She likes physically strong guys (given she was sleeping with Ringo, who was an idiot so probably had no other attributes she\u2019d find interesting, other than slumming it). 4. Mack looks good in a suit. And Martinez also makes Mack mention that he\u2019s heard of other technophiles, so it wasn\u2019t like she was the only one. Frankly, I thought their romance was cute. Also, where else would he get his weapons and suit from, given his lack of funds?

The Automatic Detective has stolen my heart as the best scifi/fantasy-detective noir crossover out there. The characters are fun and funny and it is a well-written, enjoyable spoof that carries and twists all of the tropes of the noir genre. Our first-person narrator and PI, Mack Megatron, is an AI-driven robot, which, created to help destroy civilization by a mad genius, unexpectedly developed the \"Freewill Glitch\" and refused to kill. So now he's trying to eke out a living in the big city as a cab driver while waiting out his probation. As the first killer robot to get the Freewill Bug, the city is still waiting to see if he'll snap back to his violent programming. He isn't adjusting too well--he can't really understand how \"biologicals\" think and, despite quite a few sessions with a robot psychiatrist, he still thinks of himself as a machine rather than a person. Isolated and practically friendless, he spends a lot of time on low power, staring blankly at his refrigerator. But suddenly he's forced to snap into action. When one of the few families who is kind to him, his next-door-neighbors, are kidnapped, Mack forswears logic (that requires turning off his \"difference engine\") and sets out to find them. The remaining adventure pulls elements from standard noir--femme fatals, gangsters, and banter abound--and science fiction--almost everyone in the town has some sort of mutation due to vast amounts of pollutants--in a completely original way and from a totally new perspective epitomized by his appearance: a bright red robot wandering around in trenchcoat and fedora. ...And that's all I'm going to post here. \nThe rest of my (rather verbose and quote-filled) review is posted over here at Booklikes.\nWhy? Because I disapprove of GoodReads' new policy of censorship."}, {"userName": "Keith Phillips", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5178360-keith-phillips", "userReview": "The Automatic Detective is exactly the kind of book I\u2019ve been looking for. A real fun mix of Scifi and Sam Spade. Martinez has just the right amount of gritty detective banter and Scifi gadgetry to keep me hanging on every word. What a great ride through the future world that Mack Megaton lives in. A world where Bots and Autos live alongside of human beings, and by law, even apply to become citizens.Mack becomes involved in a mystery that he just won\u2019t let go of when his neighbors are attacked by a thug, and then suddenly disappear. And, following Mack\u2019s cybernetic psychologist\u2019s advice to increase his level of interaction with humans, he goes on a rampage to find and save his friends.Martinez keeps you laughing with the wry humor of Mack, and how he perceives the people and other Bots around him. The characters he creates are natural, and the dialog is great. Some of the names that he\u2019s come up with for things in his world are a bit campy, but it just adds to the whole theme. Also, some of the descriptions are a bit repetitive. Those were minor issues that I hardly even noticed, because I was on a romping fun roller coaster called Mack, and he never let up.I would highly recommend this book for anyone who loves robots, gruff tough detectives, and Scifi.

To me it didn't seem like Mr. Martinez was even trying to be funny, instead he told a story where his own sense of humor effortlessly came through. And what a story.What would you do if you were a relentless killing machine designed by a mad scientist to lead his army and you suddenly became self aware? Apparently you start abandoning your would be master for a job as a taxi driver in a city full of mutants, robots and damsels in distress.
