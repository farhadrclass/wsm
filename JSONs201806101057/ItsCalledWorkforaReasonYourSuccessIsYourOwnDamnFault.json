This book qualifies for that \u2018once-in-a-blue-moon\u2019 phenomenon. Larry Winget with his ferocious teeth of wisdom, his Pitbull persistence and his Irritating persona has managed to do it yet again. This is a book you will either hate or love \u2013 I can assure you nothing in between. If you are an employer you would wish to employ this as your official HR Manual going to the extent of ensuring each and everyone employee of your company reads passages of this book each and everyday \u2013 more like the general assembly and prayers; practiced in many schools as a regular ridiculous ritual. However, if you are an employee, you will want to burn and detest this book with every inch of your life. It would more like the infamous \u2018Book of the Dead\u2019 in Evil Dead. It will haunt them, give them less sleep and ruin their existence forever. I mean can a book get more brutal, blunt and boisterous than this? On a very sincere note, I can tell you without a doubt, this book made me uncomfortable - really uncomfortable, simply because it was the truth \u2013 and nothing but the truth. It just simply strips down the working environment to the simplest forms. But now even with all these praises, I doubt this book will do well. Why?We are a planet where people do not want to get out of their comfort zone. In fact, if I were an employee working for a company, I would hate Larry Winget to my very bones. I mean I love being lazy. I love being paid for no work. I am used to this culture. We as employees feel we are doing this universe a favor by our mere existence. And when you have a self-help guru coming out of nowhere ready to destroy that amazing luxury with hard-work, sweat and blood \u2013 no way in hell!!!Now would I recommend this book?Yes, without a doubt. Simply because these are the gems of wisdom I wish were inculcated into me since the day I was born. They are devoid of all the glamorous garbage motivational speakers sprinkle and techniques which are simply stupid, impractical and purely laughable. When I closed the chapters of this book, I could say, yes, nothing said here is like a \u2018new\u2019 technique or something revolutionary. But I would conclude by saying simply this, if common sense was more common, we would have lesser problems in the world today. Larry Winget is fortunately for us a wild cowboy who is not afraid to shoot from the hip. Sometimes may be we need just that \u2013 A wild cowboy like him to help us make the change.Overall rating \u2013 8 out 10."}, {"userName": "Anthony McDowell", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39994637-anthony-mcdowell", "userReview": "I really wanted to give this book 3 or less stars because the guy comes across as a jerk, but then I look and I have 2 pages of notes front and back, so even though I would never work for someone like him, there is enough information to warrant 5 stars.

PERIOD!Larry Winget, aka The Pitfall of Personal Development\u00ae writes bluntly about owning a business and being an employee. He gut punches, so if you are thin-skinned, don\u2019t bother to pay Amazon the $9.28 (the best money you will ever spend) to discover truths that have made Winget an international speaker \u2014 and rich man!Some topics to topple your old ideas include: No one owes you a living, You don\u2019t have to love your job, Become invaluable, How to absolutely destroy the competition, and Teamwork doesn\u2019t work. Quoting Gregory House, MD, from the Fox TV series House, \u201cThere is no I in TEAM, but if you jumble it all up, there is a ME.\u201d Winget suggests creating Superstar groups of individuals who share a common goal \u2014 getting the job done. And this may mean as the business owner or manager, getting out of your employees way. Winget warns readers in his Preface there may be parts we won\u2019t like and might make us mad. He doesn\u2019t give a whiff. Not his problem. Get over it and read the book or put it down. He will tell you of the thousands of business books he has read, most have been a \u201ctotal waste of time.\u201d He pretty much says the same about motivational books and speakers. His philosophy through experience is that: (1) People motivate themselves and, (2) Everyone does what they want to do, when they want to do it, and not until then. That said, he advises to unload dead-weight employees ASAP; that it is cheaper to train employees, that, \u201c... stupid employees are more expensive.\u201d And, \u201cIt's cheaper to fight bad employees when they are on the outside of the company.\u201d Winget\u2019s advice to be the invaluable employee, on customer service, on respect and ethics; how not to put up with foolishness from employees, employers, companies, and in general life, is forthright and for this reader, \u201cRight On, Bro!\u201dBottom line for Winget is Respect, Honesty, Ethics, taking Responsibility for our decisions and actions and that, \u201cYour Success Is Your Own Damn Fault.\u201dRead it and love it garnering the simple basic truths honed by our grandparents, practiced by our parents, put-down in the 60s, forgotten by the New Millenniums, and unknown by every complainer jamming up the Web these days. Winget says it like it is and I for one find his take \u201crefreshing.\u201dRecommended for business owners, employees and anyone that can handle gut-punching truths.

There were a few things I could identify with personally. There were also a lot of coworkers that I identified right away as the lazy bums they are that, if they worked for Larry, would have been long gone by now. A lot of this book is common sense, or at least readers may think it is common sense until they start reading. I say the readers may think it is common sense because if everybody actually embraced at least some of the ideas Mr. Winget is presenting the workplace would be a much better place-- we would have better customer service; we would have workplaces where workers put forth their best work; we would have bosses that would not micromanage and would know to get out of the way so those of us who actually work can get on with work. Mr. Winget has a very blunt and straight style. To some it may seem like yelling on the page, but tell it like it is he does. There is no reason to accept poor customer service. There is no real reason to tolerate shoddy work in the workplace. The fact is these things would go away if more people would stop tolerating them. It's like I say: you support what you tolerate. Now, Winget does not say you have to be rude in order to demand change, but you do have to stand up and demand change--change in yourself and change in others. If you tolerate the mediocrity, you are just supporting it, and in the end, you would be as bad as those mediocre people. It's a pretty simple idea. Another simple idea: you should do the work you get paid for. It's a simple concept. You take the job, and you agree to do it for the pay the boss agrees to give you. Anything else--liking your coworkers, whether the environment is pleasant, so on-- is extra. Do your job. Don't like it, leave, but it does help if you do like the job. Winget covers leadership and management, the workplace, advice for workers and for bosses, how sell better (and it is not just selling a product. You sell yourself every day), and customer service. Some of his stories will make you smile, and others will make you cringe. I do think that readers, whether they agree or disagree, whether they like his somewhat abrasive style or not, will gain something from this book. The sad thing is that I know many managers and workers will not read this book. I am not a big reader of \"business\" or \"self-help\" books, but this is definitely one to read and to reread when you need a little more inspiration. In some cases, you may want to grab the book and smack a certain someone over the head with it, then tell him to read it. On an additional note, even though Mr. Winget's work is focused mostly on the business world, and a big part of it deals with sales (probably because Mr. Winget does have ample sales experience), there are lessons here for librarians and librarianship. True, we do not exist to generate a profit, but we still deal with things like customer service, our reputations and work ethic, and for those of us in the trenches, we do have to deal with the occasional less than ideal boss or coworker. And in times when libraries are suffering cutbacks, we need more than ever to be selling our products if we are to prove our value and survive. That is not just the business world. That is something we can learn and act upon as well. Overall, this is a book I would like to place in more people's hands, and it is a book I think will provide benefit to librarians who read it, discuss it, then act on it."}, {"userName": "Anthony Deluca", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18890669-anthony-deluca", "userReview": "It\u2019s Called Work for a ReasonBy: Larry WingetCopyright 2007Reviewed February 2008.This book is very straightforward, useful, easy, and even entertaining. Larry Winget gives this expectation up front and delivers throughout the book. The background for the book is the experiences and theories of the author. The motivation is very subjective, yet hit a common vein with me, and I would expect would do the same with others. I would not consider this book a solo tool for becoming a better manager, employee, or person. It is, however, a must-read from a base-line attitude aspect.The title of the book is perfect. Larry defines what work is and should be, and how individuals approach work, both correctly and incorrectly. Early in the book Larry points out a common fact that working folks often forget: \u201cNo one owes you a living.\u201d Many people become stagnant in a position or company after being there for a long time. Many develop an attitude that they are entitled to compensation form an organization simply because they are employed there, not because they actually generate revenue for the company. Folks need to remember that unless they are generating more money for the company than the company is paying them, technically they are not fulfilling the job for which the organization is paying them. To me, this part of the book is the most enlightening and valuable. Larry provides many comedic anecdotes from viewpoints both within and outside of a business. Must you love your job? Larry spends a fair amount of time discussing the facts about weather you really must or even can love your job and how to deal with that. Friendships and other relationships at work, ethics, and the bottom line to keep yourself valuable, selling, are some of the other topics Larry highlights in the middle to latter section of the book. In the end, Larry offers two lists which provide a good overview to remember lessons learned in the book: \u201cLarry\u2019s Dirty Dozen Employee Handbook,\u201d and \u201cLarry\u2019s Dirty Dozen Employer Handbook.\u201d I consider this book as a great tool to give yourself and members of your organization a baseline attitude check. As I stated earlier, I would not have this be a solo tool for self-improvement. While it points out many valuable lessons in an extremely pragmatic fashion, it may tend to leave one bitter as it points out the very pathetic nature of many of the folks, both leaders and followers, in our work force today. This book followed by the Seven Habits of Highly Effective people would be a great one two punch for self-improvement!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Licata", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7838503-elizabeth-licata", "userReview": "It\u2019s Called Work for a Reason! By Larry Winget5/7 stars\tI will admit that I have avoided reading this book for years. Not because I dislike work or am not dedicated to doing a good job. Rather, I had problems with the cover. The front cover of the book is emblazoned with gold lettering and features a man wearing sunglasses, flowered shirt, gaudy rings, and chartreuse boots. First impressions are everything. My first impression was: how could someone who dresses like that teach? I am happy to say that I was wrong. Winget proved to be more insightful than I gave him credit for.There were a few main takeaways from this book for me. 1.\tYour job is to get results, not work hard. While I had been putting this principle into action prior to this, it was much more haphazard than I would have liked. No one to date had put it quite this way, and I found it a good shift in perspective.2.\tSuccess is simple, but not easy. Success comes from hard work, being focused and delivering what you say you will. I had come to suspect this for myself. I\u2019ve never heard a success story that went \u201cI got an opportunity and thought, I\u2019m just going to wing this one.\u201d3.\tEthics is never a sometimes thing. I don\u2019t think I really need to go into this more than that.Stylistically, It\u2019s Called Work is highly conversational. I don\u2019t mind this in general, but I DO mind the excessive use of exclamation points. To quote Greg Proops, \u201cI believe that exclamation points should never, if ever be used.There was one point which I strongly disagreed with Winget on, and that was the issue of harassment in the workplace. His general policy is \u201csuck it up if no one is actively groping you or threating your job\u201d. This is a na\u00efve way to look at how women are treated in the workplace in general, and I cannot condone that part of the book.All in all, the book is worth your time."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/512845-peter", "userReview": "I have to admit, I was biased at first. I thought this book, like many other popular personal finance books would fit into one of two categories:1: Complete and total BS, the author wrote the book for one reason, *his* personal finances.2: Another motivational speaker who it tells it like it is.While the book seemed to have inklings of both of the above abhorrent qualities, it was unique and interesting in it's own right. Larry describes himself as 'the world's only irratational speaker' (trademark) and gives it to you straight, that's the BS part :) I don't really care about that. But those dings aside, the book is interesting and insightful, I've since applied some of the concepts to my working career and become more aware of the traits that my coworkers poses (I'm not talking about the good ones...).Larry seems to be an every-man man, so he's easy to relate to (unless you *were* born with a silver spoon) the subject is interesting and the book is quick to read.It's probably not on my top 10, but definitely still on my 'must reads' for people interested in business, and more importantly successful business."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74862-michelle", "userReview": "The tone of this book is much different from almost all other professional development/team building/leadership books.

Some authors of business books stroke your ego by reinforcing information you already know. Others give you detailed statistical analysis of the economy, or buying trends, encouraging you to get lost in the pages of boredom until you have no idea what the book is even about. Some authors exploit the hottest buzzword and beat it to death, without giving you any real idea how to do what they suggest must be done. Some say that all you have to do is love your job in order to be successful at it. The worst of the lot tell cute little parables through inane dialogues with messages so simple and trite that we should all be insulted. In IT\u2019S CALLED WORK FOR A REASON, Larry Winget tells the unvarnished truth about what it takes to be successful:  NOT business jargon (Forget branding! Forget thinking outside the box\u2014you\u2019re not in a box!) NOT parables (Who cares who moved your cheese\u2014what cheese?)  NOT praise sandwiches (talk about cheese!)  Just the one key ingredient to success in business: Work! Are you frustrated with a lack of results at work? Have you hit a wall? Are you uninspired, stuck in a rut, feeling underappreciated? Well, good news: your success is not up to your boss, your manager, your employees, or the economy. It\u2019s up to YOU. Business is never bad, people are just bad at being in business. If that makes you mad, this book is for you. Larry Winget hacks through the bad advice given in most business books, explaining why *\tTeamwork doesn\u2019t work *\tWe are all stealing from our companies and ourselves *\tSuccess is simple *\tResults are everything *\tYou don\u2019t have to love your job (but it helps!)  You will be surprised, you will laugh, and you will discover motivation you never knew you had. Let Larry Winget shock you out of your comfort zone, and into a whole new league.", "title": "It's Called Work for a Reason!: Your Success Is Your Own Damn Fault", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/141062.It_s_Called_Work_for_a_Reason_", "average": 4.07, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1438622730l/141062.jpg", "reviews": 79, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/34413.Larry_Winget", "name": "Larry Winget"}], "type": ["Business", "Nonfiction", "Self Help", "Economics", "Humor"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/141062.It_s_Called_Work_for_a_Reason_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2649451-it-s-called-work-for-a-reason", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7698685-it-s-called-work-for-a-reason", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61150.Shut_Up_Stop_Whining_and_Get_a_Life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1645726.You_re_Broke_Because_You_Want_to_Be", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4188051-people-are-idiots-and-i-can-prove-it", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17674992-grow-a-pair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7381392-your-kids-are-your-own-fault", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205082-everything-is-horrible-and-wonderful", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
