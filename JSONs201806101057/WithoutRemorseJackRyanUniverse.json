It wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't as good as I'd hoped, given Clancy's success. First gripe: There were FAR too many side plots, which I know where there in some attempt to round out the narrative, to show how things happen, but it just got distracting. Stupidly so at times. Second gripe: What the hell was Clancy thinking when he started calling people by different names? Sometimes a character is referred to by his first name, sometimes by his last, sometimes by his title. Note to writers: In exposition, call characters by ONE NAME. It's irritating as hell to have a character introduced and then have to trace him back because in one pages you've got two or even three names for the same person. Last gripe (not quite but almost a SPOILER): Kelly was pretty frickin' dumb to get caught unaware in the beginning. What an idiot. I almost stopped reading there.I'm giving Rainbox Six a try, but I doubt I'll go past that..."}, {"userName": "Tim Greaton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5412431-tim-greaton", "userReview": "So bad yet so good...Tom Clancy has long been a hit and miss author for me. I should say that a lot of it has to do with his incredibly detailed and dense descriptions of everything military. He earns a lot of kudos for his intense knowledge of his subject matter and his ability to base his fiction in frighteningly realistic circumstances, but there are times when I just want to get on with the story and not learn about a firing pin and its historical significance to military maneuvers in the east pacific along the way. However, Without Remorse is a book so deeply drenched in character building that it swallowed me up with sympathy, empathy, and then a deep personal need to see Mr. Clark succeed in finding revenge and yes \"justice\" for the many wrongs that had been done to him and his. I, like many of us, had met Mr. Clark in other Clancy tales, where he was a cool and efficient military liaison to our government. But within the pages of Without Remorse, Tom Clancy brings him to life. Mr. Clark is soon revealed as a man with a history filled with flaws that maybe forgivable but are nonetheless frightening. Back when he was called Kelly, Mr. Clark endured the loss of a wife and then another woman who was very important to him. Unfortunately for the men responsible, he wasn't prepared to accept that second loss. A man with hard-earned military skills, Kelly/Clark moves, no sweeps, through this story and leaves us with a sense of nobility as he deals with some of the most revolting segments of our society. Is vigilante justice right? And can a man with the skills earned through U.S. military Special Forces actually beat law enforcement? The answers to those questions are sure to surprise you. But please don't assume this novel is about revenge, because it's not. It's really about how a man changes in the face of severe personal adversity, and about how even the most righteous of causes can somehow get all twisted up. All these big issues aside, rest assured Mr. Clark is a man worth meeting and spending time with. His story isn't an easy one, but I, for one, would be pleased to learn that men like him are standing watch all around our world today. from \"Maine's Author Author\"(TM) Tim Greaton"}, {"userName": "Igor Ljubuncic", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10471943-igor-ljubuncic", "userReview": "This book is good for three reasons. One, it's not a Jack Ryan story. It tells us how John Clark came into being, who he is and what he is, and the plot actually happens roughly 15-20 years before the main series.Two, Vietnam, so it's low tech and gritty Ramboism.Three, Tom Clancy normally wrote Puritan Republican-voting cardboard emotions for his characters with the full knowledge that they would be portrayed in the cinema, so it must look good. But here, he went the distance with John and actually gave him something of a semblance of a real personality, and it's one of his more engaging works.All combined, it's a very decent, classic thriller, and you will like for a bunch of reasons, especially since John is sort of an anti-hero, and there are several unique, old era elements in the book, which make for a very refreshing departure from Tom's highly dense and detailed military flavored writing.Now, we limerick:John met a girl with no name,After her death, a vigilante became,Vengeance he sought,In Vietnam fought,Delta Force operatives get no fame.Cheers,Igor"}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17042835-tim", "userReview": "The beginning was slow and mildly interesting.

Having seen Hunt For Red October/Patriot Games/Sum of all Fears at the movies and finding them to be good movies I thought I'd try out the actual books. Hating to start in the middle of a series I decided if I'm going to read a Tom Clancy book I might as well start at the beginning and enjoy them all (assuming they're any good) and boy am I glad I did!This book isn't what I expected - I thought it'ld be more action, shooting and explosions with little substance, but no there's a great deal of substance to this book and the writing style is easy to read yet very detailed and atmospheric. (There's action, shooting and explosions, but not mindlessly).The story at a basic level is one of revenge, a man (John Kelly) who has previously lost his wife meets a young lady (Pam), it turns out Pam has been the victim of abuse, John Kelly falls in love with Pam and helping her recover and in doing so opens his heart for the first time since the death of his wife and is crushed when Pam is then murdered by her past abusers. Enter John-the-serial-killer who seeks revenge on those who took his Pam from him. Amongst this there are a couple of other sub plots as well as the second main thrust of the story line which is John Kelly returning to Vietnam as well as being recruited by the CIA.It really was quite the moving story and you couldn't help but sympathise with John Kelly even as he killed again and again."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "This is our first meeting with John Clark...if you follow Clansy's novels that tells you the back ground on this one.This novel is quite a bit more violent than some of Clancy's other works (that's saying something I know) but that will hold true for the Clark centered novels in the series.You get fast moving adventure with slightly less of the political twists you get when the books are about \"Jack\".

It rounded out to be a so-so thriller overall.Audiobook: Much like the other Clancy books he's narrated, Michael Prichard does a fine job, but nothing spectacular. He speaks clearly and with good volume. He doesn't add anything extra to the story nor does he detract from it. Audio is a decent option here.\nFull Review\nThis book is largely split into two parts: Military/CIA thriller, and domestic vigilante action crime drama. I much preferred the former to the latter.The beginning of this book was a drag. I guess it was meant to give you sympathy to John Clark's one-man crusade, but I mostly just found it soured me on the whole subplot. I guess it's important to explaining how John Kelly became John Clark, but if anything it made me less interested in his origin story.The parts of this book I enjoyed most were the parts where John was acting as John Clark. The planning and execution of a dangerous and daring mission where his expertise is the make or break point for success or failure. That was what I picked this book up for.Part of my issue may be the timing. I had just finished another Tom Clancy book not that long ago, and probably wasn't ready for a second so soon, but my hold came in from the library so I decided to go ahead anyways.At this point, I'll be taking a break from Clancy for awhile.

He's done his service, and well, and is now working as an underwater demolitions expert. Of course, that all changes when his pregnant wife is accidentally killed. Several months pass. Then on a wimhe picks up a female hitch hiker while he is on the way to his boat. (he lives on an island somewhere off the coast of MD that used to be a military site).The hitch hiker has a horrendous past, she's running from some very bad people, and is addicted to drugs. That is where the book really takes off.***Spoiler Alert***The good...-Kelly is a very likable character. He's tough, but the very same things that make him so resiliant also show his humanity. -The love story between Kelly and Pam is very sweet. There is something touching about the two of them finding each other.The bad...-Pam dies. That sucked. I like happy endings. -The way that Pam dies. The retelling of that tale is just to brutal. I actually debated about giving the book a lower rating because I found it disturbing. But then I argued with myself that if it was giving my nightmares, I guess it was effective. -The cross story about the POW's and how they were off the books was interesting, but I think it could have been done quicker. It was a lot of subplot for what I felt was little return. Kelly needed the out at the end, but I don't think the story needed that much detail to make it happen.-In the end, Henry got it too quick. He should have been the one in the high pressure chamber.A very good read, and the overall happy ending with Nurse O'Toole in the end was a nice touch. I liked that Kelly was at peace by the last page. And while Jack Ryan is just barely in this book, it is considered the first in the series.

Don't gang rape and murder someone's girlfriend if you're not able to defend yourself against her angry, psycho, highly trained military boyfriend, John Clark. Especially gruesome because the torturee was kept alive for days after being placed in a decompression chamber turned up and up and up and up, until one by one his ear drums burst, his eyes popped out, his joints explode one at a time, etc. I think his vocal cords were also destroyed so he couldn't yell for help and nobody could hear him if he could.

This was my first Tom Clancy book and won't be the last, I read this book because my friends have talked about how great of a writer Tom Clancy is. So I took a look at some of his books. And to be honest at first I did judge his books by their covers, because there was always some sort of gun or weapon on the cover. So I figured he would be the Michael Bay of literature, all explosions, a weak plot, and characters without any depth. But I was pleasantly surprised!

This is only my second Tom Clancy book. I read \"Executive Orders\" the year it came out...so a while back. I decided to start with book 1 in the Jack Ryan series (yes, he's mentioned briefly in this book).This book focuses on the early life of John Kelly (John Clark), a legend in the Jack Ryan series. I remember his character in the movie \"Clear and Present Danger\", played by William Dafoe. Let me be clear. This was a good book. I gave it 2 stars, almost 3. The reason being is the book started off on such an atrocious note that I could hardly get past the first 7 chapters. It was that bad. The story starts off with John Kelly (ex Vietnam Navy SEAL), driving to his boat when he picks up a random, yes random, chick hitchhiking on the side of the road. Not only is this girl young and fairly attractive, she's also a completely drug dependent prostitute. Within 24 hours these two are in complete love with each other and have a life planned ahead. Now, in the real world, this is nonsense. This Pam Madden girl would have robbed him blind on the first night and been right back on the street doing dope and turning tricks...that's real world folks. Quickly, Kelly finds a doctor and his wife that nurse Pam off the drugs and get her cleaned up and presentable and all looks to be hunky dory for our guy Kelly and his new love, Pam. Mind you, Kelly is also 6 months removed from his pregnant wife Tisha having been killed in an auto accident. Also killed was their unborn baby. Geeez, what luck. Almost put the book down at this point. Just not believable in the real world. Then the book got better.After Pam is cleaned up, Kelly gets the bright idea (or not so bright, especially for a SEAL) to take Pam back to the city and scope out who the guys are that hooked her onto drugs and basically held her as a sex slave. While driving through the \"hood\", Pam is spotted by one of the main players on the street. This is significant because already another girl wound up dead when she tried to escape. The drug dealers can't afford to let any girl escape because they have been witnesses to various crimes, including murder. A car pursuit enues and Kelly appears to get away but he makes a fatal mistake. Pam is taken from the car and later found brutally murdered (another good grief) and Kelly (a former SEAL mind you), is shot by a low level street thug with a shotgun.Kelly survives the assault and is treated by the same doctor, Dr. Rosen, who helped with Pam. Also a nurse named Sandy O'Toole makes her appearance (and later marries Kelly....what's with this guy and instant love?????) and also helps Kelly. Kelly at this point has nothing but revenge on his mind and gets to work, going on a mass killing spree in the city, ridding the streets of money, drugs, and drug dealers. At the same time, the story gets a little confusing with 2-3 other sub stories going on (more like 4-5). The Vietnam War and a rescue attempt of POWS, a POW/Russian colonel relationship (not sexual mind you) in the camp, a crooked cop in with the drug dealers, a leak in the NSA (or whatever the equivalent was in the late '60s)that blows the rescue operation, ect, ect, ect. I'm not going to go into details into these parts of the story. Clancy leaves the reader to decide on the moral conundrum that Kelly presents. Is he right to kill truly bad people??? Is it any different then war??? Is revenge ok given the end result is good?? Clancy never answers the question, although the book clearly leans to approval of the hero. The book is very brutal. Clancy pulls no punches in the descriptions of abuse for the girls involved in the drug ring. Vivid descriptions of the torture Kelly puts some of these guys through even made me nauseous, which isn't easy to do.I liked the book. It's a classic example of revenge along the lines of \"Man on Fire\", \"Taken\", ect. I wanted to give it 3 or 4 stars and in fact the last 3/4 of the book are worthy of that...but again, the first 7 chapters almost ruined the whole story. Looking forward to Patriot Games next."}, {"userName": "Kevin Murphy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2565406-kevin-murphy", "userReview": "Ah, yes. Now I remember. I remember why I so enjoyed Tom Clancy in high school/college. This book has motivated me to re-read the entire Ryanverse set of novels (save for \"Red Rabbit,\" which I just finished and was less than impressed with). I tried 4 or 5 times over the last 15 years to read this book, but never got into it. The reasons elude me. Perhaps it was a matter of maturity, but it's hard to say. Either way, a top notch thriller. Had a hard time going to sleep at reasonable times during this literary endeavor. Gotta love John Clark (Kelly); the man behind the myth. My only issues revolved around his quick-to-fall-in-love mentality, and the way every single character would put \"like\" at the end of sentences (bringing out Clancy's - at the time - lack of familiarity with dialogue)... i.e. - \"He walked around really quiet, like.\" Nobody talks like that, and if they do, not every character in a book would use the same vernacular.

One of the most intriguing mysteries (where you know who the bad guy, or was he a good guy, is) I've read in a long time. Not a formular writer. My only criticism is that it was at times difficult to immediate tell when gears were shifted going from one scene (e.g. the drug lords) to another (i.e. the war).

Jack's father Emmett is a detective that plays an integral role throughout this story. There's a brief scene with a very young Jack who is about to enlist in the Marines.I had forgotten how intricate the plots are in Tom Clancy's books. This book opens with several sub-plots; Kelly's wife's death; the capture of an airline Colonel in Vietnam; the rapidly growing drug trafficking along the east coast. These three sub-plots branch off as the events unfold and several players are added, many of which play prominent roles in other books in this series. Each event leads up to the resolution of the sub-plots and to the man that John Kelly becomes. Clancy uses Kelly's own reflection as he's about to embark on a mission that he understands but wishes they'd asked someone else that sums up the man --- \"He remembered high school English classes, as he drove south, now on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. Aristotle\u2019s rules of tragedy. The hero had to have a tragic flaw, had to drive himself to his fate.

Clancy departs from Jack Ryan being the center of attention, and focuses on a minor character--but a good one--from his other books, which we have never known well, but would like to. In this book, we get to know John Kelly (alias Mr. Clark), better than at times, we would like. Clancy takes us on a raw and powerful journey through Mr. Clark's life, with every dramatic twist and turn, showing us what it takes to create such a cold-blooded and effective killer. At times, this story was such a departure from the other carefully constructed worlds Clancy has created, I would wonder how it would tie back in with the character we know...but he does. Sometimes going into someone's past can be annoying or confusing, but it is used very effectively in building the character of Mr. Clark.
