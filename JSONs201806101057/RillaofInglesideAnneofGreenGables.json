While it's wonderful to see characters evolve into adulthood and have a next generation come to life, the real strength of this book is it's window into the homeland society of rural Maritime Canada during the first World War. It's one of few documentations (even if the characters are fictional) of what women were doing at home during the war, and this setting breathes new life into the end of the series. The setting also allows Montgomery to challenge readers with darker elements that are often present but less overt in other books. Rilla, Anne's youngest daughter, is a wonderful, spirited character and one of my favorites. In general, Montgomery's work is constantly under-estimated, and the way the books are marketed doesn't help (the flowery script, the swoony illustrations). There are many layers at work in her stories, and some pioneering feminist concepts tucked in between the deep appreciation of nature, the commentary on the stuffy contemporary society of her day, and the delightful, well-drawn characters."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2701485-lindsay", "userReview": "This is the book that finally severed my relationship with Kevin Sullivan. When Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story premiered in the early 2000s, I was shocked to discover that Anne and Gilbert were suddenly time warped to WWI. That's wrong. On so many levels.WWI wasn't Anne's war, it was Rilla's, and Ken's, and Walter's, and that damn dog who turns me into a gushy mess every freaking time I read the last chapter. Rilla -- the youngest child of Anne and Gilbert -- is fifteen (see what I mean about the time warp??) and desperately in love with the boy next door. When the world around her crashes and she's forced to grow up quickly, her journey is just as enjoyable as her mother's was in the first three books. The difference is, this is a mature kind of love. Though I devoured the entire series as a seven year old,  Rilla of Ingleside  is the one that I've worn through with repeated readings as an adult. Simply put, it's perfection.The fact that Kevin Sullivan clearly ignored the fact that this book was written at all is frustrating and, to a reader who considers this book one of the reasons she became a romance writer, downright cruel."}, {"userName": "Duane", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24389390-duane", "userReview": "I have now read all eight books in the Anne of Green Gables series. Eight books that were an absolute pleasure to read. I like this one almost as much as the 1st one. It's the story of Anne's daughter Rilla, but it is set with the backdrop of World War I which has a huge influence on Anne's family. This story has a more serious tone than the other books but it is a fitting conclusion to a wonderful story."}, {"userName": "Naomi Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40096835-naomi-sarah", "userReview": "This book.  THIS BOOK.  Seriously, I have no words. I can only sit here and cry and sob like a baby. It was  that  good. Every reread makes me quiet in stunned awe; ever reread makes me tremble in the emotion, the beauty, the amazingness. This book is out-of-this-world amazing. I've decided it's my favourite novel.(Um, this review contains a spoiler of a certain death. But you may want to be prepared for the death, so carry on reading.)Soooooo.1. I cried more than ten times. I'm sure of it.2. I laughed (really laughed - not just the tsk-laugh) three times.3. I REALLY cried. Like, tears dripped on my pyjama top. :,-(4. AZRIOFZQEOZGUHUJFHUJIHDSUIDSGHUHUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!Right, so judged from those four points, I obviously OBVIOUSLY think this book is  AMAZING AND UTTERLY COMPLETELY EMOTIONAL AND AMAZING AND HEART-MOVING. Oh, this booooook. It's DEFINITELY one of my favouritest-of-favouritest books ever. It's definitely the book that gives me the most feels, it's MOST DEFINITELY the book that makes me cry the most. Goodness, I don't know WHAT this book DOES to me - but I just can.not. stop crying! Maybe it's because it's a re-read - I know what's going to happen to a certain favourite character of mine, and therefore in every paragraph where he's in I automatically start crying because I know that he's going to die. (I JUST LOVE HIM TOO MUCH I CAN'T BEAR IT.)THIS BOOK.  Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. But let me make a list or two. :-) Sort out my many thoughts and feels in a more organised manner, you know. It must be done, even when in utter tears and states such as mine currently. What I ABSOLUTELY LOVE ABOUT THIS BOOK: 1. I own it. Hahahahahahahaha.2. The fact that it gives me SO. MUCH. SORROW. That means it's amazing; right? That means it's written in the most amazing way ever, right? UGH. THIS BOOK MAKES ME CRY. I tell you again,  TISSUES ARE NEEDED.  (Seriously, the Amazon guys should add a tissue or two whenever they ship a copy of 'Rilla of Ingleside' somewhere. I might write a letter and tell them.)3.  Kenneth.  He's so HAAAAAANDSOME. Plus, he's also pretty cool. AND I LOVE HIS SCAR IN THE END. I'm just in love with his scar. :-) And ohhh, it's so MEAN of Montgomery to stop the book so soon, just when Ken and Rilla are FINALLY reunited. I NEED ONE MORE CHAPTER. Please. I want to see them married. Ugh, Kenneth, you're adorable.4.  WALTER.  I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER CRIED MORE FOR A FICTIONAL CHARACTER. I'M MADLY IN LOVE WITH HIM. SERIOUSLY. I WISH I WASN'T SERIOUS. (Also, he's the fictional character I've devoted the most capital letters to, I think. Hah.) He's probably my favourite fictional character of  all  time and he's a hero and I love him to bits.5.  Una. I basically AM Una.  We're in the same Walter-position, anyway. I feel SO sorry for her, because she has a sad and lonely ending. Oh, and her lovely whistful dark blue eyes!  AND WHEN WALTER GIVES HER A 'COMRADE-Y KISS' AT THE RAILWAY.  I bawwwled. (surprise, surprise.)6. Jem and Faith. Basically love them.7. The DANCE. And the mooonlight scenes.8. AND AND AND  KEN AND RILLA'S KISS.  I've gotta admit I've reread that bit a shamefull amount of times. It's funny how Montgomery makes something SO romantic and adorable and swoony from such an unromantic setting. (Susan was standing in the same room, for Pete's sake. Haha.)9. Susan was funny - I have to admit she's not my favourite character, though. But she's fun and the book wouldn't be the same without her.10. The BABY. OH I LOVE JIMS. Enough said, maybe.11.  WALTERS LETTER.  (Be warned. Capital letters. (I really am unashamed of using Caps Lock in my Goodreads reviews, aren't I?)) OH MY GOODNESS EOQfjzQGINDIFH\u00a8DH. WALTERS LETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!That's the part where I cry the most. Just saying. Especially when Rilla then gives it to Una. (I can't tell you how much a cry at this point.) OH UNA. I WISH YOU AND WALTER COULD MARRY.12. EVERYTHING.13. Rilla.  GAWSH.  She annoys me a little in the beginning, but as the book progesses....  What a great girl.  I can relate to her so much it kind of hurts. I love how she has flaws, and never is \"perfect.\"14.  WALTER. 15. Jeeeeeem.16.  Dog Monday. DOG MONDAY.  I am literally the least-doggiest person in the WORLD. But  my goodness.  My eyes are waterworks when Dog Monday and Jem are finally reunited. WATERWORKS. I tell ya.17. SHIRLEY. I love that boy.18.  WALTER IS MY FAVOURITE THOUGH AND OF COURSE HE DIES. *cries for three hours* What I didn't like: 1. Rilla annoys me in the beginning of the book. Also, it makes me  angry  how unlovable she is towards dear little Jim in the beginning.2. I find the first chapter, about the cats, dead boring. Soary.3. Also the bits about politics and what-happens-in-the-war are boring. Really.4. THERE IS NO MOVIE. (I might write a script and send it to BBC or something. No really. I am considering this very seriously. A Christmas holiday project?)BUT PLEASE.READ THIS BOOK. IT'S AMAZING.  And that's honestly, sincerely not an exaggeration. I cannot even tell you - this review does not do justice at all. (And it's kind of ruined my Christmas. I'm going to cry all week.)"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/185664-kelly", "userReview": "This is probably my favorite of the Anne books.

Montgomery published. Somehow along the way, an abridged edition appeared through an Amercian publishing house and that abridged version became the standard (accidentally). As a result, I was curious to discover what jewels of Rilla of Ingleside I was missing. While, I feel self-satisfied in the knowledge of having truly read the complete version of RofI, I don't think I would have noticed any difference between my 1980s edition and the new complete version had I not known. Nevertheless, my journey with the Blythe family through WWI was still provoking, tearful, and delightful all over again. In addition, the newly discovered and restored version(edited by Benjamin Lefebvre and Andrea McKenzie) includes: a glossary, a brief history of WWI and two war poems written by L.M. Montgomery. Therefore, I do recommend that any L.M. Montgomery fan (or anyone who has not already discovered Rilla of Ingleside) pick up a copy of this edition immediately.

This book will never grow old for me. It's a dear friend :)***This is the most amazing, sweetest, heart-wrenching books I've read in my life. I've read it at least ten times (maybe more ;)) and I love it every. single. time.This is a book that can be enjoyable read on its on, but it is ever so much better if you've read the whole series. So read the whole series...and then just sigh with happiness, true bliss, when you read this one.Why I LOVE about this book:-The characters are whimsical and delightful. L.M. Montgomery explains simple ordinary things as hilarious and interesting. She makes you smile and cry with one sentence.-Susan. She is my all time favorite character. Her mockery of the war and the leaders of the country made me smirk more than once. And then when daylight savings time is put into place she is adamant that it is against the Bible. Her love of Shirley, her devotion to the Blythes, and her stern ways make you simply want to hug her. She's so down to earth.-I'm afraid all my loves are the characters themselves. Walter Blythe should get his own review. He makes me want to soooob....He is amazing. My heart wrenched for him. He hated the war, but duty came first. Duty because it was the right thing to do. Sigghhh.-Kenneth Ford. Such a handsome fellow...and I especially like him because he is the son of the Ford's (whose love story is introduced in Anne's House of Dreams). I love how he calls Rilla, Rilla-my-Rilla. On this same note...I LOVE the scene when he has came to tell Rilla goodbye and Susan starts chatting about when she spanked him. I just died!!! And he is so serious and grim, but wants to burst out laughing the whole time.-And Rilla. I love how she learns to do her part for the war effort. And how she learns to love the little baby from the soup tureen. Yes, she is a character full of mistakes, but oh so dear. And her lisp. Hehe. I LOVE the last two sentences in the book and I quote them all the time (oh the calamity of lisping at the worst of times!!):\"Is it Rilla-my-Rilla?\"\"Yeth,\" said Rilla.-The setting. I have fallen in love with the World War 1 setting (probably because of this book)! Instead of showing the men fighting, it focuses on those left at home.Other thoughts:-There are a couple swear words, but not more than a half of dozen. The middle is a little slow with all the fellows gone, but not enough to bore me, especially when Susan's around ;) There is a brief kiss in the middle of the book, but it's sweet and not detailed at all. One thing I would have liked is for the book to never end.I heartily LOVE LOVE LOVE this book. I review does not do justice to it. Go grab a copy and then fall in love with it too ;)"}, {"userName": "Darcy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3380448-darcy", "userReview": "It was with great relief and disappointment that I finally closed the last volume of the Anne series. I'm afraid I found this volume a colossal bore. Rilla, cute as she is, was not featured as prominently as the title would suggest; nor was her love story. Set during WWI, Rilla of Ingleside chronicles the entire duration of the war and how it effected those in Canada. By the time they made it to 1918 I was praying for the war to end so the dang book would end. The scenes hardly varied. It was a continuous dull poetic procession of Rilla crying in Rainbow Valley, writing about the war in her journal or in letters to the boys on the front, Walter, the poet-phrophet turned soldier blathering on about his cowardice, and women sitting around sewing and discussing the war. I guess Montgomery must have thought Susan, the Blythe's 60-year-old housemaid, was quite a provocative character, because she kept up a steady flow of opinions on the war and their stupid cat that made me want to poke my eyes out. I've noticed that Montgomery is better at character sketches than she is at prolonged character development, and like many of the books in this series, part of the problem is that it focused on random happenings with random neighbors that I cared little about. A few thoughts on Anne. About halfway through the series I realized that Anne was receding into motherhood and becoming nothing but a stolid matronly figure amongst more spirited beings. Once she enters motherhood she isn't allowed to dream, to write, to be funny or fanciful. She becomes sentimental and adored as a mother, but almost completely unrecognizable as the Anne we know and love. I suppose this is the product of the Victorian age - proper women don't dream beyond the confines of their domestic sphere and once Anne is firmly planted in her homely sphere, well, adventures of any kind are out of the question. Maybe what we love about Anne just doesn't translate into adulthood. A child who talks too much is cute and bright. An adult who won't shut up is annoying. A young girl's romantic longings are charming, but they don't exactly have a place in a married woman's life. And Gilbert, the hero of our romance, becomes about as exciting mushed peas. I'm glad I finished the series, but I desperately wish this series had ended with a more satisfying book."}, {"userName": "Britany", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany", "userReview": "Oh Rilla-my-Rilla. This series has had its ups and downs, but this one was worth all the pain. This book was perfection. Told from Rilla Blythe's point of view in diary format, we start in early 1914 and she is carefree, frivolous and worried about what hat she'll wear to the dance. Enter the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and suddenly Ingleside finds itself ensconced in WW1. This book had everything I need and never knew I wanted from this series. Completely takes the cake for my absolute favorite \"Anne\" book. I laughed, I cried, and I couldn't get enough from these characters. Rilla really stepped up to the plate with her antics and the raising of her war-baby Jims. This book found a very harsh reality in that all the boys enlisted and poor Dog Monday sat at the train station waiting for his soldier to return. I even loved the awful Mr Hyde (the cat!)- and Susan sealed her fate in my heart.

My Dad bought me these books when I was little on the condition that I read all of them, and I've just now fulfilled that promise.Covering the duration of World War One, this book, along with Anne's House of Dreams, is definitely one of the saddest in the series. Yet these two books give the characters of Anne and her children, including the title character, her youngest daughter Rilla, a more rounded feel. The story left me with a sense that the soul can bear a lot more suffering than any of us usually think it can. There is something terrible in that, since the last thing any of us want to experience is more suffering, but also something hopeful, since it helps us to understand that we can live through it and have a sense of happiness again. Maybe not the same unburdened happiness that we used to have--but happiness nonetheless.Although the book dragged in parts (as I'm sure real life did in those times as people waited desperately for word of their loved ones at the western front), any book that so unapologetically forces me to read it in two days and makes me cry deserves five stars."}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1478426-cathy", "userReview": "[As it turns out, I couldn't have put this down even if I wanted to (not for lack of moments where I wished I'd never started this series, so there'd be no crying over beloved characters meeting an untimely death.

I actually managed to read all the way through the Anne of Green Gables series, all 8 books worth. They\u2019re not long books, and 8 might not sound like very many, but these are still technically classics and that would a good bit of classic reading in a row. While the books weren\u2019t all as wonderful as the first, none of them were bad and I feel like reading the series in its entirety was worthwhile.Out of all of the books, this last one was probably my least favorite. It was much more solemn than those preceding it, as it took place during the First World War. Getting a view of the war from the Canadian Homefront, and through the eyes of Anne\u2019s youngest daughter as she\u2019s on the cusp of womanhood, was very different and definitely interesting. We don\u2019t often give much thought to how wartime affects life for those left behind at home after the soldiers ship out, especially those in countries outside our own that don\u2019t see any fighting on their own soil. Rilla, Anne\u2019s youngest, has her life radically altered just as she enters her fifteenth year. She\u2019s a fun-loving girl who loves to laugh, and has no desire to plan for the future. The night of her first \u201cgrown up\u201d party ends with the announcement that war has been declared in Europe. Before she can wrap her mind around what\u2019s happening, every young man in her life is gone, fighting a war on foreign shore. Rilla has to grow up. She rises to the occasion and becomes a young woman that the whole community can be proud of.As with all the books, there are still funny situations. Rilla adopts a little war-baby, and her efforts with him add some much needed levity. There was also a faithful little dog who refused to leave the train station until his master came home from the war, which was a heartwarming addition. But as I said earlier, there was a solemnity to this book not present (as often) in the others due the addition of war into the plot. Montgomery did a very good job of capturing the tension and strain of those who have to stay home and just wait on news, and a masterful job of showing characters who have to bridge the divide between mourning and moving on with their lives.I\u2019m very glad that I can now say that I\u2019ve read the Anne of Green Gables series in its entirety. I think it\u2019s helped me develop a classic habit, which I\u2019m going to do my best to maintain by always having some classic I\u2019m reading, even if I\u2019m only reading a chapter or two a day in addition to the other books I\u2019m reading.

Poignantly written, never dismissing hardship, heartbreak, love, and the more common of adolescent strifes such as rivalries and embarassments, 'Rilla of Ingleside' relaxes me everytime I read it and often makes me wish that if I were a fictional character, that I'd be her."}, {"userName": "Michele", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2406800-michele", "userReview": "I knew what to expect going into this book, from inadvertently reading summaries. Even if I hadn't, the Pied Piper foreshadowing in Rainbow Valley, gave this last book's big development away. Even so, it was very moving. I read it during a flight and cried like a lunatic the whole plane route.Being mostly familiar with U. S. History, it was interesting to see the war from a Canadian perspective. Susan's view on Woodrow Wilson and his love of \"notes\" was hilarious. It makes me wish that Montgomery could have written one during World War II as well. I'd like to know what Susan would say of FDR and to see how PEI would have reacted to events leading up to the bombing of Pearl Harbor.It was interesting that women only got the right to vote during the war and only women with husbands and sons could vote at that! Despite the sexism at the time, I find Montgomery's women to be quite equal and independent thinkers, even young Rilla, the only one of the Blythe children who, seemingly, lacks ambition.It's also notable that the family did not judge \"sissy\" Walter, even if some of his school mates did. His sensitivity was a derivative of Anne's, but many societies would not appreciate or tolerate it. Given the bullying that leads to suicide and murder so often in American schools these days, the Ingleside perception of Walter seems quite topical.What Walter said in his last letter, about it being harder for him to return than to die in battle, was another prescient moment on his part. He knew that the memories of what he had seen -- done, would be overwhelming for him. It hinted at the post-traumatic stress syndrome that is acknowledged (but still not fully appreciated) today.What would certainly never fly in today's world is Bruce's drowning of the cat, to ensure Jem's safe return home. Everyone thought his gesture was \"wonderful, wonderful\". Rilla pointed out that he'd have to learn you could never bargain with God, but not one character ever criticized what he did to the poor cat! Of course, cats have been abused in stories for decades, but usually by naughty boys, not \"good\" ones. I found that episode both shocking and droll.When Walter and Faith rode pigs down the street, Gilbert jokingly objected on behalf of the swine, but he said not a word in defense of Bruce's drowned cat! Montgomery certainly knows how to personify animals when she wants, but in this instance she wasn't concerned with feline feelings.I loved the ending, but found myself wondering just why Ken Ford had taken two weeks to contact Rilla after arriving home. I concentrated on his face scar and told myself maybe he was healing from injuries and did not want to communicate with her until he could stand face to face in good health, but I'm not sure. I know his concentration was on the war, but his diffidence was frustrating. The poor girl didn't even know where she stood for 4 years.The lines that stood up and had me tearing long after the book was closed were Anne telling Susan to set the table for everyone, even the dear lad whose chair must always be vacant. Susan answered that it was not likely she'd forget to set his plate and I cry even now just typing about it."}, {"userName": "Emma Jane", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22571056-emma-jane", "userReview": "I ADORED THIS BOOK. In fact, much more than I was expecting to. Sure, everyone seems to rave about it, and it was my best friend who (gently) pushed me into reading it...but I didn't expect to LOVE it. I've read several of L.M. Montgomery's books now, and while I enjoy her writing style sometimes, overall it's not my thing, and by the time I got to Rilla of Ingleside -- the fourth book I'd read of hers in a year -- I was rather tired of it. BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER. This is one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. It's DEFINITELY my favorite Montgomery book, and probably the best book I've read about WWI. (Actually, I haven't read hardly any book about WWI, so admittedly that's not a very broad spectrum, but STILL.) I LOVED LOVED LOVED IT.  Favorite things about Rilla of Ingleside: ~ Jem and Dog Monday. Jem was one of my favorite characters, even though he wasn't actually 'present' much -- but he was spoken of, and thought about, and he wrote letters, and I love him. :-) And Dog Monday! Oh, way to rip a person's HEART out. (I really would have died of a broken heart if Jem hadn't come back and Dog Monday just kept waiting there at the station.) The part when Jem comes back and Dog Monday greets him may be my favorite part in the whole book. ~ The way everybody knows everybody in the Glen. Most of them are friends -- some of them are not-so-much, but everybody knows everybody, and somehow they manage to get along. It gives the book a very homey-friendly-feel. ~ Susan! Susan is a brick, and that you may tie to. ~ Walter's letter is.indeed.epic. So beautiful and SAAAAD and powerful. Excuse me while I sob into my pillow. ~ Dr. Blythe's well-placed witty comments -- he's still dear ol' Gilbert. :-) ~ I enjoyed how parts of the book were entries from Rilla's diary, which gave her deeper perspective into things and made part of the book first-person, which is my personal favorite kind of writing. ~ Rilla is so amazing! She grows by leaps and bounds and learns so much during the course of the war, getting stronger through all the tragedies she has to overcome. I just love how she handles things. I want to be like Rilla. This book is gorgeous; it hurts; it will make your heart flutter hopelessly. I love it and I'm so glad certain people were persistent in telling me to read it. ;-P My rating: 10/10"}, {"userName": "Audrey", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6007245-audrey", "userReview": "Rilla, the youngest of Gilbert and Anne Blythe' s children was flighty young thing when World War I started but the next four years made her into a responsible young woman. Most surprising of all is when she fosters a baby for the duration of the war. This is an heart-breaking and triumphant story of the Great War."}, {"userName": "Kirsty", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56491386-kirsty", "userReview": "Rilla of Ingleside is number 619 upon the Virago Modern Classics list, and is another addition to the children\u2019s literature which the publishing house is introducing to a whole new generation of readers. This particular L.M. Montgomery novel is recommended for those from the age of nine onwards.Rilla of Ingleside, first published in 1921, is the last book in Montgomery\u2019s famous Anne of Green Gables series, and can be read as a standalone book. It takes place when title character Anne Shirley is an adult with her own grown-up children, almost all of whom have flown the nest. The only one who remains within her care is her youngest daughter, fourteen-year-old \u2018high-spirited\u2019 Rilla. Just as Rilla\u2019s life is at the height of her enjoyment, it is announced that Britain has declared war on Germany, and will be fighting for the full four years of the First World War. This affects Rilla more than she imagines at first, and serves to alter her landscape entirely: \u2018\u2026 as her brothers go off to fight in the Great War and Rilla brings home an orphaned newborn baby in a soup tureen, she is swept into a drama that tests her courage and will leave her changed forever.\u2019Rilla of Ingleside starts in a charming way \u2013 \u2018It was a warm, golden-cloudy, lovable afternoon\u2019 \u2013 before it introduces the character of Susan Baker and the historical context which the story is set against: in the newspaper, she sees that \u2018some Archduke Ferdinand or other had been assassinated at a place bearing the weird name of Sarajevo, but Susan tarried not over uninteresting, immaterial stuff like that; she was in quest of something really vital\u2019. The historical details have been set out in such a way that they are easily accessible to Montgomery\u2019s intended younger audience. Each child reader, whilst being swept into the story, is sure to learn a lot from the novel.Montgomery is an incredibly perceptive author, always ensuring that her readers are able to see exactly what she imagined a particular person, scene or setting to look like. In their entirety, her characters are wonderfully drawn, and their differences help to make them distinct beings. Throughout, Montgomery\u2019s writing is gorgeous; it feels as though she set out to weave a spell of enchantment each and every time she sat down to write. Rilla of Ingleside is a lovely story on the whole, and the storyline which has been crafted fits its historical setting very well indeed."}, {"userName": "Fatemeh Nazari", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05,

I think the straw that broke the camel's back was when Marilla's death is merely glanced over in one...count it, ONE...sentence. I want to hear about Avonlea. I miss the romance and the scenery and the people of Avonlea. This is no longer the Anne of Green Gables series, it is the \"Anne's Kids and their Friends\" series. Perhaps it's because I neglected to read these stories when I was younger, sort of in the same way I really can't appreciate Newsies because I never saw it in those pre-pubescent years when every little girl has a crush on every boy in the film. I do however still love the A of GG movies...and the soundtrack, which I highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Belle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36740512-belle", "userReview": "My goal was to read the complete series in 2017.

It's not much about Anne, yes, and a lot of folks have a problem with that, but it's about Anne's youngest child; her daughter, Rilla. Rilla starts out as a brat, Rilla grows up into a mature, sweet woman. This book goes through all that. She has her mother's spirit and love of beauty, but she doesn't have the hot redheaded temper. ;) I can't exactly put my finger on what made this book so perfect. It might have been the war-baby, because I was absolutely enchanted by that the first time I read it. And I've still loved little Jims like crazy all three times I've read this. But I think what makes this book special is it's ability to make you feel different emotions. Usually when I read a \"tearjerker\" section in a book, I'll cry the first time. This was different, the second time I read it I cried all over again, even though I had been sure I wouldn't. I cried again the third time, too. The romance between Kenneth Ford and Rilla is very sweet, and not overdone like so many love stories. When they're sitting on the porch and Rilla is mortified because Jims has \"spoiled everything\" and Ken won't say anything, and yet the reason he's not saying anything (though she doesn't know it) is because he's looking at her snuggling Jims and falling in love with her right there. I think that's one of the sweetest romantic scenes ever in any book.There are some books that never get old, and as I was looking over this one a few days ago I realized that this is one of those books."}, {"userName": "Susann", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/959531-susann", "userReview": "It was so nice to have Rilla waiting for me, as I went through my 'Anne' series re-read. I would love to take a class on WWI and have 'Rilla' as one of my texts. Because Montgomery wrote this shortly after the War ended, all the details seem so fresh and ripe for discussion: the battles, the politics, the Canadian perspective, the role of women, the emerging technologies, and - my favorite - the jingoism. It's fascinating to read Montgomery's casual mentions of bricks being thrown through windows. And it's a little disconcerting to find myself agreeing with the peace sentiments of Whiskers-on-the-Moon. Rilla's coming-of-age is a great one, and Montgomery is at her finest here in combining the Ken Ford romance with humor. Gertrude Oliver is a really intense housemate and I wouldn't want to spend the duration with her. Bruce Meredith made me teary when he brought Anne the mayflowers, but completely creeped me out when he drowned his own kitten. As a Betsy-Tacy fan, I would jump at the chance to put Susan and Bob Ray in a room together.

She had spunk, she was stubborn, she was whimsical, she knew how to love and she knew what loss was. Rilla is not a three-dimensional character, or at least not to the same extent that her mother was. It's been ages since I read these books, and maybe I'd enjoy this one more if I were to read it again as an adult, but by the time I get through Anne of Ingleside, I'm so entirely fed up with the series that I can't be bothered to continue."}], "description": "Anne's children were almost grown up, except for pretty, high-spirited Rilla. No one could resist her bright hazel eyes and dazzling smile. Rilla, almost fifteen, can't think any further ahead than going to her very first dance at the Four Winds lighthouse and getting her first kiss from handsome Kenneth Ford. But undreamed-of challenges await the irrepressible Rilla when the world of Ingleside becomes endangered by a far-off war. Her brothers go off to fight, and Rilla brings home an orphaned newborn in a soup tureen. She is swept into a drama that tests her courage and leaves her changed forever.", "title": "Rilla of Ingleside\n      \n          (Anne of Green Gables #8)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433533.Rilla_of_Ingleside__Anne_of_Green_Gables___8_", "average": 4.16, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1285712722l/433533.jpg", "reviews": 1324, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5350.L_M_Montgomery", "name": "L.M.
