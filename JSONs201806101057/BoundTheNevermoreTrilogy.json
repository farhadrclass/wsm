It\u2019s a pseudo zombie story that follows a couple who\u2019s love overcomes insurmountable odds. It\u2019s corny, and does require a bit of a leap vis-\u00e0-vis why only Mara & Bastian\u2019s connection trumps all where as other twosomes \u201cturn\u201d. But, it\u2019s written in such a way that it\u2019s next to impossible to put down, and makes you want to believe in unicorns.Phase two of the end-of-the-civilization involved the army taking over, the abuse that comes along with the government going belly-up, and rumours of a cure. Unsurprisingly, several factions pop up in the wake of the Nevermore disaster, and Mara & Bastien get caught right in the middle due to their unusual abilities. We meet some pretty scary people along the way, namely Vincent and Donovan, and the author had no qualms about highlighting how truly deprived humanity can become when society as we know it crumbles. BOUND will make you cry uncle!BOUND was not your typical zombie story. ~4.5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Cathy (cathepsut)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/978552-cathy-cathepsut", "userReview": "The storyline continues directly after Sundered. Considering the length of the book, both of them, probably together with the third installment of this trilogy, would have made a decently sized full novel. The story of Mara and Sebastian continues, with a plot twist bringing them into contact with other survivors and a possible cure for the Nevermore drug.The first book was entertaining enough, despite some minor flaws. But Bound, although the plot idea was good, was pretty weak in terms of storyline development. It felt rushed, ideas were often just hinted at. It could have done with more depth into the story as well as the characters. Some of those were little more than caricatures.Bottomline, not bad. But could have done with some fleshing out. The characters stayed a little flat and the whole thing left me unsatisfied. I am mildy curious about the ending to the trilogy, but considering the length (or lack thereof) I am not interested enough to spend more money on it."}, {"userName": "Dee Avila", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4904623-dee-avila", "userReview": "The second book in Mayer's Nevermore Trilogy Bound is another fast pace and fun read. The romance continues between Sebastian and Mara. Their love amazes me. Once again the turmoil this couple goes through is heart breaking but their love for one another never falters. In this book we are with Mara as she struggles to survive the Nevermore out break. I was happy to find out that this book flowed seamlessly from the first. I bought it when I bought the first and was glad that I had it to move immediately on to. Bound left me hoping for Dauntless which is to be released at the end of October. Thankfully not to far away.

We learn that the Nevermores can and do communicate with each other and the hoard as a whole, like a hive almost.We learn that a few Nevermores cling to the last bits of their humanity, like Scout. And we learn that the military-ish people, dressed in fatigues, they come and tell Mara that it just isn't safe and she MUST go with them. At first she resists, fearing for Sebastian and losing him, so they basically take her. Someone follows.These \"military-esque\" men are somewhat whipped into submission by their lead asshats, the first of which is named Vincent.

Their situation has worsened in this second book but Mara still fights to save both her husband and her unborn baby. Not so much against the creatures called Nevermores, this time her battles are more with her own kind - the humans. Ms Mayer has a unique way of creating characters and telling a story and I hope she's around for a very long time. How she ever came up with the premise for this trilogy, I can't imagine.

The love line of the story is great, while the suspense builds consistently. The tension never slacks and the original angle on the zombie-related issues is refreshing.

But, if she is to find the cure, to help Sebastian, she must face down a whole new set of dangers. A sadistic army General whose hatred knows no bounds.A brilliant scientist whose love for his lost wife drives him to madness.And a new pack of Nevermores . . .Sensitive readers should know going in that there is a child death in this story.While this one did end in what I would consider to be a \"cliff-hanger\", I do have to admit that it was a much better stopping point than that of the previous installment, Sundered.Even having not read the final installment, Dauntless (expected release October 31, 2011), I have to say my very strong opinion thus far is that the entire series should probably be consolidated into a single, longer story and given a higher price point. While I understand that the current price of ninety-nine cents for Sundered, and right at three dollars for Bound, is a definite selling point for readers unfamiliar with the author, the fact that this book picks up literally a sentence after the last one left off makes it virtually impossible for readers unfamiliar with the series to really get the full benefit of the story. While the general gist of the history of the apocalypse is covered, as is the relationship between Mara and Sebastian, I do think that some readers who did not read Sundered will be highly disappointed with just how obvious it is that the first book is an integral part of this one.That said, I would still recommend both Sundered and Bound to any fan of zombie apocalypse fans, especially those who prefer a strong romantic theme. Gritty, violent, tragic, and terrifying, this whole series also manages to be touching, romantic, and at times, even sexy (which let me tell you, is an achievement considering the hero is a zombie). Just make certain that you pick up the first book before attempting this one and you won't have any problems.I am actually very excited to have found this author. Even with the slightly-campy feel to the initial premise, her skill in creating believable characters and writing both action and love scenes is truly much more than I've experienced in a self-published author in quite some time. I am very anxiously awaiting the final installment on Halloween, and can't wait to see what becomes of Mara, Sebastian, Scout, Buck, and the others.Recommended for fans of fresh takes on the zombie apocalypse trope, of normal people surviving on their wits, and of a love that not even a zombie infection can stop.A very solid 4.5/5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Latisha Bramlett", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19229131-latisha-bramlett", "userReview": "I received an ARC of this book and this is my honest opinion. This is part two of a trilogy. Mara and Bastian are trying to adjust to their new reality. They are wondering how much longer they will be able to be together. If that wasn't enough, the military gets involved and Mara and Bastian have to fight to survive and for each other. This series shows that the 'monster' isn't always the obvious one.

The action and danger does not let up, and is a daily part of their lives, only it is not just the Nevermores, but other humans with invested interests who pose a threat. Fearing that she is losing Sebastian to the Nevermore drug, Mara dares to hope that rumours of a cure are true and is willing to risk anything to save him. With Sebastian more Nevermore than human, Mara feels more alone than ever. She only has her survival instincts, a little bit of luck and most important of all her belief in her and Bastian's love to depend on. Never has their love been more important and it is about to be tested time and time again, with conflicting feelings and forces from within and out. Mara gets her time to shine and her need to survive is not just for herself and Bastian anymore, but for the life growing inside her. Amidst a world gone mad, friends become enemies and enemies become friends. Scout, a Nevermore is an unlikely friend but one who continues to show his allegiance to Mara and Bastian. He is an anomaly within the Nevermores and gives hope that they can retain some of their humanity, while some humans can lack this. The introduction of Burns, a young and impressionable soldier is a great contrast to Marks, a seasoned man, experienced with love and loss. These two men are so different and yet similar in how they help Mara, thus showing their humanity. What really appeals to me was seeing Mara and Sebastian's love develop in a whole new way. Their communication relies heavily on actions and small nuances rather than words. Their love bounds them and these emotions are what keeps Sebastian human. With her life on the line, and facing the likes of Vincent and Donavan, Mara is placed in situations that allows her to grow a backbone and have to make tough decisions. Some scenes are graphic but brief, showing that it's a dog eat dog world where the fittest and smartest survive. No longer the sweet, wallowing self that she was a few mere months ago, Mara learns that morals are not always enough to survive. What never wavers is her belief in Bastian and their love and that is what keeps me rooting for her and Sebastian.Bound is a short and riveting story that I finished in a day. I wasn't surprised at the cliffhanger in the end and will be looking forward to Dauntless to see what awaits Mara and Sebastian."}, {"userName": "chucklesthescot", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3426724-chucklesthescot", "userReview": "Mara and Bastian are captured by the military at their home and taken to a prison camp where Mara is told she has to train the monsters to obey her like Bastian, so they can be used for military purposes. Vincent wants to use an army of monsters to attack his enemy who is working on a cure. Not trusting Vincent, Mara is convinced that they must escape or die.I certainly didn't like this book as much as the first one in the series. I was still interested in the relationship between Mara and Bastian but I also questioned why Mara decided to restart a sexual relationship with him without knowing if the virus was going to damage her. Overall, Mara wasn't very smart in this book. Spying on Vincent so blatantly was dumb and could have led to them both being killed. But the thing that really infuriated me was Mara deciding she was attracted to the first soldier who was kind to her, which makes her supposed undying love for Bastian seem like a bit of a joke. It ruined the interest I had in the unconventional relationship between Mara and Bastian.Vincent wasn't really a character that greatly interested me. Even when we are shown why he is such an asshat and why he is obsessed with finding the cure, he still feels like the big evil cartoon bad guy. In fact most of the military men in this book are power hungry asshats who annoyed me. I did continue to like Scout though. He sort of reminds me of the boy Roach who lived inside the walls in the film The People under the Stairs. The plot for me was a bit on the weak side. The military just happened to pass by Mara's house in time to see her interact with Bastian and suddeny come to grab them both? Super evil military men fight over an experimental cure? Our poor heroes caught in the middle? I wasn't greatly convinced and this is more of a 2/2.5 book.
