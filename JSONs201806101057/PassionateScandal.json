The h was 18 and the H was 28 when they had a sudden attack of the Lurve Force Mojo in the pool one day and a big romance was on the boil. (Let this be a lesson to a HP voyagers, Don't Go Near the Water, dangerous things could happen.)Since the h and H's families had been friends for yonks and the H's family is a big time merchant banking family and the h's dad is a big time risky corporate entrepreneur, the two families think it is a match made in heaven. The h is known as the wild child of the family and the H is seen as the future leader of the banking clan, so their romance and ensuing engagement is seen as the merging of dynasties in an understated English Gentry kind of way. The h, for her part, is wildly in love with the H and ready to justify her love. The H, well he kinda seems to be very interested back, but the H is a TEASE and his continual refusal to relieve the h of her unicorn grooming status is driving her nuts. She isn't sure if the H is really into her or really into the familial dynastic empire vibe and so she waits until the two of them have a private evening alone and she dons one of her dad's silk shirts and some skimpy knickers and she tries to seduce the H.His reaction - he spanks her like a spoilt child and then calls her a shameless tart. The h, who has a black temper to go with her black hair, tells him if he isn't interested, other men will be and starts crying as the H storms off after she threw her engagement ring back at him. A little while later, the h called all her friends for an impromptu house rave and she is making out with a local lad on the couch, when the H comes in and has a hissy fit. The h realizes that maybe she went a bit too far, but the H doesn't want to know. The engagement is ended, but the two families still appear at a lot of the same social functions and the rumors that the h is running wild around the men is all over town.The h and the H and their families all show up at the same country club party and the H is with another woman. The H drags the h out onto the dance floor to keep up convivial appearances and then he starts in on the tarty comments again. The h plays up the drama to hilt as she sinks to her knees in the middle of the dance floor in mocking contrition.  The H looks like an utter wanker and storms off again and the h, tired of all the drama and heartbroken, flees to her mother in Boston for four years. The book opens with the h's return to her father's and stepmum's house. The h's stepsister is getting married and she has requested the h's presence at the wedding. The h has spent the last four years having a mopey moment and getting some social sophistication. She and her Boston male BFF, who is also in recovery for heartbreak, arrive in England and the big family reunion is set to begin. The reunion is marred for the h tho, her English BFF, who happens to be the H's sister, is banned from the h's home cause of the two father's feuding.The h is horrified that her little contretemps with the H has led to outright warfare and now her stepsister and her BFF can't do the bridesmaid thingy like they planned and everything is awful. Plus the h can't even go to her favorite seekrit spot and spy on the dilapidated Elizabethan manor next door without running into the H. The next big portion of the story is the h and H trying to figure out a way to end the feud. The H wants to go the fake romance rekindle with the h route, but after ANOTHER teasing H roofie kissing and gropey moment that AGAIN leaves the h hanging for a lurve club connection, the h tells the H off and accuses him of very manipulative and bullying behavior. The h recalls an prior incident where they both slapped each other in the wake of one of their explosive arguments and she just wants to be done with the situation. So the h has a dinner party and she invites all her BFF's and the H's sister and the H and his date. Then they all show up at a party together, obviously fine with everybody and the two father's are forced to reconcile. Then the H decides that he is ready to commit to the h. So he gets her to go over to her favorite dilapidated Elizabethan manor, that is in the process of reconstruction, and he tells the h that it is hers, along with a very old painting of it. The H sorta apologizes for holding out on the unicorn grooming license revocation, he claims that he was going nuts with lust, but he thought if he gave into the h, she would get bored and go find another dragon to ride. Now tho, they are both still wild about each other and the H is going to back the h's father's latest business venture and they can finally get around to the big Lurve Force Mojo Pink Purple Passion moment. The h and H are now firmly together and maybe he can channel all his excess Lurve Force into other avenues of h interaction besides physically hitting her.The h's stepsister has her wedding and the h and H are all cuddled up, when the H and h have a minor spat and all the guests are thinking there is going to be another scene. This time tho, the h's Boston BFF announces the H and h are married and have been for a week. Everybody is delighted and the H and h go home to their Elizabethan manor, secure in their love and ready to express it. The house is pretty happy as well, as it feels like it too is loved again in the conclusion of this HP outing. This one is okay, but it is VERY dated and the father's feuding takes up ages and ages of page count. The H was an utter nematode slime gulper for most of the book. It was pretty clear that MR was using the H's physical aggression to reflect his inner frustrated passion for the h, but it comes off as abusive and not thwarted longing. Reading this book now definitely puts a big damper on the romance, cause this thing reads like a textbook of red flags for a domestic abuser. Still, MR can do the passionate longing bit very well and the frustration of the h was pretty believable. The family interactions were pretty sweet and you could probably do worse for an HPlandia outing."}, {"userName": "willaful", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2833071-willaful", "userReview": "This is so dated and confused, I can barely believe it was pulished in 1994 instead of 1974.

I think for a short book, it successfullydelves into and explores what makes a relationship between two people who truly love each other fall apart. Sometimes it's a complex mix of internal and external forces. In the case of Madeline and Dominic, it was insecurity, differences in age, and fears on how that affected their relationship, and too much interference from their family in their relationship.I liked that neither was perfect and neither was demonized. Neither was the bad guy who destroyed their relationship the first time around. Madeline was young and willful, and Dominic was presumptuous and controlling. Eventually that worked against their first chance at love. But four years later, they are able to see past all that and find the strong chord of deep love between them and refuse to allow their insecurities, pride and fears stand in the way. I truly liked that about this story. I love that idea that two people who truly love each other will get the chance to be together, and I like that Ms. Reid delivered that in this book. I also loved the intensity between them, that strong, fierce emotion that neither could deny. Even four years later, it was so strong that they couldn't move on with other people. That love drew them back together.This was a quick, involving read. Not just a momentary diversion, but involving me emotionally in the story. Normally with lovers reunited, I feel like more than anything there is too much angst and repercussions about why it didn't work the first time, and this doesn't draw me into a story. I prefer the first contact and the build of their relationship to the happy ending. In this case, I found it interesting to see how they were able to get past what went wrong in the past and work it out in the future. The layers intrigued me and kept me enthralled in the story. I saw a lot of growth and maturity in both Madeline and Dominic, and I appreciate that. Of course the HP drama and zing also makes for a good read for me. Another thumbs up book by this author on my keeper shelf."}, {"userName": "KC 2.0", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41351255-kc-2-0", "userReview": "[Although engaged, Madeline and Dominic hadn't consummated their relationship yet.

So much so, that I think the love story suffered. Maybe it's just me. I think if some of the subplots were taken out or maybe scenes, I don't know. There just seemed to be too much going on for me to care enough about two characters you really should care about.Also, there was a lot of build up to the \"scene\" that changed everyone's lives, and I was left a little deflated.

I don't get too heavily invested, everything's predictable and the too-good-to-be-true HEA being imminent, it's only a question of 'how' rather than 'why'. But that wasn't the case here. I'm precisely halfway into the novel and I'm too disgusted by it to continue. I had never given up a Michelle Reid novel...until this one.The FP is a magnificent troublemaker who's only eighteen when the scandal took place. That's four years ago. The MP is over ten years older than her. He's supposed to be a grown up but it doesn't reflect in his actions. Usually Reid's heroes are super possessive alpha males, terribly sexist but inherently good human beings who seduce rather than slap . This one spanks his fiancee when unable to tame her. Knowing they'd end up together then, I couldn't read through to find out the 'how' of it. I do not want to invest a minute more in a novel where I can respect neither the MP nor the FP. It's no Wuthering Heights after all!"}, {"userName": "Fiona Marsden", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8076934-fiona-marsden", "userReview": "An immature and spoiled young woman is humiliated by her fianc\u00e9 and runs away.

Lots a tension and sexual awakening in that scene. Dominic takes the lead and asks her out. Still reeling Maddy agees. Thus begins their hot and heavy courtship with everyone pushing them or offering advice, which starts confusing them.Maddy and Dominic both have ideas on how their relationship should go but they starting loosing track of it and forget to talk. Maddy wants to go all the way and he doesn't. She starts wondering if he really loves or wants her. Being older Dominic is trying to slow things down but never explains his reasons to her. More confusion. The young Maddy tries to seduce him and he rejects her. Rejecting her hurts him but once again he does not talk to her. Yes, she is young and innocent (which is reason he is trying to protect her, right??), then he should be explaining the whys to her.Wow! He spanks her because she is being a child. Really! What kind of fiance spanks their woman? That gets her mad and she retaliates and hurts him. But she tries to make amends and then he humilates her in public....so bad.She runs away to America where she matures and vows that no one will ever hurt her like that again or cause a major scene. She likes to be in control of her emotions and enviroment. Going back to England for her step-sister's wedding, family and friends are shocked by the new Maddy. Gone is the happy glowing bouncy girl full of adventure. Dominic has not been idle either in the bank or his social life. Maddy really displays some amazing maturity and determination to resist his idea of a fake relationship to help bring their families together again. She shows him that it all can be done without getting everyone excited over a 'fake' relationship. You can just feel his disappointment!There is not a POV from his standpoint but he displays some amazing emotions that you don't need to wonder what he is thinking or feeling.The ending comes together so sweetly and just finishes this book off so nicely. This was an absolute wonderful book!"}, {"userName": "Roub", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13716731-roub", "userReview": "what an awesome read! i love everything about the book ! yet i wish more drama near the end and dats why i minused one star. i dunt believe Dominic was responsible for their breakup. Madeline behaved abominably. she behaved like a bitch and a slut ! ofc she did not deserve the spanking she got but what she did after, as retaliation, blew things out of proportion. she proved she was highly volatile, out of control and cud easily cheat on Dominic if she had enough provocation. it was highly commendable of Dom dat he still loved her after four years of separation. he was angry she had escaped from the situation because had not held grudges for long. he had always loved her and forgave her for her impulsiveness and volatile temper. this book definitely tops my list of favourites. i dunno how i missed it before. this was full of angst and rich in highly charged emotions. another little treasure from Michelle Reid!"}, {"userName": "Lede", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25492952-lede", "userReview": "Boring, before and after finding out what actually happened to send her fleeing."}, {"userName": "Shakira", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23464871-shakira", "userReview": "1.5 stars"}, {"userName": "L H", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21678143-l-h", "userReview": "3.5"}, {"userName": "Shakira", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50255465-shakira", "userReview": "1.5 stars"}], "description": "Wild and willful, Madeline had run rings around the besotted men who fell for her wicked blue eyes and black mane of hair.
