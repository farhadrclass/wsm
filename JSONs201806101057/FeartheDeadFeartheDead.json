There are currently two books in this series the second having just been released. At the time of this reader's purchase the book is a very reasonable \u00a31.99 on Amazon.co.uk for Kindle.I like the author's style. It's punchy and short and to the point. There's not a lot of zombie gun porn in this novel and that is definitely to the book's credit. There is also an excellent new type of zombie in this book which added fear and loathing to this outbreak of undead (grip your seat kind of terror). The protagonist in the story is a loner and doesn't wish at all to be any kind of hero, he's lost a lot and made a few mistakes and he beats himself (and others) up because of it.I want to point out a few things and I hope the author doesn't mind. There isn't any background given in this book at all really. Not about the main character, the outbreak or even the canon (the world) that we find ourselves in. A good example would be the new type of zombie that's introduced. There's nothing quite like it in any of the other zompocalypse books I've read which is very cool but at the same time we get so little description of it that it loses some of scariness that's introduced in the beginning of the book when it first appears. Also, this world takes place well into the future after such an outbreak but there's no memories or discussions (monologue) of this at all. Which is a shame because as there are very few zombie books that take place in the British Isles and it would have added a lot to this tale.I would have only given this book three stars but the last 30 pages or so really found a stride and brought the strength of the author's story and writing together.I hope that by the third book the author can start to tell us, even if only from the main protagonist's viewpoint, some of the lore and history of this world he finds himself in.Looking forward to the next book when I read it. Probably next!"}, {"userName": "Angela Verdenius", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11378467-angela-verdenius", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book.

They all have the typical gore and survival instincts. What I liked about this book was it was written in first person. Kyle , the main character is a loner and doesn't trust anyone. He meets different characters on his journey, but can they be trusted? The author did a good job of having action that keeps the reader entertained and hungry for more. He brings us through his writing style a book that shows the drive to survive and the obstacles that they face trying to succeed. At first I didn't care for Kyle. He seemed arrogant and a need to do things on his own. The author did a great job showing thst Kyke is also vulnerable and has to decide if he can really make it on his oen? He at times let his pride get the best of him. There are other characters in the book you will either cheer for or have a feeling of hate for. It is all about survival of the fittest and who is willing to dig deep into their selves to overcome the ones who want you dead. The description of the dead and what they can do to you if infected was well written and painted a picture of true fear in some . There is always a fear of the unknown. What Mr. Lewis has done has used thst fear to show the strength of from people who want to survive and conquer the enemy. Where there be a time when we may be called on to fight together to destroy the fear that lurks among us? The story line was action packed and moved along quickly.,The question is do you want to fear the dead, the stalker or survive?"}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5149932-kristen", "userReview": "I received this book through a giveaway on librarything.com in exchange for an honest review.This was a quick read, I think it took me two or three hours to get through it. The book was okay. I felt it was more of a short story than a book. Perhaps if it appeared in a longer anthology of zombie/apocalypse type stories I would have enjoyed it more. I found the narrator Kyle to be a sort of irritating fellow. I thought he was sort of whiny, and in addition to that it was almost as if he was trying to convince the reader that he was tougher than he really was. He gets hooked up with this younger kid (Justin) who again and again does the exact opposite of what Kyle tells him to do, and yet he lets him stick around. I think one of the main complaints I had was that we know next to nothing about Justin. I was almost hoping for him to be Torben's son since he is somewhere with the mother, the reader never does find out where. I thought that would be an interesting little tidbit of information. All in all it wasn't a terrible read. At the end of the book the author does say that there will be a second book with other characters, perhaps it will answer some questions from this past book or shed some light on Justin and where he came from."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12788743-jamie", "userReview": "A quick read lasting 2 hours depending on reading speed. Well written. A zombie book that has all the classic parts, a solo man encounters a young partner on his journey to a specific location, zombies and encounters with humans occur. Slight negative the main character talks like how we all feel if we were in a zombie apocalypse, whatever we would do would be faultless and perfect and everyone else will get us killed. this ability of hindsight as his foresight was kinda nagging throughout and made me dislike the main character especially as his arrogance got himself in the tough spots mostly but I can see a lot of people would relate as they read because they would think along the same lines as him. I enjoyed the read but im biased and enjoy anything zombie related. nothing outstanding actually occurs that makes the book more unique or memorable such as the passage achieves or zombie fallout or we're alive the podcast. but a quick read containing the undead did what it was suppose to in a very short read and kept me entertained for two hours in the garden. the second book sounds promising..."}, {"userName": "Alice J.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29103098-alice-j", "userReview": "Fear the Dead is a zombie apocalypse novel. Set fifteen years after the initial outbreak, the reader finds Kyle Vauss who has spent his time wandering around England. He lost his wife but always remembered the promise he made to her that they would reach the old farm owned by her dad and so with a battered old GPS and armed with nothing more than the bag on his back, he sets out to find it.Kyle is waylaid one night when a stalker--something that has evolved from being just a zombie--begins to stalk him. He is wounded and taken to the local town where he meets Justin, a teenager born inside the walls of Vasey and without a clue how the real world is outside. Justin attaches himself to Kyle in a move that outwits him and Kyle has no choice but to let him tag along if he plans to reach the farm. They are dogged along the way by more than just zombies.This was a good read.

Kyle is a loner, years after the zombies first arrived, who stumbles upon other survives and ends up being taken in by them, only to leave again as soon as he can. However, a teenager tricks his way into being his companion, as do a few others along the way, and while Kyle doesn't become the sort of person you'd want at a party, he is certainly the right person to survive with. Of course not everyone sees it that way, as the survivors become hunted.The characters are nicely done, if missing a bit of backstory. There's a touch of repetition in some of the narrative, but nothing terrible and thankfully, for once in a zombie novel, the fight scenes are dealt with quickly, rather than being dragged out for pages after page. All in all, a great start to a series. Looking forward to the next one now."}, {"userName": "D.J.

While \"Fear the Dead\" isn't long on reflection, the two main survivors in the tale show an endearing amount of growth in what was a very quick read for me. There's a tiny bit of a slow down a quarter of the way through, but it never happens again until the heads have rolled and the hero is planning his next move (presumably, the next book).There were also some nice moments of edge of your seat tension here or there that made me forget I was reading, like when the characters are searching through a dark building that's been flashing warning signs at the reader for two chapters.Overall, \"Fear of the Dead\" was entertaining, short on fluff, and constantly fighting to maintain its pace. Both a coming of age story and a quest, it's well worth the price."}, {"userName": "Sherron Capitano", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43117873-sherron-capitano", "userReview": "Fast moving story and well developed charactersI enjoyed this story and look forward to reading the next book.

I'm not a fan of first person narrative, but it really worked here--probably because I really liked the main man. I felt a connection with him only a chapter or two into the book. It's a character driven story, and you actually care what happens to them. I felt the characters actions and responses were realistic to their situation. The good guys gave hope for the future; and the bad guys made you root for \"team zombie\". The book keeps pace and flows nicely from beginning to end, always moving the reader forward. I love a good \"journey\" story. There were moments of mild gore and some \"creep me out\" scenes but not \"blood for the sake of blood\". Foul language was kept to a minimum and used only when necessary. An overall good read for the general population. I highly recommend this book!"}, {"userName": "Carrie Kellenberger", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2048986-carrie-kellenberger", "userReview": "The zombie apocalypse began 15 years ago and life has been very different for Kyle since his wife was turned into a zombie.

You like them, there's even a twinge of empathy for the big bad, so I thoroughly enjoyed this.

My favorite aspect of the zombie and P.A. stories is not the monsters, the weapons and tactics or what caused the end but rather how the survivors deal with the horror that is now their life. This is where I think Jack Lewis does a very good job. The protagonist, Kyle has been through 15 years of hell and when we meet him he is not easy to like.

Granted, with humanity's luck, it probably will be mostly dumb people who survive the zombie apocalypse, but it didn't make them likeable. Plus, I don't understand the passing of time versus mileage. The main character has been walking, walking, walking for what seems like forever, but when he decides (after still more walking) that he is tired of walking, he is still within walking distance of one of the people he was walking away from and that person's car.
