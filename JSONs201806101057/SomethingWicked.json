They brought even more to the table this time around. I absolutely loved that Kelly Parra and Jenny Peterson continued their short stories form Prom Dates to Die For and I really hope they continue them on some more and hopefully one day make them into a full length novel series. I think the overall layout of the stories, in terms of story order, was excellently executed. They placed them very smartly and I totally agree with it. I have always been one who thought short stories were too short (haha), but these anthologies are really making me reconsider my love/hate relationship with short stories. I absolutely adore them now."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11364723-janet", "userReview": "What a better month to read this book than October!

Each of these stories is unexpected. Authors took time to create surprising stories with thought provoking endings. These short stories were written in such a way that you get to know the characters intentions in a short period of time. The stories go well together, are quickly read and each bring variety and a different level of intensity.Cover:I can assume the cover was inspired by El d\u00eda de los muertos (Day of the dead). Looks wicked and mischievous. All the stories were written by the same authors from Prom Dates To Die For. The only new addition to this scary writing journey of Something Wicked was Mary Hestekin. Look for Prom Dates To Die For and give it an opportunity to scare you! Thanks again to Buzz Books for providing me with a copy of their scary stories and give me the opportunity to provide my sincere review according to the merit of this book."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth  Bert", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12815065-elizabeth-bert", "userReview": "This book was like the title says , SOMETHING WICKED . And i mean that in a good way. You know how the little boy from The Incredibles says, \"That was totally wicked!\" Well thats exactly how i felt, i even had that chessy smile. Thats how i looked right after i read the book. This book was a collection of short stories put together, each one different from the other. But each one still getting the attention it needed. Again this book was great ^.^ I recommend it to everybody who LOVES stories about mystical creatures \u2665 [:"}, {"userName": "Lena Brown", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8986754-lena-brown", "userReview": "Excited to be a part of this anthology - fall (and Halloween) is my favorite time of the year. I look forward to hearing what readers think about this anthology full of six eerie stories. Mine is \"Arach War\" based on an Athena legend I hadn't read about before- but my tween daughter had. I was thrilled to bring the old tale forward to present day. Vengeance can be hell on Halloween."}], "description": "\"Mesmerizing and eerie!\" -Tara Hudson, author of HEREAFTER and ARISEThey\u2019re baaaaaack.More frightful fun from the authors who brought you the young adult paranormal collection, PROM DATES TO DIE FOR, plus one more story from debut author Mari Hestekin.Kraken!
