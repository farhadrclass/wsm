The edition I had of the play had commentary from both Ludwig and a director from the Royal Shakespeare Company (which commissioned this work) talking about Ludwig's love for Shakespeare and how this comedy is much deeper than one might suppose. I didn't see it. There's a love for old Hollywood here, but Ludwig takes historical characters like James Cagney, the Warners, Dick Powell and Joe E. Brown and doesn't give them all that much to do. Any production would be left with the awkward middle ground of trying to get actors to develop passable impersonations (at least in the case of Cagney, who people still remember) for no real effect. The central plot is the somewhat overused story of a talentless girlfriend cast in an important part by the powerful man (in this case Sam Warner) who wants to appease her. In the cleverest bit, Oberon and Puck, the \"real\" fairy king and Robin Goodfellow, make an appearance. They fall in love with a starlet (Oberon) and with the glamor of the Hollywood life (Puck) when they are cast in the film as themselves by an unknowing director. All is well enough to this point, but then Ludwig's farce devolves into a repetitive use of the same schtick: Oberon produces a magic flower that will make characters fall in love with the first person they see after smelling it. This happens repeateadly, and of course, because of various mishaps, nobody ever falls in love with the person they should. It might have been funny once, but Ludwig gets lazy and uses it over and over. That and the use of various Shakespearean lines out of context provide almost all of the humor. In my opinion, it's a bit thin. Shakespeare in Love covers similar ground with much more depth and better use of the characters. Here, there are too many players without enough to do. The setup is better than the farce that results. I don't know all of Ludwig, but Lend Me a Tenor, Moon over Buffalo, and even Leading Ladies are better plays."}, {"userName": "Brandon Leatherman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24128267-brandon-leatherman", "userReview": "I was expecting this to be pretty terrible for some reason, but it wasn't so bad. Shakespeare in a Woody Allen-esque play setting. It would be fun to do this play sometime."}, {"userName": "Rachelle Urist", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3748817-rachelle-urist", "userReview": "Another funny play by Ken Ludwig, author of LEND ME A TENOR and MOON OVER BUFFALO. Anything he writes is worth reading - or seeing! My only qualification: this play, though erudite, is not as funny as his other plays. Well worth reading, though. May be funnier seen than read. Stay tuned! The published play has a wonderful preface by Simon Reade, former Artistic Director of the Bristol Old Vic and former Literary Manager of the Royal Shakespeare Company."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5173917-barbara", "userReview": "Pretty slutmagic appearances by good-looking Oberon and tiny PuckAnother beautyHeartthrob Dick PowellJames Cagney for realBoxer Joe.
