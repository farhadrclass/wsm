I\u2019d never heard of Darien Gee or Amish Friendship Bread before. For the first 50 pages or so, I just kind of plodded along, enjoying it well enough but not finding it particularly outstanding. But somewhere along the way I got so sucked in that I didn't want to put the book down to go to sleep. There are a lot of characters, and keeping up with all of them may be part of why it took me a bit to really get my bearings. But as the pages turned, the characters\u2019 distinct personalities came through and I felt connected to them. I really cared about them and what would happen in their lives, especially Julia and her sister, Livvy. Not every author can make you feel that way about her (or his) characters. I\u2019m debating whether I want to try any of the friendship bread recipes in the back of the book. My seventeen-year-old daughter recently commented that maybe she should be a \u201cbaker\u201d some day, so she might enjoy trying it with me, and there\u2019s a recipe for \u201cDouble Chocolate Friendship Bread\u201d. Kind of hard to pass that up! Overall, I really enjoyed this book, and I\u2019ll be eagerly awaiting the sequel. In the meantime, I looked up the author on Fantastic Fiction, and she has three other books under the name Mia King \u2013 Good Things, Sweet Life, and Table Manners.

Such a sweet story about a small town, a tragic event and a simple act of baking that brings a town together. I'd give it 4 stars, but I did tire a bit of the non-stop talk about the friendship bread. I thought there were a few too many stories about people receiving the starter and baking the bread. They were scattered throughout the book and interrupted the main storyline too much.

Friendship Bread is the novel before The Avalon Ladies Scrapbooking Society and introduces us readers to Avalon and Madeline Davis and her Tea Salon before her establishment became the town's hub.It all starts with an elderly man. A man who knows and loves his neighbors. One neighbor is Julia Evarts. She hardly ever leaves her house any more. The house is no longer a home. The joy died five years ago with her son, Josh. But an unexpected gift of an Amish Friendship Bread Starter and loaf will lead Julia back to the land of the living and will also transform both her and Avalon in many ways.Hannah, Madeline, and Julia are wonderful characters.

The story follows the lives of five women, all at different painful areas of life and all of them struggling alone from the weight of the pain they are going through. One day, Julia comes home to find a plate with a loaf of bread, and a recipe for friendship bread. Her five-year-old daughter Gracie pleads for her to make the recipe because she wanted her daddy to try some of it. And in 10 days, Julia is left with bags of starter and sends them to school with Gracie. What happens is an epidemic of friendship bread. While the bread is a sweet spot in the story, the pain and grief the women and families that are the focus of the story is not. Ms. Gee has written this story so well that the reader feels the pain and heartache of each character. The reader cannot help but cry, feel hope, smile, laugh, and cry some more while reading 'friendship bread'. This is one of my new favorite books and having the recipes to play with is just an added bonus. I have chosen for my book club to read Friendship Bread this fall."}, {"userName": "Stacy", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1911526-stacy", "userReview": "I can't really say I didn't like it because I never finished it. There are too many GOOD books out there so I decided not to sit through this mediocre one. (I'm possibly being unfair since I recently read some really good stories just before trying this out.) For me, a good book grabs you right from the start and never lets you go until you reach that last page. When you have to get up and do something else, you find yourself still thinking about what's going on, and you do whatever it takes to be able to get back to it to find out what happens next. It probably got better after the spot where I called it quits, but for me it was a sleeper, and really did put me to sleep. I did not relate with any of the characters and never once came anywhere close to losing myself in the story (which is one way I measure a novel's worth.)From the cover, it looks inviting! And usually I really CAN judge a book by its cover.

The book appears to be one that will be pleasant to read. It is about love, friendship, relationships and all the myriad things that can happen to someone in their lives, both good and bad. The author speaks in a charming, simple tone and makes you feel right at home, just like the friendship bread which seems to be at the core of the story, the theme that ties it all together.It is an easy book to read, perhaps more like a beach read. Although it seems like a very \u201clight\u201d book, written very simplistically, it imparts a message about friendship which is open to many interpretations. If we explore how each of us thinks we go about making friends or what each of us considers to be the meaning of friendship or commitment, we could probably have a very lively discussion!Although it is not a book of great depth, and some of the characters are a bit weak and shallow, I would not dismiss it. It tackles so many subjects that have great depth: death of a child, death of a husband, divorce, estrangement in families, infidelity, pregnancy, ambition, self-respect and relationships in general etc. It is because of that, that I believe it would be a marvelous book to discuss in a group.Julia has lost a child, Hannah, a former concert cellist, is going through a divorce, Madeline, the elderly owner of the town tea shop, is suffering from her own period of adjustment and loneliness after the death of her husband, Livvy is estranged from her sister and she and her husband are having deep financial difficulties. And then there is Edie (unmarried, living with the town doctor), the reporter who exposes the Friendship Bread to the world and with it hurt several people in the process. She struck an angry nerve within me. Consumed with self interest, she writes her story, and instead of emphasizing the goodness of the effort, she emphasizes the negatives in an attempt to gain fame for herself and play \u201cgotcha\u201d with someone\u2019s life without thinking about the consequences of the act she has committed. She is a caricature of today\u2019s journalist, willing to do anything to get the story, regardless of whether or not the facts are stretched or even real. Another character who tries to throw a monkey wrench into other people\u2019s lives is Vivian. She is an over ambitious, unhappy woman who will stop at nothing to get ahead. She doesn\u2019t respect the bonds of marriage, the protocols of her office or the boundaries imposed by its hierarchy and has an overblown idea of her own importance.Oddly, I felt as if the men in the story were portrayed softer, weaker perhaps, at times, but more human too; as characters they seemed filled with positive energy and were definitely without the emotional excesses of many of the women cast in the novel. They seemed put upon by life, innocent in the whirlwind that engulfed them while the women seemed to be more the cause of their own problems because of their own weaknesses or insecurities.There are several extraneous characters whose stories suddenly appear without any serious development. Some of the characters seem like caricatures of themselves, and often, the dialog is trite and the situations seem over used. That said: the redeeming feature of the book is its ability to empathize with, and also illustrate, the issues that confront all of us today, in one way or another. Also, it is a fairy tale and who doesn\u2019t like a fairy tale with a happy ending?"}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4877728-melissa", "userReview": "***Please note: This book was received as a free ARC copy. Obtained through the Goodreads First Reads program***This book was entirely charming and definitely one of those feel good types of books. While its probably not a classic or masterpiece, in its own way its just as good as any of those types of books. Maybe I'm biased because I love food and heartwarming stories, but I think this book rates five stars easily. For those not familiar with Friendship Bread, it is a fermented starter that is lovingly cared for for 10 days, and then split into four with the owner keeping one to bake and three to give away and keep the starter circulating. If you've ever been the recipient of a starter you know it makes awesome bread, but gets a bit overwhelming at times.There are many characters and happenings in this book but one thing remains solid; friendship bread is the primary character in this novel. From Julia, who has been in a deep depression ever since her son died to Hannah, a talented cellist who is going through a separation with her husband, friendship bread changes the outlook of each of these women and helps them be strong on their own. They find solace in each other and at Madeline's tea shop, where the kindly Madeline plys them with baked goods and friendship. There is also Edie, who is desperately wanting to report on a good story and who is lukewarm on accepting advances of friendship from Livvy (who happens to be Julia's estranged sister). There are several other characters short stories as well in the novel that are used to show how the friendship bread starter is being passed around town. While the story has much to do about delicious food and the bread itself, it is more wrapped around the people that make the small town so unique.The characters in this book are wonderfully and all delightfully real. They have their flaws and make mistakes, but they strive to work through them. They just seem very human in a wonderful sort of way. I especially was enchanted with Madeline, the owner of the tea shop, because she seemed like someone I would be friends with and real life and she could cook some fabulous sounding dishes.The writing was good. I'm not a fan of the tense Gee used but after awhile I was able to ignore it and really get into the story. In fact, I could barely put the book down I enjoyed it so much. It is an easy story to read and filled with emotion, friendship and love. There's nothing offensive in the writing and any age groups would be fine for this novel. The pace is done well in addition and I was glad to see that Gee included an epilogue for the readers to follow up on the story and characters. It was a pleasant surprise.I'm very pleased that I got a chance to read this book. I would definitely read other books by Gee and will be on the lookout for more works from her. I highly recommend this book; especially to those who love food and cooking books.Friendship BreadCopyright 2011363 pages + recipes and tipsReview by M.

I loved it!Friendship Bread was an absolute delight to read. Having grown up in a small town, the atmosphere captured on the page was so realistic. From the descriptions of the attitudes towards those new to the town complete to the feelings of never wanting to leave because you are a part of something bigger. The characters were witty and so well created. There were times you could see there the plot was heading and instead of it being a moment when you are ready to put the book down, I found myself pushing them or pulling for them and cheering as it all came together.Being a personal victim of a Amish Friend Bread outbreak, I can attest to the realism of the fear and loathing in people's faces when you are seen with a starter in your hand, even if decorated nicely. I loved the solution of what to do with all of the starter and the way it brought the community and families back together.As much as I loved the rest of the book, my favorite part might be the Prologue and Epilogue. It wraps the story up in a beautiful ribbon.

The story is a chain letter metaphor of one good deed blossoming into many more. The book started out slowly, as there were so many characters to keep straight, but as I did, the story just grew (similar to the bread).

She blames her sister for his death so they have become estranged. Her husband loves her with all his heart but while dealing with his own grief their marriage seems to be falling apart right before their eyes.Then one day as Julia arrives home with her daughter they find a plate on their porch with a sample of a wonderful bread along with a bag of Amish Friendship Starter Batter with detailed instructions. Julia probably would have thrown it away but her daughter was so excited they decided to give the bread a try.This ziploc bag of starter starts a whole phenomenon is the small town of Avalon, Illinois. It helps Julia start to heal, and she makes friends with two other ladies who are new to Avalon, each with their own problems and stories. As these friendships grow so does the effect of the friendship bread. One small bag of batter brings us a story of love, loss, and friendship. It also brings a community together in a way that is unimaginable.I remember this starter and recipe being passed around here several years ago but it didn't have the same effect here as it does in this book. If people saw you carrying a bag of batter they stopped and started walking the opposite direction.I have to say that after reading this book I was wishing our experience could have been more like the one in Avalon. This book was as much of a treat as the bread it is based on. It is not a book to be rushed through but a story to savored. There are a lot of times where you stop to think maybe we are missing something in our rushed, hurry up, technical lives of today. True friendships today can become rare because we are all being pulled in different directions, with our jobs, our kids events, school or the many other things that snatch us away from taking time for ourselves. I was wishing for a tea shop like the one in the book, where these women gathered and had time to build forever relationships with each other. The truly took lemons and turned them into lemonade or batter and turned it into such tasty treats.Darien Gee's words were just a pleasure to read. She had me laughing one minute and tears in my eyes the next. This is an engaging story that should not be missed by anyone who loves Woman's Fiction. Can a loaf of bread fix all the wrongs in the world, repair broken families, bring old friends back together and add more friends to enrich our lives? No, but it definitely started those things in motion in this wonderful story.There are several recipes included in the book. There are Facebook pages and websites dedicated to Amish Friendship Bread. One of them says \"This is more than a recipe it is a way of thinking.\" That is shown completely is this story. Thank you Darien for writing a beautiful story with a wealth of insight and about the true warmth of friendship.

I was a few years out of High School and really into the Amish. My Mother brought home a starter bag of this bread in the form of dough. We left it on the counter and let it ferment, and baked it on the 10 day mark. It was SO delicious! Then, that was it. I didn't hear about it again until lately, since this book came out! I first saw this book on an online Book Blog. I made the Starter Recipe from there. I went back to the site to get the recipe to bake it 10 days later. They were talking more about the book, and then I saw there was an online Social Page about this book as well. I was HOOKED! I HAD to buy this book! I came to Amazon to purchase it on my Kindle because I couldn't wait to get it!! I HAD to have it NOW! I thought it would be a book full of recipes, but no! It is a novel that takes place in Avalon, Illinois, where 5 different characters/families are involved in giving and receiving the Starter Recipe, a Starter Bag of Dough, and a Loaf of this Amish Friendship Bread. It connects all the characters together with some really neat stories! My favorite story was about the Police Officer who found a bag of the Starter Mix with one of the characters! He was going to send it to the Lab to have them figure out 'what is this thing?'. I was roaring! This is the only book I have purchased that takes a recipe about a loaf of bread, and weaves it into a novel! A GREAT novel, at that! SO creative! I was SO surprised when I started reading this book! Here I was, expecting a book FULL of recipes, and it IS a novel! A WONDERFUL heart-warming novel! In the back of the book there are many different varieties of recipes you can choose from to bake! So the author DOES provide you with some! There is still the Book Blog that has recipes for this bread as well as the Social Networking site still available! I hope they keep that up so we can all continue to share recipes for this bread! I am keeping my starter going! I have handed it out to ALL my friends now, and am looking for MORE recipes so I can continue to use my starters every 10 days! Some of the recipes can be used right away, such as for pancakes! I HIGHLY recommend this book to people who LOVE to bake! I can't cook well, but I CAN bake! This bread is SO delicious, too! The story alone is wonderful!

Ms. Gee does a wonderful job presenting the lives of the people of Avalon and the challenges each person faces. I love how the friendship bread is almost like a 10 step therapy process as it helps and heals. I received this book from Random House in anticipation of it's April release. My full review as seen on MoanaSaves.com is copied below.(http://www.moanasaves.com/2011/03/fri...)Have you heard of (or tasted) Amish Friendship Bread? The cinnamon bread/cake is made from a sourdough starter and is often shared with others in a way similar to a chain letter. Darien Gee's new novel entitled Friendship Bread tells the story of Julia Evarts and how one simple loaf of bread changed her life and eventually the lives of those in her community.I'm a pleasure reader when it comes to books. Every now and then I find a really good book and reading it is like a good chat with an old friend. This book hits that nail on the head! Here are a few of the reasons I enjoyed this book:* The book is \"Dedicated to the Mothers.\" I love this! I related to so many parts of this story. As a wife and mother I laughed and cried right along with the female characters.* The story is current and personal with references to the economy and local natural disasters. Regardless of where you call home we can all relate to job layoffs or ill weather that affect us or our loved ones.* Recipes are included in the back! I've made Amish Friendship Bread but never any of these variations: banana nut, butterscotch, double chocolate, lemon poppy seed, pineapple macadamia nut, pistachio cherry, pumpkin cranberry or zucchini. I especially want to try the Chocolate Caramel Brownies made from the friendship bread starter.* Friendship bread starter takes 10 days to ferment. While reading the book I liked to compare the 10 day process to an extended therapy session. I knew if one character had a trial and they had also received a bread starter that I could keep reading with confidence and by the time they baked their bread they were well on the road to solving their problems. * The biggest lesson learned for me while reading this novel was Madeline's words of advice on a particularly bad day. In short, her words were that the unexpected turns make life rich. This is a great reminder to me that when the going gets tough those are the moments that define who I am and who I'm becoming."}, {"userName": "Brandy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/936713-brandy", "userReview": "I won this book through first reads and I am delighted that I get to give it a positive review!My rating would probably be closer to 3.5 stars than 4 but the message of the story pushed me to 4 since I couldn't choose 3.5.As I was reading this book and even shortly after I was slightly disappointed that this book didn't give me more. I just wanted it to be deeper. Half way through I was thinking \"where is the meat\"?Now that it has been a couple days since I have read it I realized it had everything I needed. The story is about a small town in northern Illinois. One day a bag of friendship starter is found on the porch of Julia, who has a tragic background, and is struggling with depression. At the prodding of Gracie, her daughter she reluctantly feeds the starter and sends extra bags off to school with Gracie to give away to friends.The friendship starter grows to be almost an epidemic. Gee beautifully weaves the story of the starter with the stories of ladies living in the town with their own set of problems. I think that Gee did a wonderful job at character development and I truly felt I could relate with each of the ladies as I got to know them.The thing I loved about this book is that as we follow a simple friendship bread starter we also see that truly it is by small and simple means that great things are brought to pass. Friendships are made and lives are changed. I especially loved the subtle message that it is only when we are serving others that our own problems melt away. This book is one that has caused me to think and reflect on my own life more than I expected it to and because of that I realized that even though this book appears to be \"simple\" at first glance, it truly is great. I am so glad that I was able to read an advanced copy and I would highly recommend getting this book when it is available. This would be a great book club read.

My only hope is that this is not the last we will see of the town of Avalon. The only downfall of the book? I spent a lot of time trying to prevent late night snacking! One word: Awesome. (and highly, HIGHLY recommended but that is way more then one word)Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to start my first, well, starter!"}, {"userName": "Sarah Ford", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3588295-sarah-ford", "userReview": "I read this book quickly. It was a cozy story, and one that drew me in quickly and flowed easily. If you are looking for an easy girlie book, in the Sophie Kinsella/Jill Mansell (except American) tradition, one that goes well with a rainy day curled up on the couch, then FRIENDSHIP BREAD should fit the bill nicely. There is a sad premise to the story--a family that has been struggling with the loss of child--which I want to put out there in case this would not be a good time to immerse yourself in that, but I will say that I believe Darien Gee wrote about that topic in a way that is sensitive and appropriate. Though there is that dark subject and others, the overall tone of the book is one of levity, with themes of empowerment and healing through community. I look forward to the rest of the Avalon series. By the way, I made the Friendship Bread starter on Tuesday. The book tells you how, and includes many recipes for when it comes time to bake! I'll be bringing some for my book club meeting next Wednesday."}, {"userName": "Galleane", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7200372-galleane", "userReview": "La saveur de l'amiti\u00e9 est un joli roman doudou.
