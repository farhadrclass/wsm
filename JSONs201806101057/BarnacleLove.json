What a debut! My only quibble is that it is supposedly a book of linked stories, but I don\u2019t think it can be read in any way except as a novel, which I did, in one sitting. The story is split into two parts. Part I, titled Terra Nova, focuses on Manuel Antonio Rebelo. Against his mother\u2019s wishes, Manuel travels from his Portuguese village to Canada. \u201cI need to go. I need to be part of a bigger world. I need to know if there\u2019s room for me out there.\u201d What follows is pain, sorrow, anger, love, and a whole host of other emotions, all so sensitively written that the reader easily absorbs each while being swept into the Portuguese community experience of life in Toronto, where they keep their own traditions and ceremonies alive. Part II, Caged Birds Sing, focuses on Antonio, Manuel\u2019s son. We read of Antonio\u2019s difficulties being a child of immigrant parents, and being taunted by schoolmates for being foreign. At heart, Barnacle Love is the story about the relationship between Manuel and Antonio; the disappointments in the choices made by Manuel, and his expectations for Antonio. It all rings so true, I couldn\u2019t help but think that Anthony De Sa wrote, at least in part, about his own experience.I highly recommend reading this book, and to read it chronologically. Each story builds on the last, moving through the slow decline of Manuel and his family. Yes, it a sad story, but it is filled with a sort of poetic truth. And I suppose the ending was inevitable, but\u2026Well, read the story; find out for yourself."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "I kind of liked this book, but it just isn't all that great, contrary to the Scotiabank shortlist it boasts."}, {"userName": "Teddy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/271544-teddy", "userReview": "This is my first book read for the Canadian Book Challenge.Please see my review on either Amazon.ca or my blog.

Some of the book was deeply moving, with rich detail and feeling and other parts were disengaged and terribly slow paced. I found De Sa's writing to be unreliable. The tone and flow of the novel would change even within the same \"phases\" of the story. You could almost read the days he wasn't having a good day at work and had rather been golfing. Whole passages read like he was just putting in the work to get the pages filled, where others were vibrant and moving and absorbing. There was so much good going on with this book that I wanted to love it. Again, some of the writing was so wonderful I practically gobbled it up. I thought the change in narration was a great way to see the \"Canadian Dream\" through the different generations' eyes and I thought it was brilliant that with the change in narration came a great change in the character Manuel and how I, the reader felt about him. However, I felt I was being a little left out of the book at times. I think the big sweeps forward in time with no detail about the in-between was supposed to mimic how life just goes along and all of a sudden you find years have passed ... I think. I felt, though, it didn't quite work and that I just wasn't being kept up to speed; I was missing some pretty big details about what happened in all that time that passed. Also, there was use of imagery that seemed to be given a lot of importance at the beginning of the story that just seemed to get dropped throughout the course of the book. For instance, the big fish was a beautiful image used when Manuel was young to express his dreams and it went absolutely no where. If there had been a meaningful passage about how the fish became inconsequential or unvaluable to Manuel, it would have made sense in the story. However, it just disappeared, no reason given. I felt the same way when Manuel confronted the priest who'd abused him. For something that was so huge in his life, I would've liked a little information on the aftermath and how Manuel was feeling about it! There were quite a few instances like this in the story from Manuel's marriage to his mother's death to Antonio's feelings about the boy murdered in the neighbourhood. Even the term barnacle love and the ending of the novel seemed kind of slapped in there. I think De Sa is a talented writer and Barnacle Love was a brilliant idea that seemed either a little hurried or maybe not fleshed out fully, so despite it's many wonderful parts, it just didn't quite work."}, {"userName": "Jim Fonseca", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca", "userReview": "A story of a Portuguese immigrant from the Azores islands to the Portuguese Community in St. John's, Newfoundland and then to Toronto. It's actually two stories - one of the father and one of the son. We compare the life of the immigrant father from a dirt-poor rural village where the only escape is to go to sea fishing, and the son who grows up in urban Toronto. The father struggles to maintain some of his traditional values; the son struggles to find any values. The writing is excellent (blurb by Colm Toibin) and is as much a collection of interrelated short stories as a novel. The Portuguese do whatever they have to do to survive: frugal rural life tending crops and animals; fishing for cod in an isolated dory in deadly seas, or being a custodian in urban Toronto. Like Home Is an Island: A Novel (Portuguese in the Americas Series) by Alfred Lewis, Saudade by Katherine Vaz and The Undiscovered Island (Portuguese in the Americas Series) by Darrell Kastin, this book is a part of the growing and excellent literature by Azoreans in the United States and Canada."}, {"userName": "Lisa Furtado", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2375631-lisa-furtado", "userReview": "I am first generation Canadian, my parents are from the Azores.

He eventually settles in Canada and begins a life there.Part Two , leaping ahead about 15 years, is then narrated by Manuel's son, Antonio, who chronicles the difficulties of being a child of an immigrant along with capturing his father's descent into alcoholism and bitterness. It is very sad to witness the breakdown of Manuel and his family. It was interesting to me though to read about the kids' struggles in being children of immigrants. Those of you who are children of first generation immigrants like me can relate to specific bothers like having to interpret for family at a bank or on the phone when someone calls,and being sent to school with a traditional portuguese lunch when all the other kids were eating peanut butter sandwiches on wonder bread..and just wanting so badly to be like all the other american kids. Also, only a child of an immigrant can really understand what is is like to be pushed by your parents to accomplish the dreams they were never able to accomplish. It is a whole different subculture...many books have focused on the experiences of immigrants, but few have actually dived into the children of those immigrants and how they fare. I feel this book definately got into that. The book is written beautifully. I have read that it is a collection of short stories that can stand alone, however, each story is linked chronologically and I would not recommend reading it any other way than reading it like a novel. I loved all the Portuguese language inserted throughout the book, but if the reader is not Portuguese, they will not only not understand everything but also miss a lot of the nuances of the Portuguese culture. I also feel that it will no be appealing to most who are not immigrants or children of immigrants. I also loved how the book captured the Azorean culture..something i have found done this well only in one other book that i have read. (Leaving Pico by Frank Gaspar). The customs, the sayings, the family bonds and that Portuguese spirit of doing whatever it takes to survive. I wish I could find more books like this. Funny how when you read about immigrants, they do everything in their power to leave their country and start over in the US or Canada to follow their dreams, yet when I read a book like this i feel SAUDADE. It really makes me want to take another trip to my parents homeland and go back to where my family's roots grow deep."}, {"userName": "Teena in Toronto", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481874-teena-in-toronto", "userReview": "It's the 1950s in Portugal. As the oldest son, Manuel's mother has high hopes for him. Manual wants to leave his small village and experience the world so he gets a job on a fishing boat which will take him off the coast of Newfoundland. Despite the guilt that he feels about leaving his family and disappointing his mother, he settles in Canada and looks forward to the endless possibilities and making something of himself.Fast forward and it's the 1970s and Manuel is now married, living in Toronto and has two children. They \"live\" in the Palmerston/Queen Street W area ... just east of my 'hood so I knew a lot of the landmarks mentioned. Though they (and the rest of his family) are now living in Toronto, they still have the same traditions from home such as butchering pigs in garages and making their own wine. None of Manuel's dreams have come true and he sees himself as a failure. He wants to make sure that same doesn't happen to his children. But the same pressures his mother put on him, he is putting on his son, Antonio. It was sad to see that optimistic Manuel had turned into bitter Manuel.This is the second book I've read by this author. I had read Kicking the Sky (written in 2013) a couple years go, which took an experience from Barnacle Love and expanded on it. It's a sad depressing story. I found the writing a bit draggy in places and it could have been tighter. It a bit confusing at times as the author jumped back and forth in time a bit. Manuel's story in the 1950s (the first part of the book) was written in third person perspective and Antonio's story in the 1970s is written in first person perspective from Antonio's point of view. I found this a bit confusing too until I figured out whose voice it was.Except for Antonio, I didn't find the characters likeable. Everyone let Manuel get away with being just a jerk for so long. He had so much yet couldn't see it. Like Antonio, I kept wondering why his mother hadn't left.I wasn't crazy about the ending.

I\u2019m not sure why it took me this long to read it, but this week I became curious and decided to give it a try. Honestly, I expected more. Here are my thoughts:* I liked the Portuguese words interwoven into the text, especially m\u00e3e and filho\u2014words that transmit emotions that can never be translated. (Of course, there was also saudade, but that in itself has become a LusoAmerican writer clich\u00e9.) * Speaking of clich\u00e9s, I did not like the abused by a priest plotline. * Although I enjoyed the beginning of the book, I started to lose interest in Manuel as the story progressed. I was annoyed by the jumps in the narrative and was sometimes unsure when exactly things were happening. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly how Manuel became the man he became, and I\u2019d like to know more about the process. The second part of the book, the story of Manuel\u2019s son Antonio, I liked because it is the story of many people I know, the children of immigrants who have to find a balance between two countries and two homes. * One random pet peeve: I find it hard to believe that this Azorian town was really as backwards as he makes it seem. I mean, it was the 60s and 70s! Were the islands living in a different world from the mainland(?) because things were not like that at all in my tiny town in northern Portugal. * I expected more from the title \u201cBarnacle Love\u201d\u2014I kept waiting for it to make a comeback in the narrative. Sure, there was a subtle allusion in the second to last story; but I think it was really too subtle. Also, I would have liked to see more emphasis placed on the Big Lips imagery (I hesitate to call it symbolism). Like barnacle love, big lips also never made his way back into the story. * And, lastly, why must contemporary books about Portugal (or the Portuguese in diaspora) incorporate some aspect of magical realism? (I understand that this is done in the tradition of Jose Saramago, Antonio Lobo Antunes, Lidia Jorge, etc. but it\u2019s time to try something new.)

In order to establish your sense of place a person must be prepared to have their dreams delayed, deferred, and, upon occasion, both themselves and their dreams destroyed. Some people never will find the secret and the definition of home.The first part of this novel, written in two sections, is the story of Manuel Rebelo who chooses to leave his home in the Azores to find a new world and a new home in Canada. From a near death off the coast of Newfoundland, to a thwarted attempt to find love, Manuel finds that the new world does not allow an easy entry for his new life.The second, and more extensive part of the novel is the story of Antonio, his son, who, being born in Canada has the opportunity to begin his life in Canada. It is at this point that De Sa's true skill and perceptive eye combine to give the novel its centre and its strength. Manuel and his family live in the Little Portugal district of Toronto. Here, safe from the outside world of Canada and Canadians, in the alleys, streets and shops of Little Portugal, Antonio wrestles with what it is like to be torn between the old culture of his father, and the new world, just a bicycle ride away. De Sa's keen eye effectively depicts the nuances, eccentricities and lifestyle as well as the clashes of the old ways and new cultures found teeming in the streets of Toronto.The novel ends, symbolically and effectively in that most symbolic and tacky of places, Niagara Falls, on New year's Eve. As that time of year suggests, it is out with the old and in with the new, but what happens, and how it happens, is of course, for you to discover."}, {"userName": "Douglas Lord", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22117564-douglas-lord", "userReview": "The only fitting description of this is \"lyrical.\" Now, I like literary fiction, and I like occasional lyricism (by George Gershwin, for example), but I don't usually go full-out on the lyric front. This is a wonderful, evocative, and quiet read, but there are no explosions, no murders. There are no car chases or graphic sex. In fact, plot seems secondary to mood. De Sa presents a few determined family members bumping up against each other and finding stuff out about themselves. Nothing much really \"happens.\" After his fisherman father drowns, a Portuguese boy named Manuel is groomed by his mom to be...a fisherman. He secretly strives for more and winds up skipping out on the setup. We get a glimmer of his strength and resolve when he returns to bury his mom, but when the story picks up with his own son, we see that he has grown up to be, essentially, nothing-a variant of his own father. Meanwhile, sailors play accordions, angels ride in the back of a dump truck, and a family trip to Niagara Falls goes awry. De Sa shows that a family can interconnect not only with place and circumstance but also sensibility.

The first portion follows Manuel from his boyhood into his adulthood as he struggles with the expectations of his mother for greatness on the island of Sao Miguel, Acores, and his dream of seeing the wider world and eventually settling in Canada. Unlike his brothers and sisters, Manuel\u2019s light hair and blue eyes reminded his mother of her husband, who was lost at sea. Effectively, he becomes her substitute companion and weighs him down with her expectations until he finally breaks free to live his dreams. Unfortunately, he finds that his dreams are not so easily realized.\u201cManuel used his forearms to part the stalks of corn. His blood coursed through him. He forged ahead, swiping at the brittle stems, nursing the anger that had pressed on him ever since he had arrived back home and Silvia had said no.\u201d (page 97)De Sa uses a fast-paced narrative intertwined with folklore, tradition, and imagery to paint a picture of Manuel\u2019s life, his homeland, and his new home in a way that they become almost surreal. Is this man truly living his life here or is this his dream/nightmare made real. Once Antonio takes over the narrative, the nightmare grows more surreal as family members become more like caricatures rather than people.Read the full review: http://savvyverseandwit.com/2010/09/b..."}, {"userName": "Leya", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16464075-leya", "userReview": "I inhaled this book in one sitting! Once I began reading it, I couldn't put it down. I was swept into someplace very familiar to me. As a Portuguese Canadian I can identify with so much that the author has written.The book is divided into two parts. The first half is narrated by Manuel. Manuel is the apple of his mother's eye, the one she hopes that will succeed in life, the one that will be important in their small village in Sao Miguel, Acores, Portugal. But Manuel has his own dreams, he doesn't want what his mother so dearly wants for me. He signs up to be a fisherman in a big ship, which brings him north, where in a freak accident he washes up on the coast of Newfoundland. A series of events leave him confused and angry, the hope that always had seems to be diminishing. He soon feels like his dreams are all slipping through his fingers.The second is narrated by Antonio, Manuel's son. Like his mother before him, Manuel has high hopes and dreams for Antonio. For Antonio growing up in Little Portugal in Toronto is a confusing time. It like being caught between the old ways of the old country with a new ways of the new country. Which I completely understand, very well. I know the feeling of going to school and kids asking me if I ate fish all the time, or being sent traditional Portuguese dish for lunch but just wanting to fit in by having a Wonder bread sandwich.

The structure of linked stories enables the reader to commit to the characters, knowing they will reappear throughout the narrative. I found it hard to identify with either of the main characters however: Manuel in the first half and Antonio in the second half. I don't need to LIKE characters in order to appreciate a book but I do need to be able to connect to them in some way.I was intrigued by the immigrant experience from the Portuguese point of view, the intermingling of language and customs between the old world and the new. It's a theme ubiquitous in CanLit--the immigrant experience--but the Catholic Portuguese family trying to make a home in wild odd Newfoundland was new to me and I found De Sa's portrayal very engaging.Finally, I was able to identify with the father/son relationship in the second book. The reader can sympathize with Antonio as he struggles to cope with his alcoholic father. He and his sister have very different ways of relating to their father and this rings true.

I lost interest in the second half of the book narrated by his son - seemed like a tale that I've heard many times before describing immigrant experiences, loss of dreams, etc. Short-listed for the Giller Prize 2008."}, {"userName": "Irene", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16277861-irene", "userReview": "It was an interesting collection of interrelated short stories. Since the stories skip ahead in time and change perspectives, there's a lot that's left unexplained. I was hoping to learn more about Manuel's \"failures\" in the new world. For someone who started off so driven to succeed, it's difficult to understand how he became an alcoholic based on the information provided in the short stories."}], "description": "Shortlisted for the 2008 Scotiabank Giller PrizeLike Wayson Choy and David Bezmozgis before him, Anthony De Sa captures, in stories brimming with life, the innocent dreams and bitter disappointments of the immigrant experience.At the heart of this collection of intimately linked stories is the relationship between a father and his son. A young fisherman washes up nearly dead on the shores of Newfoundland. It is Manuel Rebelo who has tried to escape the suffocating smallness of his Portuguese village and the crushing weight of his mother\u2019s expectations to build a future for himself in a terra nova. Manuel struggles to shed the traditions of a village frozen in time and to silence the brutal voice of Maria Theresa da Conceicao Rebelo, but embracing the promise of his adopted land is not as simple as he had hoped.Manuel\u2019s son, Antonio, is born into Toronto\u2019s little Portugal, a world of colourful houses and labyrinthine back alleys. In the Rebelo home the Church looms large, men and women inhabit sharply divided space, pigs are slaughtered in the garage, and a family lives in the shadow cast by a father\u2019s failures. Most days Antonio and his friends take to their bikes, pushing the boundaries of their neighbourhood street by street, but when they finally break through to the city beyond they confront dangers of a new sort.With fantastic detail, larger-than-life characters and passionate empathy, Anthony De Sa invites readers into the lives of the Rebelos and finds there both the promise and the disappointment inherent in the choices made by the father and the expectations placed on the son.", "title": "Barnacle Love", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2454933.Barnacle_Love", "average": 3.26, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320502969l/2454933.jpg", "reviews": 54, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1092091.Anthony_De_Sa", "name": "Anthony De Sa"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Short Stories"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2454933.Barnacle_Love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7915141-barnacle-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5161376-barnacle-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15792510-kicking-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20948343-kicking-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6144063-the-scotiabank-giller-prize-15-years", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29630823-nem-c-nem-l"]}
