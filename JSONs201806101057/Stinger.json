With the entire book taking place over the course of one night, it's a great example of the horror being written during that time. This is the story of a duel alien invasion-one alien crashed on earth due to a ship malfunction, (Daufin) and the other a bounty-hunter come to track the first one down, (Stinger). All of this takes place in the town of Inferno, in west Texas. With a variety of small town characters putting aside their differences to unite against Stinger, the universal theme of good vs. evil comes into play. The shape-shifting abilities, (for lack of a better word), of Stinger allow it to take over host bodies and bend them to its will, making this a more interesting tale than it otherwise would have been. I think it also must have been quite challenging for the narrator of this audiobook. The narration here took me a while to get used to, most especially during scenes where there was a lot of action. At first, I wasn't sure if I would make it through the entire way, (Stinger is 500+ pages long), but I did become accustomed to it and began to enjoy it thoroughly. This is my third time reading STINGER and I think it's possible I might read it again in the future. Sure it's infused with a lot of 80's pop culture and lingo, (all the good looking girls are smash-foxes), but that was a special time for me, and for the horror genre, so I have no problem with that.Also, I think it's possible that STINGER has influenced a lot of authors, (it's difficult not to see a connection to King's UNDER THE DOME), whether they were conscious of it or not. STINGER was a lot of fun to listen to and Nick Sullivan did a fairly good job of bringing it all home in a fun way. If you're looking for many hours of listening enjoyment and alien invasion action, STINGER is the book for you!*Thank you to the narrator for the free Audible edition in exchange for my honest feedback. This is it.*"}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "The town of Inferno has been slowly dying since the copper mine went bust. The school is closing for good in two days. Most people are leaving town and the two gangs, The Rattlesnakes and the Renegades, are like vultures on Inferno's corpse. Everything gets turned upside down the day an alien ship crashes and the alien takes over the body of a little girl. It's a picnic, however, compared to the second alien that shows up...Stinger is the story of a dying town turned upside down by two aliens. Just as he did in Swan Song, McCammon creates an ensemble cast that grips the imagination. Cody Lockett and Rick Jurado, leaders of the Renegades and the Rattlesnakes, were both three dimensional characters and neither were scene-chewing villains. The rest of the cast was also well done, the Hammond family in particular. Even Vance, the douche bag sheriff, and Curt Lockett, Cody's alcoholic father, ended up not being all bad.The aliens were pretty interesting. Daufin was an artificial intelligence contained in a black sphere and Stinger, well, Stinger was complicated, parts man, scorpion, and other components. The story was fast-paced, especially after Stinger showed up, and reminded me of the movies The Predator and Tremors at times. No one knows when Stinger will strike but he always comes from below ground. One thing I found funny was that Stinger's ship surrounded the town with an impenetrable dome seven miles in diameter, cutting off the power and supplies. McCammon gets a lot of flack for being a Stephen King wannabee but he beat old Steve to the punch by over twenty years with the dome concept.The ending was believable and done well. Not everyone survived and you got the idea that Inferno would never be the same.Stinger was a page-turner and shouldn't be missed by horror fans. It's gory and really intense at times."}, {"userName": "Dirk Grobbelaar", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3102740-dirk-grobbelaar", "userReview": "Deep down, in the centre of the blackness, something might have shifted\u2014a cautious, slow stirring; an ancient thing, contemplating the shine of light that touched it through the murk. Then it was still again, pondering and gathering strength.McCammon takes some time to set up his story and his characters. This is one of the aspects I enjoy about Horror novels like these; it\u2019s quite the immersive experience. On the other hand, I didn\u2019t care much for the whole Renegades vs Rattlesnakes gang war thing; it felt forced and unnatural in the setting, and just a little bit cheesy. But then\u2026 [Her] face had begun to bleach of colour, taking on a waxy, greyish cast. Her legs had started trembling, and she whispered it again: \u201cSting-er.\u201dAnd in that whisper was the sound of utter terror.\u2026enter Stinger in spectacular fashion. Things go downhill fast from here, in the best possible kind of way. The shape came out of the smoke and lurched into the candlelight that streamed from the church\u2019s windows.Stinger isn\u2019t a very subtle novel. The horror that it dishes up is rather gory and unabashedly in-your-face, with some rather interesting descriptive prose to nudge things along. In broad strokes, the Stinger of the title is in fact an Alien critter that terrorises a small Texas town, much like the synopsis will lead you to expect. There is, however, a lot more than that lying just beneath the surface (no pun intended), and the plot was a little more layered than I had anticipated.What had sounded like an army was only one creature, but the sight of such an ungodly thing speared terror through [him]. He felt as if his insides were shrivelling.Stinger doesn\u2019t break a lot of new ground (again, no pun intended), and you could conceivable draw comparisons with other 80s horror novels where the antagonist manifests itself in different forms, although the scientific spin McCammon introduces here does at least attempt to make some sense of what would otherwise have been a lot of metaphysical weirdness. This is where the novel differentiates itself from the pack.The story does get pretty scary, but it\u2019s also somewhat relentless with lots of close encounters and chase scenes that, even though it will leave you with palpitations, does slightly blunt the spook factor. I really enjoyed it though, and could have considered a five star rating, but, like I\u2019ve already mentioned, the \u201cgang\u201d dynamic (rattlers vs \u2018gades) wasn\u2019t quite to my taste and I can\u2019t help but feel that the novel would have been a better one without it.Recommended for fans of 80s Horror and SF Horror.He stood up, in no hurry, and walked toward her with the knife upraised and the merry shine of madness in his eyes."}, {"userName": "Paul O'Neill", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17331573-paul-o-neill", "userReview": "Holy Stinger, this was unbelievably good!

It's the only time where I've seen 'mind hopping' done effectively - It all takes place within 24 hours and is non stop - Did I mention it's creepy as all hell??A must read for all horror fans and those who like a good alien story.

And what a great book it was! I'm a HUGE fan of Robert McCammon and have slowly been reading and re-reading all of his books. By doing so I've been treated to to the birth and growth of an incredible author, and a damn fine good time. Stinger has everything a horror fan could want, great characters, a great setting, humor, wit, and downright creepiness. Oh, and nasty monsters, warring gangs, and I could go on, but I think you get the picture. All this in a late 80s story that still rings true today.

Stinger is close to being great and I can't quite put in words what it's lacking.

I almost DNFed it, but I just decided to finish it so I could count it as a bingo read. I ended up not caring about any character we are introduced to, I wasn't scared, and I just went than goodness when I got to the end. The dying town of Inferno, Texas is on its last legs. In a few months when the local high school closed there won't be anything left of the town. When a spacecraft crashes, the remaining members of the town are left to fight off an alien calling itself Stinger. Stinger is after another alien that calls itself Daufin. Ultimately I think if the book had been edited a bit more, or we stuck with very few POVs that it could have worked better for me. I also didn't really like Daufin that much. Taking over the little girl named as Stevie and using her as a \"guardian\" isn't something that I thought a good alien would do. The writing didn't move me at all. And McCammon has been able to make me cry due to his writing. I just felt bored. The flow was pretty bad too. I think jumping between 10-15 characters is what did it. Some chapters were long, some were only a few pages. The ending unfortunately fell flat for me."}, {"userName": "Courtnie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8465040-courtnie", "userReview": "McCammon delivers for me a second time. Gruesome and riveting but with a lot of heart. My sample size is small yet as this is only my second McCammon, but I might prefer him to King.A small Texas town is rocked by the crash landing of an object of unknown origin. While something a little strange is going on with a local veterinarians young daughter who interacted with the busted up remnants first, the foreign object is not anything that the nearest air force base and personal can't contain and research...that is until a follow up arrival on a much larger scale brings a less than friendly visitor with a mission - one who traps a whole town for one terrifying night.At 550 pages, I really expected to be reading this for awhile. Fortunately, it moves at such a great pace that I didn't even notice the pages flying by until I reached the end.McCammon creates not only a story that sucks you in, but an atmosphere that is palpable. A hot, dying Texas town, isolated, and withering since the local mine shut down and took away all the jobs, not only feels uncomfortable and weathered, but also desperate...and thus the book opens. It's inhabitants are beaten, on edge and divided - when the unspeakable comes and threatens their very lives and the lives of everyone on the planet really, they are given one good reason to fight, for each other.And in case I am making this sound like puppies and bedtime stories, know that I'm glossing over the fact that this messed-up mucous monster from deep space likes to snatch people, eat them, and use it's advanced alien technology to recreate symbiotic extensions of itself in the skins of its victims to go out and destroy more people with a mouth of needle teeth and metal saw type hands.There is plenty of death and gory violence and characters of all walks and colors - everyone is a little rough around the edges, but the hope in humanity is what really makes this book shine. I loved it."}, {"userName": "Dreadlocksmile", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2075479-dreadlocksmile", "userReview": "First published back in 1988, Robert McCammon\u2019s sci-fi horror novel \u2018Stinger\u2019 followed on from the successful novels \u2018They thirst!\u2019 and \u2018Swan Song\u2019. Already with quite a well respected name for himself within the horror world, McCammon\u2019s \u2018Stinger\u2019 was a widely anticipated release for this author.Set in the not too distant future within a dusty Texas town named Inferno, the books starts off setting the scene in this scorching hot dying town. Work is hard to come by and life is hard for the residence of Inferno. Rival gangs rule the streets, fighting amongst themselves on almost a daily basis.The plot soon gets underway when two spacecrafts land close to the town. One of these is inhabited by an escaped alien named Daufin, who takes over the body of a little seven year old girl named Stevie Hammond. Daufin is hiding after being hunted down by the alien bounty hunter known as Stinger. The town\u2019s people are dragged into a war for their survival as the Stinger kills everyone in its path to reach Daufin.With a vast array of b-movie-esque characters fulfilling every possible clich\u00e9 going, \u2018Stinger\u2019 is a non-stop sci-fi horror thrill. McCammon uses a thick slab of exaggerated personalities for each one of the characters, in order to bring a life to each character. This further enables the reader to identify with certain selected characters as well as building up a love for each one.With a number of inner sub plots raging through the storyline, McCammon draws them all together to allow them to fight side by side against their common enemy. This delivers the usual b-movie message of overcoming each others rivalries in order to face the common evil.The pace of the storyline takes a few chapters to get going, but once it\u2019s underway the novel maintains a constant fast pace throughout. With the interwoven subplots surrounding the main storyline, McCammon manages to keep a highly entertaining novel going, with action packaged chapters leaving the reader with regular cliff hangers.The novel ends with a dramatic and well managed conclusion. The storyline is suitably built towards the eventual climax, wrapping up the story well and leaving the reader somewhat satisfied.The warfare between the two gangs \u2018The Renegades\u2019 led by a youth named Cody and the gang \u2018The Rattlesnakes\u2019 led by Cody\u2019s nemesis Rick Jurado, is throughally entertaining in a sort of post-apocalyptic gang warfare way (Class Of Nuke \u2018em High, Mad Max, Doomsday, etc).For a lowbrow entertaining sci-fi horror with an action packed storyline then you can\u2019t go far wrong with McCammon\u2019s \u2018Stinger\u2019. This is 576 pages of pure gritty horror with comic book characterisation and nail biting suspense."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/810550-bill", "userReview": "For the most part, Stinger was a fun read. I love a good mixture of horror and sci-fi, and this tale of an extraterrestrial on the run was an okay one.I liked the concept of Daufin, and her pursuer, and I liked the relationship between Rick and Cody. Apart from that, though, I don't much else to say about it.I think the story could easily have survived with 200 less pages. By the time I was 400 pages in, it seemed action was just a little too drawn on, and I was getting to the point of, okay, can we please just wrap this up already?One thing did bother me because I am a stickler for accuracy: It seemed every time these gang members were in a battle-lust, it was after they had smoked marijuana. I don't know how much, if any, experience McCammon has with this, but I can't ever remember seeing a stoner engage in violent activity.Now don't mistake me for defending the use of dope...while I admit it was a part of my youth, I think its true menace is causing lethargy, ambivalence, and loss of drive and ambition.Hardly violence.McCammon might have been better to choose alcohol has the gangs' battle fuel for credibility's sake."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17371689-kimberly", "userReview": "Re-read remains a solid 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Marvin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin", "userReview": "Robert McCammon is quite gifted at taking old ideas and infusing them with new life. He also tends to write like he is writing with the movies in mind. He wrote Stinger like he had a TV movie in mind. The idea of good alien being chased by bad alien while endangering the human race is somewhat of a standard idea. The author does manage to write some excellent action segments and the ending moves like a runaway train ablaze. Yet his characters are cardboard cutouts. McCammon uses every small town cliche in the book and throw in a little Romeo and Juliet too. For an action-adventure novel it ranks a solid three stars.

McCammon even tends to go out of his way at points to explain things to you. The characters are given some back story but I found them to be mostly two dimensional. The rivalry between Cody and Rick as the big bad gang leaders felt ridiculous and poorly written. I attribute this to the fact that it was written in the 80\u2032s and not that McCammon is a bad writer, the decade just called out for cheesy rivalries like this. Additionally the friction between Cody and is father (the drunken Curt Lockett who\u2019s all sad about his dead wife) feels transparent and clich\u00e9 right up to the inevitable redemption of the father that feels like it came right out of Independence Day (again, this predates that movie by a decade so I can forgive that).All that said, this is a book that will keep you reading and provide some entertainment.

Basic premise: Alien shows up on earth, takes over the body of little girl, another alien shows to bring back the other alien who we find out is an escaped \"prisoner\". The power within this book is 100% the characters. McCammon gives us such string characters that we have no choice but to get wrapped up in the story. His whole book could have been about the stuggle between the two gangs, or the relationship between Cody and Curt (son and drunk dad), or just about the Hammond family. Heck, even the rich older lady could have been a decent story. But what it all boils down to is he made a book crammed full of wonderful characters, a book where the only REAL bad guy is Stinger. Even the bad guys in the town are not really that bad, with the exception of one person, and he is removed from the game almost as quick as we meet him.

I did quite enjoy the first 200 pages (before the baddies arrived) and found some likeable characters and looked forward to the development of the plot line...however...once the invasion happened we have the big fight of good v evil (in the form of a scorpion like stinger alien!)and this struggle went on for some 300+ pages and frankly it bored the *** of me.

That certainly sounds more like science fiction than horror but the way Robert McCammon unfolds this plot is pure horror. Trust me. The nature of the bounty-hunter alien (nicknamed \u201cStinger\u201d) is a scorpion-like, mucus producing, monster with the ability to rapidly replicate allies using spare machine parts and captured human bodies. In effect it can build its own army in its effort to capture its quarry. Awesome!Most of the novel is devoted to developing the many characters of the small town of Inferno. It\u2019s a town that is on its last legs due to the local copper mine being played out so all of the citizens are being forced to close up shop, finish their last few days of the school year, and prepare to move elsewhere. There is a wide variety of characters in this town, from all walks of life. The town also suffers from a racial divide due to its proximity to Mexico and a perception that illegals are taking local jobs. But a common enemy can bring even the most viral enemies to work together and begin to understand one another a little better. My only quibble with this novel is that there may have been too many characters. That served to lengthen the novel a bit and slow down the build-up to the action sequences.A UFO/alien/horror story can be pretty standard fare but in the hands of this author, it truly shines. I first discovered Robert McCammon through his historical mystery novel, Speaks the Nightbird, a novel that was so impressive that it made my all-time favorite list. Subsequent novels in that series did not disappoint. But I also knew his roots lay in the horror genre so I sampled his masterpiece, Swan Song and was, once again blown away by the quality of his writing.

I wasn't a rabid, hardcore fan -- but a fan nonethless.Stinger changed that. I'm now a very dedicated fan of Robert McCammon. This book is about two opposing terrestrial forces that comes to a small, dying town in Texas. One -- Daufin -- is on the run and the other -- Stinger -- is a bounty hunter looking for the criminal alien force.I know what you're thinking -- that sounds like the plot of a cheaply-made B-movie, and not a very good one at that. Yeah, this book would lend itself pretty well to a sci-fi thriller or SyFy miniseries. It's quick, lots of fun, and not too deep. However, what sets this 1988 novel apart from your run-of-the-mill alien stories is the characters McCammon creates. They leap off the page and practically demand the reader fall in love with them. Among the wide cast of characters is an alcoholic, teen gang members, a rich old biddy, a veterinarian, a mentally ill military vet, a sheriff who feels he isn't making a difference in his small town, a high school teacher about to lose his job, and many others. Everyone here -- including Daufin and Stinger -- have a story and chances at redemption. As well as great characters, Stinger simply flies. I couldn't stop turning the pages and only put down the book when I absolutely had to. I could have finished the 450-page novel in two days if it weren't for, ya know, my job and other responsibilities. *sigh* I digress.... McCammon is now 4/4 with me, and Stinger is probably my second favorite book of his out of those I've read so far. If you're looking for a quick and fun summer read filled with a great cast of characters, lots of scares, and a good deal of heart, look no further. McCammon's sci-fi is totally accessible for those who aren't really into spaceships and weird life forms (like this guy) -- he makes it enjoyable and understandable and, frankly, believable.

Part of it may have been in my mood, and part due to what else I\u2019d been reading previously. I was in the mood for an alien invasion story, and Stinger is that. However, despite a prologue that seemed to set the stage for the horrors to come, nothing really happened that had anything to do with aliens until about 80 pages in. We were introduced to the characters at some length, and they were interesting and well drawn, but I wasn\u2019t in the mood for a character study. When the alien is introduced, it seems more friendly than threatening, and this proves to be accurate. The dangerous aliens don\u2019t appear until page 197. And even though they are pretty cool, by that time I\u2019d largely lost interest. Part of my issue may have been that I\u2019d just been on a Harlan Coben binge and his books rocket along with frequent twists and turns. I did finish \u201cStinger\u201d but was not very emotionally involved in it. I was curious about what would happen to certain characters, and I really enjoy McCammon\u2019s prose. If I were going to recommend some McCammon, I\u2019d recommend a book like \u201cThey Thirst,\u201d or his short story collection, \u201cBlue World.\u201d Both are outstanding works. And if you\u2019re in the mood for a kind of ET meets Alien book that builds slowly, \u201cStinger\u201d might be for you."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3600343-rob", "userReview": "2.5 stars.If you're writing genre fiction, it's a gamble to swing for the fences. In some ways it's easier (and maybe more satisfying to some readers) to forgo things like character development and thematic resonance in favor of plot momentum. Just strip it down and let it rip. If, on the other hand, you want to go for longevity, you've got to give the reader more than just cheap thrills, and that's where Robert R. McCammon's almost successful Stinger (1988) ultimately fails. Because if you're going to take the time to dig a little deeper into character and story, you'd better be good at it.The novel is almost begging for the first approach I described above. A benevolent alien, escaping from an intergalactic prison, crashes its craft near Inferno, a remote Texas town, and takes over the body of a six-year-old girl until it can find a way to escape. Meanwhile, one of the creatures maintaining the prison traces the escapee to Inferno, activates a skygrid around the town, and proceeds to hunt it down, wreaking havoc in its wake.When McCammon gets there \u2013 when Stinger, as its called, crash lands in the center of Inferno and begins its violent search \u2013 the book is a narrative steamroller. It's creepy and thrilling and does all the things you want a pulpy horror novel with literary aspirations to accomplish. The problem, however, is that it literally takes over 200 pages to get there. Here we are, on page 203 of 539:\"The fireball \u2013 almost two hundred feet across \u2013 roared down and crashed into Mack Cade's autoyard, throwing sheets of dust and pieces of cars into the air. Its shock wave heaved the earth, sent cracks scurrying along the streets of Inferno and Bordertown, blew out windows, and flung Cody Lockett off his feet . . .\"As fun as Stinger ultimately gets, what precedes that passage is 200 pages of deathly tedious world-building and attempts at developing characters we care about. We're treated to these various plot threads:\u2022 Tension between the white residents of Inferno and the Mexican-American residents of Bordertown, which usually manifests itself in gang violence between high school students (and some frankly atrocious racist language and attitudes, which I think is meant to be critical of the white townspeople, but because it's handled so clumsily just comes off as garden-variety racism).\u2022 The activities of the Hammond family \u2013 parents Tom (high school teacher) and Jessie (veterinary doctor) and their children Ray and Stevie \u2013 which include Ray's creepy obsessing over his female classmates and Tom's attempts at motivating two students, Cody and Rick, who are \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 key members in the two opposing gangs.\u2022 A World War II vet who takes care of an imaginary dog.\u2022 The arrival in town of Rick's hot sister Miranda, who exists for no reason other than to create more tension between the gangs because Cody, natch, thinks she's \"a smash fox\" (a dumb phrase McCammon overuses the first time it appears).\u2022 A whole lot of clich\u00e9d father-son tension between Cody and his neglectful alcoholic father Curt.\u2022 The arrival of two Air Force men \u2013 Barnes and Gunniston \u2013 on the search for the crashed spacecraft.It goes on and on in that vein for almost half the book, just a lot of generic prefab family drama that might as well have come out of a kit. I know why it's there: McCammon's trying to ultimately show how different groups of people who don't particularly get along can band together against a common enemy. But the payoff isn't satisfying because the setup is so hokey.And again, that's kind of a shame, because from the moment Stinger lands, the book gets a whole lot more interesting. As Stinger tracks down Daufin \u2013 the name the escapee gives itself after taking over Stevie's body \u2013 it does so by killing Inferno's residents and reanimating their bodies in variously creepy ways: human form but with needle teeth and claws; a man with half a dog growing out of his chest; a horse with a scorpion tail. In this way it removes any threats from the town while in its different human forms it tries to blend in in ways not totally dissimilar from John Carpenter's adaptation of The Thing. It ultimately becomes a race against time for the town's survivors to help Daufin escape before Stinger brings its entire army to Earth for colonization.I first read Stinger in high school (McCammon was one of the authors I discovered around the same time as Stephen King) but remembered very little about it. What I really need to do now is revisit some of his other books because I actually have very warm memories about them. I'm not sure if Stinger is a weak spot in his bibliography, or if I just hadn't developed the critical faculties to help me see how disastrously ordinary the first half is. If McCammon had cut out most of the ancillary world-building and structured the first half to focus on the discovery of Daufin's pod, the takeover of Stevie's body, and the arrival of Barnes and Gunniston, and then skipped straight to Stinger's arrival and the town's imprisonment, the book would have been a lean, balls-to-the-wall thriller. Right now, though, it's just needlessly flabby: a 530-page novel flailing about for importance when it could have been a hugely satisfying 300-page book that just wanted to scare the bejsus out of the reader."}, {"userName": "Lilyn G. | Sci-Fi & Scary", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33783014-lilyn-g-sci-fi-scary", "userReview": "Disclaimer: Received a copy from the narrator for review consideration.Swan Song was an amazing book, and I enjoyed every bit of the tale that Robert McCammon had to tell in it. So, when I was offered the chance to review another one of his books in audio format by the narrator, I eagerly said yes. And about 1 hour into listening to Stinger, I was wishing I hadn\u2019t. Luckily that changed up a bit by the end of the book.I don\u2019t think that Stinger sucks, or anything like that. At its base, it\u2019s an interesting story. But it did feel like everything was against me liking this book. The one potentially bad thing about listening to an audio book is that you have to \u2018read\u2019 slowly. In my case, it slows my reading speed down to less than half of what I normally read at, even when I push the speed of the playback up to 1.5x. So, if there\u2019s any element of the narration or story that doesn\u2019t work for me, it\u2019s going to make it very difficult for me to stay engaged.Nick Sullivan is, objectively, a good narrator. He differentiates the voices, speaks with passion when need be, but doesn\u2019t over-dramatize things, and gives the story the attention it deserves. Unfortunately, the southern accents required due to the story setting set my teeth on edge. That, combined with the sometimes unpleasant voices (perfectly fitting the story just not my ears), and the obsession with the \u2018gang war\u2019 in the beginning of the book meant that Stinger was not an audio book I was eager to keep listening to. Also, although I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not wording this exactly right, I don\u2019t feel as though his voice was necessarily the right one for the book.There were elements of the book that I did like, though. Robert McCammon has created a great bad guy in Stinger. Every time he (it?) appears in a scene, it\u2019s this weird mix of fascinating and disgusting. I never liked him, but his scenes were some of the most captivating in the book. Dolphin was neat as well. I liked watching \u2018her\u2019 understanding of humans evolve rapidly over the short period of time the book takes place in. Every time action was happening, I was interested in what was going on. Once the gangs thing in the beginning was dealt with, and the action I had been waiting for finally got going, I was able to enjoy the novel a little bit. The last fourth of the book, I actually really liked.However, the characters were cardboard, the clich\u00e9s were many, and the glacial pace at which things got moving meant that this 24-hour time period felt more like a six month siege to me. I think Stinger would have been a much more enjoyable read/listen if it was about 150 to 200 pages shorter.One thing I did think repeatedly while listening to Stinger was that I was positive I would love it if it was adapted for film. McCammon has a way of painting visuals that you just know would translate into outright horrific images on screen.I really went back and forth on what to rate this. It wasn\u2019t a truly enjoyable experience for me, but a lot of the issues that I had weren\u2019t necessarily things that I could \u2018dock\u2019 for. A lot of it felt like it was more my issues than anything wrong with the book. (Something I believe especially so since finishing Boy\u2019s Life and absolutely loving it.) I recommend McCammon on the whole. Just can\u2019t particularly recommend Stinger."}, {"userName": "Albert", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15403697-albert", "userReview": "Very entertaining, I liked pretty much everything about this book.

After rereading it, I have a deeper appreciation for it. If you like your aliens mean, unmerciful, and horrifying, then you need to meet Stinger. Written in 1988, the story takes place in one 24-hour period and centers on the Texas town of Inferno where one alien (the bad guy) is in hot pursuit of another alien (the good guy). The inhabitants of Inferno have the unfortunate luck of being caught in the middle. Needless to say, Inferno will never be the same again. What I love most about McCammon's writing is the way he writes characters. Sure, he can write descriptions--\"The screen door's hinges shrieked like a scalded cat\" (not only do my ears hurt after hearing this sentence, but there's alliteration too!), and he can pace the story just right, and he can leave a few surprises till the end. But what sets McCammon apart from mediocre writers is the way he writes characters. I always feel for the people I meet in his stories, and this story is no different. Empathy, sympathy, anger, frustration, love, hatred, I felt all these and more for the characters in Stinger. That's why I read Robert McCammon's stories. The characters.

Given that it is nearly thirty years old, I think it deserves credit for probably having been fresh and original then. Things that seem cliche now -- the tough Mexican kid who loves his grandmother -- were probably strikingly inclusive back in the 80s. Plus, Stinger predates Stephen King's Under the Dome by some twenty years, though it lacks that book's character development and emotional heft. I also found the book's third person omniscient voice maddening since it made it very difficult to follow which character's thoughts I was reading. Ditto the fact that there were absolutely not indication in the book when a scene had changed setting so I was often left floundering as I tried to figure out what the hell was going on. I'm rounding up to four, but three and a half is closer to my actual opinion."}, {"userName": "Paul Nash", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33269229-paul-nash", "userReview": "This was a nice sci-fi \\ horror adventure!
