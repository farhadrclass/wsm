Nijuuhibakusha means literally \"twice radiation-sick individual\", and refers to the few people who, through staggering bad luck, managed to be present both at Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and then at Nagasaki three days later. The article I read was an obituary for Tsutomu Yamaguchi, the last surviving nijuuhibakusha. I was not surprised to discover that Mr. Yamaguchi was strongly opposed to nuclear weapons, and had spent a substantial part of his life campaigning against them. But it's funny how everything has a flipside; after reading the article, I also thought of this book. Young Jim Ballard was one of many Westerners who were interned after the Japanese took Shanghai. He grew up in a POW camp; his descriptions of life there are horrifying, more than anything else, because of the matter-of-fact way in which he presents them. This is simply how it was: inadequate food, arbitrary punishments and killings. Nothing to get excited about, after the first few months.The war is going badly for the Japanese, and it's becoming clear that they will lose. There is even less to eat than before. One day, the inmates are told that they are going on a long march to a different location. They don't have the strength for this. Jim realizes, without much emotion, that he's going to die. But a miracle happens. Over the dark waters of the bay, he sees a flash. It's a long way off, but he suddenly knows that he's been saved. The atom-bomb will make Japan surrender now, not months in the future, and he'll get out.After this, Ballard always has warm, fuzzy feelings for nuclear weapons. In the sequel, he describes the Vulcan bombers he sees at the Cambridgeshire base near where he then lives. He imagines the megatons they're carrying, and gives them a little pat on the head. There are few authors who can make me quite as disoriented as Ballard."}, {"userName": "Megan Baxter", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter", "userReview": "Hmm, three or four stars? This was good, but I don't think I'll read it again. On the other hand, that particular feeling does not say that this was a mediocre book. But that personal gut reaction is what I tend to use for star ratings - four stars means I would like to or wouldn't mind reading it again. Five stars are books I feel the need to own.

He said last year that because Crash (1973 published) elicited strong, even if negative, reaction from me, then it meant J. G. Ballard (1930-2009) was a genius. That book was disgusting. I hated almost everything about the story. Up to now I cannot get over the characters that hurt themselves by crashing their cars and there is that part where the hole in the body is bleeding and to stop the blood from flowing, an erect penis has to be inserted. Holy cow. I had no second thought when I clicked a lone star rating. Here\u2019s to you, Ballard! Hmmpf. This is my second novel by J. G. Ballard (1930-2009) and I still clicked a lone star but four turned into yellow. Here\u2019s to you, Ballard!, but this time, \nWow!\n, it is with full of admiration to his talent (God bless my brother. He is right: J. G. Ballard is a genius) and to what he had to undergo during his 3-year stay as a child in Lunghua Concentration Camp in Shanghai during WWII. Yes, this novel about Ballard as an 11 year old boy, a son of a wealthy British businessman in Shanghai, who got separated from his parents and had to endure 3 years surviving all by himself in various camps.What makes this quite different from the war stories seen in a child\u2019s perspective is Ballard\u2019s prose. It is so detailed yet it is devoid of commentaries. Ballard only describes what the child Jim sees almost without emotions. There is just a single scene when Jim sheds a tear and it is mentioned only in a single short sentence. It feels like Ballard would like his reader to experience Jim\u2019s sad and dangerous flight in a child\u2019s perspective rather than an adult's with built-in biases and prejudices. Ballard was British but he neither depicted Japanese nor Chinese as evil and British nor American as good men. In fact, Jim feels safer with Japanese soldiers (ironic really from an Allied adult\u2019s perspective) than being with British or American. Japanese soldiers ignore his surrender and feed him food while he roams starving around Shanghai, he thinks that Japanese soldiers are braver than British because Shanghai was captured, he dreams of becoming a pilot and thinks that his young Japanese friend will teach him how to fly\u2026War in the eyes of a child. Think Anne Frank not in the hiding but in an open concentration camp. Jim did not die even if he stayed 3 years in Lunghua. His desire to see his parents again was just so strong that he held on to this dream and it made his body strong despite of the extreme hunger (surviving in boiled rice and sweet potatoes), disease (malaria, dysentery, infections, etc), loneliness and physical abuse. As always, the book is better than the movie. I remember that in the movie, there is that boring part inside the concentration camp. The reason is that it is impossible for Spielberg to capture those small details in that part without probably extending the movie to maybe five hours. However, the ending in the movie, in my opinion, is better than the book. I don\u2019t want to put a spoiler so I will not tell you why."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "This outstanding novel seems to be so out of line with Ballard\u2019s other notoriously magical/maniacal work\u2014and this detail is fantastic. He is soon to become one of my all-time favorites\u2014his prose is as crisp and perfect as Graham Greene\u2019s. For a prophetic writer to go back to his roots, all the way back to Shanghai being wholly obliterated in the second World War\u2014this guile is the type required to write your magnum opus. &, although I haven\u2019t read all his work (though MOST I have), I can safely say that this one is it. \u201cEmpire of the Sun\u201d looks at the terrors of war through the eyes of a very authentic, very endearing boy. His observations are spot on\u2014he quickly becomes useful to many out on the war fields; he notices that, sometimes, being under the dragon\u2019s wing is precisely the tactic needed to survive; he thinks in tragic terms, digesting the horror for us amply, becoming a truly unforgettable character through it all. Like \u201cSuite Francoise\u201d\u2019s Irene Nemirovsky, Ballard\u2019s own personal involvement in WWII embellishes & fulfills the authentic aspect of the book. If they had not survived the war (although, tragically, Nemirovsky did not), we would not have their fine FINE work.And this would not be a J. G Ballard with no looming prophecy. The last page (SPOILER!!) contains the following Nostradamus-like statement: \u201cOne day China would punish the rest of the world and take a frightening revenge.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Brendon Schrodinger", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-brendon-schrodinger", "userReview": "'Empire of the Sun' is by far the best war book I have read. Not that I am a big reader of war books at all. I tend to avoid the fiction books as I have found over the years that no matter the imagination of the author, war was entirely more gruesome, graphic and even funnier than anything that could eventuate from one human mind. I find most war fiction embarrassing and trite.However, while 'Empire of the Sun' could be classed as a memoir, the author freely admits that his experiences are not exactly the same as young Jim, the protagonist of this tale. I guess most memoirs stretch the truth and make adjustments from reality to suit the format, J.G. has just admitted that he went a little further. Here Jim loses contact with his parents early in the novel during a siege on the city and we know that J.G. was interned with his parents in real life. Maybe there is more fiction than non-fiction here and I may need to eat my words.There is so much to love in here, but I think this book may not be for everyone. Firstly, this book is pretty graphic in it's description of Jim's surroundings. There are realistic descriptions of corpses, death and disease throughout. But it's never gratuitous and it's always frank. It's not a novel with an uplifting tale of adversity. Yes, you could make a great guess that Jim survives the ordeal, but does he or anyone overcome adversity? Not at all. This is definitely not a rallying book. You do not cheer on the good guys. And despite what Hollywood would make you think, you do not cheer on the end of the war.And I think that is one of the big messages of the book. War does not start on a declaration and it does not end with a surrender.You do not flip the war coin to find peace written in shiny silver letters. It seems to be that the happiest years of young Jim's life were when he was eating one sweet potato a day, slowly wasting away, getting every disease that came his way all the while running around an internement camp idolising the Japanese pilots and ingratiating himself to the Japanese officer in charge of the camp. Throughout the book Jim wants the Japanese to win the war and does not see how they can lose it because they have the bravest soldiers in his opinion. J.G. really does capture the naive innocence yet canny and literal understanding that children have. Adult speech is littered with sarcasm, exaggeration and metaphors that children take literally. Only their observations of the world around them hold true. Jim knows when someone is about to die in the camp hospital as they were given the one and only mosquito net. And yet he could not understand when the war had ended nor could he understand why the next war hadn't started when everyone in the camp was saying \"The next World War will start soon\" in reference to the communist rising.The fact that Jim adapts to his life much more than any adult is unsurprising. So, for me, this is a damn magnificent read. I valued the look at war from a child's perspective. I also learnt that the end of war can be worse than war itself and the story is far from over when the diplomats shake hands and documents are signed.I listened to this on Audible. It was narrated by Steven Pacey (same last name as one of the main characters) and he did a brilliant job."}, {"userName": "Jan-Maat", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat", "userReview": "I read Ballard's semi-autobiographical account of his interment as a child and teenager in a Japanese camp outside of Shanghai while I was still at school and before I had read any of his fiction.As I later read a few of his novels I had a slow and growing sense of how his adult fiction drew upon that early experience described in this memoir in both the world-turned-upside-down story which resurfaces in several of Ballard's later novels and the oddly half affectionate tone of the child narrator for the Japanese even in the internment camp - there is an incident when he is being taught trigonometry and he asks the Doctor who is teaching him if he should show the Japanese guards his sums so that they could improve their targeting of incoming American bomber planes, more striking is the strange atmosphere as the young Ballard watches Kamikaze pilots walking about the airfield that borders the internment camp before they depart on their missions.Novels like The Drowned World and The Drought reinterpret the childhood experience in a way to make it explicable to adult readers who didn't grow up in Shanghai before the Second World War and didn't live through the collapse of seemingly concrete family and power structures, the complete transformation of one way of life for another, the metaphor that Ballard has used is that this is like a set change, and therefore the way that familiar, everyday life is just a piece of theatre. If it appears permanent and unchanging this is only because the curtain hasn't fallen yet. Perhaps something of this idea underlies the popularity of a certain kind of disaster literature and drama whether of vampires, zombies or alien invaders - that there is a more true fundamental set of values beneath the surface of everyday modern life in which problems can be resolved directly and in a natural manful way by shooting at them. It can follow that there is even an eagerness for a disaster, any disaster provided it is destructive enough, to clear away contemporary civilisation. I think Ballard's view is slightly different. His point, I suspect, is that the world of the camp is as (in)substantial as the international community of 1930s Shanghai or of post war south-west London. When the Yangtze river flooded, the young Ballard could see that the land around Shanghai had became an inland sea, once the flood waters had ebbed Shanghai was surrounded once more by arable land. Both conditions were equally real, both subject to the functioning of the environment. Nudge that environment, and you see that glistening cityscape as a house of cards."}, {"userName": "Whitaker", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1415047-whitaker", "userReview": "The interesting thing about The Empire of the Sun is the time period Ballard writes about. I don't mean the period of the protagonist's incarceration. In fact, the book pretty much skips most of the four years that Jim spends in the POW camp. We are with Jim at the start of the war when he is 10 years old and he fights his way to get into the POW camp, and we are with him again at the end of the war when he is 14 years old and he fights his way from the chaos of a countryside filled with ragged bands of starving survivors to get back into the empty POW camp which offers at least some measure of safety. Unlike When the Emperor Was Divine, this book is not about the protagonist's experience as an internee in a camp. Instead, it is about what you would be willing to do to stay alive. And this is why, I think, Ballard leaves out the bulk of the period when Jim is in the POW camp: that is the period when there is relative order and prosperity. The prisoners are fed regularly and are kept in reasonably good health. It is only in the period before the imposition of order and authority and after it's disappearance that staying alive is less a statement than a question. So, here's a series of questions to ask yourself about what you might or might not be willing to do if you found yourself in a war-torn zone with no food: \u25cf Would you try to surrender to the enemy because at least you'd have the possibility of getting fed?\u25cf Would you deliberately lead your dubious allies-of-circumstance into a trap so that their capture would also allow you to get captured too?\u25cf Would you steal food from the common pot even though it would mean less for the others so that you can ensure that you will get enough to eat? \u25cf Would you collaborate with the enemy so as to get more food for yourself or your children?This is the perennial state of affairs for Jim:Now that he felt stronger, Jim realized how important it was to be obsessed by food. Shared equally among the prisoners, their daily rations were not enough to keep them alive. Many of the prisoners had died, and anyone who sacrificed himself for the others soon died too. The only way to leave the detention centre was to stay alive.The thing is, I've seen this type of behaviour before. Similar survival instincts kick in during retrenchments when the pool of resources (money or jobs) runs low. Then it's whatever dirty trick will work so that it's not your head next on the chopping block. Morality counts for very little. And that visceral drive to live is what Ballard is interested in, what he\u2014ultimately\u2014respects. It informs, as well, I think, his support of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki: over and above his own personal survival (he recounts how the Japanese planned to march the POWs north to shoot them but the surrender intervened) it meant that more Allies lived. By that measure, morality be damned. We don't often think of this, but for many in Africa, China, India, Latin America, and latterly in Europe, that's their daily life. \"Morality\" (and I do mean those inverted commas) is a luxury I am glad to be able to currently afford, but that doesn't mean that I am never unaware that it is very much a luxury."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/520753-kim", "userReview": "I remember one Saturday afternoon during the winter of 1987/1988 when my friend Chuck and I decided that instead of hitting the mall we would take in a movie. Our choices weren\u2019t great\u2026 Rent-a-Cop, Return of the Living Dead Part II , Braddock, Missing in Action Part III.  Yeah, so, we opted for Empire of the Sun. I had no real inkling to see it. I really didn\u2019t care. I remember that the movie had these big gaps of silence. Shots of Christian Bale running around an internment camp, flying a toy bomber, hunting for food. I think that\u2019s mostly what I remember of it. That and Chuck\u2019s reaction. You see, Chuck was the stereotypical \u2018skateboarding stoner\u2019, and I\u2019m not joking or being flippant. He relished that label. He\u2019d put Jeff Spicoli to shame, really\u2026 Yet, he was completely engrossed in this film. I mean, elbows on knees, leaning forward, shushing ME, kinda engrossed. It was\u2026 off-putting to say the least. I found out later, that he went back to see the film another half dozen times. This is a boy that worked at Wendy\u2019s and spent all his money on pot. Go figure.So, now, 20 some odd years later, I\u2019m reading this book and trying to use my adultified brain to figure out what exactly mesmerized Chuck so. The story is poignant, made more so when you read that it\u2019s based on JG Ballard\u2019s childhood experiences during WWII. From the get go, I was amazed at the detachment exhibited by Jim regarding death. It was constantly surrounding him and he could shrug it off and continue his make believe games of flying bombers and wounding the enemy. Of course, it\u2019s hard to say who is the enemy while living in Shanghai in 1942. The book has much more power in that we get to hear Jim\u2019s thoughts and observations, it fills those silences with awe striking clarity and numbing accounts of soldiers stacked along the roadside and how the skin of a sweet potato can taste like the best chocolate imaginable. It lends resonance when he\u2019s confused about his sexual feelings towards a fellow prisoner and roommate, Mrs. Vincent, and the absolute dissolution when he watches fellow prisoners perish from disease and hunger. It\u2019s achingly effective. There is a scene, towards the end, the war is over, he\u2019s trying to get back to Shanghai to find his parents but he happens across a Japanese pilot that had offered him a mango days before. Jim has always felt a kinship to this pilot, a boy not much older than himself and has fantasies of a camaraderie that, of course, never comes to fruition. The pilot\u2019s mouth opened in a noiseless grimace. His eyes were fixed in an unfocused way on the hot sky, but a lid quivered as a fly drank from his pupil. One of the bayonet wounds in his back had penetrated the front of his abdomen, and fresh blood leaked from the crotch of his overall. His narrow shoulders stirred against the crushed grass, trying to animate his useless arms. Jim gazed at the young pilot, doing his best to grasp the miracle that had taken place. by touching the Japanese he had brought him live; by prizing his teeth apart he had made a small space in his death and allowed his soul to return. Jim spread his feet on the damp slope and wiped his hands on his ragged trousers. The flies swarmed around him, stinging his lops, but Jim ignored them. He remembered how he had questioned Mrs. Philips and Mrs. Gilmour about the raising of Lazarus, and how they had insisted that far from being a marvel this was the most ordinary of events. Every day Dr. Ransome had brought people back from the dead by massaging their hearts. Jim looked at his hands, refusing to be overawed by them. He raised his palms to the light, letting the sun warm his skin. For the first time since the start of the war, he felt a surge of hope, If he could raise this dead Japanese pilot he could raise himself and the million of Chinese who had died during the war and were still dying in the fighting for Shanghai, for a booty as illusory as the treasury of the Olympic stadium. I have to admit that before this, I was clinging to the book, reading it like I was reading a diary of events. Because who am I, a woman who has no inkling what war is like except what I see on CNN, to be able to extract the emotion of this boy from a different time? Then I imagine this 15 year old boy playing Christ, trying to raise the souls of all the people, family, that he had watched perish\u2026 wow. I still wonder what attracted Chuck to this. Was it the \u2018little boy lost\u2019 theme? The growing up and discovering who you are amongst a war that was real or imagined? The detachment? I wish I knew where he was so I could ask him\u2026 it might shed light on what was behind the \u2018skateboarding stoner\u2019 that I thought I knew so well."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex", "userReview": "Part of my Fall 2017 Best Of Chinese Literature project; more here, and a cool list of books here.\"The reality that you took for granted was just a stage set,\" is what JG Ballard has to tell you. He learned it as a child, when World War II came to his home in China. \"Anyone who has experienced a war first hand knows that it completely overturns every conventional idea of what makes up day-to-day reality.\" This semi-autobiographical book is about that overturning. Young Jim adapts immediately, and that's the thing about people according to Ballard, who's always written about \"whether we are much different people from the civilized beings we imagine ourselves to be.\" (Well, that and carfucking.) Ballard is unsentimental about Jim, who unsettles everyone around him just by how quickly he acquiesces to the new reality. He's gross, in his shameless hustling and scheming and stealing, and in his actual, emaciated, infected body. It's not just that he refuses to die; it's that he seems comfortable as an animal. As we age we start to think that we really are civilized, and adults in these internment camps in WWII needed to think it would all be over someday, that they'd be able to return to civilization. Jim shrugs civilization off so easily that everyone else gets vertigo.Here's a startling detail about this book: the major thing Ballard changed from his own life was that he wrote his parents out of it. In Empire of the Sun Jim is immediately separated from them, but the young Ballard never was. The reason is that their presence screwed up the truth of the book; Ballard couldn't find a way to convey how unable they were to protect him in the internment camp. I don't know if that blows your mind as much as it blows mine: a reality so savage that parents are irrelevant.So Ballard is the Toto to civilization's Oz: he saw behind the curtain early, and he's talented enough to write down what the wizard looks like back there. It's gross.Quotes are all from an interview at the back of my edition.

Moving, beautiful written with many tense, nervy moments and a heartbreaking finale.

The sights and descriptions before the war are often strange and fantastic, but once war breaks out Ballard is free to unleash the kind of images and incidents which made his name. This is never less than pure Ballard. Okay, there isn\u2019t as much sex as in other books, but his obsessions with new worlds, the looming apocalypse aviation and excreta are all present and correct.Of course Ballard\u2019s inspiration for this book came from his childhood, and having a young boy narrator not only adds an extra level of fear as this is someone who doesn\u2019t fully understand the world anyway, but also makes it a far more human work than some of his other novels.A superb read, and it contains the best expansion of Chandler\u2019s assertion \u201cthere is nothing emptier than an empty swimming pool\u201d I have ever come across."}, {"userName": "Jeff Jackson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/811567-jeff-jackson", "userReview": "A biographical novel that deals with Ballard's time in Japanese internment camps during WWII, told with an unusual slant: The narrator almost seems to thrive and looks up to his captors as the only ones who can protect him.

G. Ballard's novels often perplexes me. He has a stunningly powerful style of writing yet it often feels emotionally detached. Empire of The Sun is not only his best novel but goes a long way to explain the author's somewhat schizoid style of writing. The autobiographical novel is based on his internment as a child in a Japanese prisoner of war camp in China during World War II. Even though it is called a novel, I would not be surprised to find that very little is actually fictional. For Ballard, the time was both harrowing and \"fun\", a word he used in interviews to describe his actual internment. Ballard is not ignorant of the irony involved here. He was simply a child making the best of a bad situation. He describes the terrors, the joys and the monotony of his childhood in a dispassionate way as if he is trying to decipher the meaning for himself. Those who have seen the Spielberg film may be surprised how unheroic the child protagonist is in the book. The normalcy of an abnormal existence is a theme is Ballard's' work and where that comes from becomes clear in the novel. Ballard is one of the greatest writers of the second half of the 20th century and this is one of the greatest novels of the same period. If you have not read anything by J. G. Ballard, this is his most accessible work and the best place to start."}, {"userName": "Meirav Rath", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123169-meirav-rath", "userReview": "Oh, Steven Spielberg, how dare you kill this wonderful book's plot with a blunt instrument, burn it, trample it and then leave it to be raped by a horde of Cossacks, how?!

The beginning shows Jim, already pretty hardened by his wartime environment, engaging with various images. This part is slow but the oddly totemic way Jim relates to the material world is idiosyncratic. Jim is a little boy fascinated by aircraft, and this fascination continuing throughout becomes a little stranger because it becomes more nakedly what it really is: being a bit of a fan of war. This kind of thing wore on me at times but it's part of the dispassionate but off-balance flavour of the book. The city of Shanghai sounds like a SF city, impossibly dazzling and changing. Ballard apparently wrote SF cities drawing on his memories of Shanghai before deciding to write the real thing, so that's oddly circular.  Once Jim has become separated from his parents I found it pretty gripping; it's an account of human experience it's hard not to find interesting. It's the skull beneath the skin, basically. This separation from his parents is the biggest difference between the book and Ballard's own experience; he said if the parents were there it would be hard for readers to understand how much it didn't matter that they were there. Few of the adults around him have any time for treating a child who isn't theirs like a child, so he floats into a peculiar status, without an adult mind-set or the role of a child. For a lot of the time in the camp, the time we don't really hear about, Jim is having a pretty great time, able to get into everything that is happening. Then the food starts running out and we are back to the survival surrounded by death that is Jim getting to the camp in the first place. There's no talking about death in the way it happens in a situation like this without the idea that human life has paramount value receding. It recontextualises our emotions in an uncomfortable way. Jim finds it impossible to process the idea that the war is over, when it's over, and the book makes it clear that \"over\" is not a simple thing."}, {"userName": "Herrikias", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/323148-herrikias", "userReview": "The book resonated beyond being the key to unlocking the symbolism found in the rest of Ballard's works. In its own brutal way, it is the dawning of a sheltered european to the reality of the world. Thinking turned for idle fancy to centering on trade. How everyone needs something just like you, and how to obtain it with objects, skills, or favors. How everyone takes everyone else for granted. Not just the Americans using Jim, but in turn how Jim has no qualms exploiting those who take pity on him. He seemed to be on the short end of the stick, but as he acknowledges giving support is equivalent to receiving it as far as he was concerned.Most haunting for me was his interpretation of souls. His obsession with seeing souls escape, his delusion he could return souls to the living if he performed cargo cult-like imitations of the doctor, and his general musings concerning the nature free of the restraining trappings of christianity made it seem far more appealing in its perversity. It's casual nature in a world filled with death and waiting death.What wonders is, what did he hold back from his experiences to tone down the novel?"}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2450538-louise", "userReview": "would classify Empire of the Sun as an adventure novel about a boy\u2019s life during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai in WWII.The book is graphic and spares no details about how people die, but it wasn\u2019t graphic to the point where I had to put it down. Halfway through reading this, I realized that it was not fiction and was actually an autobiography, which made it a bit more difficult to read the particularly gruesome parts.Empire of the Sun not only has an accurate portrayal of how a teenage boy would act during internment, but also the thoughts that would run through his head. There are parts in the book which had me on the edge of my seat because I was sure the boy was about to die, but knew that it couldn\u2019t happen logically since it\u2019s a biography.Ballard not only provides an exciting adventure story, but also great insight into the human condition.

No infinitely-spiralling meanings within meanings, no apocalypse of the psyche, but--- a real life Inferno, the world spinning backwards as witnessed by the author in his childhood in Thirties Shanghai during the Japanese invasion. \"\u201cWars came early to Shanghai, overtaking each other like the tides that raced up the Yangtze and returned to this gaudy city all the coffins cast adrift from the funeral piers of the Chinese Bund. Jim had begun to dream of wars. At night the same silent films seemed to flicker against the wall of his bedroom in Amherst Avenue, and transformed his sleeping mind into a deserted newsreel theater.\"As told by the author's adolescent eyewitness Jim, there is sharp focus thoughout this story, but it is blunted by the innocence of the teller, who is swept away by the events long before understanding them... A child of British colonial civil servants and cast adrift in the confusing events of 1937 at the foreign delegations of Shanghai, Jim is wide open to the experience and tells the tale with a simple, ingenuous honesty, not overly bound by allegiances to any country.An intense interlude with every aspect of society in an uproar leaves Jim abandoned in the upscale haunts of the International Settlement, revisiting the large houses of diplomats and professionals, now deserted, for tins of food or anything edible. Venturing out of this depopulated realm does him not much better : \"\u201cOutside the tram station in the Avenue Haig, the hundreds of passengers were briefly silent as they watched a public beheading. The bodies of a man and woman in quilted peasant clothes, perhaps pickpockets, or Kuomintang spies, lay by the boarding platform. The Chinese NCOs wiped their boots as the blood ran into the metal grooves of the steel rails. A tram crowded with passengers approached, its bell forcing the execution party aside.... Jim watched the coolies and peasant women staring at the headless bodies. Already the press of tram passengers was pushing them aside, submerging this small death. Jim turned away, tripping over a charcoal brazier in which a pavement vendor was frying pieces of battered snake... \" Once the International sector becomes fully manned and controlled by the Japanese, Jim is forced into the outside world with not much to guide him but rumor and remembered truisms from his parents & their friends. Many of whom are to show up incongruously, in now very diminished conditions and situations-- throughout the book, now actual ghosts of their formerly empowered selves, characters on the wrong set. This is to become the heart of the book, a kind of disaster-picaresque odyssey through the nightmare of clashing civilizations, destroyed infrastructure, the overarching need-to-go-on conflicting with the knowing-better-in-the-first-place. The complexity of the conflict in the Japanese invasions of the China coast is that numerous European entities were well-entrenched, fully engaged in their intricate colonial pursuits, so when the clash happens it is a multicultural explosion. Running China by proxy one day are the Brits, (allied with the Us) utilizing their World-Power status to install colonial-guard regiments like the Ghurkas to keep the uneasy peace of Empire in Shanghai. And the next day the Japanese are putting the Chinese in chaingangs, deferring to the axis diplomatic corps of Germany and Italy, and trucking the Brits off en-masse to internment camps. The poignant balance of the narration evolves from naive / imaginative to embittered / experienced, as Jim evolves from boy to young man, and if that is a difficult journey normally, it's a mythic one in this bonfire of civilizations. At some point Jim awakens in the Olympic Stadium at Nantao, built as an enticement for the Olympics that never materialized by Madame Chiang Kaishek. The field is an outdoor hospital with detainees crowded by the hundreds on the playing green, the stands being stacked with the fineries and riches removed from the now-fully-ransacked International Settlement. \"\u201cAn hour later, when the rain had stopped, the flashes of an American air raid lit up the stadium, like the sheet lightning of the monsoon season. As a child, safe in his bedroom at Amherst Avenue, Jim had watched the sudden glares that exposed the rats caught in the center of the tennis court and on the verges of the swimming pool. Jim knew that he was awake and asleep at the same time, dreaming of the war, and yet dreamed of by the war.\"Second time I've read this, recommended."}, {"userName": "Dennis", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1512303-dennis", "userReview": "War transforms everything it touches and no person who has lived through it can be unchanged from having survived. So it was surprising to read the detailed account of an upper-class English boy who undergoes very little discernible character development despite outlasting nearly four horrendous years as a World War II prisoner.Young Jamie Ballard is the only child of wealthy British expatriates living in 1941 Shanghai whose exclusive country club world is the French Concession neighborhood \u2013 comfortable estates with swimming pools and air conditioning, lavish parties, gymkhanas and private schools. Jamie is accustomed to a household filled with servants, \u201ccoolies,\u201d including Yang who chauffeurs Jamie around town in a luxury Packard.With the beginnings of war brewing all around Asia, privileged Jamie spends his free moments daydreaming about technology, especially aviation, and imagining life as a pilot for the Japanese whom he admires most. When Japan finally bombs Pearl Harbor and all hell breaks loose, the HMS Petrel soon after succumbs to the Japanese cruiser Idzumo at Shanghai Harbor. In the ensuing pandemonium, Jamie becomes separated from his parents, but oddly seems not to care very much. For days he wanders the empty streets and amuses himself with his bicycle, exploring the eerily vacant territory while enjoying his newfound freedom. After several days, however, hunger begins to settle in along with the realization that his parents may not be returning, so Jamie determines to \u201csurrender\u201d to his heroes the Japanese. He is turned away.Jamie meets up with a couple of opportunist American sailors and learns skills that become crucial for his own survival such as to ingratiate himself with those who can provide food and useful services. Jamie eventually finds himself in Lunghua prison camp where he remains for over three years until the war ends.In Lunghua, death is commonplace\u2014even expected\u2014and day-to-day life\u2019s monotony is broken up only by the imagination of those determined to persist despite so many unknowns about whether or not they will live to see another day, let alone to the end of the war. Jamie witnesses abundant cruelty, starvation, and life-threatening unsanitary conditions. This is a world of every man for himself.What is perplexing is how little transformation Jamie undergoes during these critical adolescent years spent under unthinkable circumstances. Perhaps Jamie\u2019s emotional and psychological growth are stunted precisely because he is forced to muster the strength and sheer will just to survive, and because he manages to accomplish that without any guidance or nurturing whatsoever by anyone around him. It is telling that Jamie persists with his boyish attitudes of self-absorption and insular self-focus. It seems to bother him very little that he is the least of anybody\u2019s concern.In light of the fact that this account is semi-autobiographical, and described as \"coming of age,\" I expected to see more perspective from the author, anything about what he learned from these traumatic experiences. Instead, both Jamie the child and Jim Ballard the author remain static psychologically and emotionally. Jim rather relishes his aloofness and indifference to life, life\u2019s purpose, and human relationships. Even when adults die who had befriended him during their years together in the camp, Jim seems to care little more than to make a mental note of the fact.Empire of the Sun is a glum tale of endurance, an intricate narrative describing the ordeals that one experiences while outlasting monumental battles for one\u2019s own life set against the larger context of surviving world war. The residual feeling for me is satisfaction that Ballard lived to share his tale, of course, but also an unambiguous sadness contemplating whether in fact he fully survived."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "This was a very interesting book. Probably like most people, when I think of WWII, I think of a few historical \"touchpoints\": Nazi Germany, Pearl Harbor, Iwo Jima, Hiroshima. The biggies. This book isn't about any of them. Well, not directly. This book is personal and intimate and shows the gritty underbelly of a war that people like to romanticize. Heck, even the main character romanticized the war, and he was living it! Quickie synopsis: Jim is happy and sheltered living in Shanghai with his parents. War starts. Jim is separated from parents and then begins a crazy messed up survivor-journey through Japanese invaded and war-torn China to try to find them. Now I like gritty and realistic coming of age type stories. This one was an interesting look at what happens when you have to come of age not only while a war is taking place, but smack-dab in the middle of it, suffering and starving and unsure of tomorrow, even while seeing the world through a child's eyes. The fascination with both cars and planes got a bit tiresome, but what the heck else did he have to entertain himself with?Two things did get rather on my nerves: First, the dialogue felt very fake and unnatural. Yes, I do realize that this is a well-mannered and enthusiastic 11 year old doing his best to survive, and if that means ingratiating himself to anyone and everyone he meets, then so be it. But, is it REALLY necessary to repeat everything that is said to him? Is he a boy or a parrot?Example- Basie says: \"I took good care of you, Jim.\"Jim says: \"You took good care of me, Basie.\"Second, twice during the course of the book, Ballard used the phrase \"Two years ago, when Jim was younger...\". This just annoys me for some reason. Two years ago, obviously Jim was younger. Why say it? We're not dumb. Actually, I'm being picky. No we're not dumb readers, but I don't really think that Ballard meant it that way. I think he was trying to say that Jim has matured in a very short time, but just chose a really bad way of saying it. Anyway, those are nit-picky things, but they were distracting to me.
