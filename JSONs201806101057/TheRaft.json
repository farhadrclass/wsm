Wow. I need to stop bitching when I get a little sunburn or miss lunch.This memoir was put together by Robert Trumbull in 1942 soon after Harold Dixon, Gene Aldrich, and Tony Pastula underwent their trying ordeal. It's told from Dixon's perspective. He was the pilot and senior to the other two. He gives his opinions relatively freely. His descriptions of their journey are novel-worthy, making for one heck of a nail-biting read.Some of the details, like what they were doing and where it took place, had to be left sketchy because the war was still ongoing. But that doesn't detract from the essence of their story. I've read a few sea survival biographies and this ranks right up there with its storms, sharks, deprivation, hope and despair. Heck, this even includes an encounter with natives, like it was some kind of fanciful 18th century adventure tall tale. At times I felt like I was reading of Captain Bligh's post-mutiny survival voyage or a better version of Robinson Crusoe.If reading The Raft doesn't sound like your thing, perhaps you might watch it? It was recently made into a movie, Against the Sun, starring Malfoy..."}, {"userName": "Eric_W", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w", "userReview": "The perfect book to read while solidifying in subzero weather is The Raft by Robert Trumbull. And one look at the cover will suggest that another bite of that fat laden steak is well-worthwhile. Trumbull retells the story of 3 aviators whose plane went down in the Pacific. They had a rubber raft and little else because the plane sank so quickly. They were adrift for 34 days and traveled over 1,000 miles. The raft was about four by eight feet. It was so small that no one could stretch out. \"Imagine doubling up on a tiny mattress, with the strongest man you know striking the underside as hard as he could with a baseball bat, twice every three seconds, while someone else hurls buckets of cold salt water in your face.\" The raft also had a nasty tendency to overturn when waves got a little high, or the occupants moved incorrectly. Their clothes were often wet from spray. They were very hot during the day and cold at night. They had no food, and, after the several flips of the raft, only a penknife and themselves for company. It's always amazing how resourceful people can be under trying circumstances. Harold Dixon, who had the most navigational experience, managed to calculate about where they were and where they needed to go, more or less, and then figured small ways to steer the craft to go in that particular direction. Squalls were viewed as a mixed blessing. Rain was their only source of drinking water (which they gathered by wringing out their clothes. But squalls brought wind and waves which might turn them over.Finally, after being tossed by the winds of a passing hurricane they sighted an island toward which they frantically paddled, The natives were astonished to see them for they managed to float through the surf of a coral reef that the natives considered impenetrable in their canoes. They were slowly nursed back to health and then eventually rescued."}, {"userName": "Midge", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/356569-midge", "userReview": "I found this book as I was cleaning out a bookcase in my parents' home. Mom belonged to the Book-of-the-Month Club during the WW II years, and this 1942 copy still has the review and synopsis by the Club News inside. It is the true story of three US navy-men who took off from a carrier on a bombing mission, ran out of gas, and had to ditch in the ocean somewhere in the South Seas. They, unfortunately, end up in a small rubber raft with no food or water and little else, floundering and supporting each other for 34 long and painful days.

This book was written by the person that experienced the raft, not by a professional author so the style is pretty straightforward, nothing fancy. They suffered immensely.

I rarely browse this one used book store close by with the hopes of a worthwhile find. This place is a hodgepodge of battered paper backs strewn on overstuffed shelves and collapsing piles, but I have by luck found several unforgettable reads in the past. This one kind of stood out, it was old and yellowed with that musty dry smell of old newspapers, but in pristine condition. In fact I doubt it had ever been read. The price on the cover was 60 cents, early 1960's, but the cover art and the title drew me right to it..... I love these type stories, man against nature and hardship. I am always humbled by the sheer power of man's will to survive and ability to endure and overcome the most unforgiving situations and occurrences. Just when you think it can't get any worse it does, and even then it gets much darker. I add this little story to my list of some of the best true life sea survival stories I have read. Just imagine yourself and two others adrift in a 4x8 (outside dimension) rubber raft in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with no food, no water, one small pocket knife, and very little else. Would you be scared, would you be pessimistic, would you be amiable to your fellows, would you crack as the thirst dried you up from the inside and your body steadily devoured itself? The sun baking you black as your clothes rotted off your body exposing every inch of you to the blazing equatorial heat. Such is the power held in this true tale of survival. A very good read, indeed!"}, {"userName": "Amerynth", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2993355-amerynth", "userReview": "Reporter Robert Trumbull's book \"The Raft\" tells the story of Harold Dixon, Tony Pastula and George Aldrich. The trio's plane crashed in the ocean during World War II and they floated in a rubber raft for 35 days with a knife, rusting pistol and a couple of life jackets along side them. Their survival is nothing short of a miracle.Told with sparse, short sentences, the book is not a literary masterpiece. However, the story is very readable and engrossing. There are loads of better written survival stories out there, but not as many that are quite as miraculous.It is unfortunate that Trumbull's account relies only on an interview with Dixon for information. The book would be much more fascinating if it included interviews with Aldrich and Pastula as well. It's interesting that only Dixon was awarded the Navy Cross, while Aldrich and Pastula were simply commended by the Navy... it seems all three were in the same ordeal, not sure why one was treated differently than the others after the fact."}, {"userName": "Chantel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9950038-chantel", "userReview": "I didn't realize this was a re-release of a nonfiction book from the early 1940s when I picked it up at the library. If i had known, I might have missed out on learning about this 70 years ago headline catching news story. What an amazing story of survival!Wiki: Three downed U.S. Navy fliers from the USS Enterprise landed on Pukapuka in February 1942.[5] Harold Dixon, Gene Aldrich, and Tony Pastula survived 34 days on the open ocean in a tiny 4 by 8 foot (1.2 by 2.4 m) raft, beginning their odyssey with no food or water stores and very few tools. They were found by Teleuka Iotua huddled in a hut belonging to Lakulaku Tutala on Loto villages reserve, where he gave them coconuts to drink. He then went and got more help. Shortly after their arrival a typhoon struck the island.

It was as fascinating as I had expected, and was different enough from Unbroken, which i also read recently, to still keep my attention. The only reason it lost a star is that the author gives away future facts in several places. For instance, at one point he states, \"that was the last food we would have.\" This changes the intensity of the remaining accounts of fishing and trying to catch birds, if you know they never ate again. Additionally, the author necessarily writes with the sound and vocabulary of the 1940s, but he also presents himself as the smartest, most in touch with his psyche, best navigator, etc. This may be true, but struck me as self-serving. Great book, though, and I highly recommend it!"}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2198250-nikki", "userReview": "Another truly amazing survival story (yes, I've been on a bit of a survival kick lately). A pilot and his two crew members crashed in the Pacific Ocean during WW II. The only thing they managed to get from the plane before it sank, was a 4 X 8' raft. They had no food, water, equipment, etc. and yet they survived for 34 days. It was fascinating to see their resourcefulness in getting food, water, navigation, etc. They eventually made it to an island where the natives helped them to regain their strength before they were able to contact their command. As the senior soldier, Trumbull really showed amazing leadership and mental strength.

The main storyline entails how Gene, Tony and Dixon survived 34 torching days with the scholdering heat and the shivering cold of night, on a 6 foot by 10 foot piercing yellow raft as bright as the sun.

The ingenuity and sailing skills of men who have nothing to work with, the challenges of surviving in the open ocean, and how the men dealt with the psychological stress, made it fascinating.
