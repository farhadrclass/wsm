I guess it\u2019s your lucky day (ha-ha - NOT). And just look at that bright and shiny 1 Star rating. That should be a sure fire way to earn me some new friends. If you\u2019re not interested in reading through my reasons behind not liking this book, here\u2019s the Cliff\u2019s Notes version of my reaction upon finishing . . . \nSo the long story of how I began my relationship with Kinsey Millhone at this late date is as follows: In general I am not a fan of books in a series. Added on to that fact, I already sold my soul broke my own rule for Janet Evanovich and her eleventy billion Plum stories. Friends were constantly telling me if I liked Stephanie Plum, I was sure to simply looooove Kinsey (basically because Kinsey supposedly had her shit together and wouldn\u2019t get kidnapped every 42 seconds). I kept fighting the good fight and said I wouldn\u2019t begin reading these books until I found \u201cA\u201d in hardback for wicked cheap. Well, I found A-F for a buck each.My rating started out at a solid 3 Stars (which is about as good as it gets from me when it comes to a light mystery like this). The premise was familiar, but still A-Okay in my book: Nikki is a recently-released-from-prison convicted murderer who shows up seeking Kinsey\u2019s help in order to find the true killer of her philandering husband. Kinsey takes the case and starts tracking down the various ex-Mrs. Fife\u2019s in order to piece part the crime together. It was all very . . . \nand I was digging it.\n\u201cHe was like some old tomcat, always sniffin\u2019 around the same back porch.\u201d\nBy the halfway point, though, I was really starting to struggle. There was just SO. MUCH. FILLER. This book could have easily been cut in half. Here are some examples (nickel\u2019s worth of free advice \u2013 drink a 5 Hour Energy before reading these quotes):\n\u201cThe interior was done with polished uneven red-tile flooring, mirrors floor to ceiling, and panels of raw gray wood, hung here and there with clusters of dried corn.\u201d\n\n \u201cThe roof was nearly flat, peppered with rocks, the iron railings sending streaks of rust down the sides of the building. The landscaping was rock and yucca and cactus plants.\u201d \n\nOh, and I can\u2019t forget all of the jogging:\n \u201cI jogged south on Wilshire, just for variety, cutting across to San Vicente at Twenty-sixth Street.\u201d \n\nAnd if Kinsey is supposed to have her shit together, then why is she the dumbest bitch EVER?!?!?! I mean, do y\u2019all remember what happens in this book???? \nI had been sitting at 2 Stars, but that ending? HELL NAH! 1 Star it is. I mean, I thought I had the whodunit it figured out right away, but I kept trying to convince myself I was wrong. I just had to be wrong. Sadly I wasn\u2019t. As for the rest of this series? Well, it can . . . \nMen authors get grief all the time for not writing quality women characters. Ms. Grafton should be forced to wear the cone of shame for eternity for writing someone as stupid as Kinsey. Give me back my Plum novels. At least she knows she\u2019s an idiot. Throw in some Hiassen for more guffaws, some Leonard in order to obtain some cool points, and some Lehane when I need some grit and I think I can easily live without ever taking another gander at Kinsey Millhone."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james", "userReview": "Review\n\n4 stars to A is for Alibi by Sue Grafton, the first book in the Kinsey Millhone private investigator cozy mystery series. It's the book that started it all for me...The opening lines of the book grab you when the narrator tells you that she killed a man. You want to know more about this situation. Then you get to know a little bit about Kinsey. Twice-divorced. 32. New to PI work. You already start to root for her as much as you ask questions about her former life.In this one, it's all about divorce and a cheating ex-husband. Nikki, not very likable, is released from prison and goes straight to Kinsey for help. She served time for killing her husband, but she claims she didn't do it. Years later, she wants answers so she can move on with her life. And she gets them. Kinsey finds a second body and actually has to protect herself. Right out of the gate, you know this series won't be a traditional cozy. But at the same time, it's a very formulaic story. And that's OK... I like those, too.Kinsey is mostly a good character. Her attitude is sometimes a little annoying. She is still learning her job to some degree... not quite as good as VI Warshawski, but not as silly as Stephanie Plum. Lots to like about her too... except no real family to speak of. She eventually has Henry, but not enough for me. The setting is Santa Teresa, California... a beautiful place among the vineyards and not too far from the ocean. Makes a good backdrop and some pretty scenes.For an intro book, it's strong. It was started back in the 1980s... so if you're looking for something more current, this series isn't for you.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.

She is hired by Nikki Fife, the convicted murdered of Lawrence Fife (her husband), to find out who really killed him. Her investigation leads her into a series of other murders that seem to be connected.I don't know if I can even justify one star on this book. I was at no point able to \"connect\" with Kinsey. I love a strong female character, but she does not fit that bill. She is crass which makes her seem uneducated and low-class. Attempts at presenting emotion from her were not believable; she simply came across as apathetic the entire novel. And how she could solve any crime with the amount of alcohol she consumed in this book is beyond me. Aside from the lack of dimension in her character, I am also not a fan of Grafton's writing style. This is the first book I've read of hers and from the get go, I was not impressed. At first I thought maybe I would try reading a couple of her books before I made a decision, but I don't think I could make it through another book of this caliber. The book was completely predictable. The outcome was obvious before you even hit the midpoint. Grafton tends to include pointless detail that does nothing to further the plot. And there are so many problems with the logic throughout the novel. For example, she says that Kinsey wipes down her Las Vegas hotel room to get rid of prints. Yet she paid her bill, SIGNED the bill and both owners of the hotel saw and talked to her. If she's trying to get rid of her presence in the hotel, she left an awfully bright trail...afterall, if someone were trying to establish she was there, wouldn't fingerprinting be further down the road from eyewitness accounts and paper records?This was definitely a let-down, and I will not be pursuing any further letters of the alphabet.

I wonder why the market suddenly felt the need for two female P.I.s. It was a very good thing anyway!!! Vic has been a favourite of mine for some time now but this is the first time I have tried this series by Sue Grafton and I did enjoy it. Kinsey's approach to detecting was reasonably realistic, I liked the old style feel to everything(was the 1980's really that long ago!) and the writing was good.

I thought of myself as suitably progressive when the novel described the main character wanting to date a guy, and putting on pantyhose. \"Wow?! A gay, cross-dressing detective? That's unique!\" Nope. Novel is totally about a woman instead. Don't know how I managed to make it halfway through the book before that lightbulb clicked on, but the absolutely hilarious part is that most of the men in the class apparently hadn't figured it out until the middle of the book either."}, {"userName": "Tea Jovanovi\u0107", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3103000-tea-jovanovi", "userReview": "Godinama sam poku\u0161avala da nagovorim srpske izdava\u010de da objavljuju ovu divnu autorku...

And Las Vegas Boulevard. Sorry wrong decade, but I was having a nostalgic Paul Simon moment, and I just couldn\u2019t turn it down. And yeah I figured I would use improper grammar and discreetly reference KINSEY AND ME: STORIES which I haven\u2019t yet read and I may never get to based on my current TBR shelf and future book endeavors. For those of you curious about the Paul Simon reference that would be \u201cMe and Julio Down by the Schoolyard,\u201d which graced the world with its presence in 1972 exactly 10 years before \u201cA\u201d IS FOR ALIBI was first published. If you\u2019re looking for another piece of random trivia, the first printing was 7,500 copies, of which about 6,000 were sold. Needless to say, Sue Grafton took a ride up mystery mountain (she didn\u2019t actually quit her day job until \u201cG\u201d IS FOR GUMSHOE\u201d) where she currently looks down at the rest of us mere mystery mortals and probably laughs occasionally. Or at least that\u2019s what I\u2019d do if I were her since I can smile and laugh on command. And we\u2019re back on track.What immediately struck me with this novel was the voice that popped off the page. Kinsey Millhone reminded me of the hardboiled voices of old, which isn\u2019t surprising since Ms. Grafton\u2019s strongest influence was Ross Macdonald. Being fascinated with mysteries of related titles, similar to John D. MacDonald and Harry Kemelman, led her to create a mystery series of linked titles and shackled her to one series and character for 26 books, 22 of which have been published as of this review. Of those, I have the first 15 on my Kindle, so Kinsey and I will be joined at the hip through letter O. But I\u2019ll be taking my time as I slowly meander my way up the mountain.In her first outing, Kinsey reminded me of a piece of wood that hadn\u2019t been sanded or varnished or even painted for that matter. I know there\u2019s a splinter in there somewhere, and if I poke around too long, I\u2019ll find it, or it\u2019ll find me. Either way, I\u2019ll need the tweezers, and there\u2019ll be more poking and prodding and I\u2019m probably not going to like that much either. But she does show promise and potential if she can just manage to get her house in order and sand off those rough edges. She\u2019s thirty-two years old and twice divorced, which means she has bad taste in men, or men unwisely choose her as marriage material, or she likes the thought of being married but doesn\u2019t like the whole commitment aspect. Based on the fact that she\u2019s a loner and unsentimental, I\u2019ll toss option C out the window. I haven\u2019t learned enough about her character to really give a definitive answer, but she does exhibit signs she might be a praying mantis or a tarantula. I don\u2019t really have a problem with her being slightly unlikable, since interest and intrigue keeps me turning the pages, and she does exhibit both qualities rather nicely.The plot felt a bit nebulous to me, instead of being compact and fully-formed. Sure, there\u2019s a murder\u2014well, multiple ones actually\u2014and there\u2019s a case of insurance fraud that Kinsey investigates, but it all proved a bit simpler than I would have liked. Maybe it was the climax and ending that whipped me completely out of alignment, with their rifle-like resolutions where my ears were still ringing from the blasts.While this is Kinsey\u2019s story, her female compatriots\u2014Gwen and Nikki Fife and Sharon Napier and even Marcia Threadgill, whose boobs \u201csagged down like flesh melons bursting through the bottom of a string bag\u201d\u2014proved more interesting than the male counterparts, who always seemed about a half mile behind and rather worse for wear.I\u2019m interested enough to continue on with the series, especially since Ms. Grafton is a three-time Anthony and Shamus Award winner and is a recipient of the Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America. But I won\u2019t rush right to my Kindle and pop open the next book.Cross-posted at Robert's Reads"}, {"userName": "Erin \u2615 *Proud Book Hoarder*", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3048260-erin-proud-book-hoarder", "userReview": "\u201cMy own mystery, unplumed, undetected, was sorted into files that were neatly labeled but really didn't say much.\u201d Kinsey Millhone, an average detective with a conscience and a relaxed lifestyle, lands a whopper of a case to open this first of many, many books. Her client's wishes? To find out who really killed her husband AFTER she's released from prison for doing the deed.Mildly paced with other mediocre tension, the book mainly wins through the point of view of the detective. She's a down-to-earth, relatable protagonist. Divorced and eager to help solve crimes for the underdog, even if she doesn't go to those cases intentionally, her thorough skills show a mystery where the clues are solved by actual logical work and not just nifty clue falling into her lap like most mysteries do. We get to go through random phone calls, ponderings of a next step, legwork, and misleading interviews. Good old detective classics.While Kinsey is likable, she's not a detective I fell in love with. You could enter any other detective and get this technique and outcome. The writing style puts in enjoyable humor in serious situations, but it's mainly kept to the point and focused on the story at hand. The ending wasn't a surprise because it had been bouncing in the back of my head as a possibility, but it still dealt an ending that was the shine of the story. I won't be forgetting the twist of who it was and how no one is safe from being the big bad villain.I'd have liked to have a follow-up and longer ending that shows the after-effects, especially Nikki learning what really went down that fateful night years ago, but oh well. A good mystery for those who did modern golden-age detectives."}, {"userName": "Sandy *The world could end while I was reading and I would never notice*", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30817744-sandy-the-world-could-end-while-i-was-reading-and-i-would-never-notice", "userReview": "EXCERPT: My name is Kinsey Millhone. I 'm a private investigator, licensed by the state of California. I'm thirty-two years old, twice divorced, no kids. The day before yesterday I killed someone, and the fact weighs heavily on my mind. ABOUT THIS BOOK: A IS FOR AVENGERA tough-talking former cop, private investigator Kinsey Millhone has set up a modest detective agency in a quiet corner of Santa Teresa, California. A twice-divorced loner with few personal possessions and fewer personal attachments, she's got a soft spot for underdogs and lost causes.A IS FOR ACCUSEDThat's why she draws desperate clients like Nikki Fife. Eight years ago, she was convicted of killing her philandering husband. Now she's out on parole and needs Kinsey's help to find the real killer. But after all this time, clearing Nikki's bad name won't be easy.A IS FOR ALIBI If there's one thing that makes Kinsey Millhone feel alive, it's playing on the edge. When her investigation turns up a second corpse, more suspects, and a new reason to kill, Kinsey discovers that the edge is closer--and sharper--than she imagined.MY THOUGHTS: Is there anyone out there who has never read one of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone books? I have, at some point, read most of the earlier ones in the series. This, the very first, is, I still believe, one of the best of the series. I plan on working my way through the full series eventually. They are not particularly gripping, or shocking. But they are good in a comfortable way. You don't have to concentrate, or go back and replay bits. It is what it is. I am going to miss Sue Grafton. Like a comfortable pair of slippers. I listened to the audiobook of A Is For Alibi by Sue Grafton, narrated by Mary Peiffer and published by Books on Tape via OverDrive.

I. Warshawski could go toe-to-toe with the bad guys and more than hold their own with their male counterparts like Spenser, Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe.Millhone has a modest solo practice as a P.I. that she runs out of a small office in the fictional town of Santa Teresa, California. Orphaned as a child and twice divorced, she lives a quiet, solitary life, eschewing the kinds of possessions and personal connections that most people take for granted. But this is her life and she's perfectly happy with it. Certainly she would never be mistaken for Miss Marple or Jessica Fletcher. And unlike any number of other female sleuths, she is perfectly capable of solving difficult mysteries without the assistance of a cat. Enter Nikki Fife, recently released after an eight-year stint in prison for murdering her husband. One might wonder why Nikki got only eight years for a premeditated murder, but this is never explained. Nikki continues to insist that she was innocent and she hires Kinsey to find the Real Killer. The husband, Laurence Fife, was a philandering attorney with a loose moral code who had antagonized any number of potential suspects. But the police and prosecutors argued that only Nikki could have poisoned one of Laurence's allergy capsules and she was thus convicted on this rather flimsy evidence.Kinsey takes the case and almost immediately discovers that there was a lot more going on in the case than the police and prosecutors revealed at the time of the trial. To make matters worse, as soon as Millhone begins poking around, people with ties to the case start turning up dead, and before long, Kinsey may find herself in the line of fire.This is a good introduction to a series that would develop very long legs and attract a huge fan base. Thirty years after the publication of \"A\" Is for Alibi, Kinsey Millhone still soldiers on and Grafton has nearly reached the end of the alphabet. Some have questioned Grafton's decision to leave her protagonist and these stories glued to the 1980s, and the books have become, as a practical matter, historical crime novels in which there are still no personal computers, cell phones or Internet and where the heroine remains perpetually in her middle thirties. But Grafton has attracted legions of fans to the series, so she must be doing something right.

After my aunt recommended it, I decided to check out her infamous alphabet series.Kinsey Millhone is a former cop, a twice divorcee, and a private investigator. Nikki Fife, a woman accused, convicted, and imprisoned for murdering her philandering husband, Laurence Fife, has just been released on parole and wants her name cleared. She comes to Kinsey, who takes the case and begins the slow process of unraveling the truth hidden by eight years.Good:No one can say that Sue Grafton skips over the description. She details the surroundings, the people, Kinsey's thoughts, and more very much so that the setting and circumstances are real.Kinsey is a unique protagonist, and the first person point of view is perfect for her. We get an intimate look into her mind as she interviews the suspects and slowly unravels the mystery. Also, I enjoyed seeing Kinsey doing more than one investigation. All too often, in books, movies, and TV, we see investigators focusing solely on one mystery at a time. This book portrays it in a more realistic fashion.Lastly, the final few chapters rush together into intense, edge-of-your-seat action. And the ending is a surprise--sort of.Bad:First off, Kinsey Millhone comes off as less a person and more a vehicle for telling the story. Her personal feelings appear so infrequently that I began to feel that she was truly emotionless. The narrative is delivered in a matter-of-fact manner, which is nice, but please, show some emotion! Give an opinion! Quit hiding behind descriptions! Furthermore, Kinsey frequently acts very masculine. I had to remind myself on numerous occasions that she was a woman. And since the author is obviously a woman, this is rather sad (I have read better female perspectives from men!). Add to that how often the woman drinks (three glasses of wine at least in one day--see pages 227, 244, 248!), and I wonder how she's not an alcoholic.Other characters are poor. Arlette is treated like a stupid fat person. Nikki is as unemotional and unreachable as Kinsey. Charlotte is a drunk. Gwen is a little better but not much. Charlie drove me up the wall, and the others are just too minor.Another bothersome aspect is that the story really doesn't kick in until 130 pages into the book. The first 130 pages detail lots of backstory, interviewing everyone and his/her mother, and pretty much anything that had nothing to do with the mystery. All this could have easily taken half that time. In the about 200 pages, Kinsey has jogged/run at least 4 times, slept about as many times, has drunk many times that many glasses of alcohol (as I mentioned previously), has flirted three times with Charlie, has called Charlie at least that many, has driven all over southern California and Nevada, has gotten sick in Las Vegas, has checked into three motels, and has stumbled upon a murder. Yes, she has interviewed almost a dozen people, but has she really learned anything in that time? Not much, really.As if this wasn't bad enough, the mystery is really not all that spectacular. It had the potential of being interesting, but Grafton failed to take the opportunity to bring it to the next level (mostly because she writes it so that Kinsey doesn't really do anything until the last 20 pages). Most of Kinsey's investigating involves convenient guessing. Kinsey doesn't really surface any evidence, nor does she glean anything really important from all her interviews. She just happens to make very good guesses.Lastly, Kinsey's relationship with Charlie is absolutely insane. I mean, it is so completely obvious from the first introduction (how \"sexual\" Charlie was) that Grafton planned on throwing these two together. Grafton does a poor job of giving the couple chemistry, other than a few obligatory sex scenes. If Kinsey is supposed to be such a professional, why does she completely forget conflict of interests and sleep with a suspect? And why does it take her almost 250+ pages to figure this out?Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Expect a lot of da**, he**, sh**, and our favorite f-word.Every situation that Sharon Napier is in requires several sexual comments that may or may not be explicit. Charlie Scorsoni, Colin Fife (a 12-year-old child), and numerous other people (Henry, etc.) are said to exude sexuality (another aggravating part). Laurence Fife had committed adultery several times before his death. Several others have extra-marital relations.Violence is remarkably tame. Three people are murdered (one via hit-and-run), but the descriptions are vague. A security locker is broken into.Overall:The first few chapters were pretty good. But I could never quite get into the book. I really couldn't associate with Kinsey, the mystery was ho-hum (straight out of an 80's TV series), and the other characters were unremarkable. If I ever do read anymore of these books, I will definitely read more reviews to get a better idea of what I am in store for. And I will definitely take my aunt's recommendation with a grain of salt."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda", "userReview": "When Nikki Fife appeared on her doorstep, Private Investigator Kinsey Millhone was surprised to see her.

Though I love the series, the first book did have some issues. I think at times the book's flow got a bit rough. And the characters are not very developed yet. Grafton gives a short description of Kinsey. It takes a lot of books to find out about her last, how she came to live with her aunt, and her past marriages. Getting the build up to all of that is wonderful though.Kinsey at the time of his book is 32 and twice divorced. A private investigator who is able to pay the bills. She is hired by a woman who was convicted of murdering her husband. The woman claimed she is innocent and wants to find out who really killed her husband. Kindly ends up investigating this and another case of a young woman who also died by the same means. We get broad strokes to other characters we will get to know later on the series like Henry Pitts, Rosie, and Lieutenant Dolan. I do wish we had a chance to spend more time with them in this first book, but Grafton focuses on the case that Kinsey is working as well as a romance that comes out of nowhere. The writing was really good. Though as I said the flow was a bit off towards the end. I recall reading this the first time and being shocked by how the two cases were wrapped up. It's been years since I read this, so even this time I found myself pleasantly surprised again. I enjoy the setting of Santa Teresa and it sounds ideal at times. The series takes place here and though the years may change, Santa Teresa is the main setting.Kinsey goes through a life changing event in this one, that scars her a bit going into B is for Burglar."}, {"userName": "Ingrid", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6181069-ingrid", "userReview": "3.5 starsNo. 1 in a series I had planned to start reading for ages.

The reading by Judy Kaye was pretty good, too. To quote John Prine, it was \"Pretty good, not bad. I can't complain, but actually, everything was pretty much the same.\" IOW, it was as standard a mystery thriller as I've ever read. Nothing to rant or rave about, which makes it eminently forgettable, yet still enjoyable enough.The heroine, Kinsey, is a private detective who is hired to look into an old murder by the woman who served time for the crime. Grafton's serviceable prose leads us through the investigation, introducing us to the characters & outlining a standard plot. While there aren't any great surprises or twists, she didn't do anything horribly wrong, either. Kinsey is a fairly likeable, realistic heroine & her investigation is quite mundane.One of the draws of this sort of story for me is to identify with the hero/heroine. I never really did that with Kinsey, even though she tells the story. It might just be the difference in sex & a woman might really like these books.I'll listen to B is for Burglar fairly soon because it is a relaxing read for my commute.

As a whole, though, I love this series. Sure, it's total pulp fiction, but it's enjoyable nonetheless. First, the series is based in Santa Teresa, CA, a very thinly disguised Santa Barbara, which makes it great fun for anyone who's lived in SB. (My *favorite* alteration is that Mission Street become Missile Street!) Second, Kinsey Millhone is your prototypical (stereotypical?) hard-boiled female PI. I respect authors that give us detectives who are actually detectives and who don't just accidentally stumble into murder plots everywhere they go, even if Kinsey does have to mention in every book that PIs don't usually have this much excitement. Kinsey is great fun, and fairly *real*. It's not a perfect series, and I do wish that Grafton would either write more quickly or allow Kinsey to live life in between books so that we wouldn't be stuck in the '80s with these books, but it's a good read."}, {"userName": "Jamise // Spines & Vines", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13111928-jamise-spines-vines", "userReview": "This was my first Sue Grafton book.

I don't read mysteries as a regular thing, and I don't know why I first picked up the Kinsey Millhone books, back when she was only on C or D. They were steady sellers at the feminist bookstore where I worked, but I didn't buy them. I listened to them on my Walkman on cassette tapes I borrowed from the library.That's right, folks. I'm old. Be nice or I'll start telling you horror stories about being right in the middle of a good scene and then having your cassette player start spewing narrow black magnetic tape all over the place.Anyway. Kinsey Millhone is smart and tough and self-reliant. I'm plodding and soft and often cripplingly anxious. She's single and childless and solves mysteries; I've been married since the late fifteenth century, homeschool my son, and kill houseplants. And yet I feel a certain affinity with Millhone. Why is that?1. We're both broke in rich cities named after saints. Kinsey's native Santa Teresa is based on Santa Barbara. I live in Santa Monica. Both towns used to be places where modestly lower-middle-class people could scrape by in cheap digs near the sea. Kinsey and I have dug in our heels and stayed stubbornly in the same tiny apartments we moved into decades ago. Meanwhile, our neighbors have moved away and been replaced by rich arrogant boobs.Granted, Kinsey's apartment is adorable and her landlord is charming and nurturing, while my apartment drives me nuts and my landlord is condescending and sexist. Still. I like having a little something in common with a bona fide badass, even if she's technically fictional.2. Neither of us knows what to do with our hair. Kinsey takes the nail scissors to her head once a month or so. I let my hair grow and grow and grow in the hope that gravity will take pity on me and do something about this mop. It hasn't worked yet, and I'm going to have to go in for a trim at some point. Possibly a professional will insist on trying to inflict a \"hairstyle\" on me. But I'm not ready to give up just yet. Maybe I'll buy a pair of nail scissors instead.3. Neither of us gets along with dogs. And we're both well aware that the problem isn't the dogs but the owners who let them lunge, snarl, bark, and/or make passionate love to strangers' legs. Said owners always look either indifferent, indulgent, or surprised. \"Oh, my gosh \u2013 he never does this!\" (Lady, he did \"this\" five seconds ago, to the last pedestrian who made the mistake of being on the same sidewalk as the two of you. Apparently owning a dog induces short-term memory loss. Not that I'm bitter or anything.)4. We're both joggers who hate jogging. Okay, maybe \"hate\" is too strong a word. But we're definitely not big fans of the exercise. We do it purely for fitness reasons. Both of us want to be prepared, because we never know when we might be called on to be strong and fast. Kinsey often needs to flee for her life, or in pursuit of a perp; I often have to sprint after an errant pet lizard, or down the stairs to throw one last sock into a load of wash that already started. 5. We're both used to basing our lives around the horrors of L.A. traffic. You don't have to live in Los Angeles proper to suffer from the fact that of the roughly 300 million people currently making America their home, 100 million of them are clogging up the 405 freeway at any given time. The fallout has already spread past the city, into the county, and beyond, and it's only a matter of time before my best friend in Idaho starts having to budget an extra half-hour if she wants to drive somewhere. Anywhere. To Canada, even.6. We both love junk food but hate jelly doughnuts. Kinsey Millhone is a fast-food aficionado. I recently managed to lose 15 pounds without ever giving up on the idea that dessert is not only a daily necessity, but possibly a civil right. Neither of us would profane our temples with a jelly doughnut unless starvation was the only alternative. And, last but not least:7. We're judgmental smart-mouths.And Kinsey's hilariously matter-of-fact about it.Marcia Threadgill was twenty-six years old and she suffered from bad taste.She's not even being mean. She's just pointing it out.Can't imagine why I relate so hard to that."}, {"userName": "Ace", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23405868-ace", "userReview": "The first in the series of Kinsey Millhone, she is s a bit of a character, down to earth and low maintenance, I think I could be friends with her.

Kinsey is a private investigator who is asked to look into an old murder case \u2013 by the woman convicted of poisoning her unfaithful husband. Nikki Fife has served her time but she swears she was innocent and wants to know who DID kill her husband. As Kinsey begins looking into the old case she discovers that a young accountant who did the law firm\u2019s books also died shortly after Nikki\u2019s husband \u2013 and of the same poison. The more details she uncovers, the less they seem to fit together, and possible witnesses begin to die. This is a fast-paced mystery thriller with plenty of twists and turns and multiple suspects to keep the reader busy. Kinsey is a wonderful lead character \u2013 something of a loner, twice divorced no kids, no pets, working hard and working smart. She\u2019s resourceful, tenacious, and intelligent and can take care of herself. I like that the book is set in an era before wide-spread use of computers, and without cell phones. This requires Kinsey to investigate the old-fashioned way (does anyone else remember using a reverse directory?). The book is very atmospheric. Grafton describes the Southern California landscape clearly and succinctly, giving the reader a good sense of the terrain. I also like the way she describes the various characters; I got a very clear picture of each of them. Mary Peiffer performs the audiobook at a good pace. She does not use many different voices for the various characters, but that wasn\u2019t too problematic. Grafton\u2019s dialogue makes it clear who is speaking and I was never confused. I\u2019ve read this book before \u2013 decades ago. I didn\u2019t remember anything about it other than that I liked the central character.

A prominent divorce attorney with a reputation for single-minded ruthlessness on behalf of his clients, Fife was also rumored to be a dedicated philanderer.
