The writing it good (of course) and the sentences are amazingly wry and pithy sometimes but he is not trying here for some outstanding work of autobiography. The narrative meanders and name-drops and lets you in on how and where he came about writing his greatest works. It is for that later point that I loved this book. Reading it on its own without having read Bowles would not probably be that great an experience but if you are already into this great writer/musician then this book will only add to your Bowles appreciation."}, {"userName": "Patrick McCoy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/678506-patrick-mccoy", "userReview": "I have long been an admirer of the American author, composer, and poet Paul Bowles. I have read almost all that he has written so I felt it was time to to read his autobiography, Without Stopping (1972). Bowles lived a very interesting life, but I must admit that the first third of the book-the parts about his early life were not very interesting for me. The second third explained about his artistic aspirations as a composer and poet and also show how his wanderlust developed. This was interesting about his protegee-mentor relationship with Aaron Copland came about. I also learned about all the travel he did in Europe and later in Mexico and Latin America. However, it was the final third, that was largely about his artistic life and travels in Morocco and Ceylon (Sri Lanka), which most captivated me. Apparently Jane Bowles called it \"Without Telling\"-since he kept his and her homosexuality out of the book. I think it can be inferred if one reads between the lines. Bowles was close with all the major homosexual literary stars of the day-Tennessee Williams, Gore Vidal, Truman Capote, William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, etc. Many of his travels were with men and Jane at home and she had many companions of the same sex that lived with or near them in many of the reminiscences. I was more disappointed that he glossed over inspirations for his terrifying novels and short stories. He was more concerned about completion and drafting of these books than the actual inception or inspiration for them. He was a consummate name dropper, but he knew many of the leading literary star so the 20th century-from Gertrude Stein who encouraged his to visit Morocco for the first time to the Beats poets and writers who came calling on this leading literary godfather in Tangiers. I also can relate to his endless curiosity for other cultures and travel: I had the illusion of being about to add another country, another culture, to my total experience, and the further illusion that to do so would in itself be of value. My curiosity about alien cultures was avid and obsessive. I had a placid belief that it was goof or me to live in the midst of people whose motives I did not understand; this unreasoned conviction was clearly an attempt to legitimize my curiosity.I can see that his relationship with Jane was something that was very important to him as well, this relates to Jane's slow decline and eventual death: The act of living had been enjoyable; at some point when I was not paying attention, it had turned into a different sort of experience, to whose grimness I had grown so accustomed that I now took it for granted.Here are a couple of other choice quotes that sum up this very interesting man and his equally interesting life: Since this state of affairs is axiomatic, it follows that writing an autobiography is not the kind of work one would expect most writers to enjoy doing. And it is clear that telling what happened does not necessarily make a good story. In my tale, for instance, there are no dramatic victories because there was no struggle. I hung on and waited. It seems to me that this must be what most people do; the occasions when there is the possibility of doing more than that are becoming rare indeed. One culture's therapy is another culture's torture."}, {"userName": "Vel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2644615-vel", "userReview": "Merciless."}, {"userName": "Chad", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/558525-chad", "userReview": "You can always find good bits in a good writer's writing memoir. Unfortunately, Bowles' autobiography spends more time between travel lists and gossipy paragraph-long anecdotes about all the famous writers and composers and artists he spent time with. Oddly tedious for a writer capable of the drugged out Moroccan cult scene in Let it Come Down. Still, I enjoyed his childhood recollections and bits like this scene with his wife, Jane:In the spring we returned to Fez and stayed at the Belvedere. I was completing The Sheltering Sky, and Jane was deep into her novella Camp Cataract. At the break of day we would have breakfast in bed in Jane\u2019s room. Then I would go into my own room, leaving the door open so that we could communicate if we wanted. At one point she had a terrible time with a bridge she was trying to build over a gorge. She would call out: \u201cBupple! What\u2019s a cantilever, exactly?\u201d or \u201cCan you say a bridge has buttresses?\u201d I, immersed in the writing of my final chapters, would answer anything that occurred to me, without coming out of my voluntary state of obsession. She would be quiet for a while, and then call out again. The rushing of the stream directly beneath our windows covered all but the most penetrating sounds; communications had to be fairly important to make it worthwhile shouting them. After three or four mornings I became aware that something was wrong: she was still at the bridge. I got up and went into her room. We talked for a while about the problem, and I confessed my mystification. \u201cWhy do you have to construct the damned thing?\u201d I demanded. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just say it was there and let it go at that?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know how it was built, I can\u2019t see it.\u201dThis struck me as incredible. It never had occurred to me that such considerations could enter into the act of writing. Perhaps for the first time I had an inkling of what Jane meant when she remarked, as she often did, that writing was \u201cso hard.\u201d (pp. 286-7 / Chapter XIV)"}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5879865-mark", "userReview": "Paul Bowles is an incredibly complex character. A composer who studied with Aaron Copland and was a close friend, (and with Henry Cowell, in the SF Bay Area)- an author, who was a contemporary and friend of Gertrude Stein, and as well, a friend and colleague of Kerouac, Corso, Burroughs, and Ginsberg. Not the least of his attraction, to me, was his time as resident expatriate-at-large and expert to the Rolling Stones glitterati set, encouched in fumes of hashish and plates of majoun, and, last but not least, an eminent field researcher of Moroccan ethnic music, responsible for bringing Brian Jones (thru Brion Gyson) to record the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka music... although this edition ends just before that period (about 1968). Now all that said, it's rather amusing to learn that Bowles (and wife) were, for a couple of years, Stalinist apologists for the Communist Party USA. Even to the point of his taking hundreds \"Muerte a Trotsky\" posters down to Mexico to distribute amongst \"the proletariat\"... who knows how much that may have had with Trotsky's death, one is left to muse, since Bowles never mentions that. Americans who become Marxist and Communist lack a sense of humor since they're too busy murdering their class enemies to laugh at (or with) life. And besides, it was a dustbin philosophy as lame as fascism, yet, every bit just as attractive.Well, what perhaps saves Bowles from ignominy as a Stalinist Commie on the wrong side at the wrong time, is that he writes damn good, succinct, interesting stories. His music, I've decided is pretty lame, tame, for the most part, but then again, his music itself was a product of its time. Even so, this is one writer who holds his own amongst all his contemporaries. I suppose we can place him close to Lawrence Durrell for his sage writing on the Mediterranean environment and culture."}, {"userName": "JASON CUPP", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1071437-jason-cupp", "userReview": "in \"without stopping\", paul bowles recounts the details of his extraordinary life like a man holding a garden-hose; looking down at the limp flow of water with as much enthusiasm as one has for giving a shrub a drink. he states: \"writing an autobiography is an ungratifying occupation at best.\" he simply recalls his memories without aggrandizing.  the steady trickle of events is not without hilarious (though, still dead-panned) surprises: \"during my childhood i had been good-natured and unusually tractable, but subject to occasional bursts of temper. as i grew more devious and circumspect, the rages ceased to occur. it was natural for me to assume that i would cease to be visited by them. thus, at the age of nineteen, i was astonished one night to discover that i had just thrown a meat knife at my father.\"  for my part, reading the recount, i was enthralled. 'without stopping' serves as a travelogue where each location is made exotic by its people; be they the colorful, encountered natives, or people who appear as acquaintances that have since graduated into the world-wide culture canon.besides stoking my desire to see north africa, this book makes me wonder how famous the artists, musicians, and writers around me will someday become."}, {"userName": "metaphor", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5685453-metaphor", "userReview": "\" Nothing's so much fun as games you play with your own mind,\" Mother said one day. \"You think you're running your mind, but then you find out that unless you're careful, your mind is running you.

Don't know what to say, other than I guess I expected something more. It's interesting from a documentary perspective, but one of the maddening things about Bowles for me is the utter inaccessibility of his person, as opposed to his writing. I get almost no sense of him from the introductions to his novels, his stories, from interviews; I feel like he is a total enigma, off having some profound experience somewhere and telling me to fuck off. Maybe that's why I find his fiction so emotionally devastating. Well...whatever. This autobiography was disappointing for that reason; I just felt like there wasn't any soul to it. It seemed very much like he was writing this not because he wanted to, but because someone else had put him up to it. There was the same feeling to me about his book Days A Tangier Diary.
