Now I got the chance and I'm afraid it wasn't the best experience ever.I found the story a bit confusing towards the end, and that was a disappointment because the whole action was all jumbled. I got the idea of what happened, but I am afraid that I may have lost something in the confusion of narrators' voices. I couldn't understand if it was Daniel's voice or the omniscient narrator's voice from Alice's parts that was being used.This messy ending ruined the story for me. I won't say that I was finding it a great story, but it was dark and entertaining enough to keep me going. Then, that end, confusing as it was, made this story a complete letdown.On the positive side, however, it was a relief to read a story in which vampires are vicious, cruel, with a lust for blood. Fortunately, there are no vampires falling in love with a human being in this book."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "Split between the 1940s and a modern narrative (1980s/90s?), The Evil Seed tells of the havoc wreaked in the lives of two sets of characters by a beautiful and ruthless 'nightwalker'. (Basically a vampire, although this kind doesn't conform to many of the popular myths, eg being unable to venture out in daylight.) In 1948, Cambridge scholar Daniel Holmes rescues a girl called Rosemary from drowning; he falls madly in love, only for her to start a relationship with his best friend. His story, charting a gradual descent into obsession and madness, is written as a journal. In the modern narrative, also set in Cambridge, an artist named Alice is disconcerted when her ex-boyfriend Joe asks her to offer a spare room to his strange new girlfriend, the ethereal Ginny. The Evil Seed was Joanne Harris's first novel, reissued after her success with Chocolat etc, and the author's foreword suggests she is now somewhat embarrassed by it. It's easy to see why: it is frequently amateurish and the style doesn't seem to have much in common with her later work (although, only having read two other books by Harris, I'm not an expert). Many of the events stretch the limits of plausibility, to say the least - I'm not talking about the vampire stuff, but things like Joe expecting Alice to let Ginny stay in her house (who would ever do this?!), and Joe seeming completely unfazed at the idea that Ginny might be a heroin addict, as if such a thing is no big deal. The characters' emotions are all over the place and they often contradict themselves several times during the course of a few pages.That said, I still enjoyed this. It's atmospheric, compelling and fun, and although I would have preferred a more subtle approach (it definitely descends into horror towards the end), there's enough gothic intrigue to keep it genuinely interesting. I don't think I can really say that I would recommend it, but I never wanted to give up on it, and I don't regret reading it either. I wanted it to distract me from certain things I don't want to think about at the moment, and it did its job rather well."}, {"userName": "Annalisa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16578404-annalisa", "userReview": "Joanne Harris considera questo libro un po' come il suo figlio negletto, e lo scrive in una nota introduttiva.Io non la vedo cos\u00ec.

I\u2019ve been known to buy books based on less than the above mentioned things. But this, I must admit, having spent a day reading most of it, was such a great story I was sad to see it end. From the start I was captivated by Alice, who makes her living from art. There is a scene where the author describes Alice at work, painting a scene of ethereal beauty, so immersed in her work she forgets herself or the time and I thought, how very much like Joanne Harris she is, because I was so engrossed in this book I wasn\u2019t able to put it down and I was surprised to see hours had passed and I hadn\u2019t moved from my chair on the balcony under the mango tree, because this book had me under a spell. There\u2019s a dreamy quality to the writing, a Gothic thread running through the whole story, and it turns and twists bringing new elements to the surface. The story is told from the point of view of two narrators, Daniel Holmes, whose tale begins after the Second World War, and Alice, who bring the story into present day. I liked how their experiences were like two halves that joined together made it complete. Their stories have a central point \u2013 Rosemary, the young girl of ethereal beauty who brings destruction and death wherever she is. There were times when I wondered if Rosemary wasn\u2019t a victim herself, condemned never to rest, bringing tragedy to all the men who loved her, and they, in return, not being able to let go of her, commit the sin that will bring about a new cycle of destruction. And so it goes, a wheel within a wheel, unbroken in time, because to truly break it would mean forgetting and they can\u2019t do that, no one who has known her can. I have another book by Joanne Harris, Blueeyedboy, bought years ago on a whim because I had always wanted to read something by the author of Chocolat, a movie I loved even if I haven\u2019t read the book. I\u2019m now glad that I started with this because it only made me want to read more of her work. I was surprised to see quite a few negative reviews on goodreads, people complaining of this and that, how certain elements are not believable. Oh well, if you can\u2019t suspend your disbelief (remember, this is a vampire novel), then maybe this is not the book for you.I\u2019m glad this is the kind of novel where vampires are old (in age only, of course), cruel and beautiful and at the same time as vulnerable as they are ferocious in their hunger. I wish there was a sequel. I wish I knew who Rosemary truly was and where she was born and how she came to be such a destructive force over such a long time. But even if I will never know her whole story, I can still love the book because like all good stories, it\u2019s made of shadow and light and the shadow is intriguing enough that whatever comes into the light is enough to make it unforgettable.I will remember\u2026"}, {"userName": "Steven Naude", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10376117-steven-naude", "userReview": "Joanne Harris can take the story of the hare and the tortoise as her raw material and use this to construct a majestic novel. In this case it is a potentially very lame theme of vampirism. But in her hands it becomes a three-generation saga with mystery, intrigue and perfectly formed characters - no werewolves, no glistening skin and no crap. In fact the characters and plot are the focus, not the clich\u00e9\u2019s about vampires. There is blood and gore but it is not gratuitous. As with all her work the plot twists and turns into corners where you cannot imagine a solution, but somehow (and credibly) she adds a simple new twist and we are back on track. She is a master story teller and this is the fourth of her books that I have enjoyed. I like the way she thinks almost as much as her unequalled use of descriptive language - surely unique in this genre. Both narrators are outstanding and I would highly recommend this set."}, {"userName": "Paula", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3720054-paula", "userReview": "My friend gave me 'The Evil Seed' as a gift.

As in 'Sleep, Pale Sister' I notice that the female characters were alot more stronger than the male characters, I do not know if this occurs in Joanne Harris's other books (I will need to find out), I found it refreshing to read such strong female characters, the male characters are dependable, which for me created a good balance.A truly scary gothic book, I loved the setting (Cambridge), I truly believe 'The Evil Seed' would make an excellent film."}, {"userName": "Alice", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1632342-alice", "userReview": "I wouldn't normally read books about vampires and I was disappointed by this book.

I liked this book however I didn't liked that much. The things that I really loved in this one were the atmosphere and the scenerio and also how Joanne Harris used vampires. It wasn't a cheesy vampire's story, thank god (I wouldn't probably handle it to be honest). Towards Rosemary/Ginny I have these hate and \"love\" feelings, you see, she manipulated people and made them love her at the point that they would risk their lives to protect her, it was her plan of course. Like this I kind of liked her because she had power, she knew how to play and survive. However, the way she pretended to be innocent and made others sound like they were wrong made me kind of hating her. I really liked Daniel, he loved her but he would be able to kill her to end his suffering, I think. Joe and Robert were just blind. One thing is right for sure: love can blind us. Somehow I liked very much Rafe, don't ask me why. Perhaps he made me think of Dorian Gray, they aren't alike but Rafe made me remember Dorian and that amused me.It wasn't my first book of Joanne Harris but I can say that her writing style developed very well. The dark atmospheres are a common thing in her other books and it makes me really happy; I love how she describes it. And I think this is all I have to say...

Yeats: my wretched dragon is perplexed.Word of warning; this will only be a MINI book review, rather than a full book review, because I think the writing in this novel reflects something that is only 'halfway there'.The Evil Seed is an often confusing. sometimes numbing and other times flamboyantly lovely read - a strange hybrid of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"Lesbian Vampire\" poem 'Christabel', and the videoclip of Guns n Roses 'November Rain', with a sprinkling of The Secret History and a couple of Interview with the Vampire remarks. Unfortunately, the originality, creativity and unique books of all such mediums referred to in the previous sentence are lost in the inexperience of Harris' first attempt at writing.The novel intrudes on the mind of uni student and artist Alice at a vulnerable time - she is reminiscing about her former romantic relationship with Joe, but suddenly she finds herself having to house the new girl he is besotted with: Ginny. Ginny is like the hottest Kate Bush you ever did see, and perfects the look of 'Little Girl Lost'. But her friends are kinda weird - it takes three invitations for them to step across a door threshold into your house, and they only like to come over at night, if at all possible.At first, Alice believes that jealousy is the culprit responsible for her ill feelings towards Ginny, but when she finds an old diary of a gentleman's run in with a Kate Bush vampire, Alice begins to suspect that the truth about Ginny may be very sinister indeed...Joanne Harris, the author of such mini masterpieces as Chocolat, wrote this book when she was a fresh, impressionable 23 year old. She admits herself that she struggled with the idea that the book should be republished, once she became famous and everything. And I have to be frank and say I understand her concerns. I could see glimpses of the glorious, but overall I felt that lingering university student angst, that 90s love for gothica in its darkest and most grunge-like form and a sense of an author that hadn't quite found her voice just yet.This book is, overall, romantic and lusty and bloody. The vampires (though they are never referred to as this, only 'Nightwalkers') are of the monstrous, ravaging type. They can hypnotise and manipulate people into doing whatever they please, and they appear to live only for hunger and fear.At times the writing screamed for simplicity, and instead was overwritten, but I enjoyed the Byronic character of Daniel (diary guy), though the modern-day Alice lesser so. This was a little too dark, musty and derivative to be a great read, but I still consider it to be a good read, particularly if you like books like Wuthering Heights, or Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and require a quick fix of packet blood. Yeah, I know it's not as good as the live stuff. But hey, even vampires can't have home-cooked gourmet every night. And as far as takeaways go this stuff aint devoid of your daily dose o' vitamins.

Per quanto mi riguarda ho letto solamente un\u2019altra serie new gothic e, relativamente a questo romanzo, ho trovato alcuni puntoi di contatto fra lo stile fascinoso ma un po\u2019 vago della Harris e quello di Libba Bray l\u2019autrice della Triologia di Gemma Doyle. Come ho gi\u00e0 detto non posso valutare lo stile attuale della scrittrice ma rimedier\u00f2, senza dubbio.Tornando al romanzo, come ho gi\u00e0 detto quello che mi ha particolarmente colpito \u00e8 la semplicit\u00e0 della trama. I colpi di scena sono minimi e in alcuni tratti perfino scontati.

Possiamo conoscere, anche se in minima parte, il suo passato, vivere il suo presente ed immaginare il suo futuro.\u00c8 una vampira nel senso stretto del termine che affascina e cattura gli uomini e li rende psicologicamente e fisicamente suoi schiavi con metodologia e indolenza. Anno dopo anno, vittima dopo vittima Rosemary, Mary o Ginny cattura l\u2019interessa ed il cuore di un uomo che rende suo, fino alla morte.In alcuni punti si percepisce chiaramente che il romanzo \u00e8 stato ritoccato successivamente, come se l\u2019autrice ripresolo in mano, decidesse di dare alcune brevi ed incisive pennellate per raddrizzare qualche mancanza giovanile. Il tutto, purtroppo, rallenta un po\u2019 la scorrevolezza del romanzo rendendolo un po\u2019 artificioso e prolisso. Un vero peccato.Come ho gi\u00e0 detto la trama di per s\u00e9 non \u00e8 niente di eclatante ma nonostante ci\u00f2 godibile e intrigante che lascia, alla fine, un senso di torbido e inconcluso perch\u00e9, come ogni volta \nqualcosa in Rosemary ricorda e non vuole dimenticare."}, {"userName": "Filipe Miguel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5855795-filipe-miguel", "userReview": "Publicado em 1989, Maligna, Evil Seed no original, foi o primeiro romance oficialmente lan\u00e7ado por Joanne Harris. \u00c0 data com 25 anos, Harris apresentou um romance pseudo-g\u00f3tico com cen\u00e1rio a condizer, passado em Cambridge, Inglaterra, cheio de oportunidade, mas ainda com poucos dos tra\u00e7os que actualmente se lhe atribuem.Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, United KingdomCambridge, local de passagem por excel\u00eancia, devido \u00e0 orla estudantil, com vida nocturna, cultura e arquitectura perfeitas, \u00e9 o cen\u00e1rio ideal para Harris exp\u00f4r o sobrenatural e todo o gore da sua imagina\u00e7\u00e3o.Podemos facilmente considerar que o livro tenha duas partes, se bem que o intervalo entre ambas n\u00e3o se apresente marcadamente definido.

In conclusione: un'idea splendida, un libro abbastanza maturo nonostante sia stato il suo esordio: si trovano tutti gli elementi che verranno poi sviluppati successivamente dalla Harris quali alcune ambientazioni cimiteriali (Grantchester, Highgate, Montmartre), le fiere di paese, i luna park, gli zingari, il destino come una ruota che gira ed il libro intero \u00e8 una base per il testo che uscir\u00e0 poi nel 1993 tradotto in Italia con il titolo Il fante di cuore e la dama di picche, uno studio sicuramente molto appassionato dell'arte preraffaelita, e un dialogo, ancora una volta, con il male, con i finali non lieti, con sentieri oscuri impercorribili a cui la Harris accenna, ma di cui mai non parla."}, {"userName": "Elke", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1105232-elke", "userReview": "I am so glad I finally finished this book after it dragged on endlessly, making me skip across the pages and for the first time testing my learned fast reading skills on a work of fiction...While I may have loved the gothic aura and slow creeping suspense of the story several years ago, today I just found it mostly boring. Sure, the author knows how to weave a tale, with captivating, though not necessarily likable, characters and a clever plot. However, the voice of the book did not call out to me as it would have in earlier times. Maybe I'm just feeling anxious about wasting my time with unnecessary decorum, maybe it was just the wrong time to pick up this title, but what choice did I have!?

Clumsy story, changing from one narrator to the other (yes there's two of them), it comes to a point that you really have to be very focused on the story to know who's who.

The setting for this novel is Cambridge which sprang to life and reminded me what a truly beautiful city it is. This book contains two intersecting stories - one set in the late forties and one set today. The central characters are Rosemary/Ginny with their strange companions Elaine, Rafe, Java and Zach and their victims in one way or another Danny, Joe, Alice and Inspector Turner. It's an intriguing supernatural story of vampire like creatures - ' We're the masters Danny ... The chosen ones. The lords of Creation. The predators'. They feed on people literally and metaphorically, taking their loves and lives making some into their victims and turning others into monsters like Danny. As others have commented the ending is strange and oddly unsatisfactory! Daniel, Alice and Inspector Turner tried to destroy them and it seems they did so is it memory that recalls them?
