She quickly finds out that not only does she have a chance of creating a wonderful restaurant for people to dine at, but she also has become the talk of the town with the single men that are overflowing the town. With every single man in town trying to win her affections, she has a hard time trying to get her business up and running. When Gwen hires single man Daniel Creighton, the attraction that builds between the two is inevitable. Daniel though does not want to start a relationship. He has a job to do and that is what he plans on doing. This was basically a predictable romance that you know with every page how it is going to turn out. The author also likes to weave other stories into the book to set it up for more books in the series. This made it hard to fully enjoy the romance of Gwen and Daniel. Once you start getting towards the last half of the book though, you realize that all the stories she has weaved together also fit together as one. I enjoyed the book, I just wished we could have had more romance between Gwen and Daniel instead of the rush to get them together as a couple. Predictability and rushed plot made this book not as appealing as it should have been. I still want to read the next book in the series though just so I can see how the author plans to expand the stories of the other side characters. A good book for a rainy day to keep your craving for sweet romances going, but not one you should expect any surprise endings for."}, {"userName": "Margaret Hardie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22769819-margaret-hardie", "userReview": "Light read - happy ending, comedy romance. This works for listening while commuting in my car since heavy, intellectual could be distracting, right? But don't expect any kind of enlightenment.

The book is about the town, not just the couple. This is the first in her Misty Harbor series, so we are introduced to a number of the people in town. This is a sweet and cute book. Nothing too deep, but romantic. Daniel and Gwen are a cute couple that are perfect for each other, even if they avoid it for half of the book. Most of the book is about them avoiding their feelings and not wanting a relationship. Gwen is focused on getting her restaurant running and doesn't have time for a man, even though every eligible bachelor in town is stopping by with a gift (everything from dead fish to chocolates). Daniel just isn't ready for rejection and he watches her reject man after man and doesn't want to make a fool of himself. Yes, this book is a little corny, but I like a corny ready now and then. Perfect for when I am looking for something easy and sweet.This book is followed by Christmas on Conrad Street about Gwen's sister, Sydney."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3919132-linda", "userReview": "Gwen Fletcher is a middle child from a family of overachievers. She's also a 26-year-old chef that is opening her own restaurant in Misty Harbor- a town she just moved to. She's hired Daniel Creighton to fix up the building. Daniel is not just a 29-year-old carpenter/fixer-upper but a craftsman. He works wonders with wood.Because of a misunderstanding from years before, Daniel is leary of relationships but is still attracted to Gwen from the start. Her cooking is just the beginning.Gwen realizes that there is something special about him and wants more but neither knows how to communicate their tension and desire to each other. I liked the fact that they didn't just jump into bed. Their feelings grew. There are also lots of interesting side characters that I would love to see developed in other books.Why not 5 stars? Something about the last 25 pages fell short of explanations. Still, it was an enjoyable read if you are looking for a nice contemporary romance."}, {"userName": "Tawnya", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12710931-tawnya", "userReview": "(This is more about why I chose the book than what it is about)My maiden name is Evanick. You know how sometimes you get curious and just put your name into a Google search to see who else in the world has your name. Well, what I found out is that there is an author with my last name--Marcia Evanick--which is by no means common. At least it is not here...I went to the local library to see if they have any copies of any of Ms. Evanick's books....Just so happens they have Catch of the Day on the shelf. I took it home and devoured it. It took me about three hours to read all in all. I'd read more fiction written by her.I read a lot of romance novels and I was very happy to find someone I have a connection with (no matter how microscopic)who can write!

An upscale restaurant is needed in Misty Harbor as much as single women are needed.

He is one fine man with skilled hands and a past that he is not willing to share with Gwen. Maggie is the disgrace of town after breaking Daniel's heart 5 years ago, but now she is back in town.

Granted, it was a Christmas gift from my mom, from probably about 10 years ago. If I'd read it then, I may have thought more of it at the time than I do today. But it was a sweet & cute book - made me chuckle a few times...& it definitely had you involved with the opening of a business (main character opens up her dream restaurant in Maine, called 'Catch of the Day')...but it left much to be desired in depth & story arc. What the author took 19 chapters to accomplish, I feel that others may have been able to cover in half that while involving the reader more. But then maybe I spend too much time reading in-depth fantasy novels. ;)"}, {"userName": "Diane ~Firefly~", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3264885-diane-firefly", "userReview": "Misty Harbor is an interesting small town in Maine with a surplus of men. Gwen moves here to open her dream restaurant.What I enjoyed:* The small town feel. It was realistic as not everything was perfect.* Tons of supporting characters that will most likely be getting their own stories* Multiple story lines. Gwen and David were the main, but Hunter rejoining life was a great background story.What could have been better:* Not sure why Gwen had such an inferiority complex as her family seems amazing"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/254596-mary", "userReview": "I really liked this contemporary romance. It's the first in a series so I hope to find the rest. I used an Audible credit for the audiobook. Great narrator. There's one spicy hot scene (which honestly, I didn't need to hear, lol) so be forewarned. Otherwise, Marcia Evanick's small Maine coastal town characters were lovable and funny. What's not to like when food and the Maine coast are combined in a novel? I think the author did a fantastic job on laying the groundwork for a new series (back in 2002). Recommended to fans of contemporary romance (and small Maine towns!)."}, {"userName": "Evelyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/628974-evelyn", "userReview": "When Gwen moves to the small town of Misty Harbor, Maine to open a restaurant, she isn't prepared for her status as the town's only bachelorette.

I thought it was one of Janet Evanovich's contemporary romance books, and I didn't even really look at it until I was home from the library. Since I had it I just decided to read it anyway and I really liked it! It was a really cute story and it was funny.
