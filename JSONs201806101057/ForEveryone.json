This is a poem/letter for \"dreamers\" in the world. It's as much of testament of Reynolds' trials and errors as much as it is a call-to-action for the readers. The writing style is very clean and this probably only took me 10 minutes to read because it's barely over 100 pages and it's designed in a neat format on the page that plays around with font and spacing. The only disconnect I had from this is that it's pretty surface-level. I'm sure to teens this book will be empowering, but I've read books and seen TEDTalks that are much more in depth than this. I give this book a lot of credit because I know Reynolds' story and I respect him so much as a person and what he's been through and what his writing stands for, and I know that his fans will find some great inspiration in this book, but it just wasn't groundbreaking to me."}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "Originally performed at the Kennedy Center for the unveiling of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, and later as a tribute to Walter Dean Myers, this short speech by great performer and children\u2019s author Reynolds is vaguely titled, but it is addressed to young people about the importance of dreams. In it the now successful Reynolds reveals how he was unsuccessful most of his life, and never gave up. His principal accomplishment seems to be the fact that he is an inspiration to thousands of kids. He seems to be one who has taken up the torch held by Walter Dean Myers.I was looking for a video version, haven\u2019t found it yet, but did find this similarly themed one: Letter to a Dreamer:https://vimeo.com/75461662Here is Reynolds on poetry:https://www.poetryfoundation.org/vide..."}, {"userName": "\u2747Critterbee ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42804965-critterbee", "userReview": "Beautiful.

By the second \u201cchapter,\u201d I was crying uncontrollably because these words hit me so close to home. For Every One is a love letter to dreamers of all ages, the kind of book you hold tight and return to when things look bleak. The overriding theme is: keep going. keep going. keep going.

I listened to the audiobook, which is read by Jason himself, and I highly recommend it. It\u2019s only about 30 minutes long so it\u2019s a quick read or listen \u2013 but so powerful, you\u2019ll immediately want to read it again. (Which, yes, I did hit \u201creplay\u201d after I finished it once.)Jason speaks so honestly in For Every One; \u201cI have yet to see my own dream made tangible.\u201d He speaks to the dreamers and to not give up. But it\u2019s more than that. Everyone sets these preplanned goals for themselves such as, \u201cBy this age, I will have accomplished this much\u201d and when you don\u2019t accomplish that, you feel like a failure. Jason let\u2019s us know that isn\u2019t the case. You can\u2019t compare yourself to somebody else\u2019s goals or accomplishments. You can only compare yourself to you. There is no right or wrong way, no age limit, nothing stopping you from achieving your dream but your own self doubt. This piece is so inspirational I\u2019m tempted to quote every other line \u2013 but that would defeat the purpose of you experiencing this for yourself.The language he uses is so raw and real. He uses colloquial speech \u2013 he isn\u2019t using big fancy words. He\u2019s using words we all hear in speak in our everyday life, if you\u2019re rich or poor, black or white or somewhere in between \u2013 everyone can understand his words. That\u2019s one of the things I love about Jason\u2019s writing \u2013 it\u2019s easy to understand, but the way he weaves the words together and makes metaphors \u2013 wow. It hits you. You never realized how powerful words could be.This is the third piece I\u2019m reading that Jason Reynolds has written and I will officially read anything and everything this man writes from now until forever. I am in love with his writing and if you have never read anything by Jason Reynolds, please do yourself a favor and pick something up \u2013 I\u2019ve read For Every One, Long Way Down, and All American Boys \u2013 highly recommend ALL of those!If you\u2019re feeling like you will never accomplish your dreams \u2013 give this a read or listen. Listen to Jason\u2019s words. They will give you hope you didn\u2019t know you had.\u201cDreams don\u2019t have timelines, deadlines, and aren\u2019t always in straight lines. Jump anyway.\u201dThe audiobook has an extended excerpt of Jason speaking about writing this and how it was almost a bow out to himself \u2013 saying, you tried, but you failed. \n\u201cFreedom has less to do with making dreams come true. Freedom has everything to do with having the courage to have a dream.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Jerrie (redwritinghood)", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1072080-jerrie-redwritinghood", "userReview": "I enjoyed this very short book.

So, when I saw that he published another Young Adult Novel, I could not wait to get my hands on it. This was written similarly and it was an inspirational read. It was only a hundred pages so it was a quick read. Perfect for teenagers who don't want to commit their time to reading. This was such a great book to read for anyone who is feeling lost and needs some direction in life. There were so many quotable prose in this book, I could take up this whole page. It is a great thought that not everyone has their life together including this author Jason Reynolds.

For every one person. For every one dream. But especially for every one kid. The kids who dream of being better than they are. Kids who dream of doing more than they almost dare to dream. Kids who are like Jason Reynolds, a self-professed dreamer. Jason does not claim to know how to make dreams come true; he has, in fact, been fighting on the front line of his own battle to make his own dreams a reality. He expected to make it when he was sixteen. Then eighteen. Then twenty-five. Now, some of those expectations have been realized. But others, the most important ones, lay ahead, and a lot of them involve kids, how to inspire them. All the kids who are scared to dream, or don\u2019t know how to dream, or don\u2019t dare to dream because they\u2019ve NEVER seen a dream come true. Jason wants kids to know that dreams take time. They involve countless struggles. But no matter how many times a dreamer gets beat down, the drive and the passion and the hope never fully extinguish\u2014because just having the dream is the start you need, or you won\u2019t get anywhere anyway, and that is when you have to take a leap of faith.A pitch perfect graduation, baby, or love my kid gift.", "title": "For Everyone", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35297455-for-everyone", "average": 4.41, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1511089184l/35297455.jpg", "reviews": 408, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1229281.Jason_Reynolds", "name": "Jason Reynolds"}], "type": ["Poetry", "Young Adult", "Young Adult"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35297455-for-everyone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35398419-for-everyone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36578750-for-every-one", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36101176-for-every-one", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25657130-all-american-boys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22552026-long-way-down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28954126-ghost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21490991-the-boy-in-the-black-suit", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17428880-when-i-was-the-greatest"]}
