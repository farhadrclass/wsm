An earlier occupant of my office had left it on the shelf and I eyed it with contempt for years before curiosity finally drove me to flip through the pages. And wham! I suddenly realized all the hype around Stephen Covey wasn't just hype. He is one of those rare people -- I have known two or three in my life -- with the facility of clear thinking, who intuitively understand cause and effect, and therefore act in such a way as to produce the desired outcome. Why can't the rest of humankind do this? I really don't know. Once we have it pointed out to us, we see it; but there is a kind of fog around our brains that prevents us seeing it on our own. Why else are there so many frustrated people, so many unhappy families? it's not because we want to hurt ourselves and those around us, it's because we don't understand how to 'begin with the end in mind', to think clearly about where we want to go and chalk out our flight plan to get there. If you're a confused mortal wondering why nothing works out the way you want it to, read this book! If you can practise the techniques it describes, good for you! And even if you can't do it all the time, you'll still gain a better understanding of yourself and your problems. You may skip a lot of the stories, examples and re-caps, as I did. but you'll still get enough out of the book to make you glad you read it."}, {"userName": "Mommywest", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1565000-mommywest", "userReview": "Written using the same principles that were introduced in the bestselling \"The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,\" Stephen Covey applies The Seven Habits to the family using personal, family, and others' experiences to illustrate each concept. Every chapter includes ways to apply the principles in the family, and ways to teach the principles to your family. I've only read a chapter or two of the first Seven Habits book, and so I enjoyed not only learning about the Seven Habits, but how they apply to the family. Like any program, the Seven Habits takes time and application, and then patience to see results, but the Seven Habits are grounded in truths that will help anyone or any family have better relationships and be more successful in life. I loved the illustrating stories and the personal insights that Dr. Covey, his wife, his family, and others shared to help the reader learn how to apply the principles. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants ideas on how to improve family relationships and create a beautiful family culture.When we lived in student housing at BYU, our stake president (the leader of several LDS congregations) was John Covey, Dr. Covey's brother. We had the privilege of having a half-day seminar given by John and Stephen Covey based on these principles, with break-out sessions given by his wife and daughters and one of the counselors who also worked for Covey. There was no promotion of the company whatsoever; just an excellent discussion of how to build our little budding families in positive, inspired ways. I've always appreciated the time they took out of their busy lives to teach us the doctrines of Jesus Christ and the practical application of them using the experiences they've had in applying the Seven Habits and other truths."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1265674-heather", "userReview": "I really liked 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, and in the context of families it makes even more sense. 7 Habits:1: Use your agency/be proactive.

His books \u2013 to me \u2013 read a bit too much like tracts. And the sappy stories and drawings kind of freak me out. I have an overall sense that he is restraining his desire to preach, to lead me to salvation, to shout \u2018AMEN!\u2019 But I won\u2019t for one single second deny that he has an unusual insight and wisdom pertaining to success and purpose. So I read The Seven Habits for Families. There is a lot in here. So much so that I think this is almost better used as a reference book \u2013 something to page through every now and then to mull over for a few days. From my vantage the real value of the book comes in the first few chapters when Covey explores the stimulus-pause-response cycle. Something happens \u2013 a child breaks a vase or a dad gets a bonus and we have an inclination to act. Act now. To be in the moment, so to speak. Covey takes some pages to show that this space between action and response is where we are able to direct our futures. Our decisions about how to respond set up our future circumstances. It\u2019s a cycle that we can use to point our lives in a direction of our choosing. Through the rest of the book he focuses on the Seven Habits with applications for families: priorities, relationships, family and personal growth. He spends a good amount of time on the family business plan: putting together a real document that outlines a family\u2019s core principles, priorities, and goals. Take this with a grain of salt and adjust it to your family situation. Other reviewers point out that a family is not a business or a sports team. True enough. But the truism sums it up: it\u2019s easy to get there when you don\u2019t know where you are going. The family plan is an opportunity to talk about what is important and to set common goals. Nothing has to be written in stone. Real business plans certainly aren\u2019t. They set goals and develop plans for how to reach them and then, at regular intervals, assess how they are doing and make requisite changes. I was impressed that Covey stresses that this is not something that is to be churned out in a weekend by dad \u2013 it\u2019s not a rule book. He cautions that everyone in the family must be able to take the time they need to think hard about how they and their desires fit into the family. It\u2019s clear to me that the plan is well in play when you simply start thinking about it. The book settles nicely into Covey\u2019s folksy, ah shucks writing style. It\u2019s easy to read and easy to digest. Some will call it wishful thinking \u2013 this is the new millennium after all. Families look different, entertainment looks different, you can have an electronic pet if you prefer. But I think Covey would say that we still want the same thing: parents want their children to grow up to be kind and respectful. We want to enjoy meaningful time with our family and friends. Children want to be understood and listened to. Though the times change human nature remains the same. People come to these kinds of books with different expectations. For some the book will provide a few useful tips for navigating your family toward a known goal. Others will find it a godsend of wisdom. I find it hard to imagine a family that couldn\u2019t benefit from a reading of the Habits for Families."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1023683-erin", "userReview": "I read this as an audiobook which turned out to be a mistake. It's just too hard to absorb the ideas when you are driving, and I wanted to make notes and had to settle for voice memos. When I do a reread, as I should, I will read the paper or e-version.That said, it was a sound book with a lot of good suggestions. We are actively working on our family dynamics so that we can bring our a-game in anticipation of another child, and this book gave my husband and I a lot of good talking points. I think that's the key to any self-help book like this: you're not going to change just from reading them, but you'll walk away with ideas and things to discuss with your partner, and that's where the change slowly seeps in. See, even \"change\" is too strong a word because it implies a problem, and you don't need to have a problem to get something from this book. It's more like adding a weight-lifting program to your fitness regime so that you can tone existing muscles. This helps you tone your family structure.The 7 habits for my own reference are:1. Be proactive: rather than reactive2. Establish a written family or personal mission statement: Ok yes, this sounds cheesetastic, and no, we haven't done it yet, BUT it is an interesting discussion to talk about what you each think your family's core mission is. Why are you a family unit? What are you hoping to achieve? 3. Put first things firstYour family is first and should be a top priority. Really, actually schedule it on the calendar and treat it like a business meeting. The time is filled, you can't schedule anything else there. This is such a great suggestion, and one we've already put into practice. I had to turn down a fun invitation this Friday because I'd already committed to a storytime with my son. It was on the calendar, so I had that time blocked out for him, and I knew it was a priority for us.4. Think \"win-win\"Boy, isn't this life with a toddler? Every day we try to give him choices (so he feels independent) that we can live with (so we get what we need too). It seems that this extends into older children and family life.5. Seek first to understand, then to be understoodI loved this one. One thing Covey said that I had to record was that when you love someone, you must love the things they love as much as you love the person themself to truly accept that person. 6. \"Synergize\"Find a way to foster family unity through differences, not in spite of.7. \"Sharpen the saw\"Continually work on these 7 things (Covey offers the analogy of a person sawing for two hours to chop down a tree when someone asks if they have tried sharpening the saw. \"are you crazy? I can't stop for that!\")"}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34270033-katie", "userReview": "Getting through this book was very difficult for me. Not because the content was bad, just because it was very...dense. (Also because I'm bad at reading.) If I was reading very meticulously as I am wont to do, I could only manage a couple pages before my brain was saturated. I think, honestly, it could've done with quite a few less stories and examples, and there were definitely times I felt like though something was quite interesting, it wasn't really necessary. You can tell the guy is very well-learned and...maybe wants to show it. Nevertheless it was all quite fascinating.The content was really quite good in my opinion, though I'm not quite sure how to describe it. It isn't exactly a 7 step system as one would assume, as those are pretty straightforward. It's more like... 7 methodologies for living? Almost like, psychological principles.It is definitely very wholesome which I appreciate. He covers the importance of spiritual, social-emotional, physical/economic, and mental aspects of life and their importance. He covers modeling and mentoring. Empathetic LISTENING. Creating a win-win situation instead of the win-lose our culture seems to follow. Making the important (not urgent) a priority in our life.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that is a part of a family, wants to have a family, or interacts with people. So basically, everyone. My only hesitation is just the length and density. I know there are abridged versions and cliff notes, those might be able to capture the essential methodologies so if you can't make it through the book, try those. Definitely worth having in your tool bag.(P.S. I like how for our premarital counseling we were required to read several books that were no where near the quality of this. UGH GET IT TOGETHER, PEOPLE. I would HIGHLY recommend this for anyone getting married or especially recently married.

I have never read the first book by Stephen Covey, but must say that I quite enjoyed this book and the habits that are presented here for making your family the most important in your life and the most successfully you can. I really like how this book starts out by talking about how we are off course 90% of the time in the family, and we must constantly work to get things back on track. This is a great reference book and one that I want to get my hands on so that I can write in it, highlight it, and make notes.

There is some good stuff here about adapting the habits to family life, but the book has three large flaws. First, it's repetitive. The sections could each be about 1/3 to 1/2 the length but he repeats himself over and over. I understand the thing about people needing to hear things seven times to get it but this doesn't work well in a book. Second, Covey has very clear biases in favor of the traditional model where the wife stays home and the husband works (and of course same-sex couples don't exist in this world). He refers to single parents but this is apparently the only time it's acceptable for women to work. He's pretty explicit about this belief, going off on a lengthy tangent a little over halfway through and citing research but conveniently leaving out the research that doesn't support his bias. In a world where most mothers work, he gives no attention to how that changed a family. Then there was this: There are real life stories throughout and in one of them a woman tells a bizarre story from her teenaged years about a movie night at home with her mom, who was pregnant. The mom had a miscarriage while they were home alone but she subverted her feelings when her daughter found her in the bathroom. They cleaned up and went on as normal. The adult daughter reflecting back said \"instead of wallowing in her grief...she cared more about my feelings than her own and turned what could have been a traumatic experience for me into a positive one.\" A POSITIVE experience? I found this disturbing. The mother didn't seek medical care or even have a chance to process the feelings and this is seen as a good thing? This is an example of how NOT to handle a miscarriage in my opinion. I didn't actually finish the book because this stopped me in my tracks."}, {"userName": "Michaela", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/156551-michaela", "userReview": "I'm very impressed with this book and anticipate that it will have a positive impact on the culture of my young family. I purchased the book after having a discussion with my husband about family mission statements. Our son was a year old at the time, and we felt compelled to approach our young family with deliberateness and intentionality. Every other endeavor in our lives had come after research, or it came with instructions. We feared that if we just free-styled family life then in thirty years we'd be left with regret and wondering how the hell we got there. Perhaps we'd also have a few good reports that things had \"turned out\" okay, but accidental results aren't always good. This book has excellent principles which when put to use will empower a family to operate as a body (where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, kind of thing), and have the strength to weather all the unexpected problems it will no doubt face. I've underlined a lot on the pages, and am excited for my husband to read it, too. Mostly I'm excited for when we sit down and write our Family Mission Statement which will determine the culture in which our children live. My only complaint is that this book isn't good \"literature\". It's very, very long winded. Each chapter is enormous. The author has so many ways of restating a single point, that the chapters feel repetitive, too. But think of his book as more of a reference and you'll do fine. I intend to return to it over the years as challenges arise.

These techniques Covey suggests, trains the brain to activate emotions of empathy, honor, sincerity, significance, straightforwardness that is rooting in the heart of us to release; awareness, ease and flow of reasonable understanding, compassion and love towards our loved ones. A task that takes little effort, and plenty rewards.I recommend this book for prospective parents, parents, guardians, caretakers of children, or anyone who cares enough about our young people who may struggle with peer pressure, abuse, self identify, drugs, alcohol, unruly behavior, rebelliousness, and other obstacles that can obstruct them from becoming productive members of self first. This book inspired me to create this quote: \u201cUntil we examine all opportunities for examination: talks, support groups, readings, understanding, practices and positive people with inspiration of contributions and the production of loving and healthy relationships, then we can rest to sure that we openly and gracefully changed our circumstances for the betterment with our own hands.\u201d Peace and Blessings, Malikah"}, {"userName": "Brian Bojo", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5968518-brian-bojo", "userReview": "This book took me a while to read because I took extensive notes, which I do not normally do.

To summarize, the 7 habits are as follows: (1) Be proactive rather than reactive; (2) Establish a written family mission statement and written family values; (3) Make family your top priority; (4) Try to create \"win-win\" scenarios; (5) Seek first to understand, then to be understood; (6) \"Synergize\", or put all of these together; and (7) \"Sharpen the saw\", or continually renew yourself and your family physically, mentally, socially, and emotionally.

That said, it is a good book with many useful family specific stories and the information truly is powerful and potentiall life changing personally and for a family.
