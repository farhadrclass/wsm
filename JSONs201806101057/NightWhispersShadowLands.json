I was so absorbed and at the edge of my seat with all the fast paced exciting action. The bond between hero and heroine was so strong and what he does for her was awesome.

I know you better than anyone. Maybe even you.\u201dBefore I start, let me just say \u2013 don\u2019t let the cover fool you. Yes this book has a very kick ass heroine who faces down baddies, but this book has a very sweet, adorable tone to it. I don\u2019t feel like the cover portrays that well. Anyway! I usually shy away from books with zombies, or Shadows as they are called in this book. It\u2019s sometimes hard to reconcile \u2018romance\u2019 with \u2018end of the world blood sucking creatures.\u2019 But, when the author offered this for review and used the keywords beta-hermit-hero, I couldn\u2019t resist. I love me a good beta hero, and I absolutely adored James in this book. After an illness spreads across the world, creating zombie like shadow creatures that come out and hunt at night, biting to spread the disease, the United States (or what is left of it) goes into hiding. Half stay in the west, retreating into Cheyenne, the other half stay out east going underground into a place called Raven Rock. Communication was open between these two stations until a huge explosion occurred at Raven Rock. In this explosion, James was injured and now carries the scars. Pre-illness, he was an analyst so he is very tech savvy. He rigs a communication network up, that allows him to speak (two-way) with his agents that are spread out around the country. While James is great at working with his agents, he hasn\u2019t left Rock Raven for two years. The idea of going out into the world terrifies him. These agents help find humans and bring them to safety. Enter our heroine.Jules is a former gang member and drug abuser. When the illness occurred, she left her holed up home to find another high. Instead she almost gets attacked by the Shadows. A stranger by the name Erik finds her and together they learn how to survive. However, after the west loses contact with the east, Erik disappears and Jules feels loyalty to help find him. She gets a clue that he may be at Cheyenne station, and takes off. James is worried that she is out alone, but being across the country the only thing he can do is talk in her ear and try to keep a signal of where she is. Over the past year, they have become very good friends and even flirt, although Jules has no idea what James looks like he only has seen her if she happens to walk in front of a mirror or a reflection (due to a collar Jules wears that has a video camera on it). Just as James was concerned, Jules does run into danger, and when communication is cut off with her, he must decide if he is strong enough to leave his underground haven and go rescue her. Night Whispers had everything I want in a book \u2013 a really strong heroine, a shyer bashful hero, and a great storyline with plenty of action to keep the book moving along. It took me a bit to comprehend the world and what exactly was happening and who was where and the why of it all. But as I got further into the story it all fell into place.Jules and James have this unique relationship where they are intimately connected, as Jules wears this collar that allows communication between the two of them, and James is able to turn on a video that allows him to see her surroundings. But they have never physically met and for the most part, don\u2019t know what the other looks like. But they cautiously flirt and they would do anything for the other one. Jules describes James as - \u201cHe was a thinker, her guy.\u201d Always analyzing situations thoroughly before suggesting action. He is warm, smart, and a calm voice in Jules\u2019s ear. While the world is dark and dangerous, their romance and relationship is very light and surprising. As a gift, Jules decides to show James a real, printed book (as they are rare in the world they live in). So as she is across the country with just her video monitor on, she breaks into an old university library, and shows him a real book. \u201cTouch them for me.\u201d James\u2019s whisper started a tingle in her abdomen that was as worrisome as heart flutters.She wore combat boots and carried a big knife, for fuck\u2019s sake. She had no time for flutters and tingles. You should remember that before giving sappy presents. She propped her blade against the bookshelf and wiped her hands on her pants before running her finger along the spines of the closest leather-bound volumes. They appeared elegant with gold embossed writing. In contrast, her hand looked stubby and mannish with its bitten-off nails and scars.\u201cPick one up. Please.\u201dShe licked her suddenly dry lips and pulled a book off the shelf. His breathing stuttered before accelerating. It took a rare man to have an orgasm over books.Are you seeing why I love James? They are an unlikely pair, wild, former druggie Jules who runs head-first into danger and has no problems killing shadows and living on the edge. And James who is hidden underground, fearful, not self confident. But he really does love her and his character is put to the test when she gets in danger. You can\u2019t help but root for them and their happy ever after, which ended up working well for me.Even if dystopian worlds make you hesitate, I encourage you to try this one. The Shadows, while a threat, do not take center stage in this book. As I said earlier, it took me awhile to comprehend this world, but stick with it. The romance is a sweet one you don\u2019t want to miss.Rating: B"}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7451210-amanda", "userReview": "The cover really doesn't represent the story and that's totally not how James should looks like. James can be describe as geeky, genius, sweet, funny and sometimes insecure. The hero in the cover look totally alpha and badass to me. Alisha Rai gives us a really sweet beta hero, who doesn't kick ass and hide himself in a military bunker for years. This is quite refreshing story and seems real because when he came across the Shadow aka Zombie, he might scream and yelp, but who doesn't. But when he's girl is in danger he will risk everything to save her. How sweet is that.I was quite surprise that the story started out with James and Jules had already been communicating with each other for a year. So they pretty much had an mutual attraction despite haven't seen each other yet. When Jules keep insisting that her mission was to look for Erik, a guy who used to save her, I thought 'No!', I hate love triangle. Luckily, that's not the case. This book had one of the funniest love scene that I came across. And it also sounds real, they don't actually do it on the floor, or kitchen top or against the wall (who actually does that btw).For those who want to read on a beta hero for a change, do pick this up. I imagine the sequel might be on Erik, who is Jules's mentor."}, {"userName": "Rana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11102791-rana", "userReview": "I don't know what's worse, that I read a sexy book about vampires or that I wanted more about the vampires."}, {"userName": "E_bookpushers", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7274938-e-bookpushers", "userReview": "OK I no longer like playing with Shadows...Can't wait for the next one!The world-building was very interesting and intricate. I did have a few questions about how Jules and James initially started their working relationship but I really enjoyed how things unfurled. The combination of danger, personal secrets, crazed scientists, and mutual attraction was great to see. Rai did a good job of building up the suspense and increasing my doubt that things were going to turn out ok at least for the moment. Ended up reviewing this on the blog with MinnChica: http://thebookpushers.com/2012/11/06/...Publisher: SamhainPublish Date: Out NowHow I got this book: Review copy from authorAnalyst James Bennett has spent the years since humankind fell victim to the Illness living underground. Part of an elite group of survivors determined to save their race, his only interaction with the blood-drinking Shadows roaming the Earth is through surveillance technology carried by his team of search-and-rescue agents. Scarred by vicious events, he has no desire to leave the safety of his bunker for the dangerous world outside\u2014until he recruits a tough, haunted young woman clear across the country.Former gang member Jules Guerrero learned two things early on: the value of loyalty and never backing down from a fight. Both of those teachings come in handy now that her job description includes protecting humans and kicking Shadow ass. But it\u2019s hard to keep her mind strictly on her mission when all she can think about is the man whose voice keeps her sane through the depths of each dark night.When Jules is captured and threatened by a rogue organization even more bloodthirsty than the Shadows, James must draw on all of his courage to fuel a furious cross-country chase through the lawless land\u2026before the Jules he loves is destroyed forever.Product WarningsContains a hero who would fight monsters for his love, a heroine out to save the world, a treacherous wasteland, poetry as foreplay and flesh-eating enemies.*Blurb from Goodreads*MinnChica: One of my favorite genres that I have a hard time finding books in is post-apocalyptic romance, so when I put out a call for suggestions and recommendations earlier in the year, I was sooo glad to hear Rai was in the process of writing this, and couldn\u2019t wait to read it. I love Rai\u2019s writing, she does such an amazing job of building unique worlds and keeping up with the sexy times. I loved everything about the ShadowLands world, and am so excited to see where else this series takes us!E: I have to say from when Rai first mentioned this during MinnChica\u2019s call for suggestions until last week when I was able to read it I have been looking forward to Night Whispers. The wait was worth it and now I am waiting for the next installment. Her world, the details included in it, the Shadows and not to mention mad scientists made for a very captivating read. There is so much left for us to discover and I am looking forward to the journey, from my nice, safe, sturdy, secure well-lit house.MinnChica: I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the romance plot, especially since our hero and heroine spent the first half of the book (or so) separated from each other. Hell, they hadn\u2019t even MET each other. It\u2019s hard to really get invested in a romance when the two main characters are so divided and apart, and yet Jules and James were able to make it work, they were able to still form a stable bond, and pull me into their romance from their first conversation on the page. It wasn\u2019t something I was expecting, but was so glad it worked out that way!E: That was really amazing. But if you think about it with on-line dating today and the internet people do develop relationships before they physically meet each other. I have always had a hard time buying that in books or movies I think because it didn\u2019t seem plausible given the rest of today\u2019s technology but how Rai set it up was just wonderful. And then the lengths they would go through to make a day special for the other *melt*. Not to mention a hero who loves books There aren\u2019t enough of those in the romance world!MinnChica: Although James and Jules were the perfect hero and heroine for this story, I have to take a minute and point out all the fabulous secondary characters Rai brought into this world. I am so excited to see what happens with Erik, and how or if he will come to Raven and be a part of the fight. I loved Gabriel and his reluctance to be the figurehead of the new country. I hope everything with Carrie works out\u2026 God, just the secondary characters alone were enough to keep me flipping pages as fast as I could read.E: Oh wow those secondary characters were amazing. They never stole the spotlight but I can\u2019t wait to find out what happens with them. They were so complete which is refreshing to see in the supporting cast. Each of them has had their lives turned upside and shaken in ways that most people would never recover from yet they are still living and fighting. I am not going to try to figure out who I want to pair up with whom I just hope they all have HEAs because a life that hard certainly needs one. Rai has opened up such a can of worms in my head over everything I want to know in her Shadowlands world.MinnChica: Back to Jules and James\u2026. There was so much I enjoyed about each of them. James was this shy and quiet hero who was so scared of the big-bad-world and yet he sucked up his fears and anxieties and went out in search of Jules when she needed him most. He was a beta hero to the core, and although I\u2019m usually not a huge fan of the beta hero, he wormed his way into my heart and had me falling in love. And Jules, poot Jules. With her screwed up childhood and desire to right every wrong she ever did, the poor girl was tortured. I loved that everyone teased her for having a hero complex, because she absolutely did, and it worked for her. I loved these two together, their personalities were night and day, and yet they complemented each other perfectly. I hope we see more of them as the series progresses.E: James was the best beta hero I have seen in quite a while. He cared about those he worked with and around but never wanted to take charge. But when Jules needed him he came through with flying colors. Courage isn\u2019t the absence of fear it is being scared and doing it anyways and James had it. He was the perfect counterbalance for Jules and her hero syndrome. She needed someone to take care of her and he needed someone who needed him for who and what he was with all of his scars exposed. Like MinnChica I hope we get to see glimpses into their relationship as the series continues because they were so wonderful together.MinnChica: All in all I am happy to add the ShadowLands series and Alisha Rai to my recommended reads in post-apocalyptic romance! Jules and James were so wonderful to read, the cast of secondary characters proves this series has so much more to live up to, and the world is engaging and exciting with all the twists and turns. I\u2019m so anxious to see where Rai leads us next, and hope she works on writing faster!I give Night Whispers a B+E: This has certainly landed on my re-read status. I do have a few questions about how Jules and James initially started in their roles but that certainly didn\u2019t interfere with my enjoyment of the story. Rai has set up a world and characters that I can see providing me with hours of entertainment as I explore it through her writing. Night Whispers hit all of my post-apocalyptic romance buttons without seeming like something I have already read. Again like MinnChica I think Rai needs to write faster!I give Night Whispers a B+"}, {"userName": "Las", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4373451-las", "userReview": "If James is a beta hero, then I need more beta heroes in my life. He goes out there, does what he has to do, kicks ass while doing it, but he actually feels normal human emotions while doing those things. He's scared shitless a lot of the time and feels completely out of his depth, but that doesn't stop him. What gets boring about the typical alpha romance hero is that--when it comes to dangerous situations--they're like superhuman machines. Sure, it's great that they win in the end, but I don't want them to be so confident that they're going to. It takes a lot more strength to fight when you're terrified and unsure of yourself.Jules is a great heroine, and while the \"alpha\" of the pair, she's still a person with her own insecurities (there's a point to be a made about the differences between alpha heroes and alpha heroines and why only one is allowed to be vulnerable...). I would have liked for them to have spent more time together face-to-face before the I-love-yous...while I got that they had established an emotional connection long before meeting each other, there's still something about physical presence that can't be replaced. And because I'm a geek about these things, I wanted more details about the zombie virus, the hybrid version, and the various ways they interact and get transmitted, because trying to figure out the particulars from what was written drove me nuts."}, {"userName": "Lillie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5864176-lillie", "userReview": "4.5 starsIt's been three years since The Illness became wide spread, turning every one infected into zombie-like creatures called Shadows. Jules Gerrero spends all her time searching for and rescuing survivors with only the voice of her handler, James Bennett, in her ear to keep away the loneliness. She never wants him know their light flirtation has become love for a man she's never seen. He's one of the elite chosen to go underground with key government officials to help rebuild their world. She doesn't think he could ever want her if he learned of her past filled with violence and drug abuse. She couldn't be more wrong.James hasn't been outside since an explosion destroyed part of the bunker and left him scarred. Jules's bravery amazes and humbles him. He teases her about her hero complex but that is one of the things he loves about her. When she vanishes and no soldiers are available to send after her, James faces all his fears to find the woman that means the world to him.I thoroughly this enjoyed one. It had an urban fantasy vibe with the world building but was still full of romance. I was holding my breath waiting for the first face to face meeting of Jules and James and it was every thing I hoped it would be. The banter between the two kept me engaged and once they were together, their love was so sweet and refreshing.I'm looking forward to seeing where Ms. Rai goes with this world. As soon as I finished reading NIGHT WHISPERS, I hit twitter to ask when the next one will be out and I was told it would probably be next year. Yay for more creepy Shadows, mad scientists, and heroes and heroines that kick butt!Favorite Quote:By the time she opened her eyes he\u2019d jerked the pants over his arousal.A flash of disappointment ran through her.

For me, Alisha Rai usually means a bit of smut with some interesting characters. But this one went beyond that and added in some fascinating world building too, and an action sequence (or two or three) as well! If anything, the smut was pretty limited, taking second place to the characters and story.Jules is the hardass fighter, accustomed to working alone and taking out the bad guys.James is the analyst who monitors her from afar, checking in with her over voice chat each night and helping her out when she needs it.And over the past few months, they've gradually fallen for each other. So when suddenly Jules misses her check-in and her vitals go offline, James is determined to reach her, even if it means reaching a long, long way out of his comfort zone.Everything about this worked well for me. It was fast-paced, the world was cool, the characters were built up over the course of the book. Perhaps the only thing that I felt was missing was seeing the development of Jules & James' relationship from the beginning, but I can see why that was left out and the book starts where it does.Also I should note that for some of this you'll need to put on your 'suspension of disbelief' hat - while Alisha Rai has generally done a good job writing post-apocalyptic world, there are definitely some inconsistent & unbelievable moments, like VR glasses that somehow hook into your nervous system and perfectly running water in abandoned houses. If these sorts of things really pull you out of a story then you might not enjoy it as much as I did.While this book works fine as a standalone, I hope Alisha Rai gets time to write the rest of the books in this series, because my curiosity about this world is certainly piqued."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3053000-nicole", "userReview": "Joint review originally posted here: http://thebookpushers.com/2012/11/06/...MinnChica: One of my favorite genres that I have a hard time finding books in is post-apocalyptic romance, so when I put out a call for suggestions and recommendations earlier in the year, I was sooo glad to hear Rai was in the process of writing this, and couldn\u2019t wait to read it. I love Rai\u2019s writing, she does such an amazing job of building unique worlds and keeping up with the sexy times. I loved everything about the ShadowLands world, and am so excited to see where else this series takes us!E: I have to say from when Rai first mentioned this during MinnChica\u2019s call for suggestions until last week when I was able to read it I have been looking forward to Night Whispers. The wait was worth it and now I am waiting for the next installment. Her world, the details included in it, the Shadows and not to mention mad scientists made for a very captivating read. There is so much left for us to discover and I am looking forward to the journey, from my nice, safe, sturdy, secure well-lit house.MinnChica: I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the romance plot, especially since our hero and heroine spent the first half of the book (or so) separated from each other. Hell, they hadn\u2019t even MET each other. It\u2019s hard to really get invested in a romance when the two main characters are so divided and apart, and yet Jules and James were able to make it work, they were able to still form a stable bond, and pull me into their romance from their first conversation on the page. It wasn\u2019t something I was expecting, but was so glad it worked out that way!E: That was really amazing. But if you think about it with on-line dating today and the internet people do develop relationships before they physically meet each other. I have always had a hard time buying that in books or movies I think because it didn\u2019t seem plausible given the rest of today\u2019s technology but how Rai set it up was just wonderful. And then the lengths they would go through to make a day special for the other *melt*. Not to mention a hero who loves books There aren\u2019t enough of those in the romance world!MinnChica: Although James and Jules were the perfect hero and heroine for this story, I have to take a minute and point out all the fabulous secondary characters Rai brought into this world. I am so excited to see what happens with Erik, and how or if he will come to Raven and be a part of the fight. I loved Gabriel and his reluctance to be the figurehead of the new country. I hope everything with Carrie works out\u2026 God, just the secondary characters alone were enough to keep me flipping pages as fast as I could read.E: Oh wow those secondary characters were amazing. They never stole the spotlight but I can\u2019t wait to find out what happens with them. They were so complete which is refreshing to see in the supporting cast. Each of them has had their lives turned upside and shaken in ways that most people would never recover from yet they are still living and fighting. I am not going to try to figure out who I want to pair up with whom I just hope they all have HEAs because a life that hard certainly needs one. Rai has opened up such a can of worms in my head over everything I want to know in her Shadowlands world.MinnChica: Back to Jules and James\u2026. There was so much I enjoyed about each of them. James was this shy and quiet hero who was so scared of the big-bad-world and yet he sucked up his fears and anxieties and went out in search of Jules when she needed him most. He was a beta hero to the core, and although I\u2019m usually not a huge fan of the beta hero, he wormed his way into my heart and had me falling in love. And Jules, poot Jules. With her screwed up childhood and desire to right every wrong she ever did, the poor girl was tortured. I loved that everyone teased her for having a hero complex, because she absolutely did, and it worked for her. I loved these two together, their personalities were night and day, and yet they complemented each other perfectly. I hope we see more of them as the series progresses.E: James was the best beta hero I have seen in quite a while. He cared about those he worked with and around but never wanted to take charge. But when Jules needed him he came through with flying colors. Courage isn\u2019t the absence of fear it is being scared and doing it anyways and James had it. He was the perfect counterbalance for Jules and her hero syndrome. She needed someone to take care of her and he needed someone who needed him for who and what he was with all of his scars exposed. Like MinnChica I hope we get to see glimpses into their relationship as the series continues because they were so wonderful together.MinnChica: All in all I am happy to add the ShadowLands series and Alisha Rai to my recommended reads in post-apocalyptic romance! Jules and James were so wonderful to read, the cast of secondary characters proves this series has so much more to live up to, and the world is engaging and exciting with all the twists and turns. I\u2019m so anxious to see where Rai leads us next, and hope she works on writing faster!I give Night Whispers a B+E: This has certainly landed on my re-read status. I do have a few questions about how Jules and James initially started in their roles but that certainly didn\u2019t interfere with my enjoyment of the story. Rai has set up a world and characters that I can see providing me with hours of entertainment as I explore it through her writing. Night Whispers hit all of my post-apocalyptic romance buttons without seeming like something I have already read. Again like MinnChica I think Rai needs to write faster!I give Night Whispers a B+"}, {"userName": "October", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28966646-october", "userReview": "Fast paced dystopian romance with a kick ass heroine and a swoon-worthy hero.

The characters were unique and relatable and the story wasn't based on ridiculous clich\u00e9s. I was instantly hooked and flew through the first half without pause and then pulled an all-nighter to finish it.Interesting take on a zombie/vampire-type virus outbreak. Not overly original, but handled in a way that was refreshing and held my interest. Basically, all the cool stuff you love about apocolypse settings without the annoying bullshit other authors try to pass off as entertainment.I'm glad the characters had flaws and weren't all special snowflakes. Also, soooo glad that someone finally wrote a book where the adults actually convey their damn thoughts and feelings instead of stringing the reader along for half a fucking book over some dumb shit with which normal people couldn't be bothered. Shit makes me want to do a violence... That's BAD! BAD WRITING! DON'T fucking do it, authors!The main guy was so lovable. He was so the type of love-interest I've been dying to read about. Just a normal fucking guy and not that over-the-top alpha crap that's been done to death. Seriously, him in the car when he hit the Shadow was cracking me up. He was portrayed how you would imagine a REAL person would react. Capable, but pants-pissing freaked out. It was fun seeing him overcome his issues. It was extra fucking MAGICAL that he wasn't a creepy privacy-invader, either! He had ample opportunity, but moralized it like a real human being should. THANK-FUCKING-JESUS!!! Such an unhealthy obsession, this romanticizing of stalker tendencies.I can't wait to see more of the series from this author, because I'm betting she's going to get even better. I'll also be checking out more of her other books in the meantime. So glad I found this! Four dollars was a bargain on this little gem. Seriously, I've spent way more on books that should have been titled \"Buyer's Remorse.\" Not sure about that cover. It bugs me when the models don't match the author's description of the characters, but I guess that's on the publishers. I will be so glad when they lose the lame book art, personally. Maybe one day.

I loved the book up to the VR sex, but it just didn't make sense - somehow a pair of glasses allowed the VR to tap into the participants brains, or otherwise give them sensations all over their bodies? And there were details like \"his taste\" that made no sense, unless somehow the VR program had been able to determine what one of the characters would taste like? I don't know. It was enough to pull me out of the book, and I think from then on I was reading a little more critically.The shower business pulled me out as well. I know it's not nice to think about our heroine having fun sexy times after being bled all over by a vampire-zombie, but it was weird that she just assumed a shower would work in a remote, abandoned homestead, and then even weirder that it did. I mean, it's not absolutely impossible that the water pressure was gravity driven, I guess, but that would certainly be the exception rather than the rule, so it was weird that the heroine, who's spent a lot of time roughing it, expected the shower to work.I was also a little confused by the infectiousness of the Shadow blood - at the start of the book the heroine is careful to not even let it touch her boots, and she sterilizes her knife before putting it away, but then later on she's bathed in it and the issue of infection isn't really mentioned.These are just quibbles, obviously, but they (and a few others like them) pulled me out of the story. And it wouldn't have been that hard to fix them, which makes this sort of a frustrating review to write.I'm going to read at least one more by Alisha Rai, I think, because it wasn't like this was terrible. But I'm not quite as enthusiastic as I was after reading the first book by her."}, {"userName": "Sarah Jane", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25800373-sarah-jane", "userReview": "August 2015 book club pick. Picked on the recommendation of the NPR summer of romance books series.Interesting book! First off, I fucking hate zombies more than anything. I really wanted to give this book less stars based on that fact but it's not really fair. In the first chapter or two I was reeeally curious where the heck this was going and how our love interests are ever going to get together (though I've got to say I've never read a book with virtual reality sexytimes before, so that was a first). But yeah, James and Jules were excellent and likeable and I kind of wish I could read a story with them in it but without zombies, that would be perfect :)This was my first Alisha Rai and I've got to say that I will most certainly be reading more! I really enjoyed her writing style and the tone of the story with a few laugh out loud moments thrown in. Definitely not a \"fluffy\" romance though, this one got a little serious. The story also just literally ends without warning. There's no cliffhanger or anything, but there's been this building up to this other mystery and then....nothing. And given that this was written a few years ago, I kind of doubt we'll ever find out what the heck that was all about. I can't even begin to imagine how to follow this book up and still keep a lightheartedish and romantic story going. The #1 thing that I HATED about this book though? Absolutely 0 discussion about protection. You better believe in a post-apocalyptic world there should be some concern about getting knocked up or transmitting dangerous bodily fluids and turning part zombie. Gah, it just took me right out of the story. Really, a couple of lines explaining how the human race is sterile or something, anything, would have saved me from visions of a sequel with a god awful impossible baby storyline."}, {"userName": "eRomantix", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20708501-eromantix", "userReview": "Originally posted at http://eromantix.com/wordpress/I have read contemporary romance from this same author and loved it. Would her talent translate well into apocalyptic fiction? I have to say \u201cYes\u201d! This was a well written compleat full length book. The action kept you going from page one. It starts with Jules on the road searching for a lost friend. She has left her post as a tracker for her personal quest to track down old friend Eric (don\u2019t worry, platonic relationship).Her remote handler James is with her every step of the way. As she strays into dangerous territory his true feeling for her start to show. With any Zombie book there was the constant threat of the \u201cShadows\u201d attacking. This was quickly overshadowed by a much more malevolent threat to Jules. But I won\u2019t spoil anything for you guys you will have to read it to find out.Jules was great, really tough but also not stupid. Her background certainly gives her an edge. You can see how somebody with her skills would end up doing well in a world gone crazy. James was certainly a different hero. No alpha male here, he uses his gifts in other ways. It was a refreshing change. He certainly stepped up when Jules needed him and he felt real. He and Jules were a good match they played to each other strengths. Even though they came from different backgrounds.The cast of characters we were introduced to, was well-rounded and developed. You really want to see what happens to them in future books.

Unfortunately there isn't as much of it as I would like. There is a lot of post-apocalyptic no romance and some post-apocalyptic bad romance but this book gets it just right.The characters are every day people in extraordinary circumstances and they felt very relatable to me. Jules is the kind of action heroine I like. Brave without being fearless. Strong without sacrificing her emotions. Experienced without being cynical. I love that she'd never killed a human before and that when she does it's not just kill and move on. I didn't really feel the Spanish though, it was too much and at the same time not enough. For the amount of Spanish she spoke I expected her to think in Spanish more than she did. But that was a minor issue for me and it didn't stop me from enjoying the story.James is also a real hero, conquering his fears and making sacrifices for the woman he loves, there's nothing more sexy than that.I hope there will be more stories set in this world because I love it.

Zombies are no longer a shocker in pop culture, but the Shadows of this world remind me more of the creatures from the movie version of I Am Legend - not shambling corpses, but humans stripped to their basest natures and animal instinct. Add in some mad scientists and you've got yourselves a post-apocalyptic horror story! James is a perfect nerd/beta hero. He is behind Jules 100%, even when he is just a voice in her ear. I really liked the premise of having the H/H fall in love with no visual to go on. It's kind of like the ultimate long-distance romance, or getting to know one another through letters. Neither James or Jules is perfect, but they are both committed to doing their best in trying circumstances and helping others as much as they are able. Doing so means meeting and overcoming personal challenges for each and learning to trust in someone besides themselves.I really hope that GR labeling this as ShadowLands #1 isn't a fluke and there will be more written in this world!!"}, {"userName": "SaturNalia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4516466-saturnalia", "userReview": "3.5 really. Beta hero's and zombies are not my thing, but I love the author and gave this a try. James and Jules know each other but have never met, and they stay separated for most of the story. But they know each other inside out, because they constantly talk. There was a lot of zombie action, which kept pulling me out of their romance and I skimmed until they were finally together. I was more interested in Erik's story, so I can't wait till it comes out.It's well written and the unconventional romance between the leads was believable. The world created was interesting. I will definitely be getting the next installment."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3161958-sandra", "userReview": "This was somewhere between a 3 & 4 star for me rounded up because the main characters Jules & James were so awesome and sweet together. Jules is a great strong, kick-ass heroine and I loved James. He isn't a traditional Alpha male (in my view he is better) He overcomes his phobia to search for Jules, he is still competent and can take care of himself, he appreciates Jules for who she is and he is proud of how kick ass she is. And yes he would like to protect her but knowing who and accepting who she is he does this by supporting and helping her."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2460149-ellen", "userReview": "Set in a Post-Apocalyptic world.Product warning says it well :A hero who would fight monsters for his lady love, a kick butt heroine out to save the world, a treacherous wasteland, poetry as foreplay and flesh-eating enemies.Throw in mad scientients -doctors who are in a rogue organization, a lost friend Erik, and some really cool communication devices and you have a great book.It was a fast paces adventure with great world building and a unique relationships between Jules and James.Look forward to the next book."}, {"userName": "Suleikha Snyder", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5013622-suleikha-snyder", "userReview": "Alisha Rai's ShadowLands series-starter is a road movie meets a long-distance relationship meets a zombie apocalypse, with a tough but vulnerable heroine, a determined beta hero and an intriguing premise! Jules and James falling for one another via comm conversations alone is reminiscent of classic epistolary novels, and Rai deftly uses Robert Frost's poetry to strengthen that emotional bond. Night Whispers will definitely have readers clamoring for more in this universe."}, {"userName": "Keith Melton", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4677809-keith-melton", "userReview": "The hero is kinda beta, but he's still the man. In fact, he's even more the man because he's a bit beta. I was cheering when he overcame some of the challenges his character faced. The (at first) long distance relationship seems like a difficult thing to pull off in an action romance, but it's done quite well. Gotta love Jules. My kind of character. Well done, Alisha Rai.

Both of those teachings come in handy now that her job description includes protecting humans and kicking Shadow ass. But it\u2019s hard to keep her mind strictly on her mission when all she can think about is the man whose voice keeps her sane through the depths of each dark night.When Jules is captured and threatened by a rogue organization even more bloodthirsty than the Shadows, James must draw on all of his courage to fuel a furious cross-country chase through the lawless land\u2026before the Jules he loves is destroyed forever.Product WarningsContains a hero who would fight monsters for his love, a heroine out to save the world, a treacherous wasteland, poetry as foreplay and flesh-eating enemies.", "title": "Night Whispers\n      \n          (ShadowLands #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15771200-night-whispers", "average": 4.03, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1343310414l/15771200.jpg", "reviews": 43, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2987418.Alisha_Rai", "name": "Alisha Rai"}], "type": ["Romance", "Horror", "Apocalyptic", "Romance", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15771200-night-whispers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19366800-night-whispers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29422692-hate-to-want-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6619109-glutton-for-pleasure", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34217566-wrong-to-need-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23569243-a-gentleman-in-the-street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12386784-hot-as-hades"]}
