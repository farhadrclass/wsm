Tyson is an audible book I got from the library and I am not sure I am glad or not. I knew the story but not the details. I wanted to know but didn't want to know. It was so horrific, I didn't know if I could stand to hear it, to know that people stood by and let murderers go free. Did I want to live it? I did want to know because the world is turning backwards in any progress that has been made. Those of us that want the world to live in peace have to spread the word that Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr preached, not the trash that is vomited from the WH tweets. I listened to the book and cried. The book may have pictures but since I had the audible version I googled Emmett's pictures. What a handsome young man! What a shame. The book is filled with details as to why he was there and not in Chicago. The \"witnesses\", later to claim it never happened. All the details of the times, the town, the people involved. How they got away with murder and three weeks later confessed but couldn't be convicted then. (Sold their story to Look magazine.) All because he whistled at a woman. I wonder what they would think if they knew we would have a rich, nasty man that brags about how many times he grabs women by their...and people voted this same scumbag to be the leader of the country...what is wrong with this country?"}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32799998-erin", "userReview": "Black Lives DON'T Matter. This country has been going out of its way to prove that for centuries and continues till this very day. Black Lives have never mattered. Emmett Till may have been murdered over 60 years ago but in reality this country is still killing him today. In Letters from a Birmingham Jail Dr. King writes that his worst enemies are not members of The Klan but \"white moderates\" who claim to support the goals of the movement but deplores its methods of protest.Emmett Till became a martyr to the cause of Civil Rights 60 plus years ago and unfortunately we've lost the battle. November's election proved that. The President of the United States spent 8 years trying to prove that the 1st African-American President was a Kenyan Muslim. The new President seems to believe that all black people live in crime ridden, poverty stricken hellholes. This same man named as his Attorney General Jeff Sessions. A man who was deemed too racist to be a federal judge in the 1980's. A man who thinks The NAACP is unamerican, called black attorneys boy, and white civil rights attorneys race traitors. So yes America we get it now Black Lives Don't Matter and neither do the Lives of LGBTQ people or the Lives of Immigrants. I encourage everyone to read up on Emmett Till it doesn't have to be this book but please read about this child who was brutally tortured and killed for \"maybe\" whistling at a white woman. He was 14 years old and this country let his killers walk free because this child got what he deserved.

The boy whose lynching galvanized a global movement. Right now, the media seems to be afire with one of the revelations of this book: that Carolyn Bryant has finally admitted that she lied and that Emmett Till never accosted her. Other than her admission, that's not exactly a surprise. So what is the story of Emmett Till? While on a trip to Mississippi from his home in Chicago, he stopped in at Carolyn Bryant's store and bought candy from her. He may have said something pert to her. He may have put the money directly in her hand--physical contact, a taboo in Mississippi--rather than leaving it on the counter. He wolf whistled when she ran out after him in a fury to get the gun out of her car. JW Milam and Roy Bryant, Carolyn Bryant's husband and brother-in-law, pulled Emmett Till from his house, beat and whipped him for hours until his face and body were pulp, shot him in the head, tied his body with wire to a 74-pound industrial fan, and threw it into the Tallahatchie River.Here are the murderers, celebrating as they escape justice:Before she changed her story to attempted rape to provide an indefensible defense for a lynch mob, Bryant originally said only that Till \"insulted\" her. When her husband and brother-in-law came to lynch Emmett, they demanded that the family produce the boy who had done the \"smart talk.\" This pretense of the \"mystery\" of Emmett Till's case is and always has been utterly fatuous. As Carolyn Bryant herself said, \"Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him.\"The story of Emmett Till is so short, so heartbreaking. But the story of what comes after is both terrible and uplifting, and Timothy Tyson does the story justice. He starts by laying out the political backdrop, a necessary step to explain the meaning of Emmett Till's death to his killers and to those who mourned him. Emmett Till was not a naif to the world of bigotry and racism. Chicago was one of the most racially divided cities in America, and throughout his childhood, guerilla warfare raged over attempted housing desegregation. Dawson and Daley may have given lip service to equality, but they actively maintained segregation because it furthered their political ends. In both Chicago, as in Mississippi, black families kept loaded firearms in close reach, knowing that a lynch mob could burst through the door at any minute. Mississippi, on the other hand, \n\"outstripped the rest of the nation in virtually every measure of lynching.\"\n Vagrancy, a.k.a. \"Jobless while Black,\" was treated as a crime, and through the convict leasing programs, black \"criminals\" were leased out to plantations as slave labor. To get the ballot, prospective black voters were forced to answer questions like, \n\"Do you want your children to go to school with white children?\"\n or \n\"Are you a member or do you support the NAACP?\"\n Citizens' Councils, white supremacy groups formed in the wake of Brown v Board of Education, terrorized African Americans with \"personal visits\" and by publishing their names, addresses, and phone numbers in newspapers. As with the present practice of doxxing, lynch mobs were never far behind. And it worked. As Tyson notes, \n\"In the seven counties with a population more than 60 percent black, African Americans cast a combined total of two votes in 1954.\"\n Citizens' councils were obsessed with maintaining white supremacy in the face of the federal government's decrees, and for them, as Tyson puts it, \n\"The unsullied Southern white woman became the most important symbol of white male superiority.\"\n Emmett's death was, for his murderers, about keeping African-Americans in their place, and fearmongers used the \n\"the old song of the Bruised Southern Lily and the Black Beast Rapist\"\n to whip whites into hysterical furor. As J.W. Milam, one of Till's murderer's, put it:\"As long as I live and can do anything about it, n** are going to stay in their place. N** ain't gonna vote where I live. If they did, they'd control the government. They ain't gonna go to school with my kids. And when a n** even gets close to mentioning sex with a white woman, he's tired o' livin'. I'm likely to kill him.\" Interviews showed later that none of the jurors ever doubted that Milam and Bryant were guilty, but they simply didn't consider the murder of a black boy who insulted a white woman to be a crime.Emmett's death came after a host of assassinations of various civil rights leaders whose murders were treated as \"accidents.\" Despite the coroner's verdict, the mutilations, the bullet, the fan hog-tied to the body, the local newspapers still termed the death an \n\"odd accident\"\n and Sheriff Shelton claimed that the bullet fragments were \n\"most likely filings from his teeth\"\n and put about the theory that the whole case was a fake concocted by the NAACP. If it hadn't been for Mamie Till, Emmett's death would have been just another lynching. But her strength and determination and courage transformed his death into \n\"a watershed historical moment.\"\n As she said, \"I took the privacy of my own grief and turned it into a public issue, a political issue, one which set in motion the dynamic force that ultimately led to a generation of social and legal progress for this country.\"The Blood of Emmett Till is an exceptional work. Not only does it bring humanity to the major players; it also vividly details the political and cultural backdrop and the global movement that Mamie Till and her allies galvanized. The writing and story are so compelling that I found myself racing through it like a thriller, even though I knew the outcome. Tyson captures the pathos, but also the hope, the bravery, the valiant actions of the witnesses who, like Moses Wright, stood in front of a white court and accused a white man.If you want a better understanding of racism and the Civil Rights movement, add The Blood of Emmett Till to your list. I'll leave you with a quote: \"That we blame the murderous pack is not the problem; even the idea that we can blame the black boy is not so much the problem, though it is absurd. The problem is why we blame them: we do so to avoid seeing that the lynching of Emmett Till was caused by the nature and history of America itself and by a social system that has changed over the decades, but not so much as we pretend. [...]Ask yourself whether America's predicament is really so different now. [...] We are still killing black youth because we have not yet killed white supremacy.\"\n\n~~I received this ebook through Netgalley from Simon & Schuster in exchange for my honest review.

The last chapter is an impassioned plea for progress against hate and the United State's institutionalization of racism.II already knew about 14 year old Emmitt Till's murder at the hands of white supremacists that was the catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement from the brilliant PBS series, Eyes on the Prize. Tyson does bring one new item to the story, he interviewed Carolyn Bryant, the white woman at the center of it, who Emmitt whistled at, and was the impetus for his killing by her husband and brother-in-law.I would have thought that the author could have done a little more digging, perhaps all of the people from that time are dead, but there was a young black man who was a witness at the trial who was only 18 at the time. Perhaps, he could have been tracked down as well? Tyson relies on the trial excerpts to tell the details and headlines and newspaper articles from the period, but he brings no skin to the game. His telling us dry and clinical until the last chapter. When I saw the story on PBS I was riveted, horrified, and griefstricken. This account is very unemotional until the last and I would have liked to have experienced the No! that I felt while watching this powerful and must-be-told story."}, {"userName": "jv poore", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5157918-jv-poore", "userReview": "Just shared this book with \"my\" high school seniors.

Tyson's work provides much more detail about Till's family, the murderers' families, the impact of Till's death on the civil rights movement, and the reactions of other countries to the Till case. Listening to the book on audio, the book got a bit muddled in the middle as Tyson explained all the various civil rights leaders working throughout the country. I had a hard time keeping the names straight (this might have been easier had I read the text instead of listening to it). The final chapters -- where Tyson offers his analysis vs. a litany of names, dates, and places -- are exceptional.Make no mistake -- this book will stir thoughts and emotions that will not settle easily. Fourteen year-old Emmett Till was brutally beaten and murdered because he had the \"audacity\" to whistle at a white woman. In 1955 Mississippi, acquittal for the defendants was a foregone conclusion (part of the defense was that Till \"had it coming\"). Once acquitted and out of danger of double jeapordy, the defendants -- Milam and Bryant -- spoke quite openly about the murder. Although one would wish that the sentiments in their chilling remarks be relegated to history, it is wise to listen and be aware that sadly, these views continue to exist today:\"Outside Bryant\u2019s grocery, the youths dared Till to ask Carolyn Bryant for a date. He did so. Hearing the tale, Milam and Bryant kidnapped the boy from his great-uncle\u2019s farmhouse intending meerly to beat him, but Till taunted them \u2026and proclaimed his own equality\u2026\u2018We were never able to scare him,\u2019 Milam [admitted]. \u2018They had just filled him so full of that poison he was hopeless.\u2019The men took turns smashing Till across the head with their 45s. The boy never yelled, but continued to say things like \u2018You bastards, I\u2019m not afraid of you. I\u2019m as good as you are. My grandmother was a white woman.\u2019Milam made their case, \u2018Well, what else could we do? It was hopeless. I\u2019m no bully. I never hurt a ni**er. I like ni**ers \u2013 in their place. I know how to work \u2018em. But I just decided it was time a few people got put on notice. As long as I live and can do anything about it, ni**ers are gonna stay in their place. Ni**ers ain\u2019t gonna vote where I live -- if they did they\u2019d control the government. They ain\u2019t gonna go to school with my kids. And when a ni**er even gets close to mentioning sex with a white woman, he\u2019s tired of livin\u2019. I\u2019m likely to kill him.

This book lays out everything from what led Till to be in Mississippi in the first place all the way up to the events that followed the acquittal of his murderers. However between those events, this book does have a disappointing amount of, what can only be described as, filler. In chapter five for example there is a literal list of all the kinds of candy that could be found for sale in the store that Emmett Till later went into. This goes on for two pages, where the author is just listing out things that were sold in the store. These pages of filler all together needlessly dragged the book down.

This book, The Blood of Emmett Till by Timothy B. Tyson, in my view, does not add a great deal to the knowledge that has been available for all of these years; but he DOES an excellent job of taking what is known about the murder of this 14 year-old boy and placing it in a broader national, international, political and social context.In August, 1955 14 year-old Emmett Till left his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley's home in Chicago and traveled to the town of Money in the Mississippi Delta to spend time with relatives. While there, Emmett and some of his cousins went to buy candy at the Bryant Grocery. What actually occurred between Emmett Till and Carolyn Bryant, the woman who was operating the cash register that day, is not known; however, Mrs. Bryant reported to her husband Roy Bryant and police that Emmett Till had been 'inappropriate' with her. A variety of stories have been told over the years... one story told by Mrs. Bryant was that Emmett had grabbed her and talked 'obscenely' to her, informing her that he had seduced other white women. The author Mr. Tyson suggests that Emmett perhaps had simply been unaware of the social norms which forbade physical contact between blacks and whites and had mistakenly touched her hand when given the change due him from the candy purchase. Regardless of what transpired that August day in the Bryant Grocery, what was done to Emmett Till was horrendous and incomprehensible. Carolyn Bryant's husband, Roy and his half-brother, J. W. Milam dragged Emmett Till from his bed in the middle of the night, beat him until he was virtually unrecognizable, shot him in the head and tossed his body into the Tallahatchie River with the fan from a cotton gin tied around his body. As shocking as this crime was, it actually was not unique in and of itself at the time. According to statistics from the Tuskegee Institute, between the years 1882- 1968, 3,446 African Americans were lynched. During this time period, there was at least one lynching in every state in the United States... 581 were reported in Mississippi alone. The murder of Emmett Till turned out to be unique because of the events that followed... events which truly sparked a movement. As Mr. Tyson discussed, the Supreme Court's decision in the case Brown v Board of Education in 1954, found that state laws which allowed for separate public schools for blacks and whites were unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. This decision was a tremendous victory and provided impetus for the Civil Rights Movement; but the leaders of the movement were finding it difficult to garner the needed attention from an American public with a short attention span. This decision by the Supreme Court was not popular in all places; in fact, it was responsible for a great deal of social anxiety and unrest... especially in the South. It was the actions of Emmett Till's mother, Mamie, that provided the spark which led to the Civil Rights Movement capturing not only the attention and imagination of the American public but that of the world. Mamie Till-Mobley, against the wishes of authorities and with the support of the NAACP, decided to display her son's battered body to the public in an open coffin. In Chicago, hundreds of people filed past the boy's coffin and got an up-close look at what had been done to him. At the same time in Mississippi, Roy Bryant and J. W. Milam's murder trial was being held. The two men were quickly acquitted and in an interview, the jury foreman stated that the jury had been told to \"make it look good.\"Jurors also stated in later interviews that they never had doubts that the defendants were guilty but they had all agreed that if a black boy insulted a white woman, her kin could not be blamed for retaliation. As is often the case in the United States, the government and the public in its shortsightedness, did not predict the world's outrage at the violent death of the young African American boy and the subsequent 'not guilty' verdict. As the photos of the open coffin of Emmett Till made their way around the world, pressure... political and economic pressure... began to mount. A French newspaper at the time called the verdict in the Till case \"an insult to the conscience of the civilized world.\" The shared international consensus was that the verdict was one more example of America's hypocrisy on race. In short, America did not practice the democracy it preached. The pressure was on to force Congress to pass an anti-lynching bill. The world's outrage and the mounting political and economic pressure combined with the efforts of African American newspapers and the NAACP, led to the increased public awareness that the Civil Rights Movement had been hoping and looking for. The Civil Rights Movement would gain steam and strength and also struggle through the next decade resulting in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voter Rights Act of 1965. Sadly and frustratingly, progress never seem to follow a straight line. One additional aspect of this book which I felt was important to mention was that Mr. Tyson touched briefly on the Black Lives Matter movement which has sprung up in communities across the country. After numerous cases of unjustified force against young black men by police officers, people are once again mobilizing to protest. Mr. Tyson provides several limited explanations or contributing factors for what has been happening over the last decade (or more).. economic insecurity and anxiety due to the financial crisis, the election of the first African American president in the U. S., the militarization of community police forces and the mass incarceration of young black men. I agree that all of these factors have contributed at least in part and I'm sure people will continue to debate and protests will continue. But once again, Emmett Till's name is being invoked in remembrance to once again raise the awareness of a people sometimes slow to stand for justice. As William Faulkner stated in 1955 when asked to comment on the Emmett Till case.. \"If we in America have reached the point in our desperate culture where we must murder children, we don't deserve to survive and probably won't.\" Indeed. * This book was marketed in part on the promise of relating what Mrs. Carolyn Bryant had to say to the author in an interview in 2008.. If you are planning to read this book solely to discover that Mrs. Bryant has somehow evolved considerably on this issue or has provided some new piece of information regarding what REALLY happened... don't bother. Her memory, you see, appears to be quite faulty... after all, who can remember something from over 50 years ago?** I am including a link to a 'Jet' magazine article regarding Emmett Till. Please be advised there is a photo which is quite disturbing and may not be for everyone!https://www.awesomestories.com/asset/..."}, {"userName": "Steven Z.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17428284-steven-z", "userReview": "At a time when the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement continues to gain momentum it is interesting to contemplate what the turning point was for the Civil Rights Movement. In his new book THE BLOOD OF EMMETT TILL, Timothy B. Tyson argues that the lynching of Emmett Till on August 28, 1955, by two white men in rural Mississippi was the tipping point. It appears their actions were in part motivated by the 1954 Supreme Court\u2019s Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, KA decision outlawing \u201cseparate but equal,\u201d a landmark case that lit a fire under white supremacists in the south. Shortly thereafter, Rosa Parks refused to move to the back of the bus in Birmingham, AL and events began to snowball. Tyson reexamines the murder of Till and explores what really happened that night. The author includes new material gained from his 2007 interview of Carolyn Bryant who was supposedly the victim of some sort of offensive behavior that violated Mississippi\u2019s unwritten code that existed between whites and blacks. It seems that Bryant\u2019s memory of what transpired after fifty years has changed, which makes it even more disconcerting in exploring the plight of Emmett Till.In her interview Bryant changed her story from the testimony given in the trial of her husband Roy Bryant, and brother-in-law, J.W. \u201cBig\u201d Milam who were accused of murdering Till. Her testimony \u201cthat Till grabbed her around the waist and uttered obscenities\u201d was not true. Till did not grab her, but the all-white jury acquitted both men of the murder. Till a fourteen year old boy and his cousin, Wheeler Parker who lived in Chicago\u2019s south side were visiting their uncle Reverend Moses Wright who was a sharecropper on the G.C. Plantation in the Mississippi Delta. Both boys were not ignorant of the mores of white-black relations in Mississippi, but what is key to the story is what actually happened when Till entered the Milam country store and interacted with Mrs. Bryant. That night Till was seized from Wright\u2019s house by Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam and was severely beaten, shot in the head, and dumped in a river twelve miles from the murder scene. Tyson provides detailed accounts of August 28, 1955, the return of Till\u2019s body to Chicago, the arrest and trial of the two men, the effect on American society, the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement, and the world wide reaction to the verdict which played into the hands of the Soviet Union in the heart of the Cold War.For Tyson, the key to the reaction to Till\u2019s murder was the behavior and strategy pursued by his mother, Mamie Bradley. Once she learned of her son\u2019s kidnapping she decided that \u201cshe would not go quietly\u201d and began calling Chicago newspapers as she realized there were no officials in Mississippi she could appeal to. Sheriff Clarence Strider of Tallahatchie County was put in charge of the investigation despite the fact the murder occurred outside his jurisdiction. For Strider and other county officials the goal was to bury Till as soon as possible and let the situation blow over. Bradley refused to cooperate and demanded that her son be returned to Chicago for burial. Once that occurred Bradley\u2019s only weapon to make sure her son\u2019s death had meaning was his body. During the viewing and funeral she made sure that the casket was open so the public could learn the truth of how her son was tortured and then murdered, and learn what Mississippi \u201cjustice\u201d was all about. Because of the new medium of television and newspaper photographs of the mutilated body the entire country was now a witness to the results of the lynching.Tyson does an excellent job bringing the reader inside the courtroom and explaining why the two murderers were acquitted. He digs deep into Mississippi\u2019s historical intolerance of African-Americans and how they should behave and be employed. Tyson reviews the plight of Black America through World War II and touches on the hope that returning black veterans who fought for democracy would be treated differently after the war. This did not occur nationwide, particularly in Mississippi. However, as the Civil Rights Movement shifted its strategy toward enforcing its voting rights and employing the economic weapon, Mississippians grew scared and became even more violent towards African-Americans, and with the Brown decision men like Bryant and Miam were exorcised to the point of lynching Till.Tyson presents a concise history of intimidation, violence, and murder that African-Americans confronted each day in Mississippi. As the NAACP grew and demands for voting rights and desegregation expanded the powers that be in Mississippi grew worried. They relied on people like Thomas Brady, a Mississippi Circuit Court Judge and occupant of a seat on the state\u2019s Supreme Court to create the \u201cCitizens Council Movement\u201d to espouse the propaganda of race mixing and the threat to southern womanhood as the gospel of the white south. In fact, the defense in the Till trial leaned on the threat of southern womanhood in its argument that gained the acquittal. The fact that the trial itself took place only twenty days after the murder in of itself reflects the lack of proper investigation. Further, the threats and coercion to prevent witnesses from testifying is testimony to the lack of justice. In fact, a few who did testify for the prosecution, uprooted their lives in Mississippi and moved to Chicago for fear of retribution.The person in this drama who should feel ashamed of themselves is Carolyn Bryant whose lies contributed to the acquittal of Till\u2019s murderers. It is a shame that there is a statute of limitations for perjury because she was certainly guilty. Her show of \u201cconscience,\u201d for this reader is fifty years too late.Reading this book can only make one angry about America\u2019s past and one would hope that race would no longer be a factor in our society. But in fact it is. We witnessed race baiting throughout the last presidential campaign and as a society we have not come to terms with the idea of \u201cequal justice under the law.\u201d Tyson\u2019s book should be read in the context of history, but also as a vehicle to contemporary understanding. As Tyson aptly points out, the death of Emmett Till \u201cwas caused by the nature and history of America itself and by a social system that has changed over the decades, but not as much as we pretend.\u201d (208) One wonders if the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO will be as transformative an episode as the death of Emmett Till."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean", "userReview": "In 1955 an all-white male jury found the two white defendants not guilty of killing a black boy even though they had confessed to the crime. This is one of the worst incidents of \u201cSouthern Justice\u201d in our nation\u2019s history. The victim was a fourteen-year-old black boy from Chicago who was visiting a relative in Mississippi. The boy who had polio when younger was accused of provoking a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, with a wolf whistle and flirtation. Her husband, Roy Brant and her half -brother, J. W. Milan, then beat-up and lynched the boy.Many books have been written about this case. What sets Tyson\u2019s book apart is the broad view he used to examine the lynching. Tyson does an excellent job with the courtroom scenes. The book is well written and meticulously researched. Tyson examined the records including the trial transcripts and interviews of most of the people involved, including a rare interview with the late Carolyn Bryant. Apparently, Carolyn Bryant wrote her memoir. The manuscript and related papers have been sealed until 2038. The author delves into the social and economic forces that drove Roy Bryant and J. W. Milan to kill Till. Tyson then ties up the case to include the ongoing problems of inequality of justice for blacks today. Tyson is a historian at Duke University so the book is more academic than many books written on the subject.I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. The book is just over eight and a half hours long. Rhett S. Price does a good job narrating the book. Price is an actor and audiobook narrator."}, {"userName": "Tom Mathews", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22063432-tom-mathews", "userReview": "When asked to think of a picture of a truly heroic action, many people will think of the lone Chinese protester facing off a row of tanks in Tiananmen Square. After finishing Timothy B. Tyson\u2019s magnificent new book, I now see a different picture. As photographs go it isn\u2019t much but the story behind it makes shivers run down my spine. The image is of Moses Wright, a lanky black sharecropper and great uncle of 14-year-old Emmett Till. In the photograph the 64-year old Wright, standing tall in a white shirt, black tie, and suspenders, pointing across a Mississippi courtroom at the two white men charged with Till\u2019s kidnapping an murder. This may not sound like much, but many people sitting in that courtroom were convinced that they were witnessing an act of suicide. No black man who enjoyed living would ever testify against a white man. And yet he did it. This is just one of many tremendous acts of courage described in this account of the lynching of Till and the trial that arguably served as a catalyst for the protests of the Civil Rights Era. I\u2019ve often heard of the case but never knew before now how integral a part it played in the campaign to defeat Jim Crow. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I sincerely hope that everyone reads it. This was a very dark time in our history that we should never forget.

Yes, some things have changed; the kind of violence that snatched Till\u2019s life strikes only rarely. A white supremacist gunman slaughtering nine black churchgoers in a prayer meeting in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2014, however, reminds us that the ideology of white supremacy remains with us in its most brutal and overt forms.\"We are still killing Emmett Till, with our silence, our generalizing, our refusal to see the problem or by calling violent events a \"one-off, the work of one crazy person\". We haven't changed as much as we like to think and we are still killing Emmett Till.Update November 30th, 2017: This has turned out to be one of my most liked reviews on Goodreads and even though I read the book way back in January, some 400 plus books ago, this one still haunts me. The epilogue has helped me focus my lifelong search for understanding and a focus on Civil Rights then and now, especially considering the current political climate. Call me an idealist, but I've never understood the hatred of or the difference between races, religions, or even cultures 'other' than our own. We all have the same or similar dreams for our lives and children if we have them. We all cry the same tears, live through the same heartaches and disappointments, celebrate successes as they come, and even bleed the same damn color. The 'wrongness' of all of this has been with me since childhood and it isn't like it was something we discussed at the dinner table or that my parents were strongly one way or another, racist or not, if anything, growing up in a predominately white area of Southern CA and then being at UCLA during the last days of the Civil Rights area, they were somewhat isolated from all of it. (Although my mom does like to mention that she had Kareem Abdul Jabar in one of her classes, all she says is that he was really tall. Her being 5'2' in shoes, this isn't exactly surprising. )It was just a vital truth that came from inside me, but being an introvert with anxiety issues, I've never been able to figure out how to take part and be a soldier in the change. This book helped me realize that with every act, we are all part of the change or the continuation of this. If we allow a derogatory comment to slip by without calling someone on it, we are part of the problem. If we cross the street when we see someone different, either black, seemingly mentally ill, developmentally disabled, or wearing a burka. we are part of the problem. If we aren't willing to shake each and every hand that is put out to us, we are part of the problem. If we don't bother to learn about different cultures, either by immersion and face to face interactions or by reading, we are part of the problem.As basically a hermit, I read and learn constantly and that brings me a greater understanding and respect. Although sometimes I get so fired up that I feel ready to take on the world about this issue, I know that with my mental health issues that isn't sustainable. I can be a small part, however, through my gaining of understanding and respect by my reading, by shaking every hand, by returning every smile, by speaking up or calling someone out when I see or hear an issue, and by using my words on the screen. Right now, I'm just not in a position to do more. I hope to be less of a hermit someday be able to volunteer more and be a part of larger changes. It's the least I can do for Emmett Till and all of those that lost and continue to lose their lives in this battle along with those continuing to suffer from all of the crap thrown at them or walls built in their way in their everyday lives. We are all the same and until every single person realizes this, we will continue to be killing Emmett Till and that's not okay."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62695678-ashley", "userReview": "\"To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time\" - James BaldwinThis quote perfectly encapsulates my existence at the moment. When I think of all the grave injustices that have been done to black people it makes me physically ill. I had to read this book in chunks because it's too much (emotionally) to digest in a couple sittings. It made me angry, sad and tearful.I've known about Emmett Till for many years but just recently have I been trying to delve deeper into the story and learn more about the details. Emmett was only 14 years old when these 2 savages kidnapped him in the middle of the night, tortured him, mutilated his body and dumped him in the Tallahatchie River for allegedly whistling at a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, and \"molesting\" her as the defense attorneys noted in court. These savages felt confident in murdering Emmett with impunity. They even admitted to kidnapping Emmett but were still found not guilty by the jury. And as we now know, Carolyn lied. A 14 year old boy was murdered all based on a lie. Even if she wasn't lying what happened to Emmett shouldn't have happened. Mamie Till-Mobley exhibited so much strength and resolve throughout this horrific ordeal. Her decision to have an open casket and turn it into a public issue really galvanized a national movement and showed the world what black people faced (still face) in America. I think this story resonates so much with me because I have a black son, my only child, and to think of something like that happening to him makes me sick.

I can't imagine growing up in such a racially tense, segregated and unequal time. We still deal with racism but of course it's more concealed and we have laws now that were put in place to help...they don't always but back then there was barely any protection for blacks. It's not like I didn't know about these events before but I'm still trying to wrap my mind around the fact that it hasn't been that long since lynching was a common occurrence, since the right to vote for \"colored\" was allowed and without threats or intimidation, since blacks couldn't use the same bathroom, attend the same schools or eat in certain places, had to address whites as sir and ma'am while they were addressed as boy, gal, nigger....

The hook, which has been emphasized in almost every media account, is that Tyson, one of the two or three most important historians of race working today, interviewed the \"woman in the case,\" who admits that she made up and embellished most of the detail that contributed to Till's lynching. The fact is that anyone even vaguely conversant with the racial situation in Mississippi pretty much knew that without the confession. The real importance of the confession is that it will get readers to pick up a book that has much much deeper significance, telling a story that's still playing out in the world of Black Lives Matter.Beyond the headline, The Blood of Emmett Till is an incisive beautifully written history of the culture of White Supremacy and Black Resistance. Usually presented as a kind of Southern horror story, the lynching was in fact the inevitable (and not unique) outgrowth of the South's rejection of the Brown vs. Board of Education decision and the White Citizen Councils' fomenting of a violent response their \"respectable\" members didn't have to take responsibility for. It's a bit like Trump's respectable supporters pretending they bear no responsibility for the internet trolls and thugs empowered by their rhetoric of freedom and liberty. Tyson provides chapter and verse on the networks connecting the Senate of James Eastland and Strom Thurmond and the men who brutalized Till.Equally important is the way Tyson fills in the background and interregional complexity of African American resistance. He tells the stories of men like Amzie Moore and other black veterans who built networks of local people fighting for their rights and basic human dignity. Till's uncle Moses Wright, who testified in the court case, rose to his moment in the spotlight, but it's clear that the culture of black Mississippi had nurtured many others like him, fully aware of the risks they were taking and committed to a long struggle that required negotiation of a treacherous and outwardly demeaning culture. Tyson's chapter on Protest Politics brilliantly demonstrates that the Till case played a central role in uniting African American resistance in the South and the North, especially black Chicago, and that those stories in turn played out on a global stage involving the decolonizing nations of Africa and Asia. The US had a problem presenting itself as the bastion of freedom when pictures of Till's grotesquely damaged body appeared on the front pages of Djakarta and Nairobi.The final section of Blood connects the Till story with the reality that young African Americans, especially but not exclusively young black men, continue to die on the streets of America. Emmett Till wasn't a saint or an angel; he was an ordinary kid. So are the vast majority of those murdered by police in circumstances more fitting for a totalitarian state. The rhetoric of White Supremacy hasn't even changed much. It *always* came wrapped in platitudes. And African Americans and their allies (less numerous than our self-serving mythologies would have it, but nonetheless potentially crucial) have always found ways to resist."}, {"userName": "Skip", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1389748-skip", "userReview": "A meticulously-researched book about the kidnapping and lynching of 14-year old, Chicagoan Emmett Till, while visiting his family in Mississippi in 1955.

However, I didn't like that large parts of the narrative consisted of direct quotations extracted from numerous other publications on the topic. Given that the author is clearly more than competent as a writer, I would have preferred to \"hear\" more of his own voice. I also felt the writer took an overly charitable view of Carolyn Bryant's role in this heinous crime, especially as she had admitted her own perjury to him. Finally, the epilogue while representing a powerful and moving call to arms (metaphorically speaking) for the further advancement of civil rights, felt to me a bit disconnected from the main text which preceded it. The entire book before that was successful in elucidating the conditions which allowed that great injustice to Emmett Till to happen.

I was blown away by the book's power. It lays bare the violent, sadistic actions white people took against black people... in the name of \"white purity\" and \"the southern way of life.\" For the uninitiated, Emmitt was a 14-year-old black kid from Chicago summering with his mother's people in rural Mississippi. He spoke to a white woman clerk at a small grocery, in broad daylight amid dozens of witnesses, and left a few minutes later. Her husband, his brother and a handful of other white supremacists brutally beat the kid to death. And conflated his speaking with the white woman with attempted rape.Amazing. Disgusting. And that this happened just 60 years ago makes me glad we've come as far as we have regarding social justice. We still have a ways to go, but at least this is seen as the unseemly immoral horror it is.That said, what makes this book more powerful was learning about the drive of Emmitt's mother. She was devastated, but instead of succumbing to despair, she used the death of her son to galvanize the nascent Civil Rights movement. And often at great physical danger to herself. Godspeed. since that's being a moral Christian... but on steroids. A five-star guide to living in a country where alt-right white nationalists currently have teh ear of our president. I doubt Trump wants this America back, but the white supremacists like Richard Spencer do. I say, 'No thanks. I prefer 2018 to 1918... or 1818.Five stars.

In 1955, 14 year old Emmett Till left his mother in Chicago for the summer to spend time with his uncle on the Mississippi Delta. One day Emmett wandered into a store where a young Carolyn Bryant, a white woman, was behind the counter. What happened after that is unclear and largely depends on whose story you choose to listen to, but it set in motion a chain reaction where Emmett would be brutally tortured and killed by two local white men, one of whom was Bryant\u2019s husband.  The murder shocked the nation and did so again when the two men were acquitted by an all white jury, laying what many believe were the foundations of the modern civil rights movement. This book is about that murder and the people involved. More so however, it is about America, race, and place in the 1950\u2019s. Tyson does a marvellous job establishing the background of what that world looked like. It was a world with small town sheriffs who could have lunch with men accused of murder during their trial. It was a world where that same sheriff could every morning walk by a pool of black reporters visiting to report on the trial and say \u201cGood morning N-ers\u201d to them and nobody bats an eye. I had some familiarity with this case and the times it occurred in but Tyson really brings that moment to life. Now to that 15% The book opens with the author sitting down to tea and cake with Bryant, now in her 80\u2019s and wanting to talk about what happened that day. Or does she? This is where things get very murky and uncomfortable for me. Let\u2019s start with a quote from the author early in the book about what Bryant remembers from that day:\u201cFifty years later Carolyn summoned her courage to tell me that her testimony had not been true, even though she didn\u2019t remember what was true, but that nothing Emmett Till did could ever justify what had happened to him.\u201d I have a real problem with calling her courageous here. Courageous would have been not setting her husband on a 14 year old boy in the first place. Courageous would have been not lying 50 years earlier and bringing her husband to justice for cold blooded murder. It doesn\u2019t invalidate a lot of good in this book, but I find it difficult to reconcile the horrific details he chronicles of this murder with sympathy for the woman who could\u2019ve prevented it all. Were I writing a book about said murder and the person chiefly responsible admits they lied, surely there should be some condemnation right? Instead we get some fuzzy, mealy mouthed excuse that perhaps she isn\u2019t clear on what happened at this point. But she is clear that she lied about something. I found this sentence to be frustrating in the extreme.\u201cExactly what happened between Carolyn Bryant and Emmett Till at the store will never be revealed to a certainty, probably not even to her.\u201dNo. No. No. What the hell does this sentence even mean? It happened to her. How can the author claim the truth won\u2019t be known to her. She\u2019s on record as having lied. She said it earlier in your conversation. I\u2019m really disturbed by his lack of willingness to push her on this. What in the end is the purpose of speaking to her at all if she is either A) continuing to obfuscate her role in the murder or B) mentally incapacitated to the point that she is unreliable?(It should be mentioned that at the time of this interview, Bryant was in the process of publishing her own book about the murder so financial gain may also have been a motivation.)\u201cThe preponderance of evidence does tell us that almost from the moment of the incident between her and Emmett at the store on August 24, she was frightened of its escalating consequences and probably sought to avoid them.\u201dWhat is the preponderance of the evidence? Why are we projecting fear and timidity on a woman whose first reaction when she claims Emmett Till \u201csmart talked\u201d her was to go to her husband's car and pull out a revolver from under the seat. Hardly the actions of a shrinking violet. She also lied about what happened under oath, and continued to do so long after her husband and anyone else she may have been intimidated by had died. \u201cWhether or not she actually identified the boy (to her husband) is merely a matter of speculation; I have found no way to prove or disprove it.\u201d I\u2019m sorry, but this is a copout that he needs to be called on. We are supposed to believe that her husband went ahead and tortured and murdered a boy who he knew was innocent without ever searching for the real boy responsible? From the portrait the author himself presents of this man, that seems unlikely in the extreme. It is as likely as the story the sheriff in the case tried to present to the jury that the boy in the river wasn\u2019t Emmett Till but maybe someone who was hit by a car and dumped in the river. Why does the author give credence to the former theory but rightly ridicules the latter? This in many ways is a compelling and important book. It does many laudable things and the author makes some excellent points about collective responsibility in that often the people who stand by and say nothing are often as culpable if not more so for evil. However, when the author tries to paint Carolyn Bryant as a victim, or simply an old lady with failing memory who was young and got caught up in something beyond her control, it does a grave disservice to Emmett Till. It ignores her fingering Till to her husband knowing full well what the consequences would be. It ignores her lying under oath. It ignores her continuing to lie for 50 years. Ignoring unpleasant truths may be a way to sleep better at night, but it only pulls us further and further from true justice."}, {"userName": "Ren\u00e9e", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43092569-ren-e", "userReview": "Whew.

But that enfeebled faith is not nearly so insidious and lethal as its robust, covert and often unconscious cousin: the assumption that God has created humanity in a hierarchy of moral, cultural and intellectual worth, with lighter-skinned people at the top and darker-skinned people at the bottom...To see beyond the ghosts, all of us must develop the moral vision and political will to crush white supremacy \u2014 both the political program and the concealed assumptions. We have to come to grips with our own history \u2014 not only genocide, slavery, exploitation and systems of oppression, but also the legacies of those who resisted and fought back and still fight back. We must find what Dr. King called the \u201cstrength to love.\u201d New social movements must confront head-on the racial chasm in American life. \u201cNot everything that is faced can be changed,\u201d Baldwin instructs, \u201cbut nothing can be changed until it is faced.\u201dYou can read a longer excerpt in the Atlanta Journal Constitution: http://specials.myajc.com/emmett-till/"}], "description": "This reexamines a pivotal event of the civil rights movement\u2014the 1955 lynching of Emmett Till. In 1955, white men in the Mississippi Delta lynched a fourteen-year-old from Chicago named Emmett Till. His murder was part of a wave of white terrorism in the wake of the 1954 Supreme Court decision that declared public school segregation unconstitutional. Only weeks later, Rosa Parks thought about young Emmett as she refused to move to the back of a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Five years later, Black students who called themselves \u201cthe Emmett Till generation\u201d launched sit-in campaigns that turned the struggle for civil rights into a mass movement. Till\u2019s lynching became the most notorious hate crime in American history.", "title": "The Blood of Emmett Till", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30753852-the-blood-of-emmett-till", "average": 4.22, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1474198979l/30753852.jpg", "reviews": 556, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1732.Timothy_B_Tyson", "name": "Timothy B.
