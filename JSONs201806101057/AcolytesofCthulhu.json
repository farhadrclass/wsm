Do you want to feel fear as you read short tales of the Elder Ones and their coming destruction of our planet? Do you want to further your knowledge of H.P.Lovecraft's seminal horror creation? If you answered yes to any of those questions, then my suggestion is to look somewhere else. \"Acolytes of Cthulhu\" is quite a disappointment when it comes to adding to the Lovecraft anthologies.I probably shouldn't complain that much, as I got this anthology for a measly sum of 5 bucks (thank you Barnes and Noble for your coupons and book exchange policy), but even then, I can't say it was a good $5 spent. The problem with \"Acolytes\" is that it suffers from the anthology curse. That is, it promises multiple stories centered around one subject, yet it fails to complete that promise. I get that sometimes it's hard to collect 20-25 short stories on things, but it CAN be done (look at Lockhart's \"Book of Cthulhu\" anthology to see what I mean). \"Acolytes of Cthulhu\" is a perfect example of a lofty goal that cannot be reached.Maybe, if the title had been different, I wouldn't feel as duped or as bummed out as I feel after finishing it. \"Acolyte\" is an assistant or follower of a person, place, or thing, right? And if they are followers of Cthulhu, you would expect the beast to feature prominently throughout the collected stories. Well, like me, you'd be wrong. Of the 28 stories here, only 3 (yes, 3) deal with Cthulhu. That is just about 10% of the 469 pages dedicated to the name plastered all over the cover. Instead, what we get are 25 other shorts about vampires, haunted houses, and demon children. I understand that most of these were influenced and inspired by H.P. Lovecraft (since the guy didn't stick to his mythos for his entire career), but why would an editor or publisher purposely mislead readers into thinking they were going to embark on a lengthy collection of Cthulhu related themes?Now, let's talk about the stories themselves. Maybe if they were good, I could look past the obvious lack of Cthulhu and still give this anthology a solid 3 star rating. Yet, these were also a general disappointment. Granted, most of them weren't especially bad (however Wellman's and Borges's were pretty awful as was \"The Final War\" by Keller), it's just that the majority of them weren't that good. I get that these are older, and were published many years ago, but that still doesn't change the fact that they were, for the most part, boring. They plodded along, moving slowly and far-too-gothicy, focusing more on melodrama and setting than actual substance. Again, I get these were written for the pulp press of the 30's and 40's, and readers views and abilities have changed, but there is nothing wrong with trying to find more modern and exciting stories to break up the monotony.I can say that there were 2 stories in here that really stood out as original and intriguing, and surprise, surprise, had NOTHING to do with Cthulhu. \"The Earth Brain\" by Edmond Hamilton was a nice twist on \"The Mountains of Madness\" and \"The Crib of Hell\" by Arthur Prendragon was a fun little story about deformed, evil offspring."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "From what I gather as I read this book, the authors who have contributed to this volume are all \"acolytes of Cthulhu,\" meaning (as Price notes in his introduction) that they all have in their own way paid tribute to Lovecraft through their writings, either in style or in content. And what a fine collection this is; probably one of the better horror samplers I've ever read. Of course, this is an anthology, but imho, there's only one story in here I'd single out as a \"how the hell did this get in here\" type thing. Other than that one (which shall remain nameless, although I'll bet if you're along for thrill of getting the willys, you'll know which one it is), the collection here is a mish-mosh of horror that you should definitely read alone and with the lights down low. For the first time, I can't pick a favorite, although \"The Earth Brain\" and \"The Will of Claude Ashur\" were 2 that really spooked me. If you are an HPL fan, not necessarily a Mythos fan since most of these stories do not directly address the Mythos, then you will enjoy this book. I wish people wrote like this nowadays -- the stories are gut-level creepy and don't have to depend on gore or slasher-type scenarios to be scary. I am very proud to have this book as a part of my HPL/Fedogan and Bremer collection. Highly recommended, even if you just want to read the stories for their horror benefit! If you're reading it and come across stories related to the Mythos and you aren't familiar with the names, drop everything and go to the source himself: Howard Phillips Lovecraft.contents list:Pierce, Earl -- Doom in the House of DuryeaBrennan, Joseph Payne -- The Seventh IncantationEddy, CM -- Black NoonRimel, Duane -- The Jewels of CharlotteWellman, Manly Wade -- The Letters of Cold FireHasse, Henry -- Horror at VecraTanner, Charles -- Out of the JarHamilton, Edmond -- The Earth-BrainPowers, Elwin G. -- Through the Alien AngleCausey, James -- Legacy in CrystalThompson, C.

Price, is a fantastic collection chock full of eerie, unsettling, and downright frightening stories examining the nature of humanity, the relationship between science and the occult, and the insignificant role humans play in the vast, unknowable universe. If you\u2019re a fan of cosmic or gothic horror, this will be a great collection for you, filled with lots of great stories written by notable authors who faithfully utilize the conventions of the genre that we know and love, as well as come up with their own modern storytelling conceits.However, something that I found incredibly disappointing was the following. Not only was there not a single female author included in this collection (nor many female characters of any importance), but also the especially bad stories (Legacy in Crystal, The Final War) were varnished with a thick layer of disgusting misogyny. Be better, Robert M. Price: collect stories that are diverse in voice and representation. I know for a fact that some of the best Lovecraft-inspired horror out there is written by women. So go find their work and include it in your future Lovecraft collections.My reviews of the individual short stories can be found in my reading progress, but my favorite stories in the collection were: From the Pits of Elder Blasphemy, The Letters of Cold Fire, Horror at Vecra, The Earth-Brain, The Will of Claude Ashur, The Crib of Hell, The Cellar Room, The Horror Out of Time, John Lehmann Alone, and Mists of Death.Review for the final story:Neil Gaiman\u2019s \u201cShoggoth\u2019s Old Peculiar\u201d is about an American tourist exploring the British seaside when he stumbles across an odd fishing village filled with strange and slightly disgruntled people. It\u2019s exactly the kind of fun, whimsical, referential silliness one would expect Gaiman to make of the Cthulu mythos. 4/5 stars."}, {"userName": "Gabriela Ventura", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8346149-gabriela-ventura", "userReview": "Ah, as antologias... nada contra, inclusive tenho amigos que organizam e escrevem para.

Price has managed to find a rich vein of stories derivative of Lovecraft (or sometimes Derleth who is a very different proposition) ranging from the 1930s through to the 1990s.Five are from the old Weird Tales stable and the stories tend (though only 'tend') to get better as the century proceeds and pulp becomes something closer to 'literature'. There are some duds (the dreadful Dr. David Keller's being most notable in this category) but the overall standard is pretty solid.A couple of 'sports' from the very young S. T. Joshi (almost a tribute to him) and from Neil Gaiman (which actually made me laugh out loud once or twice) add a bit of fun.The two 'high literary' contributions show Borges at his most elliptic and obscure and that Meyrink was capable of writing utter schlock, showing perhaps that Lovecraftian tales should be left to the experts.But once we put all this aside, Price has uncovered a number of writers who wrote little and one wishes had written more, notably Arthur Pendragon and Steffan B. Aletti in the 1960s.Perhaps they simply fell into the lean years between the pulps and the later rediscovery of Lovecraftian 'eldritch horrors' as a rich seam for popular culture and literary studies alike.The five stories by these two writers might be judged pastiches by some but the tone is almost perfect for the tradition, offering us rather fine throw-backs to the best of an earlier era.Of the generous helping of 29 tales, I would say that at least two thirds pass muster as stories and add value to the canon, which is way ahead of most such anthologies. Nearly all have some historical value.Definitely one for collectors of Lovecraftian material and those interested in the history of pulp horror fiction but perhaps not a book that we might expect to appear in the Times Literary Supplement."}, {"userName": "Steve Goble", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12886008-steve-goble", "userReview": "Possibly the best Lovecraftian anthology I have read.

All of the stories are not necessarily inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos, but in some way, shape or form inspired by Lovecraft himself. I did enjoy the fact that the stories were from the 1940s to present, as this leant to the authenticity of the 'acolytes.'

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39512822-ian-casey", "userReview": "My second experience of the world of Cthulhu anthologies, Acolytes of Cthulhu is apparently one of the better known ones on the market. It certainly gives the impression of a high-effort affair, with a wide array of works spanning the 1930s through to 1990s having been ferretted out for re-publication. If Robert M. Price\u2019s introduction is to be believed, some were obscure to the point of being almost completely forgotten.With more than twenty authors across such an expanse of time, this book will necessarily be hit-and-miss as to one\u2019s individual taste. For the most part I found the stories rather by-the-numbers. Oh look, someone\u2019s found a sinister old grimoire. And now they\u2019ve conducted an occult ceremony. And now there\u2019s a monster and/or portal to another dimension. Colour me shocked.Admittedly that\u2019s to be expected in a collection of deliberately derivative works, but I read this kind of stuff in the hope that someone can bring a unique spark of imagination to the Cthulhu Mythos. And while nothing here blew me away, there are stories I appreciated for playing with some cool ideas.The first story, \u2018Doom of the House of Duryea\u2019 by Earl Price Jr (1936), briefly and cleverly explores an elaborate version of vampirism. \u2018The Final War\u2019 by David H. Keller MD (1949) gives a fleeting and entertaining glimpse of Cthulhu if he/she/it had been a bad-ass shape-shifting interplanetary warlord-wizard-emperor bent on conquering Earth. It\u2019s so preposterous as to be breathtaking.Perhaps my favourite story was the longest and the closest to emulating Lovecraft\u2019s style. C. Hall Thompson\u2019s \u2018The Will of Claude Ashur\u2019 (1947) is packed with that same brand of deliciously awful melodramatic prose in its story of an evil man committing thoroughly malevolent and supernatural acts. And of course there\u2019s a beautiful woman embodying all that\u2019s pure and wonderful in the world and who has no agency of her own. Were it not such an ingrained trope I would be offended by it.\u2018The Earth Brain\u2019 by Edmond Hamilton (1932) tries something a bit more \u2018out there\u2019, experimenting with the concept of the earth as a living creature \u2013 and a potentially murderous one at that. Two stories by Arthur Pendragon and three from Steffan B. Aletti from the 1960s are among the most competent here, demonstrating that this style was still alive in an era not often associated with it. Aletti leans a little more towards Howard than Lovecraft I think.The world\u2019s most self-promoting supernatural fiction scholar S.T. Joshi makes a rare appearance as an author in \u2018The Recurring Doom\u2019 (1980), demonstrating why he\u2019s better suited to writing about this stuff than writing it. Neil Gaiman provides an amusing capstone to the collection with \u2018Shoggoth\u2019s Old Peculiar\u2019 (1998), being a sort of humorous tribute to Lovecraft whilst still managing to be a well-executed supernatural tale in its own right.For what it is, Acolytes of Cthulhu is solid and if this is your jam then it\u2019s worthy of your time. Just don\u2019t expect anything in it to beat Lovecraft at his own game."}, {"userName": "Keira", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30714510-keira", "userReview": "[cw: racism]I'm beginning to amass a large collection of Cthulhu and Lovecraft related books (e.g. Black Wings of Cthulhu: Tales of Lovecraftian Horror, Shadows over Innsmouth, The Madness of Cthulhu Anthology and more).What I loved about this anthology is how they link together some of the Lovecraft mythos. Unfortunately, I don't think that they really expanded on previous stories as much as The Madness of Cthulhu Anthology did, which I really liked. They were unique horror stories though, and I love them for their macabre nature. Some were pretty hard to get through because they were written in a strange way, or were simply not as interesting to me. But there were some really interesting ones in there. Definitely worth a look if you're a Lovecraft/Cthulhu fan.They did use some racist terminology and have some racism in them, much like Lovecraft's original stories. I was sorely disappointed by this. I was also disappointed that no one thought to do a different spin and maybe have a main character who wasn't a (presumably as it's not stated otherwise) cis white man who was rich and 'educated' (although there was one that I recall where he wasn't as 'educated'). I shan't hold my breath for such a story, but I don't think I'll ever kill the little spark of hope that resides within my heart."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1971064-john", "userReview": "I knew what I was getting into when I started this so I knew that most of the twenty-odd stories in this collection were pastiche. I don't mind a good Lovecraft pastiche but many of the stories in this book remind me why pastiche is generally a pejorative term. What I have discovered over the years is that the closer one tries to imitate the less genuine and compelling the story is. Many of the stories here just try way too hard. When the writer takes the source and then plays with it and makes it his own the results are far more enjoyable. With that in mind, there are some real gems in this collection. 'The Horror at Vecra' is a solid story in the vein of 'Dunwich Horror' while 'The Dunstable Horror' not only recalls the HPL story but brings I'm some clear influences from Algernon Blackwood, especially in the ending. Stories like 'Mythos' by John Glasby, 'John Lehman Alone' by David Kaufman 'Necrotic Knowledge' by Dirk Mosig and 'There are More Things' by Jorge Luis Borges take the collection out of pure pastiche and present more original takes on Lovecraft's style. The real surprise here was a story by S.T. Joshi 'The Recurring Doom'. Joshi takes us on an HPL style investigation that quickly turns into a Robert E Howard pulp adventure romp. To be fair I enjoyed most of the collection and while there were more than a couple groan worthy moments, and one face-palm of an ending, I would recommend this to HPL aficionados."}, {"userName": "JManInPhoenix", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50694278-jmaninphoenix", "userReview": "Mixed bag of short stories.
