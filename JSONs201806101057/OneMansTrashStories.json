The stories in this collection, One Man's Trash are sublime. There wasn't a single one that I thought wasn't worth publication, wasn't worth reading. I enjoyed them all. I remember being a tween and having Ivan come and do a school reading for us. One story that stood out over the years was \"It Doesn't Hurt,\" which details the notorious comb-ball sport, reminding me so vividly of something my brother and I did. Coyote hits the nail of childhood nostalgia on the head. My first taste of Ivan Coyote's story-telling at a young age prepared me for the excellent craft I am now encountering as a young woman. The only reason this misses out on five stars is because I didn't like the order of the pieces. The \"There\" section was much weaker to me than the \"Then\" and \"Now\" sections. Ending on a weaker note definitely left me feeling it wasn't perfect, whereas if it had led with the weaker stories, I might have felt differently. However, this has more hard hitters than in Close to Spider-Man though I'd recommend both. Seriously, do yourself a favour and read something by Ivan Coyote.My favourite's from this collection:\"It Doesn't Hurt\"\"Just Reward\"\"Mavis for Prime Minister\"\"The Safe Way\"\"Makeover\"\"More Beautiful\""}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13639920-erin", "userReview": "I\u2019ve written many times before about Ivan E Coyote and how very very good her stories are (they are very very good). I recently made my way though this collection as a set of nighttime reads. You know how usually you can only manage four or five pages in bed before falling asleep? Well this collection is perfect because no story clocks in at more than six or seven, each one is a contained little gem and you go to bed satisfied that you\u2019ve explored something rich and deep without having to dive too far. I suppose it\u2019s like wading to your ankles in the time it takes, but still discovering a submerged treasure. The subject matter is quotidian, the narration a matter of fact first person, and yet it somehow manages (and I suppose it should be my task here to figure out that \u201csomehow\u201d and explain it, but like watching a magician, I\u2019d rather not look too closely at Coyote\u2019s magic for fear of having the whole thing spoiled) to unsettle/resettle the taken-for-granted. Magical!"}, {"userName": "Zoom", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1989201-zoom", "userReview": "I love Ivan Coyote - in person, in books, in theory, in practice, everything. She's a storyteller with a million stories, because he has a facility for finding the story in the most mundane encounters and events. His stories tend to be plotless yet meaningful, and she shares with us her eye for detail, her ear for the things that often go unsaid, and her voice, rich with humour and insight. He also shares the tongue in his cheek and the twinkle in her eye, both of which are essential Ivan."}, {"userName": "Jocelynn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6879026-jocelynn", "userReview": "I enjoyed the stories as always, not as much as \"The Slow Fix\" or \"Missed Her\" but still I enjoyed the stories. :)"}, {"userName": "Roxanne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172503-roxanne", "userReview": "I am currently in love with Ivan E.

I love their voice that shows through in all of their stories, the way they feel so familiar and kind, and how genuine they come across.I will say that this is not my favourite of Ivan's short story collections, I personally prefer Missed Her and Tomboy Survival Guide because they invoked in me a deeper sense of community as a queer person and are a little more honed in their style, but it was still a wonderful read. As one of their earlier collections, the stories are more focused on how Ivan grew up in a general sense and experiences as a younger person exploring Vancouver. It's hard to pinpoint how it's different but it definitely is. I appreciated this book both for the stories and the context it gives to appreciating Ivan's later work."}, {"userName": "Sarah JC", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77103012-sarah-jc", "userReview": "Hear Ivan Coyote tell these stories live.

I thought to myself, if Ivan can continue to write this well then I'm going to be very impressed by this book. While the book did not deliver the same level of quality as the first story, the other stories were still engaging, funny and unique. That being said, I have to add that the bulk of the stories were vignettes and as such left me feeling unsatisfied. I kept thinking, 'That's it?' The book runs 136 pages with 18 stories. However, the book doesn't start til page 13 and has 15 blank pages scattered throughout, so it's actually 108 pages long. That leaves an average of 6 pages per story. Now, 6 pages could be ample, but each page in this book is surrounded by generous margins. It reminds me of when I was in high school and trying to pass off my term paper with enormous amounts of white space on all sides, just so I could meet the page minimum. All this is to say that these were very short stories. Part of me liked that. I liked flying through this book in no time. It was no slog. The only problem was it left me feeling that the author needed to do more with these stories to make them truly compelling instead of simply amusing. Clearly Ivan Coyote has talent, an engaging writing style and has no trouble offering up amusing character observations for her realistic and offbeat cast. Because of that, I will be reading more from him and his gender-bending point of view."}, {"userName": "Shawn Bird", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5992093-shawn-bird", "userReview": "(When I met Ivan at Word on the Lake Writers' Festival I asked what pronoun to use and was told \"they\" so I have used it in this review).In person, Ivan weaves stories around a room, and entwines the audience in a common sympathetic adventure, one that leads to tears, laughter, and sighs. I can hear Ivan's voice as I read these stories: the relaxed,winding tone of a story-teller who plays with the audience with self-deprecating observations. By the end insight shines.Ivan is a lesbian who identifies as a male. These stories include amusing, awkward moments of their life, and I appreciate the little windows on a life that offers moments of pathos and delight. (See \"Fear and Hoping in Las Vegas\")The stories are accessible, entertaining, and thought-provoking. I enjoyed the whole collection."}, {"userName": "Jimmie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1072523-jimmie", "userReview": "I love Coyote's stories. They're so genuine and...\"cozy\" is the only word I can think of. They're not essays or humor; it's not like David Sedaris, which is what I first expected. They're just stories. They're the short snippets of life you expect to hear from friends while you're sitting in a bar, nursing a beer, waiting for a storm to pass. They're the stuff of life, not always grand but always important.And for gawd's sake, that last story, [SPOILER coming] when Coyote and her girlfriend go to Vegas to elope--that story alone would be worth triple the price of the book."}, {"userName": "Knitography", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2493226-knitography", "userReview": "My first introduction to Ivan Coyote was an interview she did recently on the CBC; her thoughtful and articulate answers made me want to run straight to the library to pick up one of her books, and I'm glad I did!Her writing is outstanding - each story a self-contained gem, distilled down to its essence. Her work is streamlined and uncluttered, and each story gives you a moment, an insight into human nature and human relationships.

The talent evident in that first collection is confirmed with One Man\u2019s Trash, a series of connected stories about being queer, searching out new frontiers, and being on the road.The characters in One Man\u2019s Trash make evident the child in all of us, when heroes and superheroes won the day.Including the hilarious account of an attempted lesbian wedding in a Las Vegas chapel, and a touching tale of being beguiled by an uncle\u2019s independent-minded girlfriend, these are stories about being on the road: to the northern tundra or the southern desert, through cities and towns, on horses, in trucks and vans, with friends, family, and lovers. In achingly personal tones, Ivan Coyote paints beautiful and honest portraits of life, the road, and the spirits within.Praise for Close to Spider Man:\"Blissfully rich . . . [a] thoroughly entertaining . . . surefooted, humorous take on misfit love and familial solidarity.\"\u2014Publishers Weekly\"Coyote\u2019s debut short story collection is powerful. . . . These stories consistently detail the pain of being mis-understood, of living and trying to love where one doesn\u2019t fit in, and doesn\u2019t want to.
