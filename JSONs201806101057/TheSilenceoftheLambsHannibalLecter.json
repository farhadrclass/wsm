Thank you for your understanding.4.0 to 4.5 stars. Another one of those terrific situations where I saw the movie first (and loved it) and then eventually decided to read the book... and loved it too. Score!!! Now assuming that most people not suffering from the after-effects of severe head trauma know the basic plot concerning FBI trainee \u201cHello...Clariiiiiice\u201d Starling, while trying to kibosh a Psychotic Vera Wang wannabe named Buffalo Bill, starts an unconventional relationship with extreme culinary expert Dr. Hannibalicious Lecter, I thought I would give you my take on the whole movie wins/book wins debate. Please note that I am going to feel completely free to drop spoilers without warning from here on out so....recognize. \nMOVIE GLORY\n1. First, I thought the movie\u2019s treatment of Starling\u2019s time on the Sheep and Horse farm was much better, probably in large part due to Jodie Foster really nailing the angst factor as she describes trying to save a spring lamb from slaughter (in the book it was horses being slaughtered that she was tripping about). Here the movie wins and I can still close my eyes and here Foster/Starling saying \u201cthe lambs were screaming\u201d and \u201cit was cold, so cold.\u201d She made that scene her chew toy and it is a wonderful example of taking more and condensing it into a more powerful less. 2. The End of the movie, Lecter stalking Dr. Chilton and ending his phone conversation with Starling by saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to have an old friend for dinner.\u201d YUM!!! One of my favorite lines/ideas from the movie and I was very bitter that it did not have an analog in the book. The Booest of Hoos on that. AND SURPRISINGLY...that is it for the movies clear superiority. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved the movie and think they did much EXCEPTIONALLY well. However, I was shocked in reading the book that most the best parts in the movie (including Lecter, which shocked me) were handled equally effectively in the book. Thus, where I think it was a tie or too close to call, I have decided not to put it in one camp or another. With that said....on to the book. \nBOOK DOMINANCE\n1. Need to start with Lector and this is a surprise because Sir Anthony made this role his like few people on movie history. However, I am not talking about what was in both the movie and the book as I think it is a push, to a slight edge to Mr. Hopkins. No, I am talking about the one AMAZING insight the book provides to the character. Namely, Lecter\u2019s motivation is about \u201camusing himself.\u201d This single thread running through the book makes Lecter a far darker, far more sinister character (which also explains why hollywood downplayed it to land Hopkins in the role). Walking away from the book, the reader has a much better sense of Lector as a conscience-lacking entity of pure evil, than we get from the movie. Kudos to Mr. Harris on that point. 2. As good as Scott Glenn is in the movie, his character found way too much time on the editing room floor and the book truly develops well. His scene with the head of John Hopkins university is one that truly should have found a way on screen as I thought it was perfect.3. James Gumb (aka Buffalo Bill). As wonderfully icky as Ted Levine is in the movie, he comes across as just a nutso on screen with the naked \u201ctuck\u201d dance an the lotion commercials. Meanwhile, in lit land, Gumby is shown to be so....SAVAGE and calculating that all of the nutso stuff takes on a far more sinister aspect. I was deeply disturbed by the depiction of Gumb\u2019s craft skills and the movie never hammered that home enough. \nPUTTING IT IN THE NUT\u2019S SHELL\u2019S\nOverall, I was deeply impressed with both the movie and book, but the book really gets the gold star for being able to work with my love of the movie and still blow me away. In closing, if you have only seen the movie, you should read the book and if you have only read the book, you should see the movie as it is deeply respectful of the source material. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!P.S. I listened to the audio version read by Frank Muller and he was his usual perfection. P.P.S. I was fairly insulted that the movie makers felt the need to change Amarone to Chianti (in the famous fava beans scene) presumably because they didn't think the \"audience\" would get it. OUCH!!"}, {"userName": "Martine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/381149-martine", "userReview": "Call me a freak, but I have a bit of a crush on Hannibal Lecter. He may be the scariest fuck out there (certainly scarier than the supposed monster of the book, Buffalo Bill), but he just oozes style and knowledge. In fact, he has so much style and knowledge that he doesn't come off as a ridiculous prick when he says things like, 'A census taker tried to quantify me once. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a big Amarone'* or 'Can you smell his sweat? That peculiar goatish odour is trans-3-methyl-2 hexenoic acid. Remember it, it's the smell of schizophrenia.' Quite the contrary -- he sounds cool saying these things. Sophisticated, even. In this and many other ways, Dr Lecter is so utterly fascinating that you'll still find yourself rooting for him after he has committed several heinous (but brilliant!) murders, hoping he'll stay out of the hands of the police and live out his life in freedom. Now that's quality writing for you.As you can probably tell from the above, I like The Silence of the Lambs, which is to say the book on which the movie was based. Except for the fact that Harris makes Clarice rather stupid** and that the dialogue in the book is a bit too clever and masculine for its own good***, it's a solid and exciting will-they-find-him-in-time-to-save-the-girl story -- a page-turner if ever there was one. The characters aren't terribly easy to identify with, but that's all right, because for one thing, they're cool (had I mentioned that yet?), and for another, they all have a clearly defined quest. They don't necessarily have the same quest, but hey, that only serves to increase the tension.In some regards the book is better than the film. Remember those stupid anagrams from the movie? They're not in the book (except for the bilirubin one, which I actually quite like). The book makes its connections in a much more logical, less what-the-fuck?-ish way. It also has a more realistic romance, though not necessarily a better one. On the down side, I think Thomas Harris must have kicked himself for not having come up with the closing line of the film ('I'm having an old friend for dinner') himself. In my opinion, it's the best closing line in cinematic history, unmatched by the ending of the book. Still, it's a satisfying read. Very satisfying. As satisfying as the movie, and that's saying a fair bit.......................* Yes, that's what he says in the book. Not 'a nice Chianti'. I've been reliably informed by those in the know (I myself do not actually drink wine) that Amarone and Chianti are not in fact the same thing. 'Chianti' does sound better than 'Amarone' in this line, doesn't it?** In the book, Dr Lecter tells Clarice in one of their first interviews that Billy has kidnapped large-chested Catherine Martin because 'he wants a vest with tits on it'. He then goes on to say in their next meeting that 'Billy is making a girl suit out of real girls'. And despite these incredibly obvious clues (which cannot be rude jokes on Lecter's part as he's far too sophisticated to make such rude jokes) it takes Clarice, who is supposed to be really intelligent, the entire rest of the book to figure out what it is that Billy wants from his victims. They wisely changed that in the movie, where Clarice doesn't have her entire quest spelled out for her right at the beginning.*** I've never met any women who speak to each other the way Clarice and Ardelia do. Then again, I've never met any brilliant FBI trainees, so what do I know? Perhaps they do speak to each other like that at Quantico. I guess I'll never find out.

A game changer indeed that swept away with the 5 most respected awards by the Academy (best film, best script, best director, best actor and best actress) that you can't diminish since this particular combination of these 5 Oscars, had been only accomplished three times in the history of the Oscars, It Happened One Night (1934) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), along with the said film.A curious thing is that while Dr. Hannibal Lecter became the lead character of the book series generating adaptations of each book along with a TV series inspired in the said character......for me, my attachment to Silence of the Lambs was the young FBI trainee Clarice Starling, since she was a formidable character facing overwhelming challenges: dealing with disturbing interviews with the insidious Dr. Hannibal Lecter, an unwilling pawn of FBI Special Agent Jack Crawford, and having to face the insanely dangerous \"Buffalo Bill\".Clarice Starling is a beacon of light in the middle of a hopeless world of darkness. She is smart, intuitive, resourceful and brave.\nTHE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS...\nHardly, anyone thinks himself as the villain, each character (real or fiction) thinks that they are doing the right thing and that the end justifies the means......and young FBI trainee Clarice Starling is \"the means\" for Special Agent Jack Crawford to get the insight of Dr. Hannibal Lecter about the case of the criminally insane one known as \"Buffalo Bill\", so exposing an unexperienced Starling to the wicked cunning Dr. Hannibal Lecter, is justified if that can accomplish the arrest of the wanted serial killer.This kind of \"justified manipulation\" isn't strange to Crawford since he has done it before with Special Investigator Will Graham, that not matter his natural talent to get to know how the serial killers think, Graham was already a fragile character looking for peace of mind when he was \"persuaded\" to become involved once again in a serial killer case and getting inside the world of Dr. Hannibal Lecter again with disastrous outcome.Now, it's turn for young Clarice to become a \"pawn\" of Jack Crawford that while his intentions are \"good\" in the angle that he genuinely wants to arrest criminals, he's leaving collateral damage in the path of those manhunting crusades.Clarice may not fall now......but she's already in the watch of Dr. Hannibal Lecter and it was Crawford who put her there.\nSERIAL KILLERS' WORLD IS SO SMALL\nIt seems that the serial killers world, at least in the literary universe created by Thomas Harris, is so small that a character like Dr. Hannibal Lecter, where you have to take in mind that he was a renown psychiatrist too, well, it isn't that hard to notice the particular M.O.s of each criminally insane murderers, and soon enough knowing who in the middle of that twisted club is the designer on each killing spree.And Dr. Lecter knows that.He knows that he is a necessary evil for being able by the forces of the law to catch other menaces of this same kind of wicked breed,And of course, Dr. Lecter has a plan.He is patient. There is not hurry.He already got his payback to his accidental captor.Now, it could be good to get his freedom back.Since after all, the world is just too boring without him there.And that fool Jack Crawford keeps sending him the tools to get what he wants.Dr. Hannibal Lecter is ready to eat the whole world once again.Be afraid.Be very afraid......and turn to look if somebody is following you, ready to take you for dinner."}, {"userName": "Councillor", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40792319-councillor", "userReview": "\u201cI ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.\"\n(Or, \"a big amarone\" as in the novel.)Thomas Harris's story of \"The Silence of the Lambs\" has always been a fascinating one for me, and I believe wholeheartedly that this is one of the most unique, most fascinating and most enthralling crime novels ever written (and rarely has any mystery/thriller been adapted to film so successfully). The 1991 film is one of my favorite films of all time, even though much of the praise must belong to Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, both of whom commited dedicated and convincing performances to Jonathan Demme's adaptation.It has been more than half a year since I finally read this novel, but I don't think anything has had a similar impact on me ever since finishing the book. In general, one of the biggest problems I have with crime novels is that it is so easy for them to become procedural, to feel as if they were written according to a guide on how to write a crime novel. I have a lot of trouble relating to many of these novels, and even if the mystery is intriguing and keeps you turning the pages, it often comes at a disadvantages as characters, especially investigating ones, are in constant danger of remaining too shallow, too detached for the reader to really care about what ultimately happens to them. In Thomas Harris' novel, however, we have Clarice Starling, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, Jack Crawford, Dr. Frederick Chilton, Buffalo Bill - all of them iconic and unforgettable characters in their own right. They become real persons between the binding holding together this book, and that's something many crime authors should always keep in mind while writing their novels, at least in my opinion.Of course, it's hard to judge this book on its own. Stories surrounding Hannibal Lecter have been covered through five films (Manhunter, The Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon, Hannibal and Hannibal Rising) and a very successful three-season TV series, and everyone has formed a different mindset about Hannibal. We may see him in the form of Brian Cox from Manhunter, Mads Mikkelsen from the TV series or Gaspard Ulliel from Hannibal Rising, but undoubtedly the man who shaped this character and made him the icon he is nowadays was Anthony Hopkins, so much that the American Film Institute even selected him as the Number One Villain of All Time. Reading a novel after seeing one or even several treatments of the source material by filmmakers has always been quite a challenge for me, as it generally became quite difficult to see the book in its own right without being overruled by images from the adaptations which have burned themselves into my mind, but in the case of Thomas Harris' novel, for me it just added to the pleasure of getting to know these characters and their unique fates.You may have realized that I don't even know what to write about the book anymore, to an extent that I started rambling about the different actors who portrayed this iconic character. That's simply because it left me speechless, even now, quite a long time after watching the movie and the TV show and just a few months after reading the novel. There is no doubt I will read \"Red Dragon\" and \"Hannibal\" as well (they are already resting on my shelves): just as there is no doubt that I can only assure everyone who hasn't read this yet that \"The Silence of the Lambs\" is the crime/thriller/mystery novel you were waiting for."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "\u200eThe Silence of the lambs (Hannibal Lecter #2), Thomas Harris (1940)The Silence of the Lambs is a novel by Thomas Harris.

Both novels feature the cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter, this time pitted against FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling.

reading this, whats put me off is that the movie has been played on the TV so many times now Clarice and Lecter are quite vivid in my mind. I am sure the book has lot more to offer as Harris is one of my high ranking thriller writers.Some trivia on the movie...Like \"Casablanca\", this movie contains a famous misquoted line: most people quote Lecter's famous \"Good evening, Clarice\" as \"Hello, Clarice.\" This is not a misquote from the first movie but an actual quote from the sequel Hannibal. In Hannibal, when Dr. Lecter and Clarice (now played by Julianne Moore) speak on the phone for the first time, he does in fact say \"Hello Clarice\". This is the origin for the correctly quoted movie line.Buffalo Bill is the combination of three real life serial killers: Ed Gein, who skinned his victims; Ted Bundy, who used the cast on his hand as bait to make women get into his van; and Gary Heidnick, who kept women he kidnapped in a pit in his basement. Gein was only positively linked to two murders and suspected of two others. He gathered most of his materials not through murder, but grave-robbing. In the popular imagination, however, he remains a serial killer with uncounted victims."}, {"userName": "Edward Lorn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8850418-edward-lorn", "userReview": "Retro review time!Loved the movie, so I read the book. Liked the book enough to look into other Thomas Harris books. Read Red Dragon. Fucking loved it. And then it was all downhill after that. Hannibal was okay. Never read Hannibal Rising, and it still holds zero draw for me.What I remember the most about Silence of the Lambs is Clarice catching some spunk to the eye. That, above all else, is my most striking memory from this book. What's worse than a surprise money shot? A surprise money shot from a psycho. Bleck! The ending is probably the best part. Nerve-shattering fun.Thomas Harris is so good he takes seven years to write a book. Donna Tartt and Marisha Pessl do the same. Stephen King said in On Writing that he (the next quote is paraphrased) couldn't understand why someone would only do something every seven years when they were so damn good at it. This has no bearing on this book, but I like purposeless trivia, so there you have it.In summation: I figured I'd go back and review all these titles I read before I joined Goodreads (or before Goodreads even existed) because I wanna.

I'd read this book back in High School and I like it but it didn't have real impact. Sometimes you have to read something more than once or be in a particular frame of mind. Upon my second reading of this book I loved it. Maybe its because I'm older or maybe its because I'm reading the series in order. I liked this book more than Red Dragon and I really liked that one. I still prefer Will Graham to Clarice Starling and I need more background on Jack Crawford. Maybe I'll get more Jack Crawford in the next book Hannibal. I'd say the main reason reason I liked this book more than Red Dragon was simple Dr. Hannibal Lecter. In Red Dragon he was a scene stealing B-Character but in this book he gets bumped up to second lead. Dr. Lecter is maybe in a 1/3 of the book but he makes his presence felt on every page. I have to admit I don't really get Buffalo Bill, I find him hilarious and I couldn't stop saying \"It puts the lotion in the basket\" a phrase from the movie not the book. I don't know if I need to recommend this book. I think everyone has heard of the movie and either you're interested or not.

Typhoid and swans - it all comes from the same place.\"- Hannibal LecterThere always lies a certain degree of tragedy in reading the source material after having seen (multiple times) its expertly executed film adaptation. Besides the revelation of the plot, the resulting contamination makes it mighty difficult to come up with one's own, unique interpretations of the characters. It slightly spoils the reading experience, since the element of surprise, the freshness is all but gone. This is especially true for Thomas Harris' Silence of the Lambs, with its now iconic portrayals of Clarice Starling and Hannibal \"the Cannibal\" Lecter. As a thriller, it is by definition very much plot driven. For this reason, reading the book became more of a clinical procedure to me, trying to detect where there is a deviation in dialogue, which scenes were cut/expanded, which characters were more or less fleshed out, etc.. The viscerality which a novel of this type often aims to provoke, wasn't quite there as a result. I see why it's a very well-written thriller, but the emotional response just never quite managed to materialize.There was however a theme I spotted in this, which I strangely didn't pick up on before. After thinking it through, I found it's really a tale about parentship. More specifically, about which of the primary (almost archetypal) males in Starling's life at that time can claim her (an orphan) as his, which one has influenced, moulded her the most.First there is Crawford, the respectable, protective mentor figure, who tries to guide her through the pitfalls of her fledgling career in the FBI. Then we have Chilton. A rather sleazy, intellectually inferior asylum ward, who makes thinly veiled sexual advances towards Starling, and doesn't quite respect her in an official capacity. And finally, the fiendish Lecter, who seeks to corrupt (metaphorically devirginize?) her, to impart to her an esoteric knowledge about the inescapable darkness of the world and the human psyche. The dialogues between him and Starling are for that reason alone utterly fantastic. If this was my first encounter with Harris' world and characters, it most definitely would have been awarded a four or even five star rating. It truly is a great piece of crime thriller writing, and deserves all its praise. Unfortunately, it suffers from my early, intense exposure to the film adaptation, bringing the rating down a notch."}, {"userName": "Book Riot Community", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community", "userReview": "I re-watched the movie early this month and decided to take a look at the book that spawned what is possible the most perfect crime movie of all time.

That 1991 multi-Oscar winning movie starring Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal \"The Cannibal\" Lectern and Jodie Foster as FBI Agent Trainee Clarice Starling. With English not as my major tongue, dialogs can easily escape me while watching the movie. But not when I am holding and reading the book. I savor and marvel at each word in the scene that I really like while recalling the movie. Sometimes, after reading the book, I buy a copy of the movie and hear those dialogs again. Oh the magic of words! The brilliance of the writer!Thomas Harris (born 1940), American, is known for his Hannibal Lectern series and The Silence of the Lambs is its most popular piece. According to Wiki, Harris is elusive so little is known about himself except that he calls up his mother everyday, wherever he is, to discuss his works and other stuff. He married a fellow student so I think and pray that his male characters, Dr. Lectern or the serial killer on the loose, Buffalo Bill (who skins his prey, mostly fat smooth-skinned women, that explains the name) are not based on himself.I wonder how Harris could have thought of those conversations between a Virginia psychology graduate with honors, Starling and well-known psychiatrist Dr. Lectern. A psychologist and a psychiatrist in a dark solitary confinement. A young woman and a middle-age man. A trainee and a veteran. Like a lion and a gazelle.

It deserves every glowing word it has ever received and is well-nigh perfect in its composition and execution.

The film adaptation starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins is one of my favourite films of all time, and so I was already familiar with the storyline, but that didn't stop me becoming absolutely hooked with this novel.Harris's prose is incredibly readable, even more so I would say in this particular book - unlike Red Dragon, I didn't have any issues getting used to the writing style and the characters with this one. This is probably because I've now already read one Harris book, and also because I was already familiar with Jack Crawford (from the previous book) and had prior knowledge of Clarice Starling from the film. I also found that this book was much faster in its pacing than its predecessor, and there was less exposition as a result. Within around 10 chapters we were already at an autopsy, and I loved seeing the investigation into Buffalo Bill and his victims unfold through Clarice's eyes. Not only was it great reading about a female protagonist, but it was great to have those lighter moments throughout the novel when Clarice interacts with another female friend who she is studying and living with.I also much prefer the antagonist of this book, Jame Gumb/Buffalo Bill, to Francis Dolarhyde from Red Dragon. Although Dolarhyde was an interesting character to read about, and we did get a lot more from him, I find Gumb to be a far more bizarre and fascinating serial killer to read about. The comparisons that can be drawn between Gumb and other real-life serial killers like Ed Gein is incredibly fascinating to me, and the kills are a great deal more theatrical - maybe not great for those with a weak stomach, but much more interesting to read about for me.I will say that Harris's writing is great up until the conclusions - in the same way that the ending to Red Dragon was rushed and a little anticlimactic, this one felt a bit like that too. Although I can't fault it too much for this - it's definitely not as easy to build tension on a page as it is in a movie with the help of visuals and music, but at the same time, the book winds up quite quickly and not as well as I felt it was portrayed in the movie. The ending however does slightly more satisfying closing chapters than the previous book, especially in relation to certain characters, which is fun to read.I think I prefer this book mainly because I prefer Clarice Starling as a protagonist to Will Graham. I also love that we see a lot more of Hannibal Lecter himself in this book, and he feels like much more of a central character than just a creepy, interesting aside. I look forward to getting my hands on Hannibal, where I can spend a lot more time with his character and hopefully delve deeper into his psyche as he's a brilliant creation. Overall though, Silence of the Lambs was a thoroughly entertaining and fast-paced read, and one I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of crime fiction, whether you've seen the film or not."}, {"userName": "Willow ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4529669-willow", "userReview": "OMG I loved this book! What is wrong with me? LolI really did though. What can I say? Yes, it\u2019s grim and grisly. Harris likes to go into creepy detail about skinning people, disturbing bugs, and the ickiness of finding a severed head in a jar. It\u2019s not gore galore though. It more disturbing than a gross, and that\u2019s why I liked it. Buffalo Bill is making this gruesome outfit and he thinks about it like he\u2019s some kind of runway designer. It\u2019s kind of oddly and darkly funny.I had forgotten a lot of the movie, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really fair to say I liked the book better than the movie, but I did. A few months, ago I read Red Dragon, and it didn\u2019t capture my imagination half as much as this one. The tension that is in \u2018Silence of the Lambs\u2019 is not in Red Dragon\u2026at least not for me. I think a lot of it stems from the fact that Harris didn\u2019t really like Will Graham. In fact he made him kind of an ass, and I suspect Will meets a grim fate because of it. Harris adored Clarice though, and I\u2019m thrilled that he felt that way about her, because he made Clarice wonderfully strong, resilient, and noble. I liked her a lot. I read a review that actually dissed this book because of that, saying that every guy had the hots for Clarice, but that simply isn\u2019t true. Jack Crawford just admires her work and suspects Hannibal may talk to her. A police officer makes a rude comment hinting that she\u2019s stuck up. And Clinton is downright menacing to her. You definitely get the feeling though that Clarice is stunning. She almost has to be for someone like Hannibal to turn his attention toward her. One of the big differences between the movie and the book is that Hannibal is younger. And while it\u2019s never stated, you feel like Clarice might be attracted to Hannibal as much as he is to her, despite the fact that he scares the snot out of her. In the movie, Anthony Hopkins was creepy and menacing. But in the book, Hannibal has this strange sexy allure. I know you probably think I\u2019m nuts. But I swear it\u2019s there. The scary sexual tension in this book is off the charts. All of a sudden the events in Hannibal (the 3rd book) make way more sense to me. Of course, Lecter will eventually go after Clarice, and of course he will win her. It\u2019s been set-up in \u2018Silence of the Lambs.\u2019This creepy romance made me ponder why I would ever be attracted to a evil character like Lecter. I admit, a lot of it has to do with my swoony admiration of Mads Mikkelsen, but there is more to that. Clarice has an advantage in this book, because she has Lecter on her side. That\u2019s a strange power, like having a tiger by the tail. Lecter sort of becomes her malevolent guardian angel. While in real life, this would be some serious scary shit, in the literary world, it\u2019s a dark fantasy. I think that\u2019s why \u2018Silence of the Lambs\u2019 affected me the way it did. I got caught up in this dark pull.It\u2019s okay you can call me a fruitcake. I understand. lolAnyway, I will definitely being reading \u2018Hannibal\u2019 now. I must see how this dark fantasy romance ends. lololBuddy read with Sony! :D"}, {"userName": "Pablo Aguirre", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53257098-pablo-aguirre", "userReview": "Excelente estructura atrapante para mostrar esta historia de crimen psicol\u00f3gico"}, {"userName": "Erin \u2615 *Proud Book Hoarder*", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3048260-erin-proud-book-hoarder", "userReview": "Another re-read of Silence of the Lambs, this time my favorite. Maybe it's because I'm more into the story and read them in the order of sequence and not popularity, I'm not sure, but this time around I found it even more fascinating than the first meet.Clarice is a likeable character. Her background melding with who she wants to be is an admirable one. She's given the chance of a lifetime, handed out by a man she admires, to step her foot firmly into the FBI. Without meaning to, she's sucked into the world of Hannibal Lecter, who spurs her on to uncover clues and solve the mystery of the serial killer the media calls Buffalo Bill. Her determination mixed with fragile ego was a realistic blend, and her internal backward insults when talking to people who don't give her enough credit was downright amusing.The character of Hannibal Lecter is larger than life, written so well on the pages I can see him clearly as the writer takes him through the motions. With class and culture, manners but enjoying cruelty with his words, the madman is interesting as he both torments Clarice and forces her to self-reveal. The heart of the book is their verbal warplay, the cautious pauses on her behalf, the strategic maneuvering on his.I'm surprised how much I felt for Crawford in this one; I think before he fell in the shadows and I didn't pay as much notice. He's an intriguing character from his haunting moments with his ailing wife, his detached involvement with Hannibal, to his almost paternal bond of Clarice.As a serial killer, Jame Gumb is twisted. Monstrous in mind and disgusting with actions, he absorbs just enough page time to be interesting but not enough to make it too much about him, to take the focus off the more fascinating areas of this book. And the escape with Hannibal is a tense, intelligently created one.With books like Hannibal Rising, I sometimes found Harris too dry and to the point, but here in Silence he shines, obviously having a lot of enthusiasm to make a multi-layered, psychologically twisted work - the combining of such different people already in various forms of power to those just coming into their own.I tried watching the movie again recently but turned it off after about 20 minutes. Too soon and I already missed some of the depth in dialogue the book held."}, {"userName": "Srividya", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27599745-srividya", "userReview": "What can I say about this book that hasn't been already said! I believe I am one of those last ones to have read this book. And before anyone asks, No - I haven't seen the film either! Although, I have been told, multiple times by everyone close to me, including my husband that I should watch it for Sir Anthony Hopkins. Well, maybe another day, when I am not so chicken about watching movies in this genre.Coming back to the book - it was perfection in complete! I couldn't find fault with it and no it was not because I was in a generous mood or because it came so hyped but simply because it was perfect for me. I won't go much into the plot as it is old news to one and all. However, I shall concentrate on penning down a few of my thoughts, especially the feelings that flitted through me while reading this book.Firstly, and I have to be honest here, I was intimidated when picking this one up. Why you may ask and the answer simply was because of the hype, both around the book and the movie. I did not want to be the one to call it names, when all others raved about it and have me stoned in the center of the universe! :) Well, that was one feeling I lost immediately after I read the first few pages, which despite not being very promising, still held a certain intrigue that made me want to read ahead.Clarice Starling - I felt as if I was a part of her, was inside her head, actually thinking her thoughts and most importantly feeling her fears and emotions. She became the central part of this book to me (well duh she is the central part of the book)! However, when I say that she became central to me, I mean that she and I became almost one in these past few days that I spent reading the book. I felt her every loss, urged her in her every attempt, got bugged with everyone who portrayed a distinct lack of trust in her, rejoiced with those few who trusted her and seemed to encourage her. In short, I was her these past few days as I was reading this book.Dr. Hannibal Lecter - Am sure much has been said, written and discussed about this man and his role in this book and all others in the series. However, to me, he was the most fascinating character ever written about. I have quite a few favourite characters but this one will stay strong and remain etched in my mind, even when I move onto other books. The manner in which he talks to Clarice, the riddles, the almost teasing posers and everything about him makes me feel that he is the best negative character ever written about, who despite all the negativity has a lot of positive in him. I sound weird right? Well call me crazy, if you wish, but I couldn't help but fall into the spell cast by Lecter and I am as entranced as they come. What horrors await me for falling into this trap, I shall know only after I complete the series, till then I shall remain ensnared.Jack Crawford - I saw a marked difference in Crawford in this book and the previous one, Red Dragon. I believe it is because of his personal issues but still I missed the old Jack a little. I found him flustered and disinterested and yet somehow he was still totally on it; like the man he used to be. I loved how the author developed this character throughout the book. In fact, I loved the way the author developed each and every character, be it big or small. It made for a wonderful reading.The Plot - Serial killing with the FBI interested and a rookie trying to solve it. Doesn't sound like much right? However, when you have the above three characters, even a plot as simple as a serial killing takes the form of an epic, which will be remembered for years! Not one part of the plot felt unnecessary to me, whether it was the discourse on science or psychology or even the intricacies of the mind and thinking - they all made the plot stronger and more intriguing to read. I had a few issues with the end, especially in how pat it was and how movie-like it turned out to be but still I won't cut down a single star, for all those stars are definitely deserved by this spine chilling and thrilling tale.Do read it, if you haven't already! It is totally worth the time and effort.Am moving onto the next in this series.

This book is exceptionally written and maintains suspense throughout its 400 pages.There are many reasons why this book is so good:1. You have two villains, instead of the usual one. Both are intriguing, frightening, inhuman.2. Hannibal Lecter is one of the greatest villains ever created. The talks he has with the protagonist are mesmerizing.3. Clarice Starling is a great hero, troubled and flawed, but not in any cliche manner.4. No love story has been forced down into the reader's throat as so many other thriller writers do. It's just the story.5. The writing is great with just the right amount of FBI factoids.This is a horror novel as well as a thriller. I think it is better than the movie on some counts, but not on all of them. If you've already seen the movie, this is still worth a read. I watched the movie before reading the book and still enjoyed it tremendously. Buffalo Bill is a better character in the book and saw is Jack Crawford.To sum it up, go ahead and read it."}, {"userName": "Anushka", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8377084-anushka", "userReview": "MUST READ.MUST READ.MUST FREAKIN' READ.This book blew my brains away!Even though I had seen the movie long back before reading the book, it still got to me.

I have this book 5 stars because it was just so good. Growing up I didn't know Silence of the Lambs was a book. I've seen the movie starring Jodi Foster a handful of times and enjoyed it. Anthony Hopkins is a great Hannibal Lector. Now that I've read the book I can say the movie is a great adaptation. I of course will have to rewatch the movie with fresh eyes to spot any differences, especially since I haven't seen the movie in a while. The endings however are different. That usually is the case when it comes to adaptations.For those that have not seen the movie, our main character is Clarice Starling. She is a student at Quantico and she is studying to be an F.B.I. Agent. There is a big case being worked at the moment, a serial killer, the media had deemed Buffalo Bill. The F.B.I are short handed one day and the fields serial killer expert Jack Crawford decides to request Starling to tag along.This allows our budding student to get her feet wet. This also goes skin deep and now Starling has caught the bug. She wants to continue on this investigation. This book is about Clarice and how she handles herself and this big case. Can she help solve the case? Can she catch the killer?Great second book in this series. I love Hannibal! I know he's a bad guy, but he's just so damn charming lol. Starting Hannibal the third book in this series tomorrow and I'm so excited!

The conflict and themes are varied, the dialogue is genuine, the plot is intricate and the details well researched. The unnamed narrator delivers the story with a controlled omniscient view that allows us to experience the events from many perspectives, even the antagonists, yet the reader's connection with the protagonists, Starling and Crawford, is unquestioned. We root for Starling because we've all been in situations where it felt as if the world worked against us, while we sympathize with Crawford and his tragedy, whether or not we've lost loved ones. As the narrator develops the relationship between Starling and Lecter, we even hope that Dr. Lecter isn't as bad as Crawford suggests.\"Do you think if you caught Buffalo Bill yourself and you made Catherine all right, you could make the lambs stop screaming, do you think they'd be all right too and you wouldn't wake up again in the dark and hear the lambs screaming?

It is this dynamic, and that of the pursuit of Catherine Martin, (and all the events in between), that make The Silence of the Lambs at once addictive, disgusting, brilliant, a fast-paced thriller that has it all: a man who hunts women, hunted by a woman; an enigmatic serial killer, (who can smell anything, it seems), in Dr. Lecter who eats human flesh and wittingly pursues his objectives while he seemingly aids the apprehension of another serial killer, a killer with his own obsession with human flesh; metaphors unique and as thought-provoking as any in literature; and a climactic act and denouement that provides closure and yet leaves us wanting more.The bottom line: The Silence of the Lambs is unputdownable from beginning to end."}], "description": "There's a killer on the loose who knows that beauty is only skin deep, and a trainee investigator who's trying to save her own hide.
