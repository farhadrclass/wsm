You can tell the author was an ad man (like the main character) as he provides a little too much detail about the main character and not enough about some of the other major characters - such as the girlfriend and the butler - (yes, there's a butler). The crime mystery takes up all of about 35 pages of the 380+ total - but its a fun addition (not the main story) and I have to admit that I did not guess the ending. I do have to warn you - this book will move you to take long lesiurely, multi-course lunches and consider quitting your job. Not the best option for a vacation book - way too tempting. I may be doomed - my mother-in-law saw me reading this and gave me three more Mayle books to read! Oh well, bon appetit!"}, {"userName": "R.S.

You're in for a bounder of a tale about Provence involving some English executive (who, in this case, is named Simon) who has had enough of the business world and falls in love with the south of France. Usually for the author, the most colorful characters are the French villagers the main character encounters, but Mayle turns this on his head, introducing us to a hardnosed American ad exec named Zielger (who, in my mind's eye, was Mr. Hart from the film 9 to 5), the somewhat flamboyant and lovable Ernest, Simon's valet (played in full camp by John Michael Higgins ala his character of Scott Donlan from Best in Show), and a crotchety interlocutor with the delightfully Dickensian name of Ambrose Crouch. In between buying a dilapidated gendarmerie and turning it into a hotel, Simon falls in love, rubs elbows with the Mafia, criminal masons, and gets involved in a kidnapping. This is a delightful, quick read that has all the hallmarks of Mayle's clean, yet florid writing, highlighting his ability to spin a wonderful yarn full of memorable characters that makes the reader want to visit Provence, if only to get a glimpse of the region that so inspires the author."}, {"userName": "Doris Jean", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26634995-doris-jean", "userReview": "Loved it, clever and entertaining. The book had an interesting tempo. It started slowly, and during the first twenty pages I kept thinking to myself: \"This book isn't too good, maybe I won't bother reading it\". But because I had really liked the previous books I had read which were authored by Peter Mayle, I persisted and I am happy to say that the book gradually accelerated and got better and better and toward the last half I never wanted to put it down. When it ended I was sorry because I wanted more to read. I wanted to hear more after the conclusions wrapped it up.The characters were well developed and entertaining. We had our hero, Simon who is a rich and successful ad man (yes, just like the TV series \"Mad Men\" although this 1993 book pre-dated \"Mad Men\" which played 2007 \u2013 2016). His ladies are his malicious spendthrift ex-wife Caroline and then he meets blonde Nicole in her mid-thirties. Nicole is now struggling financially because her ex has a new girlfriend who has convinced him to cut off Nicole's alimony. Nicole suggests an empty building to Simon which is perfect for a hotel, and Simon decides to open the Hotel Pastis. The book is salted throughout with titillating descriptions of Nicole which may please many readers: \"...her coat swinging away from her legs, her face lit up by a smile he felt in his stomach.\", \"...sensual rhythm of a confident cook...elegant in her apron tied tightly...accentuated her slim waist.\", \"...scented skin of her cheek...\" \"...kissed...her scent, fresh and spicy...\", \"...she touched his hand...felt a brief twinge of lust.\", \"...hint of perfectly tanned cleavage...her silk shirt...\", \"..high boots and a micro-skirt bent over the bonnet of the car...her bottom presented to the oncoming traffic...\".Other characters were Ernest, Simon's trusty aide, cook, butler, manager, you-name-it; Mrs. Gibbons the dog, a bull terrier who looks like a Japanese wrestler with jaws capable of cracking rocks; an advertising client, the Condom Marketing Board (The Rubber Barons); Madame Pons the chef. She says eating is too important to spoil with talk of work, the table is for pleasure. Enrico is the hit man who likes his rabbit with the correct sauce, a sauce properly thickened with blood. There is a gang of eight bank robbers/kidnappers headed by The General helped by Jojo. Uncle William is a social embarrassment to Simon, he is an artist who is always continually on the run, usually from some rich widow he has promised to marry, and he turns up every couple of years to borrow money from Simon. There were many more equally entertaining or amusing characters.I looked up \"pastis\" and it means \"mash-up\" and is a kind of French bootleg which started when absinthe was outlawed. People started fermenting and distilling their own imitation with various seeds and herbs of combos such as pernod, fennel, licorice, anise. When one adds ice water it turns milky and is especially popular as a summer morning or noon drink.I loved the small details about the hotel. They transplanted an olive tree and were to be sure to paint the bark on the south side so that the tree would face the same way after the re-plant so it would have the same orientation and settle into its new home at once, otherwise it would need two or three years to orient. Mrs. Pons would only allow flowers on the dining tables for the eyes only, not the nose. She said their odors fight with the scent of the food. Nicole led Simon to a replica of the Mannequin Pis (in Brussels, a tumescent cherub micturating through copper piping into a stone basin and he buys it to decorate Hotel Pastis.The plot was great. As I said, it chugged along slowly, then gradually gathered speed, and then the ending was racing. The plot had a natural flow even though it was lightly tinted with hints of fantasy. All the loose ends were neatly tied together at the end with some great unexpected twists. But I was left wanting to hear more about the characters.You may enjoy this book if you speak French or are a Francophile because it is also salted throughout with French phrases, idioms, culture, and of course \u2013 FOOD! For phrases, how about \"Il p\u00e8te plus haut que son cul!\" for one who has an exaggerated idea of his own importance? For a menu: \"...tapenade souffle, terrine of aubergine, roast turbot with a sauce of butter and fines herbes, les fromages maison, hot cr\u00eapes wrapped around a filling of chilled whipped cream and vodka\" ? I did not like page 229 when \"the three of them arrived at Les Halles\". Les Halles was the famous \"belly of Paris\", an ancient underground marketplace mentioned in writings over eleven hundred years ago. Les Halles was demolished and destroyed in 1971. The markets dispersed and some were moved outside Paris, and many others were moved into a group of new buildings in a shopping mall called the \"Forum des Halles\". This book is dated 1993 so Les Halles was gone. So I wish the author had named his meeting place more authentically.I was captivated and entertained with this clever book which was sophisticated, witty, and happy. \"The Management Welcomes Dogs. They Do Not Clean Their Shoes on the Curtains.They do Not Make Pipi in the Bidet.We Ask Our Amiable Clientele to Follow Their Example.\""}, {"userName": "Sarah Shields", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1812832-sarah-shields", "userReview": "I didn't love this book.

Every Peter Mayle book makes me feel as if I've been traveling and getting to see the French countryside. In this one, it's through British advertising mogul Simon Shaw, who has built his business until it's international in size. As the novel begins, the work that he has thrown himself into and excelled at is losing its luster and he is freshly divorced from a spendthrift he likely shouldn't have married to begin with. Ernest, butler/driver/cook/aide who assists in most aspects of Simon's life, reminds him that everyone in the company except Simon himself has taken vacation during the last year and suggests he take a few days, and Liz in the office seconds the suggestion. As Simon heads through France to Saint-Tropez, a suggestion from Phillipe Murat over drinks in Paris and a tractor on the roadway alters his destination and makes in infinitely more interesting.In the meanwhile, in the town of Isle-sur-Sorgue, two old friends who had spent time together as petty criminals in the Marseille jail, met for the first time in two years. Jojo imparts to The General that he had been working on a roof and overheard the laughter of the installers of the bank's new extravagant security system. It seems that they moved the strong room to the back of the bank for extra security never realizing that it was exactly over the old river drain. Eventually, this plot encroaches on Simon's revamped lifestyle and it's a great little journey."}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28640440-pat", "userReview": "A wonderful light, fun read.

He is tired of his ex's constant grasping for more money and the shallowness of colleagues at his advertising agency; in fact he's tired of the whole spinning money-making machine (though not so much the money) and is ready for a change when he meets a savvy, French woman with an interesting idea.Simon begins the process of disentangling himself from life in the city and together with Nicole (the French woman, who is conveniently gorgeous and available as well as savvy) and his faithful sidekick, Ernest, opens a hotel in the south of France. While this is all happening a group of locals are making plans for a heist that will thicken the plot and complicate things for Simon et al. The most interesting character is Ernest. He started out as Simon's chauffeur and over the past ten years has become his personal assistant, valet and friend. He takes care of Simon's expensive cars, he cooks and he does pretty much whatever else needs attending to, all with common sense and a healthy dose of wry wit. There's a vulnerability written into his character that makes him both likeable and memorable.The others, Simon and Nicole especially, are not-very-interesting stereotypes who never stand up from the page as real people. I had little to no understanding of Nicole's personality even as I turned the last page of the book, and though I had all kinds of information about Simon's life, he too remained remote as a person. The various settings are great, all fancy homes, offices and restaurants in London and New York, both wonderful places to be if you can afford their bright, beautiful sides. Then of course once the story moves to France every scene is inevitably perfect. The sheer \"Provence-ness\" of it should be enticement enough to read the book.The plot is a little predictable but it makes for a pleasant light reading experience, a fun bit of escapism and sometimes that's exactly what we're looking for.

Things change for Simon when he takes a small vacation in the French countryside and meets a local woman named Nicole Bouvier. Although their initial encounter is brief, there is some obvious attraction between them both and over the next month they begin dating, at which point Nicole tells Simon her new plan for him is to build a new hotel in her home town. Simon quickly goes along with it and a much of the story is about its construction.A secondary story is running parallel to this, that story being about a bunch of local criminals having a plan to rob a bank which first involves them getting in serious cycling shape (as their getaway will be accomplished as posing as a bike racing team). The author takes care to make sure that these criminals don't really seem that bad, but more of a cast of lovable losers.The two story lines intersect after the hotel is open and the bank is robbed. A friend of the hotel (the son of a wealthy American CEO who has dealings with Simon's previous advertising firm) runs into the bank robbers and is then kidnapped and ransomed (of course in a friendly sort way).The story is a little reminiscent of Carl Hiassen in that there is a cast of quirky characters and multiple story lines and points of view through out. While constantly tongue-in-cheek, it never reaches the zany level. The book is an easy enough read, but I'd be surprised if it proves to be memorable. Although I finished the book only days before, I had to go back and look up the main characters names b/c they have already evaporated from my memory.

In counterpoint, Mayle crosscuts to the escapades of a lovable band of criminals who are conspiring to break into the vault of a bank in the neighboring village of Isle-sur-Sorges. As the threads of the plot begin to converge, Mayle displays his satiric eye for social foibles by skewering advertising execs in England and the U.S.; he is equally adept at evoking typical Provencal villagers. Wickedly sharp and sympathetic at the same time, his characterizations are accurate down to nuances of class differences, voice, accent and vocabulary. The novel is as smooth as a sip of pastis, and one hopes that Mayle will find his segue into fiction equally addictive."}], "description": "With his national bestsellers A Year in Provence and Toujours Provence, Peter Mayle gave new meaning to the phrase \"great escape.\" Now he has written a delightful novel of romance, adventure, and tongue-in-cheek suspense, set in the beguiling French region he has staked out as his own.", "title": "Hotel Pastis: A Novel of Provence\n      \n          (Provence)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/562549.Hotel_Pastis", "average": 3.7, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320548690l/562549.jpg", "reviews": 319, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19316.Peter_Mayle", "name": "Peter Mayle"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Travel", "Cultural", "Food and Drink", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/562549.Hotel_Pastis", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/921045.Hotel_Pastis", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40189.A_Year_in_Provence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44255.Toujours_Provence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40184.Encore_Provence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40183.French_Lessons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40190.A_Good_Year", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
