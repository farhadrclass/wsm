Now I need the physical copy"}, {"userName": "Andre", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5321728-andre", "userReview": "The provocative title is obviously designed to maximize exposure. The first question that comes to mind, is what does Black privilege look like? The subtitle, Opportunity Comes To Those Who Create It, is really the foundation of the book. Charlamagne has become a popular radio host through his syndicated The Breakfast Club. His niche has been challenging those in hip-hop, asking the questions that others shy away from. So his book traces his rise from a small town in South Carolina to his current place in media. The book is part memoir, part self help, and part inspiration. The book is divided not by chapters, but by eight principles. Early in the work, the feel of just belief in yourself and God and you too will be a success felt dominant and a bit fantastical. If those were the only criteria, everyone would be a success. As the book progresses it begins to pick up steam with humor, solid advice that young folks may find helpful and inspirational. The one principle that guides the book is the now popular, \"live your truth.\" Charlamagne makes it sound more like embrace the things about you that are true, to take power away from those who would use your flaws against you. He uses the example of him looking like a teenage mutant ninja turtle. He learned to accept that about himself, or what he called his bookie nose, i.e. big nose. These are more examples of accepting your appearance, rather than living a certain truth. The thing I think is missing is the discussion about having the space wherein one can live their truth. That is not explored. If your truth interferes with what society deems unacceptable and threatening, then what? I think Charlamagne may have become aware of this because in the final principle he states, \"Don\u2019t get it twisted: I\u2019m not a having an \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d moment here. Not for a second am I suggesting that racism isn\u2019t real. It\u2019s as real as the air we breathe. And the evidence is everywhere.\"He writes in a way that I think will be relatable to his fans, youngsters and his own age group with at times pretty sold advice, like principle five. Put The Weed In The Bag! The reference of putting the weed in the bag comes from the movie Belly, when a character was talking to some young want to be hustlers, who hadn't sold anything but were talking about getting money, his advice to them was \"put the weed in the bag.\" Learn how to do that first and move on from there.That principle basically deals with embracing the process. People often want to start at the top or always look for the shortcut, most times there aren't any. Understanding the things you may have to do in order to achieve your end goal is a valuable lesson to hear. He worked as a co-host on the very popular Wendy Williams show for a year and a half without pay. So that provides a very powerful example of dispensing advice by way of real experience.\"If I\u2019ve had any advantage in this life, it\u2019s that I was encouraged to read.\" I like the importance he placed on books and the value of acquiring knowledge, constantly being in an inquisitive state. \"Books are what provided me with a sense of escape when the tension between my parents made our home feel suffocating. Books helped give me the confidence to dream bigger than I was supposed to as a poor black boy growing up in the rural South. Books are where I got the name Charlamagne (even if I did misspell it). My life is a living testament to the transformative power of books.\"Perhaps his book will become one that will be talked about as one to be read and shared. I received this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Patrice Hoffman", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5405898-patrice-hoffman", "userReview": "To say Black Privilege:Opportunity Comes to Those Who Create It wasn't compulsively readable, I'd be making the understatement of the century and I'll gladly expound on that matter in this review. My initial interest in Black Privilege was based on the current racial makeup this country is experiencing where more and more of the systemic \"white privilege\", the black community has been speaking of, is proving to be true. With video footage of cops being Judge and Jury to people of color, the racist undertones that the current administration has said against President Obama during his tenure that blatantly ignored or chalked up to fake news... never mind all that. My point is that, I was captivated by the title Black Privilege because I wanted to understand what that meant. Thankfully Charlamagne tha God doesn't use this platform as a way to further the divide but rather to encourage anyone reading to use their \"white privilege\", \"black privilege\", or \"gay privilege\" to achieve their goals in life. Now! I don't listen to radio... usually ever and I don't particularly listen to The Breakfast Club, the syndicated hip-hop radio show that Charlamagne co-hosts with Angela Yee and DJ Envy. Since I do listen to hip-hop and R&B, I'd have to be living under a rock not to know what Charlamagne tha God is. Plus, the infamous Birdman interview flooded my timeline for months. There wasn't anyone I didn't know who didn't want \"respeck\" when you mentioned their name. So yes, Charlamange and company are a big part of hip-hop history and his voice is one of the strongest (and boldest) in the radio community.Black Privilege: Opportunity Comes to Those Who Create It is a memoir/coming-of-age/cautionary/self-help book all rolled into one. Charlamange in his own words and voice, provides 8 nuggets of information that encourage the reader to live, speak, aspire to their truth. He found early in life that he was going to speak his mind and his opinion no matter what because it was his truth. And because of his often controversial stance and willingness to be heard he's one of the most revered names in radio and the hip-hop community.Larry Mckelvey, aka Charlamagne, uses his experiences as a youth in an effort to stand behind the nuggets of truth he drops. Charlamange explains that he could have been someone out there lost with no future where he \"was caught up in building street cred during my teenage years. But fifteen years later, I can report there is not one major purchase I've even been able to make using it.\"I almost feel like that line nugget of truth should be required reading and reflection for the youth in Chicago that are terrorizing the city with unprecedented violence. He learned that thinking that the streets was where it's at was only going to lead him to jail or death, or somewhere drunk under a tree.Black Privilege also encourages the reader to find their truth and not everyone telling you a different route is being a hater. Many people need to hear Simon Cowell say their performance was the worse or that they just don't have the skills to be a hoop star. Many people think the only success there is is what the media purports it to be. Not everyone one can be a Jay-Z or Beyonce. Those roles are already taken. But, you could be the person that cures AIDS or cancer if you follow your truth and not someone else's.Honestly, as I read Black Privilege, I couldn't help but Google some of the interviews he spoke of in this book and I think that's what makes this title even more enjoyable to read. Like I mentioned, I wasn't a fan nor a hater of Charlamagne. I had very limited information of who he is/was in the radio industry so to see that he wasn't blowing steam up my ass was refreshing. There are so many memoir out there that have been proven to be fudged a little, I was more than excited that this wasn't. Really, I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed reading Black Privilege all day. There are tons of people (myself included) that need credit for the stupid things I've done as well as an overhaul in time management. Maybe I'm reading this book at the right time in my life where I've decided to go back to school (for the 3rd time) in an effort to \"put the weed in the bag\" and pursue a career. Either way it goes, Charlagmange is a very relevant voice that should be heard and this book, Black Privilege should be read. Yes it is vulgar and extremely jarring at times but really... could we expect anything less from the \"Prince of Pissing People off\"?Copy Provided by Touchstone via Netgalley"}, {"userName": "Philipp", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp", "userReview": "Part autobiography, part lots of life advice, very American as you may expect from the title and the cover and basically everythingThe good:- There is some seriously good life advice here that is useful to read in your 20s and 30s. You have to start somewhere which is usually small (here called 'putting the weed in the bag', after the movie Belly), it's better to have a foot in the door than having nothing. Lots of good stuff on procrastination and how you should always keep on pursuing your goals, perhaps even dropping your dreams if they turn out to actually be someone else's dreams. Nothing happens overnight, opportunity comes to those willing to put in the work etc. pp.- Read books - always keep on reading, read books that are outside of what you normally read, read books with unfamiliar perspectives, read anything you can get your hands on, I fully agree!- There is a lot of talk about God and how he believes that God has a plan specifically for him, I found this quote very interesting: 'I have to believe that. Otherwise, I\u2019d never have transcended the circumstances I was born into.' That must be an exhausting kind of belief, one where you constantly have to fight off doubts.The ugly:- lots of life detail more for people who are into Charlamagne, I wasn't particularly interested in all of his exploits, more for his fans- there's something that annoys me with all this 'you got to be an entrepreneur' stuff, something that's also common in science and medicine - a complete ignorance of one's own mental health. Charlamagne writes about how sleep is the most important thing, but then goes into how you technically have 168 hours per week to pursue your passions, you just have to cut back on a lot of stuff, where he describes how most of the time he gets up at 3:45am to work on the morning radio, then has various meetings and other tapings, and goes to sleep at 23:00. That's 4:45 hours of sleep, bit more than half of what I need, I can't see how that's healthy. Scientists and doctors have a similar thing going where they think that they have to pull the most out of the hours allotted to them per week, which never goes well (why do you think burnout is so common in medicine?). Charlamagne does not mention burnout or mental health which I personally think is dangerous to ignore.The fun:- It made me realise a parallel between 'nerd culture' and 'hip hop culture' - the dumb, edgy, misspelled 'name' you give yourself when you're 14 have to stick with you for the rest of your life, how else would people recognise who you are? Changing your name would be like replacing your entire body with a different one.

For anyone unfamiliar with Charlamagne, he\u2019s 1 of the hosts of The Breakfast Club radio show and extremely blunt, honest and unfiltered, regardless of who he\u2019s speaking with or interviewing. I used to listen to the show on my way to work in the mornings for a couple years, and while I didn\u2019t always agree with what he said or how he felt, I did admire his lack of hesitation in asking the questions everyone wants to know. He is legitimately there for the audience, not to appease the radio network. That said, it\u2019s no surprise the same characteristics of his personality were evident throughout the book, and not censored in the slightest. I\u2019m not surprised by his writing the book - he\u2019s got an interesting story to share, but I am surprised by how much I was able to take away from it. The book is part memoir, in which Charlamagne is very forthcoming about his many mistakes, and part motivating. How to do what needs to be done, to get where you want to be - Creating Opportunity. I liked that he gave credit to books for shaping his perspectives and keeping him curious to continue learning in life. He also mentions addressing your perceived weaknesses head on, taking them away from someone who\u2019s potentially trying to use them against you. This is not the first time this theory has been suggested by someone but it was again interesting. I liked his honesty too. \u201dBe miserable. Or motivate yourself.

Let me start by saying, either you like him, or you don't. There's usually no middle opinion when it comes to this radio personality. Just his name alone screams arrogance. I mean come on, who names himself \"Tha God\"? Charlamagne does! That's who! (If you want to know how he came up with that name you've got to read the book). And in his New York Times best selling memoir, he shares how he became one of the most successfully, outspoken shock jocks on the radio today.Raised in Moncks Corner, South Carolina Lenard McKelvey aka Charlamagne Tha God was a pretty low key child. Raised in a double-wide trailer with his five silbings, in his early years this self proclaimed \"nerd\" was an avid reader and heavily influenced by books. However, in middle school that influence would change as a new force entered his life changing his perspective of the world forever. That force was hip-hop. After hearing the song Paid In Full by Eric B and Rakim that teenage boy slowly began his transformation from Lenard the nerd, to brutally honest Charlamagne. The book opens with Charlamagne sharing the story of how he first started living his truth. In this unquestionably hilarious account, he details how he almost got strangled to death as a result of talking trash about someone behind their back. I'm telling you...this story was so funny, I had to share it with others. And as I did, just thinking about what he had written, made me laugh so hard I cried \ud83d\ude02. Sharing that story first was perfect for setting the tone of the book. Black Privilege is the perfect combination of humor and knowledge. It combines all the elements required for a great memoir. The author digs up his own dirt and uncovers his own mistakes and disappointments in a way that lets us know it's ok to be beautifully flawed creatures. This book contain's no empty boasting, or arrogant pretension like we often read in other celebrity memoirs. Black Privilege is both motivating and inspiring in a very relatable way. This is the story of a man who was kicked out of multiple high schools, went to jail multiple times, has no college or trade school education, and came from a trailer park in South Carolina, who went on to move to New York, work with Wendy Williams, and eventually become host of one of the top rated radio talk shows in America. If you are unable to find inspiration in this story...Houston there's a problem.I highly recommend this book. It is simply a really good read. It sat on my bookshelf for six months before I cracked it open. And I can honestly say I was not disappointed. After reading Charlamagne's many laugh-out-loud narratives, I walked away from this book with a much better understanding of the mind that has formulated some of media's most controversial opinions in the world of hip hop."}, {"userName": "Kim Raccoon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30362363-kim-raccoon", "userReview": "I liked this book enough that I would have read it a few more times if I hadn't had to return it to the library. Charlamagne has a lot of good insights and advice and no nonsense straight talk. I want some people I know to read this.The only thing that threw me off was the section about white devils right after the two sections about how everyone should be loving and accepting of everyone including women and gays. He goes on to say that 80% of white people are bad and out to get you and I'm gonna call his bs on this. Maybe that's his truth (which is I'm sure is what he'd say) but out of the 7+billion people int he world, almost 2 billion are white, so for simplicity's sake, ~800,000,000+ are white devils?

Unsurprisingly, I never knew most of the things I found out reading this book. This was a majority of why I found this story so great and the book does not become repetitive because Charlamagne continues to hold the interest of his reader with an anecdote while teaching something new from those experiences.

It's likely that at least a few people, including Funkmaster Flex and Wendy Williams' husband, will be upset by this book.

He drops some noteworthy gems that you will find yourself putting to use right away. Just like the man the book is VERY blunt, A LOT of TMI, and shockingly honest. What I enjoyed most was how easy it was to read. He uses a conversation writing style that is very down to earth. There are passages that were straight up hilarious, so expect some laughs. The whole time I was reading I could hear Charlamagne\u2019s voice as if he were reading it to me. Black Privilege would make a great Audible.  This book is comprised of personal examples detailing how the different strategies and principles were used by Charlamagne. His ideas were presented in vignettes (some much longer than others\u2026) instead of a massive tome that overwhelms more than inspires. Nothing like seeing that the writer struggles in the same ways as the rest of us. The main idea Black Privilege imbued for me is that a person should take full and conscious ownership of one's own life. Live your truth. There is no such thing as luck, so therefore people who achieve most in life are those who keep a persistently positive attitude, have a clear goal in mind, and are willing to work hard at it. One must be willing to take a risk now and then to pull away from the ordinary masses to become extraordinary.  I\u2019ve never been a self-help/inspirational book kind of reader, but if you are I\u2019d recommend this book. It\u2019s not just directed towards Black people only.

My book club read the book, I listened to the audio version of the book & we liked what we read. He grew up with two parents, he had structure, he had a mother & father who gave him guidelines & rules & told him about consequences, however, he has a strong personality. He did listen to instruction even if he didn't follow instructions. He had a moral compass where his Spiritual life was developed with his mother's guidance. Even when he stopped practicing the Jehovah's Witness religion, he always knew there was a Supreme Being that he should align himself with. The different gentlemen he met along the way in his developing career, he listened to their advice & put their knowledge in the back of his head, used it when needed & pushed through life. He refused to *be a drunk under the tree* & made a conscience decision to do better for himself. Even when family members & homies were not doing the right thing....when he saw...negative (some deaths) he decided the negative life was not for him anymore, after he experienced the negative the crowd he & Daddy was portraying. If artists could not accept his critique (truth) of music or people, that is their fault. He saw what he saw & said what he said. I took him to be a guarded man for in the book, he only referred to his wife by her pet name. Their love story is believable & the conflict that surrounded their on-off relationship.

Some of the things he said in this book were motivational on perseverance and how to chase your dreams to make a plan. This book is really funny but in a way serious I loved the part where he spoke his \"roasting\" sessions on certain artists as well being completely honest with no sensory. One of my favorite quotes of this book would be \"learn to put the weed in the bag first\" as he was talking about when they were barely starting to drug deal. Another one of my favorite quotes would be his P.Y.P something I'd also found interesting was how he changed his name from Charles to Charlamagne."}, {"userName": "Krystina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21090122-krystina", "userReview": "At first, I was somewhat hesitant to read this book. Not sure why, but I'm glad I decided to give it a try. I listened to the audiobook version, which is narrated by Charlamagne. I don't think anyone else would have been able to read it better than him. What I loved most about this book is his raw honesty about his mistakes, fears, and continuous quest for self-improvement. He provides tons of wisdom in the form of principles and God jewels."}, {"userName": "Tapiwa Matsika", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17505045-tapiwa-matsika", "userReview": "Having watched The Breakfast Club a few times (especially when its a show that\u2019s ruffled someone\u2019s feathers!!), I think you will find this book interesting because you get some insight into how Charlamagne grew up (not as rosy as one would think), his interesting views on being fired from a few jobs and why his opinions are almost always brutally (rude even) honest!"}, {"userName": "Ncjammy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33506043-ncjammy", "userReview": "I had only heard good things about this book but it still was much better than I expected. This was a very inspirational read. The bottom line is remain true to yourself, remain faithful and remain steadfast in reaching your goals. Charlamagne has a really interesting story. I enjoyed it in the same way I enjoyed Gucci Mane's memoir."}, {"userName": "Amar Pai", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86362-amar-pai", "userReview": "Pretty compelling even though I think his scheduling advice is bullshit. \"If you want to follow your dreams you have to get up at 3:45, work 40 hours, dedicate 20 hours to your next level goal, gym, sleep, rinse repeat.\" Okay mayneAll said though Charlamagne is more enlightened then you'd expect. And this book is as entertaining as you'd expect"}, {"userName": "Natasha", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5335987-natasha", "userReview": "Real and raw as only Charlamagne can be. I'm glad he narrated his own story. It was very interesting to hear of his childhood and leading into how he got his start and of course where he is today. He is crass and blunt but seems pretty well rounded and obviously well spoken. I enjoyed listening to him tell about his life as well as drop life jewels."}], "description": "Instant New York Times Bestseller Charlamagne Tha God\u2014the self-proclaimed \u201cPrince of Pissing People Off,\u201d co-host of Power 105.1\u2019s The Breakfast Club, and \u201chip-hop\u2019s Howard Stern\u201d\u2014shares his unlikely success story as well as how embracing one\u2019s truths is a fundamental key to success and happiness.In his new book, Charlamagne Tha God presents his comic, often controversial, and always brutally honest insights on how living an authentic life is the quickest path to success.
