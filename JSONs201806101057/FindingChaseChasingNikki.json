She is his destiny.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t possible for me to have feelings for Brittney. My heart wasn\u2019t in my chest anymore.

When Chase starts to have feelings for Brittney..feelings he thought was buried, he can't believe it. This causes him to have an internal battle bringing him face to face with his deepest fears.ThoughtsI have mixed emotions about this book. Lacey Weatherford does an awesome job with pulling at your heart strings. You want to believe that Chase can survive and you want him to believe in love again.Characters I think she did a very good job with allowing you to connect with her characters. Weatherford is the queen of PG-13 steam which I loved even though I tend to want my YA's a bit steamier.Yes, I enjoyed it the book....BUT in my honest opinion I felt the ending was a bit rushed. And I also felt that the two twist was a bit predictable. The epilogue ROCKED! And when Lacey gave her story I had to fight back the tears. Her story alone almost made me raise it to 4 stars but...In the end I didn't\nDear readers,\nWhy 3.5 stars? Well that is mainly due to what I just stated above. The twist were in my humble opinion predictable. And the ending felt rushed. I think I would have enjoyed a tad more drama. *Shrugs* but hey that's just me. If you started the series I definitely think you should finish it. I would recommend this series to clean teen YA Lovers. As well as readers looking for a deep meaningful story that focuses on love, overcoming tragedy and learning to deal with the cards life has dealt.My RatingsCharacters- Love love lovedWriting Style- GoodPlot/Storyline- A little to predictable BUT I still enjoyed it!Steam Factor- PG-13 CLEANOverall- I enjoyed it!!Now go forth and read.

I could not wait to get my hands on this book! I\u2019m not gunna lie, I was really reluctant to give Brittany a go in this. She just wasn\u2019t Nikki!And Chase and Nikki were meant to be! So I looked down on her for a while\u2026 but then I decided I was being stupid and Nikki was dead and I loved Chase too much to let him suffer anymore. I wanted him happy. (Yes I know they are fictional characters! But still it affected me alright!) As soon as I let go of that I did actually enjoy this book. \nTHE STORY\n This picks up 9 months after the accident. Chase promised Nikki that he would go after his dreams and be happy. But he hasn\u2019t been able to move on.Everyone is worried about him. His Grandfather makes him promise to at least try one new thing a day.Chase is going to college with his best friend Brett, Brett\u2019s girlfriend Tana and Brett\u2019s twin sister and his good friend Brittany. Chase starts to see Britt as something .. more\u2026 \n but he is conflicted Nikki was his future. He\u2019s betraying her memory and their love.Britt is starting to bring him back to life. This story is about heartache, grieving, friendship, learning to move on, accepting things happen for a reason, it\u2019s ok to love again and that the heart can love more than one person at the same time. \nMY THOUGHTS\n Did I like this story? Yes I did! Did I love it as much as Chasing Nikki? No I didn\u2019t. Did I cry in this? Yes I did. Usually when Chase did! Do I want to play paint twister? Hell YES I do! I loved the dream he had featuring Nikki. I loved how he didn\u2019t fall back into his old self. I loved the epilogue. There was enough steam to know what was happening but it was kept clean as well. It was great how we see them go from friends to lovers, I was a bit worried he was just going to use her and ruin their friendship but I had nothing to worry about! And As Chase reminded me he did in fact see Brittany first but she had a boyfriend. I was scared shitless leading up to the 90% mark that Lacey was going to do it again.. I even had tears in my eyes just waiting for IT to happen! THANK GOD nothing happened like it did in the last book! Yes there was a twist, I had a feeling there was going to be, but it didn\u2019t stop my world turning. However, I felt like the ending was rushed after that\u2026 Just a little\u2026 tie the ends up nicely kind of thing\u2026I adored the Epilogue though! Lacey\u2019s Author note at the end?! \nOMG!! Had me bawling\u2026 \nso beautiful.. Lacey tells us that this story is loosely based on something that happened to her when she was young.Just utterly heartbreaking and beautiful. Thank you for giving us these truly wonderful stories! And to find out that Chase was based on a real guy!? AwesomeChasing Nikki will forever hold a top spot in my heart!"}, {"userName": "Lucy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8509882-lucy", "userReview": "So this being the second book after chasing Nikki, it follows chase moving away to college and trying to get over his heartbreak (or me get over my own heartbreak, I sobbed at the end of the last book). I really struggled with this book, I cant say I've ever read a book where I got so emotionally attached the the characters (Chase & Nikki) to then follow one of those characters in a new book and watch them fall in love with someone else. I just could not get over who I thought he was supposed to be with. So when he was developing these strong emotions I just couldn't connect and didn't feel it. I knew I would struggle to love any one but Nikki but it just ruined the book for me. I think chase moved on before I did... This is still a very good book by a great author, but just not for me because the previous book didn't end the way I wanted and there was no way to right that wrong..!  boo hoo  :( I'd highly recommend everyone read Chasing Nikki, its an amazing read, and possibly read this one if you can handle it!

After losing his father and girlfriend Nikki, Chase is doing the best he can to survive and cope with his loss. He is trying to stay busy, keep clean, and getting ready to go away to college on a football scholarship. Chase's best friend Brett, Brett's girlfriend Tana and Brett's sister Britteny are all going to the same school as him.

It was too painful to lose them.\nChase feels guilty. He doesn't understand how he can be having these strong feelings for Britt when he is still very much in love with Nikki. Chase gets some much needed advice from his step father can relate to Chase better than anyone.\n\"Love the things she gave you- those are yours to keep. It's okay to open your heart and share it with someone else too.\"\nAfter dealing with his conflicting emotions, Chase decides to act on his feelings towards Britteny. Everything between the two of them changes.Finding Chase is a wonderful sequel to Chasing Nikki. It's a story with a powerful message- it's okay to move on with life and to love again. Chase's journey of love, life, friendship, loss, and moving on was a pleasure to read. Chase and Britts relationship was different than Chase and Nikki's relationship, but still great. It started out as a beautiful friendship and moved on to something more. The ending of this book was perfect and I loved the epilogue. So glad to see Chase able to move on and grow as a person.

I honestly can\u2019t as I hate spoiler reviews; they rob the reader of experiencing the journey for themselves. It would be unfair to you as a reader if you have not been through Chase\u2019s journey in book #1. A journey that will break your heart and stay with you forever, such is the emotion and the affect it will have on you.Chase\u2019s life is turned upside down in book #1 and he has an extreme sense of guilt and torment. In Finding Chase we find him still lost and in limbo. He has cut himself off from life and its joys. His heart is in pieces, he is numb.Chase made a promise but has so far been unable to keep it, he can\u2019t move on he doesn\u2019t have the fight in him. However, after receiving a full ride football scholarship to ASU, Chase goes off to College with his gang that consist of best friends, Brett, Tana and Britt and his journey of healing and self-forgiveness begins. The memories remain strong yet the way he remembers slowly changes. Chase learns to forgive himself and sheds the torment of guilt. He accepts that he is alive. Everything changes\u2026..Finding Chase was an amazing follow up, and I have to admit I was so worried I would feel uncomfortable reading it after the impact Chasing Nikki had on me. I didn\u2019t. I absolutely love Chase. I want to pick him out of my kindle and put him in my pocket for safe keeping only after I have hugged him silly.The journey this Author takes you on with these two books is one of the most emotional I have ever encountered. The depth of feelings conveyed with her words burrow into your heart and every feeling and emotion is so incredibly real. Love is so powerful and the messages in these books are so poignant. And yes, I got my closure! Please pick these books up\u2026.along with a huge packet of tissues!!"}, {"userName": "Ramonelle Hiteroza", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6999991-ramonelle-hiteroza", "userReview": "Be still, my heart. CHASING NIKKI has become one of my favorite series ever. And I mean it's on the top. A beautiful, heart-breaking story of a man who's fate has really messed up with him. I was absolutely invested in Chase Walker's story to finding his happiness after going through the most difficult time in his life. Losing Nikki was the most horrible thing that has happened to him. And I felt his sorrow, and pain, and I loved him for going through with life to live up with his promise to Nikki even if every part of him wanted to just give up. Sniff.I was in, like, twenty pages or something in this book and I already bawled my eyes out. But of course, we see how Chase healed though slowly, but it was amazing. He deserved it because he's an amazing guy. I loved him and Brittany together.In Chasing Nikki, Brittany was one of the people who stood by Chase and offered him true friendship. I'm so happy that it was her he found his happiness with. Though, honestly, at first, I kind of had doubts since Chase still longed for Nikki and it wouldn't be fair to Brittany but he totally proved that he really loves her. And yes, it was true, it was Brittany who first caught his attention in the first place.Oh and the almost ending part almost made me want to punch something. I was like frustrated to see Chase go through that again. Imagine my relief...So, this book is highly recommended. A great story about true love and not losing hope and will definitely squeeze your heart and put a smile on your face. And it was inspired from the story of the author. Brilliant.P.S. How cool is that Chase is inspired by a real guy. That's him on the cover, right? He's good in the eyes. :)"}, {"userName": "Carrie Sims Schutze", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10209661-carrie-sims-schutze", "userReview": "So, I had to give myself a few days off to mourn after reading Chasing Nikki, before I felt I could start reading this book. I had a feeling of what was going to happen in this story and I just wasn't sure if I was ready to move on! lol! I know that sounds silly, but the first book just affected me so much and I knew there was no way this story could end the way I wanted to because Nikki was dead. I have nothing against Brittany, I thought she was great in the first book and this book, but she just isn't Nikki and I was having a hard time with Chase being with someone else. I still cried, so another box of tissue was in order for this tear jerker, even though it wasn't near as bad. Overall, it's a beautiful story written with a lot of heartache. After reading about the author, I was just sad all over again. I guess it takes living through such a tragedy in order to be able to put it into words that make your readers feel all of the emotions the characters are going through. The author definately wrote an amazing story! I highly recommend it!!"}, {"userName": "CatchTheseWords", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4511019-catchthesewords", "userReview": "This book picks up around 9 months after the events of Chasing Nikki. It deals with Chase\u2019s grief and how he starts to rebuild his life again.I didn\u2019t know how I was going to deal with this book. I wanted Chase to be happy but I wanted Nikki to come back, even though that wasn\u2019t possible. I was happy, happy that Chase got his life back on track, that unlike when his dad died his friends stuck by him, that he still played football, learnt that it is ok to love someone else.But Brittney still wasn\u2019t my favourite character. She was nice, she\u2019d clearly been a great friend to Nikki and definitely supported Chase, but I didn\u2019t really feel anything when they got together.

Okay people so I wasny to excited about the idea of Brit and Chase getting together so i didn't reallt enjoy this book as much as the first..... wait okay let me refrase that i HATED that nicki got cut off and they put this britney bit** here. Yeah okay so she did help Chase through the tough times but damn women i was rooting for nicki the whole way and then Chase has feelings for her. Okay my emotiones were freaking everywere at this time. I was crying, i was happy, i was mad i was just crazy! In the epilogue when i saw the word WIFE right there BAM! i died. My little book reading heart stopped. I was so confused with my feelings towards this book i was just frustrated. Okay yeah sure I'm happy for Chase and that but come on people you dont make one of the best love stories ever about two people connecting in the first book then kill the girl and in the second book ruin it all by giving him anothere girl! Bi** i was freaking the hell out! I say the only part in the epilogue that I actually liked is what they named the baby! I was crying a river. Well now that i got all my this out i will give the first book a 4.5 stars, the only thing i didn't like was that eventually the most epic romance story came to an end when the girl dide. This book, well i just give this book a damn 4 cause bitch no one and i mean no one messes up my feelings that hard and goes putting another girl and making Chase marry her! Overall i love this author and adore her work with books.

When I first saw there was a sequel to Chasing Nikki, I was convinced there was nothing the author could do to make me accept the loss that occurred in Chasing Nikki and fall in love with someone else. I repeat nothing. Now that I've finished reading Finding Chase, I realize I was very wrong. And after reading the author's note at the end of Finding Chase, I realize why. In a sense, Lacey Weatherford \"is\" Chase. The author experienced a tragic loss; she also found love again. I don't think anyone else could have written this story and made it work except for Lacey Weatherford. The reason I was able to move past the heartbreaking loss that occurred in Chasing Nikki was because of how delicately the author built Brittney and Chase's relationship in Finding Chase. She completely exposed their mutual feelings of loss, grief and guilt. Only someone who has experienced such a painful loss could write the real, honest emotions that were shared throughout this novel.Finding Chase was a beautiful, bittersweet conclusion to the Chasing Nikki series. I STRONGLY recommend Chasing Nikki and Finding Chase, but in all honesty, I don't recommend reading both novels back-to-back. Personally, I think readers need a break in between books to let their heart mend. I know I did.Lacey,From the bottom of my heart, I'm sorry for the tragic losses you have survived. You've created two beautiful, heart-wrenching stories from your experience. Thank you for sharing your story with us.MorganI gave Finding Chase (Chasing Nikki #2) by Lacey Weatherford 4 STARS.

How Chase starts to accept what his loss means to him in the longterm. That even though you have lost someone, that it is ok to fall in love again.

I am glad that she find her true love after a devastating previous relationship. I am happy for Chase for finding love once again. It's just... You know... I stick to the first MC, I love her and all that, so I'm loyal to the first MC... That it's a bit hard to accept that. I also know that it's totally okay to love another person. I mean, personally if I knew someone who experience that, I don't want him/her wallowing it up and crying always. I would want him/her to be happy once again. I just got attached to Nikki that much that I really don't want Brittney for Chase. Yes, she's good and all.

Let me start off by saying I started this at around 8:30 in the morning and I finished it at noon that very same day. TODAY. Literally. I just kept going. There was no stopping me...I was tore to pieces while I read this. It was so heartbreaking at the end of the last one, I just wanted happy things for this one. I laughed, got sad, stayed happy for the long hall, and then DIED, then giggled from happiness. There were so many mixed emotions here!I had to quickly start reading this story after I finished the first one last night. I HAD to know what happened next. I needed to understand where Chase went from there. So, I bought the book and started promptly! Happy to continue.It was hard to read about him being so lost and sad... He deserved to be happy but he wouldn't let himself. It was tragic, and I understand. But... Chase was such an amazing person that he needed someone that could change his life once again. So, from just the first few chapters, I could see it building. I saw him changing and seeing change in himself. He started to allow himself to be happy again. It was beautiful. I just kept cheering him on as the story went. He finally found love once more. It was another beautiful love story. They had a connection that no one could understand. Yes, it was a beautiful love story, yes it was tragic how they were brought together, but some how I felt it made their love deeper and more meaningful. I loved watching them grow and just become happy once again.Then the author nearly killed me, AGAIN, with a slight twist in the story. I literally had to read it over a few times before I grasped what was happening. I couldn't understand why it was happening or what made the author think it was okay to allow that to happen again! I wanted to start crying. I was like NO, you cannot open old wounds like that! I saw it coming during one of their cute dates... and I said to myself, if this happens I may die right now. I couldn't handle what was about to happen. Then it happened, I cried, made sure I what I was reading was true, died a little, but I kept reading. I'll tell you I cheered with joy after that. It does have a beautiful ending, with such an AWWWWWW ending and epilogue. It seemed to happen so quickly, and I know some would judge this, but I see the beauty in it and I adored it for that. No spoilers! I'll just tell you it's lovely. The way it happened was truly romantic. Then the ending to the epilogue; AW!! So sweet. Beautiful!Overall, I'd say I'm happy with the way this ended. I died a few times, cried a few times, but I would definitely say to add this to your to-read list. It's a quick read, beautiful, emotional, and worth the emotional roller coaster :)I'm so happy for Chase Walker <3"}, {"userName": "Kirsty", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10389044-kirsty", "userReview": "Don't read this review unless you have read Chasing Nikki!3.5 Stars.Edit: After thinking about it I feel I need to change my star and add a bit more..I really wish we had seen more of Nikki's family towards the end. Chase was always talking about how close they were, yet we never found out how Justine and the two kids felt about Chase's new relationship. I'm sure they would have been happy to see him happy, but we just never knew. I finished Chasing Nikki in absolute floods of tears, it tore me apart. I knew it would be sad but I wasn't prepare enough for it. Once it ended I almost wished that had been all, I felt uncomfortable with the story moving on. I loved Chase and Nikki and didn't like the idea of him moving on, even though I knew he had to. Chase has been through complete and utter hell in his short life, the most recent of which, was losing his girlfriend in a car accident. After all the hurt he had been through he had to find a way to love again and in a good way, without alcohol and drugs. Without his friends, Chase never would have gotten through it. His friend Brittney in particular helped him more than anything, and this is where I had an issue.Brittney was best friends with Chase and Nikki so when a relationship started to form between Chase and herself I was uncomfortable. But giving the author credit, she did a good job. None of it felt rushed and every issue each character had I totally understood. They were concerned what it would mean to be together and they talked through their issues. It was a welcomed change. I loved the epilogue, I guess it was bitter sweet. Before I got to the last sentence though I'd pretty much guessed what was going to happen so I didn't necessarily like that predictability. The very ending though is what, once again, tore me apart. It was a note from the author explaining where the idea from this series came from and I had no idea what I was about to read. It really hurt my heart to read. Lacey, I think you are wonderful for sharing this story."}, {"userName": "Hannah Lane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2773854-hannah-lane", "userReview": "[-The major issues I had came attached to the ending...I wasn't a fan of the car accident Brittney was in. I know, it added drama, but I was rolling my eyes the entire time. I knew there was no way she'd put Chase through that again, so it was kind of useless. I felt like it was only there to add one more spike to the drama before the last page. The minute I read that there's a car to be won, all I could think was...\"Sweet Lord, she's going to crash it\". So that plotline was kind of a drag for me. -On that same note, I wasn't a fan of the proposal. I know, I'm glad they eventually got married, but seriously? Freshmen year in college? Maybe it's because I've had friends married that young that are now divorced, but I think that's just crazy. And the baby with the name Nikki was kind of cheesy. I know, I have no heart.

Chasing Nikki didnt quite get me to a happy place although i loved it. I was overwhelmed by Finding Chase. I read this book and its sequel in one day....both books in the same day. I want to support this author and encourage others to read these fabulous books, but she makes it hard to write a review without spoilers. Lacey did an outstanding job connecting the readers with the emotions of a male teen. I have to say I am so glad that the sequel was ready for me to read right away. I suggest you take a chance on Chase and read both Chasing Nikki and Finding Chase. Yes it is a mature young adult book, but it is a book that can help open dialogue between kids and parents. It reassures us parents that even when we arent looking, if we have given our children the right foundation, they will make good choices. It also gives us hope that if our children deviate from the straight and narrow path they can find their way back. Both books are emotional roller coasters and i needed kleenex at several points in both books. Go meet Chase and return to the emotional times of high school and college."}, {"userName": "Amanda Sheila", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11886105-amanda-sheila", "userReview": "I'm crying (again) because Chase is nothing but stole my heart. Well done, Miss Weatherford. After losing Nikki, Chase's devastated. But he didn't waste his life with drugs like he used to. He got scholarship for football and he become the golden boy in college. But inside, he's empty. He needs Nikki. That's when Brittney, Brett's twin sister starts stealing his attention. He felt guilty, he didn't want to betray Nikki's memory by falling for other girl. But Brittney's so tender and honest, Chase can't stop thinking about her.. One thing that bother me is, there's no continuing for Chase's grandpa. I mean, I kind of expecting his grandpa would call him everyday but apparently no. That's okay though. I'm satisfied for what it is. ;) Even though I didn't really fond of Britt mostly because I still stuck with Nikki, but she's perfect for Chase. She's caring and sweet and I like her for taking care of Chase. The story of Miss Weatherford, one in the back, is killing me. My heart's breaking for Mike and I hope no matter where he is, he'd be happy for you, Miss Weatherford. Definitely 5 stars and beyond.

I cried reading both story and I cried even more reading Lacey's story. Lacey you are Brilliant and i will keep on saying that I truly love these books. I admired your courage thru the lowest times of your life and admired your husband for staying beside you while you go thru with your emotions with obvious love and understanding. At first I was reluctant to the idea of Britney and Chase but as the story goes I see the way she helped Chase take one step at a time to healing and letting her go. The dream he had is powerful and i do believe that it can happen for real. Im glad both Chase and Lacey came out of this story with a happy ending.

Finding Chase was such a meh book that I don't know how anyone can give it more than 2 stars. Maybe everyone who did was friends with the author or something. Don't know, or maybe I've been exposed to better prose. For an author who writes about her own personal experiences, her writing lacks fundamental depth. You know Chase has gone through major trauma in life but I couldn't really feel his pain. The scenes and his inner dialogues felt hollow. The lack of originality and weak plot device showed me that this book wasn't done with much thought or consideration. I'm sure that it took a lot of work to put it together but it doesn't show and that is just sad. It seems that Lacey was in a hurry to continue Chase's story and didn't give herself enough time to write a strong sequel. So Finding Chase is nothing more than an empty book without a soul."}, {"userName": "Patty Belongs To Kellan~Jesse~Lautner~Miller~Jack~Racer~Rafe~Liam~Prince Nicholas~Hayes~Simon~Gianluca & Archer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14302918-patty-belongs-to-kellan-jesse-lautner-miller-jack-racer-rafe-liam-prince", "userReview": "Finding Chase was the perfect sequel!!I couldn't stop the tears in the beginning of the book.All I wanted to do was hug Chase!\"My heart is stuck with you.
