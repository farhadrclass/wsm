Needless to say, I was excited to see the book on the book shelf at the store and had high expectations.While the it would never be able to fully capture how incredible it is to see those kids play their hearts out, it does as best it can to paint the picture for people to read. I read it long enough ago that I don't remember specific details about it - but I do recall that it provided a perspective into the league and the teams that you can't get being an outsider and from sitting in the stands, and an idea of the activity surrounding the teams, players and scouts.A great read, especially for anyone interested in baseball."}, {"userName": "Megan O'Neill", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6948563-megan-o-neill", "userReview": "There's something magical about the experience of walking into a baseball park. Jim Collins' The Last Best League: One Summer, One Season, One Dream understands that magic, and it magnifies it. As he chronicles the 2002 Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League, the reader is transported to the games in question, fleshed out in just enough detail to be vivid, and becomes attached to this young, effusive, and dream-filled group of guys. When the book reaches the end of the season, there's a real sense of sadness that the journey is over, a sensation not unlike the one felt as the last moments of your favorite team's season drift away. To be honest, I'm not sure I can even begin to describe properly the beauty of this book; I can only say that Collins' work is lyrical, fluid, and full of a love of the sport without being cliche, cloying, and overly-sentimental. It's a must-read for any baseball fan.You might say it's a home run."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11277032-thomas", "userReview": "This is a special book. Every once in awhile I come across a book which generally makes you feel happy after reading it. For me this fell under that category (Although I understand many others won't have this same impression) I think that I enjoyed this book so much because I love baseball and this was not one of those baseball books such as Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Gamethat was not really about baseball. This is a book that baseball lovers will LOVE but casual fans may not. I liked how the book gave a perspectaive of the game from not only professional players but also players on the verge of that stardom. During the book I felt a connection with the featured players in this book and I think that the author really allowed that to happen.

In this book, Jim Collins follows one team, the Chatham A's, for the entire 2002 season. We get to know some of the personalities on the team: Jamie D'Antona from Wake Forest, Tim Stauffer from University of Richmond, Tom Pauly from Princeton, to name a few, and hear their thoughts on baseball, the stresses of being a college athlete, their hopes & dreams as they grow over this summer. We also get a look inside the communities that host the players every summer and how the Cape Cod League has shaped the residents.

The Last Best League is a Non-Fiction Book set in Chatham, MA, on Cape Cod, and The Chatham A\u2019s 2002 Baseball Season. The A\u2019s compete in the Cape Cod League, a Collegiate Summer Baseball League featuring the best college players in the country. The Last Best League is focused on the entire A\u2019s especially Ace Tim Stauffer, home run hitting third baseman Jamie D\u2019antona and longtime manager John Schiffner. Along with his managerial duties, Schiffner is also responsible for all of the A\u2019s recruiting. He has built strong relationships with coaches from Wake Forest and Richmond University among others. Schiffner later recruited MLB All-Stars Matt Harvey, Kris Bryant and Evan Longoria. I thought the book was interesting because Jim Collins provides a unique perspective on the life of college baseball players and on a league I did not know anything about upon reading this book. Collins also reflects on talking to Schiffner on the tough task of recruiting good players. One thing that I dislike in The Last Best League is that it\u2019s not a good \u201cBathroom Book\u201d. The book has long chapters and goes back and forth on different players and their day jobs and backgrounds. I also feel that Collins gave some unfair airtime to certain players who appeared more in the book. I also think that Collins wrote more on some players in the early parts of the book and mentions them later in the book and I have no recollection of who they are. I recommend this book to people who are looking for a good non-fiction baseball book. This book is one of my all-time favorites and receive a 5 out of 5!"}, {"userName": "Sean Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5052531-sean-kelly", "userReview": "The Last Best League is essentially a summer the author spent embedded with the Chatham A's (grammatical error here to represent the way the team actually spells their logo) of the Cape Cod league in 2002. Future major leaguers populate this summer league, and Collins takes the reader through the lifestyle, hopes, dreams, and disappointments of some of the best young college ball players in the country. Some particular points of interest are the networks the coaches have to cultivate to recruit players, the players living and working arrangements and schedules, and the decided lack of non-white players in the league. It is possible that last part has changed in 15 years, but it seemed that the league definitely did not represent the overall ethnic profile of major league baseball. There are also some interesting anecdotes about overinvolved parents, greasy agents, and some of the life-altering decisions facing these young players. I found the book well-written and interesting, with plenty of background for most of the anecdotes contained within."}, {"userName": "Jimf", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69790386-jimf", "userReview": "I have read many baseball books, none capture the true essence of the game and the struggles of those trying to make it than this book.

This book is written by Jim Collins. His purpose for writing this book was to tell the story about the infamous 2002 Cape Cod Baseball League the Chatham Angels. To play on this team is what really helped these young men looking to further their career in baseball all the way to the major leagues. He wanted to show us the differences between high school baseball, college baseball, summer leagues, and the major leagues. He also tells about how some baseball players struggled from using a metal or composite bat in college then having to use wooden baseball bats in the cape league and in the major leagues. It is a whole lot easier for a player to hit with a composite bat because the ball just flies off of the bat so much farther. Also a composite bat allows the batter to make larger margins of error rather than with a wooden bat. The Cape Cod League is the best of the best baseball players. These coaches scout so many players and this is just for the Cape League. They put a lot of work into molding their rosters into a winning team, but you do not always get your first pick of players. Then the scouts come to most of the games to see who they want to bring up to the majors.The theme of The Last Best League is life does not always go your way. In fact I would say that nine times out of ten life does not go the way that you plan. Well the boys on the Chatham Angels had the big dream like every other young boy has. They all wanted to play in the major leagues. They wanted to play the game that they loved the most as a job when they are older. These boys could not think of any other way they would want their lives to play out. What all of these boys did not realize when they were younger was all of the blood, sweat, and tears that it was going to take to finally be playing with the best of the best in the majors in front of the whole world. Almost half of the team probably would not even make it to the minors. Then there would be your select few that would make it all of the way. Those would be your players that just have the raw talent and love for the game. They would also be the ones who put in the most work on and off of the field. I liked The Last Best League a lot more than I thought I would. It really let me see what the world of major league baseball was like. Let me tell it is not easy to get into the major leagues. I am really into softball and I completely understand what these players are going through with all of the stress to perform at their highest level of ability and hoping that it is enough to make it to the next level. I would definitely recommend this book to someone else who loves baseball and also to those who dream of playing on the next level. This book could really give them some insight of what it is going to take to accomplish their dream of playing in the majors or any other sport."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11827992-mike", "userReview": "Jim Collins is one of the great storytellers of our time, one mark of which is the ability to tell, in an interesting way, a story in which the reader (or listener) might ordinarily assume he would have no interest. I still recall, many years ago now, reading an article he wrote for the US Airways in-flight magazine on the subject of glass-making, one that I started out of boredom and finished because I was fascinated. (Yes, I pay attention to by-lines; articles, like books, do not write themselves.) My point? If he can write an engaging article on glass-making, rest assured, he can write a thoroughly delightful book on the subject of baseball.Though the narrative tells the story of a single season of (arguably) the most-storied team of the Cape Cod League, the Chatham A\u2019s, the brilliance of this book is in the way that Collins, without one entirely realizing it, tells us about baseball. For example, in the middle of a crucial plate appearance for Jamie D\u2019Antona, he breaks into a scholarly disquisition on the history of bat-making, the relative advantages of various types of wood, the evolution of aluminum bats, and the rationale for the \u201cradical\u201d decision by the Cape Cod League to stick with wooden bats. Throughout the book Collins interweaves into the narrative stories of this sort, always with the pitch-perfect timing of a storyteller, someone versed in the oral tradition. (For those of you contemplating the book, I will use this as an opportunity to send you, as well, to audible.com for Collins\u2019 marvelous reading of his own book.) And, yes, the story he tells, even for those with no real interest in baseball (I have no real interest in glass-making) makes for a book that is difficult to put down.Reader interest lies not only in Collins\u2019 ability to tell a story well; in the book, he tells the very human story of a score of young men pursuing their dreams, even those who know that the dream is being snatched away as water from Tantalus. His ability to tell the human side of the story rests on the respect in which he holds these young men and the dozens of people who support them, even when painting an honest but unflattering picture. Anyone doubtful of that trust should be persuaded otherwise by the afterward chapters Collins has written for this tenth anniversary edition; he is able to follow up with these people (both one year and ten years) only because he has remained in touch with them over the years. In the absence of the trust that mutual respect engenders, there is no possibility of follow-up - nor any interest on the writers\u2019 part. I bought the book because I wanted to hear the end of the story, but re-read it in entirety because it is worth a second read. I chose to listen via audible.com because I was, rightly, confident that Collins\u2019 reading would enhance my experience of it. Whether this is your first time through, or your second, do not hesitate to read this book. Your time will be well-spent."}, {"userName": "Molly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1341512-molly", "userReview": "I wasn't sure how to rate this non-fiction book, which follows the Chatham A's of the top amateur Cape Cod Baseball League in the summer of 2002. On the one hand, I loved the topic/subject matter. On the other hand, I was disappointed in the way it was covered. So I guess 2.5 stars would be more appropriate than 3. It seemed to me that Collins vacillated between descriptive passages that worked to embellish the scene and play by play notations and technical details that blurred my eyes. I wish he could have made them work together more smoothly.There is a section in the back listing the names of players on the team that signed with the MLB - this would have been a perfect spot for a list of the full Chatham A's 2002 Roster - maybe even with pictures. It would have made it easier to follow along with all of the players and volunteers and coaching staff that drop in and out of the book.Collins begins this book by showing us 3 young men and how they got to be top amateur college baseball players in the country and their path to the Cape Cod League. This is a great start. Then we are introduced to the Manager of the Chatham A's - the dominant team each summer. From there Collins drops in names randomly throughout and gets away from the 3 main players he set the stage with. This is because he spends some time detailing the particulars of the action in a lot of games and that brings up all the other players on the team. So then he tells bits and pieces of the other players' stories. He comes back to the main 3 throughout but I kept losing track of who was who. At the very end he closes with the original 3 players to let us know how things fared for them and their college/professional careers.He provides nice insight about how the teams are put together each year, how the league is run as well as how it came to be and evolved. He sets the scenes very well and makes you want to head right to Chatham to take in a game. He puts you in the minds of these 20 year olds and how they balance reality with dreams. But when he gets away from the 3 main players and their Manager that he chose to focus on, the nicely formed book rambles off on a lot of tangents that, while interesting, take away from the type of book he seems to have set up to write."}, {"userName": "Caidin Stash", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13507774-caidin-stash", "userReview": "The last best league was an incredible book. this book talks about the cape cod league and the great things that happen there, but it also talks about the struggles of playing in the cape cod league. The author was trying to push the fact that its not just about baseball its about how you handle your self when the going gets tough, weather your in a slump in the field or off the field you just have to keep battling. The theme of this book is no matter what happens keep fighting because whatever is on the end is all ways worth fighting for. These guys are going through slumps and girl problems but they don't back down they go to the cages or go talk to that girl but they don't quit or back now. If a pitcher has a bad game he shakes it off and gets ready for his next start thats what the theme of this book is. Jim collins wrote in a exposition style,he also wrote about A lot of people in this book but the main 3 were Pauly, D'Antona, and Stauffer.He went through and discussed the mechanics of each of these players and the slumps they are going through and what they can d to fix them and impress the major league scouts. He also talks about the change from metal bats to wood bats and the difference it is hitting with the two. His style of writing can sometimes be boring to people but i find it very intriguing the way he goes into to details like when talking about mechanics he says everything there is to do not all writers do that. I loved this book this one of my favorite books i have ever read. If you love baseball you will enjoy this book. I have always dreamed of playing in the cape cod league getting scouted by all MLB scouts every game knowing that at the end of the summer you could be signing a contract to play the game of baseball and get payed. This book also describes the trouble which i can understand you go through tough times but all these guys in the book battled through and i think it would help me battle through stuff like this if i could just think back to the book. this is defiantly one of the best books i have ever read"}, {"userName": "Brent Lady", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12731817-brent-lady", "userReview": "summaryThis book is based around the famous Cape Cod baseball league. This is the baseball league players dream to play in. The Cape Cod baseball league is the link between high school/college baseball and professional baseball. Some of the alumni of this league are even in the baseball hall of fame. This book follows amateur baseball players as they try to make a name for themselves in this league. Every player comes from a different background, and has a different story. The main team the book follows is the dominant Chatman A\u2019s. With how much pressure is on these athletes to perform at such a high level, there is a lot of drama. Some athletes get looked at by the major league scouts while others are blown off. Some of the players go beyond their breaking point and quit, while other players turn into stars with multi-million dollar contracts. Who might be interested in this book? Why?Of course any sports lover (not just baseball) would absolutely love this book because it shows the grind that athletes go through that are trying to make it professionally. Also, any reader that enjoys triumphant and happy endings would like this book. Any reader that likes drama, tension, and pressure-filled situations would like this because things are very stressed in this book. This book is also a easy and quick read so that\u2019s a good thing. People who get confused and don\u2019t pay attention during books will get lost and forget what\u2019s going on. You learn a lot of players names and you have to be able to remember them to get the book.Overall SatisfactionI was very close to giving this book five stars. I don\u2019t think there is any other book similar to this one about the Cape Cod baseball league. This book was very interesting and very detailed. It was interesting following each players lives individually as well as following the teams journey. The only thing I didn't love about this book was it would switch players without specifically telling you that it changed the setting or thought. This caused some confusion for me."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/184521-john", "userReview": "Always good to get the baseball books in during May and June. Autumn is not typically the best time for these, unless your team is fortuitously making a pennant run. But in the spring, even the crappy teams still technically have a shot. Even my Red Sox, in the midst of a lose ten, win seven, lose five shrug of mediocrity. They could still put it together.This made me really want to drive down to the cape and take in a few games, and luckily I live in a place where I actually can do that. I've never been to a cape league game, but I love college summer leagues. I've been to games in New Hampshire, Rhode Island, North Carolina. Sometimes they play in historic old parks with old wooden grandstands, and the tickets are like four bucks and the baseball is great. Plus there is less crap going on all through the game, like in the minor pro leagues.This book also made me think about how skewed our perceptions of ballplayers can be. Part of it is reading this a decade after it was written, so you can look up all these guys featured in the book and see how they did. A few have had some decent big league time, but mostly they fizzled out in the minors. But back in college and on the cape, they were amazing. It's crazy to think of how many players just tear it up their whole lives and then get to the pros and can't hit, can't pitch. Every time you roll your eyes at someone hitting .180 and say, jesus, this guy is the worst shortstop in the history of baseball, that guy was the greatest thing anyone had ever seen on every other team he played on.The only thing I didn't like about this was that some of the people came off as kind of jerks. The ballplayers I can sort of understand, they were 19 year old kids, after all. They just wanted to drink and get laid and play baseball all summer, and what can we expect from 19 year olds? But the coaches also came off as jerks sometimes, insulting their players behind their backs and being obnoxious for no reason. You'd think the author would have edited that stuff out. I still want to go and watch some baseball on the cape though."}, {"userName": "Joel Niermann", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59604711-joel-niermann", "userReview": "When reading the book The Last Best League: One Summer, One Season, One Dream it really inspired me to read more and more of it. The book focuses on three boys named Jamie, Thomas, and Tim. This book is about The Cape Cod baseball League. Every summer the best of the best college baseball playes get to face one another. They all are wanting to be noticed by profeshional baseball scouts. Over the summer the three boys face competition, loyalty, and themselves. Jim Collins is entertaining the readers throughout this amazing story.The theme of the book The Last Best League is respect all but fear none. What Jim Collins means by this is always respect your opponent but don't ever overlook or turn down your enemy. Throughout the book Jamie, Thomas, and Tim look out for one another. Collins tries to tie the protagonists by relating them to brothers. Sometimes they get mad at each other but they always make up at the end.The style of the book Collins writes is narration. Jim Collins breaks down every player, coach, and volunteer on what they do and how they do it. He talks about everything they do wrong and everything they do right. In the book he describes them in everyway amaginable to what they wear to what they think. Jim Collins form of writing is very effective.I really enjoyed the book The Last Best Season. I liked how the characters connected to one another. Towards the end of the book it seemed like they got so close that they could read each other minds. If I could changed anything about this book it would be narration. I think the book would be better if the book was told by one of the characters.

The author of this book is Jim Collins. This book is a sports book, its especially a baseball book. He was writing this book to all the baseball lovers out there. Jim is obviously a person who likes baseball, because he must of put a lot of time and effort into this book due to the details you could picture in your head. The main character in this book is Jamie D'Antona, he plays a big role in this team. When he shows up for practice he knows he's in the right place due to the fact of how good the team was and the coach welcoming him to the Chatam A's. In the bullpen they had guys throwing hard and accurately. Jim took his time to try and have you imagine what Jamie was feeling when he walked onto the field. He wanted you to feel the excitement. Jim was able to give you a little hint about what was coming in the near future. The team in this book is called the Chatam A's they, the team is made up of people from all over the place, the teams they face have players from all over the place. They are competing for a championship at the end of the season, just like the pros would in the Major Leagues.  If you love sports this is definitely the book for you.

I found the book to be very repetitious because the author tried to get every single detail in, making the book unnecessarily long and becoming bromidic. If you take out all the unimportant details in the book it is very interesting because it goes through a typical day of Jamie D'Antona, a college baseball player at Wake Forest, at the end of his college season trying to make it into the college World Series and into the summer Cape League. I also feel that I would not have finished the book if I didn't know that he lived in Connecticut and played for the same travel team that i currently play for, Team Connecticut Baseball(it doesn't say this in the book, but he has won several awards and is on a lot of national championship banners). This book is similar to the book Born To Play by Dustin Pedroia because it gives you a very good description of what is like to be playing baseball in college and how competitive it is among your own team fighting for positions, starting roles, and playing time much like it is for any competitive team. For example, Jamie is in the Cape Cod All-Star game playing in front of scouts from all the major league baseball teams and at practice the coach said that only the kids that hustled the most would play. I cant really spoil the book for you because it is a biography, but at the end he gets drafted but is now playing for a team in Japan."}, {"userName": "Jim Kulhawy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4093329-jim-kulhawy", "userReview": "Tremendous read on the Chatham A's 2002 season in the Cape Cod Baeball League. I had head many wonderful things about the Cape League and finally got to expirience a game there this summer with some great friends. For those of you that do not know, the Cape League is THE pre-eminant baseball leage in the country for college kids who have not yet been drafted, and signed, by a MLB team. This league differes from college baseball due to the fact that it is a wood bat league, as baseball should be. The one thing that I HATE about college ball is the aluminum bats. You never hear anyone talk about the \"ping\" of the bat, it's always the CRACK of the bat. This book shows exactly what it's like to be a college kid, living away from home, expirienceing wood bats for, likely, the first time. These kids are generally the best of the best of their college teams, so the competition is fierce as they try to impress the MLB scouts and up their draft slot, or draft slot monies. Many star MLB players have spent time on The Cape, such as Mark Teixeira, Thurman Munson, Time Lincecum, David Eckstein Jason Giambi and many, many others. This book is HIGHLY recommended to those that want to see what it's like to be a college kid, living away from home with a host family, working to make his dream a reality."}, {"userName": "Mike Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7352820-mike-kennedy", "userReview": "This is a really cool look into one of the top summer college baseball leagues in the country.

It was interesting to see how the coaches tried to balance their instruction to what college coaches, scouts, and players wanted. I found it interesting to read this book years after it was published, so you could see how the players turned out. Of the players followed, they all had interesting careers including one making the majors as a relief pitcher/spot started and one playing in Japan. It just goes to show how tough it is to make it to the show. The funny thing is the best player on the team as far as major league success, wasn't ever covered in the book.....Ryan Braun.

The player profiles were well done and the descriptions of the parks and Cape Cod itself make one want to visit. I knocked off one star because once in a while the descriptions became too technical. The differences between wood or aluminum bats comes to mind. I read the 10th anniversary edition which had updates on where all the players ended up. That was a welcome follow up, it saved me the time of having to look them up myself."}, {"userName": "Ari", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1977181-ari", "userReview": "Collins gets it. Baseball people have a certain way about them, and Collins obviously is one of them; he also knows how to write about them. This book\u2014an in-depth and endearing look at the 2002 Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League\u2014shines with the polish of good baseball writing about a great baseball subject. The players and team staff come to life, as does the ebb and flow of a summer on the cape. The poignancy of this moment in time, in these specific lives and in this specific baseball season, got me a little misty-eyed at the end. These are the kinds of dreams everyone should have, at least once in awhile, even when they have to come to an end. This is such a big part of why I love baseball.Also a reminder of how difficult it is to make it to the highest level, in any field, and the work, dedication, competition, ambition and good luck that it requires."}, {"userName": "Larry Kirby Sullivan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22873706-larry-kirby-sullivan", "userReview": "Have you ever dreamt of making it in the \"bigs\"? This book is a great look into one of the last best amateur gateways to playing professional baseball in the MLB. A well researched and witnessed look at a season of a team in the Cape Cod summer baseball league. Granted I have read the book on vacation in Cape Cod, but this is a thoroughly enjoyable look at the way the whole thing works. The addition of a second afterword, chronicling what happened to the teammates another 10 years after the original afterward's covering of the following year's draft shows the greatness of the dream reached and the importance of the lives lived outside the sport. Three stars for writing that was a little uneven, but highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Tom Gase", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2339366-tom-gase", "userReview": "A good book about the Cape Cod baseball league on the East Coast that takes place in the summer of 2002. I've now read three minor league baseball books in the last month or two, and this one was the second best (Bottom of the 33rd being the best, and Odd Man Out being the worst) of the three I've read. I liked the players better in this book, especially Tim Stauffer, who is now with the Padres, and Jamie D'Antonia. Not that much about the actual games compared to the other two books, but more about these players dreams and also what life is like in town for the Chatham A's, the team the book profiles. Author Jim Collins does a good job and it's a pretty quick read. I recommend for baseball fans and especially fans of the Cape Cod baseball league."}, {"userName": "Steve Bennett", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6708700-steve-bennett", "userReview": "This book is a good summer read for a baseball fan. The book follows the Chatham A's during the 2002 season of the Cape Cod Summer League. The players are mostly some of the best 20 year old amatuer collegiate players who are vying to be drafted by MLB teams. It is the last best season because the players will either soon be drafted by a major league team and start a professional career or undrafted and soon be out of the baseball life. Well written book that fortunately escapes some of the excesses of other authors who write glorifying paeans of the innocence and timelessness of the summer game well past the point of embarrassment. Reading this book while at the beach in Cape May was more than appropriate. I had fun reading this book. High praise indeed."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3901808-brian", "userReview": "Baseball is likely my favorite hobby, and living so close to Cape Cod, when my fiancee picked up this book I had to read it. I think Collins does an excellent job of reaching for the larger theme (the last chance that these 20 year old baseball players get to just have fun before turning pro while also assessing where they fall in the hierarchy of baseball skills) without being oppressive about it. I felt like I really got to know the young men playing for the Chatham As in 2002, and Collins was remarkable in giving a real look at not only how they played baseball, but how they lived during their summer."}, {"userName": "Gary Land", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3349296-gary-land", "userReview": "The Last Best League is an account of one season of the Cape Cod League, the premier college baseball summer league. Written by a journalist rather than a participant, it is similar to Odd Man Out in its depiction of young men with dreams of reaching the majors testing themselves against the best talent they have ever encountered. Collins does a wonderful job of portraying the athletes, their coaches, and the townspeople. What is most refreshing is that this league is purely amateur, the highest level of play before professionalism begins to make its inroads. Someday, I hope to attend a Cape Cod game. Perhaps that desire is the best testament to this book."}, {"userName": "Nnhslibrarygmail.com", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12515191-nnhslibrarygmail-com", "userReview": "Student Review: BellaI am usually not one for non-fiction/ biography type books, but I really enjoyed this one. \"The Last Best League\" is based off of a Cape Cod baseball summer league, the Chatham A's. The author focuses on the lives, and challenges of specific players on the team. Each player has an inspiring and interesting story, beginning with their middle and/or high school baseball career, their challenges/ falling outs, as well as their successes in baseball, and after baseball life. Reading this book made me feel like it was summer down the cape all over again. I always looked forward to coming home and learning more about each character. I highly recommend this book!"}], "description": "Every summer, in ten small towns across Cape Cod, the finest college baseball players in the country gather in hopes of making it to \u201cThe Show.\u201d The hopes are justifiably high: The Cape Cod Baseball League is the best amateur league in the world, producing one out of every six major league players, from Nomar Garciaparra and Frank Thomas to Jeff Bagwell and Barry Zito.Jim Collins chronicles a season in the life of one team\u2014the Chatham A\u2019s, perhaps the most celebrated team in the league. Set against the backdrop of a resort town on the bend of the outer Cape, the story charts the changing fortunes of a handful ?of players battling slumps and self-doubt in their effort to make the league playoffs and, more importantly, impress the major league scouts.We learn about everything from the physics of wooden bats and the physiology of elbows to the psychology of slumps and the lure of drugs. In the course of a single dramatic season, with euphoric wins and devastating losses, we come to know the intricacies of the major league scouting network and the rapidly changing profile of major league baseball.In the tradition of The Boys of Summer, The Last Best League is about dreams fulfilled and dreams denied, about Cape Cod and the rites of summer, and about the way one small town grows to love a group of young men coming of age in America.", "title": "The Last Best League: One Summer, One Season, One Dream", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119747.The_Last_Best_League", "average": 4.06, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442696111l/119747.jpg", "reviews": 88, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2999510.Jim_Collins", "name": "Jim  Collins"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2999517.James_Maddison_Collins", "name": "James Maddison Collins"}], "type": ["Sports", "Sports and Games", "Nonfiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119747.The_Last_Best_League", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/947817.The_Last_Best_League", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7492040-bring-on-the-books-for-everybody", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/767444.Film_Theory_Goes_to_the_Movies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3194255-the-berumda-triangle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/434992.Uncommon_Cultures", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1233789.High_Pop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
