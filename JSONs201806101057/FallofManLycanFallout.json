This was such a great book, it was hard to put down. So since I also got the audible at the same time, I switched back and forth when I had other things to do. No I didn't get lost because everything was so well synchronized with both the audible and the book that it was easy to go from one to the other. And Sean Runnette once again has done a great job narrating and capturing our favorite half-vamp. Due to the events of the last book, this one is a tad darker but still great. The one liners TALBOT fans are used to just keep coming. WOW! This is just the latest example why Mark Tufo is one of the best Indie horror writers out there. Mark Tufo has once again given his loyal fan base everything we asked for in this latest installment of LF series! Talbot's mood after having lost Tommy has changed and his reluctance to get involved in the Lycan/human war has taken a darker twist as vengeance fills his grieving heart. Only Oggie keeps him somewhat sane. Bailey stands by him but it is plain to see she is still somewhat confused by Talbot (slight spoiler) and a little worried as she watches Talbot's humanity begin to slowly slip away. But she has other things to worry about, foremost is the safety of her village. Unfortunately they become separated and she returns to her village believing in his demise. Azile is still trying to find a way to unite the people in the area to face the coming battle between Lycan and human. But Man has not changed and power, even in the face of impending doom, is still foremost in the other towns leadership mind and Talboton is in their crosshairs. You will not be disappointed as we follow Michael Talbot through adventures and misadventures that has kept us at the edge of our seat throughout the ZF series. Talbot is still Talbot, that will never change, no matter how out of time and place he is or how angry, morose, sad or depressed he becomes. He still cuts loose with his one liners that will leave the reader in stiches even as those around him have no idea what he is talking about. And he finds a new friend, Mathieu, who has just as tragic a past but during his own self imposed isolation has managed to find a way to brew beer, and this will play a very important part in the telling of this tale. Lana and Azile are still competing against each other for his affections and makes for interesting and in some cases hilarious situations. The battle scenes are intense and will leave you breathless as Michael unleashes his inner demon and is just as easily brought to tears by a simple reunion. He's as complicated a man as he is easy to understand. Mark Tufo has woven a tale that will keep you at the edge of your seat, lets you fall then has you clamoring for more as you pick yourself up at the mention of other characters hinted at briefly (don't blink or you will miss the references) and other more sinister enemies that can only add to the already intense tale"}, {"userName": "Shawn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7027982-shawn", "userReview": "Mark Tufo really never fails to put together a solid humaorous, action story.

His internal and usually external Talbotisms still reign supreme! Even amongst the gore (and there is a lot) and the heartache (again a lot) I still had moments where I literally snorted or laughed out loud at the one liners. Loved the little flash backs to the old life. Bear\u2026..that is all.It is soon obvious that not all is well in the realm of the Lycans, Xavier\u2019s plans are not liked by all; many have gone rogue. The werewolf change scenes are impressive and the fight scenes terrifying, I found myself holding my breath.Matheiu. There is an element of ZardOz to his home.Baily and Azile are still high profile but in the background.The watchers are also back as the Lycans mount their attack on the townships. Each town doing as man usually does though which is really rather sadAny old enemy rears its head but not for long\u2026.The finale is amazing, the last few paragraphs had me in both stitches and tears, glad to see Trip is his usual self; yes he makes an appearance but not how you think! Whilst fishing for beavers of the coast of Kansas could be fun, what I really want to know is do ants fart??"}, {"userName": "Kelly Rickard", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15385541-kelly-rickard", "userReview": "Fall of manTufo is getting bleak, but still the great story telling is here. Talbot is still the same great character with the great one liners but no trip in any form well maybe but not in this universe hehe. Talbot is with Oggie, Bailey and Azile no Tommy (he didn't come back like I was hoping, damn you Tufo), they are fighting the Lycan and the werewolves but not before the human towns turn on Talbot town, the Lycan Xavier plans to destroy the humans in a huge epic battle which was harder than the human battle. Unfortunately it took a spell from Azile for everyone to except that Talbot was right and the humans were werewolves but not before Bailey shot him, why can't people just trust he is right, he has over 100 years of experience.Love the new man in Talbot's life Mathieu and his talent for beer.I wanted more of Oggie's story though, running with wolves and still fighting his way back to Talbot.All in all another great story and can't wait for the next part.Well done Tufo well done"}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14452764-tim", "userReview": "Tufo's best yetLycan Fallout is a fantastic continuation of the tales of Mr. Talbot. This is a great story with much action and humor. The pace is perfect and the writing is excellent as usual. As one beloved character was lost in the previous book, a new one was introduced. Mathieu is a great new addition and the interactions with Michael are very funny. There is a good abundance of violence in this book and the action propels the plot at a quick pace. Mark has always been a great writer but I believe this is his best work so far and I didn't want the book to end.

Just WOW!I always anticipate your ZF and LF books. Another amazing hit. I do love how you bring back our reminders to beloved previous characters and old Talbot memories. Michael is always jumping into stuff without a thought. But I don't think I'd have him any other way. Oggie! Now he is a social kickass companion and hit me worried a bit on the 2 Lycan situation, sweat I almost cried. Don't make me wait long for book 3! A must read series.

His books take you to future worlds and dimension that keep you either grossed out, feeling depressed or laughing till near puking. That's because those are just the tip of the emotional mountain range of Michael Talbot. In Fall of Man, Mike is pulled into his namesake of a town: Talboton. There, he comes across people who don't believe he is who he is, let alone can do what the books says he's done. Does it really matter though? Oh yes it most certainly does! The lycans are using humans in a way unimaginable, and it's an excellent tool- but this story is so much more than that. It's about humanity, and how even at the very end of things, there's still hope and a chance against all odds. This books also tells you, that even at the worst of times, family, friends and a good zap to the butt can make you smile. I think I enjoyed Lycan Fallout's Fall of Man because it gave me a healthy view of Mike's inner and outer being. Yes, he's part vamp, but there's so much more. And since we know there's a heaven or hell (in this series- don't fuss at me and my faith!), I'm thinking God is going to give him a spiritual break at some point. I don't know- I'll have to keep reading.

Once again an amazing and exciting story with no disappointments at all. My only criticism is that I would rather read the end of the story instead of having to buy two more books.

Talbot\u2019s memories and ties to his family are poignant and heartfelt leaving the reader near tears and sometimes smiling.Lycan 2 is not for the weak at heart as it is violent and gory. The mannerisms of Michael Talbot and his relationships snag the reader and create a bond that is strong. Talbot is addictive!Mark Tufo maintains the personality of Michael Talbot and his other characters sometimes bringing them out in new friends but the integrity of Michael Talbot remains clear and ever present.Sean Runnette is Michael Talbot.

When he started to kill them, he realized that there were over a hundred of people packed in tight behind that metal / steel bullet shield they were moving forward, and he went into a full on vampiric blood rage, and killed mostly everyone there. Had me gritting my teeth the entire time. What does piss me off is when people know that a person is a werewolf but because the infected person isn't in werewolf form, the populace finds pity on them and wants to help them, and it comes full circle when it bites them in the ass (no pun intended), when they change over to werewolves and start slaying the populace. You know what the sad thing about that is? I can actually see that happening in real life. Sad but true. Then at the end, Michael Talbot gets his dog Oggie (A. Purpose) back, basically escorted back to Michael Talbot by a very LARGE pack of wolves (Who hate werewolves and lycan just as much as humans). So sad that Tommy is dead, going to miss the pop tarts and the \"Mr. T and/or Mr. Dad\" remarks!

This is what happens each time a new Mark Tufo books lands on my kindle, i am so captured by it that i just can't put it away. What i like about Lycan Fallout at first was that Mark Tufo just pics Mike Talbots Story up, afther about 200 years. I know that this is not a zompoc book, but a few zombies are present, and the fact that he has the courage to pic up a story long afther the zompoc say much about the talent of this writher. If you are infected with the Zombie Fallout Virus you just cant pass out on Lycan Fallout 1 and 2 (and hopfully 3 soon !!!!)***Spoiller****200 years old and Mike is still the same guy that stepped in Henrys poo. He still does not have a plan, he acts first and thinks later, all the atributes that made him the lovable hero that he is ! The relationship btw Mike and Azile evolves, and oh, wonder Mike finds somebody that can make beer, so his world, that is far away from being ok is a litle bitt better.

As Mike battled with his inner demons at the loss of Tommy, his heart is twisted beyond words.

As Bailey and Mike set out to try and defeat the lycan, Oggie runs off shortly after. As Mike comes across two small children, one boy and one girl, Bailey refuses to have their deaths, until the boy changes to a werewolf and threatens their very survival. As Mike stays gone for nearly a month, he comes across Mathiu, a man with the burden of murdering his family when he first shifted almost fifteen years earlier. As they enjoy beer together, the Lycan are never too far behind. As war breaks out over weapons between the Talbotons and several other groups, Mike's true colors are shown as he wipes an entire army down to nothing, causing Bailey to see him in a brand new and dangerous life. As Oggie saves the Alpha female, Sayra, the wolf pack and him team up, finally saving Mike and the fifteen odd survivors of Talboton left as the time before midnight end. Mathieu proves to be the allie as he chooses Mike's side over the werewolf.
