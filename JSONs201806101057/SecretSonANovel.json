This book had a good mix of the personal and political, heavy on the personal, which I liked. I got a great feel for various parts of Morocco and what it feels like to be an immigrant. I admired how while parts of this story are about big issues, the significance of the psychological aspects of family, including what\u2019s happened in past generations, and of friends and community, and most of all the importantce of each person\u2019s psychological makeup was shown clearly.It was a little weird at first but I ended up appreciating the separate sections to show the different points of view of the various characters. It was a bit jarring, but it was effective.This book is all about betrayal, both with malice and with supposed love and protection in mind. It\u2019s also about the feeling of not belonging. It\u2019s about poverty and injustice and other ills that can lead to poor conclusions.I understand depression despair, rage, and I could empathize greatly with most of the main characters, the privileged and the poverty stricken. But, I was still not so sold on some of the events, not really. I was a bit stunned by the ending, even though I had a good idea of what was coming. I felt some relief that in the end the characters did seem realistic and true to how they\u2019d been crafted.My two main complaints about this book are what I consider a weak ending and the lack of humor. Yes, there are characters in good humor and even characters that experience amusement, but I was never amused. Perhaps it\u2019s because I knew the gist of the plot before I read the book, but I felt that the book kept to a very narrow range of tone. I was very engaged when I was reading, at least up until toward the very end, but the way the story ended left me unsatisfied; I was gratified by how some of the subplots played out, but ultimately I was disappointed; I think I would have been much more pleased by so many different endings, sad or happy or any mix of the two. This is wonderful storytelling but the story ended up letting me down."}, {"userName": "Erika", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1658297-erika", "userReview": "If I had to sum this book up in one quick phrase, it would be: hauntingly beautiful.Lalami's writing style is beautiful. Sophisticated but not too over the top. Easy to read, but not juvenile. The story itself I could not stop reading. Youssef's relationships with his mother, his friends, and his new-found father are at times heartbreaking. There is a lot of emotion in his story and Lalami knows how to write it well. Despite being heartbroken, I could not stop reading.Then there is the political and cultural story of Morocco which is interesting as well (but I must admit, to me, was not as important as the personal story when I began to read). As a former anthropology student, I believe Lalami did her country justice. She showed the diversity of the people. Everyone has their own story and there are no simple answers to why some people live in the slums while others live in mansions or to why some people stand up and protest while others decide to sit out. Despite having finished this book two days ago, Youssef's story is still with me. It's a rare thing for a book to haunt me, for the story to stay in the back of my mind for days. Lalami is a writer that knows how to tell a story and not only meet my expectations but exceed them.*A note on the rating: When I won this book from the giveaways section, I told myself I would rate it fairly. That I wouldn't just give it five stars because it was free from the publisher. As I read this story and finished it, I knew I HAD to give it five stars. I loved the writing style, I loved the story, I loved the emotion, and found the overall effect deep and rich. Most importantly, I can't wait to share the book with my family and friends."}, {"userName": "Beverly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/876421-beverly", "userReview": "My thoughts:\u2022\tI was not quite sure what to expect when I started reading Secret Son, but I was quickly drawn into the story and found myself captivated by the writing and the journey of the sensitive na\u00efve nineteen year old protagonist, Youssef.\u2022\tI wondered about the quote included before the start of the story \u2013 \u201cThe fact that I/am writing to you/ in English/already falsifies what I wanted to tell you.\u201d (from Cuban American port Gustavo Perez Firmat) but it made more sense when I learned that the author wrote this book for American audiences and yes, the book did appeal to my American sensibilities.\u2022\tThe story is sent in contemporary Morocco after Sept. 11th which helps set the tone of the story.\u2022\tWhile each of the characters battles/confronts issues of identity, loyalty, and justice \u2013 it is Youssef\u2019s that are the main focus in the book. It is the unraveling of secrets that reveal the cracks in perception that cause personal turmoil against the outside forces beguiling with their promises.\u2022\tYoussef lives in a slum in Casablanca with his single mother who pushed him that a university education is the way out of poverty. But Morocco has a very stratified class society and while the government speaks that all is possible if\u2026, the actions say otherwise. And when Youssef gets to live this life of luxury and the attainment of a better future looks attainable, the fall back to poverty and the disillusionment of who he is shatters him until another type of dream is presented to him.\u2022\t This book highlights the struggle of Islamic fundamentalists vs. the corrupt liberalism of the power structure but this fight is definitely geared towards capturing the minds of men because there is not sugarcoating that this is an oppressive society for women. \u2022\tAnd while there are probably many answers to the question \u2013 \u201cWhy does one become a terrorist?\u201d this storyline answers that question as it pertains to Youssef. I thought the author \u201ckept it real\u201d without over simplifying or going-over-the-top and illustrates how complicated and complex the issues of change, modernity vs. traditional, and power are."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1301372-bill", "userReview": "In this superb short novel, Laila Lalami deftly limns the rise and fall of Youssef El Mekki, unacknowledged bastard son of prominent businessman, disillusioned activist, and bon vivant Nabil El Amrani. Seemingly sprung from the trap of the Casablanca slums when he learns that his father, far from being dead, is in fact a Moroccan tycoon, Youssef is soon caught in a complex web of familial and political intrigue. A mark of this novel's quality is its ability to portray what for many Americans is the mildly exotic culture of Morocco while also convincingly revealing the ways in which both Americans and Moroccans are enmeshed in their own cultural contexts (a point illustrated in another fashion by Malcolm Gladwell's recent Outliers). While each character acts as though autonomously, behind the apparently simple interactions between the characters lies a complex web of human relationships, cultural relationships, and sometimes sinister motivations, which Lalami gradually unveils. Lalami's lean style, unsparing eye, and tight construction mean not a word is wasted in this elegant depiction of the book's all too human characters and its damning indictment of the cruel forces that manipulate them."}, {"userName": "Calzean", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26416859-calzean", "userReview": "A little disappointing.

Often when I read first-time novelists, I notice some difficulty with dialogue (my own biggest downfall when I\u2019m writing fiction), awkward clich\u00e9s, and pages of text that don\u2019t really keep the story moving. Lalami managed to escape all these snares and Secret Son is a joy from the beginning to the end.On her personal blog, Lalami says she was recently asked why the main character is a man, and her response is \u201cYoussef c\u2019est moi\u201d. One might ask just how a woman writes a book about a man, and if the book qualifies for a review from a feminist perspective. If you ask this, you need to read Secret Son. The story is set in Morocco and tells of Youssef El-Mekki\u2019s coming of age. Youssef is a young man who lives in the slums of Casablanca. He believes the story his mother has always told him: that his father died in an accident when he was very young. He lives as a fatherless child in a patriarchal society. The shocking discovery that his father is not only alive, but also rich, is a seeming fairy tale come true. His mother Rachida warns him that his heart will be broken, but Youssef moves away from her and into an apartment offered by his father. It is not so difficult to imagine the direction the story takes, and eventually Youssef is sent back to his mother after his father\u2019s wife finds out about his existence.There is commentary on the desperation of life in Casablanca for poor young men who feel drawn into the \u201cfamily\u201d of fundamentalist leanings or the escapism of drugs. The difficulties posed when living in multiple cultures and the self-discovery of an alternative way are explored when Youssef\u2019s half-sister Amal studies in the U.S. and falls in love with a non-Muslim Latino. The truth of Youssef\u2019s birth and his mother\u2019s precarious living situation reveals an all-too-common truth of a class-conscious society, where the higher classes abuse the women of the lower classes and then discard them.Although Youssef is the main character, the exploration of women\u2019s roles\u2014and the often stifling and hypocritical expectations put upon them\u2014is a theme throughout the novel. Amal\u2019s rebellion against her father and cultural norms\u2014by insisting on studying in the United States and living with a non-Muslim, non-Arab man without marriage\u2014is a perfect foil for Rachida\u2019s story of love and betrayal by Youssef\u2019s father Nabil, and the ultimate rebuilding of her life.One of the most interesting things for me as both a writer and reader is the way the story\u2019s narrative actually changes when different characters are speaking. For example, we see the initial meeting between Youssef and Nabil first through Youssef\u2019s narrative and later through Nabil\u2019s. When Nabil reminisces about the meeting there are inconsistencies between the two descriptions. In another area, a visit by Amal to Rachida also varies markedly between the two versions.Unlike some books, the narrative does not clearly delineate that this part is from one point of view, and this other part is told from another. Instead, the story unfolds organically and it is up to you to catch these interesting discrepancies. I asked Lalami if it was intentional, and she explained: \u201cThe technique of using inconsistent dialogues in different points of view is absolutely willful on my part, and in fact I had to stop my copy-editor from trying to make it consistent. You are absolutely right that this is something that reinforces the fundamental fact that we each hear different things in a conversation.\u201dLalami\u2019s first novel is a jewel that takes her previously published short stories out for a longer spin and produces a beautiful and moving expose of Morocco\u2019s duality\u2014a duality that exists for many who are straddling two differing cultures. Lalami has taken the threads of several stories and sewn them together into one whole that shows how our lives entwine and how our choices change each other in both tangible and imperceptible ways.Review by Aaminah Hern\u00e1ndez"}, {"userName": "Pamela Pickering", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/837540-pamela-pickering", "userReview": "4.5 Stars! After reading some of the other reviews I wish I could be as eloquent as they have been but alas, I am not a writer--just a simple reader. Nevertheless, I continue. I was surprised at how taken I was with this novel. Would I have picked it up off a bookseller's shelf? I'm not sure. However, I certainly appreciated Lalami's writing style and found her stark descriptions of modern Morocco, it's culture, and its struggles quite captivating. Gently, Lalami pulled me into Youseff's life and I found myself quite taken with this young man. I was also taken with his mother and the sacrifices she had made in order to avoid shaming her family. This is a hard book to put down and it is certainly an appropriate novel for this decade. I give it only 4.5 stars simply because I did not care for the ending but, to be fair, I'm not sure if an ending I desired would have been best for the author's message.Once again, I find myself in the difficult position of trying to find a new read once I have finished such an exceptional one."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2050107-jane", "userReview": "Secret Son tells the story of Youseff El Mekki.He has grown up in the slums of Casablanca with his mother, and now he is going to college, working and dreaming of a better life.He believes that his father died in an accident, before he was born, before he had a chance to marry his mother. But he discovers that story is not true, it was a fabrication by his mother to try to protect them both. His father is very much alive.Indeed he is a wealthy, if somewhat shady, businessman. A man who has a daughter, who is asserting her independence from her parents, and a man who has always wanted a son.His father welcomes his son, installs him in a luxury flat, and finds him a job. And Youseff falls in with his plan, neglects his studies, his friends his mother.The trouble is, his father tells no-one else about his new-found son. Well how could he? And, inevitably, when things go wrong Youssef has a long way to fall.His mother stands by him, supports him, but when he falls in with bad company that may not be enough to save.It\u2019s a simple story, but one built on classic lines. And it drew me in from the very first page and held me, swiftly turning the pages, until the very end.Laila Lalami writes lovely, clear and elegant prose, and her story is very well-balanced. Plenty to hold the interest without there ever being too much to keep track of, and everything that is there is needed to make the story complete.She evokes both the poor and the wealthy streets of Casablanca simply but very, very effectively.But most of all this is a story driven by its characters, and they worked very well. Youssef was a terribly believable young man. I admired his mother, and felt for her as her son uncovered her secret and moved away from her, not really understanding that she had done her best for him, had given him so much. I cared less for his father, but his behaviour was understandable, if not likeable.And if I have a small criticism, it was maybe that the characters, what they said, what they did, was often a little predictable. They almost invariably did exactly what I was expecting. And, of course, people often do just that, but just one or two gentle twists could have enriched the story.This is a book with a lot to say. About the effects of lies told and secrets kept to protect loved ones. About class divisions and the way they determine and restrict lives. And, most of all, about loss, loyalty, and love.It says it very well, with compassion but no sentimentality or preaching.Secret Son is accomplished, and very readable, first novel.It\u2019s a book that I am pleased to have discovered, thanks to its longlisting for this year\u2019s Orange Prize. I think its certainly worthy of that place, and that maybe it has the potential to cross over to a wider audience.I\u2019m not sure though that the extra star quality needed to make the shortlist is there -but it\u2019s a first novel, and I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised to see Laila Lalami\u2019s name there before too long."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/166684-mary", "userReview": "Youssef El-Mekki grew up in Casablanca, in the slums of Hay An Najat where houseflies \"grazed on piles of trash, competing with cows and sheep for tea grounds, vegetable peels, and empty containers of yogurt.\" One young man by circumstance, another by birthright, at nineteen Youssef learns shocking details about his real father that thrust him into a world of sudden luxuries, luxuries that at once elevate his circumstances and separate him from the places and people he loves.Amal Amrani, by contrast, grew up a daughter of privilege and means. When she moves to the States and defies her wealthy parents' wishes, she is cut off both emotionally and financially. Later, in a gesture of reconciliation and renewed support, her parents cross the ocean to witness her graduation. Amal holds the door open for them at the end of a visit, \"forgetting that Moroccans do not open doors for departing guests for fear of giving the impression that the guests are unwelcome.\" It is a striking symbol of how much her new life has changed her.Exhibiting two very different approaches to filial duty, Amal reluctantly returns to Casablanca to reestablish her position in the family, leaving her new love behind in the States; Youssef embraces his newfound father's world of wealth and status, leaving his mother behind in the slums. Repercussions from the secret that Amal and Youssef have both borne for years--each without knowing it--ultimately cause them to question the very foundations of duty, loyalty, and love. In the end, both must choose. Both must declare their allegiance. Unfortunately for Youssef, his choice (which is no choice at all) hastens his descent into a shadowy religious underworld where faith is a weapon and all believers must be tested.At its heart, Secret Son is a gorgeously rendered and heartbreaking tale of longing and belonging, of finding--and also leaving behind---the people and places we call home."}, {"userName": "Abby", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/638271-abby", "userReview": "Meh.

At university Youssef is aware of them all \u2013 the Mercedes-and-Marlboros crowd with their flawless French, the religious crowd, the political activists. He meets corrupt business people and liberal journalists. We see graduates who have no life chances despite their education, because they do not have the right connections. But this might also be its weakness. The novel perhaps ticks off a little too conscientiously all the different groups and issues that need to be covered. And the ending, which seeks to tie the strands together, felt unconvincing to me.The book is at its strongest when it lets the characters speak louder than the issues. The writing vividly evokes the sights, sounds and smells of Youssef\u2019s different worlds \u2013 the cool, perfumed lives of the rich and the oppressive intimacy of the poor.Youssef\u2019s relationship with his mother is driven by his confusion about women and sexuality.

Leaving his mother behind, Youssef assumes a life he could only dream of: a famous and influential father, his own penthouse apartment, and all the luxuries associated with his new status. His future appears assured until an abrupt reversal of fortune sends him back to the streets and his childhood friends, where a fringe Islamic group, known simply as the Party, has set up its headquarters. In the spirit of The Inheritance of Loss and The Reluctant Fundamentalist, Laila Lalami's powerful first novel explores the struggle for identity, the need for family, and the desperation that overtakes ordinary lives in a country divided by class, politics, and religion.", "title": "Secret Son: A Novel", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4654809-secret-son", "average": 3.41, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1274066581l/4654809.jpg", "reviews": 193, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/81319.Laila_Lalami", "name": "Laila Lalami"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Northern Africa"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4654809-secret-son", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20262502-the-moor-s-account", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1250814.Hope_Other_Dangerous_Pursuits", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34851317-the-other-americans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/669780.Season_of_Migration_to_the_North", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11039009-the-granta-book-of-the-african-short-story"]}
