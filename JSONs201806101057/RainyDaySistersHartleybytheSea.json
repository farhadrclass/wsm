I love books that go back to either the same character over time and or the same community and you get to follow up with characters. \"Rainy Day Sisters\" is the first book in the Hartley-by-the-Sea series by Kate Hewitt. \"Rainy Day Sisters\" follows two main characters, half sisters Juliet and Lucy. Juliet is older than Lucy by about 10 years I think. Juliet and Lucy are not close. Their famous artist mother, Fiona, moved to Boston more than two decades ago with Lucy and left Juliet behind to fend for herself. Lucy is going through a terrible time after a horrible review (written by her own mother) comes out in the press before her first gallery showing. Juliet offers her a place to stay in Hartley where she can lick her wounds and hide for a bit. Problem is that Juliet almost wishes Lucy gone as soon as she arrives. Both sisters definitely have a lot to learn about each other.I honestly loved both characters so much while reading this. Juliet is reluctant to let anyone in. When your mother tells you she never wanted you and does her best to not acknowledge your existence it's hard. And Juliet is resentful from all of the love she sees that Fiona gave Lucy when she was a child that she never got. Juliet is running a bed and breakfast and has her two shelter dogs and she thinks that may be enough. When Lucy comes to stay a lot of old wounds for her open up.Lucy is reeling from her mother's betrayal as well as the ultimatum she gave her boyfriend blowing up in her face. Getting a temporary job at the local school should help Lucy keep things together, however, she finds herself crushing on the head of the school who makes Mr. Darcy look downright pleasant. I loved the conversations that Juliet and Lucy eventually have. It takes a while for them to open up to each other though so don't expect things to just be fantastic a few chapters in. I think Hewitt did a good job showing how hard it would be to connect to someone you don't really know, but are expected to be close to due to blood ties. The secondary characters were great. We are introduced to Rachel Campbell (she's one of the characters in book #2) in this one along with the love interests that I really did enjoy. We get introduced to many people in this one that are followed up in books #2 and #3. I really enjoyed the writing and the flow of the book. Each chapter alternates between Juliet and Lucy. We also get some of the characters using Cumbrian words/dialect like areet for are you all right? I wish that we had more of that in this book with maybe a dictionary in the back, but for the most part you definitely got the gist of what people were saying. Hartley-by-the-Sea is a pretty cool setting. It's a lake district in Northern England. Most of the townspeople have known each other for years and you get to read about the prior history of some of the residents that gets followed up in subsequent books. I really loved this ending. Hewitt could have made it schmaltzy, but refrained. She was quite realistic that both sisters relationship was not going to magically get better. If you have a terrible mother through your childhood, chances are she's still going to be terrible when you're an adult as well."}, {"userName": "Laurel-Rain", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1402123-laurel-rain", "userReview": "Fiona Bagshaw had not a maternal bone in her body, and for most of their lives, her two daughters have lived apart: Juliet in England and Lucy in Boston. Fiona has become a rather famous artist and relishes that world.But after a humiliating experience because of her mother, Lucy has fled to Cumbria in the Lake District, and to the small village of Hartley-by-the-Sea. Home to Juliet, who owns a Bed and Breakfast.Juliet had invited her and even arranged for a short-term job for Lucy in the primary school.Juliet is somewhat abrasive, while Lucy is friendly, open, and wears her heart on her sleeve.Immersing myself in the world of Rainy Day Sisters was a cozy and delightful experience. I felt like I was a part of their world, and loved discovering why the sisters (half-sisters, as Juliet often pointed out) had been separated, and what would need to happen before they connected completely.I rooted for each of the sisters as they struggled to overcome the rejections their mother had handed out, and I hoped, for their sake, that Fiona would somehow make amends and help them heal. But could that even happen at this late date? And even if Fiona made overtures, would the sisters accept them? Would Juliet and Lucy find romance, despite their history?I loved this book and recommend it for all who enjoy family stories, especially families fraught with dysfunction. 4.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3076351-kathryn", "userReview": "Two sisters, almost total strangers, begin a journey towards connection and a sense of family. They do not gel immediately, yet perhaps underneath they are more alike than they initially experience. Rainy Day Sisters is set in the fictional town of Hartley-on-Sea in Cumbria, England. Ultimately this is a story of hope and connection and finding family as two sisters battle it out to find what they need.Rachel the older sister, has set up a B&B, she is a rather self-contained, organised, lonely person. When her sister Lucy arrives to stay with her she is remote and clinical and rather disapproving of Lucy. She is very prickly. It was easy to dislike her, yet as the story unfolds, the more I understood her, the more I felt compassion for her.Lucy has come from Boston to stay with her sister, she is an artist, but has been shamed by her mother, the esteemed artist Fiona Bagshaw, in the press and through social media. Lucy seeks refuge with Rachel and begins a job in the local school as a temp office worker. While she is not really skilled for the work she soon finds her way about and her compassion and understanding for the children soon see her involved in the local communtiy.At the core of the sisters' lives is the influence their mother Fiona Bagshaw has had on their lives. She has been cold and unloving towards Rachel, who has felt jealous and angry with Fiona for the way she wanted Lucy. Yet it was never a bed of roses for Lucy either. She experienced some serious bullying at school because of her mother's 'art', and in general did not have a normal family experience.I liked how the novel explored the mother/daughter relationship through Rachel and Lucy and also with a few of the families in the town. The importance of family, love and acceptance is highlighted, and how important the actions of a parent are. In so many ways this is echoed throughout the lives of the villagers.The way the story developed was very believable, the characters felt very real, the town and its inhabitants adding flavour and impact to the story. I liked the way the story ended, not over the top, but realistic and promising."}, {"userName": "Aimee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081099-aimee", "userReview": "There were quite a few things that I liked about this book. The first thing that I really enjoyed was the scenery that was described throughout the book. I love reading books set in England and this one takes place in a charming little town called Hartley-by-the-sea. Hewitt includes many wonderful details about the town that I enjoyed. The author also does a great job of making the weather a part of the story whether it be a beautiful day full of sunshine or most commonly in this book a cold, windy, rainy day.I also liked how the Hewitt spent so much time developing the relationship between the sisters instead of focusing on romances. I enjoyed reading about Lucy and Juliet really getting to learn to get along with each other. So many times books focus mainly on a romance, it was nice to find two sisters the focus of this book.The reason the book only got three stars for me is because it just wasn't a story that I felt compelled to read so I could find out how everything turned out for the different characters. I really didn't like any of the characters that much and I didn't have a great need to find out what happened to them. Juliet was so mean to Lucy so many times throughout the book that I found it hard to sympathize with her. I found Lucy more likable, but I found her romance in the story to be forced and it lacked chemistry. My favorite characters ended up being the smaller characters that were local townspeople that the sisters befriend.This is a well written book with a great location, but the fact that I didn't become emotionally involved with the main characters made this just an ok read for me."}, {"userName": "Fictionophile ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4428094-fictionophile", "userReview": "Like the lovely aga on the cover, \u201cRainy day sisters\u201d will leave you feeling warm and happy.Set in the west of Cumbria, this novel features two sisters who are virtual strangers. They have the same mother, but they grew up on different continents and were rarely in touch. When Lucy, the younger sister, has a life crisis, she turns to her half sister Juliet. Unsure of her welcome, she travels across the ocean to stay for four months with her elder sister who runs a bed and breakfast in the seaside village of \u201cHartley-by-the-Sea\u201d, population fifteen hundred. Her B&B hosts guests from far and wide, mostly people on walking holidays.Juliet is a very solitary person. Lonely, but seemingly unable to let her guard down long enough to make friends. The outgoing Lucy is very intimidated of her half-sister, who gives her a cold welcome without so much as a hug. They tiptoe around each other, both physically and emotionally.Juliet has arranged for Lucy to take a temporary position as a primary school receptionist/secretary. Lucy, who is an artist, has no skills to take to her new position and finds the job challenging. The head teacher, though very handsome, is taciturn and chilly in demeanor.The girls had very different upbringings. Their mother, Fiona Bagshaw, is a prominent artist and an outspoken social commentator. Lucy had lived under her mother\u2019s shadow in Boston, Mass. whilst Juliet, eleven years Lucy\u2019s senior, was on her own in England. Juliet was estranged from her mother, who treated her coldly and didn\u2019t so much as acknowledge her birthdays and Christmases over the years. She felt unloved and unwanted her entire life.As early autumn turns to winter, Lucy\u2019s warm effusiveness eventually breaks the ice around Juliet\u2019s heart and the sisters gradually warm toward each other, but not without some stumbling blocks along the way. This change in Juliet causes her to open up to other people, especially the sheep farmer up the road.\u201cHartley-by-the-Sea\u201d is in a part of England that I dream about. The friendly village and picture perfect views of the Western Lake District make for an idyllic setting for a novel. The charming Cumbrian customs and dialect add extra flavor to this excellent example of women\u2019s fiction. I can\u2019t wait to visit the village again in the next \u201cHartley-by-the-Sea\u201d novel, \u201cNow and then friends\u201c.The second novel in the series features different characters from the same charming village. We meet them only fleetingly in the first novel.Quality women\u2019s fiction, gorgeous setting, and a whiff of romance, make for escapist fiction at its finest.I received a digital copy of this novel from Berkley/NAL via NetGalley.

They are 11years apart and Lucy and their Mom moved to Boston when Lucy was only 6 and Juliet stayed in England. To say that they aren't close at the beginning of the novel is an understatement. Even though they don't really know each other, Juliet invites Lucy to her b&b in Hartley-by-the-Sea when her life in Boston falls apart. Juliet is very unfriendly and resentful of the life that Lucy lived with their mother and is very unfriendly to Lucy. So now we have two sisters who dislike and resent each other but they still need each other. They both need family and need to learn to be each other's family despite their earlier feelings. Their struggle to learn whether they can depend on each other is the major theme of the novel.The novel is very good. There were times that I didn't like either one of the sisters but once I understood their backgrounds, they became more likable.

It tales the tale of two sisters, bound together purely by the fact they have the same mother and is set over a four month time scale. The book is split into chapters giving the story from the prospective of the two girls in turn, although narrated from the third person.Although at times I found the story a little predictable, it's a romance after all, the book flowed and and the pages kept turning, in fact I devoured the story in one sitting all bar my tea breaks!!Lucy - is the younger of the two sisters and arrives at Juliets door from Boston after her life falls apart. Her, their, mother is a well known artist and has embarrassed Lucy in the most public and humiliating of ways. That thrown in with her losing her job and her relationship falling apart she escapes to the wet, cold and windy Cumbrian village.Lucy is incredibly naive at some of the things that happen and as a reader you could just see how the out come was going to be.She's also crazy, live and bubbly and surprises her self when she gets a new, albeit temporary job at the local primary school, and starts to form new friendships. Over the course of the four months that she is there she also forms a strong bond with Alex, the head teacher. Alex has his own problems, a widower with two young daughters... Bella, a preteen with attitude and facing bullies at school, and 6 year old Poppy who you just couldn't help but fall for with her cute ways. Lucy has a tendency to fall head first and it's no different with Alex but as she's only there for a few months they keep their distance.Juliet is the older sibling and is as tough as they come... On the outside. Lucy and their mother left her for Boston when she was at university and they've barely seen each other since, not that Juliet and her mother had a loving relationship to start with. Juliet resents Lucy and when she arrives at her door she regrets agreeing her to come and stay instantly. She hasn't got the time for Lucy and her sob story, after all, she feels if it wasn't for Lucy hen she and her mum may have a relationship.Juliet has her own troubles. She's lonely, clear as day lonely even though she lives in a small village where everyone knows everything about each other, but deep down she's hurt and heartbroken. She appears cold hearted due to rejection from her mother, not the only one to make her feel like that... She was also left to fend for herself when dealing with an ectopic pregnancy - I've been through this myself and know just how hard it is - and is now desperate for a child, someone she hopes will love her and need her.Juliet appears to have only two real friends in the village, her neighbour Peter who had a thing for her but she's in denial about, and her cleaner Rachel.Rainy Day Sisters brings Juliet and Lucy together but it's not a easy ride. Whilst Lucy just wants her sister to open up to her, Juliet can't help but find flaws in Lucy.Just as they are getting somewhere, heir mother calls up and Lucy jumps like a lap dog back to Boston, leaving a gap in the bridge her and Juliet had almost mended, after almost declaring her feelings to Alex and telling the girls she was staying as it was her new home....I loved reading this book, I've family in Cumbria and felt quite nostalgic reading about the weather, the sheep and village life as well as enjoying a good romantic story, well written with ups and downs.The characters were easy to get to know and I'm hoping that the next book in the Hartley-By-The-Sea series picks up where it's left off as I'd love to know how Juliet and Lucy move forward as sisters plus how they are moving on with Peter and Alex respectively."}, {"userName": "Kathleen E.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6047227-kathleen-e", "userReview": "Saturday, August 8, 2015Rainy Day Sisters: A Hartley-by-the-Sea Novel by Kate Hewitt, \u00a9 2015Rainy Day Sisters is set in the fictional village of Hartley-by-the-Sea.

Surrounded by farms and hillsides, Hartley-by-the-Sea, population fifteen hundred, is a quaint, quiet seaside village with passers-by enjoying the northern England countryside.A lot of rainy tea-drinking days interfold these two sisters as they become acquainted as adult women. One with everything orderly and the other with self-expression floating about. They balance each other in a certain way, bringing out the characters of others in their vicinity. Juliet has been here ten years and finds Lucy able to bring others out within her few months ~ mainly because she asks them questions. I am hoping these families will continue in the following stories, and this is just an introduction to them.I liked the openness in which the characters are eventually able to express themselves, after routine days, one after the other, mundane in themselves. Likely, because someone cared to ask and involve themselves in their lives. Especially with the gathering at the pub for the monthly quiz. That sounded like fun ~ sort of like a trivia contest.***Thank you to author Kate Hewitt for inviting me to read and review the first book in her new series, Hartley-by-the-Sea, and to the publisher, New American Library, a division of Penguin Group, for sending me a review copy.

And now that I have read it and fallen in love with the village of Hartley-by-the-Sea and some of the townspeople, I cannot wait for future books in this series by Ms. Hewitt.Rainy Day Sisters is a primarily character-driven novel. Lucy leaves Boston after a public embarrassment to go to England to stay with her half-sister and seemingly find herself. Lucy imagines herself on a quintessential British holiday, however she doesn't realize how far out of the way Hartley-by-the-Sea is or how two cultures can speak the same language yet not be understood. She also pictured bonding and healing with her half-sister Juliet. However as expected in a book, things don't go as planned. But sometimes things that aren't planned work out for the best.Juliet extends the invitation to her sister then wonders why she did it. She's not a total recluse, she runs a B&B but she doesn't have anyone really steady and involved in her life. She sees the townsfolk and talks to them and she and her neighbor Peter talk from time-to-time but she doesn't even realize that she doesn't have any close bonds. And she doesn't expect any to form with her half-sister who their mother took with them when she left England and left Juliet behind.There are bumps in the road with the relationship between Juliet and Lucy, but I was always pulling for them. I wasn't sure if I liked Lucy at first but she grew on me. I liked Juliet and could relate to her (well except for the being estranged from her mother). Both women want something more but they don't realize that they will find that something more together.It's a great, fun novel about finding yourself and learning to trust others and trust yourself and decisions you make. Of course the path isn't easy, but life isn't. There are funny moments, sad moments, and profound moments. The writing is great. I think Ms. Hewitt told this story very well, interspersing humor and wit with the serious aspects.If you enjoy women's fiction or just a great relationship read with some hints at a romance plot then this is the book for you. There is something for everyone in this one. Sisters, friendship, romance, failed relationships, family squabbles, small village life, it's all in there. And I loved the setting. I want to go to Hartley-By-The-Sea. No the weather is not always ideal but somehow it does sound like that quintessential British village in the countryside. I felt like I was there getting to know Lucy and Juliet and the townspeople.I loved this book, the characters, the writing, the storyline and I look forward to future books in this series.

No remuneration was exchanged and all opinions presented herein are my own except as noted.There are bad mothers and then there are selfish, terrible women who have children to serve some agenda other than motherhood. In this book we see two half-sisters. When Lucy undergoes a public humiliation and a break up her barely known to her sister invites her to stay with her in England. Mi casa is sort of your casa. The inn in question is in a small village and since Lucy is actually British, Juliet fixes her up with a job. At the job, Lucy makes friends.Where Juliet\u2019s experience of her mother was terrible it seems to have turned her into a hard, mirthless woman. Her Mother left her to go to the US with Lucy while she was in high school. Nevertheless she goes into the hospitality industry. This was a sticking point to me; Juliet is nearly anti-social. If she were the keeper of the inn where I was to stay, I would leave.On the other hand, Lucy has grown up with their showy, self-aggrandizing mother. But she is much sunnier, given to ignoring what she doesn\u2019t like, and fickle about her path.The two together form a shaky alliance, bound to collapse on some front. Juliet resents Lucy because of their mother. There\u2019s a big revelation that actually cements the two as sisters, and even friends. It takes time to get there.This story is well-written and a sensitive portrayal of two people recovering from the failure of the most primal of life\u2019s relationships: Mother and Child. Their shared mother gives them common ground but also sets them up for division. While Lucy\u2019s open nature and willingness to give her all brings Juliet forward, Juliet\u2019s steadfast nature gives her the support she never had maternally. It\u2019s interesting that both characters suffer the same parent and grow up damaged, but one from abandonment and neglect and the other from a different kind of neglect.I liked the description of the area including the use of local Yorkshire dialect.I like the way the relationships develop; the way Juliet\u2019s small town accepts Lucy even before Juliet fully does. Juliet\u2019s anger is finally allowed to come out and its release allows her to grow into a kinder and gentler person. The only thing that really bothered me is how skewed Juliet\u2019s personality is; she is barely socialized.The pace is slow, like the pace of life in a small town.Having difficult sibling relationships I felt I understood the story and that it \u201cspoke to me.\u201dIt was worth my time if a little slow."}, {"userName": "Suze Lavender", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29148122-suze-lavender", "userReview": "Lucy's mother has ruined Lucy's life and she has to get away from it all.

She still influences their lives and the way they behave. They need to become their own person and when they finally get to know each other they have a chance to achieve that. I liked that aspect of the book a lot. Juliet is inaccessible, but she's also craving love. Opening up is scary and she tries to hide behind a mask of unfriendliness. It broke my heart because she deserves so much more. Lucy is such a kind and gentle person. Instead of being welcomed with open arms after the traumatic events in Boston she gets unfriendliness. She's resilient and strong and she's such a wonderful, open person that she will be able to defrost anyone. I loved that about her. I like books about sisters and Rainy Day Sisters is a great one. It's such a touching story and I couldn't stop reading. I kept being really curious to find out what would happen next. Kate Hewitt switches between the sisters in her chapters. I think that works really well. Both Juliet and Lucy have a distinctive own voice and I was equally interested in either of them. The story is strong and there are many interesting moments.

They are brought together by a mutual dislike of their thoughtless and egotistical mother, after she publicly shames Lucy's art work. In an uncharacteristic moment of weakness Juliet offers Lucy a way of escape, and a part time job. As the story unfolds the sisters learn to understand each other and work through old resentments and jealousies. With the security they find in each other, they begin to open up to new possibilities in other areas of their lives along the way.

The characters are well rounded and likeable, and the book is descriptive and well written. This is a great easy read with a lot of ups and downs along the way.

Juliet just feels like she was never loved or wanted and feels very jealous of Lucy, where as Lucy also feels very let down by their mother, who was an embarrassment when she was at school.A lovely, sometimes moving story of sisters who overcome difficulties in their relationship to find themselves and to open up barriers and let other people into their lives as well and also to find forgiveness.I loved this book and would love to read other work by this author."}, {"userName": "AngryGreyCat", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13236257-angrygreycat", "userReview": "I was at Barnes and Noble today and picked this one up totally on impulse. Haven\u2019t heard of the author or read anything about the book. I read the first few pages and got drawn in and had to buy it. The story revolves around Juliet and Lucy, two estranged sisters, who are reunited after Lucy\u2019s life turns into a train wreck at the hands of their mother, Fiona.Lucy joins Juliet in Cumbria at her B&B and soon makes herself a member of the community. There are romances and romances to come hinted at in places. There is drama in form of the sisters\u2019 rocky relationship and Fiona\u2019s drama queen actions. I really enjoyed the story and the plot and how the chapters alternated between the sisters. I loved the Cumbria setting. It was well developed and gave me a true sense of place. Most of all I liked the ending resoluion between the girsl and their mother. It was so much more realistic and satisfying than the typical ending of life long issues found in women\u2019s fiction.

Winsome characters, romance-worthy setting, and enough relationship drama to keep me up at nights. I can\u2019t say enough good things about this one, including the fact that it\u2019s clean. From page one, I loved sweet Lucy and her hopeless optimism. I ached for prickly Juliet while rooting for Lucy\u2019s determination to crack her nut-hard shell. I relished the way these two estranged sisters found the complement in the other they each needed, leading them both to health and hope. And the romance they found along the way provided sweet icing on the cake.Though I savored this lovely story over the course of several sunny, summer days, Rainy Day Sisters would make an even more delightful treat swallowed whole this fall on your next curl-up-beside-the-fire-with-a-cuppa rainy day.Thanks to New American Library for providing me a free copy to review.

A novel about two sisters--well, half-sisters, who barely know each other--coming to grips with residual family grievances. When Lucy's life seems to disintegrate around here (mostly through her mother's callousness), she calls her older half-sister Julia in England. Julia, acting decided out-of-character, invites Lucy to come stay in Hartley-by-the-Sea, a small Lake District village. Juliet almost instantly regrets her decision, and when Lucy arrives hoping for a warm reunion, she finds Juliet cool, reserved. A little romance lies in wait for both sisters, but that does not dominate the novel.Although this differs from my usual reading, I have to admit that it was a pleasant respite from crime thrillers and mysteries. :)Read in August.NetGalley/Penguin GroupWomen's Fiction.

I had only read one book by Kate previous to this writing under the name Katharine Swartz. I didn't really like that book so was apprehensive about reading this new story. But within the first few chapters I realised this was a different kind of book altogether and overall I really enjoyed it. It's well written with excellent character development. It deals with lots of topical issues relevant to today's society but in a manner that is pleasant and not in your face. This was an easy, light read yet Kate managed to pack an awful lot in and the themes of sisterhood, friendship, forgiveness and healing were explored very well. With a fabulous yet at times windswept and wet setting, a great varied range of characters and several interesting story-lines Rainy Day Sisters makes for a great read.Each chapter alternates between half sisters Juliet and Lucy. The half here is important for the majority of the novel before barriers are even begun to be broken down. I liked hearing from each sisters viewpoint as it provided an alternative slant on events. There wasn't repetition in the sense that something happened and then in each chapter we read of each sisters take on it. More so some of the repetition was in terms of the weather, going out walking the dogs and Lucy's time at work. I understand based on the title of the novel that we would read about the weather but I just felt there was a bit too much of it. That said it is really the only minor complaint I had regarding this book.Twenty six year old Lucy Bagshaw is returning from Boston to make a new start in her life. Well she is giving herself four months to get everything back on track. She has suffered a deep hurt which is alluded to several times but the true nature of this upset is not revealed until much further into the novel. Her Life in Boston has fallen apart and she is seething with anger and resentment towards her mother but on the other hand is filled with worry and anguish at the thoughts of meeting her half sister Juliet. Reconnecting with someone you barely know and who made very rare fleeting appearances in your life is going to be very difficult. Immediately I thought fair play Lucy what a gutsy thing to do you have been torn to shreds and humiliated in Boston by someone who is meant to care for you but yet you are willing to move thousands of miles away from home to someone who is a virtual stranger to better your life. I have to admit Lucy was my favourite character Kate Hewitt wrote her so well and you can see such progression in her throughout the book. Lucy soon gets a job covering a maternity leave as receptionist in the local primary school. Headteacher Alex Kincaid is not the nerdy type she envisaged but drop dead gorgeous but he too comes with his own burdens and problems. Lucy slowly is only too willing to help him out and assimilate herself into community life in Hartley by the Sea.Juliet is the complete opposite to Lucy, I hate saying this but she comes across as so cold and unwelcoming. I think the author wanted us to dislike her at first in the way that she wrote this character and I certainly did. Juliet runs a guest-house in Hartley by the Sea perfect for all those hikers who come to enjoy the Lake District. She has lived in the village for ten years but still is like a newcomer. She doesn't have friends and doesn't really do friendship or sisters for that matter. Juliet prefers to spend her time cleaning the guest-house or out walking her two dogs. The reader really wants to know what made Juliet this way? Why was she estranged from her mother Fiona yet Lucy continued to live with her? Why is she always so closed and unwilling to let people in? Juliet created an awful lot of tension between the sisters there was no willingness to listen to what Lucy had to say or just to relax and smile and develop a sisterly bond. Instead poor Lucy on arrival was terrified to even leave the kitchen in anyway disturbed. I suppose I was meant to feel compassion for Juliet and I did when we discover the reasons for her outward behaviour as she had such a sad story to tell. But it just made me value the importance of sisters, friendship and the ability to confide in someone when times get tough. Juliet had gotten to the stage she was so desperately lonely that she was in danger of not being able to bring herself back from the brink. When local farmer Peter starts to make an appearance Juliet begins to thaw although I was disgusted at what she asked him to do. It was cheeky and uncalled for and on reflection she knew this herself.Obviously Lucy's arrival is the catalyst for change to occur in the sisters lives but it also helps some other residents of the village. The two women begin to realise they are 'not just strangers linked by the genes of a woman neither of them actually liked'. Forgiveness and reconciliation are two huge things Lucy and Juliet need to come to terms with. Let go of the past to embrace the future and only then will you be truly happy. Their childhood clearly had a deep impact on how they are now in the present. It affects their relationships and interactions with others and how they view men. They don't want to make the mistakes their mother did but are fearful as to how to not have history repeat itself. Also I loved all the various sub plots which I won't reveal here. They all fitted in really well with the overall plot and themes and not one felt out of place. In fact these characters and their stories only gave me tantalising glimpses of where Kate Hewitt could take us next. As Hartley by the Sea began to work its magic on Lucy and she becomes happy, relaxed and confident I found myself becoming really invested in the outcome for the sisters. But still their mother Fiona was such a strong overshadowing force in the book. I felt we knew so much about her through Lucy and Juliet yet we barely hear from her. Kate Hewitt managed to achieve this so well and deserves great credit as all these feelings and emotions stirred up in the girls by Fiona only made for a more realistically, interesting, thought provoking read.OK so we got the conventional ending in one sense but regarding the other issue fair play Kate Hewitt I was glad you did something different that showed life is not always sweetness and light and that forgiveness for something in the past can be very difficult. The author could have tied everything up very neatly at the end and with only 5 or 6 pages left to go I was wondering how she was going to do this so quickly. But no I was really happy with the outcome and believe it has set us up nicely for future books. There are definitely more stories to be told and explored in the lives of the residents of Hartley by the Sea. There were numerous supplementary characters in Rainy Day Sisters that were itching to make more of an appearance and share their good times and bad. I am already looking forward to who we will read about next. Place the Rainy Day Sisters on your reading lists it is a great book I really enjoyed and with such a beautiful apt cover how could you pass it by in the shops?"}, {"userName": "Agi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5074368-agi", "userReview": "\"Rainy Day Sisters\" is the first in the Hartley by the Sea series, and also my first book by Kate Hewitt. I really didn't know what to expect when I requested this book, I just had a feeling it may be a good read, and as it turned out, I was absolutely right - I have truly adored this story. It had me hooked from start to the end and I immensely enjoyed it. It was not a life - changing book, the plot might have not been the most original one, and yet on the whole it was incredibly refreshing story with some really great characters.The story is told from Lucy and Juliet's points of view, and the chapters alternates between those two. They couldn't be more different, those two half - sisters. Where Lucy is open, Juliet seems so very closed in her shell, where Lucy is willing to forgive, Juliet is tough, where Lucy is funny and warm, Juliet seems to be stern and cold, where Lucy is surrounded by friends and doesn't have any problems with making contacts, Juliet, who's been living in the village for ten years, doesn't really have any friends and prefers to spend her time walking her two rescue dogs - alone. Really, they are polar opposites. And yet, I truly liked both sisters, even Juliet, because we quickly learn what happened in both their lives, and then gradually learn about Juliet's sad life. I absolutely loved how the author made Juliet to come out of her comfort zone, even though till almost the end it was not sure that she's going to change. I also liked how we hear each sister's view on the same situation. So it's in fact no wonder that at the beginning the sisters are to a very rocky start, and I liked how the author described this all - well, you can't so quickly forget all your problems, grudges and regrets, and I adored how Lucy never gave up on Juliet, and how Juliet started to warm to her half - sister. Also, the more the two start to co - exist, rather then live under one roof, the more secrets are being unveiled, more inaccuracies are cleared, but also more problems are to come - of course! The author has truly made a brilliant job in the aspect of characters' development. As much as Lucy seemed to be the more open one, she also had her demons. She's just come to Hartley by the Sea in Lake District from Boston to make a fresh start, and it takes some time for us to learn what happened there. I didn't envy Lucy - in Boston there was a mother who betrayed her trust, and in the UK there was her half - sister, much older, whom she in fact didn't know at all, they didn't have anything in common - the reunion is going to be difficult and hard, no? But this was Lucy for you, grabbing the bull by the horns. And it looks like Lucy's coming to Lake District was the thing that both of them needed to let the past go, but is this possible at all?The mother of the two women seems to be a causer of most of the problems, and she's the one who has hurt her daughters so much. Neither Juliet, nor Lucy, make a secret that Fiona was not the model mother, and the more we get to know the relationship they had with Fiona, the more we see that they, in fact, have a perfect reason to despise their mother.This is not only a story about overcoming past, but it is also full of different twists and turns and various sub plots, and yet everything is clear and orderly here, and I never felt confused. There is also not a single flat second in this story, and the author concentrates not only on a broken family relationship, but also she gives us some romance here as well, and I loved those sub plots as well. Those were not the most important threads to the whole book, as it's mostly about sisterhood, but nevertheless Kate Hewitt has managed to made them also significant, and truly entertaining and different to each other! Adding this romance aspect, and especially the two men involved, was a real breath of fresh air. They both were as different as Lucy and Juliet themselves, but they were both brilliant, and both were also carrying their sorrows: one of them was widowed with two young daughters, the other one was the lonely caregiver of his father with the dementia. Those sub plots were not overwhelming, but very significant to the story, and I truly enjoyed how they were written. The villagers, and also the school - life were a real joy to read as well, Especially the scenes at school, there were so many of them, and mostly they were funny, especially when they involved Lucy starting working there, but also the author has very gently emphasized different problems of the students and their parents.I am not so sure if I'd myself like to live in those parts of Cumbria that the author has described, yet there was something nostalgic and beautiful in this place, even if it was almost all the time cold and so rainy. The scenery was so beautifully described, and all the sheep on the moors were adorable. Even in the rain!The author explores the mother/daughter and sisters relationship in this book, but not only - she also concentrates on different dynamics of the families in this little town, and they truly add a lot to this story. She also hints that forgiveness is not always easy, and that there are issues and things that we can't forget and forgive, even if those things happened among the family members - that blood is not always thicker than water. And she wrote it brilliantly, all the feelings were coming so true and honest, the tension and misunderstanding between the half - sisters were genuine and palpable through the pages, and this story has just felt so true to life. Kate Hewitt has managed to fill the pages to the brim brilliantly describing the relationship between two sisters that, in fact, didn't know each other, with different family dynamics, friendship, forgiveness, new beginnings and second chances, and this all was really wonderfully explored, with a lot of depth. \"Rainy Day Sisters\" is a brilliant start to the series and I can't wait to read the next instalments. It truly awoke my curiosity, and I'd love to see what's going to happen next, and who's going to be in the centre of attention in the next book. This story has just drawn me in and I didn't want to leave the village and the characters. Lovely enjoyable read, full of secrets, feelings and emotions - highly recommended.Copy received in exchange for a review."}, {"userName": "Janka H.
