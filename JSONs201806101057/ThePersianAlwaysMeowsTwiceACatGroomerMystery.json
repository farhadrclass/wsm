Opening her own shop, Cassie\u2019s Comfy Cats, a cat grooming and boarding specialty boutique she's starting to make a name for herself around the town and gather a list of clients. However when Cassie makes a house call to a rich but reclusive client she finds herself walking into a murder scene and added to the suspect list after having discovered the body. To help the local police and to clear her own name in the crime Cassie begins her own investigation into just what had happened to her client. Meanwhile Cassie can't help but worry about Harpo, the newly orphaned Persian that Cassie had been grooming for her now deceased client so she pushes to take care of him until the estate is settled. While in Cassie's care Harpo becomes a hot ticket as some of those involved believe he may come with an inheritance but before long Cassie finds herself in danger having Harpo in her care. The Persian Always Meows Twice by Eileen Watkins is the first book in the new cozy mystery series A Cat Groomer Mystery. This first installment was a solid read with all the fun cozy elements that readers would expect from this genre. We had a strong female lead with a somewhat quirky environment that questions everything and everyone when she's faced with a murder. There's a good selection of potential suspects as the book goes on leaving the reader guessing as to who the murderer may be. With this one being centered around a cat groomer I'd definitely say the book is for cat lovers as the author does get very detailed and specific to that profession to the point that I almost wondered if it was a bit too much kitty info in the beginning. But once the story start going it was easy to like the characters and get into the flow of the mystery. I'd also note that while most books of this nature have the police constantly saying stay out of the investigation it was kind of nice to have a detective admit that someone like Cassie may get people to open up and talk more than the police would. Overall, a nice start to this series and I'd certainly continue on to see just what happens next.

She makes house calls for her top client, millionaire George DeLeuw, to groom his beautiful Persian, Harpo. When she arrives for her scheduled appointment she finds Harpo next to George\u2019s dead body. The police are asking a lot of questions, even casting Cassie as a suspect. They are really getting nowhere until Cassie boards the furry feline at Comfy Cats and then several people become very interested in Harpo\u2019s well being and go to great and dangerous lengths to get their hands on the pretty Persian.I fell for the characters in this story immediately. Cassie, her friend Dawn, and her new employee Sarah are so well developed for the first book in this series. We also meet local veterinarian Mark who Cassie and I would both like to get to know better. The author also gives us a nice variety of suspects from the ex-wife, to the housekeeper, and more. Of course, they are some furry characters too, that I absolutely loved!The plot has some really nice twists. I thought I had figured out a very important clue and was pretty proud of myself until I found out I was totally wrong. The author manages to drop a key clue here and there as she tells us about cat grooming and Cassie\u2019s life. There are also a couple of very suspenseful moments that had me sitting up straight in my chair and really paying attention. At first I didn\u2019t think the story was fast paced until I reached the end and realized I had read the whole thing in one sitting. To say I escaped into the book is a true understatement.I love the theme of the series as I am a cat lover, the characters are some I want to get to know better, and if future mysteries are this entertaining, Eileen Watkins will have a hit series on her hands. The Bengal Identity will be released March 27, 2018 and it is already on my wish list. A cat-ivating cozy for all cozy lovers but for true cat lovers this is a must read!"}, {"userName": "Juli", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli", "userReview": "Cassie McGlone is a cat groomer, and runs her own business, Cassie's Comfy Cats. She deals with finicky felines all day and loves her job. Her job gets a lot more serious when she makes a house call to groom a client's pampered persian, only to discover the dead body of George DeLeuw. Reeling from the shock of finding her best client murdered, Cassie receives permission to board his cat, Harpo, until the will is probated. That's where the real trouble begins. Suddenly, everyone seems to want the cat for reasons that have nothing to do with the fact that Harpo is a gorgeous persian. Who killed George DeLeuw? And where does his orphaned kitty figure into it? Cassie knows for both George and Harpo's sake she needs to discover the killer's identity.This is a great start to a new cozy series -- The Cat Groomer Mystery series! I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. The mystery is very well written with some real surprises. Cassie is an intelligent and fun main character. The background theme of cats and cat grooming added to the plot, and made the book more interesting. I do not envy people who choose a career that involves bathing cats on a daily basis -- so Cassie is not only smart, but BRAVE. :) There were a couple side plots that helped with character development, but not in such a way as to overwhelm the mystery elements of the story. I did have to laugh at one point though...Cassie is thoroughly against cats being allowed to sleep in her bedroom at night. BUT....she is ok with them being on the table when she eats. I think I would much rather have a warm kitty cuddled with me at night than have them on the table near my food while I'm eating. :) All in all, a great cozy mystery that I very much enjoyed. The cover is awesome. Who can resist a sweet persian punim! :) A second book in the Cat Groomer Mystery series, The Bengal Identity, will be released in March 2018! :) **I voluntarily read an advanced readers copy from Kensington via NetGalley.

But scratch below the surface, and unmasking a killer becomes a game of cat and mouse . . .Professional cat grooming isn't all fluff--when the fur starts flying, Cassie McGlone, owner of Cassie's Comfy Cats, handles her feistiest four-legged clients with a caring touch and nerves of steel. While these qualities certainly help keep her business purring, they also come in handy when she makes a house call to her best client, millionaire George DeLeuw, and discovers his murdered body next to his newly orphaned Persian, Harpo.To help the local police find the actual killer, Cassie begins her own investigation. But no one, from George's housekeeper to his vindictive ex-wife, is giving up clues. Not until Cassie is given permission to temporarily board Harpo does anyone show interest in the Persian's wellbeing. Someone is desperate to get their paws on Harpo before the feline helps untangle a felony. Are there deadly truths that a cat whisperer like Cassie can coax out? She needs to tread lightly and remember she gets one life, not nine. . . .\"A delightful debut mystery. It's smart, well-plotted, and features a cast of characters--both human and feline--that I want to see more of. This book will be catnip for cat lovers.\" --Laurien Berenson, author of Wagging through the Snow\"The purr-fect mystery to curl up with for a lovely cozy read, preferably with a cup of tea, cuddly cat optional but recommended.\" --Leslie Meier, author of Turkey Trot Murder(Goodreads)Review:Cassie is a hard worker who wants to make her cat grooming/boarding house a success. So far things are working out well for her, but when one of her best customers is found dead, she is worried the death will change that. Not only will she not have his business to count on, since she is the one that found the body, she is afraid that will negatively affect her. Being somewhat nosy by nature, she decides to help in the investigation any way she can. The characters are well rounded and well developed. I liked Cassie, I thought she was a no-nonsense type of woman. The secondary characters, including her friend Dawn and her employee Sarah, were also well developed and people I would like to get to know better. There is also a possible love interest for her, the local vet, Mark. And all of the cats had their own personalities and added so much to the story.The writing style flows smoothly and the book is an easy read. I thought the mystery was well thought out and had enough suspects and twists and turns to keep the reader guessing. I liked the fact that Cassie did not put herself in danger while investigating the murder like so many protagonists do. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well crafted cozy. If you love cats, all the better. I am looking forward to reading the next one when it is published. I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for a honest review.

This crazy cat lady very much enjoyed this cozy mystery, the setting for which is Cassie's Comfy Cats in Chadwick, NJ. Cassie has recently purchased this beautiful 100+ year old home to use as a cat boarding and grooming facility after becoming a certified animal behaviorist and groomer. I was happy to meet a lovable Persian, Cassie's companion cats and those she boards, and was introduced to a mystery that keep me engaged and looking for the bad guy/ gal.Cassie left behind a stalking ex-boyfriend in Morristown, opening her business in a small town she was familiar with when visiting best friend, Dawn, who has a health food store in Chadwick. She is slowly building her business, beginning with the one cat she grooms in his home. Harpo is an adorable Persian whose very wealthy owner, George DeLeux, has his own in-home grooming room. When arriving for the regular appointment, Harpo was outside the McMansion and the front door was open, both highly unusual events. Once inside, Harpo led her to his master and friend, who was lying face down with a head injury, dead. Cassie couldn't imagine the man having any enemies, but he must have had at least one. The only suspect so far is Dion Janos, son of Cassie's handyman. As she asks a few questions around town and at the visitation, Cassie makes someone very nervous, sufficiently so that unusual incidents occur. Detective Angela Bonelli, assigned to the case, is willing to hear what Cassie finds as she knows Cassie might hear things the cops would not. George's attorney agreed to allow Cassie to board Harpo until the will is read, but suddenly Harpo becomes valuable to his only two family members. And Cassie becomes a target.I like Cassie and her dedication to caring for her own cats as well as those who are boarded with her. We learn the most about her, bringing a 3-dimensional woman to the forefront. She hires Sarah, a former high school math teacher as her assistant. While much of her personal past is deflected, there is no doubt she is a willing learner and hard worker. And she becomes a valuable employee and friend. Others that I look forward to getting to know better are Angela Bonelli and local veterinarian Mark Coccia.The author is adept at putting together scenes in such a way as to increase suspense or keeping the momentum going. This reader was drawn in from the first page and I was sorry to turn the last page. Plot twists introduce new suspects while eliminating others, and crimes behind the murder require the work of the FBI. The ending is nothing short of exciting and very satisfying. I highly recommend this cozy mystery to crazy (or not so crazy) cat lovers everywhere!"}, {"userName": "Ellen Whyte", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13470705-ellen-whyte", "userReview": "Cats and murder - couldn\u2019t be better, right? I\u2019ve been in the mood for cozy mysteries recently because I enjoy the short and sweet action.

Her shop was not just a place to have your cat groomed but also a boarding facility and offered things for an owner to spoil their cat(s).

However, when Harpo led Cassie into the study where she found Mr. DeLeuw facedown with a gash across the back of his head. This was just the beginning of the story. I found the characters to be believable and the description of Chadwick so inviting I would love to live there.

It was a well-written cozy read with several twists and turns to keep the reader guessing and a couple of different plot outcomes that were not expected.Cassie McGlone has moved to Chadwick, New Jersey to distance herself from her abusive ex-boyfriend named Andy. She has moved onto a street of converted Victorian houses and opened a shop called Cassie's Comfy Cats where she grooms and boards cats. She also has a degree in psychology which sometimes helps her in dealing with the cat owners. She lives upstairs with her own three cats: Mango, an orange tabby; Cat King Cole, a black cat; and Matisse, a calico.As the story opens, Cassie is interviewing Sarah Wilcox for an assistant position at the shop. She suddenly remembers she has an appointment at George DeLeuw's palatial home to groom his Persian cat named Harpo. George has a professional quality grooming studio in his home, and Cassie makes bi-weekly visits which helps make her mortgage payments. Upon arriving at his home, she finds Harpo outside under some shrubs with the front door open. She finds George dead sprawled face-down on the Oriental carpet with the back of his head bashed in. Cassie worries that Harpo will end up in an animal shelter, so she volunteers to board him until the will is read to see what provision has been made for the cat. The lawyers agree to this suggestion.Relatives start showing up at the shop demanding she hand over the cat to them. But Cassie is firm in keeping him until the will is read. Then a storage closet near a window catches on fire, someone tries to break into where she lives; and eventually, Cassie confronts the killer who has broken in to her shop trying to steal Harpo. Harpo is not that valuable, so what is going on? Some memorable characters include: Dawn, Cassie's best friend who owns a health food store down the street and gets a new kitten of her own; Detective Angela Bonelli of the Chadwick Police Department who, in-the-end, doesn't mind Cassie's help in questioning suspects; Nick Janos, Cassie's handyman; his son Dion who is a games tester and a freelance programmer and has invented a new process for performing more rapid public key encryption and decryption and needed George's help in marketing it; Charles Schroeder is managing director at the Securities Management firm dealing in mutual funds where George used to work; Jerry Ross is George's executive assistant; Marjorie is George's ex-wife who has a cause of her own; Danielle is George's sister who is trying to protect George's reputation; Anita is George's housekeeper; and Hector is George's landscaper. All but the 1st two become suspects.A couple of subplots include:- Cassie thinks her ex-boyfriend is stalking her after her mother lets him know where Cassie has moved to.- Mark Coccia and Cassie discover a mutual attraction with each other. Mark runs the Chadwick Veterinary Clinic.Cassie doesn't want to get involved in investigating George's murder, but she begins to question people at George's viewing because of her concern over Harpo's well-being. Things escalate and Detective Bonelli listens to what she has found out. Bonelli realizes that Cassie's intentions are good and that Cassie is in a position to hear and see things that she can't.

As soon as Harpo is in Cassie's care, everybody seems to want to get their paws on the kitty and life becomes dangerous for Cassie. So, of course, she sets about conducting her own investigation.

Honestly, when I saw this book on the giveaway list I laughed. I laughed out loud and startled my boyfriend. He wanted to know what I laughed about, so I read him the summary. He convinced me to enter, and though I doubted I would win, I was secretly hoping I would. It was such an odd summary. I never go for books like these, because I'm always afraid of them being... well, lame. However, that was not the case.Though the summary sounds kind of silly, the story was actually very well thought out. It had mystery and humor, and it just worked. It actually reminded me a lot of the \u201cMurder, She Wrote\u201d books.

The setting of the story was enchanting, the characters endearing, and the mystery was totally satisfying. I loved the main character, Cassie, and that she is not that similar to other main characters in other cozys. I think the main character and the setting, an expert grooming and boarding facility just for felines, sets this story apart from most. I love the twists and turns this book took. It had great characters, a strong story, and a great mystery. Sometimes with a first in a series, you can get lost in the author setting the tone for the whole series. This is not the case with this book at all.
