If not, it should have been. Almost a perfect choice for Oprah, although perhaps not quite grim enough.Until about 2/3rds of the way through I thought - I don't dislike this book but I don't quite like it either. I began to like it better as I read to the end but probably not enough to read another book by this author.It's the story of a just barely middle-class English family who love their farm and their way of doing things more than anything else, more than they love one another. Certainly more than they love \"strangers\" who have married into their family. Not that their farm is prosperous or that the land gives much back to them, but it's what they know and, for them, it's life. They are proud and unyielding and unwilling/unable to change and are emotionally shut-down. Carry on!Then, as must happen in order to have a story, change comes unbidden: two deaths and a 20-something, totally open, totally-in-the-moment young girl comes into their lives. Is this a story of redemption? Not quite, I don't think, but the younger generation may learn to shake the shackles of the past and help the older generation a bit."}, {"userName": "Juliet", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15987235-juliet", "userReview": "Possibly my favorite Joanna Trollope novel. This one is darker than her usual fare, but I loved it. The common problem that everyone is faced with -- how do we cope with the rigors of farm life -- is a very real and very challenging one. Zoe's character is quintessential Trollope, which is to say she is the newcomer on the scene who upends everything yet at the same time propels people toward the best choices. She's a bit too often right or good or something for my taste, but otherwise I loved all the characters in this book. I thought they were true individuals and distinctly drawn. One of my favorite scenes is between the surviving wife and their little boy, and her realization that she has to make decisions for his benefit, and the bond that is forged between them is wonderful. Trollope is always good at writing children, and this time is no different. I will definitely be re-reading this in the future."}, {"userName": "Bettie\u262f", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie", "userReview": "The funeral is held of wife and mother Caro Meredith.

Interesting characters, concise writing that is nonetheless completely descriptive of the physical (people and environment) and the emotional. \"Next of Kin\" explores the aftermath of death and its effect on the survivors. The story opens with the funeral of Caro Meredith, California-born wife of English dairy farmer Robin Meredith, dead of a brain tumor in her forties. Robin's grief is complicated by his dead wife's long detachment from the farm and from himself. Caro, a rootless wanderer who always wanted to belong somewhere, to someone, could never embrace the land-bound farm life and left her husband's bed years earlier.
