But not just any blue whale. This whale lived longer than any blue whale has ever lived. This great beast was swimming the oceans when Teddy Roosevelt was president. It lived through wars and depressions and the explosive growth of technology, and somehow managed to evade whalers and orcas to become the largest animal ever to have been on this great blue ball we call home. And it died. Not of some tragedy or violence, but of old age; it was time. And this whale washed up on a remote beach somewhere on the continent of Australia. So remote that no news copters flew overhead. No crowd of people gathered to gawk and cry and mourn. Even the predators that roam those waters and shallows\u2014the terrifying great whites and the ancient armored crocodiles\u2014did not come to partake in this bounteous feast. Perhaps out of deference, sensing that this creature was no ordinary denizen of the deep, but something much, much more. But its stature and status could not stop the work of those forces that work on all of us when our time on Earth is done. And as the blistering heat of Australia\u2019s summer sun shone down, and the internal gases pushed out, this blue whale expanded, like a magnificent and horrible fleshy hot air balloon, until the skin could scarcely contain it. That whale was still not as bloated as this book."}, {"userName": "Nette", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/768999-nette", "userReview": "I see from the other reviews that people either love or hate this book. I bought the stupid thing based on one rave review, and I hated it. Let me explain why by pretending that I'm the author and I want to get across the simple idea, \"She hated it.\" Deep from within her soul, somewhere where the light never touched, just as the light never touched the dark roiling depths of the ocean near Normandy, where so many men were lost, lost forever in the dirt and sand, sand like the irritation beneath her eyelids when she first awoke, restless from a dream in which she wasted $18 on a book based on an A grade in \"People,\" her stomach churning like the water in Battery Park during a storm surge, she hated this book."}, {"userName": "Keith", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/659583-keith", "userReview": "It is no secret to my friends that Mark Helprin is among my favorite authors. I realize my admiration for his work makes me suspect, less than objective. Neverthless I must share my initial reflections regarding his new novel. How can I put this? When I finished In Sunlight and in Shadow I was overwhelmed with the sheer power of the novel. I had the story in my head for several days, I actually couldn't get it out of my head. I have not been moved by any novel in such a manner for many, many years. I was reminded of Benjamin De Mott's extraordinary review of Helprin's Winter's Tale in the New York Times Book Review back in 1982: \"I find myself nervous, to a degree I don\u2019t recall in my past as a reviewer, about failing the work, inadequately displaying its brilliance.\u201d My less articulate comment to two of my colleagues at work was \"I may never read another novel.\" Clearly an overstatement, although it has been a week and I haven't started a new novel, a small record for me. In my estimation A Soldier of the Great War is Helprin's masterpiece with Winter's Tale a close second. Now, in the first flush, I am considering the new book to be the equal of those two. I plan to test that judgement with re-reads of both Soldier and the new one sometime soon. Helprin takes the reader back to NewYork City in 1947 in the first flush of the great post-World War Two Boom. The protagonists are Harry Copeland, a returned veteran, Jewish, and now the owner of his late father's leather goods factory and Catherine Everett Hale, aspiring actress and singer and the daughter of immense Wall Street wealth. Their romance and the kindling of their love forms part of the story but as in any other novel by Helprin there are many more back stories all of which are strands in the magical web of the book. As remarkable as the people is Helprin's loving and detailed evocation of the New York City. Here he becomes the undisputed bard of the city. I know of no one who so lovingly details all the streets and parks, buildings and rivers than Helprin. He clearly loves this city and that great affection shines through on every page. For a taste of this novel go to the author's web site and read the excerpt from the Prologue that's available there. http://markhelprin.com/novels/sunligh...No? It begins like this:If you were a spirit, and could fly and alight as you wished, and time did not bind you, and patience and love were all you knew, then you might rise to enter an open window high above the park, in the New York of almost a lifetime ago, early in November of 1947."}, {"userName": "Julie Christine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine", "userReview": "I spent five weeks with In Sunlight and In Shadow. Five monogamous weeks, which is quite a committed literary relationship for this fast-in, fast-out reader. Yes, life circumstances wore me out and distracted me, so that some days the amount of pages read would be imperceptible as measured on a standard ruler, but never once did I contemplate setting Helprin aside for a less complicated time or supplementing my evening reading with a less demanding literary companion. I was enthralled by this lush, resplendent novel. Each and every one of its 705 pages. The story itself is quite simple. In fact, the old-fashioned romance and adventure style makes this a curl-up-on-the-sofa read. But the beauty of Helprin\u2019s prose, its rococo grandeur and meandering lyricism, make it worthy of lingering. Take your time to reread certain passages and be astonished anew by Helprin\u2019s particular magic. Harry Copeland is in his early 30s and recently returned to Manhattan from the European Theatre of WWII. Harry is alone in the world, an only child, his parents deceased, and he is taking his time to heal from the emotional wounds and physical trauma sustained as a special ops paratrooper. What can\u2019t wait, however, is the luxury leather goods business he inherited from his father.The business is being newly bilked by the Mafia. Not the perfunctorily threatening Jewish Mafia to which Copeland Leather and every other manufacturing business in the building has been accustomed to paying off. This is the deeply serious and deadly Mob. Which has singled out Copeland Leather for extortion. One day, while traveling on the Staten Island ferry, Harry spies a beautiful woman in white and falls immediately and hopelessly in love. She is Catherine Thomas Hale, of the Manhattan and Hamptons Hales, an heiress and Broadway ing\u00e9nue. Catherine is strong, moral and wise. She meets Harry\u2019s love and passion measure for measure. They are not really star-crossed lovers: Harry is a Harvard man, after all. But he is a Jew and he is broke - facts he and Catherine cannot long hide from her family. But this is more than a love story. It is a tale of a city at a golden moment in time, when the memories of two wars and the Depression remain vivid enough to fuse gratitude and caution, yet cannot stop the momentum of power and wealth that rocket New York inexorably forward as the steward of all things modern.It is a thriller, where thugs with Thompsons are pitted against combat heroes with iron nerves; it is a war set piece, where a band of brothers plummet into the mists and mud of western France; it is a window into a world of grand society, where money can buy everything but peace of mind and integrity. It is true, Helprin uses six words when two would suffice, but never once does the sprawl, the grandiloquence, feel like an attempt to dazzle or distract. The gorgeous language wraps, not traps, the reader; the descriptions of characters and settings put the reader fully inside a moment, most of which you want never to end. In Sunlight and In Shadow is romanticism at its soft-focus, golden-hued, unapologetic best. Characters are a little more beautiful, dangerous, erudite and talented than real life could afford; food is more delicious, sunsets more vivid, memories more precise and comforting, It is a novel for pleasure-seekers, for readers ready to sink into a web spun by a story-teller. Logic and relativism need not apply; only good guys, bad guys, truth and beauty allowed."}, {"userName": "Boris Feldman", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6370810-boris-feldman", "userReview": "The editor should be shot.Oh, wait -- maybe there was no editor.Helprin has long been one of my favorite authors. I read this book in an Advance Review Copy. All 700 pages.I hated it. The language, which the cover describes as \"lyrical,\" is pretentious and overblown. I get the title. Do you have to include the words \"sun,\" \"light,\" or \"shadow\" on every page? Almost every paragraph?The kernel of the story is engaging. This would have been a pretty good 250 page book. At 700 pages, with diversions that should have been left on the cutting-room floor, it was torture.I'm sure the hype surrounding this book will be intense. Just read the Prologue.

Helprin\u2019s writing reminds me of novelists from an earlier age where things were more leisurely and people had time and patience to read longer books. The Victorian Age? Helprin indulges in digressions which might sound potentially boring but almost every time he makes a stunning observation. This isn\u2019t a book you\u2019ll want to skim. Let yourself ease into its pace and you\u2019ll be rewarded in my opinion. The depictions of New York and its inhabitants are especially vivid though it\u2019s a city that has been described so times by so many authors. There\u2019s a magical quality to Helprin\u2019s \u2018take\u2019 that\u2019s just shy of fanciful. Harry Copeland, a returning World War II vet, is seeking retribution for a wrong that has been done to him, though, thankfully, retribution is not the main theme of the book. At heart this is a love story between two people from different walks of New York life, Catherine comes from society\u2019s elite, Harry, is middle class from people who fought to attain that status. And he\u2019s Jewish which in 1946 still carries a stigma. He\u2019s also fought in a war to help annihilate this prejudice and free the people who suffer/suffered because of it. He\u2019s not willing to stifle his standards. When he and Catherine get together it\u2019s electric and immediate. The rest of the world seems to falls away yet they\u2019re eventually forced to deal with things like the fianc\u00e9 she\u2019s jilted and the failing business Harry\u2019s inherited from his father.Overall this is a workmanlike novel. I\u2019m not meaning any disparagement by that. Helprin uses his plot to hang lots of insights and beautiful vignettes upon and there are parts that soar as when he describes Catherine rehearsing for the musical she\u2019s going to be in or Harry\u2019s experiences as a pathfinder in World War II. Another part that stood out concerned how two out of towners experience New York for the first time. Helprin doesn\u2019t neglect any part of the City; he takes you from working class to high class life and everything in between. There are layers to New York that create its lushness just as there are layers to \u201cIn Sunlight and in Shadow\u201d; all of them necessary, many of them dazzling.There is an over idealization of women with an emphasis, of course, on young women as the ideal. There are characters that show up for what seems like no reason other than they were pretty girls. The love story dips into extremes at times and just misses being caricature. In my opinion what Helprin does well he does so, so well he can\u2019t be faulted for the less than perfect parts. I was reading an Advanced Reading Copy so perhaps some of this was edited out by time it went to print.This review is based on an e-galley provided by the publishers.3.5/5 stars"}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/744602-lori", "userReview": "Helprin has written some of my favorite books, and nobody can write as beautifully, as lyrically as he can. I form more images in my mind from him than most others. And this is a book about falling in love, it's been a long time since I fell in love and reading this I am transported back.BUT so far I'm annoyed by all the speechifying in what's supposed to be dialog. We'll see what happens. 11/3 - god I can't believe I'm giving a Helprin 3 stars. But 3 stars means I LIKED IT! I've been pondering the rating for a few weeks now. I mean, the writing is so spectacular, and in this case the flashbacks to WW2 are spectacular. The descriptions are crystalline. Helprin has returned to this, as in SOAGW. It's like he's combined the WW2 aspect of that book with the 2 main characters of Winter's Tale but here ISAIS they never really breathe and live for me. The are Ideal so I couldn't get wrapped up in the love story and that's a shame because the love is the heartbeat of the book. Still Helprin always reminds me of my own ideals, which is to live in the present moment, participate in the beauty of life and the universe, and bring that beauty to others."}, {"userName": "Matthew Roche", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6007782-matthew-roche", "userReview": "This book made me angry.There, I said it.I loved Helprin, especially A Soldier of the Great War. I tolerated two-dimensional female characters and wandering plots just for the opportunity to feed on his magnificent prose. There was no modern peer for his descriptions of the Alps or gilded age New York City.But then came Freddy and Fredericka, which I barely tolerated, and then this cumbersome lump of dross.I cannot begin to express what an astonishingly bad book this is. Characters so wooden I wanted to carve them into bat and knock myself out just for the sense of relief. A plot that would have been hackneyed in 1946. And sheer, unadulterated boringness. But the most offensive part is that his great lyrical gift has turned into absurdity. His characters are incapable of expressing emotion, or even making us give a s**t whether the exist or die in a hail of gunfire. This is a fatal flaw in a love story, where at the very minimum we should expect characters capable of evoking and expressing emotion through their own thoughts, speech and deeds. As a result, Helprin vainly tries to make their preposterous love believable by ceaseless over-narration.Here's a tip: If you have to write the phrase \"They loved as no others had loved before\", you have lost. If you write it every 2-3 pages, you make us want to commit some sort of ceremonial act of self-violence simply for the escape. Show us, don't tell us.I am done with Helprin."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "In conclusion: Unfortunately, I cannot whole-heartedly recommend this book to everyone, even though I loved parts. Some of the writing is beautiful and thought provoking, but there are verbose, sentimental, overly dramatic and sophomoric passages too. Whole chapters could/should have been completely eliminated. This book needs editing. The dialog IS often funny, but neither these clever lines nor the wonderful depiction of NYC save the book. Every single woman mentioned is idealized. The two primary characters are beautiful, diligent, hard-working, moral, humble ....in other words simply too good to be true! The plot-line is sometimes long and drawn out, e.g. the war chapters, while the end is abrupt, unsatisfying and sappy. So much more could have been done with the ending. I personally have no complaints with the narration of the audiobook by Sean Runnette, although my guess is that others will find it extremely slow. I thought the dialogs were in fact improved by the narrator's ability to catch the personality and class of the character speaking. It is the author's theorizing that is slow and ponderous, and this is not the narrator's fault.So, how many stars? Parts I loved! I really did.....but then other parts were so overblown and never-ending. I am giving it three stars and recommending it to those readers who love NYC and philosophical tracts.********************Through chapter 37:I am not thrilled by the chapters and chapters and chapters depicting warfare in Europe. They go on and on and on. Boring and terrible, dreary rather than exciting or interesting! Another minus - women are ridiculously idealized. So the book is not perfect. Maybe if I complain it will change? I hope so.and..... Even the lines have lost their beauty and become, in my ears, pretentious:She was no different from Harry, when before the jump, hands in the same position, head bent or upraised, he leaned into his reserve shoot, as the plane rose and fell in the wind, and he too not quite prayed, asking for nothing. From Catherine and from Harry came absolute surrender, and to Catherine and Harry came the deepest strength. The current was strong and magnetic, the exchange electric and warm as everything came alight from what the blind of spirit took for darkness. Catherine felt her heart swell with strength and love\u2026.Both Harry, in his parachuting from airplanes and fighting in battles, and Catherine fighting her own battles against injustice, are being compared and united in a common struggle. Both pray. For me the tone has become sophistic. The philosophical reasoning has gone over-the-top. This is rapidly going downhill. The magical prose has become soppy gibberish. Disappointing....but if I praise the start of a book and it then goes down-hill, I must report that too. Maybe I simply lack the religious faith necessary to appreciate these lines? However it is not just these religious lines that are sophomoric. Some of the prose glorifying music, beauty, love, goodness, honor are quite simply over-blown. Then I listened some more and the scene shifts back to NYC....the description of NYC is wonderful ..... and then humor is thrown in. Catherine asks Harry for a definition of a nudnick! Harry's definition will surely make you laugh. Very funny! And she, Catherine of course, reads a digit wrong in her cookbook. With little cooking experience, given all the servants in her very wealthy family, she hasn't a clue how to cook a chicken. She puts it in the oven for 6 hours. You've got to laugh! So I guess my views are mixed on this book. Parts I absolutely love; other parts make me moan with frustration and yawn with boredom. I would have appreciated better editing. ***********************Through Chapter 23:I haven't quite made up my mind about the quality of the audiobook's narration. I love the tone of Catherine when she is REALLY mad. This lady, when truly annoyed, spits out lines that are scathing! The narrator's tone is spot-on! I like the s-l-o-w-n-e-s-s of the narration, but will others? I need it to give me time to think about what is being said. However there is often a peculiar upward lilt that is strange. This book may annoy those readers who just want to follow a plot. This is a book where the author leads you off in all different tangents, taking quick perceptive psychological mini-trips. I just finished chapter 23 - \"The Settee\". It covers everything from Franklin D. Roosevelt, sensual love, acquiescence versus combat, religious discrimination to pride and the need to be financially independent. That is a wide range of subjects, isn't it? You will either love the writing or you will hate it. I love it. I was going to start copying the lines here, but I would have to copy the entire chapter. It went from one wonderful line to another. From one topic to another.The humor is perfect. Catherine's father knew FDR. There is the funniest story - tickling and being dumped into water.... The story is all imaginary. It is both hilarious and has a great message; one little story rolled into the rest of the chapter's events. Remember this chapter when you read the book and tell me if you too love it. Oh yes, I forgot to mention another funny line, about the color of Roosevelt's advisors. Read the book!Some people may be annoyed by the philosophical meanderings. I am trying to warn off those readers who KNOW they prefer plot driven books; all the diversions will most probably drive them bonkers! ******************In Chapter 9:I am loving this, and I am kind of surprised. It starts with a ridiculous infatuation. But even if it is ridiculous, I like it! It is the writing. I actually believe that Helprin has captured how crazy people act when they fall head over heels in love.There is humor. And it is my kind of humor.Everyone knows of the \"Roaring Twenties\", and why the behavior of this period was a consequence of having survived WW1. Why is there so little literature about how people behaved after WW2.....other than books on the travails of the Jewish emigrates? This book seems to delve into this very topic. Hasn't there occurred a similar change in behavior and view on life after WW2? These people, those who survived the war, are the age of my parents. Fascinating to see why my parents thought as they did, looked on life as they did and made the choices they did.Read this. Harry is back from the war. He is crazy for Catherine and Catherine for him, but she is about to be engaged to another. That future had been planned ten years ago. Do you simply accept past plans? What was good then is not now:\u2026sea, air and sun having evaporized everything but memory. He stopped in front of a black shoe missing its laces. It was preserved well enough that with some softening and polish it might have been back in service. The heel was hardly worn. He thought that had things gone differently it might have been his shoe and that someone else might have been standing in front of it as a grave, grasping the lapels of his tuxedo in a tight grip and pressing a bottle of champagne close to his thigh, as if he were the one who was dead, he spoke to himself, the one who was living, urgently charging him with life. He let the breeze force its way into his lungs and looked ahead at his objective\u2026.. (chapter 9) After living through the war, would one just accept that which has been planned? Wouldn\u2019t one go after what one really wants? At least you\u2019d give it a hard fight!Another book that takes place in NYC right after the war. I am loving the feel of the city, since I lived there in the fifties. I am right back there, in a place I recognize. I feel the city, its odors and sights and the whole \"NYC atmosphere\"! ************************After only one chapter: He had long known that to see a woman like this across the floor in receptions or in gatherings is as arresting as a full moon was arising within the walls of the room, but this was more arresting yet. And what was a beautiful woman? For him beauty was something far more powerful than what fashion dictates and consensus decrees. It was both what creates love and what love creates. For Harry, because his sight was clear, the world was filled with beautiful women whether the world called them that or not. (chapter one)I am already sucked in by the language. Mark Helprin can certainly write! I love lines that make me think. By writing down these lines, listening carefully to the narrator, Sean Runnette, of the audiobook, I realize that reading a paper book gives you more time to ponder, to let your thoughts fly where they will, but Runnette\u2019s narration is very slow. With excellent prose that is a plus!"}, {"userName": "Hayley", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8490091-hayley", "userReview": "I'm unsure of how to write a review for In Sunlight and in Shadow since it is, for lack of a better testimony, the book I've been searching for. Without question, it is now my favorite book and I have no doubt it will continue to be no matter how many more novels I read in my lifetime. It is more beautifully written than I could have imagined and I'm in true mourning for the characters of which I can no longer spend my days with. Even though I'm positive the pages will crease and fade over time due to my countless re-reads I'll never be able to experience this flawless story for the first time ever again and because I recognized that early on (around page 20) I read as slowly as possible, for the first time in my life, because I couldn't bear for it to end. I could go on and on about the qualities that should be appreciated and recognized by everyone (exquisite imagery, soul wrenching prose and countless lessons of life that you can't help but draw from, hours and even days after you've finished the final word), but I won't because I can't do them justice and mostly, while incredible, those aren't the reasons why I will follow every word of Helprin's forever. In Sunlight is the best book I've ever read because I understood every rhythm, felt every word, laughed at every joke, marveled at all its genius and cried for every heart-breakingly beautiful moment, of which there are too many to count. Helprin's story and its vivid characters spoke to me as no other novel, and honestly most of my real-life events ever have. To put it simply Helprin is a master, I will always be a follower and as anyone's favorite book should achieve, In Sunlight and in Shadow awakened my soul and changed me entirely."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "The first time I sunk into one of Mark Helprin\u2019s huge, atmospheric novels I wondered how it was this man was not better known. But he is well known as a maker of epics, I just didn\u2019t know it then. That first brush with Helprin was A Soldier of the Great War which so enraptured me I thought I\u2019d never read another that was as good. Later, a professor friend of mine told me he \u201ccouldn\u2019t get through it.\u201d Older now, I wonder if it isn\u2019t the fantastical quality of the romance, or the steel thread of Ayn Rand-like self-reliance that runs through his work that put my friend off.Helprin, having attended Harvard, Princeton, and Oxford, has had access to the lives of the monied classes and unashamedly uses that access to create lavish sets for his novels. His insights into this exotic world waltz us off into dreaming how it would be if\u2026which might actually be more fun than actually living in that constrained and rule-bound world. To be reassuringly safe from the vicissitudes of having enough to eat or clothes to wear, this is the stuff of romance. I am less susceptible to those fictions now, but I can see its attraction for many. This is another impossibly romantic tale centered on a great love between a New York Brahmin and a New York Jew. We are treated to the lush scenery of a minutely-observed post-War New York City, and to the problems encountered by small businessmen trying to keep their businesses viable while paying out protection monies on a weekly basis. The outlines of Helprin\u2019s characters are carefully and completely drawn, and are then filled in with great swathes of color and fabric and angled light\u2014that sunshine and shadow comes at us from every direction. What I noticed and celebrate again is Helprin\u2019s unequalled ability to observe and then relate the way the water in the wake of a ship, for instance, curls and moves and vaporizes, indicating current, direction, wind speed, tide levels\u2026so much is caught in his web of words we can taste the salt spray. It leaves me gasping.Helprin takes his time over this novel, moving back and forth in time, as expansive on the state of play in the garment district of New York as on the honeyed beaches of Long Island. There is a brilliant set-piece in which the aspirant for the hand of the heiress meets her parents for the first time. They eat dinner at the beach house on Long Island and the conversation is so elliptical and constantly shifting that one feels the danger in the meanings behind the words like hidden shoals upon which one might be wrecked. The cast of characters is large, but completely manageable in Helprin\u2019s hands. We get Manhattan: the theatre district, the garment and financial districts, the shops, the bustle, the 1950\u2019s coffee shops with menus and waitresses. It is a brilliant reconstruction that must tempt more than one filmmaker to try it on. But it is too large a thing for a film; others have already tried to make films of Helprin\u2019s novels (A Winter\u2019s Tale), and they must realize it is too\u2026hopelessly romantic for our hard-bitten and seen-it-all audiences today. I listened to the audio of this novel, and it went on for days while I worked on endless tasks. The inflectionless voice of the narrator, Sean Runnette, was not appealing at first, but this is a long story, and perhaps his style is what was needed. It was a little like being read to by one\u2019s parent at bedtime instead of by a professional reader. Not what one would have chosen, but it becomes familiar. Helprin is still writing epics and he has a unique viewpoint that gives us romance like no one else."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/561587-jessica", "userReview": "I love Mark Helprin. \"Winter's Tale\" is probably my favorite book of all time - at least in the top 5 - and I love \"Memoirs of an Ant Proof Case.\" If you haven't read Mark Helprin, please pick up one of those books. Do not pick up this one as your first experience with him, since it may be your last.It was not a terrible book, but I was very disappointed. It was a love story, but my main problem with it was that he told us about how much these two were in love, rather than show us. There was a lot of explanatory text - a lot - talking about how he loved her because of the way she buttoned her shirt or because of the curl of hair on her neck or because the world made him love her so, but I didn't really feel their love, didn't see it.Unfortunately, I wouldn't really recommend this book. There were some good scenes, and I thought the ending was handled well, which is why I gave it 3 stars, but I wouldn't read it again.If you like WW2 fiction (there's just a little of that in this book and they are the best scenes), I would recommend Helprin's other book \"Soldier in the Great War.\" That was a great novel."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2158611-stephanie", "userReview": "Profoundly disappointing. Mark Helprin wrote a novel about New York that actually changed my life: Winter's Tale is such a gorgeous fairy tale, and such a compelling portrait of New York City, that I carried its images and its story with me when I moved to New York a few years after first reading it. I've read all of Helprin's other novels, and I do love his way with description, but none of the others stuck with me the way Winter's Tale did.So when I picked up In Sunlight and in Shadow, I thought that Helprin was going to give me another dose of what I loved before: a magical story that brings out the magic and beauty of NYC. Instead I plowed through a ponderous tome over-stuffed with his fabulous descriptions, but light on story and character description.Some pet peeves: the main male character, Harry, is a paragon. What in writing classes is sometimes referred to as a \"Mary Sue\", the character that is perfect in every way and can do no wrong. He runs six miles, sometimes twelve on some days, and swims a mile on others; he loves the city; he is tall and strong; he was a paratrooper; he's determined to save the business he inherited (even though he shows little interest in or aptitude for the business itself, and indeed rarely goes to work); he believes that wrongdoers should be punished. Oh yeah, and he's in love with a beautiful woman. The main proof of his character seems to be that he works out every day. Because being disciplined and athletic means you are also trustworthy and of good moral character, I guess.Catherine, the female protagonist, is also a paragon, though slightly more interesting than Harry, in that she sometimes blurts something out or makes a foolish choice. But mostly she is beautiful, and the outer beauty of a woman represents the beauty of her inner soul, Helprin tells us again and again. I think one-tenth of this book was comprised of elegies to the things that women represent. Especially beautiful women, who are of course the only ones worth talking about. It got old quickly. I really prefer books in which the female characters do things. Catherine does one thing--she's an actress--and she does it quite well, we're told, but Helprin compares her courage in stepping onstage after a bad review to the courage of soldiers going into battle, which I felt was stretching it to the point of insult. (Oh, she also swims regularly, so clearly has a sterling character. And she's an heiress.)The story ends abruptly after an interminable march of description and flashback and more description and the cliched juxtaposition of happy scenes with scary scenes and we learn how things turn out for the two main characters, but never hear a word about all of the rest of the people who have been touched by the story. And in a 700 page novel, there are plenty of people in the story to be concerned about.Most of them more interesting and more realistic than the protagonists."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12189479-chris", "userReview": "Mark Helprin is a genus with the English language. I also believe Helprin is ambitious with the subject matter he tackles. In his latest novel Helprin really tries (and comes as close as I think you can get) to put on a page what it is like to fall head over heals in love. The emotions, sights, smells, tastes, and over all energy involved with a romantic infatuation danced off the page for me. The journey that followed, of a life filled with courage, honesty, and sacrifice made me want to be a better person. If you want a quick page turner that does not require much attention then this is not the book for you. If you want to read literature, to glimpse into the heart and soul of this brilliant author and be taken on a journey that will be a part of your own heart then you will enjoy every page. I disagree strongly with the negative reviews. Especially the negative mention of A Soldier of the Great War (ASOTGW) which (along with Winter's Tale) I consider Helprin's masterpiece. ASOTGW changed my life. In fact, when I retired from the US military after serving 20 years I took my family overseas to Italy to see a painting hanging in a Venice museum. It was that kind of book.

The writing I normally enjoy is plain and straightforward and simple in the unadorned sense. What Helprin does here takes writing on a completely different level, perhaps not a higher plane, but separate. His words are musical, rising and falling, swelling with crescendos and whispering pianissimo. He paints murals with broad sweeping stroke and lush colors that make you feel if you just stretched our your arm, you could touch and taste and smell it all.This story is a love story, but not a romance. Or maybe it is a romance, but in the old fashioned sense when romance meant more than just heaving bosoms and throbbing manhoods and Hallmark greeting cards. It has all the heart pounding and sweaty palms of initial glances and nervous hellos and first kisses. It has the passion and strength and endurance of true love that will last the erosion of time.It is a tribute to WWII, to all veterans of all war, the men and women who give their lives, their futures, their dreams for something bigger. It painted a picture of those who survived and what shaped them into the parents of the Baby Boomer generation.Lastly, it is a love story to New York City. I have been to many great cities all over the world. I have seen many Wonders of the World, modern and ancient, natural and man-made. And nothing seems to inspire the love that NYC inspires. And having been several times to NYC, Helprin's depictions of this glorious place gives me the sense of actually standing in the center of Grand Central Station or Broadway despite his city being several decades older (younger?). The reason for the loss of a star is that with all this wonderful (truly beautiful writing), he loses his way in the storytelling. He goes on one too many tangents, takes one too many detours. This doesn't ruin the story as a whole, but the ending, which should have swelled into a magnificent rush the way it feels when you finally get to have that first kiss with the (wo)man of your dreams after weeks of patient hand holding, was slightly anticlimactic because it took just a smidge too long to get there.But I am so glad I read this. The world is full of cynics and critics and people who are looking for ways to tear you and it down. It is refreshing to read something that reminds me why I want to wake up every day....\u201cin the end the whole world is nothing more than what you remember and what you love, things fleeting and indefensible, light and beautiful, that were not supposed to last, echoing forever.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/686332-sara", "userReview": "This is the end for me and Mark Helprin. This book is so utterly boring that I was able to skip a 100 page flashback and not have it impact the telling of the tale in any way. The two main characters, swept up in an unlikely and unrealistic love, are so redolent of their own smugness that by the end you loathe both of them. They are physically perfect, morally perfect, sexually perfect, socially perfect, intellectually perfect, militarily perfect....it goes on and on. The saccharine love story is so languorous and serpentine that you often lose interest only to be reminded later that A-HA! Everything is still excellent and going exactly according to plan and everyone is in love and harmony. Two small subplots never resolve, which would have been the least reward Helprin could have given us for forcing us to wade through 700 pages of purple prose and melodrama. The dialogue was ridiculous. It might be possible for people to have such elevated conversations occasionally, but in this book, everyone speaks from the highest plains of academic philosophy all the time. No one can just have a root beer float and a tortilla, they have to have the most poetic tortilla ever imagined followed by a root beer float which serves as an analogy of the love man must have for nature to be a truly whole spiritual being or some such tripe. The female protagonists discovery that she is Jewish, and not in fact the Uber-WASP she was raised as, is handled in such a RIDICULOUS manner as to be laughable. Also, after 500 pages of their moral one-upmanship, the plot resolves by committing an act that is not only grievously immoral, but is justified as the \"only way\" to live an honorable life. What's worse, the \"protagonist\" drags his army buddies into it, and a massacre ensues, which the men on the \"moral high ground\" feel absolutely justified in committing. It is an appalling lack of cohesion in the barely there fabric of the story. I actually feel insulted by this book, and regret reading it. I feel that Helprin has become lazy, and diguises his lack of interest in story telling with such burdensome scene setting that it isn't even a novel, but more of a travelogue.

Like Winter's Tale, this novel celebrates New York City, this time at a somewhat later period. The time is 1946 and the main character, Harry Copeland, is a well-to-do Jewish ex-soldier who's come home to run his father's leather goods business, his father having died while he was at war. (I couldn't help but note that Swede Levov, Roth's main character in American Pastorale, was also a business man in leather goods.) Harry, now in his early 30ies, had been in the special forces and fought his way from Africa to Sicily and eventually to the Normandy invasion, undertaking hazardous missions alone or with an elite team, been seriously wounded and had not exactly expected to survive. In 1942 in NY, he had two significant problems: his want of someone to love and be loved by and the need to save his father's business from the \"protection rackets\" which were largely unchecked by police or government in the city. And those two are related in ways that define who Harry Copeland is and how he will live his life.Visiting an aunt (his only relative and she not a blood relative) on Staten Island, he sees a woman on the ferry and falls in love with her before he even meets her. Their love story is the at the core of the novel and Helprin writes some downright purple prose in its praise, verging sometimes on sentimentality, but for me right on the edge with the focus of the horrendous need of human beings to love, especially after living through the nightmare of the century. The woman is Catherine, only daughter of a rich financier, engaged to marry the son of another rich financier; a recent graduate of Bryn Mawr she has been trained as a singer and is in a promising Broadway show. She too was stuck by seeing Harry on the ferry.Harry's business is threatened with ruinous protection payments, orders of magnitude higher than those his father had been paying or any other tenants of the same building are currently paying, enough to ruin the business within the year. There is no hope of help from authority. The mob rules in this kind of thing. But Harry's sense of honor and dignity and what he owes to his father's memory cannot just close the business down and leave, and eventually it becomes clear that the mob is taking orders from the ex-fiance who has also bribed the critics to ignore Catherine's talent and imply that her rich father bought her a Broadway debut.Love and honor denominate this novel and speak loudly to a generation that's learned to accept that neither is really possible in a world where return on investment trumps all. I recommend it highly. It's a moving story, a page turner and a tear jerker, but nonetheless honest.I rate it a 10 though I doubt the critics do. I think it might be time to read other Helprin novels since these this one and Winter's Tale have captivated me so completely. And if you're in love with New York, this one isn't to be missed. I'm not--London is the city I dream about--but I still respond to Helprin's obvious love."}, {"userName": "Judith Hannan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8166037-judith-hannan", "userReview": "In Sunlight and in Shadow is a long and bloated book. Ostensibly a story about love and honor it is also a tale of New York in post-WWII New York. Perhaps it was Helprin's intent to capture the energy of the time when the country felt ripe with possibility and New York City seemed the powerful energy behind it all. But it didn't work for me. In many ways, it reminded me of the work of Ayn Rand. All is idealized--love, women, valor, the city and \"Our Hero\" of course. Most unbelievable to me is the love/rapture/passion/adoration of the two main characters--Harry and Catherine--who meet on the Staten Island Ferry and instantly fall in love. Helprin tells us over and over again how perfect their union is, as if we won't believe him unless he pounds it into our heads. And we won't believe it because nothing is that perfect. It's a lazy way to write. Rather than Sunlight and Shadow, the issues and viewpoints in this book are presented in black and white. Helprin lectures and moralizes through long, wordy paragraphs and stilted dialogue. In one of the oddest scenes, when Catherine--an heiress who suddenly learns that she was descended from a Jewish grandmother through her mother and was therefore Jewish herself, declares her instant affiliation with all Jews \"who came before me, who lived in hovels in Eastern Europe ... Whatever I had thought about them before, now they're with me forever.\" Despite Helprin telling us that his characters are deepening and ripening, we don't see it in their actions, which, if the characters had truly been examining their souls, might have taken a different course. So why two stars and not one or none? Although Helprin's brilliance as a writer is obscured in this book, it is not totally invisible. While sentences that run for paragraphs or are as empty as describing the wind in Main as \"... fresh in a way that only thr northland can be,\" Helprin also describes the same air as better able carry oxygen \"... than air in the city, perhaps because it came off the ocean and was free of the many millions of rooms, tunnels, and cul-de-sac that in the city captured, tortured, and enslaved it.\"  The scenes of war, when Harry is reliving his past, are the better ones in the book. At the launch of a mission we see, \"With a thousand planes behind it, the C-47 faced an empty runway and the wind.\" When Harry parachutes from a plane, \"All was darkness, speed, and wind as he was washe clean, emptied out, and reset.\" There are many such sentences that pull you from the drudgery of the book but not enough, and even these serve the idealized messages Helprin is trying to convey.  This is not Winter's Tale or A Soldier of the Great War.

The heroine is a two-dimensional goddesses, who faced with her own challenges, only becomes more perfect.

Not every book has to be a page turner, but this book couldn't decide what it was. There were long periods of action and the story moving forward, and then abrubtly interrupted by a long internal monologue or a brief visit to a character who has nothing to do with the story at all that were jarring.Prose should serve the story, not hinder it. I found my attention wandering during several passages and I often skipped ahead, something I never EVER do as I like to let a story lead me and unfold on its own.I recognize that the characters were representative of certain virtues - the hero being the very picture of old chivalry and romance, but that did make them a bit unrelatable.

In 1946, Harry Copeland has returned after fighting in the 82nd Airborne from North Africa all the way to the Elbe. Reluctantly assuming the direction of the family fine leather goods manufacture, he finds his life unsatisfactory and on hold \u2013 until he is \u201caccidentally\u201d united with Catherine Thomas Hale, the woman for whom he has been waiting all his life, although the forces behind his patience have never been revealed to him. A young actress, singer, and heiress, she has been waiting for him, even if she has known this only in flashes that do not come clear to her until the end of the narrative, and that have not prevented her engagement to a much older man who has been taking advantage of her since childhood.The meeting of Catherine and Harry, their courtship, and their intense love, play out on the stage of New York awakening at mid-century \u2013 in the deep worlds of the theater, industry, and high finance, and during the collision of aristocratic New York society with the formidable wave of second-generation, fully assimilated Jews. Though after being broken in the war Harry wants nothing but peace, family, and love, organized crime carries on its extortions as always, even in a city now full of the kind of men who stormed the Point du Hoc and the Siegfried Line. This becomes his moral and physical struggle. While Catherine\u2019s is of a different nature, it is just as consequential, and the courage required of her is perhaps even greater.Of the widest scope \u2013 from the air over Sicily to the heat-and-color-saturated Sacramento Valley; the Bay of Biscay to the sea off Maine; the steel mills of Gary, Indiana to the beaches of Amagansett; London in the blitz; the invasion of Normandy; and a single shell gliding across an American lake in August; from the luminous houses of the wealthy to the pounding of the boards beneath a Broadway chorus line \u2013 this is yet, first, and foremost a love story, but also a hymn to New York of the period when one great age elided into the other that we call our own.
