I needed answers.\n\nYou said it, sister. I need answers too.2.5 stars. I didn't hate this book. I just ended up more confused at the end than when I started. How does this happen?Good Cop : This story has the potential to be interesting because it starts off (no spoiler here, this happens within the first couple of pages) with the girl's best friend dying in a car accident and following her home, only to haunt her house as a ghost that her family can see and converse with. It's like Casper the Friendly Ghost, except with a hot guy instead. Score!!! Bad Cop : Why is it never mentioned that the guy had any issues actually ADJUSTING to being stuck in someone's house as a ghost? Wouldn't most people be somewhat frustrated by this turn of events? All I saw was Frankie lounging around, ready at a moment's notice to comfort Ever when her nightmares would crop up. He was always coiffed with a glint in his eye, ready to be there for his \"doll.\"Good Cop : Even though this chick was named Ever, at least she wasn't a complete snooze like the chick named Ever from the book Evermore.Bad Cop : The chick was named Ever. *puke*Good Cop : Lana Del Ray was mentioned.Bad Cop : I was drowning in all of rockabilly and hipster details about these characters. I felt like I was forced into buying that every character was supposed to be unique and super-fascinating. Good Cop : The vampires going to vampire school reference made me think someone might be a Richelle Mead fan.Bad Cop : The \"poking fun at Twilight scene\" has been done to death. We get it - sparkly, stalking vamps are 'teh suck.' Good Cop : Speaking of Vampire Academy, I was intrigued by the huge age gap between Ever (17) and Toby (22). It (for a second) reminded me of Rose and Dimitri.Bad Cop : ...and there's a reason why age gaps don't always work for teenagers (unless you are awesome like Rose and Dimitri). Ever acted like a clueless child half of the time. She had no business dating anyone that old.Good Cop :The love triangle was balanced. I believe that Ever was honestly torn between both guys for good reason.Bad Cop : ...and then the love triangle was unbalanced. WTF?!? at the last few chapters.Good Cop :The start of the book was gut-wrenching and had me absorbed. The ending got completely crazy.Bad Cop : The middle of the book was a lot of blushing, running away, and make-out sessions with not much else going on.Good Cop : The ghostie got some good news.Bad Cop : The ghostie still had no real reaction to this news. SERIOUSLY, KID. When bad stuff happens, you don't react. When good stuff happens, you don't react. Is there nothing on your radar other than 'cute girl in front of you?'Good Cop : I have a lot of questions that need to be answered now, so I'm going to have to read book 2.Bad Cop : I have WAY too many questions that need to be answered now. I was told who everyone was and what they did, but I have no clue how any of it actually HAPPENED.Final thoughts : A weak first book that bordered on sappy in parts...yet, I do like the general idea for the world and where the plot is going to go. Both of the guys were somewhat likable, although I felt Toby to be more 'fleshed out' (HAHA...see what I did there? He's the human love interest.) as a character than his ghostly competitor. I think the series has promise if the next book focuses on more action and starts cluing us in on how this world is built. The lack of detail will hopefully be compensated for in the future. I'll give book 2 a shot. If it gets better, then we might have a promising thing going on. If the story doesn't improve, then I might part ways with the series.This book was provided from the publisher through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "MLE", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2761976-mle", "userReview": "[She brings Frankie back to life.

Ever is hung up on her best friend, Frankie, and he doesn\u2019t know it. Unfortunately, he\u2019s been dead for the last two years but is still present in her life as a ghost. Really makes moving on difficult. Ever hasn\u2019t had much of a life, she\u2019s been homeschooled ever since the accident that took her best friend, Frankie, and only connects to the outside world through her spunky friend Jess. Ever\u2019s never dated or even kissed any boys, and she\u2019s seventeen. Frankie is a constant presence in her life, always around at her house, and the reason she doesn\u2019t like to go anywhere. He can\u2019t leave. Her friend Jess tries to get Ever to move on with her life, encouraging her to be interested in boys that actually have a future. Jess and Ever\u2019s parents are aware of Frankie and even interact with him. This situation is about to change when a new boy, Toby, moves into the house once occupied by Frankie. Ever feels an immediate and intense attraction to him, and apparently he feels the same for Ever, he marches right up to her door after catching her looking, and asks her out (cue eye roll, one of many). Ever knows she can never have a future with Frankie, they can\u2019t even touch, but she still feels guilty over her feelings for Toby.I had such a hard time getting into this story and it wasn\u2019t until about 30% that I felt things started getting interesting. To me the first 30% was spent on describing the clothing and looks of every character, in EVERY scene; that or mooning over Toby and or Frankie, and lots of blushing. I really had no idea what direction the plot was moving until I was about half way through the book. This next part is completely my fault. I really should have paid more attention to the description of this story before I picked it up. It would\u2019ve been glaringly obvious that there was going to be a love triangle, a situation I have very little patience for. But this is not only love triangle, it\u2019s a quadrangle! Two guys, two girls: there\u2019s Ever and Frankie and Ever and Toby, then there\u2019s Toby and Ariadne. And Ever can\u2019t seem to choose, flitting back and forth between these two. I was totally annoyed how quickly things move from one boy to the other. Plus, you know when you can sort of tell which boy the character is going to end up with, the one you should be rooting for because more time is invested in that boy? You\u2019re made to like that one just a little more than the other. Well, in my opinion I was made to root for one, and the other won out in the end. There is a mysterious reason that Toby is in town and there is the issue of Frankie being a ghost. Why can Ever and her family see him? There were a lot of questions I had about all of this, and not a whole lot of answers. I was left at the end scratching my head and asking: Why? I can\u2019t go into my questions because it would spoil the plot, so I\u2019ll just leave it at that. So this story ticked the boxes on three things I normally can\u2019t stand in a story: insta-love, love triangle, and cliffhangers! Yes, on top of everything else we have a cliffhanger. Another pet peeve, while a small one, I just can\u2019t help myself and mention it: Character names. I can\u2019t stand it when an author chooses a difficult or almost unpronounceable name, like Ariadne in this case, because every time I come across it, it stops me! I have to mentally pronounce it each time, and wonder if I\u2019m saying it correctly. I know, I know, nit-picky! At any rate, while in some parts I was mildly entertained by this story, I doubt I\u2019ll be picking up the next in the series.

One thing for sure, this is definitely the worst book I've ever read (worse than Fallen, who would've thought so!). Urghhh...although I can write a very 'colourful' negative review, it doesn't mean that I like to write such review. More so now, when I myself directly involved in the creative process of publishing books as a beta reader. I hate it even more to write a negative review for a debut novel. But this, this is just intolerable.Dear Curiosity Quills Press, I had a 'pleasure' of reading Wilde's Fire halfway and a pleasure of reading and occasionally skimming Fade and Ever. While I'm very grateful for your generosity for offering me to review those ARCs, here are a few things that I want you to take note because I do notice some 'unhealthy' patterns emerging in your books;1. I think we had enough with Mary Sue heroines. It doesn't hurt to feature strong, independent female protagonists with more brain cells.2. Stupid, and I mean stupid love triangle. Love triangle doesn't equal to 'it's okay for the girl to date/flirt/make out with two boys in such a short time frame.3. Mysterious males with 'paranormal, mythical' true identity as the love interest.4. Insta love/obsession/soul mate or whatever you feel like naming it.5. Gross make out scenes EVERYWHERE in the book. I feel like stepping on land mines the whole time. I was just trying to get into the story and here we go again 'His lips covered mine' bullshit. Trust me, readers are not that stupid anymore to buy a book just to read the steamy, hot make out scenes because hey, there are a lot of post-Fifty Shades erotica books in the market! And trust me, the make out scenes in Fade and Ever are gross because the characters hardly know each other/they were best friends before! Real relationship needs development, people!6. You are in dire need for unique, attractive book title. How do you know if that book title is not a good idea? Search that title on Goodreads and your book isn't among the top five hits. 7. On the plus side (hey, finally!) the cover for your books are quite decent. Keep up!Okay, back to Ever. This is my pre-morning book (I like to wake up around 3-4 am to read. Pre-morning inspired by Sheldon Cooper's pre-evening definition because when I say early morning, people imagine 7-8 am), not my plane book, or my between classes book, or my 'I can't sleep so I'm reading' book. Which meant to say that this book had my full attention. I even read this during my stay in Port Agusta (such a lovely place!) which meant to say that I was in peaceful mood without any assignments plaguing my mind. And what did I get? An awful, awful experience. I even decided to get back to sleep because of the horror! And ended up having nightmares. And I had to try so hard not to let it ruin my mood the whole day for the sake of my travel buddies. True story bro. Usually I do agree that reviews/ratings are subjective and whenever I hate a book, I would still recommend my other Goodreads friends to read that particular book just to know other people's point of view. But I don't dare to do that for Ever case because I don't want anyone else to undergo the emotional trauma that I had.Okay, just to prove that I'm not exaggerating, I beg the author/the readers to read my summary of Ever. Granted, summarizing can take things out of context but I just don't care anymore at this point.***Spoilers ahead***Frankie, Ever best friend had passed away for two years but strangely he (or his apparition) still lingers in Ever's house. Neither Ever nor Frankie know why Frankie's soul couldn't move on. Ever claimed Frankie is the first and the only guy she ever love in her lifetime. Ever's choice of best friend is interesting because Jessie changes boyfriend as often as I have to mow my damn lawn and she only wears pink. Not that I have a problem with that but wait until I describe Jessie's behaviour.Ever (I don't know..complains? rants? mentions?) that she will never have an embarrassing make-out story-let alone sex because apparently she has given Frankie her heart all those years ago.*snorts*Enters Toby, the new guy on the block who moves into Frankie's old house. Ever's first thought '\"Toby,\" I whispered. Yes. I liked the way that sounded, almost as much as I liked the way he looked. Wow.\"Note that this quote came only a few pages after Ever said Frankie possessed her heart for years. Yawn.(And I think Elenoar is a nice name. Why Ever thought it's an embarrassing name? Can someone bother to tell me why?)That night, Ever went for a movie with Jessie. But she couldn't concentrate to the movie. Why you asked me? Because her attention, 'unfortunately' was on the hot guy next door! Even more imaginative than usual, her mind started making up all sorts of different things about him, and Ever found herself creating and playing out scenarios in my head about how the two of us would meet and what would come next.Unbelievable.Next page, Ever thought 'I didn't know why, but I found myself really wanting to touch him'Toby came to approach her, asked her out, but she refused because she said she has a boyfriend.Ever saw Frankie looked broken after her little conversation with Toby and she wondered why? That night, Ever had a nightmare and she was calling Frankie's name. Of course, Frankie appeared on her bedroom but then he saw Ever was only in her underwear. \"I watched his gaze slowly travel over me. He seemed captivated by my lack of clothing, and took his sweet time before meeting my gaze.\"Oh, now the ghost is getting horny too. The next morning, despite the rejection, Toby gave Ever her favourite flower, anemones. Of course Ever went nuts wondering 'How do he knows my favourite flower' and all that. Then, Ever thought 'only crazy person would allow herself to continue obsessing over someone long after he'd died. Sane people focus on things they actually can attain, like relationships with living people. Like Toby'Note that this happened only the morning after Ever thought 'Was I imagining the heated look in his (Frankie's eyes because I wanted to see it there so badly?\"Back to Jessie, the first thing she asked regarding Ever's new neighbour was did Toby ask Ever out. Eheh. We could all use a friend like that, do we?And here's Jessie's word of wisdom '...we are seventeen years old. We are supposed to be dating and having fun. Susan says - in one of the only bits of advice I'll even bother with - that we should be dating multiple guys at a time! Multiple.\"Yay, and then we could all have multiple STDs. Hooray!Seriously.After numerous useless references to colour pink and legging, Ever encountered Toby again. And she wondered what brand of shampoo he used. Because Jessie with all her intelligence managed to set Ever on a 'date' with Toby in the name of 'showing him around', Ever stuck with Toby that very night. Toby even added that hopefully Ever's 'boyfriend'' won't mind.A few blushes, tongue-tied moments with several thoughts back to Frankie, the date is over. The next morning, Ever was woken up by Frankie (Believe me, Frankie serves nothing except for Ever's personal alarm clock at this point) and Ever thought she wished she could hold Frankie and Frankie felt the same way too. Moving on, someone knocked the door and Ever opened it. And it was Toby. What did Ever thought? 'I found myself blushing at the thought of what he might sleep in. Flannel pajama bottoms...boxers...nothing at all.'Wow, Frankie just got totally friend-zoned by the horny Ever. And oh, I forgot to mention that Toby came to invite Ever for their second date. At this point, I don't know what happened to the 'fake boyfriend' story anymore. Of course, Ever had her first kiss in only her second date. How romantic.Next, Ever parents get all worked up by the fact that her seventeen years old daughter is dating a twenty-two years old guy. Hmm..I don't know. I thought this is normal? Except if that 22-years old guy is Ever's teacher?After throwing a tantrum, Ever went back to her room to reply Jessie's 'OMG, EVER!' e-mail. Frankie appeared and asked where she'd been and she lied to Frankie. And I didn't understand why the lie is needed when Ever thought there's no hope between her and Frankie. Frankie sensed her lie and Ever got so defensive, it chased Frankie away. Of course, Frankie came back to comfort the crying Ever who at this very moment thought 'Frankie is her entire world'.And I didn't really understand what happened next, between the pink toenails and Jessie's scream 'Toby!!! I won't let some guy ruins my vacation with my best friend!!!\" And I thought Jessie was the one who set Ever up with Toby in the first place!Next, Frankie was trying to talk Ever into not going out with Toby for 'a reason he couldn't tell' (of course) and Ever replied 'Get out of my way and stay out of my life. I can see whomever I choose.'Remember last night when Ever thought Frankie is her entire world?And I also didn't understand what happened next, between Frankie trying to calm the crying Ever again because Toby hasn't call her but Toby appeared next carrying Ever favorite flower and kissing her senseless.Of course Toby didn't explain where he'd gone and of course Ever forgive him. A few small talks later, they kissed again. And kissed again. And kissed again.But brace yourself because the next morning Ever admitted that she was simultaneously feeling that same strong pull toward Toby and Frankie. That Frankie whom she yelled at the day before. And that very same day, Ever went out with Toby again. Seeing Ever, Toby kissed her again. Toby brought Ever's parents in his ride, quickly earning extra points for himself. Next, Ever and Toby started their real date on a ship. Next, they made out. At home, Frankie got upset because Ever went out with Toby.Next, on that night, Ever had a nightmare. Her mom had to calm her down by rocking her in that way she always did when she was a little girl.Okay, that basically what happened for the first 100 pages.Next 100 pages.Jessie's drama llama with her mom's boyfriend...Frankie told Ever not to go on a date with Toby again...she didn't listen because she wanted to be happy, she wanted to have a boyfriend (apparently happy and having a boyfriend is interchangeable in Ever's dictionary)...Jessie's family drama llama again...Ever and Jessie talk about Jessie's new boyfriend, Greg...Ever overheard Toby's confrontation with his 'dad'...Ever and Jessie's double date with Toby and Greg...Ever found out that Toby's ex is a psycho...Jessie's PDA with Greg...Ever and Toby kissed again once they got in the car...Oh finally some plot!Ever's dad got killed in a car accident!Cue the tiny violin sound because our Ever is broken and depressed. Cue the heroic sound because of course, Toby came to the rescue. Ever cried and cried and got aroused. Aha! She even thought she didn't want to be responsible, she wanted to go all the way with Toby! She even thought she loves him! Honey, everyone loves their boyfriend when they get horny.But Ever ruined that moment because she broke down and cried again! Classy. Toby accidentally spoke too much and now Ever demanded some answers. When he couldn't provide those, he dumped Ever! Minutes after they almost went all the way.Ever punched Toby. He left, and of course, Frankie was there to comfort Ever.Four miserable weeks, Ever longed for Toby. In the meantime, Ever's mom couldn't function anymore. To cheer Ever up, Jessie invited her to a party and introduced her to Scottie. And they made out too the very same night. Being Ever, of course she thought Toby was a better kisser.Blegh.To add to the awesomeness of the plot, Ever caught Toby making out with his ex, Ariadne. But suddenly, Toby got up and spoke for Ever when Scott asking Ever if she's okay. Ariadne introduced herself and of course Ever felt a pang of jealousy. But oh! Later that night Toby came to apologize and guess what, they made out again! And hey, what do we have here. Ever's mom knocking on her door when they just about to do it.Thank God.And then Frankie and Ever fight again. And then Ever realized that she'd always loved Frankie. lolwut?The next morning, Ever went to Toby's house and caught him just wearing a towel. And guess what? Of course they made out again. Ever and Ariadne had a fight...Toby and Ever kissed...Jessie threw a surprise party for Ever's birthday...Toby and Ever kissed in Haunted Mansion...Ariadne showed up in Ever's house...bringing her own surprise gift, Frankie in flesh not in a ghost form.Finally, we got a plot development.No, no, don't celebrate yet because what comes next was Ariadne kissed Frankie and Ever fainted at the sight.When Ever woke up, Toby came clear that he was a soul collector (well, this is apparently the big secret), and Ariadne too. In fact, Ariadne brought Frankie back alive to trade him for Toby. Funny thing was, this meant that Frankie's soul belongs to Ariadne now. Ever got so mad, she threw up, she shooed Toby away.As you may expect, Frankie came to console her and they relive they long lost love by having intercourse.Note that this happened a few hours after Ever was Toby's girlfriend.Well, I couldn't bother summarizing what happened afterwards until the end of the book because I'm very stressed out right now. I feel like puking and I'm losing my appetite. Summarizing Ever is like reliving my nightmare, so that's it. I got to stop now because it has taken toll on me."}, {"userName": "Annabelle Marie Veronica", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1235083-annabelle-marie-veronica", "userReview": "*****FINAL RATING: 4.65 STARS*****\nCATCHALL\nEver took me by surprise. When I started it, I had absolutely no idea what to expect. I didn't know at all what it was about, but once I dove into it I quickly found myself being pulled into its world. I was impressed by the originality of the story, and the characters were deep and people that I had no problem connecting with. It was an incredibly fun and yet emotional read, and I found myself laughing and crying at various points in the novel. I connected to it on a deep level and loved it.\nTHE HEROINE\nEVEREver was a seriously awesome heroine. Though she pines after Toby during their breakup, she doesn't turn pathetic about it. She stays strong throughout the whole thing. I love that. She's not some crumbly girl who needs a boyfriend to make her happy. She's a strong girl in her own right and I think that it would be impossible not to admire that. We all make mistakes, but for the most part Ever makes good choices and she always tries to follow her heart and do the right thing.\nTHE LOVE INTERESTS\nFRANKIEI adore Frankie. He's very, very sweet, and protective without being overbearing. He's caring, and sexy in that way that quiet guys are, understated but potent. Everything about him seems to be goodness, even though it's implied that he's hiding a few secrets under that soft exterior. But for the most part, he is very open and honest with Ever, always straightforward, but he doesn't bother when she doesn't want to listen. I like that he feels like he can tell her anything. It's easy to see that, even through Ever's eyes.TOBYToby is Frankie's opposite in nearly every respect, except is love for Ever, and possibly a few other things that I could have overlooked. Toby is dark. All about black and leather. But if you break down his exterior and look past that, he's also a very sweet and protective guy, but he expresses it and himself in a different way than Frankie does. At the same time, despite seeming like a stereotype trap, he's not a walking clich\u00e9. I can't really tell you how he isn't\u2014only that he isn't. He's a deeply developed character.\nTHE BEST FRIEND\nJESSIEI wasn't sure how I felt about Jessie for a long time, but I ended up liking her. She's fiercely loyal to Ever and she'll do anything for her. She isn't the type to flake and although she's portrayed as a bit flighty with guys, she is very different with her best friend. Her heart is in the right place and she always knows where she stands: with Ever. No matter what.\nTHE PLOT\nFrom the very first sentence, Ever drew me into her world. I was immediately dazzled. And that feeling of novelty didn't ever seem to go away. It was like the brilliance of the first time, all the time. And that mae reading this book a pleasure all around.And I loved the whole originality of it. I've really never read anything like it, which is so hard for me to say regarding paranormal romance these days because so many of them feel the same. Not this one. In a world and a genre where boring has taken over, Ever managed to not only be something special but to capture my heart.It didnt feel contrived or fake at all. Ever's story is a very real one. The boy she loves, Frankie, has been dead for two years. But he isn't gone. He's a ghost. And he lives in her house, keeping her company. Then, on the two year anniversary of his death, a boy and his father move into Frankie's old house. That would be Toby. And after that, nothing is going to be the same for Ever.There was action, but there was mostly a lot of emotion. Everything Ever did, and everything that happened to her was based at some level in deep emotion. It's not a shallow book by any means. It's a book that has to be invested in.Another thing I love is that this book is set in Southern California. I'm sure I've read other books set here, but not too many or I'd remember them. And it was really awesome to recognize the places they were talking about and picture everything.Another awesome thing? Ever's mom is named Annabelle.But I digress.\nTHE ROMANCE\nI love the romance. It's clearly a central part of this book, but it doesn't take over everything. It's important but it supplements the story rather than polarizing it. I really, really like that aspect of it. And although I have to say I'm leaning towards Frankie, I like that in this love triangle I'm still undecided because everything is so balanced! Ever has chemistry with both of these boys, and they both care about her in their ways. So I'm looking forward to see what the future will bring here.\nTHE WRITING\nI love Jessa's writing. I really, really do. Ever has a very unique voice. She's very much a teenager, and she's written perfectly in such a way that she doesn't come off as annoying or whiney. She's very much an independent girl and her voice reflects that. Additionally, Jessa's writing allows full characterization of secondary characters even through a first person POV, which isn't always easy to do. Besides which, her writing is just awesome in general. I love the description, and the dialogue was very fun, from the banter-y to the serious.\nTHE ENDING\nThe ending\u2026wow. Very sweet. Touching. Well, not the very ending. But there is a scene near the end that is very, very touching. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure why. But it really is. It brought a smile to my face. Probably because it felt so right. But the very ending, including the last line\u2026wow. It's a serious cliffhanger. I couldn't help but wish there was more right away! It was just unexpected enough but seemed plausible and not ridiculous. It was perfect.\nWRAPUP\nI absolutely loved Ever. It was an incredibly pleasant surprise and I will definitely be picking up the sequel! In fact, I will be desperately awaiting the sequel because I really, really, really want to know what is going to happen next. It was that good, people. Moreover, I completely and totally recommend this book. To be honest, it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea. No book is. But if you love your fantasy and romance, and you're looking for a unique paranormal romance, I'd definitely recommend checking this one one!FINE.Find more of my reviews on Sparkles and Lightning!"}, {"userName": "Susie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/446905-susie", "userReview": "For a more in depth review, head on over to my blog: http://susreviews.blogspot.comEver has a secret. 2 years ago her best friend Frankie and she were in a bad car accident.

When she meets Toby, things start to change.\u00a0Now, the book blurb sounds really appealing, don't you think?\u00a0I read the blurb and was interested, because it sounds dark and dramatic.\u00a0But the book itself doesn't quite measure up. It's not that I'm disappointed, because disappointment would suggest that I have an expectation that isn't met. I didn't have any expectation. I finished this book annoyed and irritated. I didn't like this at all and couldn't see anything good in it, to say the least.\u00a0I hated that the pages are filled with nothing going on. Dates, make-out sessions, lying, blushing, sneaking, etc. All these don't quite contribute to anything! Not even the plot! I didn't even like any of the characters. Ever seems to me a very\u00a0annoying person. The fact that her father's death doesn't bother her enough to talk about it or be sad about it bothers me to no end. After his death, she cries a bit and goes right back to being obsessed with boys. Are you kidding me? The best friend Jessie is a flat character whose only function is as Ever's personal cheerleader. And Toby, oh Toby, can you be any more cheesy? Sent on a job and falls in love with that job. Jeez.\u00a0In the end, I don't even know what this book is really about. Ghosts? No, not really, since the only ghost we see in the story is Frankie, and not that much attention is paid to him. Which leads to another disturbing question: why is he there at all? I mean, what's the significance? What's the point? You know, the whole ghost thing never fits seamlessly into the story. It always made me feel like it's out-of-nowhere and awkward. The whole book reads like a contemporary book, but then the ghost shows up and goes all \"What's wrong, Doll?\" or \"dollface\" or whatever, and then it's just weird. The ghost thing is displaced and everything else is very poorly done.\u00a0The most frustrating part of this book is when, near the end, something else ENTIRELY is introduced into the story that changed the book's direction. There has been no foreshadowing or anything, so this thing coming into play is just very forced and contrived. Like the idea just occurred to the author and she thought it would be fun to put it in the book, and then she did, and never went back to edit the whole book to make room or drop hints for this thing. You know what I mean? It's just bad. So throughout the course of \u00a0book, the story kept changing genre directions, and it's more than annoying. Contemporary? Paranormal? Fantasy? WHAT? And then before I could answer, it abruptly\u00a0ended, which totally caught me off guard. Excuse me? Is this supposed to make me feel like I'm hanging off a cliff and dying to read the next book or something? If so, I'm sorry to say that it unfortunately backfires.\u00a0Although this book sounded like something I might enjoy, it was the opposite. There's nothing about it that I enjoyed. The writing is mediocre; the plot is... wait, what is the plot?; the characters are weak and flat. I'm not glad I read it. If anything, I'm glad I got it over with and wish to have nothing to do with it ever ever ever again. Take that, Ever.I received a digital copy of this book from NetGalley and the publisher for review."}, {"userName": "Farrah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5705696-farrah", "userReview": "this review also appears on my blog at http://www.thegoldenruleof666.blogspo...Unexpected...but in a good way. Ever was a different book from the YA you normally see, and I think it worked out great.First, let me say that the cover is SO gorgeous. It's beautiful and ethereal and haunting. It matches up with the book so well. I had a major case of cover lust with this book. With this, it's totally okay to judge the book by its cover.But moving on...The idea this book is based off of-ghosts and souls-isn't new, but it is a new take, one that was well done. There isn't a cliche in sight where Ever is concerned. Ever was a very realistic character. She messed up, she made mistakes, she embarrassed herself. But that all made me like her more. I really started to feel for her, as if she was a real person. The author did a magnificent job bringing this character to life. Ever is flawed, but it didn't make me frustrated. Yes, her mistakes made me want to shake some sense into her a few times. But she would address them and try to make them right. And all of that contributed to shaping up her character. She was well drawn out, a character you can really like.The romance was...a whirlwind. This is one of the few times when I really don't know who to root for. Usually I know exactly who I think the heroine should end up with, but with Ever, I'm not so sure. Frankie is so ridiculously sweet and endearing. But, he's dead. Ever is in love with him, but she know that nothing could ever come of it because...he's dead. But he's still there, albeit in ghost form, so he still presents a challenge. Ever still sees him all the time, and her feelings never fade. Even as she's dating Toby, she feels as if she's betraying her love for Frankie. And then, at the end, it only gets more complicated when an unexpected occurrence shakes everything up. Seeing what I mean by a whirlwind? And I still haven't even talked about Toby.Toby was a as enchanting as Frankie, but in the opposite way. Whereas Frankie is a golden boy, sweet and charming, Toby is a bad boy, passionate and dangerous. Of course, Toby was still a sweetheart. He truly loved Ever and wanted to be with her, despite complications that I won't reveal. He was a roller coaster. He knows that he isn't supposed to get close to Ever, so he tends to push her away, only to come back. You'd think that would get annoying, and it did at first. But, when you find out the reason for all of it, it suddenly seems understandable. Where Frankie's relationship with Ever is soft and sweet, full of long-time love, Toby's relationship with Ever is a whirlwind, full of passion. Both had a lot of merit to me. And I still can't figure out which one I like best.The story was very interesting. There are twists along the way that you never see coming. The plot was original and fun. The ending was a total shock. I was completely floored. Now, I'm dying to find out what happens next.Loved Ever. It was spectacular.5/5Thanks to Negalley for a copy!"}, {"userName": "archdandy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4402720-archdandy", "userReview": "\"Exactly sevenhundred and thirty days had passed since the car accident took his life, and didn't take mine.\"Everstarts out with our main character, Ever, giving us a backstory on how she is in love with her best friend and former neighbour Frankie. There's just one problem, Frankie is dead and now she can see his ghost and he hangs around her house all the time. In fact, he can't go anywhere else. So how is a girl supposed to get over the love of her life when he is constantly around? Well it just so happens that Ever can get over him fairly easily. All it takes is a guy moving into Frankie's old house to forget about her feelings and start falling in love with Toby. I mean, for a girl who two seconds ago was saying that she would probably never have a boyfriend or fall in love again because your so madly in love with Frankie you sure jumped on the next boy you saw pretty quickly. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for her moving on in her life and finding somebody new, but it just seemed really unrealistic.  Young adult books in general to me seem really superficial and this one is no exception. There were some deep things mentioned in the first chapter or two but none of it was contemplated by any of the characters and it was basically just said briefly in passing. I mean, Frankie would probably have some feelings on the fact that his mother killed herself after his death and his father moved away. But all we get is Ever mentioning it and then moving on as if its not important at all. I felt myself wanting to get to know Frankie more but there were only small scenes that he was in. He was really the only interesting character in the book for me. Also one other gripe I had about the book is that Ever is 17 and Toby is 22. I know that in some relationships there can be a considerable difference in age but that seems a little too much for me. What would a 22 year old even want with a 17 year old? It just seems odd to me. I'm only 23 and I couldn't imagine even thinking about dating an 18 year old.  I only got about a third of the way through this book because I just found myself completely bored and checking how many pages I've read every two minutes. I know I'm an enjoying a book when I can go 50 pages and not even realize I had read that much. Ever just didn't do it for me. The only thing that happened during the amount of the story I read was that Ever and Toby went on three dates and kissed a lot. That is literally all. The first third of the story and that's all that happens? Sorry, but you've lost my interest and I'm not sticking around to find out if anything exciting actually happens in this story."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7591340-sarah", "userReview": "(Source: I originally received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis.

I will say that Ever did make a choice at the end of this book though, and it seems clear that she will be sticking with her choice, so hopefully the love triangle is 90% resolved!I liked the ending, even though it was a total cliff-hanger, and I\u2019m looking forward to the next book \u2013 Evade!Overall; great YA paranormal romance.7.5 out of 10."}, {"userName": "Alex Reads", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18251867-alex-reads", "userReview": "Ever had me tearing up, laughing and flustered all at the same time.

First off, how absolutely stunning is the cover? Honestly, it is gorgeous! Before I go into this review I want to say that I am Team Frankie 100% no matter how sexy and swoon worthy Toby can be. Oh, Jessa Russo what have you done to me?? THE BEST AND THE WORST ENDING EVER. I highly recommend you read this book but fair warning the ending will have you saying \"What the heck?\" and wanting book two right now. Ever is a book that has almost everything; humor, heartache, lust, love, passion, need, mystery, and suspense! It made me feel every emotion you can think of at some point. I was laughing at some parts and wanting to cry and yell at others. This book was anything but boring.I could not put this book down, I was up until four in the morning reading it last night because I needed to know what happened. At first we're introduced to Ever while she's sitting with her girl best friend Jessie who has a ton of spunk, and her DEAD male best friend Frankie who is drop dead sexy. My first thought is \"Wow, wouldn't it be weird to have a dead friend hanging out with you as if he wasn't dead?\" With something as crazy as that happening within the first chapter I knew this book was going to be interesting. We, thankfully, got to meet the swoon worthy Toby within the first few chapters. I was so thankful Jessa didn't make me wait to meet this mysterious guy. Ever had an instant attraction towards Toby but was conflicted and confused about it because she still loves Frankie. So walah we have a very complicated love triangle! I don't want to spoil what happens but it's a really fun aspect to have in the story.Jessie and Ever make me smile. There friendship is one that I wish I had with someone. They know each other so well they know what the other is thinking before they even voice it. Jessie is a really girly girl and Ever loves black so it's a very peculiar combination but it just works. Frankie is such a sweet guy, I love how he always tried to be there for Ever even when she had done something to upset him. Even though he smokes, which I find really unattractive, he's still swoon worthy and I'm hoping we get to know him a bit better in the second book. Toby is drop dead sexy, I absolutely love him. He has a tattoo, he's dark and mysterious, he has blue eyes. What's not to love? I just can't help being Team Frankie, he's Ever's child hood sweet heart and they've loved each other for such a long time.The story flows very well and it's never lacking action or suspense. I was guessing up until it was right there on the page for me. I am dying to read book two because I really need to know what's going to happen! I highly recommend you guys read this book. It wasn't supposed to be released until October 1st but I guess they decided to do an early release so it's available on Amazon and Kobo.Huge thank you to the publisher for providing me with a copy to read and review!"}, {"userName": "Lovey Dovey Books", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6011878-lovey-dovey-books", "userReview": "Ever is an original love story filled with heartache, teen angst, and paranormal mystery. Jessa Russo immediately appeals to emotion by opening with the saddest tale of love unfulfilled. Ever's best friend and first love, Frankie, is dead but still very much present in her life. Even though she can see him and speak with him, Ever suspects he'll never know just how deep her feelings are for him. When Ever decides to move on and turn her affection towards her new neighbor, Toby, her life is turned upside down and normal becomes an impossible dream.Ever is beautifully written and saturated in suspense. The clock counting down to something bad happening to Ever's attempt at a normal life ticks loudly. Russo's ability to write scenes that are literally filled with palpable tension or attraction is uncanny and really enhances the reading experience. Once one falls into the story, it's impossible not to become tangled in the game of tug of war played on the most fragile parts of Ever's heart. Russo unexpectedly gives so many reasons for increasing anticipation as Ever discovers the danger of her new relationship and struggles to fit the pieces together. Toby's secrets and unknown past are fuel to the fact that a great majority of the story is inconceivable yet so realistic.Sometimes it's just not possible, but Russo manages to create a book filled with easily lovable characters. Even the most villainous of the characters are perfect in this story! Ever is a stuck in a delicate point in her life but she's aware, and this makes her one of the most intriguing characters to read about. The novel is full of her presence and it's so wonderful to connect with the protagonist with such intensity. Toby and Frankie are both enigmatic and by the end of the story they're both still mysteries, but mysteries worth solving.Jessa Russo is definitely an author to follow.

Ever by Jessa Russo has one of the most beautiful covers I\u2019ve seen this year and it is a great book cover to judge because it\u2019s eerily haunting and befitting of the book\u2019s plot. This is one of the times I highly recommend judging a book by it\u2019s cover.Ever is an amazing book I literally stayed up most of the night reading it. I only stopped because my kindle died. The biggest downside of an ebook would be that. We start with meeting Ever whose best friend/love of her life Frankie died in her arms nearly 2 years ago. His ghost now occupies her house as a permanent resident and of course Ever has not moved on yet in her life of course from her love for Frankie. Though I don\u2019t think in her shoes I would have an easy time moving on either. I mean really what would you do if your best friend/love of your life died in your arms?Now the plot obviously doesn\u2019t only revolve around Frankie and Ever, but a new guy named Toby. It ends up becoming something pretty different and unexpected for someone who reads a TON of paranormal books. I honestly have not enjoyed a paranormal young adult this much in a very long time. I was left feeling very emotional during the entire book and cheering on the main character Ever. Also you find yourself falling in love with Toby and Frankie. Mostly Frankie for me because of his rockabilly style. All in all Ever left me feeling like the next book can't be released soon enough. Ever is worth the cash and you should pick it up if you like young adult paranormal romance novels.

Her novel, Ever started off a bit slow, but before I knew what was happening I was being sucked into a world of ghosts and mysterious strangers and if you know me you know how I love mysterious strangers. I have read a lot of paranormal books in my time and I was pleasantly surprised to find that this particular one was a lot more original than I originally expected it to be. The love of Ever's life, Frankie, was killed, but his soul hasn't moved on and so he haunts her for lack of a better word. But the cool thing is she isn't the only one who sees him. Her parents and best friend do too,though I'm not exactly sure how that works. Ever's best friend Jessie, the resident girly girl, boy lover, and party gooer is awesome. she totally reminds my of my best friend. Jessie's boyfriend Greg is also pretty cool. I like how he just sort of integrates himself into the group. I adore his relationship with Bessie even though we wont see much of it. But I digress. This is one of those girl loves boy, girls meets mystery boy and then loves him too kind of stories, but its the little details that set it apart from all the others. Ever is probably one of the most sheltered 17 year old's that I have seen in a story, but that's actually what I like about her. Not every teenager is out there boozing it up and having sex, so it's a nice change to see a main character that isn't the female version of Don Juan. I pretty much enjoyed all of Russo's characters, even the bad ones. I cant tell you how many times I wanted to slap Ariadene. She is wickedly evil and her obsession with Toby is bordering on psycho, but it's highly entertaining too. Ever's parents are a nice dose of normal added into the story too. If you notice a lot of young adult novels start with the main characters parents being dead, but Ever is one of the few that doesn't do that. She has parents who worry, set boundaries, and are there to comfort her when she needs them. I won't spoil what happens on that front, but this gif pretty much sums up my feelings on the matter. \nNow moving on to my favorite part of the story aside from the actual plot, Toby. Insert dreamy sigh here. I love Toby! I want to have his Soul Collector babies!...Did I not mention he's a Soul Collector? Well he is and that's another thing I really liked about this story. A new supernatural being, sort of like a modern day Grim Reaper, but alive. The fierce way in which Toby loves Ever is seriously addicting. I'm sorry, but while I like Frankie I am totally Team Toby FTW (for the win). I think he and ever had a real connection and the one thing I wasn't crazy about in this book was Ever jumping to being in bed with Toby one night and Frankie in the other. That struck me as odd especially because of how Ever is depicted in the beginning of the story. You're probably asking yourself how can Ever be in bed with Frankie if he's dead, good question. You're going to have to read the book to find out and that scene is particularly amusing. By the end of the book I was openly yelling at Ever for making bad choices or rather one bad choice. But the fact that I was annoyed was proof of how invested I was in this book. The characters were all well written and relatable. No one was perfect and things seemed pretty realistic...well except for the ghost part, but that's sort of the point! Anyhow the book left off on this huge cliffhanger and I was like what? No! I'm hoping Russo is planning a trilogy of some kind because I need more. I would definitely recommend this to readers who enjoy paranormal romance. And I'm totally making a Team Toby banner!....Okay fine I'll probably have Andi make a Team Toby banner, but that's just semantics."}, {"userName": "Ellen ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6504086-ellen", "userReview": "Seventeen year old Ever Van Ruysdael leads a somewhat different type of life than most teenagers. You see, two years ago, she was in a car crash with her best friend, the boy next door, the one she had a crush on forever, Frankie. Frankie died in that accident, and Ever has never been the same since. There is one catch, he doesn't move on. He's a ghost and he lives in Ever's house, and has since the accident. Not only can she see him, so can her family and her friends. It doesn't help that she still loves him and has never been able to move on, yet knows that she can never touch him, never have a real relationship. Still, she plays the game, they play the game, not openly declaring their feelings, secretly in love with each other, never really saying it out loud. Ever craves the physical touch of another, and she knows she never have that with Frankie, yet she can't seem to move on. That all changes when she sees the new neighbor, the one that is moving into Frankie's old house, who is one of the hottest guys she has ever seen, Toby. Ever and Toby end up going out, though she feels guilty, yet she is so attracted to him. Things begin to get intense between them. Frankie isn't too happy and begs her not to see him, but yet he won't give a reason. Ever has nightmares, nightmares that involve Frankie, and they get worse, especially after she experiences another tragedy. Frankie ends up showing up in her room every night to comfort her after the nightmares, and their true feelings for one another begin to surface. Still, she knows she can't be with him, not for real. Meanwhile, Toby's ex-girlfriend shows up on the scene, Her best friend Jesse has a new guy in her life, and things begin to get really complicated. She finds out Toby has secrets, big secrets, his ex-girlfriend has secrets, and her nightmares becomes more clear, and very, very fearful. Then on Ever's 18th birthday, she get the biggest surprise of her life, a surprise that will change things forever.Overall, I enjoyed this book. Though not unique, the plot and premise for the book were interesting. I liked Ever's character, though I wasn't overly impressed with her. I really enjoyed Frankie's character and would have liked to have heard more from his point of view and know what was going on in his head, and hope to see more of that in the sequel. Toby was just plain hot, he is the classic bad boy in the story, the one with a mysterious secret, the kind you just can't keep your hands off of. My favorite character was Jesse, Ever's best friend. She was funny, outspoken, and just had a great personality, adding a lot of humor to the book. As far as the romance, you have the classic love triangle going on. Ever can't make up her mind who she wants, wanting both Toby and Frankie, and they both want her, and there are several hot romantic scenes. There is a twist at the end of the book, one which you had a feeling might be coming, but it is presented in such a way that it leaves you hanging and ready for the next book.

On finding out its actually her nickname and an abbreviation of her initials I thought it was even more clever. Strangely enough, Ever suits our heroine of the tale. Ever is in love with her best friend Frankie (I know what you are thinking... Oh God, unrequited love - but read on), but there's one issue... Frankie is dead! In fact Frankie died when in an accident with Ever and she survived, somehow Frankie followed Ever home and has been her house guest and ghost ever since. Could you live without someone you love and need, day in day out without being able to touch them, kiss them.... So, as you can image Ever has it hard.With an opening like that I knew good things were to follow, I wasn't wrong. Step forth Toby... Oh Toby (Sorry lusting, swoon moment) the new boy who's moving in next door... Into Frankie's old house no less. With an instant attraction to Toby, but conflicted love towards Frankie we have a complicated love triangle.I'm not going to go any further, I want you to read the surprises not have me tell you them. But let me tell you, this isn't just your run of the mill love triangle. There's so much more to it, but I don't want to spoil it!The story has a wonderful flow to it, it moves gracefully almost like you are watching a tv show. I was intrigued from get go and admit I struggled putting this book down.Like many books you will pick your own favourite guy - I'm Team Toby! (I can't help it, its a tattoo thing!). Frankie is a great guy but Toby's dark, mysterious ways and cocky smile won me over!This book will appeal to many readers, its a Young Adult paranormal romance novel which will leave you wanting more! With 3 books in this series I can't wait to see what happens to Ever and the boys! I also feel many ages can enjoy this book, I'm 36 and found it to be a beautiful read, I'm sure anyone from teens up will feel the same.Suitable for mid teens upwards, this book does contain some sexual references but they are dealt with in a respectable manor.I could only give this book 5 stars, it is after all a great read and one of my favourites for 2012!Review also featured on my blog - http://www.bewitchedbooks.co.uk/"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5616772-jen", "userReview": "Thank you Netgalley and Curiosity Quills Press for this ARC. Frustrated. This is the best way I can describe how this book made me feel. I think the cover is pretty, the summary intriguing and while there were parts that I found interesting, the overall impression it's left me with is frustration. The biggest dislike for me was discovering 3/4 of the way through that it's not a stand alone. It ends with too many unanswered questions and a love triangle that was awkward. There didn't seem to be enough background story about Ever and Frankie other than they'd grown up together and she's always loved him. How he came to be a ghost, or rather, why he remains a ghost is glossed over and that left me with a ton of questions. Has their relationship always been one-sided? Where did his nickname for her come from? Where does he goes when he vanishes? Why is he so intent on her staying away from Toby? I had really hard time connecting with them as a potential couple.Then there's Toby. I didn't trust him at first and found his behavior very forward but as the story progressed, I actually liked him the best which isn't saying a lot because we're given very little information about him or the others. This is a pretty crucial part of the book to leave out, I think. It seemed like the focus was more on the wanna be love triangle which wouldn't have been bad if there were more details about the characters themselves. I couldn't find any information on a forthcoming book but I cant imagine there wouldn't be one with the way this one ended. However, a lot of blanks will need to be filled in for the next one to hold my interest.Spoilers* (I've tried to be as vague as possible but if you haven't read the book, I don't suggest reading any further.)We're told that Toby and the others are soul collectors but that's it. No other details are given. I equate this to Edward telling Bella he's a vampire and leaving it at that. (\"Bella, I'm a vampire. End of story.\") How can you reveal what Toby is but not explain how he came to be, what his duties are or what it means for Ever in the long run?We never find out who Toby's \"Dad\" really is and why Ariadne seems to be able to read minds, or at least she acts as if she can.It bothered me how quickly both Jess and Ever fell in love with Greg and Toby. Was is because the guys are able to influence the girls or the other way around? Does the fact that both girls can see Frankie mean they have hidden powers that have yet to be revealed? (Not everyone can see him.)How long can Frankie's new appearance really last before he's discovered? Before he gets tired of being couped up in Ever's house again?"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1433080-jessica", "userReview": "First off, I was immediately intrigued by the premise of this novel. It's about a teenage girl, Ever, who is living with the ghost of her best friend, Frankie. She tries to get over the romantic feelings she has for him and begins a steamy relationship with her neighbor, Toby. Based on that synopsis, I thought this book was going to be so different than it was. I went from thinking I was going to dislike it to not being able to put it down. It really exceeded my expectations.Here's what turned me off at first...* YA cliches. SO many. But that's not the author's fault really. YA is chock full of cliche's these days, and they are just getting tired and worn out. Mysterious hot neighbor. Having feelings for male best friend totally naive to the idea that he has feelings back. Girly, boy-crazy best friend. Clumsy brunette main character. The list goes on.* The story started sort of abruptly. I felt like the storytelling lacked a little creativity when introducing characters. (It got better throughout the novel)* Some of the characters, like the Mom and best friend, were slightly obnoxious for my taste.With all of that, I kept reading. Even with those things bugging me at first, the author does a great job of keeping you confused, but in a good way. I kept wanting more of characters like Frankie and Toby. I still had no clue what was going to happen even as I was finishing it and I love that. Here's what I loved about this book...* The romantic tension was some of the best I've read in all of YA. Dare I say, this was the hottest YA book I've read. You may think that's a good thing or a bad thing. In it's defense, it was equally as sweet, and I really enjoyed the tender moments between Ever and Toby and/or Frankie.* The paranormal aspect was a surprise. I knew before reading it that there was a ghost, but that doesn't always mean it will be a paranormal novel. I just expected a romance, but it had that mystery and excitement that only a paranormal romance can offer.* The cliffhanger ending! nuff said.You will like this book if you like...* Obviously paranormal romance, but even if you don't like YA, you will still probably like this book. All in all, it was an enjoyable read. I finished it in a weekend and annoyed my husband with constantly having my Kindle glued to my face. I cannot wait for the next installment!See more reviews on my blog: http://sweet-green-tangerine.blogspot..."}, {"userName": "Misery", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10541528-misery", "userReview": "I won this book through Goodreads free giveaway and what a lucky win it was! I would have gladly purchased this book. Ever was such a pleasant surprise for me. In my opinion, paranormal romance has really been attempted every which way possible in recent years, however this story, put this genre back on the map. The material was original and refreshing. It contained so many twists and unexpected turns that I could hardly put it down. The detail to which the author delves into with the characters was exceptional. I felt as though they were people I would have been friends with in high school. The protagonist was flakey, indecisive, unsure of herself, moody and cried often. Some reviewers didn't appreciate her for these, as well as various other flaws but those flaws were true to life. That is how seventeen year old girls behave. The love triangle between Frankie, Ever and Toby was very well balanced, making her indecisiveness understandable and leaving me to take sides and then change my mind several times about who she should choose. The idea of their being \"soul collectors\" is fantastic in my opinion. There are so many different ways that aspect of the story can go. The villian in the story was the type of character we all love to hate. Well done there. The ending was one of the biggest cliffhangers I've read in a long time! I cannot wait for book two!!! Overall, I loved this book. I would have easily given it five stars had it not been for the following...1. Ever. Hated the name, but whatever.2. I could have done with a little less \"Doll\" and \"Dollface\" as well as being reminded of how much Jess loves pink.3. Numerous topics were just touched upon such as, Ever's sister dying, Frankie's death and how it came to be that his ghost was stuck in Ever's house and their were very few details on the soul collectors.4. I'm not sure if the soul collectors had anything to do with Ever's fathers death. That was never discussed but Toby seemed to have inside info.5. Ted. What the hell was his problem?! I didn't care for his character at all.6. After the soul collectors were found out, Greg just faded away out of the story. I found that slightly odd. 7. How did Ari bring back Frankie from the dead???Having said that, these are minor details and all have the potential to be answered in book two. Let's hope so!"}], "description": "Seventeen-year-old Ever\u2019s love life has been on hold for the past two years.
