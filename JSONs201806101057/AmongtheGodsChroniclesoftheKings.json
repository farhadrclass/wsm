This truly was a lesson on the forgiveness and love of a Heavenly Father. I'm a visual person and the picture was clearly demonstrated that no matter the depth of our sins God's strong arm of love is long enough to reach us. His desire is not to destroy but to heal. Another thing I noticed that in each book of this series the author took care in really completing the story leaving you satisfied at the end. So many times I will read a book and it just seems like the author was so done writing and the last chapter is just a \"hurry up and get this over with\" chapter. Not so with these books, especially the last. Each sentence right up to the end seemed like it had purpose. I felt satisfied - even though I definitely would like to see the story continue on to Josiah.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the whole series. I would recommend reading the whole series though. You could probably get away with reading them each on their own, but you really shouldn't. Each feeds off of the other books before it as the characters develop."}, {"userName": "Jeanie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5130755-jeanie", "userReview": "If you want to learn more about the Old Testament, you will enjoy reading these books. You also experience the not so difference of our hearts with her characters. How hard it is to forgive, to see God's forgiveness and His grace and mercy. This is a continuation of the Kings of the Old Testament. King Manneseh was the King of Israel's history. Unlike his father, his pride lead him to wickedness and lead his people there as well. Joshua recovering from the death of his father and the prophet Isaiah, escaped with his family and a group of Levites to Egypt. I felt like I had a better undestanding of what happened and why. The why is important because it can easily be our why as to our separation from the Lord. You see how Joshua struggled with anger and the anger his adopted son Nathan is not much different than him. Sometimes the Lord gives us people to show the struggle of our heart. This is an opportuntity of a heart cry from our hearts to the Lord to become more like him. We serve the Lord as we become more like His nature. We serve ourselves when we serve our flesh, the struggle is knowing the difference. A great story to show the difference of the nature of God and our flesh!"}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11019000-steven", "userReview": "Joshua Ben Eliakim fled King Mannaseh\u2019s ruthless reign of terror with a faithful remnant to a new home in Egypt.

The author addresses plenty of tough questions that people learning about God face. I appreciated everything she used to make her point that God is a forgiving, loving, and second chance God. He never abandons us even when we abandon him to the darkest of sins. This last book was hard to read at the beginning. The anger and bitterness that major characters expressed was discouraging to read. Once I got more into the plot, I was totally invested. I was completely content with the ending of the series. I actually wish there were more books to continue the Bible stories. My favorite book of the series is The Strength of His Hand. The storyline and Christian teaching in this book related to me the most.

Wonderful.I will add a little side note...I almost stopped reading this one, which shocked me! I have been loving this series. But this one started out so heavy, I just wasn't wanting to read it.

I loved learning about King Hezekiah's devotion to God in the first three, and it was also very interesting to read about his son's wicked idolatry and how he eventually turned back to seek God. I love how these people's lives are very few verses in the Bible, but through studying other passages, Isaiah's prophecies, and historical data, Austin lengthens the story of these kings."}, {"userName": "Carleene Hibbs reeder", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21738261-carleene-hibbs-reeder", "userReview": "So good!

The first part was action packed. Very good introduction and at least to this point, action packed. It does not take much to turn someone against you, as Joshua is learning so far. He called his plan \"God's plan\", and forced his sister to marry the prince that was with him - when she loved another and that other loved her back. That other then betrayed them to King Manasseh.The second part seemed to take place over many years. Now Joshua has married Miriam, but throughout the next several years has problems being a father to Nathan (Miriam's half-brother that he vowed to raise as his son). While there are still glimpses of Judah and King M'nasheh, they are not featured as heavily as the character development. Assyria invaded Egypt, and the fighting men were called out. Nathan wanted to fight, but after the battle Nathan realized how much Joshua wanted to be his \"actual\" father and how Joshua had treated him as his son - and they became family. Nathan had refused to accept Joshua as his father up until that point. The third part has to do with Manasseh - he was accused by Assyria of plotting to rebel so he was taken and thrown into an Assyrian prison (nothing like our prisons today). While in the prison, Manasseh remembered all he had done, turned back to Adonai the God of Israel and eventually was returned to Israel as an Assyrian vassal. The drama comes in when Joshua, Manasseh's younger brother, and Joel, the high priest have returned to Jerusalem in Manasseh's absence and helped govern while Manasseh was in prison. Manasseh was willing to have his brother help him reign, to have Joshua help him reign, and for Joel the high priest to restore the Temple. The problem was that Joshua still had not forgiven him for everything that Manasseh had done prior - even though God had. While the series was alright, it did have some issues, and this book did not escape from them. The author is very good at writing a series AFTER Jesus came; but not so good at limiting herself from hints about what will happen in the future, even if the storyline is hundreds of years before Jesus. This is a very good end to the series. It ties up all loose ends and allows people to go read the Bible to find out what happens generically - because, other than King Manasseh and what happened to him, it's doubtful that the other characters were real."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5385307-becky", "userReview": "I loved the first three books in this series. I am giving the final two books a 3-star rating because I feel the story really lost steam. Both books will share this review because I felt exactly the same about both of them. The change in characters left me with no previous attachments. Because of that, by the 5th book, I didn\u2019t even care what happened to the annoying characters. Several of them I wanted to slap, and others I wanted to get lost in the wilderness.I enjoyed portions of the story but hated others. Honestly, there were moments I was moved to tears. There was excitement, bravery, and moments I couldn\u2019t put the book down. However, I really hated reading about King Manasseh\u2019s wickedness. A few times I wanted to throw the books out a window. I hated how easy King Manasseh got off. I wanted more from his suffering. I wanted true sorrow. I wanted to reach into the depths of his soul. I wanted his change to be something so tangible that I could feel. If the author had given me that, I might have loved these as much the first. Additionally, I wanted more at the end. The ending did nothing to satisfy me. It was a \u201cyou have got to be kidding moment!\u201dZerah was a character to truly hate. However, I didn\u2019t need to read that he was cross-eyed a half dozen times. I hate redundancy.

Austin has an amazing way of bringing ancient history to life, as well as aligning it with the Scripture accounts. This is action, interesting characters, and helps me visualize the life and times milennia ago. It helped me put the epochs together--Isaiah lived at the time of Manasseh, etc. It depicted the setting of Jerusalem and Egypt so clearly, I felt like I had traveled there. The Scriptures and biblical concepts were uplifting and encouraging even after I finished the book. Thank you, Christina--loved the book, and it was perfect for this time in my life! Just one caveat: at one point, one of the main characters is asked by a friend,\"Can you forgive God for allowing that to happen?\". God has never done anything wrong so has no need to be forgiven!

For me, the character renditions of Book 5 were not as compelling as the plot driven books. Part of this may have to do with the fact that the main character, a troubled man, reminded me of someone I knew - it wasn't a favorable reminder. However, the themes of pushing our will on God and finding out we have made a significant error, the rebelliousness of a son, overcoming suffering, conquering hatred and bitterness, making sense of suffering, accepting the weaknesses of others, living love/ compassion for difficult people, and reconciliation with God and among men are strong.

This is no exception. The series really shows how trusting God was important to the Hebrews and how He came through - every time.In this last book, Joshua's hatred of King Massaneh, how he allows that hatred to burn in his heart and by extension, everyone he touches, is really evident.Personally, it showed me how letting go of bad feelings toward someone is so incredibly FREEING, like lifting a weight off your shoulders.
