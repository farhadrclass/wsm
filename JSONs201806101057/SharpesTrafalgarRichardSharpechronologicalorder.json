I can't blame him, it's one of the biggest events of the Napoleonic War, and if that's the backdrop to your series it stands to reason you'd want to showcase this particular battle in some way. Contrived as it may be, Sharpe's Trafalgar is one of Cornwell's better efforts writing-wise. Perhaps because he was on unfamiliar ground (or water, I guess), he was probably taking extra care in crafting this book, whereas some volumes in his Sharpe series tend to seem rushed, recycled or carelessly rendered. That's not to say they're not enjoyable action-adventure pieces, but you can tell when Cornwell is really feeling it and when he's going through the motions. However, while Sharpe's Trafalgar is well-put-together, it is not as much fun a read as others in the series. You see, Sharpe is a soldier, not a sailor. He's out of his element and thrown into a historical setting which is well-known to many (In London there's a wide square and huge monument erected in memorial of the battle and its hero), leaving little wiggle room to change that landscape. Thus Sharpe, the usually active man of action, is more of a sideline watcher and that's not what readers have come to expect."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57725883-rob", "userReview": "Number 4 in the Sharpe series.As the title implies, this historical fiction is about The Battle of Trafalgar.As luck would have it, Richard Sharpe is on board ship sailing for England, where he has been assigned to the 95th rifles.It's along way from Bombay to London and a lot could and will happen in between departure and destination.Illicit love with a married lady of the gentry. Theft on a grand scale. Turn coat English captains. Last but not least, The Battle of Trafalgar, and Richard Sharpe is in the thick of it all. The brutality of war at sea is here in all it's awful glory.Along the way we'll meet some memorable characters. Some to hate, some to love and some to inspire.

Sharpe has to take a ship back to England & Cromwell paints a logical picture of why Sharpe, an army soldier, would wind up in this battle. He admits he had no real business there, but it works well & gave me a visceral picture of life on board the ships of the time as well as covering this pivotal battle of the era.Life on a ship of this time was rough. Sharpe, as an ensign, is in the perfect position to show us all aspects & there is quite a difference between what a crewman or steerage passenger can expect compared to the officers & rich passengers. The way fighting was handled was also covered completely. Horrifying is probably the only word that really covers the whole experience. Since Carnival Cruises have been much in the news, the comparison is obvious & provides a laughable counterpoint. Our expectations have come a long way in 2 centuries."}, {"userName": "Nate", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6803829-nate", "userReview": "I think Aqua-Sharpe! would have been a cooler title, but this was still good fun. This is an obvious departure for the series, and one I was kinda skeptical about but Cornwell just knows how to spin a well-paced story. I really have little to no interest in naval stuff but I kept turning the pages so it's all a credit to his ease with storytelling. I mean, the plot alone sounds really terribly boring: it's basically about Sharpe's boat ride to England during which he becomes involved in Trafalgar, but Cornwell's little plots about Sharpe's greasy affair with a nobleman's wife and the dark stuff that happens as a result, documents with grave political potential trading hands, an extended chase across the ocean, etc. kept it nice and lively for me. Despite all the fun, it certainly feels inconsequential and already kind of a minor entry in the series.This novel also boasts a particularly anti-heroic Sharpe, which was nice. There were a couple moments where he almost went to the point of villainy which do show some unseen depth to Sharpe's psyche never previously seen. In previous entries like Triumph the reader gets glimpses of what a psycho Sharpe can be but in this book he's positively fucking cold-blooded. Again, more lighthearted and fun stuff, particularly for \"summer reading\". Honestly, I never get it when I see that saying. Do people tend to read more grim and challenging stuff in the winter? I really am not trying my hand at observational humor, I just never found out what that means.This book's big climactic battle is the titular Trafalgar, a particularly brutal naval engagement between English ships on one side and French and Spanish ships on the other. Cornwell does really get across how titanic naval battles of the era were, with these huge and bulky aquatic fortresses just utterly raking each other with huge and numerous guns. I think he mentions that one of the ships is carrying more artillery than the entire British side at Assaye, which Sharpe personally takes part in in Sharpe's Triumph. The admiral commanding the British side was the famous Nelson and Sharpe does get to have dinner with him or something. I don't know, compared to what strong characterization Cornwell gives other historical figures like Alfred the Great or even Arthur Wellesley I basically remember Nelson from this novel as a short one-armed guy. I have no idea what his value was as a leader, which is kind of a rare failing for Cornwell. In total, another thoroughly entertaining if minor Sharpe."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2429588-susan", "userReview": "OK, I give up.

Not quite as polished as the works of Patrick O'Brian, Bernard Cornwell's naval Sharpe adventure still managed to be exciting, suspenseful and fun.

Start on chapter ten, right where Sharpe is waiting for the battle to start. Read right though to the end of the book, because it's non stop brutally graphic combat action at sea. Except for some incredibly tense scenes between Lord William and Lady Grace. When you reach the end of the book, go back and skim through the first few chapters just to find out how sharp got mixed up with Lady Grace and what happened to Braithwaite. This is definitely a great book, but the last fifty pages are five stars and the first one hundred are three stars, hence a four star rating."}, {"userName": "Kate Sherrod", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1854297-kate-sherrod", "userReview": "OK, I'll admit, I've been putting off reading this one just because the very idea of it seemed ludicrous and forced to me. As has been very firmly established, our man Richard Sharpe is a daring, lucky and resourceful infantry officer. Infantry. The guy can barely ride a horse, but he's the devil in a red coat on foot. But see, Trafalgar was a naval battle. As in between ships. Admiral Nelson. Sailing maneuvers (or lack thereof: just go right at 'em). Ramming. Boarding parties. Being on the water.So how could Sharpe have a Trafalgar that wasn't preposterous and contrived?Answer: well, he can't: but the contriving minimizes the preposterousness and soon the reader forgets her pre-book scoffing altogether. After all, Richard does have to get from India back to England somehow, and we readers have already swallowed his just happening to be the unknown man who killed the Tippoo Sultan and the man who \"really\" found the way into Gawilgur.Anyway, lesson well learned: always trust Uncle Bernard.Speaking of things we learn, Sharpe's Trafalgar is also where we learn, not only that Sharpe has sea legs, but that he doesn't require the heat of battle to be a killer. Oh, we've had hints of this before, witness his attempt in the first book to feed his Wile E. Coyote nemesis to a tiger, but what we see in his shipboard relationship with his would-be blackmailer*, Mister Braithwaite, shows new depths of cold-bloodedness. Sharpe has never known an even-handed, just application of society's rules and laws, so he doesn't feel particularly bound by them. Dude.And Sharpe has a lot to learn as well, here, for he has in the person of his friend Captain Chase (whom he rescued from a nasty crew on land in the novel's prologue) an example of leadership like he's not seen before. His Pucelle**, on which Sharpe finds himself after he's sort-of-rescued from a captured Indiaman, is a great big ship of the line, a floating artillery battery, and, that rarity of rarities, a happy ship. How does he do that?\"Sharpe watched Chase, for he reckoned he had still a lot to learn about the subtle business of leading men. He saw that the captain did not secure his authority by recourse to punishment, but rather by expecting high standards and rewarding them. He also hid his doubts.\"From what I know about Sharpe's future with a rifle company in the Napoleonic wars (these novels have such cultural currency that it's almost as impossible not to know Sharpe's going to end up a lieutenant in Spain as it is not to know what Rosebud is), these are good lessons for him to be getting, very important for his transformation from a gutter rat whose first (chronological) scene in fiction is of him getting flogged to a man who inspires loyalty.The scenes with Sharpe and Chase are also a nice antidote to the soap opera adultery plot that comprises more than half this book.*** Ugh.But the real star here is the famous naval battle, into which the Pucelle more or less stumbles. Cornwell gives Patrick O'Brian a run for his ramming, gunning, sailing money here; one could fully imagine the Surprise being somewhere in the smoke (but of course we know it wasn't. Sillies. The Surprise was as real as... as the Pucelle!). The action is described in loving detail, with an emphasis on its chaotic nature, for we are seeing it from the perspective of an infantry soldier serving as an \"honorary marine\" who barely understands what's going on.And yes, Cornwell succumbs to the temptation to substitute his fictional ship for the real one that rescued Admiral Nelson's flagship just as the French were about to board her, and also to the temptation to make Sharpe the person Nelson finds most interesting at his pre-battle breakfast. But I ask you: who wouldn't? Scenes such as those are a big part of why historical fiction is fun, if one isn't simply writing a fictionalized biography of an actual historical figure the way, say, Jean Plaidy does. But yes, I rolled my eyes a bit. But I was also smiling. It's a Sharpe book, after all.It's just not the best Sharpe book. Hey, they can't all be.Onward to Europe!*Of course the blackmail is over a woman. Cornwell knows and respects the principle of Chekhov's Gun; if a pretty woman shows up in the first act of a Sharpe novel, Sharpe is going to become her lover, even if, as in this case, she is married to an obnoxious nobleman.**\"Pucelle\" in English is \"virgin.\" Ho ho!**The other half, at least until the Pucelle stumbles across the battle at Trafalgar, is a chase plot. While Sharpe is schtupping the nobleman's wife in every unseen corner of the ship that isn't too disgusting, the ship is chasing a French one, the Revenant, to which Sharpe's frenemy and also a suspected spy jumped after it took the first ship that Sharpe and co embarked on, the Calliope. It's all very exciting and Patrick O'Brian-ish, and I would have much preferred it without all the tedious adultery, but I'm just sort of like that, you know?"}, {"userName": "Kathy Davie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4222001-kathy-davie", "userReview": "Fourth in the Richard Sharpe historical military fiction series, set in 1805 amidst the Battle of Trafalgar.My TakeI do so love Richard Sharpe! Okay, okay, so I fell in love with Sean Bean in the television series first, but it only turned me on to Cornwell's series! I swear! The series is an incredible exploration of early 19th century English culture with its mores, style, and class system particularly an inside peek into its military culture. And as much as I enjoy the television series, I adore the books much more.Seeing the military and the battles through the eyes of Richard Sharpe brings history to life, and Cornwell does an incredible job of bringing the fear, terror, and agony of battle deep into the reader's psyche.It's not just a recitation of battles but an in-depth view of life and war and how it affects one man. His dreams, his desires to rise up from his beginnings. His brutality balanced by his passion to succeed and his care for those less able to care for themselves\u2014no matter their class.Part of the attraction is Cornwell including secondary characters who recognize Sharpe's abilities and ignore his station. I always love it when the underdog wins! Captain Hunt provides Sharpe with an excellent role model in how to lead men.I can hardly wait to dive into \nSharpe's Prey\n, 5!The StoryWith his transfer to the 95th Rifles in place, Sharpe must get himself home to England in the course of which he experiences a wide variety of social and military adventures\u2026with a new love in tow.Life continues to amuse when one of Sharpe's fellow passengers is actually a deserter and enemy whom Sharpe allows his imposture. In gratitude, and I suspect humor, this enemy takes every opportunity to invite the rough-edged Sharpe to dine at the captain's table.But then, suddenly, the Calliope is captured by the French, and it's up to Mr. Sharpe to take her back.The CharactersEnsign Richard Sharpe was an orphan who escaped hanging by enlisting in the Army where he was promptly posted off to India, and now, six years later, he's returning to England at the invitation of the 95th Rifles, a new company being formed.HMS Pucelle is\u2026\u2026a third rate ship of French design with Captain Joel Hunt as its engaging, impetuous young captain, grateful for Sharpe's aid with Nana Rao's attempted fraud.The voyage from India aboard Calliope \u2026\u2026which is captained by Peculier Cromwell and the significant members of the ship's crew who include: Clouter, a runaway slave from St. Helena; Second Lieutenant Peel with the beautiful voice; Midshipman Harry Collier; Cowper, the ship's purser; Captain Llewellyn who is in charge of the ship's Marines; Sgt.

In contrast, Cornwall (and he much as says so in his notes) conceives his novel as a \u201cvehicle\u201d transporting Sharpe from his Indian military past to his future in the British army fighting in Europe. And as long as Sharpe\u2019s on a ship around the time of Trafalgar, can we make it a British ship of the line\u2026? Can we then involve it in a tantalizing chase of a French ship of the line which carries a British traitor who has stolen the jewels Sharpe took from the body of the rajah he slew\u2026? And can we then have this ship of the line end up near Gibraltar at exactly the right time...? Cornwall shamelessly succumbs to temptation and has his stalwart hero help save that famous day at sea\u2014though the greater part of the first of the novel is devoted to assorted sub plots involving various villains, including a Frenchman disguised as a lackey carrying an all-important dispatch. And of course there is the latest iteration of The Woman per Volume, in this case an icy British beauty unhappy in her marriage to a cad (Will she melt to the scarred charms of you-know-who?). In sum, Reverte is better history, while Cornwall is here up to more than his usual \u2026 well \u2026 corn \u2026 in a novel that is a congeries (the Indian origin of the word wonderfully apt) of coincidences.Concerning the interpretation of this battle from the point of view of victor and defeated, it is interesting that Reverte places much blame on the French commander of the Spanish/French fleet, Villeneuve, while Cornwall stresses Nelson\u2019s tactics and the superiority of British gunners. Both commend their respective navies for extraordinary valor in the face of carnage. Of the four Sharpe\u2019s so far, this seems to me the weakest \u2026 and yet still a great read.

This one takes place fourth sequentially, but is the most recent of seventeen to be published. Cornwell is prolific and a master storyteller. The story opens with Sharpe in India, having been there several years but now about to return to England having joined up with the 95th Rifles. He' an ensign, a low ranking officer promoted out of the ranks. Being wise to the ways of crooks, he helps out an English naval officer who had been cheated out of several hundred pounds. Apparently it was the practice of travelers to bring their own furniture when traveling by ship and there existed a thriving business reselling furniture of those who had recently arrived from England and no longer needed the equipment they had used on the voyage. The ploy was to sell the furniture, promising delivery to the ship before it left, then have the warehouse burn down and the owner ostensibly killed. In reality, he escaped, as did all the items in the warehouse, and the goods were then sold again by a cousin, both of the culprits making a tidy profit. As the first seller was supposed to be dead, there was no legal recourse. Sharpe sniffed out the plot and helped himself and the naval officer to recoup their money. Befriending Captain Chase, the naval officer, Sharpe finds himself on Chase's ship the Pucelle, a seventy-four, and in a chase after the Revenant a French warship carrying a spy back to France with some important information related to the India campaign. Rake that he is, Sharpe soon is heavily involved with Lady Grace, wife of the haughty Lord Williams, sleeping with her ostensibly behind everyone's back. Lord Williams' secretary Braithwaite becomes aware of their involvement and Sharpe kills him, making it look as if Braithwaite had falling down a ladder. Sharpe would like to kill Williams, too, but apparently his conscience prohibits killing those higher on the social ladder. Grace is soon pregnant, but before an immediate resolution, the Pucelle and the Revenant, find themselves in the midst of the British and French fleets at Trafalgar. Cornwell is a master storyteller."}, {"userName": "Ensiform", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform", "userReview": "On his way home to England, Sharpe sails with one Captain Peculiar Cromwell, and meets up with his old cordial enemy, Pohlmann.

As always, the historical details of ships, battles, dress and speech are mostly meticulously rendered, mixed in with a perhaps more modern action-hero sensibility (perhaps some of Sharpe\u2019s actions, as a mere ensign, might have been frowned upon in reality).

Perhaps it was due to the different battle location (at sea instead of one land) even though I found Uhtred\u2019s sea adventures exciting.I could not accept the villianization of hapless secretary, poorly treated by his boss, Lord Hale (who doesn\u2019t even mourn his death). I actually identified with the secretary, born into a poor family, who tried to lift himself up through education. Early on, in ch 2, he tries to befriend Sharpe, is pleasant to him, and does him a big favour. Later on, in ch 7, he asked Sharpe why the aristocrats should be allowed their privilege & lifestyle. Ch 7: \u201cPeople like Hale are born to fortunes. They abuse us, grind us down. They think we\u2019re dirt. By what justification can mere birth birth bestow such good fortune on one man and deny it to another? Are we lesser men because their ancestors were brutes in plate armour who stole a fortune?\u201dSharpe\u2019s unlikely affair with the Lady Grace, daughter of an Earl, took me out the story. It stretched credulity that she would risk her position in society to have an affair with someone so far beneath her. I thought she was using him, knowing that her soldier lover would defend her in battle. After hearing that he saved the life of her cousin, Wellington, it is not a coincidence that she chooses him as a lover when she finds herself in danger. In fact, he killed every man who threatened her life & future happiness. Bored in her loveless marriage, she pesters Sharpe with hints & suggestions on how her husband could die on board. In ch 8, she encourages Sharpe to kill her husband, promising him a life together. That would NEVER happen. When she manipulates Sharpe into giving her a pistol, it is obvious who she will be killing with it, and who will cover up the murder. Due to all her scheming, I even doubted she was really pregnant; probably just told him that to make him fight harder to protect her. I had no sympathy for the beautiful, rich, pampered Lady Grace or her \u201cproblems\u201d. Her father, an earl, arranged her marriage to a very rich lord (as was the duty of aristo parents), her baby died (very common in that era), her husband paid prostitutes (not unusual at that time), her husband didn\u2019t mistreat her (which she admits), and they do not love each other (not unheard of in such matches). Compared to women born in poverty, she has nothing to complain about. If the author needed Sharpe to have a love interest, the Lady\u2019s maid would have been more believable. To make the story more absurd, the Captain condones the affair (despite vast difference in social classes) and a fellow sailor tells Sharpe \u201cYou should have killed him (the husband) weeks ago\u201d.

The graphic clarity of the author's description of the Battle of Trafalgar with all of its horror, gore and heroics is excellent - as one comes to expect in novels by Bernard Cornwell. This novel may be an anomaly, but it is by no means a disappointment - quite to the contrary.Sharpe, having been dismissed from his regiment in India is in Bombay waiting for passage of an East Indiaman ship for England. He befriends a British naval post captain when both are swindled by an Indian merchant and his brother. He finally boards the merchant ships and finds to his surprise that his old rival, Anthony Pohlman, who formerly served as commander of the Indian Rajahs' mercenary forces in their war against the British army and is now foisting himself off as a German baron. Sharpe also is introduced to Sir William Hale, a haughty British aristocrat and his beautiful young wife, Lady Grace Hale.

Obviously, it all culminates in Sharpe's ship (which is shipshape) sharing shots in the shattering Battle of Trafalgar, one of the most famous naval engagements of all time. Aficionados won't be surprised to learn that Sharpe plays a decisive and successful role in his ship's particular battle. The battle scenes are among the most graphic of the series, which is saying something, and Cornwell has again done his historical homework so on balance this is one of the better books of an excellent series."}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57993472-justin", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed Sharpe's Trafalgar, and foresee no diminishing my enjoyment of Sharpe's adventures through the Napoleonic Wars. Having finished Sharpe's Tiger, Triumph, Fortress, Trafalgar and Prey in a 5 month period, my recommendation when reading the Sharpe novels is to enjoy the first 2/3 at a leisurely pace as Sharpe receives the brunt of several injustices and hardships, but then plan to read the final 1/3 of any Sharpe novel at a brisk pace, consistent with the pace of a major battle which typically coincides with the conclusion of the story arc in each book. Now that I had finished the \"prequels\", I'm excited to move on to Rifles and see Sharpe meet up with his more well known companions, including Sergeant Harper."}, {"userName": "Patrick Young", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32073358-patrick-young", "userReview": "Maybe I just love Trafalgar, I ve read about every account of the battle and stood on the HMS Victory where Nelson was killed, so I had to give this a rare 5 stars.I also love the rather detailed account of life at sea. I spent a year or so at sea so again a lot of nostalgia. Other than that typical Sharpe book, he is always a lovable rogue, falls in love again (yawn) kills a few people who deserve it and a few who don't, ends up covered in blood after killing like a thousand frogs (frenchies), perhaps an exaggeration but you get the idea.As always it's the historical details I love about Cornwell books and the stuffy British Army that most tolerate Sharpe because Napolean is the disease that only men like Sharpe can cure."}, {"userName": "Alex Van Beek", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32312933-alex-van-beek", "userReview": "Of the four Sharpe books I've read so far, this one is my favorite. By now, I see there is definitely a formula to the Sharpe books: 19th century historical setting, Sharpe has a good friend and someone who totally hates him, has sex with a hot woman, and then Sharpe saves the day. But it's the details that make these books so great. Sharpe's Trafalgar makes the minutiae of living on a ship in 1805 interesting, and even though Sharpe is out of his element on the sea, he's surrounded by characters with depth and is embroiled in a plot that has weight."}, {"userName": "Mark Baines", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51458999-mark-baines", "userReview": "delivers what you expect from Bernard Cornwell. A good plot based on historic facts with a few key plausible main characters and enough 'extra's to keep the story moving without getting bogged down in detail. That Sint to say the prose isn't good - it is excellent. Cornwell departs from the land in this story, and displays his expertise in his craft with an excellent tale of the Battle of Trafalgar into which he weaves his characters with his customary style and verve. A solid read about the Chosen Man."}, {"userName": "Shivam Bahuguna", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18072438-shivam-bahuguna", "userReview": "This was my second Cornwell book after Agincourt.I really admire Cornwell's talent of combining minute historical details with taking fictional liberties to give a thoroughly entertaining read.This one took place mostly at sea among sailing ships, so it became necessary for me to look up the nautical terms to enjoy the novel better. But I wouldn't call it a drawback. If you are reading a Cornwell book, you have to expect these.Really enjoyed reading it. Eagerly looking forward to fine more books to read by Bernard Cornwell."}, {"userName": "Gio C", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68774453-gio-c", "userReview": "Another great one by Mr Cornwell. A great spin on the battle of Trafalgar. I wasn't sure how the book was going to go with Sharpe being an army man and this a sea battle but Mr. Cornwell ties everything in perfectly. The Historical notes at the end of the novel lets you know what was true and what was added. The drama that follows Sharpe is good. Not as compelling as other stories but kept my interest."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan", "userReview": "A weaker entry. It's mostly set on a ship and it's about a romance between Sharpe and Grace. Obviously, their love is forbidden. At the end, there's the Battle of Trafalgar, which was a pretty big deal. And that seems to be why the novel was written. Also, the cover of my book, which is mostly great, states that Sharpe travels on the Revenant. He does not -- the ship he is on pursues the Revenant."}, {"userName": "Daniel O'Brien", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30224996-daniel-o-brien", "userReview": "3\u00bd stars.Sharpe's better on land than on the sea. The action was much slower-paced in this one, though I felt it did a good job of presenting the helpless terror inherent in a naval action.Sharpe's still a bad-ass and that's still fun, though he treads a bit deep into Marty Stu territory in this one for my tastes. There also felt like a bit too much hand of god holding the plot together.Still keen for the next one."}], "description": "From New York Times bestselling author Bernard Cornwell, now available in paperback\u2014bestselling historical novelist Bernard Cornwell brings life to one of the most spectacular naval battles in history with SHARPE\u2019S TRAFALGAR.\"The greatest writer of historical adventures today.\" \u2014Washington PostCritically acclaimed, perennial New York Times bestselling author Bernard Cornwell (Agincourt, The Fort, the Saxon Tales) makes real history come alive in his breathtaking historical fiction.
