It doesn't matter what you write, how good your descriptions of the countryside are etc, if the people don't seem somehow authentic, then you're going to struggle to keep your audience.What I love about Mr Brooke's books is that while his characters are a shade different from the mainstream, they ARE authentic, they ARE modern, and reading about them helps open the mind about the different types of people we might come across in the world. Apart from that, having such interesting characters just makes the whole read more enjoyable!Harking back briefly to Zombie Candy, the character of Roberta was so realistically and painfully drawn, that I had great feeling for her. Fast forward to Collateral Damage and he's done it again - brought out in Annie and Michael that obsessiveness that comes with an unhealthy love. And as for drawing in the character of Todd - well, I would clearly have left HIM on the side of the road if he'd been in MY car! The story is also modern in that as a minor part of the storyline, it talks about coeliacs and gluten free foods. Having a close friend, different neighbours and meeting countless others over the last few years who suffer from this debilitating medical issue, it was great to see it being used as a story line and a way to easily (and surreptitiously!) educate people.Mr Brooke's research, or else his general knowledge, is astounding. I learnt bits about sink holes, weapons, Iraq, getting info off mobile phones and laptops - you name it. He either has a great imagination ... or great sources :)Like most stories which build, you will need stick with the early chapters. And it probably won't appeal greatly to men - it is not a boys' own adventure. But this is quality fiction, the third in a series, yet with a change of location, new characters, more depth into old ones, and subliminal learning along the way."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/658719-kate", "userReview": "I had never heard of this author before. Then I received a complementary copy of Collateral Damage. Now my only regret is that Brooke has only written 2 other books. This story completely sucked me in and held my attention. It reads like a roller coaster, the first 100 pages pulling you up and up, just waiting. Then, out of nowhere, you are flying through twists and turns and loops just trying to keep up. Damage was truly a joy to read, and I look forward to my next Annie Ogden mystery!"}, {"userName": "Nai", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7499865-nai", "userReview": "This is the third book I've read in the Annie Ogden series. I'd like to say I'm not really a serial person, but the truth is, if the series is good, I'll keep reading and reading and pestering for more.\n\n\nThis was good. So here goes:Frederick Lee Brooke, keep writing.Here's why.Not only did you bring me a few hours of enjoyment, you gave me a story that made me laugh (sadly at times) at the story that was spun, and the mystery and the love that follows around Annie, Salvatore and Michael.Reading a series is different than reading a stand alone book. You might say OBVIOUSLY, but I constantly see people griping about character development being slow, or not following the story and the necessity of reading each book in order. The truth is, none of that takes away from a good book.I thought about re-reading Max Vinyl and Zombie Candy before reading this book, but then decided to see what it would be like to just dive in. Turns out, Collateral Damage stands just as well on its own.I'm not saying don't read the other two books at all, just that it doesn't matter which one you start with. Each takes place chronologically, but you can enjoy Collateral Damage before Zombie Candy\u00a0of vice versa. Of the three books though, this one is my favorite so far. I'm now invested in the characters, and I'd like to get to know Salvatore more. I'd also like to see where he and Annie wind up, but I suppose that's anther tale...Sadly (or ironically and humorously if you're me) it read much like my past. Minus the army, because I sure didn't do that - but the love life escapades, the crazy ex's and crazy other people's ex's that I did.Minus the Meth. (But plus some other questionable substances.)[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"461\"] There's a reason this duck is F*&^%ng terrifying, and it isn't because it's doused in oil. (Sadly) From Wikicommons[/caption]I hold great admiration for anyone who can write a novel, and even greater admiration for someone who can pace a series properly, and keep the reader both satisfied and wanting more. Brooke manages to do all this in three books, and unlike many movies - makes me want to read/see the fourth.The characters are easy to identify with, complicated, and most importantly human. I do want to get to know them more, in fact, I want an entire other series centered around Salvatore and his past. He has secrets. I must know them.There's a certain beauty to having chapters titled after the character narrating them. It allows for a little more freedom, and for the reader to hone in on what's happening without having to remember who was where doing what and being jarred from chapter to chapter. I loved being able to follow the story from different perspectives in much the same way a tv series (or soap opera) is filmed in scenes. Sometimes the main characters are together and sometimes they're not, but it's a very good way to know what's happening all over. Somehow, it can also make the reader feel like they know more than character A or B, and results in yelling at the book and/or TV whatever the case may be.All in all, it was a fun, well written read, and a great way to spend a day outside by a pool. There were also a lot of other little tidbits like the gluten free bake shop that got me thinking, and reminded me of the gluten free baking mix I got from SwiftMix at the Market\u00a0the other day. I'd share the recipe, but you'll just have to come to the market if you're in Brandon\u00a0to buy it, and then let the deliciousness waft into your nostrils. My family isn't gluten free exactly, but cautious about how much gluten we eat, and frankly if someone can make a pizza mix that I can bake and involves yeast and isn't literally a flop then I'll buy it. SwiftMix was a total success - and I'll remind you again, yeast hates me, or my oven, or something.Great pizza, a pool and a great book. You want this one. Or Doing Max Vinyl, or Zombie Candy. Hell, just go get all three.So allow me to pester once more - Brooke - don't make this a trilogy. You're better than that.[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"244\"]\n Use the Force.

It shows Annie Ogden, the main character of this book and a man being stabbed. The diamond ring is of significance too. The title is not only intriguing, it\u2019s also apt for this book. The author actually showed 2 possible book covers with slight differences, on his Facebook page and asked his fans to choose one. I am so glad that the final cover that got chosen was the one I had voted for!The story revolves around Annie, her fianc\u00e9 Salvatore and her ex lover Michael. The characters are excellently created such that they are flawed and thus makes them people that you could easily have associated with, in real life. Their emotions are real and tangible. Annie is a very bold, beautiful yet complicated person. She complicates everything. Salvatore is a person who loves Annie so much, is jealous of Micheal but at the same time is downright understanding. Michael is a passionate and weird person. I say weird because he does things that no one would normally do, yet in his eyes it\u2019s perfectly normal. He is so obsessed with Annie. The love between him and Annie is described really well and you totally understand what a passionate and close relationship they had. Without being graphic, the author excels in conveying their burning desires and I think that\u2019s a mighty achievement!The book is written in first person narrative from the point of view of two people, Annie and Salvatore. I love first person narrative!. There is absolutely no confusion here because each chapter heading contains the name of the person whose point of view is discussed in that chapter. I liked this approach.The murder is set in such a way that you would think it\u2019s ABSOLUTELY impossible to find the killer. Each step during the investigation, only toughens the case rather than making it easy. I loved the book to bits for that. I love tough cases because finding a killer in such cases keep the whole book intriguing and unputdownable (my crazy computer thinks it\u2019s not a legit word!. There is a red underline for spell check. Jeez!). The author has really built a case that is believable and takes us step by step towards solving the case piece by piece until the whole puzzle is completed and the killer is found.Thrillers being my favorite genre and having read many a mystery by several top-notch authors, I take pride in the fact that I am able to solve cases and find the killer (most of the time) before the book ends . But that was not the case here. No no, my friend!. I couldn\u2019t put my finger on who that person was and finally when it was revealed, I was shocked, to say the least!. This book also makes you sit up and think about how much information about yourself you put up on the internet and how much access into your life, you are giving to anonymous people around you. It\u2019s creepy.The other significant characters are also built very well. I usually don\u2019t like it at all, if there are unanswered bits in a book. After reading, I had one single yet important question on my mind. I couldn\u2019t come up with an answer to that. So I wrote to Frederick. He wrote back promptly and answered the question for me. It perfectly made sense. I won\u2019t reveal the question here because it\u2019s like a spoiler. This book is *mind blowing*, I tell you. You have got to read it. Add it to your ever increasing pile of TBR right now. But put it right on top of the pile so that you read it first!!Frederick has officially made it to my favorite-authors-of-all-time list!. I give this book 5 stars, which by Goodreads standards mean \u2018it was amazing\u2019."}, {"userName": "Growing Up", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19309122-growing-up", "userReview": "I have a love-hate relationship with this book. There were things I really disliked about it and other things I really enjoyed, hence the reason I am awarding Collateral Damage a three and a half star rating.First off \u2013 I dislike the cover. The girl on the cover, looks pissed off and it\u2019s almost like she is giving the readers the finger (am I the only one who did a double take???).I liked that the chapters in the book were from the point of view of either Annie (the main character) or of Salvatore (Annie\u2019s fianc\u00e9). The book was fast paced and the reading was smooth through-out.What I really disliked about the book \u2013 was the believability factor. There were SO many things, that were way too far-fetched. A few examples:\u2022Annie\u2019s ex-boyfriend breaks into her sister\u2019s apartment, lies in wait for several hours and then emerges from a closet when Annie comes over to visit her. It is also discovered that this same ex-boyfriend, Michael, was the masked person who attacked Annie on the street as she was jogging the previous day (Michael claiming it was all so he could put an invitation into her pocket to go to a reunion party with him). If those aren\u2019t two HUGE red flags that this guy isn\u2019t playing with a full deck and to avoid him like the plague \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what is. Then Annie is stalked by Michael to her cabin hideout in the woods\u2026 so what does she do? She decides to hop in Michael\u2019s car with him, to drive for hours and hours\u2026 crossing State lines to go to his reunion party. All of this, without Annie even going home to grab some clothes, grab a toothbrush or speak to her fianc\u00e9 about the trip. Seriously \u2013 who would do that???\u2022At the reunion party, Michael\u2019s buddy and roommate is murdered (in his bedroom, with over a hundred people present at this house party). Michael is arrested for murder because his prints were on the murder weapon, which was his very own bayonet. What does Annie do? Plunks down $10,000 as a retainer for a lawyer. This just hours after, she discovers Michael had stolen her engagement ring off her finger, then lets her stress and worry about it and then announces to the entire reunion party that THEY (Annie and Michael) are engaged and slips the \u2018missing\u2019 ring back on her finger. (I don\u2019t know about all of you\u2026 but that sort of behavior would creep me out).\u2022After Annie and her friend June, are attacked, drugged unconscious, rolled up in carpet and thrown down a Florida sinkhole, where they are left for dead \u2013 the very next day they are catering a charity event.It was these types of things\u2026 the believability factor \u2013 that I just couldn\u2019t get over, which was frustrating as a reader because the rest of book was really good. The characters were interesting, the plot was fast paced and interesting.If this author worked on the believability factor of certain things - I would have rated this MUCH higher.So, if you don\u2019t care that much about believability (like I do)\u2026 and you like fast paced, modern who-done-its, you\u2019ll love this book."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5857837-robert", "userReview": "My actual rating is 3 1/2 stars . . . I was gifted a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. It took me a while to finish it because I stopped reading before giving it another chance. I just couldn't get into it at first, but I'm glad I did give it another shot. Overall, Collateral Damage is a good novel with a decent plot and interesting characters. However, as much as I wanted to give this book a higher rating, I just couldn't because of a few nagging details. First of all, the point of view threw me off at first. Collateral Damage is written in first person POV, but from the perspective of two different characters, Annie and her fiancee Salvatore. To the author's credit, he clears this up by giving each chapter a title (i.e. Annie or Salvatore, depending on whose perspective it is). This my first time reading a novel with that type of style. Don't get me wrong, it does work, and the author does a decent job, but as a reader it just confused me at first. I had to go back and re-read a few pages before noticing the change in chapter titles and realizing what the author was doing.While I enjoyed the story overall, some parts it just had me rolling my eyes. I thought Annie Ogden made some unbelievably bad choices. I don't want to spoil anything, but lets just say if an ex-lover of yours suddenly resurfaces and then does some really creepy things to you, why the hell would you just hop into his car and drive to Florida with him? This is after this creep did a couple of really cruddy things to you. Red flag, anyone? She makes a series of very poor choices with this guy, which is why, sadly, I just did not like Annie's character. Annie is a private investigator and Army veteran, so I expected her to have a bit more common sense. There's also a part of the story where she experiences a traumatic event and then the next day is helping a friend cater a charity event. Really? Just not very believable. That's really my main complaint of the story. There were also a few other minor issues in the writing, such as the occasional typo here and there, but I'm not a grammar cop, so I just read what the author meant. No biggie. However, and this is coming from someone who is a Corvette enthusiast, you would think that Chevrolet sponsored this novel by the amount of times \"Corvette\" or \"Vette\" was mentioned in the story. All it needed was the Chevy bow tie on the cover. I'm not exaggerating. I love Corvettes, but even I got a bit tired of seeing the brand. Just some friendly advice to the author . . . just say \"car\" after it's been established that the vehicle the character is driving is a Corvette. Also, unless the car is repainted, we don't need to know it's black after the first couple of times.If you can overlook some of the distracting issues I pointed out, I would recommend Collateral Damage, because it really was entertaining, flowed well, and easy to read."}, {"userName": "a_tiffyfit", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/263649-a-tiffyfit", "userReview": "Review to come!This was my first Annie Ogden mystery and holy moly what a book it was! Annie Ogden pissed me off SO BAD! I wanted to reach into the book and shake her madly to knock some sense into her!What she had been hung up on for the past 532 days, as she points out repeatedly, wasn't love. (The affair in Iraq while deployed there in the armed services.) Why else would she have to consider the proposal? One who is so \"madly in love\" wouldn't have to think about it for a moment! She wouldn't be thinking about what kind of home they would able to afford, what kind of job he would hold, where they would live, how they would pay their bills, etc. All of those practical matters wouldn't have crossed her mind! Obviously, even back then, she's had doubts about Michael and her relationship. Had she been madly in love as she claims, she would've jumped at Michael's \"marry me, right now, right here, at the camp\" where they were stationed, especially within the confines of life-and-death risks present day in and day out in Iraq.What Annie and Michael had was mostly lust and excitement. Their relationship, being together, adventuring on the crazy, impulsive, and fun things made both of them feel alive, and filled the gap of loneliness while they were far away in a foreign country. The intimacy and deep sharing of thoughts during such times made them think it was love, but not really. When Annie finally realizes this, there's been a few regrettable mistakes.Annie eventually realizes that what she has with Salvatore is genuine love, and of the kind that a mature person falls into. She also learns that she is happy with Salvatore, for he is genuine, honest, fun, reliable, protective, and considerate, as well as much, much more.By the time she is certain and is ready to move on and finally be rid of Michael from her system, events occur which keep her rooted in Florida. Author Frederick Lee Brooke keeps you guessing with this good old-fashioned \"who done it?\" mystery, and one can't help but to keep guessing on the perpetrator.At it's beginning, I did not like this book and couldn't get into it. However, in a matter of a few more pages turned, I was hooked! The plot is genuine, current, and believable with a mystery that is acceptable and deeply involving. There aren't any hitches upon which you stumble because the prose is that well-written. The characters are realistic - so much so that, like I said at the start, I wanted to shout at Annie for being an idiot.I'd recommend to this to anyone who likes to read, I don't care what genre is your normal! I feel like I've been missing out, not having met Annie, frustrating as I found her in the beginning, earlier and want to pick up the other two earlier books Doing Max Vinyl and Zombie Candy. Easily a 5 star read!"}, {"userName": "Lissette", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4008232-lissette", "userReview": "Annie Ogden's life has had its ups and downs. She's put up with a lot of things, and is finally settling into a semblance of normalcy. She now has a stable life, and a fiance she adores. Salvatore means everything to her, and she'll do everything she can to make him happy. In her mind, her life is going exactly how she wants it to, until the moment an unexpected attack one day throws everything she knows into limbo.To Annie's surprise, her ex-boyfriend, Michael Garcia, is back from the 'dead'. Though she'd love to tell everyone the truth surrounding Michael's supposed death, she knows that's a story she'll never be able to divulge. There's a reason she lied about the fact that he was still alive. Unfortunately, it's a secret she'll have to take to the grave.As details about Michael's sudden reappearance emerge, Annie soon realizes just how much her life has changed. Deep inside, she never stopped loving Michael. Though she may be tempted to reexamine her relationship, if you could call it that, with him, she knows there's no chance, whatsoever, of their ever becoming more than what they are now. She's in love with Salvatore. There's nothing she wouldn't do for him. So why is it difficult to let go of what she feels for Michael?When Michael is implicated in a murder, Annie comes to the realization that there's more he's not telling her. Getting to the bottom of the situation, unfortunately, is easier said done. Opposition comes at her from every corner, something she should have been used to from the get-go. Her life soon takes a different turn when the killer turns his attention to her. If she's to succeed in helping clear Michael of the charges, she'll need to play the killer's sordid game. The question is, can she do that without losing a piece of herself in the process?I've got to admit that I started this series out of turn, but that's ok. The way Frederick wrote this story makes it stand alone as its own novel. From the moment you open the book, you're caught up in Annie's tumultuous life. She's gone through so much, and has started to rebuild what's left of it that you can't help but to stand in a corner and root for her. Frederick has created such an intriguing world that anyone can relate to. The suspense certainly doesn't disappoint. I've a little catching up to do with books one and two, but I honestly can't wait. I look forward to more of Annie in the future."}, {"userName": "KyBunnies", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4782771-kybunnies", "userReview": "I am admitting upfront that I have NOT read the first two books in this series. The nice part about this series is that readers really do not need to read the other books. Yes, it helps some to know more information about the characters, BUT it is not required.When Annie\u2019s ex-boyfriend and fellow Army friend comes back into her life everything is turned upside down-inside out and just a mess. A mess of trouble that is. Michael is a friendly out going person who loves to play jokes/pranks on people. To do the outrageous, Michael even sit in a closet just to see/talk to Annie again. He is a little stalkish in behavior.Annie is getting her life back together after the army and being dumped by Michael. She now helps to run a successful PI business with her fianc\u00e9. This fianc\u00e9 is a little unusual, he does not seem the possessive or jealous type. He seems very laid back and casual in his relationship with Annie.When Michael is accused of killing his roommate Annie steps up to help clear his name. What she did not know is how far she reaches into her own family to get the true killer.To this reader this is one of those books that is easy to read, keeps you attention but does not drag on. It has just enough characters to keep everything interesting while providing the perfect balance in story/plot. I enjoyed that Brooks did not worry about adding needless sex scenes to this mystery (boarding on drama) story.I say it is boarding on drama because it seems that all the characters are very familiar with each other. They all have a connection from the past. Brookes provides just enough information to enlighten readers to characters past but does not overwhelm readers with the useless information/details that are not needed. At slightly over 336 pages this is a page turning book to keep you up late at night until finished.The bunnies and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this third book in the series and have moved the first two up on our TBR pile.The bunnies and I give this book  carrots.Please be aware that the review is my personal opinion.

I can't stop thinking about the story. Annie still aggravates me but I keep thinking that she annoyed me because the story was so well written. Plus, the story was complex but actually made sense. I will definitely read the next book I the series. Annie Odgen is a war vet and a private investigator. At the beginning of the story she is attacked while out jogging. Right after the attack her boyfriend asks her to marry him. And then her day just gets weird! I really wanted to love this story. I like Annie's backstory. I like her boyfriend Salvatore. I even liked Annie's bossy, obnoxious sister. I thought the writing was really good. So why the three star review? I can't quite pinpoint why the book didn't connect with me. I found myself finding things to do other than read. I really feel that it was because I never fully connected with Annie. Her thought processes actually made me angry. She wasn't too stupid to live just selfish and self centered to root for. Through the course of the story Annie disregards Salvatore's feelings and needs because she \"knows\" he will always be there for her. She makes assumptions about Salvatore's actions without actually talking to him. Of course, she does the same thing with her ex-boyfriend Michael. So, I give the author credit that he made the character react consistently. I hated the end. Plain and simple, it was abrupt and offered no closure at all. I don't mind a cliff hanger but this was all cliff hanger and no completion. I plan to read the next book in the series because I need that closure. Also, I want to give the author another chance because the writing was quite good.Quote:\"I never doubted myself for an instant. I knew if Salvatore found out he would be hurt.

I wanted to know about her past with Michael and what happened when she was on that fateful second tour in Iraq. Throughout the series, I think that was the greatest mystery of all. The twists and turns of this latest book take the reader deep inside Annie\u2019s head and heart. It\u2019s very hard to review this book without any spoilers. There are moments when we learn things about Annie that are shocking, but they also make her seem so truly human that you think she might walk right off the page. In this book, Brooke continues to paint his characters brilliantly. The kind you can relate to. Totally but beautifully imperfect. She has met the challenges of being a female soldier at war. Now she must be courageous enough to take on her personal demons.One of them being Michael. Throughout the series, Michael has been an enigma. We know Annie\u2019s hurting and we know he is the cause. Finally, their story is told. I wanted to like Michael so badly. I confess I spent a few chapters angry with him. But when he is accused of murder, Annie takes on the case, even after all he has done. In that sense, Annie is the bravest she has ever been. She puts her personal feelings and her own safety aside to seek justice and fight for what she knows is right.Collateral Damage is raw. It cuts to the bone. It\u2019s an amazing thrill ride. I couldn't put it down until I was finished at 4 AM. The title says it all. It\u2019s about the consequences of our decisions and who gets hurt in the wake. Collateral Damage gave me the closure I was looking for in Annie\u2019s story.

Brooke has a way of getting into the female psyche like no other man ever has, and he writes endearing and believable characters. He also puts them through their paces, and throws in some bizarre occurences, adding to the intrigue. This book certainly had me entertained from the very beginning. Annie is such a strong female MC, so I was a little surprised when she so willingly allowed Micheal to take over her life. I understand the shock of having him return, especially with his sudden devotion to her, but I would have expected her to kick his ass to the curb, not matter what emotions his return evoked. Okay, so she didn't just fall into his arms, she was adamant that she was with Sal, but some of her actions just made me want to reach into the book and slap some sense into her.  I wasn't really sure where this story was going, but the minute murder stepped in, the entire game changed. The plot thickened with each turn of the page and as certain revelations were made, so the suspense grew. I was on the edge of my seat, just waiting for that moment when the bubble would burst and all the crazy theories circling my brain would start to makes sense. But, boy, oh boy, was I blind-sided. The perp was a real sleazeball but never had I imagined the part he'd truly played in this tale of lies and deception. Quite the shocker. Brooke skillfully crafted a story full of excitement and intrigue, giving just enough away to keep me wanting more, but never to the point where I, for one second, thought a really knew what was about to happen.

Things seem to go in the right direction for the couple, but when Annie's ex-boyfriend comes back, everything is going to get too complicated. How can Annie cope with an ex-boyfriend with stalkerish tendencies and a very jealous fianc\u00e9? What if things get even more complicated by a bossy sister and an obsessive brother-in-law? What if we add murder to this? We get a very thrilling book that is worth reading.We get to see the story told at different points by different characters, so we learn things from different points of views. I don't really like it when books are written using the first-person narrator, but in this case it was very well done and you don't get lost because every chapter tells you who the narrator is. The character development is fine, since all the characters are quite complex and not stereotypical.I found very few typos and the ones I did find didn't interfere with the reading of the story. However, I predicted the ending when I had read a bit more of half the book, so that's my reason for removing one star (one penguin in my blog)."}, {"userName": "Simon Jenner", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6774993-simon-jenner", "userReview": "I was lucky enough to be an early reader for \u2018Collateral Damage\u2019. I loved Annie, the kick-ass heroine, from \u2018Doing Max Vinyl\u2019 and it was great to see her again doing what she does best, taking matters into her own hands to ensure the bad guys get what\u2019s coming to them.From the first scene, we are thrown into the action and the story keeps up the pace from there, moving seamlessly through a love triangle, an innocent being accused of murder and on to an obsession that puts Annie in mortal danger. We get to learn more about our favourite heroine and her past with Michael, but I wanted to shake her for putting up with him and his antics. She is too good for him. I particularly enjoyed getting to know Salvatore. He was a very interesting, believable character and his investigations were pacey and exciting. I could easily see him in a spin-off series but am hoping Annie Ogden #4 will see Annie and Salvatore working together. Annie\u2019s friend June was another enjoyable supporting character with depth. My favourite heart-racing scene was when Annie and June got themselves in \u2018too deep\u2019 \u2013 prepare yourself for that one. As for the \u2018whodunnit\u2019 part \u2013 I had no early ideas as to who the baddie might be. It was definitely a tough case to crack and played out well.

The calculus changes when Michael is arrested for murder. When Salvatore refuses to help investigate, Annie is forced to try to find the killer herself.

Unfortunately i have only read the last 2 books never had the chance to read the first one, but i can imagine how good it could be. The book i just got it today to do a review on it for the blog post so please bear with me i will do my best to not reveal to much but to make you understand what it is about. The series are about Annie, but Collateral it explain more about her past and what happen in Iraq. She seams to have created a normal and good life since she came back until her ex comes after her (when everyone else though he was dead). Now she is cut between him that does not leave her alone and her actual fiance that everyone likes. Michael (the ex) is trying to get Annie back trying to be Romantic writing her a poem, but the bad side of him keeps on coming to the surface. Also what is wrong about him that he acts he does not know what he is doing wrong, or that is just a joke to him. Salvador is a prince compare with Michael, he treats Annie very nice, trust her, protective and romantic.

But it didn't really matter as I thoroughly enjoyed this mystery as a stand alone story and was able to understand fully all of the characters and their backgrounds as the story progressed. I really liked the format with two alternating points of view by Salvatore and Annie. The dialogue and action sequences were excellently done, at times endearing Salvatore and/or Annie to me, and at other times making me dislike Salvatore's reasoning or Annie's emotions and feelings. The secondary characters (Michael, Todd and Annie's sister) were also very cleverly done so as to really get my ire up over their shenanigans. And all through the story and action I could really feel the mystery and had questions buzzing in my brain until all became clear to me just as things became clear to Salvatore and Annie. In short, the story and mystery grabbed my attention from the outset and kept it all the way through to the very end. And it wasn't really a cliffhanger of an ending, but this reader could definitely tell that there would be other stories following this one--and that was pretty smart writing by Mr. Brooke because I'm definitely interested in what comes next."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4975421-susan", "userReview": "Collateral Damage is the first book that I have read in the Annie Ogden series, and I found it to be an enjoyable read. I really liked Brooke's writing style which was easy to read and gave the reader the opportunity to switch characters point of view between Annie and Salvatore. The character development of Annie is well done as the character finds her world turned upside down with the arrival of her ex just as she becomes engaged to Salvatore. There were some moments that I became frustrated with the Annie character as she made a choice that came back to bite her later, but overall she was a good character that captures your interest and makes you want to follow her. Salvatore however proved to be my favorite character in the book so I was thrilled to get the chance to get inside his head and get his feelings on what was going on. He was also well developed and while he too made some mistakes he helped add to the overall story with giving the reader two sides of the case. Brooke develops a good mystery, and I enjoyed how he ended up tying things together into a compelling mystery with a satisfying ending.

This book definitely made me want to get to the next chapter quickly. The character descriptions were well thought out but the actions lacked a bit of believability. While the plot was similar to many stories, it still had you guessing who the murderer was up until the end. I usually like to feel something for the characters I read about.
