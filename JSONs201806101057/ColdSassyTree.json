A joy to read, and re-read, and share with all your friends, I give you my review of a story that is a treasured friend..._______________________After reading the book jacket, I approached this recommendation with a \"hrmph\", as my mind jumped ahead to hurl the first sentence of my review: \"life was pretty good in the south after the Civil War as long as you weren't black or poor.\" Quite frankly, I had been wrestling with the injustice of racism and was in no mood either appreciate the segregated culture of the south in which it persisted, or to see it romanticized. But then I started reading, and I was captivated. The humor of the story and the joy of life of the characters gave the book a clean feel of a simpler time as it unwound from the pages to ensnare my heart with a great, grand, ole yarn. Yet at the same time, running like a deep aquifer alongside a jolly racing blue thread of a river, themes about death (young, old, suicide are all covered), grieving, God, love gained and lost, abuse, depression and forgiveness are watering the story with a life that is penetrating to the soul. You might not notice it though, for all the fun in the visible flow of stories.It is a sad reality that \"colored folk\" are an unalterable part of the setting and they are (true to life) pictured as a community apart that get the lower jobs. However, they are respected by the main characters for the contribution they make to their lives and their families. The theme of racism is not explored. References to the lost Civil War and glory of the confederacy are mentioned merely as the way of life at the time, not as ideas to be pondered, developed, or embraced. \"White trash\" is also touched upon as a class, and in many ways, treated worse than the colored folk. The end of the book for me was a revelation of the deep ideas highlighting a tapestry of narrative and dialogue, and it stuck with me. I will remember the character of Grandpa, E. Rucker Blackslee for a long time... he challenged me during a difficult period of my life, and I think I'm better for it.A note on recommendations. I highly recommend this book. The main characters include both male and female, I think both men & women would enjoy this read. However, because of a reference to abuse, which is tactfully dealt with, I would reserve the book for high school and above.Gone with the Wind, Mitchell, 1936https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...To Kill a Mockingbird, Lee, 1960https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...The Help, Stockett, 2009https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...For a completely different subject by an author that reminds me of Olive Ann Burns diligent writing style poured into a few exceptional titles, seeCity of Tranquil Light, Caldwell, 2010 https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "[ Miss Love\u2019s rape and Uncle Campbell\u2019s suicide.

This is such a great book. It nearly ripped my heart out for making me think of my Grandmother. It is about a 14 year old boy in 1906 Cold Sassy, Georgia. The book centers on Will Tweedy's relationship with his grandfather and the small town scandal that begins when his grandfather remarries a young woman two weeks after his wife's passing. The narrative is so witty and touching and it is written in such a strong southern dialect that I found myself thing in terms of \"dern it\" and \"I reckon\"!

It includes something for everyone: racism, sexism, chauvinism, religious prejudice, and \"yankeeism\". It is like an all you can read buffet of ignorance.But there's something for the romantics too! A charming love story about a vile old adulterer, whom after lusting for years after a woman young enough to be his daughter, he finally marries her three short weeks after he buries his wife of decades. (Well he had to move fast in case \"someone else got her first\"). Thankfully I read this one via the audiobook version as it would have been an even slower and more painful read otherwise due to the thick southern vernacular: If\u2019n you\u2019d a-got kilt, it\u2019d mean you jest didn\u2019t move fast enough, like a rabbit that gits caught by a hound dog.

She was a seasoned writer, but not a novelist, and clearly, she knew how to tell a story. This book represents everything I love about reading and writing. There's an \"old school\" feel here, an indescribable quality that takes me back to sitting in trees as a child, my back supported by the trunk and my young mind supported by whatever precious book I held propped in my hand.What joy, to think about those days, and that joy is somehow captured here in this coming-of-age novel. It was written in 1984 (as I was sitting in those trees reading Carson McCullers), but the story takes place much earlier in the century.I can't say that I can find fault with anything in this story. The plot, the developed characters, the author's successful use of Voice, the likable narrator. . . are all exceptional. And, if all of that is too mechanical for you, you can also find adventure, history, romance and religious and philosophical insights.It was an absolute privilege to read it, and I'm thankful I discovered it as I was sick in bed with a bad cold."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1883816-barbara", "userReview": "This is the portrayal of the town of Cold Sassy, named for the huge Sassafras tree in its midst, which the inhabitants had frequently debated on renaming. The time period is set in the early 1900's in the South. Initially I was annoyed by the use of the local vernacular and associated grammatical errors, but I gradually adjusted to it and accepted that it was an effective and necessary factor to the telling of the tale.The nub of the story is the coming of age of 14 year old Will. The plot developed slowly, but I became invested in the characters of Will and his family, especially his grandfather and his grandfather's second wife. Burns has also drawn a clear picture of his neighbors and friends. Typical of small town southern life there was the gossip, the exaggerated sense of morality and certainly the lack of privacy in actions and thoughts. It was impressive to view the development of historical events- first cars, first bathrooms, first running water, clothing and early motor cars. It was a simpler time in some respects, but a more difficult time because people had to do so much physical labor just to live and the lacked materials which are so prevalent in modern life.. Burns has blended much humor with periods of suspense and principals of wisdom. It is a lengthy book, but it contains much to draw in the reader. Members of my local book club enjoyed this with few exceptions and we had an extensive discussion period. Also of interest, was the fact that Olive Burns wrote this, her first book, at the age of 60!"}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51209-emily", "userReview": "I actually really liked this book, but I think I enjoyed the cultural and historical aspects of it more than the story, to be frank. Burns paints a wonderful picture of life in a small and changing southern town in the early 20th century. The depiction of the social tensions between the \"lintheads\" who work in the cotton mills and the rest of the town hit the nail on the head, in terms of the southern industrial mill era. We also see the coming of the automobile and the way that the town is still stuck in the Civil War. As a coming of age story, its pretty good, but I liked it more for the culture Burns evoked while writing about the town."}, {"userName": "\u2728Susan\u2728", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21276121-susan", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book but it fell a little flat, it had some good parts but I was expecting more because of the outstanding reviews.

Now, she wasn't really an avid reader, so I figured that hey, if she loved it and it got her to finish the book, it's probably pretty good.Fast forward more years than I'd care to admit and I've finally read it. Oh my. I am so, so disappointed. I understand that a lot of people love this book--and that's great! I'm not attacking you or judging you or anything. I'm just saying that I really, really didn't like Cold Sassy Tree.The overall feel of the book was so melodramatic, yet unfocused, that it was really jarring to read. Things would just happen BAM! for shock value, I suppose, and then everything would go right back to the way it was. There was a particularly annoying tendency for the narrator (thus also the author) to say something like, \"but I didn't know then that everything would change\" or something along those lines. Honey, that's not really how I like my foreshadowing.Also, no one in this book was particularly likeable. I suppose we're meant to like Grandpa and Miss Love, and Will Tweedy, the narrator, but I was really put off by the way they just go along with the hypocrisy of their fellow townsfolk. They realize that their neighbors are nasty hypocrites, but oh well, what can you do? Gah. Finally, I really take issue with this being seen as the sort of \"successor\" to To Kill a Mockingbird. To my dismay and anger, I read a few reviews a while back about TKAM that described it as juvenile and not very well-written. Please. TKAM is so spot-on, so meaningful, and created such wonderful characters that it is leagues away from Cold Sassy Tree. Plus, besides being set in the South, they don't have similar storylines at all. Although I did get the feeling that Burns was trying to do a sort of follow-up to TKAM. No. Just no.So you may like it, you may love it, or you may not. Your mileage may indeed vary.

The characters are vibrant, the language is rich and there are good life's lessons throughout--but it's not preachy. This is a story told with lots of humor although it does have it's tear-jerker moments. Young Will Tweedy is 14 at the turn of the century and is living in the town of Cold Sassy, Georgia. His grandfather causes an uproar in this sleepy little town by eloping with the beautiful young employee in his store. That's bad enough but what really sets the tongues to wagging is that Grandpa's first wife just passed three weeks ago and is barely cold in the grave. The events subsequent to this scandalous event changes Will's outlook on life forever. He has an \"old\" grandpa who is made young again by the pretty young wife and he himself begins to grow up as he romanticizes about women, kisses someone for the first time, and drives around town in his grandfather's new automobile.

I love this book, it's so delightful, the characters are so human with their fears, and pettiness and prejudices and lusts. It had a lot of humor in it as well, like when the grandpa decided eloped with the millner (hat maker) 2 weeks after the grandma died, and his excuse was, \"she's as dead as she's ever gonna be!\" But we didn't doubt his devotion to the grandma, because he completely lined her grave with cut roses from her rose garden.

I found the story, particularly the main story of an old man and a middle-aged woman falling in love compelling and believable. However, the book had some major flaws, in my opinion.1. The dialect is painful. \"Cause if'n you do, or if'n you have a mind to after you git over bein' so mad at him, why, we could git this'n annulled. Folks in Cold Sassy will have a good time talkin', but if you go on off to Texas, why, you won't have to put up with nothin' on account of it. So you want to marry him or don't you? (177)\"2. The suicide scene is shocking, with no foreshadowing, and is completely without purpose. No one is changed by Uncle Camp's death. No one's character is further developed through it.3. The book relied too heavily on the \"overheard conversation\" technique. Really, really beyond belief. Will overhears: declarations of love, revelations of rape and incest, discussions of theology, heavy petting, repentence for infedelity, reunions of lovers, confessions of past sins, among other things. 4. The message that organized religion was always wrong, and that any rebellion against it was to be considered correct and common sense wearied me after a while. The back of the book said, \"Not since To Kill a Mockingbird has a novel so deftly capture the subtle crossscurrents of small-town southern life.\" Hmmm. . .

It made me look a little more at myself and see which character I fit - the gossips of the town, the drama queen mother, the one willing to press forward cheerfully not matter how others treat me . . . it was good reflection.

This is the witty coming-of-age story of Will Tweedy from Cold Sassy, Georgia. He loves fighting, telling stories, and driving his daddy's cadillac, but most of all he loves his Grandpa Blakeslee. They have a sweet relationship and although the story is filled with minor scandal (1920's deep-south kind of scandal) and intrigue, the focus of the book is the relationship between a grandpa and his boy. I have to include my favorite part of the book. Rucker Blakeslee is talking to his second wife, Love Simpson Blakeslee, about his views on faith and God, and it is beautiful. \u201dWell\u2019m, faith ain\u2019t no magic wand or money-back gar\u2019ntee, either one.

I know it for a fact, Love. I can pray \u2018Lord, hep me not be scairt,\u2019 and I don\u2019t know how, but it\u2019s like a eraser wipes the fears away.

I'd expected, naively I suppose, for a bitter sweet, heartfelt novel along the lines of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' (the blurb on the front cover hinted that fans of Lee's book were in for a treat); instead, I was soon driven mad by a contrived plot, full of nauseating sentiment and cheesy melodrama. The plot is so contrived, in fact, that the narrator is constantly unable to explain how events he describes came to pass, and chooses instead simply to ask the reader to believe that it happened.The dreadful story was bad enough, but the portion of the book I read seemed to read like an anti-TKAM - the one-dimensional characters seemed perfectly comfortable with their Deep Southern prejudices (the fact that all of the town's other white folk shared the same opinions was apparently reason enough for their snobbish, racist views), and the author's treatment of her novel's black characters was, at best, patronising. Unlike Scout and Atticus, none of the characters had any redeeming qualities, and in fact were all pretty detestible in their own way.I've rarely been left so disappointed by a novel, and the fact that this is only the fourth that I've ever failed to finish is testament to this. This is definitely one to avoid, unless you fancy some cheap chick-lit to tide you over on your holiday to Europe.

The plot was so easy going and I really felt like I was watching a movie. Burns did a great job with the southern accent - it must have taken her forever to spell each word how it would have been pronounced with a southern accent.

Southern fiction is one of my absolute favorite genres and certainly close to my heart since I am from the South. I didn\u2019t know anything about the book before reading the summary. Upon reading the summary, I anticipated a heavily plot driven story about the events after Mr. Blakeslee marries Miss Simpson.The characters of Cold Sassy made the book for me, despite the fact I hated most of them. In a way, though, I think the reader was supposed to hate some of them. I felt like Mrs. Tweedy and Loma weren\u2019t extremely developed, though I wouldn\u2019t have liked them much more if they were. The dislike is not due to bad writing, it\u2019s just the type of characters they are. Essentially, they are pretty much just like the rest of traditional, gossipy Cold Sassy, we are just supposed to feel more sympathy for them because they are related to the narrator. Personally, I didn\u2019t feel much for either of them.Miss Love, Will, and Grandpa stole the novel for me. Will irritated me to no end at many points in the story, but being a fourteen year old boy that doesn\u2019t surprise me. He\u2019s a bit hypocritical and makes some terrible awful choices, but I think in the end he has a good heart. Despite his made up stories and wishy washy opinions, I still felt for him and enjoyed reading him as a narrator. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, so I won\u2019t say much other than I think Miss Love is great. She\u2019s a solid character and a feisty one too. She was easily the best character in the novel for me.The rest of the cast was great too. Aside from Loma and Mrs. Tweedy, I felt even the minor characters, like Hosie, were developed and really made me care for them which is why I stuck it out to the end.The plot was the most disappointing part of the novel for me. I had expected a whirlwind of events and scandals, but really not much happened in the book. I mean, sure, a few big events happened, but they weren\u2019t played out at all. Something major would happen every 75 to 90 pages, the characters would react for a few paragraphs, and then everything would go right back to normal in the next chapter. Even the events that completely turned a character\u2019s life upside down weren\u2019t really described much. I felt like a few of the big events and reveals were unnecessary. They did nothing for the plot and were completely disregarded/barely mentioned for the rest of the novel. The few things that did happen that seemed to have a purpose still didn\u2019t have much attention. The plot of this book is basically Will Tweedy eavesdropping on Miss Love and Mr. Blakeslee, not telling anyone what they said, and making up outlandish stories about Loma. That\u2019s it. The other major \u201cplot points\u201d are hardly commented on by Will Tweedy. Maybe that\u2019s what the author was going for, since he is a na\u00efve, young narrator, but I just didn\u2019t like it. The book moved slow and if it wasn\u2019t for a few of my favorite characters it would have been much harder to finish.The writing in the book fell short for me. There were some truly beautiful passages about love, loss, and even religion. However, the author\u2019s use of foreshadowing was awful, overdone, and melodramatic. Nearly every chapter ended in some sort of variation of \u201cbut then everything would change.\u201d Personally, I don\u2019t care how much or how little foreshadowing an author uses, but at least use it subtly. Some of the chapters would be so captivating and interesting that I didn\u2019t want to stop, but those lines of obvious foreshadowing always brought me back to reality with a sharp eye roll. The chapters were also very strange. I\u2019m one of those readers who likes for a chapter to represent a whole scene, plot point, or message. I\u2019m not picky on length or even that the lengths match throughout the book, but it truly irks me when chapters end abruptly and then pick right back up at the same place. That coupled with the awful foreshadowing is probably the reason the novel didn\u2019t get more than three stars. When a chapter ends suddenly and with a bold statement of foreshadowing then proceeds to pick back up right where the other chapter left off, it really draws back my focus. Like chapters eleven and twelve. They are literally the same event, the author just decides to end chapter eleven with some sort of bold statement and then on the next page continue the events of the story. Maybe I\u2019m just being picky, but examples like that are what really took away from the story for me.The southern dialect was a bit heavy handed. I\u2019m from the south; believe me when I say I have family who speak exactly like the characters of the novel. It was still hard for me to understand at times, but it wasn\u2019t terrible. There ended up being just a few sentences I had to reread a few times.Despite all my complaints, I really did find a lot of the writing to be very lively and emotional. Some of the more intimate moments between Grandpa and Miss Love were touching, even bringing a tear to my eye. I thought the author did fantastic with giving the reader a small southern town feel. The descriptions of the town and the time period were vivid. There were times when I could really picture the town and people of Cold Sassy.Overall, I was rather disappointed in this book. It didn\u2019t live up to my expectations. I had really hoped for a very exciting story with a lot of town gossip, witty characters, and unpredictable events. Still, I was satisfied with what I got. What Cold Sassy Tree lacks in action it almost makes up for with its charm. The characters I did like, the descriptions, and the heartfelt moments made this book still worth reading.TLDR: Pros: Great portrayal of old, southern townsInteresting charactersCharmingSome scenes will really stick with meCons: Terrible, melodramatic foreshadowing Odd chapter formatHeavy southern dialectRecommend: For people who enjoy character driven stories, stories with religion as part of the theme, and fans of southern fiction."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "3.5 stars. I really liked this book, but I found it much easier to listen to this book than to read it. I grew up in the south, but I still had a hard time with the vernacular as it was written in this book. The 'should/would/could of' ones got me the most, more than 'terreckly' in place of 'directly', 'cain't' in place of 'can't' etc, because I kept thinking it sounds exactly the same if you write 'could've', etc, so why purposefully write it wrong? Listening to it was much less distracting. I really loved the characters in this story, which is a good thing, because this is such a character driven story that lacking amazing characters, there would be no story to tell. The story is these characters' lives; their faith and their deaths and their scandals and their everyday. My favorite character was Grandpa Blakeslee. I loved his take on life. I loved his take on faith and loyalty and life in general. He was just such a refreshing character to meet, one who had such a realistic and \"homegrown\" faith and relationship with his God. I loved his take on faith, that it is not a guarantee or reward, but rather a way of life.I really liked Will Tweedy as a narrator. I liked that he was young and in the thick of things because he was at that middling age where one is almost adult but still considered a child when it comes to adult issues, so he was privy to a lot of things that he maybe shouldn't have been, but his interpretation of those things was nothing if not interesting. The foreshadowing was a little heavy handed, but it served its purpose, and in a novel as gossipy as this one, it worked pretty well.I would have liked for a few of the social issues, like prejudice and racial segregation and women's rights to be addressed more fully... all were touched upon, but none really explored at all. Overall, I really liked the book. I think that Grandpa Blakeslee will stick with me for a while after reading this one. He's just one of those characters that imprint a part of themselves on everyone who meets them."}, {"userName": "Joan Bannan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42252751-joan-bannan", "userReview": "Oh my! What a find. What a great book! I need to look up which of my Goodreads friends reviewed this and brought it to my attention. Thank you! I joined Goodreads because I HAVE to read and want to read great books. As I read the last page of this book, my first thought was, \"I love Goodreads!\"At a time when we are questioning our reverence for Confederate history, this book brings to light the heart of Confederate humility and loyalty. This is a story of a young man, Will Tweedy, as he sorts out family values, community prejudices, Christian assumptions, and his hope for the future in a changing society. Will shares with us his dreams, his pranks, his mourning of a best friend, the loss of his grandmother, his being the first young man in his community to drive an automobile, and his first kiss. Central to Will's life is his Grandfather Blakeslee, who scandalizes the town when he marries a young, pretty woman, three weeks after his wife dies and saying, \"Miss Mattie Lou was as dead as she'd ever be.\" This book is adroitly written in such diverse ways. The story was captivating. The characters were well developed and lovable. The voice was amazing! I could not have done what this author did. She captured the voice of a young boy becoming a man and used the southern dialect in such a way that I fell into it. Found myself thinking in a \"down-south, down-home\" way. And yet, with very few exceptions I was able to follow the meaning in sentences without getting lost. I couldn't read as fast as I usual, but I got it. And I loved it.This book would probably mean more to you if you are a Christian, but it's so great, I think you would love it even if you were not."}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2206131-steven", "userReview": "Fantastic characters and a good plot. I loved the setting, the old South, the gossipy small town and the funny, quircky, but very believable people. This is an excellent picture of life at the turn of the century, including the advent of the automobile, electric lights and indoor plumbing. It's also an interesting coming-of-age tale told by a 14-year-old boy. This book is excellent. I was just a little surprised by the dark turn it takes toward the end. Primarily because my kids had enjoyed listening to so much of it in the car (an audio book), but as the story progressed I found myself unwilling to let them listen to the last few chapters. That criticism is hardly relevant for most adult readers--this book is not marketed for kids, and it's actually quite tame. It's no \"Beloved,\" and hardly even a \"Sula\" or \"the Color Purple.\" It's a great southern tale in a context that is vividly pictured, vividly alive. But the book started out in Mayberry and began to drift elsewhere toward the end. The result is not unrealistic. Maybe that's even the point of a coming-of-age tale, or an initiation-maturation plot: the hero does lose some innocence, perhaps, seeing things he'd not known before. Anyway, GREAT BOOK."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1552553-mary", "userReview": "Just finished Cold Sassy Tree.Excellent \"tiny\" insights into human nature in the 1906 South which speak volumes. Told thru the eyes of a young boy, the story begins around the death of his grandmother. This observant and sensitive boy seems to understand more than most of the wagging tongues in his little town. The book unwinds through an absolutely crucial year in the life of this boy--the beginning of manhood through experiencing pain and understanding. Someone wrote, it's a funny book about death. Death is commonplace in that period, and it begins to effect Will, the protagonist. Olive Ann Burns is noted for her ear, her ability to produce dialect faithfully. You might find yourself speaking like the characters in the book if you're not careful! Burns handles the first person perspective well and it's a good perspective because essentially, this is a coming of age novel. I'd mark this as terrific read and would recommend it to all of my friends.Unfortunately, Ms Burns died before editing or finishing the sequal to this, so it probably wouldn't be as strong and as well written as this."}, {"userName": "Lisa Kay", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2459470-lisa-kay", "userReview": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729 Turn of the century coming-of-age story told a young adolescent boy, Will Tweedy, who sides with his curmudgeonly grandfather, a store owner bent on marrying a younger woman. I don\u2019t know which is worse in the eyes of this small town Georgian life: the fact that she is \u201cpractically a Yankee\u201d or it is only two weeks after the death of his beloved grandmother.I had mixed feelings about some parts of it as there are some racial words and mores that, in all honesty, were prevalent for that era. Still, it is a compelling story with Will Tweedy making cringe-worthy mistakes and has several life lessons well illustrated. Indeed, one of which is that you can love two people who don\u2019t necessarily love each other.

And a great and enjoyable read it was. Likeable, quirky characters, a lot of tongue-in-cheek humour as well as swift yet poignant enough action. No wonder that it was made into a movie. I can imagine it can be very good. The story is narrated through the eyes of a precocious fourteen year old, and takes place in Cold Sassy, a small town in Georgia in 1906 and 1907. It starts with a patriarch of the family announcing that he is marrying a twenty something younger woman less than three weeks after his wife\u2019s death. All sorts of complications follow, and we learn a lot about life in the southern small town at the turn of the century.If you have a chance, listen to it. It\u2019s superbly read by Grover Gardner.

It hits on all cylinders -- it's hilariously funny, it's poignant, it's sad, it's witty, it's a historical snapshot, it's quintessentially southern -- and perhaps those with a similar background will understand it best. Maybe you can hear your relatives saying similar things. I read it in 9th grade b/c it was required reading, and I was never the same...I have read it multiple times. I \"made\" my husband read it when we were dating. The author and I were born on the same day (July 17), so this is all around book kismet for me.
