There is lots of history in this book. Most of this is correct and it is in keeping with what actually happened in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.Unfortunately, it takes away from the story. The story almost seems secondary to the historical perspective of the story line. Even though it is a Gabriel Allon book, it seems that there is lack of focus in this book, where it drifts along. Not as focused or as quick moving as the rest of the Silva books!However, it is a part of the development of the Allon character books. That was fun and was worth the read. But, this is far from Silva's best work!"}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2330809-steve", "userReview": "Either the series and the characters are growing on me, the author (Silva) has finally hit his stride, the series is steadily improving, or, I dunno, it's some combination of the above. In any event, I really enjoyed this one and, frankly, once I started it, I had no interest in putting it down. I can't say I read it in one sitting, but (particularly given the book's length) it flew by pretty quickly.I took the bait from the opening pages, the plot was complex enough such that I didn't see the big diversion coming, the pacing worked great, some familiar characters evolved in satisfying ways, and the conclusion and springboard to the next installment were sufficiently gratifying such that I'm looking forward to it.Like the others, most of the familiar elements are here - plenty of Israeli intelligence cloak and dagger and murder and mayhem - a healthy dollop of Arab/PLO/Palestinian displacement and politics and forks in the road - some Holocaust and Middle Eastern history spiced up with historical fiction spanning the evolution to modern terrorism - a dabble into art, art history, and art restoration - and some fun travelogue/passport punching, including Israel, France, Egypt, and, of course, Italy....DON'T START HERE, you'll be sorry to, in effect, be dropped into the middle of a long-running conversation. Start with the first book - it's worth it - and stick with it because, at least to my mind - the books keep getting better."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3229150-peter", "userReview": "The fifth book of Daniel Silva\u2019s series featuring art-restorer and Israeli avenger Gabriel Allon shows in small ways his growth as a writer. In Prince of Fire, the technical aspects of the plot play second fiddle to the people side of the story, although the plot doesn\u2019t lack for suspense or mystery.The ongoing battle against Palestinian terrorism plays itself out on the battlefield of Allon\u2019s guilt over the loss of his son and the injury suffered by his wife Leah. An incidental consequence of his obligation to Leah, despite the fact as this novel begins she has not said a word to him in more than a dozen years, is the aborted legal consummation of his relationship with Italian-born Chiara.Another aspect of the human side of the story is the relationship of Allon to Shamron, his father substitute. The latter continues to manipulate Allon to serve his ends, knowing Allon can\u2019t say no to him. Shamron wants him to take over running the \u201cOffice,\u201d while Allon just wants to restore medieval art.Prince of Fire doesn\u2019t paper over the suffering of the Palestinian people but accurately places the bulk of the responsibility for the refugee problem on the Arab leaders of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt who refused to allow ten percent of the British mandate to be allocated as a Jewish state and instead sought to drive the six hundred thousand Jews living in Palestine in 1947 into the Mediterranean.Then failing to accomplish that goal, those same leaders refused to integrate the refugee population into their countries, forcing them into squalid camps which became the breeding grounds for terrorism they remain nearly seventy years later.Allon explains the problem to a member of his team: \u201cThe only difference between Hamas and Hitler is that Hamas lacks and power and the means to carry out an extermination of the Jews.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t mean the Palestinians have any interest in a peaceful settlement, which is why Daniel Silva continues to find fertile territory for his brilliant story telling. It always comes back to the people who didn\u2019t ask for war, but for whom war can\u2019t be escaped."}, {"userName": "Terri Pickett", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5413586-terri-pickett", "userReview": "I didn't love the book but it's context was compelling.

One quote that I liked (regardless of this book being pro-Israeli\" is that quote from an Arab \"My holocaust is as real as yours, and yet you deny my suffering and exonerate yourself of guilt\". I don't believe that the Arabs can call what happened to them as a Holocaust, strange that Silva would think that. There is even mention in the book of \"genocide\".So having been to Israel and Syria and Egypt...well, I struggled with this book more so this one than any of his previous books."}, {"userName": "Ric", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2990467-ric", "userReview": "This is a more serious book than any of the later books in the series (at least, of the ones I've read). Daniel Silva is more evidently on a soapbox, linking more of the story's fiction to his version of history and reality. Unfortunately, this reminds me of efforts such as The Da Vinci Code in which the author professes that the fiction is based on facts --- but which facts, and whose interpretation of facts? As with the scientific method, which eschews all aspects of bias in its blind test, any hint of tainting invalidates the results. And so I can only approach such books as Prince Of Fire as entertainment, discounting whatever the author claims to be truth.Taken in this light, the novel is engaging, in the nature of a frivolous feel good action movie, where good prevails over evil, and the righteous are justified. Silva writes with a panache that is quite apt for spy thrillers. His is opposite the tongue-in-cheek machinations of Ian Fleming, hewing more to John le Carr\u00e9 and filled with gravitas, quite sure of his message and purpose.Here, the main protagonist, Gabriel Allon, an Israeli assassin who is also an expert art restorer, is set to end his career. His wife, the victim of a terrorist attack meant to kill him, is abducted, in a delightfully convoluted plot by master jihadist Khaled. With the skill of a trained killer, Allon escapes the trap set by Khaled, saves his wife, and kills some terrorists. Silva's writing is spare and hi-res clear, placing readers in the middle of the action. The rest of the book seems to be a setup for the retirement of Allon, with an offered promotion to operational administration of the Israeli spy service, the return of his wife's memory and the departure of his young lover, Keira, and his relocation to Jerusalem. But, of course, we know that retirement for Allon is far in the horizon as the number of follow up books featuring this popular hero attest. The book concludes with an uninspired (from the writing viewpoint) assassination by Allon of Khaled. This last seems a superfluous element but underlines the author's concept that the cause represented by his main character Allon is just with closure achieved only by a victorious Prince of Fire."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6755739-mark", "userReview": "This 5th thriller in the Gabriel Allon sees a change as Allons alter ega gets outed and he has to leave Venice and live in Israel. In the opening of this book the embassy of Israel in Rome is hit by an murderous attack with a high bodycount, and of course Allon with a small team gets picked to figure out who is behind it. Of course they quickley find a possible lead and when they follow it Gabriel Allon finds himself under fire.This book is a decent thriller, and in my humble opinion a failure in making it a really great thriller. The background of this book is the creation of the state of Israel and the trouble that came from it. Instead of going into the source of the trouble we get a somewhat shallow, for my taste, explanation which in itself lacks any heart. It therefor restricts itself to chasing a killer whose roots lie in the old Palastine.A missed opportunity, but perhaps mr Silva's interest lies more with the world of art and less with any geopolitical ideas. It makes this book easily one of the lesser of the series and a bit of a put off."}, {"userName": "Rose", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56832998-rose", "userReview": "Another great read - by Daniel Silva. His writing style involves great action, with what must be and endless amount of research and investigation into historic events, and cities. The Israeli-Palestinian history and turmoil is well handled in \u201cThe Prince of Fire\u201d, and he delves deep into Gabriel Allon\u2019s life and background in this one. I have enjoyed all of his seven books that I have read so far, some just a little more than others.His writing style requires a break from book to book for me, as there is so much action \u2013 that before I continue on a bit of a breather is a must before picking up the next story!"}, {"userName": "Christiana Moffa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26227-christiana-moffa", "userReview": "This books goes deeper into Gabriel's past and delves into his open emotional wounds about his wife, son, lover... it is simply remarkable as the reader learns that Gabriel was a young assassin chosen to be a part of the Black September operation.

Gabriel's cover is blown. He is dragged back to Israel, kicking and screaming all the way, because he wants his work to be art restoration, not killing on command. It soon becomes apparent that he has to take this job. Not only had a bomb blown up the embassy in Rome, but it appeared as though an old enemy of Gabriel's, one thought dead, was coming back to haunt him. Part of the problem was that I didn't like the reader. It took me a while to get used to the last reader so this one felt very off. His accents were not distinguishable enough and many times I didn't know who was talking.

I know that Silva's writing projects that the Israeli spy Allon and Israeli intelligence is almost and always the best in the world, which might feel bit stereotyped in all his novel, but then I don't read Allon series to debate over world politics. I read them because they are absolutely riveting, doesn't spare a dull moment and always keeps me at the edge of the seat and compels me to finish them otherwise I cannot rest. Add to that Silva's subject to the Israeli cause in each book gives it a very realistic backdrop for every novel he writes. The previous 3 novels were on the holocaust and Nazi Germany atrocities and how post WW2 Nazi Germans were being hunted down by Israeli intelligence. This one deals with more immediate problems in Israel, the Palestine terrorism. The book deals with how Allon's perfect life in Venice gets thrown away as his cover is blown by the terrorist cells in Palestine and he is forced to return to Israel. How he goes about finding the terrorists and bombers who are after him now. This book also deals with how he gets setup in the terrorist mastermind's plot of exposing him to the world that he was a Israeli ayyan, the assassin. But in the end, Allon is the winner and the hero wins against he villain. Easy plot? But then, Silva, the master of thriller, espionage, intelligence novels give this plot a brilliant spin and just keeps you glued to each page till you finish this.What made this book better is the way Allon handles his love life and decides between his wife and his lover! It makes you feel that no matter how iconic Allon is, he is but only a human and a Man and hence the women in his life gets the better of him.Onto my next Allon/Silva novel and keeping my fingers crossed about how he manages to win his personal battle in regards to the women in his life!"}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2211350-lori", "userReview": "The latest installment of the Gabriel Allon novels is great, perhaps the best to date. If you enjoy political intrigue, well rounded characters, suspense and good writing pick up a volume in this series by Daniel Silva. What makes these novels so good is the humanness that Silva injects into his characters. Though they find themselves in extraordinary circumstances you can relate to their very human feelings and actions. The small details are what make Gabriel such an interesting main character. His passion for art restoration, his feelings for his wife, his ambivalance at being an assassin and his ongoing search for who he is as a man only serve to invest the reader further. The plot itself was interesting in that it revolves around current tensions in the Middle East and terrorism.

It is a good balance of action, behind-the-scenes spy-exploits, and character development. Allon's character is fascinating, primarily with how he deals with the damage to his psyche that his job has had on him. I also like that while the book is clearly on the Israeli side of things, it doesn't shy away from telling the Palestinian side of the conflict. It doesn't cast all Arabs as evil and doesn't paint the Israelis as squeaky clean angels. It tries to capture the subtly and complexity of this ageless conflict. And yet, it doesn't descend into a kind moral relativism. The bad guys are bad and they get served justice. Mostly, though, there is just something about the world that Silva has created in these books that calls me back to it.

In Prince of Fire we find Allon in a bad situation, his cover as an art restorer is blown and he has to abandon the work that he loves in Venice. One of the things I love most about Silva's writing is that he manages to alternate illuminating, in-depth background passages with breathless, fast-paced sequences. I find this delicious to read because the variation in pace keeps the books intriguing. I often find non-stop action to be tiresome and lacking in depth or perspective and endless narrative gets tedious but Silva has a knack for hitting just the right combination to make his books both compulsively readable and educational.Prince of Fire deals with a variety of Middle Eastern issues which seem especially relevant today. Gabriel has to go back to Israel and his mission is fraught with complications but, of course, that's when Gabriel is at his best. This is a great read.

I felt like he was sketch the scenes, dotting them with bits of vivid colour.

Now that I've read Barry Eisler's John Rain books I just can't make myself slog through Gabriel's apathy. The only characters in the series that are interesting are secondary characters like the Pope and Julian Isherwood. The fact that ALL the Arabs(and most of the Eurpeans) are bad guys and ALL the Jews/Israelis are good guys wears on my sense of gray.
