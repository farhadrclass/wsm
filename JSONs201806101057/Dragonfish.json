He finds out that she has married a man named Sonny who has broken her arm causing her once again to flee. He always found Suzy and her strange ways, reactions and emotional disturbances, difficult to understand. He goes to Las Vegas to seek her out and offer his help. His chance for atonement and understanding.He finds more than he bargained for, but Suzy, this is not her Vietnamese name and her mysteries remain shrouded. A different kind of thriller, much action, the mystery of uncovering Suzy's past and some great characterizations. A glimpse into the seedier life of Las Vegas, it's casinos and its criminal enforcers. A more noirish, in your face style of book. I enjoyed this though, it was a change of pace from the normal run of serial killer thrillers. Maybe a bit like the late great Elmore Leonard type of no hold barred book.ARC from publisher."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "Apologies in advance to the author for what I am about to say, but this is just my opinion. The book didn\u2019t really work and the reasons are manifold. It had a strong start, partly because I misinterpreted the prose to indicate that the main character was a youngish Vietnamese-American cop. That seemed a completely fresh and unique angle on a crime novel or series, but it turned out the main character was in fact a white, middle-aged man, Robert Ruen, married to a Vietnamese immigrant, Ph\u1ea1m Th\u1ecb H\u1ed3ng. No matter how good the man\u2014he was a nice cop\u2014his doomed marriage to a woman who was not interested in him makes for a very uncomfortable reading experience.Bob didn\u2019t like the way Americans pronounced H\u1ed3ng\u2019s name so he encouraged her to take the name of his first girlfriend, Suzy. Really? I mean, really\u2026 Ewww. When Bob and Suzy make love, Bob notes she would \u201cwhimper, a child-like thing a lot of Asian women do\u2026\u201d Really? How the heck would Bob know? Have a thing for Asian women, Bob? Ewww.One major problem I encountered was the lack of a consistent viewpoint or a character I liked well enough to care about. The novel is written in first person, making Bob the central character. But then the huge swathes of H\u1ed3ng\u2019s diary are written in first person, making her the narrator. But really the center seemed to me to be a young male Vietnamese resident of Las Vegas, Victor. Victor seemed understanding enough and compassionate enough to lead us to the intention of the novel. Victor just came too late and too briefly (and at the same time too long, if that is even possible), over halfway through the novel. If the different viewpoints could have been brought in without monopolizing (and paralyzing) the narrative for too many pages - just give us bits of their thinking at a time. The author would have to trust us readers to be able to distinguish the character's individual viewpoints, at least that problem would be solved. Whose novel was this? If I had to guess, the story is H\u1ed3ng\u2019s: her path from Vietnam was traumatic. She became a \u201cbounder,\u201d a woman who scarpers, a woman who leaves husband and children, avoiding relationships. Frankly, with the folks she hitched up with, I would, too. The author showed us that, but I never really felt he was in on the irony--he was an insufficient advocate for a woman under duress. I guess the idea was that H\u1ed3ng continued to feel trauma since her coming to the States. I totally get that. The problem is that H\u1ed3ng\u2019s diary just wasn\u2019t enough to sustain our sympathy for her. We had her behaviors to deal with, and they were really unattractive. If she could only have said \"I don't know what to do,\" among all the other stuff in her diary which was written \nnot at all\n like someone's diary, I might have gotten there.On an ordinary day, I seek out non-white viewpoints in American literature for what it can teach me. What this taught me is that dreams and spirits are important and commonly-accepted parts of Vietnamese culture and individuals are given some leeway to accommodate spiritual things in their everyday lives. This is not completely unique: Latin cultures express it also, with differences.I also learned that there is a different character to the violence expressed in ordinary conflict that is outside the thuggish beatings and shootings Americans commonly experience with gang or domestic violence among whites or blacks. In this novel the quality of the violence is distinct: there is a kind of slick sadism that leaves one feeling queasy. Our man Bob was completely out of his element, which was the point, I guess. It was just hard for me to warm up to anyone. Two stars for getting this published. Chris Abani\u2019s graceful review of this title in the NYTimes is worth reading, as is most everything Abani writes."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "A Strobing, Suspenseful, Genre-Elusive Literary Novel Brash | Tense | TenderThe DragonfishThis short genre-defying novel wowed me with suspenseful symmetry in following Robert, a mulish Oakland cop with a vigilante streak, as he searches for his ex-wife who's disappeared from her current husband, a Vietnamese mob boss in Las Vegas who raises dragonfish* for fun. \nDragonfish's\n cadence, in mixing thrilling present-day narrative with intriguing back story of a down-and-out cop and his Vietnam War refugee ex-wife, rises as a radiant spectre out of the phosphorescence in the mystery, noir, literary and thriller genres.Rear Admiral Guff"}, {"userName": "Joseph", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9479701-joseph", "userReview": "Okay, so this cop is in love with this chick he was married to.

Why? 1. Production editors: Please quit placing huge blocks of text--and especially WHOLE CHAPTERS--in italics. They are hard to read (b looks like h, for starters) and readers tend to skim them. I am no exception. 2. Bob/Robert's insistence in calling Hong Suzy. This drove me mad--it wasn't her name--and then other characters were doing it, too. Was that intentional (why?) or an error? Sonny and his son would never have called her Suzy and I doubt that Happy would have either. I do believe that his calling her Suzy had some deep-routed meaning--a desire to make the other more familiar and all of that and an exploration of that theme could have been interesting. Instead, it was like a hangnail to me--something irritating that I was constantly being reminded of. 3. Paper quality is crap. Maybe that is no big deal in the grand scheme of things but this is a title I would love to gift to people but as a $27 hardcover, there isn't a chance of that happening. Maybe when it is out in paperback, but Norton don't insult readers or the author by using lousy, toothy paper. Let's play BUY, BORROW, PASS on this one.

That sort of describes the novel. For me, what is notable is the story of damaged Vietnamese refugees along with the ugly underbelly that runs Las Vegas. This noir type novel leaves the reader feeling the bleakness and hopelessness of not only Las Vegas, but of the life of refugees who are haunted by their past.Vu Tran\u2019s writing is extraordinary. I\u2019m surprised at the lack of press on this novel. Perhaps it\u2019s because it came out in summer and this isn\u2019t a beach read. The author\u2019s use of dark similes and metaphors makes this a slow read, one to be noticed. Because of this, the novel started out slow for me and it took me a bit to slow down.

Luckily a friend passed along her galley and I finally sat down to read it this week, only to kick myself for waiting so long. I love neo-Noir and Dragonfish is absolutely Noir in the classic sense. There is a tortured good guy who's not really that good. There is a gangster nemesis. There is a mysterious woman. There is no happy ending and no tidy solutions. But Tran uses the Noir style and structure to tell the story of an immigrant's pain, loss, and identity (or lack thereof). While Robert the cop is the narrator of the book, it is Suzy, his Vietnamese ex-wife, who is its center. Tran makes an interesting choice of revealing Suzy's history through a series of letters to the reader so that you know much more than Robert does about several of the characters. Even if this detracts a little from understanding just how lost and confused Robert is, it's incredibly valuable to root the story more firmly in Suzy's voice and experience, to show just how futile the men who orbit around her trying to save her are. It's also full of plot twists and betrayals, a very satisfying and quick read."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1478144-john", "userReview": "A couple of years ago, Hong -- or Suzy, as he called her -- the wife of Oakland, California, cop Robert Ruen, walked out on him after he'd hit her. Later, following their divorce, she reappeared as the wife of a Las Vegas gambler and crook, Sonny, who Robert learned was maltreating her. An attempt by him to \"persuade\" Sonny to change his ways was an abject failure. Now, though, Sonny is blackmailing him into returning to Vegas and tracking down Hong, who has made herself scarce from a second marriage . . .At one level this is a superb, helterskelter thriller: I raced through it in a couple of days, and was completely satisfied by the time I turned its final page, even though its ending is ambiguous. But I suspect it's going to hang around in my mind long after most thrillers would have been forgotten, because it presents not the account of the Vietnamese refugee experience in America that I'd been expecting but a portrait of an American failing -- if he even genuinely tries -- to come to terms with the world of the Vietnamese immigrants, and in particular with the Vietnamese immigrant to whom he was married for eight years.Most of the narrative is related in the first person by Robert, who clearly believes himself to be one of the good guys; as we get to know him better we realize that, while his self-image is somewhat over-flattering, he's not actually a bad guy -- just an unimaginative one. The other main (although far lesser) narrator of the tale is Hong herself: we're treated to her accounts of how she survived, with her small daughter, the trip from Vietnam to the US via a refugee camp in Malaysia. Although these latter lack the element of engrossing mystery present in the main narrative, they're fascinating and moving in their own right.There are no true heroes in Dragonfish, just flawed people who are or are not doing their best to muddle through in as honorable a way as they can. In that sense the novel refreshingly reflects real life.I do have a couple of very minor quibbles about the book (I loathe the verb \"to ash,\" as in \"he ashed his cigarette into an ashtray,\" and I could have done without the use of italics for protracted sections of text), but overall it has nothing but my profound admiration: engaging and thought-provoking, it's one of the best and most enjoyable thrillers I've read in a while."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23315273-carol", "userReview": "I so wanted to like Dragonfish. Tran's writing is beautiful. As a novel, however, Dragonfish doesn't work. It has no momentum. Despite violent acts described multiple times throughout the book, I never cared enough about any of its multiple characters to feel any suspense about whether one of them would be harmed. Our protagonist, Bob, and another character, Mai, seem to exist only for the purpose of communicating the story of Bob's missing ex-wife, \"Suzy\" - the character Tran cares about. Mai - a daughter ditched by Suzy without explanation as a girl - expresses zero emotions and no conflicting feelings about her mother. Mai and Bob don't have the initial sizing-each-other-up conversation that would have happened if these characters mattered to the author. Suzy takes form through other characters' recollections of her actions and also through several letters, but still never seems to be real or authentic. We are told that Bob is a veteran police officer, yet he displays none of a veteran police officer's instincts or thought processes. He's a character you keep wanting to yell, \"No, no, don't go into that room!!\"Unfortunately, at the end of the day, Dragonfish seems like the work of an author who has participated in many writers' workshops and might have an MFA - he has perfected the craft of sentence structure, but what he lacks is a story he must tell or characters into which he has the ability to breathe life."}, {"userName": "Amy Vaterlaus", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16465049-amy-vaterlaus", "userReview": "This was a hard one to rate because I was really looking forward to this book based off the summary and I was really disappointed.

I understand the traumatic experience that Suzy had to go through which makes her such an unstable character, but it also doesn't mean you make all the characters and story line that way too.

On the one hand, I think it was well written in that the story moves along and made me want to move along with it. I was pulling the book out on the bus and plane to find out what happens next. So it was good for that. But there were other problems for me:1) The plot itself is kind of weird. I can\u2019t figure out why Suzy does what she does\u2014all her scheming makes no sense to me. Some of it is realistic but a lot of it is just weird.2) The characterization is reallly off. I like that there were attempts to develop a lot of prominent characters and I appreciate that the author made a strong attempt to do so, but it felt very forced to me. The narrator and protagonist, Robert, is somewhat erratic. I almost like him, but then he does some completely un-likeable things and it is hard to recover, as a reader, from that. Suzy\u2019s character is completely erratic and I found myself not liking her at all, despite the attempt by the author to \u201ctell her story\u201d from her POV with the journal. The disconnect between the \u201ctragic\" widowed Suzy and everything that Suzy does from the island to the present day is too great. She is a chaotic character, one that evokes no sympathy from me whatsoever. The other major characters\u2014Junior, Sonny, Happy\u2014there are some redeeming values for them but even Happy, who I had liked initially, becomes unlikeable. Victor and Mai are less developed, flat characters, and sadly, they are the only likeable characters. This is why I am conflicted about this book. There are some good elements but overall, I felt dissatisfied. The ending was not satisfying and I could not find one character to root for.

There are two running stories at once, past and present: one of a woman explaining her immigration from Vietnam through a series of letters, and the other is Robert, a cop obsessed with his ex-wife Suzy. He\u2019s obsessed enough to drive to Vegas to threaten her current husband, but nothing goes as planned and soon the reader is plunged into the dark world these characters navigate in. The exploration of Suzy through the eyes of the men in her life who never quite understand her is one of those things I\u2019ve been unable to shake since reading this novel.--from Book Riot's Unusual Suspects newsletter: http://link.bookriot.com/view/56a8200..."}], "description": "Vu Tran has written a thrilling and cinematic work of sophisticated suspense and haunting lyricism set in motion by characters who can neither trust each other nor themselves. Dragonfish is a remarkable debut, a noir page-turner. Robert's ex-wife has disappeared and her new husband is blackmailing Robert into finding her for him. His search leads him to learn more about his ex-wife than he ever did in their marriage. As Robert starts illuminating the dark corners of her life, the legacy of her sins threatens to immolate them all.", "title": "Dragonfish", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30064557-dragonfish", "average": 3.23, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1462061196l/30064557.jpg", "reviews": 334, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/144563.Vu_Tran", "name": "Vu Tran"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Thriller", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30064557-dragonfish", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23316485-dragonfish", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26530360-dragonfish", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24823489-dragonfish", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26221991-dragonfish", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28647687-christmas-pageant", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27270823-the-sacrament-of-baptism", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26794991-preaching-the-word", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2347193.Las_Vegas_Noir", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8150241-dead-neon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
