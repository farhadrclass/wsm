I actually liked it quite a bit. Ed Lorn has asked his friends on this site to not rate his books because he doesn't want readers to think he is gaming the system. He did not send me a pm wanting me to either review or buy his book. He did not send me a friend request promoting his book. I think I actually was the one that stalked err friend requested him. So that's the truth..suck it up buttercup.I knew not to read this book while there was a chance of snow in our forecast because Ed's writing has a way of sneaking out of my little mind at bad times and scaring the crap out of me. It might be months later but he will get me every stinking time.Things I learned from this book:Frying pans are multi-use items. I'm going to buy stock in them.\nEverybody should have listened to Bugs Bunny and his luck when he takes a wrong turn at Albuquerque.\nAnd a question I'm wondering about also is:\"Are those its nails? How's it pick it's nose?\""}, {"userName": "Char", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6581119-char", "userReview": "4.5 stars!An original twist on the \"stuck on the road\" premise.

She is thrilled to spot a nearby trailer. After all, she can find shelter therein and get some help...right? But then Bugs Bunny shows up. Well, not Bugs, exactly, but something peculiar that reminds Kay of the way the cartoon rabbit tunnels through the ground. \nSomething sinister lurks beyond the trail leading to the trailer. But I'm not going to tell you what....As always, Edward Lorn has created a highly imaginative, gripping tale of suspense. I typically don't enjoy short stories as much, but Lorn's brilliant writing and storytelling delivers quite a punch. My only complaint is that curiosity got the best of me and I would have liked to know more about the origin of the Bugs Bunny imposters....Okay, I'll say no more."}, {"userName": "Andrew Lennon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6115193-andrew-lennon", "userReview": "I first came across Ed Lorn when I saw his freeby \"The Naughty List\" on promotion over Christmas. I'm not one to turn down free stuff so I grabbed it up and I really enjoyed it. From then I have seen several comments on here for friends about Ed's books, all positive. And I really enjoy his reviews on Stephen Kings books!So when I saw that he had a new book coming out and that it was only 20 pages I thought I'd have a little break from what I'm reading and check this out.I'm certainly glad I did! This is a great short story, it gives just enough detail to make you wince, but not so much that it's ruined.Thoroughly enjoyed this and I'll definitely be checking out more from Mr Lorn.Good read, check it out.All reviews can be found at http://lennonslair.blogspot.co.uk"}, {"userName": "mark monday", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131922-mark-monday", "userReview": "Short, sharp, vivid, visceral. Featuring horrible snarling biting clawing flying tunneling supernatural snow wolf creatures with bright green blood, like something out of a nightmare version of some children's cartoon. Lorn can certainly set a scene and then make it pop. Bonus points for having a strong mom character. Extra bonus points for having said mom character bash the brains out of her abusive husband before the story even starts."}, {"userName": "Michael Hicks", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6409681-michael-hicks", "userReview": "TRAILER is a brisk and entertaining read, and a heck of a lot of fun. Edward Lorn plunks you right into the thick of things immediately, and his descriptions of battered-wife Kay's tribulations are spot on. Caught in a snow storm and on the run with her son after murdering her abusive husband, the two seek shelter in an abandoned trailer and get more than they bargain for. The prose is fast-paced and the descriptions are lean and mean, with some truly terrific turns of phrase. I'm a sucker for snow-set survival stories, and the environment becomes a legit other-worldly threat in Lorn's hands. Good stuff!"}, {"userName": "Mel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2030264-mel", "userReview": "This was a very short story and a very fast read. I don't want to say too much because it will just ruin the story. I will say, there is a reason they tell you not to go driving around when there is a bad snow storm.

Edward Lorn, so far you have not disappointed."}, {"userName": "Laura Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7491783-laura-thomas", "userReview": "Edward Lorn is a master of the short horror story. This one is no exception.It\u2019s not fit for man nor beast with a nor\u2019easter raging outside, but Kay has no choice. She left her husband lying in a pool of blood, the frying pan she used to kill him sticking out of his face. Bullying her was one thing, but abusing her son, Tony, a boy with Down Syndrome, was not to be tolerated.Now, on the road in the middle of the night in a blinding snow storm, Kay must find shelter from the storm when the car breaks down.Her son had spotted a mailbox a ways back so they find it and follow a narrow path through the trees to a decrepit trailer.But, before they can get to it, something rises from the snow. Something white, with glowing silver eyes and very sharp teeth and claws. Soon. more rise out of the snow and it\u2019s a race to get to the trailer.But will the trailer be protection from the screeching beasts outside?Well, you know I can\u2019t answer that question.I\u2019ll tell you this though. The beasts are determined to get inside and eat them up and the trailer has been long abandoned and falling apart.The best thing about Edward\u2019s short stories is his characters. He has this ability to flesh them out quickly. You feel you know them. But don\u2019t get too attached to them. He\u2019s not above knocking them off for a good scene.Must not forget his creatures. They are all uniquely his own creations and bloody nasty too."}, {"userName": "Brainycat", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3807871-brainycat", "userReview": "Brainycat's 5 \"B\"s :blood: 4boobs: 0bombs: 2bondage: 2blasphemy: 1 Stars : 3 Bechdel Test : PASS Deggan's Rule : FAIL Gay Bechdel Test : FAILFull review at booklikes."}, {"userName": "Scot", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/912721-scot", "userReview": "(Review) Trailer \u00a0Another nightmare from the mind of Edward Lorn.
