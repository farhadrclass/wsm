While I felt the idea of the novel was a creative one - and unlike other angel/demon books I have read in the past, I felt the overall development of the plot was rushed and sketchy at times, for lack of a better word. The connection between the two main characters lacked merit and believability as well..., I mean, come on now - you find out your boyfriend of two days is a minion of the devil and your reaction is \"so what?\" lolThe relationship between lux and lily was also rushed and lacked any real spark. I never enjoy novels where the love interests are making out and declaring their love within the first 10% of the book. I have no doubt that this book will fare well for those who enjoy the genre. Even though I didn't like this book, it won't stop me from buying amanda's next releases. :)"}, {"userName": "Joey Butcher", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4887505-joey-butcher", "userReview": "I was beyond excited when I heard Amanda Hocking was coming out with a new book. When she said that she had posted it to Amazon, I was checking my phone and my Kindle every half hour to see if the book had uploaded yet. But after I began reading the book, I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The idea for the plot was fantastic! How she had selected people being a certain virtue, the idea of finding your opposite (such as lust and purity falling in love) and the classic idea of good and evil fighting for victory was brought about in an all new way. But the way she went about writing everything was just something I wasn\u2019t a fan of. The characters weren\u2019t personal, a bit too much insta-love and oblivious characters that made the story difficult to believe and get into- yes, even for a faerie tale.For me, the book was difficult to finish reading, and the ending wasn\u2019t one that had me excited that I forced myself through it. But I could see the book being great for a young teen audience vs. the young adult world.To see more of my reviews please visit: ink-puddle.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Issa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4840348-issa", "userReview": "I read this book in one sitting.

A LOT differently. While I enjoyed this story and read through it quickly, there were several things that bothered me about it. The most glaring of these things is the overwhelming about of \"telling v showing\" that occurs throughout the book. As one of my favorite writing professors always said: \"Don't tell me the woman walked across the street. Show it to me!\" One of these such lines is \"For a moment, he was stuck completely mute by her beauty, and that response to her started him.\"SHOW ME HE WAS STARTLED! How did he show he was startled? Did he stare at her with wide eyes? Did he stumble a bit? Catch his breath? I want to know how strongly Lux reacted to Lily's beauty rather than having the author use something so unemotional as \"and that response to her startled him.\" How am I as a reader supposed to connect to Lux's emotion otherwise?I could keep listing instances of this, but I think I'll just leave it at that. The number of typos and such throughout the text were also bothersome, though not so much as the telling. The characters were stock. Lily and Lux felt flat rather than fully rounded, and I didn't relate to their struggle at all. Wick was a bit more rounded in her desire to help and rescue Lily in memory of an old friend (Lily's mother), as was Gula in his readiness to help Lux regardless of what may happen to him in the end. Valefor, however, was a stock villian, as were his minions. I DID like the concept of the Sins and their opposite Virtues, but it wasn't expanded or developed enough to really excite me.All in all, I'd recommend someone who was interested in a good read, but it's definitely not for someone who is always on the lookout for good literature."}, {"userName": "Everly Anders", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5338552-everly-anders", "userReview": "What works about this book is Amanda\u2019s never failing imagination. She always comes up with wonderful and creative worlds. I appreciate how original the idea for this was. I also liked the ancillary characters. I thought the lead male character, lux worked as well. I think the reason everyone keeps saying this would be good for a younger audience is because a younger audience does not need the romantic relationship to be realistic. The bottom line is that it does not work. The main characters fall in love in the first few pages and you don\u2019t understand why. Then they have only a few conversations and then decided they would go to hell and back for each other. That does not work either. This surprised me because the author has done a really good job in past books with relationships. The other thing that does not work is the main female character. In the beginning she is this dainty, innocent little thing, who then later jumps on a demons backs and attacks them. Her character is just not that believable.\tBottom line is, if you like Amanda Hocking\u2019s books then get it and you will be entertained but if this is your first time reading her, try one of her other books."}, {"userName": "neptune", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24045766-neptune", "userReview": "nice and neat.   all because of this series  (the trylle) i started readin amanda hocking booksi soon fell in love with it and bought the first book of the watersong series and it was OK. soon came my blood approves and voil\u00e0 disappointment ( its wayyyyy toooooo much lke twilight). virtue wont disappoint you much as i mentioned its simple nice and neat.eagerly waiting to buy kaninn chronicles"}, {"userName": "Laura's Book Addiction", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3551390-laura-s-book-addiction", "userReview": "I can't beleive that i'm about to say this about a book written by Amanda Hocking who happens to be one of my all time favourite authors but I really didn't like Virtue at all the permise sounded so good and I really liked the start where Lily and Lux meet but something with Virtue just didn't feel at all right I made myself keep reading just to see if it got an better it didn't and I had to give up at 64% I really am so sorry that I couln't get into it."}, {"userName": "Caro", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2344161-caro", "userReview": "I guess Virtue was okay.The love story about Lux and Lily was predictible, shallow and boring.

In case you're just looking for a light romance, well, skip this. The so-called love between the protagonists is forced and unbelievable.And the author's writing style has the simplicity of a 5-year-old's speech.

I usually devour Amanda Hocking's books (I especially love the Hollowland series) but for some reason could never really fully get into this one. I mentally roll my eyes when the main couple meet at the beginning of a book and the first thing they do is inexplicably kiss because they're so attracted to each other. I love a good paranormal/sci-fi young adult book as much as the next person, but when this happens I immediately wonder what is going on. I like the characters to actually have a reason to like each other, not just to be \"drawn together\" within 3 seconds of meeting without knowing a thing about each other. It just isn't feasible to me, and so the book is starting with a major strike against it before we're halfway through the first chapter. Unfortunately, as the book went on and this unfounded bond between the main couple continues (still with no basis to it as far as I can see), I found it harder and harder to keep reading.

It's not that I don't love her ideas or stories, they are VERY, VERY good! She writes good stories, but sometimes something always just ruins it. Either it's the main character, sometimes it's the pacing, or lack of development of the characters in the story. Virtue's this one stand alone, fantasy novel is that it's too short and has tons of grammatical errors and some sentences that won't make sense. But despite all of that, some of what Virtue can offer can be quite entertaining. IF, you can slack off and just go with the narration and flow with the story.The story is simple, long time ago good and evil fought over dominance and control over the earth. None of the sides ever won, so in order to solve this predicament they decided to use humans to finally put an end to this ridiculous fight. Millenniums later, Lux a young man is sent by his master to retrieve a mysterious package from Lord Gabriel's castle. However what he doesn't know is that the so called package is actually the lord's daughter, Lilly. Can Lux take Lilly to his master exactly as he was told, or will he succumb to the beautiful and innocent young girl, Lilly?Nothing special here to be honest, except the clever use of the idea Hocking use this time around. The fairy tail fantasy world colliding with the idea of the seven deadly sins and their counterpart the virtues as the forces of good and evil determining the fate of the world and mankind is exquisite. I honestly like the idea, and the gits and info on the lore itself. However just as I said, the book is to short and just not work as one stand alone novel. Hack the characters themselves are only one dimensional with no real depth except from one supporting character! The main characters themselves are pretty weak to be honest. Sure, Lux does seems interesting but Lilly little romance thing with him kinda ruins it to me. I just wish Hocking wrote this as a series rather then one novel.Speaking of writing, when it comes to writing, all Amanda Hocking's books are evolutionary as a new one comes around. You can really see the progress she had made ever since her first debut to her other works. She's defiantly better suited to writing in first person view then third person view as you can tell how little she can get us to feel or be surprise or sad for the characters. Fortunately one of Hocking aspects never fail no matter what choice of writing she decides to use and that's the fighting and action sequences, which are my favorite~Overall, Virtue has good ideas, good established world but little to offer. It suffered from short and rush ending, weak main characters, bad writing and not that much threating villains, except for Ira o.o But nevertheless, if you looking for a short and easy read go for it. Nothing to lose. You can finish it less then 3-4 hours top."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3945821-jennifer", "userReview": "I had been really excited for this book to come out and bought it that day with plans to read it after I was done with what I was currently reading. In the mean time I had read some reviews and it gave me mixed feelings about reading it. Of course I would eventually. Needing a break from all the murder and horror books I have been reading, I went ahead and gave it a chance. Virtue is, as the author describes it, a fairy tale. The balance of good vs evil is on the brink of being upset, with evil coming out the victor, and one unknowing young girl in the center. Lux has been sent by his master, Valefor, to basically kidnap Lily, with intentions to make her his bride so that evil will take over the world. As with most fairy tales, it was pretty much love at first sight. Instead of Lux taking her back to Valefor, he drops her off in a spooky forest and tells her to never go back to the palace she lived in. As with most if not all fairy tales, good triumphs over evil. There were a lot of interesting characters throughout. Was this Amanda Hocking best book? Not by any means but the story line is light and fun. There were plenty of \"what happens next\" parts and surprises. I was definitely entertained with this story. The reason I gave it 3 stars was because there were quite a few grammatical errors and places where words were missing or should have been deleted and weren't. I understand that she is a self-published author but I have also read many other books by self-published authors that had fewer errors. Was it enough to distract me from the story or make it un-enjoyable? No way! But I felt I couldn't really give it any more than that. I have yet to read anything by Amanda Hocking that I have disliked or couldn't finish. Once I started, I was drawn in to the magical world she had created. Amanda Hocking will always remain one of my favorite authors and I will continue to read anything she puts out there."}, {"userName": "Paranormal_Madness", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17012067-paranormal-madness", "userReview": "What I liked:-Wick. She was the only character in the book I really liked, and the only character I was really able to get a feeling for. I understood her dedication to Lily more than I did Lux\u2019s dedication, and I think that made her my favorite character.-Fairytale setting. I liked the unique little bits added to this world. The sea dragon was a nice touch, as was the river full of fish that lure their victims in by crying like babies. That was super creative and it gave the setting a more mystical feeling.What I disliked:-Writing style. The writing in this book was very, very bland. I\u2019ve noticed that Amanda Hocking\u2019s third person storytelling abilities are not as good as her first person. When she writes in third person, it all seems very impersonal and I can\u2019t get into the story as much. There isn\u2019t as much emotion in what her characters do.-Plot. There didn\u2019t seem to be much of a plot, other than Lux having to rescue Lily.-Romance. This book had a terrible case of insta-love that drove me nuts. There was absolutely nothing about Lux and Lily\u2019s relationship that made me think they were in love with one another. They pretty much locked eyes and fell in love with one another, and that always makes me roll my eyes. Without a strong sense of love for one another, everything Lux does to get Lily back just seems over the top and overly dramatic and kind of stupid. The romance could have been done better.Overall, this was a pretty disappointing book. I\u2019m a fan of Amanda Hocking, but this was definitely not her best work. It was very short, very boring, and the writing wasn\u2019t good. I would only recommend this book for diehard fans of hers. 1.5"}, {"userName": "Shanella", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1722347-shanella", "userReview": "Virtue - A Fairy Tale, is one of Amanda Hocking\u2019s self-published endeavors. As I found with all her books, this is a different and interesting story. It\u2019s a battle between good and evil and Lily, unaware of the part she plays in this battle, is kidnapped by Valefor (the ruler of the evil side) who attempts to woo her over to his side (though the paths he tries to take are unconventional). Throw in a bit of magic and you\u2019ve got an interesting tale. It took me a very long time to read this book. It wasn\u2019t that the story wasn\u2019t pleasant, it was, and I found it to be very intriguing, but, there was something about the writing that made it drag. I\u2019ve always experienced this while reading Amanda\u2019s books, and I\u2019ve finally figured out the reason. Virtue would be a good story to read out loud, it reads more like a campfire story than a novel. There are these awkward parts of the story as though someone is telling the tale and forgot to add a piece in, so they decide to stick it in after the fact - e.g. in a fight scene, Lux tells Lily and Wick to get away, then he follows them, but to let the reader know that he knew where Lilly and Wick were going, there is a piece added in that Lux saw them going the wrong way but didn\u2019t have time to stop and tell them. This was suppose to allow the reader to believe that Lux knew where to find Lily and Wick, but Lux could have just shouted \u201cwrong way\u201d to save the ladies (and himself) the trouble.It\u2019s little things like this - and I know I\u2019m nitpicking - but these things pull me out of the story and while I like the idea behind it, unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t love the story."}, {"userName": "Marsha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1991207-marsha", "userReview": "I truly enjoy reading books by Amanda Hocking and \"Virtue\" is no exception. Ms. Hocking describes this book as a fairy tale and that is truly an accurate description.Virtue is a story about good vs. evil. In this world God made the earth and has agreed to a contest of sorts with the devil. Each side will battle it out to determine who ultimately will obtain control of this dominion. Humans and demons are the pons in this game. Lily's father and stepmother are hosting an anniversary party at their kingdom. She is shy and unassuming. Little does she know that her stepmother has hired someone(Lux) to kidnap her and take her to the vilest villain around, Valefor.Lux is a demon whose power is lust. However, never in his wildest dreams did he believe that he would fall pry to the innocence of Lily. Upon meeting her at the ball, he entices her away not realizing that he would not be able to turn her over to Valefor. Lux has a decision to make; so, he decides to drop her off in an cursed forest for safety? This is where the story truly becomes interesting.Virtue is filled with magical creatures, demons who represent the worse in all of us ( Rage, gluttony, Lust etc.), hellhounds, ogres and others. I enjoyed the world that Hocking created. World building and characterizations are one of her strengths. I only gave this book 3 stars because there just wasn't enough of the story for me to truly give it 5 stars. The story did not feel rush; but, it just did not satisfy me the way Hocking's other stories do. Do not let this stop you from reading the book though.

The story drew me in and developed a fantasical world were imaginative creatures leap off the page. The story opens following Lux who is a mysterious man on a mission for an unknown creepy boss. Lilly is the Lord's daughter who stumbles upon Lux in the garden and is immediately drawn to him. They share a moment until Lily runs off and Lux is taken into the stepmother's secret room where she practices witchcraft. The stepmother wants Lux to take Lily to his boss. Lux immediately recoils at the idea of taking the breathtaking Lily to his evil boss but knows if he refuses someone else worse will be sent to do the task. So Lux persuades Lily to run off with him and then leaves her in the necrosilvam which is a dead magical wood that dark creatures live in. However, the magic of the place will mask Lily's location if the witch or Lux's boss Valefor try to find her. There is so much to this story I could write forever. Lux essentially has to try and save Lily from his boss who manages to steal her away at a certain point. There is a certain battle between good and evil. Peccati are minions of demons that represent the seven deadly sins. Irin are their good counterparts which represnt the seven virtues. Irin are born and peccati are basically made.

So, I bought Virtue by Amanda Hocking to read. I had heard it was a quick little read that was very enjoyable and as I've said before, (and maybe even gotten a little preachy on the subject) I love Amanda Hocking's work. This book follows the story of Lux and Lily. Lux must steal Lily from her castle home for his master, even though he has no idea why. He goes to a ball where she will be and lures her out of the ballroom and outside with him. After falling for Lily's innocence and loving nature, he lets her escape into the dreaded woods that surrounds their castles land. After this one defining moment, Lily and Lux must decide what is right and the difference between good and evil.While this book may not have been Hocking\u2019s best, I still finished it in a matter of an hour and a half and really enjoyed it. I felt it was directed towards a younger audience but the story of good versus evil and two people\u2019s struggle with destiny hook you in. As in some of Hockings earlier self-published novels, there are some typos and little technical errors.

Each of the irin and the daemon were allowed seven minions to help them on their conquests of the earth. Irin's minions were called 'virtus' and daemon's were called 'pecatti'. For every virtu there is an equal and opposite daemon minion. Lily is actually a virtue, a castimonia, means chastity. While Lux is a pecatti, which stand for luxuria, a complete opposite of her..

He risked everything in his life; battle goblins, demon dogs, giant fish, sea dragons, and other magical creatures in order to save Lily, the one he couldn't imagined existing without.Honestly, this book was below my expectation. The story has a slow pace at the beginning and kinda rushed at the end, so I just felt the ending was still lacking. I thought it's better if there's more depth in character development.

Now with the negatives. The characters were poorly developed. The only character that had an inkling of a background was Lux. The beginning was so stupid, it almost made me want to drop the book. I mean, seriously,? In the period of half an hour, the author made the hero meet the herione, kiss her & almost fall in love with her. SERIOUSLY? Also, you can't grasp the time line of the story. Gowns, balls, horses & carriages are mentioned. However, they way the characters behave & talk doesn't suit all the previously mentioned. They live & dress like people did in the old times but they talk like people do nowadays. That just made me confused & I wasn't able the picture what was happening in the book accurately. Even though the idea of having the seven sins & virtues walk on earth was a very good & interesting one, the book was written in such a poor way that it ruined the idea."}, {"userName": "TheReadingKnitter/ Kasey", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1070966-thereadingknitter-kasey", "userReview": "In a world filled with magic, love might be the final answer in the eternal battle between good and evil. When Lux is tasked with retrieving the virtuous Lily for his master, his entire world is put in jeopardy. Lux must battle goblins, demon dogs, and sea dragons to rescue the one he loves, and that's only the beginning of what he must face...Virtue is a fairy tale for young adults with action, suspense, and romance. It contains mild language and some suggestive dialogue. Recommended ages 14 and up.My Review - This book was pretty good. It started out slow for me because I didn't know what was going on really. But the more I got into it the more I couldn't put it down. I love how easy Hocking's books are to read. And how once you read one of her books you want to read them all, right away! Wick was one of my favorite characters and Gula. It was another great read from Hocking, not my favorite but it was well worth paying for and reading! Can't wait to see what she comes out with next! Overall, I give it a 4 star!"}, {"userName": "Heidi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5422583-heidi", "userReview": "I honestly hated writing a review for this book. Although, I find no major flaw with Virtue, I really didn't feel the attachment that I normally do with Amanda Hocking's books. Perhaps, blame can be placed on myself. Ever since I heard that Virtue was being released, I have anxiously been awaiting my opportunity to read it. It is possible that my hopes were too high. Also, this book, to my knowledge, is not apart of a series or trilogy like the other books I have read of Amanda Hocking's which could explain the lack of connection I had with Lily. I would recommend this book for anyone in the mood for an easy read. I feel like the story line was well planned but the romantic plot lacked emotional intrigue. I did enjoy the fantastic and mythological creatures and the twist of good vs. evil. My overall critique would be that Virtue is a book that you will devour but if you are looking for an indepth tale filled with twists and uncertainties like the Trylle Trilogy or My Blood Approves series, you will find this tale somewhat lacking in those areas."}, {"userName": "Dani", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4763968-dani", "userReview": "Fun, fast read about a girl with a destiny, a boy with a secret and a world whose fate hangs in the balance as the eternal battle between good and evil rages on. \"Virtue\" seems to be written for a slightly younger audience than any of Hocking's previous books and departs somewhat from her contemporary paranormal usual as this is a more of a fairytale fantasy. In it she has crafted an interesting mythology regarding the balance of good and evil.There was definitely some insta-romance going on in this book, but I guess this is somewhat on par with most fairytales. Also, I wish that parts of the story didn't seem so rushed and that there had been a bit more character development. That being said, I did like Lily, the main character; she was sweet, a bit reserved and a little naive but when the situation required it she was strong and fought for those she loved.Overall, an entertaining read. 3.5/5 stars (rounded up for the star rating)"}], "description": "In a world filled with magic, love might be the final answer in the eternal battle between good and evil.
