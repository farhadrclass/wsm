If you know what \"Ah\" and \"doesnay\" mean and you don't mind the \"c-word\" AND you can handle reading about the slaughtering of chickens, this book is rather amusing. A review from Naill Griffiths (Wreckage and Stump): Fresh moves with all the terrifying inexorability of a factory conveyor belt. It is funny, moving gripping, magical, and tragic. A brilliant debut.Final Review: this is the weirdest book. I found it neither funny nor moving nor magical nor gripping. Tragic, maybe. There was a LOT more chicken slaughtering than I was anticipating. Beware!"}, {"userName": "Woody Chandler", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1026784-woody-chandler", "userReview": "It was a quick read with a LOT of Scottish dialect, akin to Irvine Welsh's novels. In fact, it was recommended to me on the strength of my being an Irvine Welsh fan. More tales of woe from the lower class, but that's the way it is. Like I said, a quick, compelling read."}, {"userName": "Glenn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122194-glenn", "userReview": "Mark McNay's debut novel, \u201cFresh,\u201d is a dark, violent, frequently hilarious book, one where the reader is delighted to feel a little out of sync, slightly off-kilter. Using the working-class Scottish dialect throughout \u201cFresh,\u201d Mark places his characters firmly in their physical space--whether that be the town of Royston, the Fresh Chicken factory floor, or the family room, where relations poke and rag each other, the way families do, not entirely without judgment, not entirely without affection--but after a few pages, the language becomes second nature to the reader, part of the joy of the book, as the characters quickly emerge, and you get swept up in the story.There's a remarkably tangible sense of our surroundings in \u201cFresh.\u201d After a few dozen pages, as the characters light smoke after smoke, we can almost see the tobacco haze in the air. A simple act like Sean and Albert cleaning the conveyor after a day's work at the chicken factory, brings lurid sights and stinging smells to our senses. An extended fantasia about a Norman Rockwell-esque family dinner ends with a breathtaking shock. Mark writes with telling detail about the town and the people who live there; the muddy streets, the bitter cold, the ambiance of the pub, the living room or kitchen where genuine warmth has been shared, shocking violence perpetrated.There are several sections in \u201cFresh\u201d where, writing of Sean's fantasy daydreams of a better life, or in creating an analogy that reflects his circumstances, like the lion hunting the gazelle near the end of the book, Mark finds a way to take us out of the story to draw us further in, almost like a predator maneuvering its prey far from safety. It' a wonderful display of a true artist's control of his craft.In \u201cFresh,\u201d we get a truly monstrous villain in Sean's brother Archie; from the same background, subject to the same influences as Sean, yet already slid down the black hole that Sean is desperately trying to avoid. Archie carries a sense of menace with him, a shiver-making premonition of danger to come throughout the book. The scene where he metes out his idea of justice upon a man who has been with his girl Lizzie while he was locked up is one of the most brutal scenes I've read; both for the act perpetrated, and the utter calm and cool with which Archie carries out the punishment. When he is in the scene, all else stills, and he demands our attention, like every character who meets Archie's fury, and has it change their lives, not for the better. Mark expertly illustrates the differences between predator and prey; and how, in an environment of privation and want, one must be able to avoid being the latter, even if one is not at all inclined to be the former.Mark McNay writes with tenderness and empathy for the plight of the people in the story, especially Sean O'Grady, our protagonist, whose circumstances make us to cringe at the situations he helps bring upon himself. Even as Mark has us view Sean with sympathy, he never lets him off the hook for the decisions he makes. We see what his actions will bring about, and still\u2026onward he plunges. Mark McNay has the ability to move and horrify, entertain and engage, giving us the full spectrum of emotions, all sometimes in bewilderingly close proximity to the other."}, {"userName": "Justin Matott", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1164912-justin-matott", "userReview": "REVIEW I DID FOR THE ROCKY MTN NEWSAuthor's background: McNay was raised in a mining village in central Scotland. After a failed electrical engineering course and 15 years doing odd jobs, he graduated from a creative writing course at a Scottish university and began his writing career. He lives in Norwich.Plot in a nutshell: Sean works in a chicken factory, waiting for the birds to come down his line where he will hoist them high into the sky and send them off. The story takes place in one day, with plenty of flashbacks, dreams and fantastical imaginings.Sean has a big problem to solve. His brother Archie, a hardened, drug-dealing criminal, is coming home from jail early. Prior to jail, Archie left a large amount of money with his little brother for safekeeping, and Sean, expecting Archie to be in for awhile, spent a good bit of it. Archie is the violent sort and is expecting the total when he gets home.Sean desperately begins a search to get the money together and runs into some hooligans and the like in doing so. But nothing compares to the violence or fear that Archie is about to bring down on his little brother's household.Sample of prose: \"It was scary waitin in the car. Ah heard a window breakin and things crashin and every time a car passed on the main road Ah thought is was the polis. Eventually Archie and Sammy appeared from the side of the house carryin a bed sheet between them. They ran to the back of the car and Ah felt the suspension go down with the weight of it. The boot slammed and they were in the car. They were giggling like wee lasies. Archie drove with no lights till we got on the main road. Then he was off like Jackie Stewart again... Everybody was smoking and drinkin and talking. Ah couldnay understand them coz of their accents.\"Author reminds me of: Nick Hornby, for his original Scottish sense of voice and language, and his mix of the macabre with humor.Best reason to read: The story is told in first person, alternating with third person, somewhat in the vein of the popular television show The Office. The language difference from the UK makes it even more enjoyable. As the author uses local dialect, we recognize the word, but realize that McNay has given it multiple meanings. While the language can be rough and there are a few R-rated scenes, this is a compelling, fun read.Justin Matott"}, {"userName": "Ian Mapp", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1598886-ian-mapp", "userReview": "This is a debut novel that is obviously inspired by Welsh and Niall Griffiths. Written in the first and third person in an easy to understand dialect it tells the day in the life of a blue collar worker in a chicken processing plant, sean o'grady - looking at his easy pleasures and the crosses that he has to bear.Most of these are based around his brother, archie - as we move backward and forward through time showing the relationship. In the past, we have his excalating descent into crime - from joy riding to drugs - in the present, we know that he is coming out of jail and wants back the \u00a31K that he asked his brother to look.Sean has spent this on (and this is revealed in comic stages) - his daughters school trip, christmas, his gambling addiction.There is a great bit in the middle of the book where he has borrowed the money from his uncle and heads off to try and win more in a game of cards in the despatch department - you think cliche and cause you do care about the character, will him not to go and lose the lot - before he is intercepted by Archies henchman and relieved of the money.The tension in the day escalates and to escape his brothers clutches, he first dobs him in to the police (nicely linked to a childhood friend), before having to stab him after he escaped the arrest. This is how the book ends.An exceptional debut, although nothing too new. Managed to read about 200 pages in a day, as i was ill and the humour drove it forward."}, {"userName": "Nathan Burgoine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3369240-nathan-burgoine", "userReview": "A day in the life of Sean O'Grady - and it's not going well. His brother is about to get out of jail, and discover that the money he'd trusted to Sean is missing a good portion. Sean needs to come up with the cash, fast. Weaving through Sean's past through his reveries and memories, and the present through Sean's troubles and worries, \"Fresh\" brings - if you'll pardon the pun - a fresh approach to a familiar style of tale telling. The rough and tumble language of the working class poor is gritty and real, as is the humour of coping that comes so easily to the same. Having grown up in England, much of this novel made me blink in remembrance, either linguistic, or just in the style and description that McNay dabs with such a deft brush. At times even funny, this dark tale is sure to sit well with those looking for a harsh, but literary, experience. There is social commentary as well as narrative, and the balance of character and action is appreciated."}, {"userName": "Mercedes", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1681146-mercedes", "userReview": "I have mixed feelings about this book. I loved the way the author wrote it in a Scottish/British accent. It wasn't written badly and the characters were well developed. It covers one day in the life of the main character Sean O'Grady who happens to work in a chicken packaging plant. But I don't know, there was something about it that stops me from actually falling head over heels for this book. The ending was good but could have been better. There was a lot of swearing and scenes that were not needed in the book, which were at times kind of a turn off. I did have some highish expectations for this book and it fell short. I guess somehow I thought it would be like a Guy Ritchie movie and it wasn't.

He tries to free himself from the noxious cloud that surrounds him which is caused not only by the scent of rotting chickens but by his psychotic brother Archie who is always hanging around, ready to put the boot into Sean's head should he step out of line.

Today, his psychotic brother has been granted an early release from prison. By tonight, he will come to collect the money Sean is holding. The problem? All the money's been spent. Welcome to a day in the life of Sean O'Grady, husband, father, and worker in a chicken-processing factory on the outskirts of Glasgow.As the novel opens on another seemingly typical day, Sean's world comes crashing down when he hears the news that his brother Archie has unexpectedly been released from prison. A terrifyingly violent career criminal, Archie is coming home to collect the money Sean was holding for him. But there's a problem: Sean has spent the money, assuming he would have plenty of time to replenish Archie's stash. As the day progresses and tensions escalate, Sean explores increasingly desperate ways of getting back the money. With a tight time frame, shaped by Archie's looming return, Fresh offers the reader a charged narrative full of grim comedy and foreboding, leavened by Sean's natural optimism, resilience, and his habit of slipping into fantasies of a more dashing and glamorous existence.", "title": "Fresh", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1566294.Fresh", "average": 3.28, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347712298l/1566294.jpg", "reviews": 26, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/728211.Mark_McNay", "name": "Mark McNay"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Humor"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1566294.Fresh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5989662-fresh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1957727.Fresh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2179149.Fresh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11864546-fresh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2760126-fresh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13244190-al-fresco", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2760127-under-control", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13578982-imagination", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
