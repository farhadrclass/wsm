Yes, it\u2019s about men, but there\u2019s little or nothing about mice in these pages. Mice enthusiasts will come away disappointed. This got me thinking about other novel titles. You would have to say that such books as The Slap, The Help, The Great Gatsby, Gangsta Granny, Mrs Dalloway and Hamlet have very good titles because they are all about a slap, some help, a Gatsby who was really great, a no good granny, a woman who was married to a guy called Dalloway and a Hamlet. I have no problem with those titles. But you may be poring over the pages of To Kill a Mockingbird for a long fruitless evening to find any mockingbirds coming to any harm at all. Indeed, to coin a phrase, no mockingbirds were harmed during the making of that book. So I rate that title only 5% accurate. And some titles seem to have a word missing, such as Conan Doyle\u2019s The Sign of Four. Four what? It doesn\u2019t say. Perhaps he completed the book and left the title to the very last minute and died as he was writing it down. Same thing with The Crimson Petal and the White.  White what? Wallpaper? Hat? Cat? Mouse? Mockingbird? Could be The Crimson Petal and the White Gangsta Granny for all we know. A poor title. And what about The Dharma Bums? I think a Cigarette or You Out is clearly missing from that title. Another grossly misleading title is Women in Love . I can\u2019t be the only reader who was expecting some strong girl on girl action from DH Lawrence but I would have been better off fast-forwarding to the middle part of Mulholland Drive.  Now that\u2019s what I call Women in Love.  DH, take note. Another badly chosen title is Hitler\u2019s Niece - yes, it is 100% accurate, but at first glance it can look like Hitler\u2019s Nice, and surely that is going to put off a lot of potential readers (except for the readers you really don\u2019t want). And what about Call it Sleep? \u2013 call what sleep? The Catcher in the Rye, The Postman Always Rings Twice, Flaubert\u2019s Parrot, The Camomile Lawn \u2013 sometimes obscure titles can be solved if you understand that the author is referring to Death, so, the Catcher is Death, the Postman is Death, the lawn is Death and the Parrot is Death. Of course, I may have got that wrong. It\u2019s something I read somewhere and it just stuck in my mind. Some other titles I would give low ratings to :The Turn of the Screw  completely baffled me \u2013 I know that \u201cscrew\u201d is what inmates call prison officers, so I was expecting a story about a concert put on by the staff of a large correctional institution. It was nothing like that. The Little Prince according to my system does rate 100% but I still think The Little Faux-naif Idiot would have been better.The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay \u2013 actually, I rate this as 90% accurate \u2013 there are two guys who are named Kavalier and Clay, and they do have adventures, but they aren\u2019t amazing. A Clockwork Orange \u2013 this must be a metaphor for \u201cI have given up thinking of a title for my novel\u201dNo Name \u2013 like A Clockwork Orange this must be where the author couldn\u2019t think of any title so in this case he left it without one, like the Byrds\u2019 album Untitled, or  () by Sigur Ros, or several paintings by De Kooning and those other abstract expressionist types; but to call a novel No Name is self-defeating, because No Name then becomes its name \u2013 epic fail, Mr Collins.The Violent Bear it Away - this is another example of a word missing - possibly \"took\" or \"dragged\", I expect that's the sort of thing a violent bear would do I\u2019m surprised the publisher did not catch this error."}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "I needed a quick read because I stupidly forgot that the library would be closed yesterday for Veteran's Day. I'd exhausted my current supply, and I needed a short term fix to hold me until I could get some new product today. So I grabbed Of Mice and Men off the bookshelf last night.And I'm glad I did because I'd somehow remembered that this was a depressing book. How wrong I was! Oh, sure there were some tense moments like when you think Lennie will accidently hurt Curley's wife in the barn. What a relief when George and Candy come in at the last minute and stop anything bad from happening! And isn't it nice that the scare changes both Curley and his wife so that they have a much better marriage and new appreciation for each other.Plus, it leads to the great moment when Curley is so grateful that he fronts George, Lennie and Candy the money to finally buy the ranch of their dreams. Oh, and that last scene with George and Candy on the porch of their new home while Lennie tends the rabbits brought a tear to my eye.What's that you say? I got the ending wrong? No, I'm quite certain this is what happened. No! Be quiet! I can't hear you!

I remember the teacher droning on about basic plot allegories before we read each section; she would tell us what certain things \u201cmeant\u201d before we had even seen them. She would explain how this portrays a vital part of American culture and a vital element of human nature. All in all we were told what to see in the book before we even began reading. Perhaps she should have just let us read it first, and see what we took from it before being told how to read it. I hated it at the time. I hated being told that passages meant certain things when clearly criticism is just speculation. This wasn\u2019t effective teaching: it was being told how to think. She should have prized open our minds and made us engage with it more. When I approached it again years later I did so with more of an open mind, I was determined to find more in the book than I\u2019d been taught to see. And I did. Lenny and George naively dream of the farm; they dream of a retreat where they can reside in friendship without having to answer to any master. They wouldn\u2019t have to go to work; they can simply work for themselves. Running their own farm would mean that they are self-sustainable. They could grow crops for themselves and choose when they laboured: they would be free. Well George wants this. Lenny just wants a few rabbits to pet. The attractiveness of the dream draws in Candy, who is very old and very lonely. He doesn\u2019t want to end up like his dog: put down because of his years. He wants someone to protect him and care for him in his advanced years. The three become united by this shared dream but it is nothing but fancy. \u201cJust like heaven. Ever\u2019body wants a little piece of lan\u2019. I read plenty of books out here. Nobody never gets to heaven, and nobody gets no land. It\u2019s just in their head. They\u2019re all the time talkin\u2019 about it, but it\u2019s jus\u2019 in their head.\u201dIndeed, the American dream doesn\u2019t exist in this book. Only harsh cold reality awaits the protagonists. Crooks, for all his cruel and understandable bitterness, was right in the end. The farm is just a dream. It is evocative of the loneliness within the human soul, and how we will always long for the impossible. It\u2019s impossible because there is no sunset over the rainbow. Life doesn\u2019t quite work like that. People don\u2019t always get what they want. The world is a cruel unforgiving place here. This is embodied by Lenny; he is vulnerable and emotionally weak. He is completely unaware of the vicious strength he possesses. He never truly understands the situation. He almost walks through the world blind. The world he sees is different to that of everyone else\u2019s. So this is a story about the outsiders, about the unloved and misunderstood. This a story about those that long for an alternative to the drudgery of standard human existence, but have their expectations cut short. This is a story about how we judge people based upon their appearance and how we label them unjustly. This is a story that Mary Shelley would have loved, a story where a character with an innocent heart is destroyed by the world he should have been accepted by."}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "I think I've been avoiding John Steinbeck, consciously or subconsciously, ever since I was a horse-loving teenager and thought that The Red Pony would be a nice, pleasant book to read.I didn't read any Steinbeck books for years.But I was in the local library, puttering around in the general fiction shelves, and happened to pull this one out and noticed how short it was--only 107 pages. I had just finished reading Jonathan Livingston Seagull, which was a 127-page overdose of cheesy 70's inspiration, and it occurred to me that by reading this book to offset JLS I could restore the cosmic balance in my life, or something like that.Lennie and George are a unique pair of friends: George is restless, intelligent and often short-tempered; Lennie is huge and incredibly strong, although mentally damaged. He has a childlike sweetness but is easily confused and frightened, and that combined with his strength makes him threatening to others. Somehow, despite their differences, the two have formed a friendship. George tries to protect Lennie from the world . . . and the world from Lennie. It's a difficult task. But they have their dreams and plans of a place of their own, where they can tend a garden and raise animals. And Lennie can take care of the rabbits. It's the most heavenly thing he can imagine.George and Lennie are hired as field hands at a ranch in California, and the foreshadowings of disaster start to come thick and fast. An old sheepdog whose usefulness has passed is unceremoniously shot. The owner's son Curley comes around to their bunkhouse, spoiling for a fight. Curley's young, bored wife comes around even more often, looking for a different kind of trouble. The hands are sure that they only need a month or two of wages to achieve their plans of a place of their own, but the best-laid schemes of mice and men gang oft agley.I was expecting to read about shattered dreams, but I was surprised and touched by the strength of the theme of true friendship--not just the friendship between George and Lennie, but also the friendship and understanding offered by Slim, the ranch foreman. With all of the loneliness and cruelty and loss and disappointment that life can bring, it's this one message of hope that I choose to take away from this short but powerful book."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "608.\tOf Mice And Men, John SteinbeckOf Mice and Men is a novella written by author John Steinbeck.

way Steinbeck describes things that gets me.\"Crooks, the negro stable buck, had his bunk in the harness room; a little shed that leaned off the wall of the barn. On one side of the little room there was a square four-paned window, and on the other, a narrow plank door leading into the barn. Crooks' bunk was a long box filled with straw, on which his blankets were flung. On the wall by the window there were pegs on which hung broken harness in process of being mended; strips of new leather; and under the window itself a little bench for leather-working tools, curved knives and needles and balls of linen thread, and a small hand riveter. On pegs were also pieces of harness, a split collar with the horsehair stuffing sticking out, a broken hame, and a trace chain with its leather covering split. Crooks had his apple box over his bunk, and in it a range of medicine bottles, both for himself and for the horses. There were cans of saddle soap and a drippy can of tar with its paint brush sticking over the edge. And scattered about the floor were a number of personal possessions; for, being alone, Crooks could leave his things about, ad being a stable buck and a cripple, he was more permanent than the other men, and he had accumulated more possessions than he could carry on his back.\"None of this is relevant to the story, and yet a middle chapter opens up with this vivid scene. Steinbeck succeeds because the characters he paints in your head are exact. The first time I saw the movie that was made out of this story, it was just as I had envisioned it. Though the story great itself, the reason I will come back to this book is for the little things, the very things that have made me love Steinbeck so much. I first read Of Mice And Men my sophomore year of high school, when it was a required reading in Mrs. Beeler's class. I recall disliking almost all required school readings up to this point (though admittedly I had skipped out on the summer reading project of \"The Grapes Of Wrath\"). When this book was assigned, I knew it was different. I blew through it, reading it in a day or two, even though I wasn't supposed to. For once there was a school book that I enjoyed. And all the credit in the world to my teacher, who chose other good books the rest of the year. So it's been 6-7 years since I've read this, and now, reading it for the second time, it's just as memorable as I remember. The story sticks with you, the imagery sticks. The characters are among Steinbeck's best, painted in such a crystal clear vision of the time.It's a near perfect short story, and one that I will surely revisit throughout my life."}, {"userName": "Brina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina", "userReview": "Over the past year, I have rediscovered John Steinbeck as a master American story teller. Having read Cannery Row and its follow up Sweet Thursday, I realized what a prolific author Steinbeck was and hope to continue my reading with a number of his novels this year. One novella I did read while in school but have a fuzzy memory of is Of Mice and Men. With a square on this year's classic bingo board being read a group read that you haven't read yet, I decided that it was as good a time as any to revisit this work of Steinbeck's through adult eyes.Near the Salinas River and Soledad, California, two nomadic farm hands named George and Lennie stake out their existence in life. George dreams of having his own farm house and acreage but it is during the depression and he has little money saved. He also promised Aunt Clara, really a family friend, that he would take care of her nephew Lennie, a dimwitted yet strong man. Steinbeck portrays George as an average man during his era who attempts to find work in order to make ends meet, yet he has the added burden of caring for and providing for Lennie's well being. Had this been written in contemporary times, Lennie would have been characterized as developmentally disabled or autistic, yet in the 1930s society could not pinpoint what ailed people like Lennie. They were dismissed as dimwitted with little future, preventing those caring for them in having many prospects for bettering themselves either.The reader finds out that Lennie loves animals although with his limited mental capacity he does not have success in caring for them, killing one mouse, rabbit, or puppy after another. Steinbeck alludes to the fact that the reason that George and Lennie are in between jobs is because Lennie had felt a woman's dress meaning no harm, yet the act alarmed other members of their work team, forcing the duo to flee the premises. As the pair approaches yet another farm, George makes Lennie promise to keep his mouth shut, to do whatever George asks him to, and to please stay out of trouble. Despite the best of intentions, with Lennie's condition being what it is, he does not always remember to do what George asks of him, putting both of their futures in jeopardy.As in past jobs, George quickly becomes friendly with the rest of the work crew, attempting to distance himself from Lennie. Lennie ends up attempting a friendship with the rest of the outcasts on the farm, including a Negro horseshoe hand, yet even this relationship ends in tragedy. When Lennie's actions result in tragic proportions, George must choose between protecting Lennie and thinking of himself and his own future, with the denouement coming to a upsetting climax. I could not help but thinking that if George and Lennie lived today with society's awareness of degrees of developmental delays, that both George and Lennie would have enjoyed a happier existence. The burden of caring for Lennie would not have been placed on George, and Lennie himself would have been taught the rudimentary aspects of self care and perhaps even been placed in a basic job. Yet, placing George and Lennie in modern times is hearsay and their relationship ended in tragedy with Steinbeck placing George in a precarious situation which he would have to dwell upon for the rest of his life. In reading Steinbeck I have seen how he has done a masterful job in painting his characters as archetypes of the era in which they lived, usually depression era California. George and Lennie are two men looking to better themselves in a decade when one had little to be happy about. While rereading this tragic novella, I could not help but think if like other books I read for school if this is above most teenagers heads. Perhaps, teachers could discuss George and Lennie's relationship and where Lennie would be if he lived today, much as I did while reading. Yet, like other books I read at the time, Of Mice and Men gains a deeper appreciation while reading it through adult eyes. Another bingo square checked off, yet definitely not the last Steinbeck novel I will devour this year.4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Joe Valdez", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26876584-joe-valdez", "userReview": "What more can I possibly add to a discussion of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men without drawing a high school English teacher's salary? Considering I'm not drawing bored glances from teenagers, I doubt that a check from LAUSD will appear in my mailbox anytime soon. -- Published in 1937, this is the work that the Goodreads algorithms seem to have agreed is the author's most renowned. For Stephen King, it's The Shining, for Elmore Leonard it's Get Shorty and for John Steinbeck it's Of Mice and Men. -- This is a novella, approximate length 34,720 words. I read it in under forty-eight hours.-- The story revolves around two ranch hands traveling the highways and ranches of California, looking out for each other and trying to build enough of a stake to put down on their own piece of land. Both were dressed in denim trousers and in denim coats with brass buttons. Both wore black, shapeless hats and both carried tight blanket rolls slung over their shoulders. The first man was small and quick, dark of face, with restless eyes and sharp, strong features. Every part of him was defined: small, strong hands, slender arms, a thin and bony nose. Behind him walked his opposite, a huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes, with wide, sloping shoulders; and he walked heavily, dragging his feet a little, the way a bear drags his paws. His arms did not swing at his sides, but hung loosely.-- George Milton is the small man, the thinker. Lennie Small is the child in a hulk's body. Walking ten miles to a barley ranch south of Soledad after a bus driver with a grudge drops them off on the highway far short of their destination, Lennie is fascinated by petting mice or rabbits or anything with a nice texture. Lennie has never laid a hand on George, enamored by the tales his traveling partner tells of the land they'll settle someday. When the men finally arrive for work, George does the talking.\"He ain't no cuckoo,\" said George. \"He's dumb as hell, but he ain't crazy. An' I ain't so bright neither, or I wouldn't be buckin' barley for my fifty and found. If I was bright, if I was even a little bit smart, I'd have my own little place, an' I'd be bringin' in my own crops, 'stead of doin' all the work and not getting what comes up outta the ground.\" George fell silent. He wanted to talk. Slim neither encouraged nor discouraged him. He just sat back quiet and receptive.-- One of the reasons John Steinbeck is my favorite author is that when he pens description, I don't want it to end, and when he switches to dialogue, I don't want his characters to stop talking either. Stephen King's dialogue can be tin, while Elmore Leonard's attentiveness when it comes to prose is short spanned to say the least, but Steinbeck's descriptions and dialogue achieve a purity that captivates me. It's like the difference between drinking water from a garden hose that's been drying in the sun with who knows what crawling inside it and one day, someone hands you a bottle of Perrier.-- While most authors have been around people, with Steinbeck, I'm always left with the undeniable impression he watched and achieved a wisdom about people. Then he works that knowledge into his books and passes it along to the reader. I find myself able to relate to Steinbeck more than I can the majority of contemporary authors, who often seem to have never been around humans who dreamed, drank, lusted, got into fights or trouble with the law, fell out with family members or worried about where their next meal might come from.Crooks said gently, \"Maybe you can see now. You got George. You know he's goin' to come back. S'pose you didn't have nobody. S'pose you couldn't go into the bunkhouse and play rummy 'cause you was black. How'd you like that? S'pose you had to sit out here an' read books. Sure you could play horseshoes till it got dark, but then you got to read books. Books ain't no good. A guy needs somebody--to be near him.\" He whined, \"A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody. Don't make no difference who the guy is, long as he's with you. I tell ya,\" he cried, \"I tell ya a guy gets too lonely an' he gets sick.\"-- For those joining late, I'm no English teacher, but if I encountered someone who was adamant that they didn't read fiction (I'm thinking men here) and I wanted to try to get them to change their attitude, Of Mice and Men would be the novel I'd hand them. It's short, it's about men and work and figuring out a better future and loyalty and how things don't always work out the way you dream they will. Yet the writing takes me away to another place. I couldn't last a day bucking barley or bucking a sack of anything, but as Steinbeck knows well, we all yearn to be on the open road, traveling, camping out on a river and maybe eating beans just because we felt like it.-- Lastly, Of Mice and Men has been adapted to film twice: a 1939 production starring Burgess Meredith as George and Lon Chaney Jr. as Lennie and a 1992 film with Gary Sinise as George and John Malkovich as Lennie. Reading the novel, I heard Sinise's voice as George. As Lennie, I heard the Abominable Snowman from the 1949 Looney Toons short directed by Chuck Jones, The Abominable Snow Rabbit. References to Steinbeck's novel have been dropped by a ton of cartoon series, perhaps as much a tribute to Jones as to Steinbeck, but the homage that stands out for me are the characters of Pinky and the Brain on Animaniacs."}, {"userName": "Mariah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22371819-mariah", "userReview": "This is a story about George Milton and Lennie Small, two migrant ranch workers, who move from place to place in California in search of new job opportunities during the Great Depression in the United States. George Milton is intelligent but uneducated and Lennie Small is extremely physically strong but mentally disabled. After being hired at a farm, the pair are confronted by the Boss's son who dislikes Lennie. Another worker on the farm offers to help pay to buy a farm with George and Lennie. However, the next day Lennie accidentally kills his puppy while stroking it. After finding out about Lennie's habit, the farmer's wife offers to let him stroke her hair. When she starts to panic and scream Lennie becomes nervous and breaks her neck\u2026 This leads to a very tragic ending...Of course, when reading a classic novel I have to research the author and find out \"more.\"This book was based on Steinbeck's own experiences as a bindlestiff in the 1920s. He got the title from Robert Burns' poem \"To a Mouse,\" which read: \"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men.\" (The best laid schemes of mice and men)I suggest this book to anyone that enjoys short classics that don't have happy endings."}, {"userName": "Dolors", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors", "userReview": "Only a writer capable of assembling the symbolic with the folkloric can pen a novella that straddles genres, writing techniques and figurative voices and tug at the heartstrings of both commonplace audiences and the most exigent of readers. Such indisputable universality is what Steinbeck accomplished with \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d, a fabled novella with a linear plot delivered in a succession of theatrical scenes, compact on the surface and with simply drawn characters that might be accused of being excessively melodramatic and verging on the caricaturesque.Yet when reflected upon, this deceivingly modest tale appears designed in concentric layers of deep meaning that orchestrate a rich parable on thematic complexities like the natural goodness of man, the alienation triggered by a socio-economic system that endorses exploitative working conditions and the need to cling to illusions to face a mirthless existence.Set in a few miles south of Soledad, Spanish for \u201csolitude\u201d, Steinbeck introduces two antithetic characters combining coarse and fast paced dialogue with lush descriptions of the Salinas river.Lennie Small is ironically heavily built and as strong as he is good-natured. Of a gullible disposition and feeble minded he depends solely on his workmate George to be hired as a temporary hand harvesting seasonal crops in the farms of California. George, a sharp and resourceful rogue, tries to protect Lennie mostly from himself but also from the maliciousness inherent in most of their fellow labourers. They both dream of owning a rabbit farm and \u201cliving off the fatta the lan\u2019 \u201d, an ideal that Lennie begs George to repeat over and over again with the exact same words creating the mesmerizing effect of an invocation or a soothing lullaby that equals a spell capable of transforming the inconceivable into a tangible possibility.Alternating the romantic with the myopic vision of hope and gloom, the story is shaped by the intense friendship between these disparate characters and their legitimate aspirations to achieve a respectable livelihood, creating an expansive allegory for the dehumanization the itinerant labourers were victims of during the years ensuing the Great Depression. George\u2019s attempts to shelter Lennie from the viciousness of foremen and masters also exposes the juxtaposition between the innate solidarity of man and its posterior corruption when trapped in the dynamics of an abusive social hierarchy.The lonely(*), the dispossessed and the crippled become the easy target of such system with only love, friendship and compassion as shielding forces.\u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d is a heart-warming story with a chilling conclusion. A story of marginalized men and women who live on the fringes of an impassive society and navigate the stirred waters of human dignity and animalization, reason and instinct, courage and weariness, narcotic dreams and hopeful illusions. In the same way an innocent dummy might crush a tiny mouse unwillingly and with only good intentions human beings crush each other not truly grasping the full consequences of their atrocious acts. There is irony in that equation, but a gentle one.This is a dark tale, a bitter pill to swallow. It hurts. But it also illuminates with its moving tenderness, allegorical scope and unflinching naturalism. Dreams mightn\u2019t come true this time, but maybe that\u2019s a weighty reason to start loving the things we\u2019ve got.(*) A quick note to mention Steinbeck\u2019s shocking depiction of women as an object of desire who use erotic mysticism to lure men into the social stability offered by marriage. This notion highly contrasts with his previous approach to the essential role of females in the family unit as seen in The Grapes of Wrath.Perfect soundtrack for this book:Things that stop you dreaming"}, {"userName": "Whitney Atkinson", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson", "userReview": "I think it's tradition for me to finish a classic and think, \"That was good, but I wonder what insights and symbolism I missed out on since I didn't read this for class and have a professor telling me about it.\" It's also just really hard to review classics in general, because whereas \"normal\" books I can pick apart the plot, characters, pace, etc., there's something different about these. I feel like I always expect classics to be deep and mindblowing with huge world-shifting themes, but in reality, it's totally normal to be disappointed by them. In this case, I spent most of this book wondering what the point was. I wondered if I was just not connecting to this because it was too short, or because of the very slang dialogue, but by the end of this everything just clicked into place and I actually went into my mom's room to discuss.

The story brilliantly shows how easy it is to make dreams a reality, how obvious it is to have dreams and chase them.But Steinbeck slowly turns things into a nightmare by introducing Curley and his wife. Just by getting in with the wrong crowd at the wrong time and having a few character flaws, Steinbeck shows how dreams are really made of nothing, held together by nothing, and can be torn apart seconds before they become real.Steinbeck might not be known for moving fast, and although this story starts off slow with the signature lengthy landscape description, in only about 30 pages, the twists and turns begin, and once they do, the story reads like a character-driven thriller--with some of the most memorable characters in literature thrown in the mix.The way all of the character flaws combine at just the right time to trigger an epic explosion is reminiscent of The Great Gatsby. And being so short, and how it reads so easy, and how relatable it is to have dreams and have them ripped away for reasons almost uncontrollable, Of Mice and Men is a masterpiece unlike anything else ever written."}, {"userName": "\u0641\u0631\u0634\u0627\u062f", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31207039", "userReview": "\u0634\u0627\u0647\u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u0648\u0642\u200c\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0637 \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0648 \u0633\u0631\u06af\u0630\u0634\u062a \u063a\u0645 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0632 \u062f\u0648 \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06af\u0631.. \u0646\u062b\u0631 \u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u0648 \u0631\u06cc\u062a\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u062b\u0631 \u0628\u0647\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0647 \u0634\u062e\u0635\u06cc\u062a \u067e\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0641\u0648\u0642\u200c\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u06af\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0631\u0648\u0627\u06cc\u062a\u060c \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u0627\u062b\u0631 \u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0634\u062f\u062a \u0644\u0630\u062a \u0628\u062e\u0634 \u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\u0647 \u0648 \u062f\u0631\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc\u062a \u067e\u0627\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u0627\u0698\u06cc\u06a9 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0647\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u062c\u0627\u06cc \u0647\u06cc\u0686 \u0628\u062d\u062b\u06cc \u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0642\u06cc \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u06af\u0630\u0627\u0631\u0647.."}, {"userName": "*TANYA*", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29049556-tanya", "userReview": "I had read this back in high school when it was mandated.

I never read Of Mice and Men as required reading assignment.]Tell us how it's gonna be...I've never wanted a book to spontaneously change endings so badly. I yearn for that little place as much as they do. I wanted them to have it desperately. Proof the incredibly sad ending isn't hopeless is that on a reread I could still hope it would end differently. Oh, it does happen, loneliness and cruelty and mass mob hating mentality. The possibility that it won't, that people might come through, is still a chance. Otherwise why bother reading a book such as this one.Lennie dying alone like a dog haunts me. The dying with honor issue I've read about in other stuff isn't an issue with me. Dignity, yes, because in this case the dying was robbing his life of dignity. Lennie had precious little of it as it was. I know that in those times that kind of thing was not unheard of (or much later than that). Still, depressing as shit. Maybe those kinds of hateful things make some kind of a stain on the atmosphere, like a ghost. (If ghosts exist, I imagine they'd come out of something like that. Why are ghosts usually from like Colonial usa or Civil War times? Not the 1970s?) So the dying and the living are the same as both are long over. It should never have to be that way. Curly's wife haunts me. I related her to Lennie in their inability to think and mourning what happens without any possibility of understanding why. I see in her other abused women and find it heartbreaking and frustrating and reminding.Of Mice and Men touched on a lot for such a little story. I find that I think of it for comparions when thinking about things like what we owe other people, and expectations of ourselves and others. George's exhaustion of taking care of Lennie, and how everybody else let him down. It's awful to be completely alone, and awful to have to carry so much yourself. Burdens can also make you feel weighted to something. I don't know, I just think about George sometimes. I catch myself being suspicious of what people want, want, want from everybody and those expectations and then I remember George and how it wasn't all bad having someone else to think about like he did for Lennie. It's scary to rely on anyone else. I get why George wanted his little place.Read this the first time in a middle school science class by holding the book under the desk and ever so slightly ducking my head to read my lap. (Probably as subtle as kids today text messaging.) I had a hard time keeping it together. (Any time they talked about their little place with Candy made me squirm in my seat in excitement.) (I stopped reading books under the desk after that. Did it all the time in elementary school, but for lighter fare like Ramona Quimby series and Dr. Suess.) [I read it on the sly. The smart kids were forced to read it. Maybe those kids were sneaking in The Outsiders inside their textbooks?]"}, {"userName": "Rebbie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6582211-rebbie", "userReview": "Oh God. I want more. I *need* more. I'm a giant ball of sheer emotion right now, as many people must've been when they finished this story. Dang it, John Steinbeck, how could you do this to us?

Maybe I'm just a glutton for punishment...but I can't be the only one who's had such a visceral reaction to this story.Lennie and George. George and Lennie. Two lonely men who live on the fringe of society, desperately clinging to a far off dream that could bring them comfort and stability. Only a transient, a dirt poor traveler who scrapes their pennies together would know how sad it is to live this way. To live trying to keep your back to the wind, so to speak. To eke out a family from the outcasts, the unwanteds, the forgotten people. George was given a reason to live, even if that reason was a burden that felt like a cross to bear. His loyalty made him feel responsible for Lennie no matter what, which is the mark of a beautiful soul.Hope and the death of it. Or rather, clinging to the last shred of hope lest your dignity dies with it. The loss of dignity or hope is the one thing in life that can cause someone to go 'round the curve of the point of no return, and not look back. To have nothing left to lose is frightening.

What a heartbreaking book... many students in American high schools read this one around 9th or 10th grade, and it provokes such sensitive topics to be discussed. A quick summary: Lenny and George are drifters looking for work. Lenny is a little slow and has a few disabilities that weren't addressed when he was younger, likely due to time time period (early 20th century) when they had ability to ignore these types of illnesses. Unfortunately, it has disastrous consequences for him and for George. Men can be cruel. So can be women. Lenny tends to hold on to things a little too tightly when he's scared. He's lost a few pets and things he loved, as a result. One day, a woman pushes him a little too far, more than he's capable of understanding, and he reacts in fear. George must find a way to cover it up, and his only recourse is to take his own disastrous actions. No spoilers here, but you probably get the drift already. No matter if you know the end, you still need to read the story to see how people treat one another because they are different or they aren't perceptive enough to understand their own consequences. This books helps people understand what happens when you lose control. It helps you figure out what you might need to do to protect someone. And it helps show who's (wo)man enough to stand up for others or to sit back and watch bad things happen. It's charged and full of emotion and fear. I struggled a little with some of the secondary characters and the setting, no my favorite. If it were set in a bit more modern times, I might have given this one a 5. But it's absolutely worth reading whenever you have a chance to find a quiet corner and be ready for a bit of a cry and a flood of questions, answers and thoughts.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.

Who cares how well the story is written that gets you there.The very quality of the writing here made the experience worse for me. It has been brought to my attention of late that Steinbeck was a gifted writer. It's true he was, and the message in the story he relates here carries that much more weight. I suppose the bottom line is, I live in the world where pain happens, a lot. I don't really need it here. So, I leave my rating as it is because my experience here remains a 1 star experience. So, as I said for you who love this book, and I know some...I'm happy for you, I don't and I can't really recommend it."}, {"userName": "Eryn\u2735", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17568354-eryn", "userReview": "4/5This won't be a \"real\" review, however I wanted to point out how I read this in Middle School and didn't enjoy it -- and now at 20 years old, I thought it was amazing!

How will I react this time?*********************I am so moved! I don't know how to express adequately how much I loved this book. You know everybody thinks, \"Oh Chrissie, she just appreciates non-fiction.\" Well that is not true, but I do set high standards. Sure, non-fiction you can count on for teaching, for providing knowledge you lacked before. Because you can learn something it is seldom a waste of time, but rarely can a book of non-fiction move you emotionally. I want fiction to capture real emotions and people portrayed as they really are. This book does that. Outstanding fiction has creativity, imagination and gorgeous lines. Non-fiction doesn\u2019t. This book has all three. This book teaches too, about relationships and about what is important in life. The dialogs are pitch-perfect. Each character is intricately drawn. The language is simple and clear, easy to understand and at times utterly beautiful or moving or heartrending. One cannot read this book and not be moved. I absolutely LOVE this book. I am not telling you much, am I? I am just gushing. The book is about friendship and about kindness and about how so much more important kindness is over knowledge or intelligence.The audiobook narration by Clarke Peters is stunning. I recommend that you listen to this rather than read it. Each character's intonation fit the character's personality perfectly. Usually I want to myself imagine how a person saying this or that might sound. Peters made each sound exactly as I wanted each one to sound. I wouldn't change anything. *****************Here in order of preference are the books by Steinbeck which I have read: Of Mice and Men 5 starsThe Grapes of Wrath 5 starsTravels with Charley: In Search of America (4 stars)The Moon Is Down (4 stars)Cannery Row (4 stars)The Winter of Our Discontent (3 stars)The Pearl (3stars)Sweet Thursday (2 stars)East of Eden (2 stars)"}, {"userName": "Embraced_evils", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/996057-embraced-evils", "userReview": "Usually when my father and I actually have conversations, it tends to revolve around some sort of argument. At times, even if I agree with him, I\u2019d pick up the opposite side of the given argument just for arguments sake. When we agree we fall silent, and our relationship is based for the most part on silence the chance to argue is usually too good to pass up. When I was younger I\u2019d end up in tears, frustrated that he couldn\u2019t look beyond his own view points\u2026in retrospect I suppose I could have said the same for myself. I didn\u2019t let up enough to ever consider his side. We both just sort of took this cocky and aggressive tone, he was just better at playing it out\u2026he still is, I suppose it has to do with the difference in age. No matter how thoughtful an argument might have been, or a question, or a thought, anything I posed to question him that he in turn could give no answer to, he\u2019d settle simply by saying I didn\u2019t have the experience or age to understand. I haven\u2019t yet come to terms with the fact that I\u2019ll never be able to catch up, and that somehow I\u2019ll never stop being a child in his eyes\u2026hell I can\u2019t stop being a child in my own eyes. It\u2019s different with him though, someday I\u2019d like to be right by his standards.Any way, while I was reading Of Mice and Men I couldn\u2019t stop thinking of an argument my father and I had when I was very young. We were talking about the bible and my decision whether or not to read it. He didn\u2019t try to lead me in any direction but he wanted me to understand one thing. Reading the bible he said was like a \u201cdouble edged sword\u201d. His theory (not his exclusively, obviously) was that if one read the bible and understood it then the standards for getting into heaven were harder. I think the equation went something like this:1.\tignorance = innocence2.\tinnocence always gets into heaven, because you can forgive innocence. I asked if that meant people who\u2019ve never read the bible got into heaven. My father answered that they did, because it wasn\u2019t their fault they had never been \u2018shown\u2019 the way. But that only meant there was more pressure for the people who had \u2018seen\u2019 the way because then they made a conscience choice to walk down that path, or take another way. The weight of this whole idea was ignored for a long time on my part; I remember scoffing at my father. It seemed ridiculous, the possibility of bad people getting into heaven just because they never knew better. This was back when I was a far more judgmental person. Though I can\u2019t really deny that in my heart, the idea of God being so forgiving was a relief. I liked the view my father held, but I didn\u2019t want to agree with it.Reading Of Mice and Men sort of brought that argument back to my mind. My father\u2019s theory has evolved into a belief all on its own changed completely but with the same genuine heart. People aren\u2019t bad; people are products of events, of situations. I wouldn\u2019t say people are a 100% of their past, because in the living instant an individual has the ability to choose and has true undeniable free will over memories and expectations of the future. But if a person lives a very hard life, the possibilities of that individual repeating past mistakes is higher. Regardless\u2026that was sort of off the subject.I think Lennie is the incarnation of everything wonderful and painful that makes up innocence. And not the sweet sort of innocence that people seem to wish to portray as a good quality. It\u2019s the sort of innocence that\u2019s rooted in ignorance. Lennie\u2019s innocence is rooted in a mental disorder however, but it doesn\u2019t really change the perspective for me. Mentally he\u2019s a child, and children are innocent. When Lennie died I thought about that a lot. Though this book didn\u2019t in any way deal with the question of religion or god, or anything close to it, I couldn\u2019t help but know that Lennie would go to heaven. Really it was an odd thing to think about after reading such a powerful and emotional piece. My favorite character however would have to be Curley\u2019s Wife. All the characters in this story had such an important roll, meaningful and diving deep into their psyche. All but Curley\u2019s Wife, whose soul purpose in this story was to die, and prove that lust in the end undoes itself. Curley\u2019s wife, who in my opinion represented nothing but lustfulness in a pool of odd but incredibly deep characters, is the most honest reflection of reality found in this book. \u201cCurley\u2019s wife lay with a half-covering of yellow hay. And the meanness and the plannings and the discontent and the ache for attention were all gone from her face. She was very pretty and simple, and her face was sweet and young.\u201d (93)It\u2019s those little pearls of awareness thrown in her direction that made me love her. \u201cthe ache for attention\u201d, who doesn\u2019t know that feeling? And the idea that the only way to get rid of that ache, or the discontent and the meanness (sometimes done purposely sometimes done in ignorance) can only be beat with death. And having this representation of lust (passion for life) being killed by the representation of innocence (who generally is not at all that different from lust, or passion, the difference being only in the \u2018plannings\u2019) is painful. Where a passion for life called for planning and deliberation, for learning how to use the body and the mind\u2026for a pure and simple ache to be known and seen was ended so quickly by innocence who just took what it wanted.  And on a completely different note that\u2019s borderline ranting\u2026I really enjoyed the story, and I am glad I decided to read the book again since I didn\u2019t have much of a recollection from high school, but Jesus Christ what is up with the huge bunny at the end? I understand that it was a manifestation of Lennies mind, but GOD\u2026a giant bunny? It seemed so cartoonish here at the climax of this emotional story."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "[image error]"}], "description": "The compelling story of two outsiders striving to find their place in an unforgiving world.
