This time around the focus has shifted to the Hunters and the Tainted as the human race has all but been wiped out. Unbeknownst to them though, there is a far greater threat around the corner, waiting to wipe out everybody...This was another great addition to the series. It was nice to see the drama from the other side of the fence. The gore factor was ramped up this time, as was the tension. The new threat was unlike anything we have seen before, and could only have come from Ian's twisted mind! The story was solid, and had me turning page after page in a rush to see what happened next. I understand Ian is hard at work on the next one, hurry up Ian, we can't wait!!"}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19184609-angie", "userReview": "This was a bit different from the previous zombie Armageddon books as the monsters and the tainted were more the focus and the UK had the American military in London. As usual things don't go according to plan. They really didn't have enough information and to be fair, how could they!!One of the new breeds, Raphael, a four armed touch black skinned monster is just so cool. He's easily the best part of the book. He's got his plans but all he really wants is to get laid and eat lots.Its going to be lots different in the next book as the book goes to America. I'm going to miss reading all about the people in the north of England but it will completely refresh the series. I can't wait to see how the zombies change next. I've already got book 7. Such awesome books."}, {"userName": "Leslie Wiederspan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18142405-leslie-wiederspan", "userReview": "After reading all 6 books, I can say, it was awful. The editing is horrid. I thought it was just the first few, but all of them are horribly written. If you can get past the numerous spelling and grammar mistakes, even the story has holes in it. Spider humans? That just doesn't make sense. And don't bother keeping all the characters straight, because most if them die just when you figure out who they are. The others come and go, but you still never find out what happens to the ones that dominated that particular book. Aliza and Dominic are forgotten, among others. To make it worse, it still ends with a cliffhanger."}, {"userName": "Christa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26558868-christa", "userReview": "Wow this series just gets better!!
