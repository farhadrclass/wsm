I haven't read the first book but it didn't stop me from enjoying this one.London Noir had me gripped from the first few pages.It was a very fast paced Thriller that I literally couldn't put down!It was chilling, dark, a lil sinister, full of suspense, highly addictive, with all the added twists and Turns that kept me turning the pages till the early morning!Who is Sophie??When Kal knocks Sophie over in the pouring rain whilst on her way to the hospital. There is something endearing and haunting about Sophie. Who is she running away from in the rain and why??Kal drops Sophie off at a well known lady of the night area that is full of danger.\u00a0But she just can't get Sophie out of her head! However Kal is about to discover Sophie has a dark past, nothing is as it seems, and why is it that everywhere Sophie goes it seems to equal murder and death!Who is Sophie??Kal isn't as innocent as she comes across, she too is hiding dark secrets!!With links to the underworld Cartel, it's hardly surprising she's a ruthless and very clever risk taker that will stop at nothing to help Sophie!!But how far will she go?? And to what risks??Kal's Best friend Marty has just come out of a coma and she is determined to protect Kal from Sophie. But is it a little too late?I absolutely adored Kal, Sophie and Marty.Such a fantastic dynamic between them.I loved Kal's strength and kick ass attitude. Sophie's uneasy and unnerving behaviour, yet somewhat childish and endearing.Marty's protective nature and the rational one.Ann does a fantastic job at weaving Kal's\u00a0 inner most thoughts and training to get her out of situations. I literally felt like I was with Kal. Very Exciting!!I also loved how Ann gave the reader glimpses of the past and into the mind of a dark and very twisted/ sinister character.Who by the way I had absolutely no clue as to the identity of the mystery character was!Not one clue as to whether the person was male or female.... Brilliant!! I love being kept guessing!So exciting!!! I think London Noir is definitely one to watch out for. Strong female Lead Characters, a great story line that has exciting little twists and turns to keep you hooked, a dark thriller with a Physcological feel, it's jam packed full of action that will leave you wanting more.One thing to mention it does contain a few violent scenes which does tie into the genre and storyline. I highly recommend this book if you love Thrillers, Suspense, Crime, Chilling addictive reads! I received this book from the Publisher in exchange for a honest and fair review in which I voluntarily reviewed.Check out my Review on my blog website:https://dashfan81.blogspot.com/2017/1..."}, {"userName": "Sandy *The world could end while I was reading and I would never notice*", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30817744-sandy-the-world-could-end-while-i-was-reading-and-i-would-never-notice", "userReview": "EXCERPT: I suppose the realization I was different stole up on me slowly. There were signs from early on, if I 'm honest. Like my first year in primary school when Mirabella wet her knickers in front of the whole class - the girls were mortified and the boys laughed and I was excited. So, yeah, I knew I was different. To survive, I learned to act like my friends and I 'm so good, pretty much everyone in my life would say I'm normal and I like that because it means I'm clever. One thing I've learned is that when you've wanted something for a long time, your mind makes tracks in the sand showing exactly how it's going to turn out. You anticipate your own excitement, your own arousal, and what the other person will say and do. Those tracks start out delicate and then solidify with each replaying of the fantasy, until they get to be as firm as a rail track. The fantasy can keep me occupied for months only, at some point, I have to have the real deal - the flash of horror in their eyes, the desperate urge to plead for mercy, bowels voiding and dribbling down a leg. It's the helplessness that grabs me - when they realize there's absolutely nothing they can do. It's the best drug in the world. And with me, it's the eyes that are captivating. The windows of the soul - unable to lie in the final moments. THE BLURB: Memory loss, nightmares, the urge to kill \u2013 Sophie has it all. Is it Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder? Or something more sinister? Kal is about to find out\u2026After a near-fatal road accident, Kal helps a young girl in trouble. The girl\u2019s friends are being murdered one by one. Why? And who by?Kal must kick start herself out of her downward spiral to save the young stranger.But Kal is in the grip of the London Cartel and is someone after the girl, or is the girl after someone?Crime suspense thriller. A stand alone novel. The second in the Kal Medi series. MY THOUGHTS: I hadn't read Kal Medi #1 before reading London Noir by Ann Girdharry. I think it would have helped, as there are numerous references to events that occurred in that first book that are not adequately explained, like what had happened to put Marty in hospital in a coma or why Kal was in the grip of the London Cartel. So I don't really recommend this as a stand alone book. But if you do read London Noir without reading Good Girl, Bad Girl, then chances are you will do what I am doing, and lay your hands on a copy of #1 anyway. Ann Girdharry had me hooked from the beginning. In fact at the 7% mark my comment was 'WOW!'. Of course, this frenetic pace could not be maintained although London Noir continued to be a fast paced book and a quick read. And while I didn't always find Kal's actions believable or at all rational, I was happy to suspend belief and just enjoy the read. 3.5 stars for London Noir by Ann Girdharry Thank you to author Ann Girdharry for providing me with a digital copy of London Noir for review.

I did find some of things that Kat did or said a bit irrational at times but hey ho, shes a woman right.Nevertheless, as a rational woman myself it did leave me humfing at times.IMAGINEYou just hear that your best friend has woken from a coma, you want to rush off to the hospital, of course you do, [to find out how she got in that state, you need to read book 1] Kat runs to her car and begins driving, its wet weather and on route she almost runs over a young woman. This woman's name is Sophie.After finding our if shes OK, she is still worried about this stranger named Sophie and offers her a lift to her home.But, Sophie doesn't want to be dropped off at home, she wants to be dropped off at an undesirable red light district. That is where my high hopes dropped a bit as I didn't feel this realistic, well, not something I would have done, but you need to draw your own conclusions here.Then Kat later discovers there is a killer on the loose and the women he has killed are connected with Sophie, so now she is even more worried about her.Get ready for some tummy churning moments as the killers gory happenings are unfolded and described in horrific detail upon the pages.My personal thoughts are that some things were hard to believe, some things needed more pace and pitch and power. I didn't find it a page turner, I did find it a slow burner and not an edge of your seat thriller, and sometimes that's a good thing. The plot was a good one but the way Sophie was introduced and how Kat was so 'worried' about a stranger was so hard for me to understand fully.I enjoyed book 1 much better."}, {"userName": "Zoe", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18237582-zoe", "userReview": "3.5 stars. Action-packed, suspenseful, and eerie!In this latest novel by Girdharry, London Noir, Kal Medi is back and not only struggling to recover from all the physical and psychological trauma she suffered on her last investigation but quickly caught up in the life of a troubled girl whose skeletons both past and present may be more harrowing than anyone expected.The writing style is descriptive and smooth. The plot is an incredibly twisty tale that delves into a world filled with deception, mental illness, obsession, manipulation, revenge, malice, violence, and murder.\u00a0\u00a0And the characters are multi-layered, scarred, and somewhat impetuous.London Noir is the second book in the Kal Medi series and even though I felt the main character's motivations were a little hard to grasp at times and it wasn't quite as dark and gritty as the first novel it is still a very entertaining, enjoyable thriller that highlights Girdharry's extraordinary\u00a0knowledge of the human psyche.Thank you to Ann Girdharry for providing me with a copy in exchange for an honest review.All my reviews can be found on my blog at https://whatsbetterthanbooks.com"}, {"userName": "Sean Peters", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14058345-sean-peters", "userReview": "I purchased this book to read this book for a Read A long with my group for the month of November.Firstly I think it is best to mention it can be read as a stand alone, but I feel it is best to read the first book, sadly I did not and I think it would have made this book better.Memory loss, nightmares, the urge to kill \u2013 Sophie has it all.

It was the second in a series about a kick ass woman named Kal. I read it as a stand alone and though it started and finished a complete storyline I think background on the characters from the first book would have enhanced it. I loved how the author made such strong, smart, likable women main characters. The plot was also good with some tense twists to it. The ending wrapped up the story, but I can see that these characters and some of the minor ones will be up for more adventures when the author writes the next installment of the series.

I was happy to see a 2nd from Ann Girdharry and couldn\u2019t wait to see what Kal would get up to this time. She helps out a young girl called Sophie who has a lot going on in her past & present life. This story leads us into what happens after she helps out & what builds between them.

Don\u2019t worry, no spoilers here!I love a good thriller and I really enjoy getting into the nitty gritty of the characters. I enjoyed the pace and rhythm of the book. I especially loved the fact I could pick it up and put it down without losing the flow and it was great to read a couple of chapters at a time in between a really hectic and chaotic couple of weeks. I was a little unsure to start with about the jumping around between points of view, but then as I read on I realised it added to the intrigue and it drew me in further. I read this after reading Good Girl Bad Girl (the first Kal Medi novel) and I do believe that this book would stand alone as a great read even if I hadn\u2019t. I do love the way the characters evolved over the two books and how Ann write the complexities of the relationships between them. I thoroughly enjoy it when I become emotionally invested in a character and I find myself at the end of the book having been on a huge rollercoaster of emotions and unexpected reactions to a few of the characters in the book. A thoroughly good read that makes me wish that book #3 was already available.

This book is, again, well written and we are taken on fast, eventful journey as Kal tries to unravel the mystery surrounding Sophie. I wanted to know what happened but didn't enjoy this sequel as much as the first book. I found Kal reckless to the point of finding her a bit irritating and she wasn't quite so believable this time round. I kept asking myself why she would have done x when she put herself and others in danger because she had misjudged the situation. For someone who is supposed to an expert at reading people she got it wrong time and again.

Who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nWhat they left behind was a different Kal.\n\nI\u2019d say lost rather than different. Everything that made her who she was, either psychologically or physically, has been shaken and I felt there was a hole Kal was trying to fill. It\u2019s the reason why I decided to buy the \u201ctake any danger for a stranger you just met\u201d decisions. Because I was used to the calculating, strong and lonely spirit of the old Kal and because I would never put myself in the place our main character decides to go so early in the story! I needed a reason to make sense of her weird behavior, so I blamed it all on the shock of what had happened to help me find some realism. I can say it\u2019s the niggle I had throughout the story. Even though the action flows smoothly, I couldn\u2019t fathom the reasons why we had been brought to this from the start. But I\u2019m well placed to know psychological scars make you do things that don\u2019t sound like you, so I went on with it.\n\nSince when is a friend someone you can\u2019t trust?\n\nSophie is a very special character. Everything around her is blurry, her story only snippets of a life you can\u2019t grasp, and it kept me on my toes the entire time. Her dependency on Kal was unsettling, as if something was wrong. You know, when you walk and there\u2019s a little pebble in your shoe, but you keep on going? That was my feeling with Sophie. The more Kal unearthed information about the young girl, the less I trusted her, but instead of creating tension, the same pattern of not knowing left me cold for the poor girl, and wondering what the hell was happening with Kal. I wanted answers, but I did not feel a real rush of urgency or danger.\n\nWhere you find emotion, you glean information, and the stronger the emotions, the more suppressed messages seep through the cracks.\n\nThe story delve into something I find extremely fascinating and scary. Mental issues, a constant dread of not being able to trust your own thoughts, and how to live with it. The author sheds light on the scars traumas can leave behind them, how deep they can run, and how some people learn how to play with it. This side of the story was exceptionally well-written, and my favorite part about the book! Kal has to face what she is, what she wants to be, and make decisions she\u2019s been postponing for too long. I enjoyed the thread that linked the first book to the second.On top of a stranger to save, Kal has to pay a debt. We do like our characters to be busy, right? I appreciated the fact Kal struggled with herself, her emotions, and her actions during London Noir, the confidence that could make her come off as cocky showing signs of weaknesses, allowing me to get a little closer to the character. Every aspect of the psychological state of every character is explored, and this is what makes the series special.I was happy the secondary characters weren\u2019t forgotten, banished to the never-to-be-heard-again prison! Marty is definitely my favorite character, and Kal\u2019s best asset! I won\u2019t spoil anything but sometimes, it\u2019s hard to have such a dark and complicated best friend!!!\nOverall, London Noir combines a trip into the human mind to self-discovery with a sharp and clinical writing, through action and blood, throwing one question after another to the reader!"}, {"userName": "Kaisha (The Writing Garnet)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40776578-kaisha-the-writing-garnet", "userReview": "All reviews can be found on my blog at https://thewritinggarnet.wordpress.comHaving read the first book in the Kal Medi series a while ago, I was a bit concerned that I wouldn\u2019t be able to follow all of the events in the latest book. I needn\u2019t have worried however, as despite \u2018London Noir\u2019 being part of a series, the storyline was written so that it could be read as a standalone perfectly fine. You don\u2019t HAVE to read the first book in the series as it does read fine on its own. However, I think that to understand Kal\u2019s personality one hundred percent, as well as being able understand hers and Marty\u2019s friendship better, I would advise you read \u2018Good Girl Bad Girl\u2019 first.Let\u2019s get straight to the point \u2013 I was absolutely gripped by the latest Kal Medi instalment! So much so I was able to read the book with no interruptions in 2.5 hours. It\u2019s safe to say that I didn\u2019t put the book down! If you\u2019ve read Ann Girdharry\u2019s books, you\u2019ll no doubt agree that once you pop, you just can\u2019t stop. It certainly was the case where this book was concerned, that\u2019s for sure!It was interesting to see a different side to Kal as in the previous book emotion didn\u2019t seemed to be part of her vocabulary, yet in this book she seemed to think with her heart \u2013 much to Marty\u2019s concern! The only real irk i had about this book was the situation with Raphael. I could understand the need for it in the storyline as a distraction, but I couldn\u2019t seem to work out the point of Raphael being part of the storyline overall. Personally, I felt that everything would have still worked if that part was no longer included in the story. I really couldn\u2019t see the point. It felt as though Raphael was just there to fill up some word space. Don\u2019t get me wrong, his character annoyed me something chronic and I understood the need for debt repayment but apart from that\u2026I enjoyed the thrill and suspenseful nature of the storyline, it did keep me guessing and when the loose ends started to get tied up, i had several \u2018ooooohhh yeah!!\u2019 moments. Up until that moment, however, I couldn\u2019t pinpoint \u2018whodunnit\u2019 if it stared me in the face. Well\u2026.it did kinda, didn\u2019t it!In all honesty, I found \u2018Good Girl Bad Girl\u2019 to be a lot more gut wrenchingly intense than this book, however, I still thoroughly enjoyed \u2018London Noir\u2019 and I would recommend this book and the entire series in a heartbeat.Thanks Rararesources."}, {"userName": "Abbie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50638987-abbie", "userReview": "London Noir is the second book in Girdharry\u2019s Kal Medi series, following on from Good Girl Bad Girl which was published last year. While London Noir does work as a standalone, it is better to have read Good Girl Bad Girl firstly because you will get more of a sense of Kal\u2019s history and secondly because it\u2019s a cracking read.When Kal is involved in a road traffic accident with a young woman called Sophie she is immediately drawn to her \u2026 and subsequently drawn into Sophie\u2019s dangerous life. Sophie\u2019s friends are being killed and Kal helps her to find out who is responsible and why.I really liked the character of Kal in the first book and knew this would be a protagonist I wanted to follow. She is a kick-arse, gutsy, intelligent photo-journalist with an interesting background, thanks in part to her father who her taught her all about understanding body language and how to read and manipulate people. In this second book we see a softer and more vulnerable side to Kal. This makes me like her even more and there is plenty of scope for Girdharry to continue with this character and I look forward to seeing how Kal develops as the series progresses. London Noir draws you in immediately with a first chapter that captures your attention and leaves you wanting to know more. From there the pace gradually gains momentum and you become completely gripped. The plot is fast-moving and keeps the reader of their toes with twists and turns galore making London Noir a thrilling ride. The killer in London Noir may well be the most evil, chilling antagonist I have come across this year! Punctuated with chapters in which the killer narrates in first person, Girdharry ensures that the reader\u2019s attention is maintained throughout. I loved getting an insight into what makes the killer tick but bloomin\u2019 heck it sent shivers down my spine as it is as creepy as hell!What I really like about this series is the use of psychology and body language that Girdharry incorporates. This adds an additional layer and there is an intelligence in Girdharry\u2019s books that make them stand apart from other crime thrillers.If you haven\u2019t yet checked out the Kal Medi series yet I strongly suggest you do. Current, unnerving, well cast and plotted, London Noir is a must for crime fiction fans."}, {"userName": "Chris Nolan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49125698-chris-nolan", "userReview": "I am very grateful to the author for letting me have an advance copy of London Noir; it is the follow-up to the first Kal Medi novel but I read it as a stand-alone. Kal and her friend Marty work together to solve crimes, Kal sometimes employing questionable methods while Marty is rather more conventional. At the start of this book Marty has been in a coma for months and is now awake, and as Kal rushes to the hospital she almost collides with Sophie, a troubled young woman who divides her time between a mental institution and a brothel. Her parents are dead and her half-brother is trying to locate her. Kal is determined to unravel the mysteries of Sophie's life while also dealing with questions over her own parents. I would like to have started at the beginning and shall now go back to fill in gaps. A very enjoyable read!"}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44068050-kate", "userReview": "Can you remember a book you read last August? I can, it was Good Girl Bad Girl. This was the prequel to London Noir which features Kal Medi, a photo journalist turned sleuth as she tried to track down her mother who had gone missing. For the full picture I would recommend reading the books in order, and it gives a great insight into Kal as a character.I want to avoid speaking about the plot too much, the usual fear of spoilers and giving anything too juicy away but I will say that this book features one of the most chilling serial killers I\u2019ve read about in a long time. Girdharry paints a stunning picture of a killer who can charm and beguile, is clever but also can kill without remorse. The narration from the perspective of the killer is absolutely chilling and really had me creeped out at times.Kal has also changed between the books, perhaps the events from the previous book have taken their toll on her, but she comes across as less sure of herself, she\u2019s wounded from fights and has witnessed things that have left scars mentally. This in turn makes her a little easier for readers to connect with, almost as if it takes her being vulnerable so that readers can empathise with her. In spite of all of this, she has lost none of her intelligence and inquisitive mind, which makes for fascinating and enjoyable reading.The author\u2019s knowledge and experience in the field of psychology shines through in her writing, the details given on the topics of post traumatic stress disorder and the psychopath give this a credibility as well as being interesting reading. Ann Girdharry knows how to write a fast paced thriller with plenty of action that has readers racing through the chapters, and she has certainly pulled out all the stops with London Noir. A side note, some readers of a nervous disposition might feel a wee bit uncomfortable with the descriptions of some of the injuries suffered by the victims in this book, they\u2019re not overly graphic but I reckon it\u2019s only fair to let you have a heads up.An excellent follow up to Good Girl Bad Girl and I look forward to seeing what Ann writes next!"}, {"userName": "Freda Mans-Labianca", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2967441-freda-mans-labianca", "userReview": "Closure for the first book.All the things that you felt left hung in Good Girl Bad Girl were answered and put to rest in this book. I did love that, and the new plot too, as well as feeling it's complete.If Kal Medi is in a third book, it would HAVE to be a new plot, story and everything. No questions were left raised in book 2.It was more exciting for me, and that is rare for a second book to better than the first. I feel that was as this story had a beginning, middle and end, where the first book wasn't like that at all.Really good stuff together though!! I know many of you will enjoy reading about Kal Medi and all that she gets herself into."}, {"userName": "Kelly (purplebookstand)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12145523-kelly-purplebookstand", "userReview": "London NoirHaving read the first book in the Kal Medi series, I was eager to get my hands on the next instalment! It\u2019s important to note that although this is part of a series, it can be read as a standalone but I would recommend you read Good Girl, Bad Girl first to get some background information. London Noir joins Kal as she has become determined to help a young girl who she met completely by chance when she nearly knocked her down. Kal becomes increasingly concerned about Sophie but the more she finds out, the more she is confused, is Sophie the hunter, or the hunted?This is another cracking read from Ann Girdharry that had me gripped from start to finish. It\u2019s a fast paced thriller that is full of tension and suspense. I really couldn\u2019t put this book down, I was so engrossed that I finished the book and then saw it was gone 3am and I hadn\u2019t even realised! I really enjoyed London Noir and I\u2019ll now eagerly anticipate book three in this fab series. (No pressure Ms Girdharry!) Five stars from purplebookstand.

Sadly I haven\u2019t read the first so I did feel a little lost at some points through London Noir but it didn\u2019t spoil the enjoyment of the book, if anything it made me more eager to read the first and find out what happened.Kal is in her car rushing to get to the hospital to see her friend Marty when she nearly collides with a young girl. After making sure Sophie is ok and dropping her at an undesirable part of the city, Kal can\u2019t help worrying about Sophie and decides to try to track her down. This is when the mystery begins and we find there\u2019s a killer on the loose.Kal was a really interesting character, her ability to read people fascinated me. She\u2019s a tough cookie but also has a vulnerable side to her which made her feel quite realistic. Sophie was a great character too, having been sent to an institution by her step-brother after her parents were murdered, she spends her time either there on at the brothel where she feels safe\u00a0. That is until Lady Penelope is murdered in a very gruesome way.\u00a0This was a really interesting read, it\u2019s gruesome in parts but it really had me turning the pages. I was desperately trying to guess who the killer was, but failed miserably. With a fantastic plot that had my heart racing and great characters, I thoroughly enjoyed London noir and I can\u2019t wait to go and read book one and hopefully the series will continue for a long time to come.
