It centers around 4 families that live as neighbors in a cul-de-sac. While each family is in every book, each book focuses on one family and a particular struggle they are going through.

I couldn't go to bed without finishing this vivid, thought provoking, real life story. The characters in this novel are just like you and me or our neighbours down the street. This novel proves what the power of prayer can do! I can't wait to get into the sequel of this novel in the morning!! :o)From dust jacket:Tory Sullivan struggles with the demands of motherhood and her desire for a career.

Each book was good in and of itself. This book falls under \"Christian Fiction,\" and while I believe there are elements that non-Christians or non-practicing Christians, or people who find conservative Christianity bothersome that are in this book, I do believe if you can look past that, this story is most definitely worth the read. It deals with a group of 4 women - all very different, both in the places in their life as well as their level of belief. Note - each of the 4 books in the series focus on a different neighbor. This one dealt with one neighbor who was dealing with a serious illness of her child. Not a typical reader of Christian fiction (I don't like the in your face message), this series is not something I would pick. Perhaps the reason I like this series is the very real nature that the authors deal with the relationship. It speaks in a very truthful way about friendship and love and the importance of a neighborhood. It is very similar to the style of Debbie Macomber (who I LOVE), so fans of hers will appreciate this book and/or series."}, {"userName": "Delinda Mauney", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27440870-delinda-mauney", "userReview": "This books was really good. I had read several books in this series many years ago but missed this one somehow. I loved the series and the writings by Beverly LaHaye and Terri Blackstock. The stories in this series are about a close knit neighborhood who all know each other and share family problems and are there to help each other out in all circumstances. This book is particularly about a family whose son becomes very ill and how the family pulled together and the neighborhood came to grips with a lot of things during this time that they found inportant. It tells of how the mother in this is a church going Christian and the father is not. During this illness it brings this family closer together and shows how our God is amazing and can do all things, all we have to do is have faith. Finally the father in the story understands.A good read with several twists and turns but shows us how in this busy world today, we loose so much by not having the closeness with friends and neighbors."}, {"userName": "Ashley Newton", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32404612-ashley-newton", "userReview": "This book had me in tears, but it was soo good and encouraging."}, {"userName": "Saskia", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9646861-saskia", "userReview": "Een mooi geschreven christelijke roman wat erg makkelijk en vlot wegleest. In het begin had ik wel even moeite met alle personages die op me afkwamen. Buiten de 4 buurvrouwen en hun mannen heb je namelijk ook alle kinderen van hen die je leert kennen.In dit boek gaat het over het zoontje van Brenda. Hij is ernstig ziek en heeft dringend een nieuw hart nodig. Mooi om te lezen hoe de gemeenschap alles op alles zetten om de ziektekosten voor Joseph bij elkaar te krijgen. Wel vond ik het boek erg veel over de kerken en bidden gaan. Dat stond me op een gegeven moment wel wat tegen of ik heb de laatste tijd teveel boeken in dit genre gelezen, waardoor ik het eventjes gehad heb met het geloof. Dat kan natuurlijk ook ;-)Ik ben wel van plan om de overige delen binnenkort te gaan lezen, want ik ben benieuwd naar de verhalen over de andere buurvrouwen!"}, {"userName": "Pauline", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5381880-pauline", "userReview": "We all are in one season of life or another or passing from one to the next. This book explores a neighborhood full of different seasons. The book provided not only a good story but something to think about. Although at times it got pretty \"preachy\" there was truth brought out. The tragedy of a severely ill child was the unifying situation around which all the issues hung. It's true such trials make us face things we've tried to ignore or places where we need to grow.) Good message for everyone but maybe not a format that would appeal to everyone."}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51647109-cathy", "userReview": "I enjoyed the conversations in this book, and thought it was funny that each of the four women envied the others their situation in life, not knowing the truths in those lives, and not looking for contentment in their own lives. The single lady envied the married moms and vice versa. The woman who wanted time away from her kids envied the mom with grown kids and vice versa.

The plot is a good one, but it is far to maudlin and unreal in places.
