As another reviewer pointed out, the decision to remove the sample pages feature most assuredly increases the chances of finding oneself staring in dismay at a literary pig in a poke. Such is the case here, for me.The first chapter is overwrought and overwritten, full of italics and angst, and failed to show me the alleged panic and terror this woman\u2014we assume she is a female\u2014feels chained in a cell in the dark. And that is the problem: I don\u2019t see this; I am told it is happening. That sort of amateurish writing jerks the literary rug from beneath any novel, especially one billed as \u201csuspense.\u201dThe second chapter, by contrast, is an amazingly pedestrian account of the main character\u2019s promotion, her repeated thoughts of uncertainty about handling her \u201cteam leader\u201d status, and then the muddled decision by her group of nondescript friends to celebrate their long friendship by a vacation on Crete. The presentation of the characters, including What\u2019s-er-Name, the intended damsel in distress, was as exciting as cardboard, and about as developed. I rolled my eyes, and plowed on, not caring much about these people.And then here we are, back to the italics and the telling panic\u2014pun intended\u2014as the damsel in distress continues to wonder what exactly got her into her present pickle. I laughed at the prose, and plowed on.Let\u2019s end this now, shall we? I skimmed the last two-thirds of this book because that was the best I could do besides deleting it without finishing. I admit to a certain faint fascination, a slight curiosity to see if it got better, or if the plot veered off onto the road less traveled. But alas. The tale did not improve, the writing remained in stasis between purple and dull, and the plot remained true to a trope that has almost been done to death. In more skilled hands, perhaps I might have been inclined to offer a better opinion of this book.\"Award-winning author?\" Really? As far as I can see, just another overhyped scribbler wo fails to deliver much at all."}, {"userName": "Suze", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26071136-suze", "userReview": "LiesMy Kindle First Read choice for May- it is listed as Suspense, but I think it's more of a psychological thriller.

I tortured myself over whether it was a 3 or 4 star book, in the end I rounded down to 3 stars, but it was marginal.The plot is good and fairly novel. There are twists, but to be honest I could see the outline of the climax and pretty much guessed the culprits from a little over halfway through. Some of the lesser twists were a bit of a surprise, but that predictability (for me at least - maybe I've read too many mysteries and psychological thrillers) is the main reason I rounded down instead of up.The characters....hmmm. I actually like the main protagonist, Jan. Perversely, I like the fact that she is inherently unlikable, a compulsive liar who sabotages her own life and those around her with her fabrications. I like her despite that because of her self awareness, the fact she hates herself for it and wishes she were different. I feel the other characters, though, are a little thin; not exactly two dimensional, but not really fleshed out enough to form an attachment, even Marcus, the closest Jan has to a co-conspirator. Some of the characters are decidedly unlikable, but that's how the author wants them to be. Maybe a little overdone in some cases, but that's okay, I get it. Gretchen, I could do without and really don't see the point in her. I just found her irritating from start to finish.Some reviewers have complained that the book verges on a mythology history lesson at times, but I don't mind that, and while not integral to the plot, it does at least give some character to the setting and plays into the psychological mindset of some characters in their ordeals.Overall, I'm probably making this a 3.49 star book. So nearly 4 stars but not quite. I did enjoy it, and I would read more from the author for sure. I could see it being a great holiday read, sitting by the pool (though maybe not in Crete!). Just a couple of minor frailties keeping it fractionally south of the border for me."}, {"userName": "RedRedtheycallmeRed", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16123194-redredtheycallmered", "userReview": "2.5 STARSIt's revealed fairly early in the book that Jan is a liar, she lies about big things, she lies about inconsequential things. She's aware of this, yet acts affronted when people don't believe her. The book opens with Jan being shackled to a wall, her memory foggy. Then it flashes back to her arrival in Greece. It goes back and forth, but the present chapters were much more interesting, as the stakes are much higher. The flashback chapters are longer (sometimes too long), filled with one unlikable character after another. They pretty much drink all day and throw vague insults (and the occasional menacing look) at each other.This book reminded me of \"In a Dark, Dark Wood\", but it didn't grab me in the same way (not nearly as atmospheric)."}, {"userName": "Lisa Dicus", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57409150-lisa-dicus", "userReview": "Gripping!!!Gripping, can't put the kindle down, read.

The overall story, while formulaic for mystery and psychological suspense books, had parts that were different and made this book \"hold its own.\" I finished the book feeling as if the ending was good and not totally expected.

The story revolves around lies and secrets that are revealed as the story progresses. I had a hard time putting down this book because I was constantly making my own theories about how this might end, and I couldn't wait to see if I was right. You know from the first chapter that something very wrong is happening, as we find the protagonist, Jan, chained and locked in a dark room and unable to remember the events that lead to this. From there the chapters alternate between the story leading up to the first chapter and \"prisoner Jan\" as she starts to recall them herself. The book had some interesting twists and I enjoyed the setting in Crete with Greek mythology references. This is not an action-packed thriller and some of the characters are not likable, so I can see how it might not be for everyone, but I definitely enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "E.C.

(And I'm normally a harsh critic).This is a story about lying.The main character lies to both us the readers and the other characters, and yet, she does share with us her true feelings that she hides from the other character, so we sort of trust her and yet we don't. I love characters that are multi-dimensional and have obvious flaws. I love the idea that this book references a lot of Greek mythology, which you can argue, are also lies. Stories that aren't real, but are meant to teach us something about ourselves.The constant side stories of mythology (hiding Baby Zeus from his father) and World War II (The Allies protecting the city of Alexandria) emphasize the use of misdirection for a greater purpose. Again, more lying, but interesting moral dilemma: Is it wrong? In this context, no. The dynamic of the group, the six \"good friends\" is also riddled with quirks and words and actions that are inconsistent with true friendships. Again, more lying to each other about what they actually think of one another.All of these things are really cool ways to integrate the theme but make it relevant to the reader. I also thought he tells the story of Jan's imprisonment chillingly well. Like I feel other authors glance over this - the girl wakes up, she's chained up in a basement and she has an escape plan after 2 paragraphs. Jan methodically goes over different scenarios and tries different things to find freedom - it made me there in the room doing those same things. I am currently very cranky at work because I stayed up far too late last night finishing the book.

This also seemed to grab my fingernails, because several are now mere nubs, when I am sure I had a full set at the start of the book. I loved the weaving of mythology and location into the story. Mr Hart blended a intriguing tale of friendship, betrayal, and regaining of trust, along with the additional element of danger.

But instead of the fun days she remembers, this time the atmosphere within the group is tense. When she wakes up chained to a wall in a dark cell, she must try to remember how she got there, and piece together a darker secret from five years ago.I got this through Amazon First Reads, so fortunately it was free. The writing itself is average, and the plot is nothing new or spectacular. There's nothing this novel does that others don't do better, but it's not horrible. I might have at least kind of liked it if not for the characters.The characterization in this is just lazy. The two couples are basically carbon copies of each other--the women are beautiful, rich, the centers of attention, while the guys are just sort of jerks. Those are essentially their most notable traits. Gretchen, Jan, and Marcus do stand out from the others, but aren't particularly interesting and are annoying in their own right. Jan is a pathological liar, and at a times it seems like this is a tactic to make her an unreliable narrator, but it's poorly done. Her lying really just ensures that no one else in the group believes her. If you want a book that does it better, try The Girl on the Train. And another thing that bothered me the whole time: Andrew Hart doesn't know how poor vision works. Jan loses her glasses in the ocean on the first day and makes a big deal about being \"blind as a bat,\" yet most of the time has no issue seeing things. She'll throw in occasional comments about not being able to see and needing to bring her watch an inch away from her face to read it, yet has no problem seeing people's facial expressions and can somehow see from her third floor window that the gate all the way at the end of the drive is cracked open a bit. As a nearsighted person... that isn't how it works, and there was actually no point in her losing her glasses as far as I can tell. Perhaps a nitpicky complaint, but is continuity regarding the main character's eyesight really so hard? Overall, mediocre with below average character development.
