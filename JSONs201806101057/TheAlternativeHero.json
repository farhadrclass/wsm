Using a fictional band as the focal point (which is kinda smart since the reader can then input thier own favorite band to a certain extent), Thornton takes the reader on both a love-letter excursion through the era's English music scene and the pan the protagonist took to end up a 30-something with a dead-end job, still obsessed with a band who broke up years ago.For an American reader there is one problem--many of the bands Thornton talks about never went beyond England, so I've never heard of them, even though I'm fairly well versed in music. But no matter, the story still resonates."}, {"userName": "Debs", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3099587-debs", "userReview": "I think Thorton has read a lot of Douglas Coupland. The narrative feels Coupland-esque, which is probably why I enjoyed it. The novel is about a mid-thirties music aficionado whose love for music is permanently stuck in the early 90s with grunge. He runs into a hero of his, an aging, hiding rock star, and sets up a friendship under false pretences. As expected, everything eventually comes out in the open but the character\u2019s motivations and his bumblings are both understandable and full of schadenfreude."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3324267-kim", "userReview": "I really wanted to like this book! Great concept with poor execution. Much of it reads like a history book of the fictional Thieving Magpies thanks to the band-obsessed boring Clive Beresford. For me, the book's major problem is that the characters are underdeveloped. Too bad, b/c I never really grew to care about them. In turn, the story is not compelling, the hijinks only mildly interesting, and the ending cheesey and disappointing. This was the author's first novel, maybe his next will be better. He has potential. The book has its dry humor moments."}, {"userName": "Woody Chandler", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1026784-woody-chandler", "userReview": "Ah, wotta classic example of why I should (almost) NEVER listen to others' recommendations. I trust a few people, but most people's recommendations of what I should read ends up on the rubbish heap of existence, unless well-justified. Sometimes, I can suss out who is on the mark and otherwise. In this case, I was caught in a weak moment & took a Goodreads recommendation! Grrr. Wotta mistake.This was like a knock-off of the much-better Nick Hornby with an unreliable narrator. Pssshh. The author even invokes Hornby at (at least) one point & I felt like chucking the whole bit. I slogged on, but that is all that it amounted to - a slog. I was a part of the punk/alternative scene from my exposure in 1983 until I just kind of fell out of love with it about a decade later.

Self-destructive behavior led to the dissolution of the band.Alan Potter- One year older than Clive, but 'hipper' and more successful. He and Clive traveled all over the UK to cover the English Alternative Musical Scene.Billy Flushing- One year younger than Clive, and much less 'hip', yet he achieves more success than either of the three classmates.Gloria Feathers- Maven of the scene, and an artistic influence on all of the bands. Girlfriend of Lance Webster.A terrific coming-of-age novel which deals with writing, friendship, career, and although the story is set in 2007, the focus is on the alternative music scene of late 80's and early 90's Great Britain. Clive Beresford is adrift in his life, and unnaturally obsessed with The Thieving Magpies, an alternative band from the late 80's. He feels that this band virtually wrote the soundtrack to his life, and one day, to his total amazement, he finds that Lance Webster, lead singer of the band, lives just down the street from him. But, Webster is 'exclusively reclusive', and will not submit to an interview, so Clive must get creative. The novel is the story of the developing friendship between these two men. While reading this book it is crucial to hit Wikipedia numerous times to learn of the many bands that were part of this very creative musical scene. I guess many would find the massive interaction of so many musical acts tedious or off-putting, however the real story is the growing interaction between the two men. Although I am a fan of the music, I think that it would be possible to enjoy this novel if you were indifferent to the musical setting.THE THIEVING MAGPIES are a fictional band, yet the author, Tim Thornton has written a complete discography which he includes at the end of the novel."}, {"userName": "Shana", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2643103-shana", "userReview": "Really enjoying this book. Set in London, the story revolves around 33 year old Clive, that followed the indy bands of the mid 80's to mid 90's (eg. Carter USM) but particularly the fictional Thieving Magpies. It turns out that the lead singer he idolised lives down the road from and he wants to know why it all turned sour and why he feels that those times were the best of his life. It's a lot of fun and is pretty funny because the author must have lived through this time because it's so authentic, the bands, the early festivals, the haunts, the gigs and the absolute rapture that can only come from loving going out and seeing bands and discussing every detail with your mates. As I led pretty much the same lifestyle back then it really appeals to me but I don't know if that would translate to a younger, older or reader that doesn't really know who or what this character is talking about. ADDENDUM - Now having finished it, I've come to the conclusion that it doesn't really matter if the reader doesn't know the bands or culture back then. Many of us has a period in time where the music was everything regardless of the era. I think what the crux of it is, as you follow Clive's narrrative to it's conclusion, is that as some point you have to stop pissing about and get on with it and over it."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/921457-shannon", "userReview": "When thirty-something, washed-up music writer Clive finds out that the lead singer of the (now defunct) Thieving Magpies, alt-rock god Lance Webster, has moved in down the street, he immediately begins scheming how to finagle a career reviving exclusive interview and find out what REALLY happened the night the Magpies broke up. Unfortunately, after a few too many drinks he writes a note, the contents of which he can no longer remember, and slips it under his idol's door. The next day, he is visited by two bouncer-types who tell him to never approach Mr. Webster again, or else.

Music makes you travel stupid distances to watch bands. Music makes you consider tearing your hair out if a friend or loved one insists on listening to Keane or Coldplay instead of some rare John Peel session by The Fall. Music is life. This book by Thornton may be set in a particular time period (early 90s Alternative Music scene in Britain before 'Britpop went and fucked everything up') but the way the main character Clive acts pretty much sums up the behaviour of any obsessed music fan. It\u2019s a great portrayal of what it means to love a band when your young and how hard it can be to grow up when everyone tells you too. It\u2019s about bands who had it then lost it and those who have been forgotten about by the media. Recommended for anyone who stayed up late listening to the radio just to hear a new song by their favourite artist, who spend hours trying to convince friends or even complete strangers they really need to check so and so out and have their live changed."}, {"userName": "Dan Phillips", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4856668-dan-phillips", "userReview": "As an anglophile music nerd fairly well-versed in 90's pre-Britpop indie music, this book was definitely a treat. It places a fictional band (Thieving Magpies) in the middle of that particular scene as a way to explore and launch tall tales from the era. However, what really pushed the book into the five-star range for me was the present-day story of the slacker journo stalking the former idol and, touchingly, actually become something of a close friend. More than that, the former lead singer of the Magpies almost takes the narrator under his wing, giving him the boost he needs to sort his life out and to let go of things like, well, idolizing a former idol. This is that rare book that's as sweet as it is snarky. I'd recommend it to music nerds especially, but even fans of, say, Nick Honrby's About a Boy.

Where Nick Hornby would have found a way to make this obsession feel like a universal story, this story instead feels very specific.
