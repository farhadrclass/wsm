It provides ways to differentiate in ways that I haven't considered. It provides a lot of research backing differentiation and strategies of differentiation that can easily be applied to the workshop classroom. Very current and informative research, well thought out text, and easy to read!"}, {"userName": "Cherith", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9084374-cherith", "userReview": "This book is overwhelming at first, even for someone who uses differentiation in her classroom, but it quickly becomes both inspiring and practical.

After teaching full time for two years, it became obvious that a one size fits all approach was not working. My advanced students were not being challenged. My students who were a little behind were not getting the specific guidance needed. This book gave me some great ideas on how to give each group what they needed. I would have liked more specific detail, but I don't think that was the purpose of this book. It is a great starting point and makes a good case for differentiation. I would have liked more examples of use in higher education (I don't recall any examples.) Overall, a good book that would help any teacher struggling to meet the needs of the different students in their classes."}, {"userName": "Shauntelle James", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3286817-shauntelle-james", "userReview": "In my younger years, I did not recognize the importance of creative learning until I attended Florida Atlantic. I thought the whole idea to be unconventional and uninfluential. It was not until I entered Intro to Business Writing that I surprised myself. I decided to read this book as further exploration. After reading it, the whole idea took on clarity and I realized how much I already knew. I learned how important creativity was in the role of been a differentiated teacher. Reading this also corrected some misconceptions about how differentiated teaching was not influential. I learned mostly from the teaching strategies and appliciations, like agendas, stations, orbitals, agendas, and learning contracts."}, {"userName": "Jessyca", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5551278-jessyca", "userReview": "A good refresher read, the second edition builds upon the first. As I step into a new role in the upcoming school year, I especially liked Chapter 10: Education Leaders as Catalysts for Differentiated Classrooms. It is so important to remember that there are so many complexities to the change process and it is difficult. It will take some finesse and some uplifting leadership to remind and teach people that differentiation is not only an instructional strategy or collection of strategies, but rather a way of teaching and learning that advocates for individuals. Teaching is an art and a science....that is for sure. Happy reading!"}, {"userName": "Jaime K", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13180341-jaime-k", "userReview": "This is a great book that provides many, many strategies, options, and tips for teachers to have classrooms that are differentiated. Tomlinson knows that teachers - and their educational leaders - have to start off small and not feel overwhelmed by all the possibilities. It's about what works for THEM as well as their students. The book isn't overly repetitious, and each chapter is short enough to not feel overbearing."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51755601-kelly", "userReview": "I know Tomlinson is a foremost expert in differentiation and I was excited to delve into a book rather than rely on articles. Unfortunately, I felt like this book was heavy on theory and light on practical examples. Perhaps because I have worked in schools where differentiation is expected already, I found the examples that she shared to be fairly common sense. I appreciated the refresher, but didn't feel like I learned much new information from the text."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5775253-carol", "userReview": "Great book for ALL school personnel. Definitely colleges of education programs should be using this book for pre-service teachers. Great for beginning teachers and those in current practice. Some of this is common sense, I think..... but, I know there are many who just don't \"get it\". Great review for those of us already implementing differentiation."}, {"userName": "Kinsey Underbrink", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45394305-kinsey-underbrink", "userReview": "Book was slow. author spent a lot of time talking about what differentiation is and why it's important.

And it\u2019s led by teachers under enormous pressure to help decidedly unstandardized students meet an expanding set of rigorous, standardized learning targets. In this updated second edition of her best-selling classic work, Carol Ann Tomlinson offers these teachers a powerful and practical way to meet a challenge that is both very modern and completely timeless: how to divide their time, resources, and efforts to effectively instruct so many students of various backgrounds, readiness and skill levels, and interests.With a perspective informed by advances in research and deepened by more than 15 years of implementation feedback in all types of schools, Tomlinson explains the theoretical basis of differentiated instruction, explores the variables of curriculum and learning environment, shares dozens of instructional strategies, and then goes inside elementary and secondary classrooms in nearly all subject areas to illustrate how real teachers are applying differentiation principles and strategies to respond to the needs of all learners. This book\u2019s insightful guidance on what to differentiate, how to differentiate, and why lays the groundwork for bringing differentiated instruction into your own classroom or refining the work you already do to help each of your wonderfully unique learners move toward greater knowledge, more advanced skills, and expanded understanding. Today more than ever, The Differentiated Classroom is a must-have staple for every teacher\u2019s shelf and every school\u2019s professional development collection.", "title": "The Differentiated Classroom: Responding to the Needs of All Learners, 2nd Edition", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22717267-the-differentiated-classroom", "average": 3.99, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1405272832l/22717267.jpg", "reviews": 18, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/41479.Carol_Ann_Tomlinson", "name": "Carol Ann Tomlinson"}], "type": ["Teaching", "Education", "Nonfiction", "Academic"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22717267-the-differentiated-classroom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21808220-the-differentiated-classroom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1063377.Differentiated_Classroom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/527600.Integrating_Differentiated_Instruction_and_Understanding_by_Design", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/831462.How_to_Differentiate_Instruction_in_Mixed_Ability_Classrooms", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9829975-leading-and-managing-a-differentiated-classroom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/73307.Fulfilling_the_Promise_of_the_Differentiated_Classroom"]}
