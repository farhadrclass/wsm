It's not edifying to have a woman left in the same pit she was in before the story started, and alone to boot. Her faith is mentioned, mentioned as being different, but the explanation of it is short and hazy and not edifying to us, nor does it share the exact state of her beliefs other than to say they are \"different.\"Second, she acknowledges \"I failed him just as much as he failed me.\" NO YOU DIDN'T. You didn't CHEAT on him and sleep with others and break your marriage vows. Their marriage was not her lone responsibility to uphold. He is the head of the household and thus the primary person responsible before God to maintain his marriage. Look at Hosea, for goodness' sake! Read the New Testament and study the different Greek words used for love. Just because the poor baby boy thought he needed some kind of emotional support in his marriage doesn't give him the right to physically break his solemn vow before God. We aren't supposed to expect our marriage partners to do the hard work for us. If he needed emotional help, he needed to hit his knees and find it in God--NOT in the arms of another woman.Third, the book ends on a sad note with no promise of a sequel. I've never been a lover of tragedies.

Things don't always go the way we might expect, or even hope for in life. To portray a different ending would be to fluff up the harsh realities that are the consequences of our actions. Every action we take in life directly influences the lives of others whether they are complicit in the sin, or not. Too often the innocent are hurt the most. And some things can never be made right no matter how hard we try.Ironically, I knew someone in the very same situation as the characters in this book. I can't be specific or it would be a spoiler. Let me just say that I found the ending to be very believable because the exact same thing happened to a friend of mine. They say truth is stranger than fiction. It would seem a bit too much of a coincidence if I hadn't known what happened to my friend by direct report. Any other ending would not have rung true to me. Bravo to the author for crafting a scenario that depicts what would really happen as opposed to what people wish would happen. I found even the internal dialog to be honest.This is a bit of a heart-wrenching and sobering read, but it was well-thought-out and also very well-written. I enjoyed it and highly recommend it to people who are tired of stories that have unrealistic themes. This is a story you can really sink your teeth into. Savor it. I know I did.Shadows of Hope will be released in April 2018. I was sent a review copy (ARC) from the author in exchange for an honest review. Most of the books I've started over the past two years I haven't finished. I can honestly say that I finished this one because it held my interest."}, {"userName": "Fiction Aficionado", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39426033-fiction-aficionado", "userReview": "As you might guess from the book\u2019s description, this is a pretty compelling story. It\u2019s well written, and it\u2019s a plot that you really want to see through to its conclusion once you\u2019ve started reading. That said, I wasn\u2019t sure how I would feel about the story until its very last pages. Aside from the obviously painful circumstances, my heart was tempted to wish for something my conscience couldn\u2019t sanction, and at times it seemed the story might be heading that way. Then, as the ending drew ever nearer with the biggest bombshell still waiting to drop on the characters, I wondered how on earth the story would have any kind of a resolution.As I reflect now, I think the only word for the ending is \u2018right\u2019; anything else would have been either unrealistic or bruising to my conscience. Hallmark, it\u2019s not, and some readers might be disappointed by the way the story concludes, but it will make you think. And the more I think about it, the more I\u2019m impressed by this story.First of all, it\u2019s presented from three different points-of-view. Marissa\u2019s point-of-view is written in the first person, whereas Colin\u2019s and Kaitlyn\u2019s points-of-view are written in the third person. This has the subtle effect of allowing the reader to identify with Marissa and her pain first and foremost, but also have insight into the secondary protagonists/antagonists, Colin and Kaitlyn.Secondly, the author did an exceptional job of making all three characters realistic. It would have been so easy to make Colin a two-dimensional villain, but he\u2019s more than the sum of his mistakes, grievous though they may be. And while Marissa is the innocent party in the fallout of the affair, she's not without blame in the breakdown of the marriage. I found their motivations understandable, even if they didn\u2019t excuse their actions, and their emotions complex and authentic.Kaitlyn stands in the middle ground, having made the unwise decision to enter into a relationship with her professor, but without the full knowledge of his situation. She\u2019s an unwitting antagonist\u2014a twenty-six-year-old woman who can\u2019t change the decisions that got her where she is, but who is determined to make the right decisions as she goes forward. As the friendship grows between her and Marissa\u2014and it\u2019s a lovely friendship\u2014waiting for the moment when they would realise their connection wound the tension tighter and tighter.This is the kind of story that takes you out of your comfort zone and lets you experience the mess that unwise decisions can lead to\u2014the kind of mess that leaves permanent stains. How do believers handle those kinds of situations, especially when at least one of the people involved ISN\u2019T a believer? Where do they find hope and strength to move forward? These are the kinds of questions you\u2019ll be pondering as you read this book, along with the \u2018if only\u2019s we can all learn from.I received a copy of this book from the publisher.

Had this been promoted by a non-Christian publishing company, I would not have considered it. However, the premise sounded fairly intriguing and I wanted to dip my toes into something outside my comfort level. With that being said, \u201cShadows of Hope\u201d just didn\u2019t really get off the ground with me. The drama, while expected given the subject matter, was in my opinion overdone, and the characters didn\u2019t resonate much with me. The narrative is divided between Marissa\u2014whose viewpoint is related in the first person\u2014her husband, Colin, and Kaitlyn, the \u201cother woman\u201d. I found it difficult at times to sympathize with Marissa because of her self-centered attitude toward her marriage and her sometimes unrealistic expectations overall. Colin didn\u2019t seem to have many redeeming features, while Kaitlyn is portrayed as an angelic figure. The way that these three interact throughout the novel does add a definite human interest aspect, but the plot seemed too drawn out. The faith element was present, but almost as a side note, or so it seemed for much of the story\u2019s duration. Granted, there was no profanity or sexual situations\u2014this was a clean read\u2014but faith was not as prominent an issue as I was expecting and hoping for. This was hard to reconcile with my expectations. I also anticipated more suspense and was surprised when so much of the story\u2019s backbone was revealed relatively early on. Nevertheless, I did want to find out exactly how things turned out in the end for each character. Despite not being the most compelling novel I\u2019ve ever read, \u201cShadows of Hope\u201d does offer a look at redemption and at facing life\u2019s challenges and heartbreaks.

Reviewed By: Arlena DeanRating: FourReview:\"Shadows of Hope\" by Georgiana DanielsMy Thoughts....What a very thought provoking read that will leave you with food for thought long after the read.There are a lots of good question in the ending of this novel that were right on point. Be ready for a read that deals with 'marriage, betrayal, infertility, drama, friendships, secrets, faith, pregnancy forgiveness and moving on.' I found these three characters Marissa, Tristan , Colin and Kaitlyn were all well developed, portrayed and believable giving the reader a decent story in the end. I did enjoy how this author was able to give Christian guidance in their daily life for some of the characters.This is definitely one of those stories [infidelity] where the choices one makes and the consequences that are left in how this all affects everyone involved when it's said and done. I also believe that there are many women who can relate to what has happened in Marissa's position. Bye the end did we have a 'love triangle?' \"How will God work this all out in all these peoples lives? Will Marissa and Colin\u2019s marriage survive this infidelity?\" 'Will God's love heal this relationships?' 'And what about forgiveness? Can they forgive themselves?' 'Will God forgive them?' Well, to find out the answers to all of these questions you will have to pick up this interesting read \"Shadows of Hope\" to see if there is any hope left for these people."}, {"userName": "Suzie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7431258-suzie", "userReview": "Rarely have I read a book that I\u2019ve waffled back and forth so much. From wanting Marissa and Colin to work things out to believing she has just cause to end it, the only thing I stood firm on was how much Colin\u2019s actions had hurt these two women.This book is not an easy one to read. There is not a pat, easy answer to unravel the tangle that Marissa and Colin\u2019s marriage has become. And as a Bible-believing, Christian, that says a lot.Throughout this story, I wanted Marissa to find her strength and gain her footing. I was impressed with Kaitlyn\u2019s maturity, and I was disgusted by Colin\u2019s behavior (even though the author tried to throw a little sympathy Colin\u2019s way, it wasn\u2019t near enough to make him a likable character in this story).Readers are pretty much going to wait until the last fifty pages for what you\u2019ve been waiting for the entire book to happen and then everything is tied up quickly but in a bit of a dissatisfying way. Mostly because I wanted to find out whether these three survive or thrive in the futures they\u2019ve chosen (no spoilers here).Georgiana Daniels definitely made a bold move in this story. Readers often revert to fiction to escape the hurts and disappointments of life, but Shadows of Hope is full of those exact things. The bright spot in this book is the friendship that Marissa and Kaitlyn forge but simply reading the book description is enough to hint that even that might not last.Disclosure statement:I receive complimentary books from publishers, publicists, and/or authors, including NetGalley.

Look at Marissa, she's almost sorta got her life together. She's got a job she loves, a husband who is sometimes home, but she's lacking the one thing she wants. The glue that flaked away in her marriage, a child. Look at Kaitlyn, twenty-something college student who falls for her professor. Entangled in a brief affair she finds herself pregnant, after he calls everything off. Never knowing he was married, but she's still pregnant and now facing life as a single mother. These are stories that are part of our everyday world. Miscarriage, infertility, even unplanned pregnancy are all things that so many women in our society deal with every day. Let's toss the guy back into the mix. I know, I know he's a skeez but wait a minute. Colin is almost a typical guy. His marriage isn't what it once it was, he and Marissa have lost their common ground and even their focus. He finds himself attracted to a young woman and doesn't think before he acts. He tries to fix it but it's already too late, Kaitlyn is already pregnant. It's easy to want to bash him for all of this. It's easy to find yourself more closely aligned with one woman or the other and go on a full scale bashing spree. Don't. The truth is they all played a part in getting there, each of them have something about them that we can identify with, and they each have to find a path to the next step.I'm gonna be honest, while the story was engaging and drew you into the mix of these characters it tended to drag in places. I liked how the story flow switched between the three main characters but sometimes I felt like they weren't connecting with the story and with me. I didn't get a good feel for Colin as a person. I mean I got him as the cheating husband, I got him as the ex, and even to some small margin as the professor but I didn't understand his motivation in any of the bigger picture. I'm not sure if it's because he wasn't solid in his identity so I didn't grasp it but. . . Colin just came across as a self-absorbed jerk that had a fringe of emotions and feelings that he never really explored. Marissa was so deep into her own head that she took all the emotion that no one else had and owned it in spades. I mean, I get that she had a lot to work through from her life but she was an emotion drain that started to come across as a touch whiny. A lot of the same situations came up over and over with no real resolution, much less forward momentum on them that it just dragged. Perhaps about fifty less pages would have been a bit more concise?I know I sound hateful right now but I really did enjoy this book. I would have liked to have a better understanding of Colin and who he really is as a person, and even to some degree Kaitlyn as there's so much about her as a person I'm interested in knowing. Marissa, her I'd love to see her in some intense therapy to deal with her life as a whole though not with Tristan. Tristan and Colin is another avenue that I need to see explored because that right there played such a role in this whole shebang that was never truly addressed. I would love to see an addition to this story. Where they all actually end up. I've not read this author before but I enjoy her writing style, I enjoy that she takes on the hard topics from a Christian perspective, and I look forward to reading more by her.I was provided a complimentary copy of this book by Barbour Publishing, NetGalley.

Written with a healthy dose of realism\u2014which I absolutely love\u2014SHADOWS OF HOPE does not sugarcoat or whitewash the effects the loss of communication and the sin of self-centeredness can have on a marriage, nor does it take a messy situation and tie it up in a nice neat bow.Marissa suspects her husband is having an affair. Knowing she isn\u2019t without fault for the distance in her marriage, she sets out to make things right. Colin is having an affair because he can\u2019t take the pressure at home. With Marissa laser-focused on conceiving, their marriage has spiraled to the point of perfunctory sex in order to get pregnant. Kaitlyn knows her relationship with her professor is against school rules, but what she feels for Colin is worth the risk, until she gets pregnant.What transpires is a cruel twist of fate. Marissa befriends Kaitlyn when she shows up at the pregnancy center Marissa manages. Feeling lost and alone, Kaitlyn\u2019s relationship with Marissa becomes a lifeline. When Colin finds out Kaitlyn is pregnant, he\u2019s devastated, knowing it will destroy Marissa and jeopardize his chance at tenure, but his desire to be a father also makes it that he wants to be involved with Kaitlyn\u2019s pregnancy. When Colin finally tells Marissa about his affair, and that he and his mistress have conceived a child, Marissa is shattered. Finding out it is Kaitlyn, is beyond anything she ever expected.SHADOWS OF HOPE is absolutely compelling. As the reader, you know everything that is going on behind the scenes, and the angst you feel builds, knowing Marissa and Kaitlyn are going to be devastated when they find out what they share besides friendship is the same man. I give the author credit for pointing out shortcomings in each of the characters, not just placing the blame on Colin, and even going as far as to portray Colin as a man with a compassionate heart, even if it is skewed. SHADOWS OF HOPE shows how easily people can fall away from their faith when they take even a single compromising step, and how we justify sin when we want what we know is wrong. Marissa put her desire for a child before her husband. Colin put his needs of fulfillment before the needs of his wife. And Kaitlyn justified a sexual relationship because she thought it was based on love. SHADOWS OF HOPE explores infidelity, deception, jealousy, adultery, selfishness, the need for communication in marriage, pressure from outside sources and how it can damage a marriage, etc., etc. The ending might be unsatisfying to some, but it is realistic. A heavy subject, but definitely a story that needs to be told, prompting readers to evaluate what compromises they might be making in their own lives.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Barbour Publishing and was under no obligation to post a review."}, {"userName": "Char (1RadReader59)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7057054-char-1radreader59", "userReview": "This was such an interesting story on so many levels. You have a man who has cheated on his wife and wants to play it off as just a phase he was going through. Mainly, because he felt so put upon by her demands to have sex to conceive a baby. Wow, I think I could make a list right now of guys calling him a candy-ass. Really?! His wife had a miscarriage of their child he won\u2019t talk about adoption. Yes, it was true his wife was forcing him to have sex. Do you all hear the choir of real men singing out, \u201cDude, Buck it UP!\u201d She basically, forced him to cheat is the way he looks at it. But when the guilt finally hits him he is pissed at her that he should call it off. Come on really!? Not because he is deathly afraid that he is her professor at the college she attends, that he is up for tenure, or that oh I don\u2019t know, \u2018Could lose my job' factor. No, that he is forced, because of his vows and his guilt of his wife may one more time have a meltdown like when they had the miscarriage. His resentment and contempt are so high you could almost feel it coming right off the pages. Not once does he speak of love? When the woman he has the affair with needs to talk he ignores her. She is a woman, Kaitlyn Morey, is twenty-six-years-old. She is what is called a retread. She continues through different methods to contact him but he ignores her. Kaitlyn works at the Bean. A coffee house which happens to be the one where Marissa, Colin\u2019s wife and her best friend and business partner, Tristan Hart, have been meeting for their morning meeting and coffee since the office coffee pot broke. Since the New Heights, a pregnancy resource center, ran mostly on grants and donations it would be awhile before they got a new one since other things were needed first. Since Kaitlyn never knew that Colin was married Marissa never knew about the affair. They have become friends after almost a year of coffee meetings at Kaitlyn\u2019s work. Now Kaitlyn was in need of the services the New Heights provided. See what a tangled web Colin cheats for every one of his selfish needs to have his cake and eat it too.

I was aware of the subject material before going in and I admit my curiosity was peaked and I wondered how this new to me author would tell this tale. This is a story that we get told by three different people: Marissa, her husband Colin, and Kaitlyn his girlfriend. The synopsis of this story pretty much tells you what to expect. What I was not prepared for was the strong feelings and emotions that went with reading this story.I will admit that parts of the story I had to skim, just so I would not be crying or getting angry over it. The author did a tremendous job of pulling the reader in and showing all sides of the situation. There was really no good outcome. I felt for Marissa as a wife and as a woman who was unable to have a child, especially when she found out that her husband\u2019s affair produced a child with another woman. I felt for Kaitlyn and her trusting yet na\u00efve nature that finds her in the predicament of being pregnant with her boyfriend\u2019s child only to find out he is married. And then we get Colin\u2019s viewpoint. He, in my opinion was confused and desperately wanted to fix things if albeit selfishly. What a tangled mess. I was not necessarily happy with the ending. I understand where the author was taking the story, however I still would have liked more closure. I am curious if there will be a follow-up.

The story is told from 3 different points of view, so the \"headspace\" is constantly shifting. It got confusing for me after a while, and limited my ability to connect with Marissa and Kaitlyn as much as I should have been able to.

They lived two separate lives in the same house, he had his job and she had hers and very little interaction between the two other than deception. I know that Marissa seemed to be blindsighted by her husbands unfaithfulness but she shouldn\u2019t have been.

After reading a couple of reviews, I'm confident that this book would have an even higher average rating if readers weren't expecting a happily ever after.A word of caution: I see it mentioned in a couple of reviews, and I agree:If unfaithfulness, panic attacks, separation/divorce are possible emotional triggers for you, this is NOT your book.

I thoroughly enjoyed the writing abilities of this author. I liked how she had the POV's by all three of the characters, Marissa (wife), Colin (cheater), & Kaitlyn (mistress).Fictional infidelity stories are difficult for me to read, but I think Daniels did a great job at writing it. These are realistic characters even though many times they don't have redeeming qualities readers would be drawn to initially. The ending...depends who you are as to if you'll like it. It makes you think. Some readers may wish for more closure, but sometimes this kind of ending leaves you with...as the title says, Shadows of Hope.I received this paperback from the publisher.

It was on most levels. The story is told from three different viewpoints: the wife, the cheating husband and the other woman. Oddly enough, the only believable character is the other woman, who is the most mature of the three. The wife is quite self absorbed and thinks only if her own issues, has allowed her disappointment with infertility to basically destroy her marriage. Don't get me wrong, there is never a reason to cheat on a marriage, but each party must work to have a healthy one. The husband just did not seem real to me at all, seemingly not caring what happened. He didn't want the other woman, but wanted to intrude on her life anytime he wanted to see their baby. The ending was not all it could have been, either, rather sudden. Too bad, for the writing was good.*I received a complimentary copy of this book from Barbour Publishing and was under no obligation to post a review."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9945907-amy", "userReview": "Just an okay read for me."}, {"userName": "Martha", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6966032-martha", "userReview": "I found this book to be a refreshing change from some tales similar to this. It addressed the topic head on without skirting the huge issues. Adultery and infertility were two key topics in this book. I loved the mention of doulas, grants for those in need of their services and found that especially wonderful as a doula myself. The writing style is excellent and touched on many key phrases that would be said to a Christian woman in a marriage that is falling apart. My only complaint would be that it left me many questions in the end, which again, is real life.

Shadows of hope tells a vivid story of not only their journey to overcome the strain infertility has placed on their marriage, but their individual sources of distraction from the issue. While Marissa is distracting herself with the clinic she has built, her husband has a distraction all his own. Attempting to fast track his career as a college professor into tenured status, Collin has placed everything on the line for a young co-ed; including his marriage. Tristan, best friend to Marissa is caught between a rock and a hard place. He has to watch his friend agonize her way through the situation, without wanting anyone to help. Conflicting with his psychologist nature to help. Tristan may not be on team Collin, but he does a good job of providing unbiased advice. Meanwhile, Marissa is befriending the very women that has her contemplating what to do about her marriage; Collin\u2019s mistress. Saving grace for the mistress, Kaitlyn, she has no idea until it\u2019s too late, that Collin is married. You won\u2019t spend the whole story disliking her or upset (or that could just be me). I think anyone can identify with Kaitlyn\u2019s guilt at being a part of situation she didn\u2019t know the whole truth about until it was too late. Ignoring the red flags, an often in hindsight, obvious signs that something wasn\u2019t right.While there are some spiritual elements & brief scripture references in the story, it wouldn\u2019t be hard for someone who has had the same struggles, and doesn\u2019t believe, to identify with the struggles of Marissa & Collin. Georgiana Daniels uses great imagery & technique to evoke emotional responses to her characters. You will hurt with Marissa as you watch her attempting to cope with the infertility. Which will leave you furious with Collin\u2019s behavior at focusing on his own selfish feelings, from the problems he has created. I gave the book 3 stars, because I didn\u2019t like the development of Marissa. She lacks accountability in her actions and throughout the story. Collin\u2019s affair isn\u2019t justifiable, but her unwillingness to accept responsibility for the state of her marriage prior to knowing is on Marissa. As well as her relationship with Tristan. When you knowingly manipulate a person\u2019s involvement in your life because it is beneficial for you, its wrong. In Marissa\u2019s relationship with Tristan, you get no sense that Marissa has any regard for how her desire for his friendship affects Tristan. She acknowledges awareness, but never accountability. Overall, I would say it is a good story, with a lovable group of characters. The ending definitely came out of left field for me. It was definitely a plot twist I wasn\u2019t expecting."}, {"userName": "Becca-Rae", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60763817-becca-rae", "userReview": "Have you ever read a book that made you upset because you could see the big picture while the characters remained in the dark? This was me in a nutshell while reading this book. I wanted to shout at the characters to get them to say the right things so that they could all be on the same page. Emotionally speaking this book was a very difficult read. If you're looking for something cheerful and lighthearted, it's not the book for you. It deals with very real issues in a non-sugarcoated way. I think when it comes to reading Christian Fiction we are often spoiled by the way things always seem to work out in the end and we read those types of books expecting that. As a result I think it can cause us to expect those types of outcomes in the real world as well, and life doesn't always go as we plan.Kaitlyn made a mistake by entering into a relationship with one of her professors at the college, but she had no clue that he was also married. Marissa questions her husband's fidelity but she is too afraid to ask him despite finding clues that would lead her to the truth. Colin is remorseful that he was unfaithful to his wife, but in trying to fix things with his wife, he can't help the tug he feels for wanting to raise the baby with Kaitlyn. Despite trying counseling, Marissa and Colin's marriage is in real danger.Currently speaking I am still emotionally processing what I've just read. No, this isn't one of your \"feel-good\" reads, but it's definitely \"real.\" If you can't guess by the actions of the characters, Colin is not a Christian, but Marissa is. Not being equally yoked to your spouse can have devastating effects on your marriage. (I'm not sure where Kaitlyn stands other than expressing her desire for God). The characters battle with very real emotions over the devastating effects of sin. The story is told from the perspective of all three characters so the reader is able to see how each of them is processing the drama of their situations.In my mind I want to give this 4 stars because even though it was very well written, I wasn't emotionally prepared for the ending. On the flip side, the author is facing the difficult battle of publishing a book that doesn't quite fit the mold for what's expected within the genre. Despite finishing the book over an hour ago now, I am still in an emotional fog. It was a good book not just because of how it was written, but because of how deeply it sucked me in. No one ever said this life would be easy, and I believe the author did a powerful job of expressing just that. Therefore, I don't think I can give it any less than the full 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3690313-jill", "userReview": "\"What if......you struggled with infertility but unknowingly befriended your husband's pregnant mistress?...the woman you were seeing behind your wife's back gets pregnant, threatening your job and your marriage?...your boyfriend never told you he was married and you discover you're pregnant?\"Marissa, Colin and Kaitlyn must deal with these questions in Georgianna Daniels' \"Shadows of Hope\".\u00a0 Told from each of their viewpoints, we see how one situation affects three different people.On a positive note, the story was well-written and had well-developed characters.\u00a0 However, Daniels does little to create likable characters.\u00a0 Marissa is so self-absorbed that she doesn't see clearly her role in the demise of her marriage or the inappropriate relationship she has with her long-time friend and co-worker, Tristan.\u00a0 Collin, who should receive credit for recognizing the error of his ways and trying to salvage his marriage, inadvertently becomes the victim of Marissa's dismal attitude even though she claims to want to save her marriage regardless of the affair.\u00a0 \u00a0Kaitlyn, though young, shows more maturity and insight than any of them.Then, there is Tristan, who does not get a chance to show his side, though he is the real victim of the story.\u00a0 It is clear that he has been in love with Marissa since college.\u00a0 With no chance of his affections being returned, he chooses to work with Marissa, listen to her self-absorbed rants, enable her behavior even though he is a psychiatrist, and give up a life of his own.\u00a0 All the while Marissa is totally oblivious.

Her coworker, Tristan tells her that the truth usually isn't as bad as the not knowing. Was he ever wrong about that one.Colin is a professor at a college and had became involved with one of his students. The guilt drove him to break things off. Little did he know that Kaitlyn had earth shattering news for him. After repeated attempts to tell Colin her news, she was finally able to tell him they were expecting a baby. Colin seemed most afraid that the university was going to find out as he was up for tenure.While both Marissa and Kaitlyn are professing Christians, it seemed shallow. They both prayed and Marissa sometimes attended church with her mother. Colin wanted no part of Christianity.Marissa had met Kaitlyn at The Bean, the coffee shop she frequented. Upon learning of Kaitlyn's pregnancy, she encouraged her to come to the pregnancy center for help. This led to the two becoming friends and Kaitlyn even working part time there. All the while, neither had any idea that Marissa was married to the man who was the father to Kaitlyn's unborn child. Marissa had not taken Colin's last name when they married, which seemed strange to me, but it's one of the reason no dots were connected.Kaitlyn had no idea Colin was married, but once he confessed that to her (after being told of her pregnancy), she realized she did not want to be with a man who could do that to his wife.Colin seemed weak to me. He first wanted his marriage to work out, but when he thought Marissa would never forgive him, he then told Marissa they could be together and raise their child.

Stories about infidelity are really hard to make me like. I figured that since this was a Christian novel, it might be something I'd be more apt to like. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.First of all, I didn't like most of the characters. Colin had NO redeeming qualities to me, and I felt like he was trying to work on his marriage with Marissa because that's what he was \"supposed\" to do instead of actually wanting to, and I really hated being in his head (at least it wasn't first person) for his scenes because of how much I didn't like him or his attitude.Marissa was also pretty self-centered, though when she discovered her husbands infidelity I was much more sympathetic to her. Her character felt very wishy-washy, as she was portrayed as either too aloof to her husband's needs, or too clingy to her husband. Which one was it? Was she obsessed with him to the point where she couldn't have meaning without him and a child, or was she draining him dry putting all of her attention at her job? I couldn't make heads or tails of it and I found it hard to really understand her character.Kaitlyn was fairly likable once she got over her naivete about her relationship with Colin. Mostly that's because you feel sorry for her being in a crappy situation, and she is pretty strong in her boundaries.Tristan was just there so Marissa could have more tension between her husband. His role in her emotional well-being would have just as easily been filled by a woman, but it was clear he was only there so Colin would have a source of jealousy.As for the plot, I felt like the point that everyone was ignorant of their true connections went on way too long. It read as pretty false, considering the supposedly close relationship Marissa and Kaitlyn had. It was hard to feel connected to any of their characters or that they had lives outside of their scenes, and I didn't really enjoy much of the book. I will say it did keep me reading (I took it on a camping trip/relay race) though I really don't like books that mix first and third person. Marissa's character development was there, at least, though I didn't feel like the other characters went through as much development as she did.All in all it was a disappointment, I'm sorry to say. Someone else may like it more.
