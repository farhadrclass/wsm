Very Irish in the post-Joycean tradition, it nevertheless was the beginning of a new form of literary expression as some discerning critics recognized at the time, drawing heavily on the author's time spent in London as a young man, and especially on his experiences as a male nurse. It has for many years been one of the most popular novels of one of the most seminal figures of the twentieth century. There's a sort of comfort in the dry, bare, language, in the spooky imagery and the incantatory repetitions... -- Howard Kinlay. My Review: This is always hard when describing Beckett. Murphy loves Celia, the prostitute. Miss Counihan, surprisingly anthropoid for an Irishwoman, loves Murphy. Neary, a philosopher, comes to love Murphy as his best friend. Then there's this guy Murphy plays chess with in the mental hospital where Murphy goes to work.Okay, it can't really be this hard. Murphy, an Irish depressive, has to get a job because Celia, his petite amie, thinks it will do him good. So he leaves Ireland, goes to London and starts working at a mental hospital. All sorts of Irish problems follow him, but Murphy finds himself escaping them among the mad, who have abdicated their responsibilities to the staff and lead lives of unencumbered irresponsibility that Murphy envies. Mr. Endon, the wisest madman, lures Murphy into playing a game of chess with him, and it's that game that forms the spine of the book. It's described in loving, and to me incomprehensible, detail, but if you're patient and willing to educate yourself with a chess reference source as you read, you'll come to realize that this game is the novel you're reading, and the novel is the chess game.How do chess games end? Think on that for a moment. The novel's ending will then be clear to you. It's not the easiest read on the shelf. It's well worth your time and effort to engage with, because it's gorgeously wrought...there's a line about owls in the zoo, their joys and sufferings not starting until dark, that I wish I could find so as to quote exactly, but it's...well...perfect, and at the moment it comes in the narrative, so startlingly apt that it makes my hair stand up to remember it.Beckett hated Ireland for its conformist, dead-spirited religiosity. He abhorred any and all forms of hypocrisy, and this (I think, could be wrong about this) is the last novel he wrote in English because he regarded the language as the carrier (think Typhoid Mary) of hypocrisy. (So what did he do? He wrote in FRENCH! Oh the irony.) Murphy is the soul-scream of an angry lover. It caustically throws in your face every unkind or unworthy thought you've ever had, every casually cruel deed you've ever done, and makes you weep and smile and sigh with pleasure as it alternately berates and caresses you.Yes, this book is a bad love affair with a beautiful man put between hard covers. It's brilliant, it's beautiful, and it's never to be forgotten, even when you wish you could.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License."}, {"userName": "K.D. Absolutely", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely", "userReview": "My very first Beckett. Yesterday morning, when I finally closed this book, I was speechless. This is a work of a genius.Reading the first half was a bit of a challenge though. If you are not used to reading modernist or postmodernist works, there is a big chance that Beckett's writing style would discourage you. Samuel Beckett (1906-1989) apprenticed with his friend and idol - my other favorite Irish writer - the author of Ulysses (5 stars too!), James Joyce (1882-1941). So, their styles have similarities but still distinctly recognizable. I liked them both. Although, \"Murphy\" of course is a lot shorter and easier to understand than \"Ulysses.\"But I have to admit again that I am not sure I understood everything that Beckett wanted to convey in this book. Like the attitude that I used for me to finish \"Ulysses,\" I just went on and on with my reading even if I had to reread some paragraphs twice or thrice. This explains why it took me 1 month to finish this book. There were so many parts where I asked myself: \"Huh? Again? What did he say?\" However, in the second half, when Murphy was already working as a nurse in the hospital for crazy people, that's when the story made a huge turn and everything started to fall into right places. The conversation of his friends at the sickbed of Murphy's girlfriend Celia was the first scene that left me in awe because the prose, the playful beautiful prose, was something that I have not encountered yet even in his friend James Joyce's works. Then that scene was closely followed by the well-known chess game that seems to have encapsulated or mimicked or mirrored the whole novel. I am not good in playing chess and I don't exactly know how to read the written moves and I saw this style in Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (3 stars) by Lewis Carroll but the listed explanations (letters a to r) at the bottom of the game sequence adequently explained to a non-chess playing person like me how the game relates to the characters in the novel. Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant.Beckett's play of words is something that enthralled me. Even the effective use of font like: Music, Music, Music with the font going from 10pts to 14pts seems like meaningful or his repeated use of a phrase like \"A rest\" then a paragraph, the another \"A rest\", then another paragraph, and then another \"A rest.\" Then you as a reader will ask yourself silent in your mind: Why? What's happening?\" then you will later realize. You can't help but be mesmerized by his skillful execution in writing. I have not seen anything as effective as Beckett's style.My advice to those who want to read this: don't be too bothered about the specifics in the first half. Just continue reading because the meat is in the second half where everything will become crystal clear. Guaranteed. To. Take. Your. Breath. Away!"}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2927182-ellen", "userReview": "Thought I'd review this as so few have, and this is Beckett's first, best, and funniest novel.Many people think of Beckett's characters, and they come up with something like this:These post-apocalyptic, hollowed-out characters sitting around in the blank landscapes of Beckett's plays have been blasted to hell and back; they patiently accept whatever happens to them and seem to be waiting for some form of grace.In contrast, Murphy (the title character of the novel) isn't going anywhere, but he couldn't be happier. Unlike so many of the characters in Beckett's plays, Murphy is bursting with life. He might be one hell of an odd duck, but he's alive and hopping. Murphy has no desire to be housebroken by society or to parcel out his days and nights as productively as a character like Robinson Crusoe. Murphy isn't alarmed by the void that sends Lucy Snowe (Villette) into a near frenzy, but rather seeks out these unstructured spaces actively. To achieve personal bliss, Murphy sits tied--by seven scarves--and naked \"in his rocking chair of undressed teak, guaranteed not to crack, warp, shrink, corrode, or creak at night.\" This rather bizarre arrangement works to give his body pleasure and \"free his mind\": \"For it was not until his body was appeased that he could come alive in his mind....And life in his mind gave him pleasure, such pleasure that pleasure was not the word.\"In short, Murphy isn't heading anywhere in a hurry; his lack of what we might view as motivation parodies time, a point one could gather from the book's opening line, which neatly lampoons all the novels with predictably dull first lines about weather and time, and also lets us know we aren't in Kansas anymore: The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new.I've been thinking a lot about humor this summer because I'm pondering whether to teach a course on the topic. While I think Murphy is one of the funniest books in literature, it's hard to define why. Like explaining a joke, which falls apart upon examination, nothing destroys humor faster than theorizing its characteristics. And it's pretty telling that those who have tried to define humor--Aristotle, Sigmund Freud, Henri Bergson, and Immanuel Kant, to name a few--are some pretty humorless dudes. Perhaps funny people know better than to try to define funny-dom. Prodded by Celia, his good-hearted but mercenary prostitute girlfriend, Murphy reluctantly sets out to find employment: \"Murphy on the jobpath was a striking figure...\" Beckett goes on at length about the qualities of the green suit Murphy sports: \"His suit was not green but aeruginous....No less than the colour the cut was striking. The jacket, a tube in its own right, descended clear of the body as far as mid-thigh, where the skirts were slightly reflexed like the mouth of a bell in mute appeal to be lifted that some found hard to resist....With regard to the material of the suit, the bold claim was advanced by the makers that it was holeproof. This was true in the sense that it was entirely non-porous. It admitted no air from the outer world, it allowed none of Murphy's own vapours to escape.Murphy's unusual aspect is noted by some of his potential employers. He's turned down for the job of \"smart boy\" at Gray's Inn Road, where he's assessed harshly:\"'E ain't smart....\"Nor 'e ain't a boy\" [and:]\"'E don't look rightly human to me.\" But luck shines on Murphy and he gets a job as a male nurse at Magdalen Mental Mercyseat, \"a hospital for the better-class mentally deranged.\" Unaware that Murphy is happily employed by M.M.M., most of the book's characters are busily searching for him.Despite the rather elaborate plot--which mocks plots in general--the book is not about the story arc. Whatever absurd situations confront Murphy are ultimately beside the point. The book's focus is on Murphy and his desire to avoid the sound and fury, all the tomorrows and tomorrows and tomorrows that natter at us and make us conform to a world that fits about as well as Murphy's green suit. As Murphy explains, \"I am not of the big world, I am of the little world.\"* * *And, as a added boon, some of Beckett's better phrases:\"mercantile gehenna\" - the work world\"long hank of Apollonian asthenia,\" \"schizoidal spasmophile,\" \"seedy solipsist\" - words to call your friends\"jacking their jaws apart with the gag, spurning their tongues aside with the spatula, till the last tundish of drench is absorbed\" - Ticklepenny describing how he feeds the patients at Magdalene Mental Mercyseat"}, {"userName": "Makis Dionis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13556007-makis-dionis", "userReview": "\u0395\u03ba\u03b4\u03cc\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u0394\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, 1970. \u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf \u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 1969 \u03b7 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7 \u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b2\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03c0\u03ad\u03ba\u03b5\u03c4 (1938) \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c1\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac. \u039c\u03b5 \u03ad\u03ba\u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 Joyce, \u03bf \u039c\u03c0\u03ad\u03ba\u03b5\u03c4 \u03be\u03b5\u03b4\u03b9\u03c0\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c6\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bc\u03b9\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf \u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u0395\u03c0\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf, \u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03c4 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u03ba \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 , Murphy, \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd. \u0393\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b3\u03cd\u03c1\u03c9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, \u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123397-andrew", "userReview": "I've read this one twice, and am gearing up for another it's such a warm hug.

(He was one of those people who never lends anything, and in any case I wouldn't have been able to read and return it in good time, as this time that year I was embarking on months of convalescence following a very severe bout of flu.) It was never my intention to leave it quite this long, but - as per an old comment - whenever I picked it up, I found the first couple of pages too depressing. Honestly, what was I reading? Must've made some skewed assumptions, for different stuff was happening on the paper this time. And Beckett is not the writer I thought he was, a minimalist miserablist - my only previous experience being a not-very-careful teenage reading of Waiting For Godot whilst standing in a library, it being too short to waste a loan on. I was reminded of none so much as Pynchon: the black humour, the ridiculousness, the near-farcical caper, the breadth of vocabulary... this required even more frequent looking-up than Pynchon as Beckett's very fond of obscure uses of fairly common words, as well as his rare archaisms and classicisms (Joycean to those who've read him more recently, no doubt). A spideysense of more to a sentence often proved right: consulting the barely adequate ereader dictionary, and looking through definitions, would reveal an unusual or more precise meaning, or perhaps that an etymological root had been engaged in furtive wordplay with something else nearby. Impressed, I was alright. (Why can we still not get the Shorter Oxford, never mind the full thing, as an optional booster for these gadgets? c.35% of the terms I tried to look up whilst reading Murphy were not in the Concise as found on Kindle.) Why (2) isn't Murphy found on some of those lists of Great London Novels? Not that I've done a comprehensive survey as research for this post, mind. Murphy's questionable progression from the 1930s boardinghouses of SW10 and then - with paramour Celia - N7, and on to work in one of those outer-North-London psychiatric monstrosities as later chronicled by Iain Sinclair and Will Self ... not to mention the wanderings of so many named streets and tubes and markets, and the Mary Poppins-in-negative interludes of kite flying in Hyde Park - this is what The London Novel is made of, surely. There are chapters set in Ireland too, which in the eyes of some may disqualify it, but Murphy's atmosphere of grubby, fray-cuffed, straitened, eccentric London bedsitland is exquisitely done if you have affection for that setting. Description of the way light comes through the windows of a dingy flat over a day's course may not be adjectivally conventional description, yet - or so - it pins it utterly.I long had a bad habit, a faulty reflex, almost, of looking for a person in their favourite books and films (more so when it was someone I fancied, a elusive sprite, than a long-standing close friend who could simply be asked). This wouldn't always work, I realised as I got older. Not everyone's favourite things are favourites because of a deep identification. And even where someone does identify, it won't be with every aspect of a work or character - so a person who doesn't know them well could misunderstand and missassume all over the shop. Perhaps you actually won't see how them something is until you've known them a good while. (Seven years it was, mostly the long-distance friendship of the afterwards, and it was me who stopped it - there was a veiled reference in my post about The Ice Palace.) And I can't remember when this strange wish of finding someone in a book was so fully rewarded; a remarkable correlation of traits between unusual people, one real, one made up by a very clever Irish bloke in the 1930s. It would be indecent to write it all up in public, but I consider it incumbent on me to spare the (theoretical??) embarrassment of someone unknown to you by clarifying that the similarities to Murphy don't include penchants for self-bondage or astrology. Curiously or not, there are a handful of other things that feel more *me* than *him*; some always were, some changed - and as for those shared, I now understand Murphy's love of introspection more than I would have nearly a decade ago. The character of Murphy is, of course, ultimately mocked here (his Cartesian dualism is as much nonsense as that theory always is) and the book's peculiar personal history may give me more affection for it and all its characters than might otherwise make sense. (Given its absurdist intellectualism, I can understand those who don't find it very human.)This is very close to 5 stars - just some scenes of grimness mean I hold back on that last little bit - as the confluence of extreme cleverness and silliness and darkness and resonance is very much a winner. And if I didn't have an even more absurd number of other books already, I'd be wanting some more Beckett, please, with a tentative view to joining Fans of."}, {"userName": "Cymru Roberts", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8997708-cymru-roberts", "userReview": "As a first effort, Beckett demonstrates that he has total control over the conventions of a novel. The tricky ways in which he unravels exposition, the exquisite wordplay (keep dictionary on hand), and not least the characters themselves all attest to his strength as a writer. He also has sensory-perception and an ear for tone, a \"viridescent\" tone in fact, which is lovely. Combined with deep imaginative understanding, this book is heavier than it reads. It reads like a breeze. And funny to boot!First published in 1938, Murph predates Pynchon and Vonnegut (Why aren't these authors compared more often? Just cuz Pynch is \"smart\" I guess). As a verbal freestyler, it's hard to argue any of the later literary tricksters are as keen or poetic as Beckett. The drawback to the arch-sarcastic literary mode is that it can be hard to take anything seriously, like, when someone dies for instance. Becky is tender enough in parts here however to eschew a total lack of caring for plot, and Murph's eventual post-demise is one of my favourite scenes ever. If we all could be utilized so!If this is Beck's first book, I can imagine why he won the Nobel Prize. I plan on going in chronological order with him.

One might call it a parody of manners, or a scatter-brained farce of love and desire. It's all that and much more. My first foray into Beckett, and I must admit that I wasn't deterred by his obtuse, madcap and heartbreaking observations about the struggles of day-to-day life. His prose reads like a lonely man's guide to madness where epiphanies pass like gas, and boredom develops its owns manic design. While he writes at angles (and around corners), there is lots of heart behind the lively prose. Most of the characters are wildly off-center, but in the end, you really feel for them. As the main player, Murphy is a clusterfuck of idleness, contradiction, and callousness -- he mistreats women, believes in all things insubstantial - but his transformation from layabout to caretaker (in an asylum, no less) is captivating. The supporting cast is just as entertaining - Cooper, the drunk - Miss Couninan, the embodiment of the lustful Irish - Celia, the sound and caring lover of Murhpy - Ticklepenny, the failed, miserable poet - Miss Corridge, the miserly landlady with a peculiar body odor ('when body odor and volubility meet, then there is no remedy'). These characters give life to a book that at its core is about failure - no matter how hard one tries, the end is absurd, the climax not ascending but leveling off in a flatline tremor. The ending of the book typifies this, consisting of a soaring cruel joke where slapstick turns heartbreaking in one sentence. Beckett throws so much in 170 pages that it's impossible to even provide a synopsis. A high watermark of literature - playful and tragic, profane and manic.Selections from MURPHY:'He had the curious hunted walk, like that of a destitute diabetic in a strange city.''He thought of the four caged owls in Battersea Park whose joys and sorrows did not begin till dusk.''Here he was not free, but a mote in the dark of absolute freedom.''Enter Cooper. Like a mollusc torn from its rock Wylie came away.''At the corner he paused to admire the pub, superior to any he had ever seen. Suddenly a man was standing in the porch, radiant in his shirt-sleeves and an apron of fine baize, holding fast a bottle of whiskey. His face was as the face of an angel, he stretched out his hand upon Cooper.''...in the morning nothing remained of the dream but a postmonition of calamity, nothing of the candle but a little coil of tallow.''...his success with the patients was the signpost pointing to them. It meant that they felt in him what they had been and he in them what he would be.''...simplicity is as slow as a hearse and as long as a last breakfast.'"}, {"userName": "Lee Foust", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13984676-lee-foust", "userReview": "Murphy pretty perfectly explicates the literary strategy of the absurd. It's a very, very funny novel--yet also, in the end, based upon the events recounted, it can only be classified as a tragedy. Once it occurred to me that such a contradiction in the classical orders--recounting deaths in a somber or melancholy key and the complications of romance leading to marriage as a series of humorous blunders--is about as good a definition of the literature of the absurd as we are going to get. As fanciful and literary as the strategy is, it's the depicting of the ridiculousness of human suffering and our demise, which goes against the grain of literary tradition, that smells lightly of truth. For we know that tragedy can be funny, that slipping on a banana peel is actually quite painful after all, and that sometimes love is a far worse fate than certain more merciful forms of death. Therefore the literary recombination of mood and subject matter reeks of disorder even as it is only a re-combination of already established orders--a tragic tale recounted in a humorous key.Notably, this is both Beckett's first bona fides masterpiece and his first entirely concurrently published novel. I'm currently re-assessing these, my long-time favorite author's works, by reading them in the order that he wrote them and, doing so, it's quite evident how rapidly he improved his writing from Dream of Fair to Middling Women through the story collection and pastiche of More Pricks than Kicks to this very smooth, entertaining, and even, at times, moving read. Finally the narrator frames the tale winningly and lightly rather than bludgeoning us with his ironic and hammy presence, creating many of the novel's entertaining chuckles with his pithy observations and clever turns of phrase. The characters themselves are treated a bit more kindly than those of the above-mentioned first two books and they are allowed to emerge more honestly, it seemed to me, from out of caricature and into portraiture. There's still some artistic distance between characters, story, and the intrusive narrative voice, but I did manage to feel for these characters, despite the cruel absurdity of the indifference of the universe to their petty desires, tribulations, and their eventual ends. Bravo, Mr. Beckett. Now on to Watt.Also it bears mentioning that this novel features, arguably, the greatest first line of a novel ever.

Although there may have been plenty of games where players attack and defend both at the same time (which may be what \"affence\" suggests: attack and defence), I am not aware of any known word in the chess lingo which combines the concepts of attack and defense in a single word. \"Affence\" does not appear in the authoritative and encyclopedic \"The Oxford Companion to Chess,\" for example.

White's 38th move, for example, elicited this commentary:\"No words can express the torment of mind that goaded White to this abject offensive.\"This novel is, for me, principally a demented display of the author's writing prowess.

Or seeing a play in another language. Or coming across a street performer performing complicated and dizzying feats\u2014like juggling on a high-wire while simultaneously turning cartwheels and meditating.\tIn other words, Beckett, for me, felt like an entertaining yet befuddling spectacle. I love his playfulness with language, his daringness in using completely inaccessible vocabulary and classic/archaic allusions, and the Shakespearean absurdity and seamlessness of his dialogue. He is not a realist, yet his characters never fail to strike a chord of reality. I wasn\u2019t always sure what was going on, and his language lost me nearly every other page, but about halfway through I gave up trying to comprehend every sentence and just went along for the ride. His genius is undeniable, and I have no qualms with \u201cexistential pointlessness.\u201d However, I can\u2019t say I ever got fully taken in by his prose, nor did I experience the depth of feeling that other writers can elicit. He\u2019s in his own class; a comedy of consciousness and black irony, a satire whose \u201cpoint\u201d or \u201ccenter\u201d is elusive as a runaway kite. I found Beckett worth reading for linguistic inventiveness alone, but I suspect that the deeper forces at work in Murphy will surface with time. Come to think of it, he reminds me vaguely of Gertrude Stein\u2014an inverse \u201cfool\u201d who confounds with his complexity of words, rather than complicating through simplicity as Stein does. Both writers \u201cget under [my:] skin,\u201d as Stein once rightly declared of her own sentences. There\u2019s no one else quite like them, so perhaps by default they\u2019re like each other.

The book begins with the title character, who has tied himself naked to a rocking chair and rocks back and forth in the dark, faster and faster, eventually crashing. Escaping reality is what Murphy enjoys, and you wonder how anyone so self-absorbed can attract any friends who care for him. The \u201cfriends\u201d in this novel are really an eclectic collection of followers. One day they discover that Murphy has truly \u201cescaped,\u201d or is, at least, no longer around. Their search for him, each for separate reasons, drives the plot. Murphy, unknown to most his world, has finally stumbled (or bumbled) into gainful employment in, of all places, a mental hospital where he works as a nurse. What transpires next follows the strange motivations of his friends as they search (or wait) for Murphy to turn up. The final chapter reveals what happens to him, and the story\u2019s end is ludicrous. But if you piece Murphy\u2019s character together, bit by bit, as I did, the reader has at least a chance to find the ending totally believable. Take time to do this. It\u2019s not a bad way to read this book.I recommend this novel, but as to style, Beckett\u2019s economy of words was often too difficult for me to understand at first read, and I found myself wishing the story was less reflective and more moment to moment."}, {"userName": "Kevin Lawrence", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22931479-kevin-lawrence", "userReview": "Re-read this novel after decades and after reading most everything else by Beckett, I better appreciate how this novel anticipates many of the themes and stylistic elements that Beckett will later pursue.

Fin dalle prime righe ci viene svelato nella sua essenza, come se l\u2019autore avesse urgenza di presentarci la sua invenzione: un protagonista tanto diverso da quelli che animavano i romanzi dell\u2019epoca. Ed \u00e8 una presentazione quanto mai sorprendente, visto che lo troviamo nudo e legato alla sua sedia dondolo: \u201cStava seduto cos\u00ec perch\u00e9 gli faceva piacere star seduto cos\u00ec. Prima di tutto piacere del corpo, appagamento fisico. Poi piacere dello spirito, allargamento nel suo mondo spirituale. Soltanto dopo aver appagato il corpo, poteva cominciare a vivere nello spirito. E il suo modo di vivere nello spirito gli dava un enorme piacere, quasi un\u2019assenza di dolore.\u201d Gesti stereotipati, un dondolio via via pi\u00f9 lento, un movimento ipnotico che sembra il viatico al raggiungimento di uno stato di trance. Da subito il dualismo corpo/spirito, la necessit\u00e0 di placare i bisogni del primo per avere accesso al mondo del secondo, quello che Murphy riconosce come il suo vero mondo, quello dal quale gli altri cercano di strapparlo via e quello nel quale lui cerca costantemente rifugio perch\u00e9 non \u00e8 interessato a ci\u00f2 che accade fuori da s\u00e9: la realt\u00e0 \u00e8 irredimibile, e da questo punto di vista l\u2019incipit cos\u00ec noto del romanzo (il sole splendeva, senza possibilit\u00e0 di alternative, sul niente di nuovo) \u00e8 una vera e propria dichiarazione di intenti. Murphy aspira all\u2019atarassia e il primum movens su questo cammino \u00e8 il tentativo di annullare o ridurre il potere della volont\u00e0, intesa come molla che muove le nostre passioni. Quando prova a sprofondare nel suo spirito, lo fa per abbandonarsi al torpore, non per seguire pensieri o speculazioni. Quella che detta il tempo \u00e8 la musica del suo Io, non quella suonata dal pensiero cosciente. Il problema del protagonista del romanzo consiste nel non riuscire a conciliare i contrari nel suo cuore perch\u00e9 il suo spirito \u00e8 una grande sfera cava, ermeticamente chiusa all\u2019universo esterno. Succede cos\u00ec che esperienza mentale ed esperienza fisica parlino in Murphy linguaggi diversi, di qui la frattura, l\u2019impossibilit\u00e0 di armonizzare le due parti della sua persona che per questo risulta divisa. Per questo gli unici individui per i quali prova empatia sono i pazienti della clinica psichiatrica nella quale si trova a lavorare; loro non vogliono nulla da lui (a differenza da tutti gli altri con i quali entra in contatto e che per un motivo o per l\u2019altro pretendono di cambiarlo), loro sono indifferenti al mondo circostante, anche loro \u2013 come Murphy \u2013 hanno qualcosa di rotto dentro. Il dramma di Murphy deflagra nel momento in cui, invece di accettare la situazione di incomunicabilit\u00e0 alla quale si \u00e8 condannato, prova a stabilire un contatto con il signor Endon, un paziente schizofrenico. La partita a scacchi tra i due rappresenta il climax del romanzo e uno dei vertici della poetica beckettiana: Murphy prova a gettare un ponte tra lui e un individuo che giudica simile a s\u00e9 e per farlo utilizza le mosse del gioco come fossero lettere di un alfabeto diverso da quello consueto, un linguaggio nuovo per tentare una comunicazione altrimenti impossibile. \u00c8 una partita nella quale si gioca tutto: dapprima cerca di ripetere sulla scacchiera i movimenti del suo avversario per dimostrargli che \u00e8 come lui, poi prova a farlo uscire dal guscio, invitandolo a mangiare dei pezzi per accorciare le distanze e cos\u00ec attirarlo nel suo territorio. Tutto inutile, il signor Endon non gioca contro Murphy ma gioca da solo, e dopo aver abbozzato qualche movimento ripiega progressivamente verso le posizioni che occupava all\u2019inizio del gioco, indifferente al suo avversario: Murphy per lui non esiste, \u00e8 uguale a tutti gli altri. Di qui la sconfitta, non tanto nella partita a scacchi quanto nel progetto del protagonista, condannato a una solitudine senza speranza: Murphy non chiedeva di cambiare il suo destino di essere diviso, ma almeno di condividere con qualcuno la separazione tra corpo e spirito che vive dolorosamente sulla sua pelle. Murphy \u00e8 un gran libro, un libro denso, angosciante e ironico, una distesa enorme che si estende in ogni direzione, anche (soprattutto) in profondit\u00e0. Ovunque ci soffermiamo, se iniziamo a scavare troviamo materiale, spunti per nuove riflessioni. Murphy \u00e8 una specie di Moloch al cospetto del quale si pu\u00f2 ragionare solo per approssimazione; \u00e8 difficile procedere con equilibrio e misura, molto pi\u00f9 facile provare un senso di disorientamento, l\u2019impressione di trovarsi a navigare nel caos accontentandosi di seguire alcune linee di pensiero con la consapevolezza che ce ne sono molte di pi\u00f9 che finiranno per essere trascurate o, peggio, non comprese compiutamente."}, {"userName": "Branko Jovanovski", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10920656-branko-jovanovski", "userReview": "The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new. Murphy sat out of it, as though he were free, in a mew in West Brompton.\u201dFor 3 weeks I have been contemplating on writing a review because I was not sure whether a review will do this book justice. And I mean that because no matter how many reviews of this book will ever be written, it will surely have something that one will miss out, something that one will discover in his own ups and downs gained through his personal and social journey. But having stared at the closed book for what seems to be a long period after I have seemingly detached from its character, I have decided to write on it. I wouldn\u2019t call it a review, but rather an attempt to understanding what I might have misconceived and discovering what I might have not grasped. Or perhaps there is even no deeper meaning in the dark passages of the story like some might have observed it to be. But what is a better quest of enlightenment, no matter its breadth, than the one that makes us think, the one that challenges our intellect and shakes the core of our innate self-fulfilling prophecy? As most of Beckett\u2019s writings on the wall, Murphy reeks with elbowing one\u2019s way of purposeless journey. His stoic elaborates of characters and passive and imaginary development tries to reach to the ultimate core of a lost way. He doesn\u2019t even hint there might be the right way; a way at all but lack of purpose as the unconscious pursuit of all these faceless people that rush to reach the light, a light being nothing else but a spasm of the momentary. Whether it is Murphy Himself or any other of his pitiful entourage, the purpose is void in all directions. It is very often to distinguish between the characters of the story. They all look alike and they all seem to have the same meaningless self, joined into a single objective of obstruction. They are all the \u201cnothing new\u201d, that tale of freedom that is transferred from generation to generation to be ultimately lost in its quest within a whirlpool of thoughts and dubious aspirations. No wonder why he tries to depict Murphy as having a split personality, \u201csplit self\u201d, trying to distinguish between the imaginary and the less meaningful. Every character from Murphy\u2019s groupie couldn\u2019t care less about him, yet they anticipate, if not cherish his every move. Even his lover, Celia, who is gently depicted as a whore, finds in himself an escape from her situation. She pushes him to be someone who he is not only so that she fulfills her selfish desires of getting away of her dead-end street, without acknowledging any of his reflections and needs. In the end, she fulfills her dream of Murphy finding a job to get her off the street. In the end, he finds the peace that he had never sought of looking for \u2013 he finds sanity in the sanatorium. He finds madmen that makes all seems sane. He finds nothing in reality, but even that nothing makes him find a purpose that has never existed, a purpose that never started to exist. Beckett sets aside a whole chapter to describe Murphy\u2019s \u201cmind,\u201d which \u201cpictured itself as a large hollow sphere, hermetically closed to the universe without.\u201d The constant battle between body and mind he struggles with is perhaps the constant battle of finding that balance that could exist in the ideal world in which everyone prays to; a world in which no one believes in if there is not for that fake comfort of someone else they don\u2019t believe in either. For the first time in the novel, I have felt that Murphy found happiness once his ashes were spilt all over the vomit and the stale beer of the pub he had never intended to spread his light upon. Irrespective of his message, irrespective of the (mis)interpretation of his writing, the twist of words that his writing entails brings the reader in a superfluous state which could be either a confirmation of the struggle within, or perhaps a testimony of the fear that makes us what we are not.\u201cThe sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new. Murphy sat out of it, as though he were free, in a mew in West Brompton.\u201d I could have stopped reading at this point, and I would have still felt this was the novel that had educated me the most. For how many times have we felt out of it, as if we were free, and how many more times will be try to comfort ourselves in a beautiful illusion that might not be real?"}, {"userName": "Annie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie", "userReview": "Mmm, not for me.

It feels like he's trying so, so hard to make High Art, and the trying ruins it for me."}, {"userName": "Glen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3434392-glen", "userReview": "I am by no means a Beckett aficionado, having only read Waiting For Godot prior to this novel, but even so I was prepared for narrative weirdness, and Murphy does not disappoint. The central plot revolves around the title character, an Irishman recently transplanted to London to seek his fortune, and his friends, lovers, and interested followers and acquaintances who anxiously and passionately try to follow Murphy's every move and effort. The problem for them is that Murphy appears to be singularly uninterested in his own life, his chief pleasure apparently being that of being tied naked into a chair in the middle of his apartment. He eventually lands a job at a mental asylum where he has a fateful chess game with one of the inmates, and while I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone, I will say that while I rarely laugh out loud at anything I read in a novel, reading Murphy's instructions for the disposal of his remains provided one of those rare moments for me. A difficult but amusing novel that will leave you puzzled, tickled, and aghast all at the same time. For some reason I found myself thinking that if a demoniac comedian were to re-write the Book of Job, it might end up looking a lot like Murphy."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4714834-sarah", "userReview": "Holy hell, Samuel Beckett. To make sense of why I liked this is impossible. Beckett seems like the literary equivalent of a scientist. A crazy one that makes you laugh, too. It feels ridiculous to describe what Murphy is about: some guy who really likes his rocking chair is forced into job hunting by his ex-prostitute girlfriend. And there are a number of people looking for him. And he dies, which came as a shock, to me, at least. Mostly because he's irrational and is in an almost constant sleep paralysis, his death by burning seemed strangely unexpected. I didn't like that part.Murphy was one of the elect, who require everything to remind them of something else."}], "description": "Murphy, Samuel Beckett\u2019s first published novel, is set in London and Dublin, during the first decades of the Irish Republic. The title character loves Celia in a \u201cstriking case of love requited\u201d but must first establish himself in London before his intended bride will make the journey from Ireland to join him. Beckett comically describes the various schemes that Murphy employs to stretch his meager resources and the pastimes that he uses to fill the hours of his days. Eventually Murphy lands a job as a nurse at Magdalen Mental Mercyseat hospital, where he is drawn into the mad world of the patients which ends in a fateful game of chess. While grounded in the comedy and absurdity of much of daily life, Beckett\u2019s work is also an early exploration of themes that recur throughout his entire body of work including sanity and insanity and the very meaning of life.", "title": "Murphy", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8585893-murphy", "average": 3.86, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328822461l/8585893.jpg", "reviews": 266, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1433597.Samuel_Beckett", "name": "Samuel Beckett"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Classics", "European Literature", "Cultural", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8585893-murphy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/333314.Murphy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54033.Murphy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1201185.Murphy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16143246-murphy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13486030-murphy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1201184.Murphy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6467771-murphy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16028665-murphy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29855276", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19430907-murphy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11236870-murphy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17210182-murphy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17716.Waiting_for_Godot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12287.Endgame", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54028.Endgame_Act_Without_Words", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12279.Molloy_Malone_Dies_The_Unnamable", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/446542.Molloy"]}
