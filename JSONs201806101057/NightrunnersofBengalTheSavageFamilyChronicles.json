After almost three decades, it turns out I forgot almost all the details of the plot, other than the setting at the time of the Indian Sepoy Uprising in 1857. It is also apparent that the first time around I was more interested in the adventure elements of the story (opulent tiger hunts, harrowing escapes from blood crazed savages, gruesome murders, valiant cavalry charges, naked girls dancing, etc) than in the political implications and the evident bias of the narrator for the British point of view in the conflict.Briefly, Captain Rodney Savage is an officer in a Native regiment in Bhowani - an imaginary town bordering Kishanpur, a still independent Indian kingdom. After the Rajah of Kishanpur is murdered, Rodney is sent to pacify the city and to support the succession of his wife Sumitra Devi, who may have ordered the killing in the first place. In between dealing with his own social climber wife, corrupt political officers and saving the Rani's life during a tiger hunt, Rodney begins to gather intelligence about mysterious messages passed from village to village in the night, illegal arms smuggling, secret meetings, prophecies of doom from a holy man and general unrest among his soldiers and the general population. Rodney is assisted in his investigations by Caroline Langford, an earnest young lady who seems to have more empathy for the country and its people. When hell breaks loose, Rodney and Caroline try to escape towards a larger British garrison where a large scale confrontation with the rebels offers a grandiose finale to the novel.For the positive aspects, Masters knows his history stuff, not surprising given his five generations background in the Indian Army. He is also a skilled storyteller - this may be a debut novel with some unsubtle characterizations and forced plot twists, but the scenery, the unforgiving climate, the social life in the cantonment jump off the page in vivid and convincing colours. The pacing is good, although I believe too much time was spent in the build-up to the rebellion and too little afterwards.For the less savoury taste, Rodney is too evidently a product of the British Empire, strutting around Bengal as if he owned the place, taking for granted the numerous servants in every household and the loyalty of his troops. Much of the novel is spent in trying to find excuses for the excesses of his compatriots, to put the blame on bad apples and envy on the part of the Sepoys, to lionize the few Indians who remained loyal to their overlords. While acknowledging several of the mistakes in policy, like the forceful removal of native rulers and the indifference to local customs (see the issue of greased cartridges to caste conscious soldiers) , the major tonality of the argument is that the British are the best thing that could have happened to India, as they are the superior race with the better morals and better experience in governance. In my opinion, the only thing the British were better at was in fact ruthlessness and killing power. Here's an example of the delusional arguments Rodney likes to embrace: If the people here in Kishanpur rebelled and threw off the Rani, they would then ask the British to rule them in her stead - for they would never, of course, imagine they could rule themselves. and in another place: The English were conquerors here, not friends, and it was a ghastly mistake ever to forget it. There must be no peace and no quarter until every last Indian grovelled, and stayed grovelling. I may be accused in cherrypicking the quotes that best serve my own line of argument, and in all honesty, Rodney's views will be tempered towards the end of the novel, but I can't help positioning myself in this conflict on the side of the underdog, and this underdog is definitely not the smug, autocratic Brit officer. My final quote is a reply from a guru in a dialogue with Rodney: How would you like to be ruled at home by an Indian Company of merchant-adventurers? As an alternative read, Masters has two better novels set on the subcontinent (The Deceivers for adventure and Bhowani Junction for a more modern look at Anglo-Indian relations). My favorite romance epic of 1857 remains Shadow of the Moon by M M Kaye."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura", "userReview": "Page 199:It was not even yet an exact word, but a curse and a warning: This is the night.

(1951). John Masters. ****.\tThis was a reread of a book that I first read about forty years ago. John Masters started off his series about the Savage family in India with this one, although it is not first in the chronological sense. The plot here is based on the Indian Mutiny, or Sepoy Rebellion, of 1857. Captain Rodney Savage, an officer in the East India Company, begins to notice signs of unrest among his native troops. The Sepoys were an all volunteer group of Indians who signed up to serve in the military service, reporting to English officers. They were both Muslims and Hindus. The troubles began when the English began switching to a new rifle, with a new bullet load called dum-dums. The explosive power for these dum-dums was contained in a small envelope that had to be opened and then dumped into the rifle barrel before the bullet was put in. Normally, the Sepoys would open the package using their teeth to rip the paper wrapping apart. Word spread that the wrapping was lubricated with both cow and/or pig fat. This managed to offend both faiths, and led to murmurings among the troops. Officers of the various companies poo-pooed the whole thing, but it soon got out of hand. The incident was soon used by dissidents to fire up the troops, who soon began an organized and systematic killing of the English whites in the various cantonments. Savage \u2013 the grandson of William Savage who was instrumental in stamping out the Thugs \u2013 was one of the first English officers to see what was going on, and was instrumental in helping put down the insurrection. There\u2019s lots of adventure here, along with a goodly smattering of sex \u2013 enough to keep the most jaded reader\u2019s interest.

Masters writes with the descriptive depth of a professional soldier and a son of India. Surely as a child born (in Calcutta) during the Raj, of a family that had been there since the 18th century, Masters must've heard stories of the Rebellion from the outset of his life. I imagine he must've turned the possibilities and history of the event over and over in his head endlessly, and felt an overwhelming urge to make it the subject of his first novel. The end result is a page turner, written in an anguished tone. Fantastic book."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1040727-pam", "userReview": "Like other John Masters book, an extraordinary adventure period novel.

The book starts in 1856, in the fictional cantonment of Bhowani in Bengal India.The POV is Rodney Savage. He is a Captain of the 13th Rifles, Bengal Native Infantry. He is the leader of the Indian Sepoys, who make up the rank and file. He has spent years with them, and has respect and affection for them, though he believes in British superiority. His world is destroyed when he has to face that these same men want to kill him, and do kill other British.Rodney muses on the narrow and repressed life they must lead as Victorians. He blames it on Albert, and longs for the easier (socially) days of his father and grandfather.The book also brings up one of the secrets of the Raj, that those of middle and lower class were accorded 'Upper Class' status (grudgingly) in India because they were British and white. That group of people never wanted to go home, where they would return to their former lower-order life. In India they had servants, large houses, power and prestige.The country is divided into different British zones, with some princely states (they are dependent on the British to survive). Savage visits the Rani of Kishanpur, after her husband is killed. He spends time in the princely state and interacts with Indians who are technically their own masters.This book is 3rd book (Story Order) in the Savage Family series.The majority of the book looks at life in the cantonment, how the various Brits interact with each other and with the Indians all around them as soldiers and servants. There are British men, women and children, a whole mini social structure.Masters shows how they are beset by the little things, and miss or don't care about the important things. He also explores how the East India Company (which ran India), with remote businessmen make decisions that drive the Sepoys and their officers apart.About 2/3 of the way through the mutiny happens and the pace picks up. There is very little of the aftermath in the book.I thought the writing was a bit stiff, not sure if Masters was trying to be Victorian, or if it is because it is the first book in the series published."}, {"userName": "Larry", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2728477-larry", "userReview": "The Indian Revolt of 1857 against the East India Company's rule was a two-year-long series of crimes and brutal acts against mostly civilians, first by the Sepoy mutineers and then by the English. It began as a revolt against the Company's officials and military leaders, but spread almost immediately to include the dependents and hangers-on of those first targets. The English reprisals that followed were brutal, and the overall effect of the mutineers' (revolutionaries') defeat was a complete takeover of India by the British Crown, and the creation of what we know as the Raj. Masters, who rose to the rank of colonel in the British Indian Army, has sympathy for both sides, though he recognizes the Company's distance from the people of India. His recreation of the mutiny is centered on the town of Bhowani, a fictional place that occurs in a couple of his novels, though it is situated roughly where Jansi is located. (The fort in Jansi, and the Rani's palace, both still stand, and have been well maintained, as does most of the fort at Gwalior where the mutineers were broken.) His main character, Rodney Savage is both headstrong and sympathetically drawn, though he is torn between vengeance and sorrow.

Masters uses the Savage family (interesting choice of name) throughout his India chronicles, so in this book, we have Rodney Savage, with a front row seat to his Sepoy battalion rebelling within the local fort.Within the English community, Savage is surrounded by ignorance, with oblivious and bigoted colleagues; he has a wife he doesn't love - one of many idle women nitpicking pettily about each other - and is the recipient of difficult questions he doesn't want to hear from an annoying bluestocking (he and I both disliked her early on, but she grew on us). The questions she asks ultimately make him sense the rot within the system, and make him re-examine his place in India, his life, and himself.Rodney is left with the choice to hide with additional English survivors and friendly? locals until rescued, give into the blood lust and seek revenge whenever possible, or attempt to prevent subsequent rebellions that he knows will occur as local rajahs work to systematically - and bloodily - eradicate all Europeans from their lands and the organized rebellion works its way through India.As he works through emotional and physical survival, Rodney also looks with new eyes at how his colleagues respond to the emergency and India.Lately I've been counting the number of pages left in a book to see how far I have to go before I'm done. I don't know if this is because I'm tired when I read or because many of the books on my stack looked good, but just aren't that fascinating once they're cracked open. Regardless, I didn't do that once with this 373-page Souvenir edition.

With this re-reading of the book I find myself more critical of the British in India and favor the \"rightness\" of India Home Rule. Though it was interesting to note that villagers were acccustomed to being ruled and really, it didn't matter who they were. Were the British better or more fair than others? Hard to say. Judging by the behavior exhibited by the British military and their paternalistic attitude to their native troops, I would tend to be on the side of the sepoys. They, however, were caught up in the intrigue of the Rajahs, Ranis and other local rulers. The situation was highly complex.Masters writes of a brutal time with atrocities committed on both sides. I found myself searching the the internet for the history of the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857. For me the sign of a good book is if it prompts me to learn more about the time, the place or the events.

It is a breath of fresh air to read something about a grey world, a foreigner describing their foreign home and how dark it can become in war. While the first half of the book is gripping and wonderfully put together to create many wholesome, imperfect but sympathetic characters, it is the change from white women in petticoats playing crochet to sepoys murdering babies in their cribs that grips you into the true message of the story, almost being convinced with the main character that these people who are trying to reclaim their homeland are monsters before remembering the reality of the situation and it\u2019s bigger picture. Something that was also refreshing is how unheroic the main character is. He\u2019s not a saviour but a broken man in a country that wants him dead and he is not about to the day, he can barely save himself and those he loves.
