Loved, loved, loved. It was flippant and fun, total escapism, with a minxy heroine I adored from the first page, a long list of exotic locales to divert, and piles of dramatic intrigue to keep me engaged.Set in the late 1880s through 1910s, the story follows May Dugas, a small town Michigan girl with a foxy figure, clever mind, and an impatience with ordinary life. Told in first person, May's 'voice' is sophisticated, wily, artificially innocent, glib. The novel opens in 1917, with May on trial, accused of swindling more than $50,000 from a former friend, Miss Frank Shaver. Returned to her childhood hometown of Menominee, Michigan, May has been dubbed by the Pinkertons as 'the most dangerous woman in America'. (And without having murdered a soul!) Notorious, rich, and titled (she's a baroness now!), May tells the reader the truth of how she came to that point. (I didn't put truth in quotes because I've decided she's sharing the truth -- I'm like her innumerable suitors, smitten past the point of reason!)May reminded me of Lola Montez, another notorious adventuress with lovers and scandals trailing behind her like the train on her dress. May's story strains credulity until you remember, like Ms. Montez, May was a real woman. Biaggio does a wonderful job of making May's escapades seem feasible, albeit excessive, and I was with her every ill-timed, poorly-conceived, and ambitiously bold step of the way.The other characters in the book -- especially the men -- are rather flat (and I don't think that's a bad thing!), but that's to be expected with May. She's the star of her own story, and with good reason: men are drawn to her for same reasons we are. Biaggio balances May's self-centered ruminations, justifications, and pep talks with lovely tidbits and details about the era, setting, clothes, and mores. (Biaggio doesn't stint on describing May's flashy jewels and I could practically see them winking at me from between the lines.)The novel alternates with the trial and May's account of her life. I will say, I've recently tired of dual story lines, especially when they break up the flow and action of the story, but in this case, I actually enjoyed the two timelines. Both lines are fascinating, and thankfully Biaggio ends each chapter neatly, with no wild cliffhangers -- which means I can go into the new chapter relatively relaxed. (Relatively, as overall, I couldn't stop mentally screaming, 'So how does it all end for May?!')I think this would make a wonderful audiobook due to the first-person narration and May's lively tone. Despite May's sexual prowess, this book is light on tawdry details, so no need to worry about detailed or flowery descriptions of her and her lovers. In the end, this was a straight up enjoyable novel -- the kind of book that sucked me in, made me miss my subway stops, and had me reading as I walked up the sidewalk home. If you like your hist fic with a hint of grandeur and a heavy dollop of drama, consider this!"}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3820197-jill", "userReview": "3.5 starsIn 1917 May Dugas was placed on trial for extortion. She was considered at the time as one of the most dangerous women in the world by the Pinkerton Detective Agency. Born in a small village north-west of Chicago in 1869 into an ordinary family, she charmed her way into high society in America and Europe. Beautiful, resourceful, cunning, May used all her wiles to seduce men and gain an advantage in life. Narrated by May Parlor Games opens in 1917 with May on trial, with flashbacks in alternating chapters to her earlier life. Throughout the years and across the world, May was tracked by Pinkerton Agency detective Reed Dougherty, determined to catch her out and bring her to justice.Though I did find May Dugas and her exploits, interesting, even entertaining, I found her character ultimately, unlikable. The writing style and prose were wonderful, with the first person narrative, engaging. I wanted to find May charmingly adventurous, instead I found her disconcertingly self-absorbed and opportunistic. Always looking for a man to financially benefit her life, travelling from one country to another taking lovers, she came across to me as more mercenary than daring or audacious.I think this aptly sums up May's attitude -\"And after all, men are not terribly difficult to manage. They are rather like dogs: Roll them on their back and convince them you're master and you've tamed them.\"Readers who don\u2019t necessarily need to like the main character or need an emotional investment in the main character, will enjoy this story of May Dugas. It is well-written, easy to read and entertaining.ARC courtesy of Random House (Doubleday) via Edelweiss"}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2679341-jane", "userReview": "Where I got the book: purchased from Amazon. Maryka is a friend.I jumped on this novel, friend or no friend, because of the cover\u2014a gorgeous piece of design\u2014and the era. Plus, the promise of naughty goings-on in Chicago parlor houses, which were the better brothels.Alas, the blurb is massively deceptive on that point. This is, in fact, biographical fiction covering thirty years in the life of May Dugas, who was a real person. She starts out as a girl from a very ordinary family in Menominee, in the upper peninsula of Michigan. Her amorous nature gets her into trouble that serves as her excuse for going to Chicago, and it\u2019s while she\u2019s trying to survive in the big city that her stint in a parlor house comes in, but it\u2019s way too short. Which is a pity because the story of how May survives in Chicago and why she has to leave could easily fill a novel, and includes a scene that for me was the highlight of the book.But in real life May got up to a whole lot more, and Parlor Games follows her career. The story of May\u2019s life is framed by a court case in 1917, when May was sued by a former friend\u2014but that doesn\u2019t stop it from being episodic, as you\u2019d expect in the case of an adventuress who periodically has to pick up and start again. I couldn\u2019t help liking May, and I loved the way she (since she\u2019s telling the story) always slants it slightly so she\u2019s in her best light, leaving the court case to cast doubt on the reliability of her narrative. If you believe May, nothing is entirely her fault\u2014a very creditable character flaw, and one with which I\u2019m well acquainted.There were some lovely scenes and well-paced dialogue, and if you\u2019re a fan of life-story fiction you\u2019ll enjoy the changes of location and May\u2019s ability to pull herself out of one situation after another. I prefer a novel with a stronger center, a definite source of conflict or desire, so for me this is a 3.5 star read for the quality of the writing and the clarity of the plotting."}, {"userName": "Kerrie", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3202093-kerrie", "userReview": "If you're a reader who must absolutely without question LOVE the main character, this is not the book for you.History doesn't have a good picture of May Dugas, considering that she never provided her own version of her life. The only account is a series of newspaper articles from the 1940s as told by one of the detectives involved in chasing her around the world. History is always written by the winners, isn't it?Fictionalized biographies like this are ripe for whitewashing a character or presenting \"the other side\" and rehabilitating a vilified character and this one is no exception. Or is it? Just take a look at the facts of May's life and run-ins with the law - she wasn't exactly the most kosher, moral and upstanding 19th century lady. She's an unreliable narrator on the grandest scale and you can't believe a single word she says.But poor May, you can't help but root for her in the beginning. Well aware that the podunk backwaters of the Michigan UP aren't good enough for someone like her, she heads off to Chicago to make her fortune. Working in a brothel with an eye to scoring a wealthy patron, she has her first run-in with the law when venturing into the world of shady business deals. A girl can make a mistake once, right? But May never can put down roots for long, and after getting used to living in style, she uses any means necessary to maintain that lifestyle. Doesn't a girl deserve that much?The storyline bounces back and forth between her past and the 1917 trial when one of her erstwhile companions, a Miss Frank Gray Shaver, sued her for extortion to the tune of $100,000. Miss Shaver blew through her entire inheritance giving money to May and her family, and claims that she was pressed into signing a document that released May from all obligation to pay back the loans. Honestly, who's to say who's at fault here. But when you see how often this cycle repeated itself with May, you know something's rotten in Denmark.The author explores the possibility that the lawsuit was sparked by Frank's lesbian overtures being rejected (although May was not adverse to Sapphic love if it got her what she wanted), but that's all artistic license.There was actually quite a bit of humor in this story - May's self-awareness of what she does is nonexistent. Despite spending her entire life as the parasitic arm candy of one meal ticket after another, she makes claims that she has ALWAYS stood on her own two feet. As if. And her anger and frustration whenever the Pinkerton agent pops up to upset her best-laid plans is amusing - how DARE he always show up when she's about to evade the law and get away scot-free? Can't a girl get a break in life? I ask you...Leslie Carroll's narration for the audiobook was only OK this time around, but I chalk that up to the fact that this wasn't her book that she was reading. That was a disappointment, since her reading of Becoming Marie Antoinette just blew me away."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4439671-jennifer", "userReview": "The settings in Parlor Games were amazing. London, New York, Shanghai, etc., but the same Pinkerton Agency detective keeps tracking May down in these cities. How? It didn't seem reasonable to me. Maybe I can't imagine finding people in the years before the internet? May changed her name and moved frequently but Detective Doherty kept showing up at inopportune times. (Just in time to foil her plans!)I wasn't able to connect with May. I would have liked to have understood her better, to hear her thoughts and justifications for her actions. I may have liked this book more if I had a clue about May's motives. Is she trying to help support her family by conning and conniving her way through life? That reason didn't hold up for me as she treats her family members shabbily at best.Parlor Games did contain enjoyable sections. I was intrigued by the extortion trial. Those were my favorite parts of the book and the only place I felt I was learning a bit more about the characters. That was what I wanted more of. I loved the idea of this book because I love learning about history and real historical characters. Unfortunately this book fell flat for me.Parlor Games was apparently inspired by the real life of May Dugas. I'm wondering if a nonfiction account would work better for me?

The narrative is first person, but you never feel as though you are missing out on anything. In a lot of cases, in first person narrative, the view is too restricted. Not so in this.It goes from a trial (and we are left very much in suspense over what exactly is going on btw Frank and her and this trial) and the heroine's past misdeeds.I lost interest halfway through, however, when I realized the woman is well, to put it bluntly, another whore. I don't find whores that interesting anymore. Simply read too many whore books. I was expecting more crime and excitement than selling her body and lying and trying to nab a rich husband.So I am disappointed. The woman travels from Chicago to San Fran to China, sleeping with men, making them spend money on her, and trying to nab a rich one in marriage. I didn't grow to like her at all, and for me to sit down and enjoy a book, I have to somewhat like the heroine or at least sympathize with her. By the time I hit the halfway point, I didn't care what she did next or what man she slept with.However, I liked the author's writing style/voice, and I would read more work by her in the future.

This novel features all of that, yet our flawed heroine is so engaging, and so honest, despite her obvious manipulation, that I really enjoyed this book. It's a novelized version of a real life con artist May Dugas. I don't want to give too much away, but it follows the journey of May, who moves to Chicago to have the child of her first boyfriend from Michigan and plans to give it up for adoption before she comes back to marry him. He gives her some funds, and she expects to be gone for 10 months or so. But on the train, May gets her period and -whoops!- since she's already on her way, she might as well stay. Well, her funds run out, and getting men to buy her dinner becomes more difficult. What can May do, esp since she has no interest in moving back to Michigan? May innocently engages in prostitution, and uses men, sex and the appearance of wealth and comfort to travel all over the world (San Francisco, China, Japan, London, Cairo, New York). She meets men, falls in love, marries, and lives with a husband, and none of the men are the same! This was my favorite sentence from the book:All I ever wanted was a respectable and happy life. Yes, I admit it, I desired the ease that wealth brings, but not money simply for money's sake; money so that I might enjoy travel, fine dining and exotic sights in the company of someone I loved.Fans of The Great Gatsby might also like this novel."}, {"userName": "Paul Pessolano", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4877713-paul-pessolano", "userReview": "\u201cParlor Games\u201d by Maryka Biaggio, published by Doubleday.Category \u2013 Fiction/LiteratureThe reader may take this as fiction/literature surrounded by a true story, or a true story surrounded by fiction literature, regardless it is a fascinating book.This is the story of May Dugasv, in the book May Dugas, a wily woman belonging to the 1900\u2019s. Although little is know of May Dugasv, Maryka Biaggio takes what is known and weaves a tale of a con artist extraordinaire.The story is told with the exploits of May interspersed with her trial for extortion.May, as a teen, knew that she had high aspirations as she left her small town for Chicago. She expected to find a handsome and rich man, only to find herself, in desperation, a prostitute in a high end bordello. She uses her experience and savvy to forge a better life for herself. May becomes involved with several men that can provide her with the riches and position she sorely sought. However, with each amorous affair she is foiled by Reed Dougherty of the Pinkerton Detective Agency. She is haunted by him as Jean Valjean was haunted by Javert in Les Miserables.A wonderful story that will keep the reader wondering, until the very end, how and if May will extradite herself from her situation. A story of a very cunning woman that uses everyone to her advantage and makes them feel good about it.

However, the book was quite detailed, and I found myself completely pulled into the story of May, and all her little adventures - so it took me longer than expected, but it was worth every second! The part I really enjoyed, was that while this book is a work of fiction, the story is based on a real person. I found this enthralling, and a nice little addition at the end of the story.The book starts out with May asking you, the reader, to go through her story and determine if she did any wrong, and to form your own opinions based on a life of cirmcumstances and events. I found that this immediately pulled me into the tale and made me think more about the events on the pages, rather than devouring another book at rapid speed. Mays' adventures span continents, and many many people. Chicago. New York. London. Hong Kong. Toyko. And others. So many destinations, and written with such detail it was quite easy to imagine you where there living it along with her, and seeing the sites. It does span her life, but frequently brings you back to the trial she is in the midst of, where she is defendant against an old friend of hers, Frank Shaver. Some people find these little jolts of time hard to comprehend, but I found that in this book they made perfect sense and happened at approprate times, which not many authors manage. The only issue I had, was the charges against May that her friend bought for all the money. While discussed at length, from Franks point of view during the trial, nothing is said from May's point of view about those actual \"events\". In the story of her live, anything that involved Frank is skimmed over, and not discussed much from Mays' viewpoint, so it's kind of hard to be the Judge and Jury like she is asking. (Unless of course you assume she was doing to Frank what she did to countless men...well, then the answer is pretty obvious!).I enjoyed it. I wouldn't call her a likeable heroine, but a very enjoyable book. One of few where you find you don't really \"like\" any of the characters, but you are still drawn in just the same, and completely satisfied when it is over. Happy, content, and thoughtfull on all that happened.This is Maryka Biaggio's first work of ficton, but I do hope she writes more, and I would love to read them!"}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58790-kimberly", "userReview": "I received this ARC courtesy of Doubleday.Parlor Games is the story of May Dugas told as if May was writing the story herself. I will admit, going into the book I didn't realize May was a real person. The book centers around a trial and the life of May is told as the trial unfolds. It's written as a first person narrative, but it isn't annoying or self indulging. I felt like I was sitting down listening to the story and dying to know what happens. It did start off somewhat slow just because the back and forth between the trial and the life story of May didn't really pull me in at first. There wasn't enough story told of one before it jumped back to the other. I understand that was to build suspense, but it was too much suspense and left me not really into the story. It did eventually pick up once I got into the story enough to be engaged and want to know what happens next. The other place it lost me was the ending. At the point in the book where it ended, I needed more to finish the story of May. It felt like too much time was spent in other places that should have been saved for the ending and the conclusion of what happened to her at that point. I am not a fan of this in series books so I certainly don't like it in a stand alone. Especially once you find out May is a real person and there seem to be little to no books written on her, you want her book to have a real ending.Other than those two issues, I did like the story of May. I think that it is fascinating how she lived and how she kind of made her own rules and bent the existing rules when necessary to get her way. This book didn't drag at all and really made me want to learn more about her, which is always a requirement for a historical fiction read in my opinion. It's a good read and there were many moments where I was annoyed with my schedule because I wanted to sit down to finish the book (which is why I NEED a good ending!). I think that anyone who is interested in hearing a story of a woman who is a little bit outlaw and a lot of her own boss will like this one."}, {"userName": "Kelli", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5857541-kelli", "userReview": "I won Parlor Games, a book by Maryka Biaggio, in a Goodreads giveaway. I started reading it as soon as I received it. The only reason it took me so long to finish it was because of life and how busy it can be. The book was very entertaining. Very good plot, very good writing and very good suspense. The book and its twists and turns kept me turning from one page to another eagerly waiting to see what would happen next. I also loved how so many details were given to the background and history of the late 1800s, early 1900s. With that being said, I did not like May Dugas. While she was honest and straightforward to us, her \u201cdear\u201d readers, I did not like how she treated others in her life especially her family. She was very charming and engaging, but at the same time, she seemed to be a sociopath. She didn\u2019t seem to care who she hurt along the way while focusing on the prize (having all the money in the world to live happily and comfortably). May\u2019s love for Johnny and Alonso did seem convincing, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think she had the same feelings for them like a normal woman would have for a man. While May may not have tried to take them for all they had like she did with the other people she met, she did ultimately hurt them in the end. In short, May was a con-artist and needless to say, I don\u2019t care for a person like that. And, don\u2019t even get me started on May\u2019s \u201cfriend,\u201d Frank Shaver. That woman made my skin crawl. Also, I was very confused on how the Pinkerton detective, Reed Doherty, was able to keep finding May no matter where she was or what name she was going by. I can\u2019t figure out how someone can be found back in the old days, long before the Internet was even invented. I just kept thinking, if a lowly woman like May Dugas could be found so easily, couldn\u2019t they have found the identity of Jack the Ripper who killed in the late 1880s? One more thing, I found the cover picture to be a little misleading. It showed a pair of women who looked like flappers in the Roaring Twenties, which took place after the book ended.

May starts by trying to sweet-talk the reader. We know her \"inner\" character immediately--she's a con-artist. May moves through this book with her eye always on the main-chance; if she's smart enough to survive, why shouldn't she prosper at the same time. May is developed in terms of actions and I can't think of a better way to explore a sociopathic personality. The driving force of May Dugas' life is action/reaction, not inner reflection. She careens from one cliff-hanger to another--sometimes improving her financial or social status along the way.May is quick witted, a quick study,has \"gumption\", and is determined not to live life as a poor person if better odds are within reach. Using her beauty (and the charm she picks up along the way) as a tool upon rich men, she repeatedly improves her odds. But, rich men are not without their own weapons; throughout the book, May is haunted by a Pinkerton detective, hired by rich men. The Pinkerton man often drives the crises in this book, which in turn drive the non-stop action.Another interesting characteristic of this book is attention to period detail--architecture, clothing, luxury items, etc. May Dugas, the quick study, picks up on the details she needs to know to move in her preferred circles. She sees the surface details of the life of the rich and absorbs them almost by osmosis--that is her character development.As a fan of Patricia Highsmith's Ripley series (and the TV series Dexter), I enjoyed May Dugas' story for the guilty pleasure of rooting for a charming and quick-witted criminal (though May omitted murder from her bag of tricks). What's amazing is that May was real and the major events in Parlor Games did happen. Using the major true events as a framework, the author has invented and fleshed out a convincingly engaging story of the in-between events that get May Dugas from major event A to major event B and so on.This is a fast-paced and fun read telling of the roller coaster life of a genuine picaresque \"heroine\"."}, {"userName": "Farah Ng", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6829220-farah-ng", "userReview": "Review from brokenpenguins.comThank you to Doubleday for sending me an advanced reading copy of Parlor Games by Maryka Biaggio in exchange for an honest review.What can I say about Maryka Biaggio\u2019s Parlor Games? It\u2019s fun, carefree and most importantly, it\u2019s utterly scandalous. Parlor Games is a whirlwind memoir of May Dugas\u2019 adventures around the world. Based on a true story, May Dugas is part con artist, part whore and mostly genius.She befriends aristocratic men in exchange for money, diamonds and fancy trips around the world. Born in a small town to a poor family, it\u2019s all May can do if she wants to see the world and live life like a baller. People get hurt but May mostly cares about May\u2019s needs so when things get bad, May gets out.And it\u2019s mostly because of a certain Pinkerton Agency spy who repeatedly spoils May\u2019s plans and outs her for being the conscience-free scam artist she really is. Talk about kill-joy.Based at the turn of the 19th century, May starts the story off by telling you about how a woman named Frank is suing her. May isn\u2019t the least bit remorseful and at the end of the day; there are no hard lessons learned here. But May\u2019s charm and joie de vivre will have you forgetting her wrongs.I highly recommend Parlour Games to those who enjoy Downton Abbey, The American Heiress and The Virgin Cure.

Her May Dugas, however, also comes with a liberal dose of Thackeray's Becky Sharp. May leaves her small hometown to travel to Chicago. Supposedly to help support her family, but May is the epitome of an unreliable narrator. She really goes to Chicago to find the bright lights, big city glamor and adoration she craves. And the money. And jewels. Sex seems to be unimportant to her, a niggling responsibility she must get out of the way to get to the things she wants. And so her adventures go. She moves from bordello to an apartment set up for her by a lover; when she's bored or the money isn't enough anymore or a Pinkerton detective (Reed Doherty) shows up promising to ruin her fun, she moves to a new city and finds another sugar daddy. Along the way she marries a short lived Dutch Baron and then takes off again, Reed Doherty still in pursuit.The complications along the way have to do with the bad company she chooses, or her basically felonious nature, or both. That's for the reader to figure out.

Yet, I never got around to checking it out. My sister actually got me this book. So I finally had a chance to check this book out. I have never heard of May Dugas. Yet I am drawn to these types of stories of strong women and this time period. When you mix these two elements with a really good writer, you get a lovely book like Parlor Games by Maryka Biaggio. I did not feel like May was ever a victim. In fact, I kind of thought of her as a cool hero. The guys she took advantage of I could not even feel sorry for as well. They either deserved it or if they thought they could rein May in, they were too gullible. The chase between May and Reed was entertaining. I would say they both were on equal playing fields when it came to who had the upper hand.

I am only giving it a four star rating though as before reading the book, I read the synopsis on the back and she was portrayed as dangerous con artist so I thought it was going to be a really juicy read but I was quite disappointed that it wasn't as juicy as I thought and I don't feel she was a dangerous con artist. I felt she was more misunderstood and she just wanted to better her life but made a couple of bad choices such as entering a bordello and choice in companion very early on but that was when she was starting out. She was more of a victim. When she got engaged to Dale and then Robby, both of whom she fell in love with and could offer her a better life, he only reason why she ended up leaving them with a large amount of money was due to the parents hiring a detective to find out her background, didn't like what they found out and bribed her to leave the men. She really had no choice it was either not take the money and be ruined and not ever have an opportunity to marry well but still have to leave or take the money and try to make a fresh start somewhere else.Meeting Carlyle in China when her friend ran off, again she was a victim and was deceived by him and he gave her money for her discretion so his wife wouldn't find out about his affairs. She then had a seemingly happy marriage to the Baron for many years and only got divorced because he felt she had abandoned him when she had written to him on lots of occasions saying she was helping both her family and his but yet he still insisted on a divorce. As far as it was written in the book there wasn't really any settlement on the divorce as he divorced her in holland on the basis of abandonment and didn't have to give her anything. Then she got into a spot of bother with a man who gambled and had such a bad temper. He then attempted to sue her, she knew there was no winning against him so befriended him again to make him drop the suit out of desperation and then ran away to begin again, a fresh start.With the whole trial with Frank going on as well, this was all very interesting but felt it was all so vague as to how it actually came to that situation. It referenced a friendship over years but there wasn't much elaboration on the friendship and all the trips the girls supposedly went on so I felt the inclusion of the trial between the ladies didn't flow well into the story neither did why May was actually back in Menominee at that particular time. It referenced it was because of the war but it felt there was a big chunk missing from the narrative to make this flow a little easier.I know that the book is written from the point of view of May Duggas herself and that she would of course make herself to be the victim in everything but the book is written as more of a memoir of her life so why hold back as to what her motives actually were if she was meant to be this dangerous con artist? It just doesn't match the feel of the synopsis that you read on the back of the book it is almost like I was meant to read something completely different to what I have done.To have made her more into a dangerous con artist there needed to have been more situations where she had done something a lot more scandalous and risky. I just don't really understand how she conned the Baron, Robby, Dale, Frank or any of the other men featured in the book for that matter. The only crime that was evident was when she stole blatantly from the coffee merchant but only on her friends bidding. It's a great story, don't get me wrong but it doesn't say what it says on the tin."}, {"userName": "Bev", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5082359-bev", "userReview": "Parlor Games by Maryka Biaggio is a sweeping piece of historical fiction based on real-life adventuress, May Dugas aka the Baroness May de Vries (and various aliases). The story opens with May settling in for a trial accusing her of extortion--bilking her friend Miss Frank Gray Shaver out of her inheritance. Sandwiched in between scenes from the courtroom drama, May tells us the story of her life--all the adventures that led up to her appearance in court in January 1917.May's father dies fairly early in her life and she decides to set out for Chicago in the hopes of earning enough money to support her family. But Chicago in the late 1800s is not welcoming to a young woman with no skills and she soon finds herself a courtesan in the city's most infamous bordello. Taking what she learns there, she uses her great beauty and feminine charms to encourage her gentlemen to bestow gifts upon her. It looks like her dreams are coming true when she makes friends with two young women from Chicago's high society and is introduced to a financially secure young man. She can already hear the wedding bells ringing when Reed Dougherty, a Pinkerton detective, spoils her nuptial plans. It won't be the last time that Dougherty pops up at the most inopportune moment.From Chicago May works her way around the world to Portland and San Francisco to Shanghai and Holland to London and Hong Kong. She goes from the top of the world and the riches of her dreams while married to the Baron to moments of despair when Dougherty foils her plans. She goes through money like water and winds up mixed up in politics, insurance fraud, scandalous affairs, wartime speculations, and various legal proceedings. The Pinkerton Agency eventually dubs her the \"most dangerous woman in the world\"--accusing her of being a blackmailer and a heartless seducer of the wealthiest of men. This is May's story--told in the first person as she goes on trial for extortion--and she asks the reader to be her judge. She asks us to believe that she is completely honest in her narration and for us to deliver judgment on what we read. Is she the cold hearted swindler who breaks hearts even as she empties bank accounts or have her actions been justified?On the one hand, this is a fascinating look at the late 19th/early 20th centuries in America. Showing the reader what life was like for young women without money and without decent job prospects--not that I believe for a moment that May would have wanted to stick to a regular job if it had been available to her. I just can't see her working at the same job for years on end. That girl was born wanting money--and lots of it. Biaggo's writing style is spot on--May's voice is distinctive and draws the reader right in. I easily finished the book in two days (less when you consider that there was sleeping and chores and work that had to be attended to). But....I can't say that liked May. If the goal was to convince me that May's actions were justified over the course of her tale, then I'm afraid the mission failed. May strikes me as unscrupulous and out for herself with the final chapter forcefully driving that home. The only point where I really felt for her was when she lost her Johnny, but I'm still not convinced that her heart was nearly as broken as she would have us believe. Three stars for a solid tale, interesting historical detail, and terrific narration.This was first posted on my blog My Reader's Block. Please request permission before reposting.

I love historical fiction, and in this impressive first novel, Biaggio has clearly done her research and woven it into a fast-paced and spellbinding tale. The exquisite descriptions about the surroundings and fashions of the turn of the last century placed me squarely in that era.I'd never heard of the main character, May Dugas, before reading this book. Apparently she was the subject of a Pinkerton investigation and a well-publicized trial. Biaggio takes you back-and-forth between her protagonist\u2019s description of this trial and the events of this woman's very colorful life.May is a woman who lives in a time when women were expected to marry and raise families. It is clear from the beginning that May wanted a more exciting life, she set out to get it, and indeed she did. And the story of how she did is fascinating, and most of all, fun to read.The book quotes the Pinkerton Detective who pursued her through much of her life as referring to her as: \"The most dangerous woman in the world\". When I first read that, I expected she was going to be involved in in some type of criminal activity that would erode my sympathy for her. At the very least I thought I would feel something akin to my feelings about Bonnie of the notorious Bonnie and Clyde Barrow\u2019s gang. However, May lived in a time when a woman was considered extremely dangerous, perhaps mostly because she was able to manipulate men into getting what she wanted. Ironically, at this very time, the male dominated world was destroying a global economy without repentance or reservation. May certainly uses her feminine beauty and wiles to extort fortunes from men willing to fall into her orbit. But as a reader, she also captivated me, and I eagerly followed her unfolding life of drama, intrigue, and cunning. Although sometimes I wasn\u2019t always sure whether I admired or disapproved of May, mostly I came to understand and sympathize with a powerful woman who used the resources that she had to succeed in a world that did not welcome strong women.Often when I finish a work of historical fiction, I immediately want to know more about what the other facts of the case were and where the author embellished to fill out this compelling novel. In this regard, Parlor Games is no different. I am left with many questions about this woman's life and times, and I am very tempted to do some research on my own to learn more about her."}, {"userName": "Alice Bola", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5476774-alice-bola", "userReview": "When I think of the most dangerous woman in America, the last person I think about is a wannabe socialite from Menominee, Michigan. But that is exactly what the Pinkerton Detective Agency dubbed our protagonist May Dugas.This novel is deliciously entertaining. I really loved the cat and mouse game between May and Reed Doherty, the Pinkerton detective. Just when I had forgotten about him, he would pop up to foil May\u2019s plan once again. I also loved reading May\u2019s adventures. She was quite the world traveler. I loved her moxie and her opportunistic ways. She never gave up and did what she had to in order to have a better life. She was selfless in the way that these desires extended to her family as well. She wanted a better life for them. I think that is what I enjoyed the most about this novel. May wasn\u2019t this cunning dangerous woman, she was resourceful. Parlor Games has a wonderful cast of supporting characters. I especially loved the spunky Daisy and May\u2019s husband, the respected Dutch Baron Rudolph de Vries. I love the stability the Baron offered May and Daisy was simply fantastic. Daisy is the one character that made me wish Parlor Games wasn\u2019t written in first person. I would have loved to get inside Daisy\u2019s head for a bit. Maybe Ms. Biaggio will take the foundation of Daisy and write another novel based on her. Yes, I would like that very much. Ms. Biaggio is a gifted writer however there were times when the transition from scene to scene wasn\u2019t smooth. Also, the thing that wasn\u2019t clear to me was May\u2019s friendship with Frank. Their first go-around was recounted thoroughly however their second attempt at a friendship was told through court testimony only. I felt a little cheated. I wanted to know May\u2019s point of view and that lack of knowledge made it very difficult for me to side with her. The author added much vivid detail yet at times, glazed over the minor things that would have really pulled the story together, mainly what exactly happened with May and Frank.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel up until the end. I had rooted for May throughout Parlor Games but in the end, I was left shaking my head in wonder if she really was cunning and deceitful. Maybe that is the point. Once May stopped talking and weaving a web of lies, all that is left is fact and truth. And the truth is maybe the Pinkerton Detective Agency is right."}, {"userName": "Melinda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2299071-melinda", "userReview": "Parlor Games is a fictionalized account of Mary Dugas, a female con artist from a small Michigan town.

The first person perspective provided an intimate view of the heroine at the center of \u201cParlor Games.\u201d Whether calling herself May, Pauline, the Baroness, or any other name, May\u2019s conniving character was completely engaging! The writing evoked an elegant quality which served to lure me into believing May was a refined woman of the early 1900\u2032s rather than a calculating social climber seeking out her next victim. As with any book told in multiple time frames, I tend to prefer one story over the other. Here, I was more interested in May\u2019s recount of her life\u2019s struggles than in the trial where she was accused of defrauding a future friend, but both were interesting.I wouldn\u2019t normally have liked our heroine since her cunning nature is a bit unforgiving. But the author created a character who had just enough innocence to redeem her. May flits from one city to the next, with a \u201cfly by the seat of your pants\u201d attitude that inevitably lands her into compromising situations. Although her goal is to live off a rich man, ultimately she is taken advantage of almost as much as she takes advantage of others. The excitement of May\u2019s life is enhanced with the constantly changing setting. Neither the reader, nor May, knows where she will end up next. Her travels through Chicago, New York, London, Mexico, and Hong Kong, help to portray the extravagant and ever-changing life May leads. What I liked most about the novel was that the story never slowed down. The quick plot changed every few pages, which made this a face paced story that was impossible not to love.I enjoyed everything about this book and wish there were more like it!

The lilting language helped capture the era and Mary\u2019s geographical and emotional travels were beautifully illustrated, enjoyable and compelling. I was thoroughly immersed in Mary\u2019s story as she travelled through the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. She created a path that promised either serious trouble or significant rewards and, as a result, accumulated successes, failures, joy and heartbreak. The story showed how a person with restricted options, resolutely against earning money from prostitution, pursued every one of her choices with great dedication. All the scenes were handled without sensationalism and I particularly liked that Mary did not go to great lengths to justify or apologise for her actions. In a world where men usually inherited money, land and businesses and were afforded an education, a woman's options were very different.So many books about women who do not toe society\u2019s line, agonise in explaining some honourable, family-based, motive or a secret torment. This completely ignores the fact that women are not all driven by socially accepted values. Mary wanted a glittering life and she did all she could to get it given the social constraints of her time. I was impressed that Mary achieved so much and sincerely hope that most of the tales were from May Dugas actual life. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and was carried along with Mary/May's highs and lows from the comfort of 21st century Europe \u2026 and what a comfort that is!

Just as I would find myself getting bored of the lack of one main quest (as I am used to) I would be sucked back in by some new turn of events! My only note is that the ending fell just barely short of being perfectly satisfying. There was some awesome build up and tension at the end but the conclusion itself didn't quite manage to tie everything up in the perfect little bow that I expected.
