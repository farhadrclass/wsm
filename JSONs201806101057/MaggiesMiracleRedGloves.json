When I saw the red glove series on Karen's website I thought the series was more geared towards young teens, so I really never thought to read this. So once I picked up the book I had a hard time putting the book down the book is about a young boy who doesn't quite feel loved and wants a Daddy. The story at first really broke my heart, but the more I read the book did not disappoint at all, Karen does an amazing job at getting right to the point and to the matter of the heart. Unlike most of Karen's book this one was very short read, I read it very quickly and so enjoyable. All i say is grab some tissues and your favorite drink and find a quite place this book will be worth the read.I was given a copy from netgalley for my honest opinion"}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/864041-brenda", "userReview": "Cute little Christmas story.

Best-selling author Karen Kingsbury takes readers into the hearts of Maggie and Jordan Wright who are finding themselves trying to find a way to get through the death of her husband and Jordan's father due to a sudden heart attack. Jordan is dealing with it much harder as an eight-year-old boy who was loved dearly by his father, but the love Maggie shared with him was simply a business transaction in the marriage. She only had that perfect love once in her life as a young girl searching for answers and finding it on the shores of a lake one summer. Maggie has since resolved to give up on love forever and find a way to move forward in her life as a busy district attorney. But she can see that Jordan needs more time than she can find to give him. His grades are suffering and he has now taken his problems directly to God in a letter. Knowing his mother always has the right answers, Jordan believes that his special prayer for a new daddy must be written out and mailed by his mother. He knows beyond a doubt that God will hear him and answer his prayers. Casey Cummins understands that level of grief that Maggie and Jordan are feeling. He too, lost his wife Amy and his unborn son due to delivery complications. He knew that he would never find a love like that again, but there is still an empty place in his heart for helping others. He learns about Healing Hearts, a program that places grieving children with single adults as a way of helping them through their struggles and that feels like the perfect answer for managing his own grief. Now he prays that God will provide him with just the right child for him and hopes he won't have to wait too long. I received Maggie's Miracle by Karen Kingsbury compliments of Faith Words, a division of Hachette Book Groups for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions here are strictly my own. This is the second book in the Red Glove Series and is bound to ignite a spirit of love and hope in your heart this Christmas season. It is about believing not only in miracles but the power of prayer to restore those broken places in our hearts and find hope once again. There is also a list of activities to inspire you to incorporate them into your Christmas season and give back some hope and love to those that are hurting. I love the idea of reading this book a chapter a day starting at Thanksgiving as a way of encouraging and inspiring us all to be better people. I easily give this one a 5 out of 5 stars. While these are part of a series, they can be read as a stand alone and in any order."}, {"userName": "Loraine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1922494-loraine", "userReview": "This is the third books I have read from Karen Kingsbury's Red Glove Christmas series. Each of them has been memorable. Summary: Megan Wright spent just a week with him the summer of their 14th year. But despite a lifetime of heartache and bad choices, she never let go of young Kade's magical definition of love. After college Megan settled for a relationship of convenience. Now it's been two years since her husband's death and she is a high-powered attorney, looking for help with her lonely young son. Across town, Casey Cummins is still dealing with the three-year-old tragic loss of his wife. His search for meaning and hope leads him to contact the Manhattan Children's Organization, who connect him with a fatherless child. Now life is suddenly taking a series of unusual twists. How could Megan know that the teenage boy from all those years ago actually kept his promise? Or that the miracle she prayed for as a girl is only a breath away? The prayers of her little boy are about to be answered, and in a strange and mysterious way that only heaven in all its glory could've brought aboutI loved the characters in this story especially Maggie's son Jordan. A typical second grader he is full of fun and yet still full of hope. He knows what he is missing in life and believes with all his heart that God will fulfill his dream. This is a delightful Christmas story that warms the heart and shows how miracles can happen in everyday lives. It's a quick read and one you will find you can't put down until you have reached the end."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6147556-nancy", "userReview": "I love the red glove series of books. I make a point of reading them each year during November or December. This book is about an eight year old boy, whose older father had died, and his mother worked too much to pay attention to him. His mother learns of a Healing Heart program for grieving children. At first it's a way for her to give her son attention, so she can work more. Then the mom is brought into the picture. This is a sweet story."}, {"userName": "Christie Brumley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14976838-christie-brumley", "userReview": "Maggie's Miracle is one of those rare treasures that come along when you least expect it in your life.

The book was based around 2003, but also flashbacked to the early to mid 90\u2019s. Manhattan, New York is where the main characters live. Throughout their stories though, the setting changes to Lake Tahoe, California and even all the way to Port-au-Prince, Africa. The characters in this story have very interesting and heart-grabbing backgrounds. Throughout the book, the author did an amazing job of tying their stories together and having a lovely ending to tie it off. The way this book was written, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and never wanted to stop. I would say that my most memorable, favorite part of this book is the relationships made because of how their stories connected and intertwined. This book is so good, 5/5 stars and beyond, I totally recommend this to readers who like stories about relationships, real love, and miracles.

Maggie\u2019s Miracle is a reminder that priorities need to be adjusted and time taken to be a family. It\u2019s about grief and how God is always there.
