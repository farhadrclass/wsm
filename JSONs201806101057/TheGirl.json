Women may despise men, but sometimes they despise each other more in reality, and it takes a rare woman writer to get beyond such angularities to be able to write with sensitivity both about men and women. Meridel le Sueur is such a writer and her work in some strange way takes me back to the work of Anais Nin, my favorite woman writer ever since I read \u201cA Spy in the House of Love\u201d and \u201cHenry & June\u201d, not to mention her \u201cJournals\u201d. But why does Meridel le Sueur remind me of Nin? Because both were \u201cactivists\u201d of a different order from the women who masquerade these days as \u201cactivists\u2019. You could say that their distinguishing mark was \u201csensitivity\u201d and not so much \u201cideology\u201d. Ideologists are rarely sensitive. They become encrusted and fossilised. Then again, writers are usually in poetry in motion, dynamic beings, whereas \u201cactivists\u201d are generally \u201cstuck and scratchy records\u201d.But to get back to the book, aptly and simply titled THE GIRL, it\u2019s central aspect is that it is written in a colloquial vein and it is one of the most poignant books I have ever read. If you want to feel like or identify with or enter the soul of a girl or, better still, a woman, any woman (and, of course, I do not consider the ideologues or activist, feminist women as authentic \u201cwomen\u201d, it seems to me that most of those who belong to that ilk have undergone female circumcision at some point in their life!), the Universal Woman, Eve, Pandora, the Magdalene, Sita (perhaps the oppressed, subservient, helpless Sita more than the princess), Mirabai, Mother Mary, Pandita Ramabai, Kasturba Gandhi, Lady Mountbatten, etc, this book is THE PORTAL.Set in the years of the Depression, in the speakeasies and among prostitutes who had no other choice but to take up sex work, the story of The Girl unravels itself. The innocent is forced to work among bootleggers, down and out of job men looking for a fix or a fuck to drown their helplessness, strike busters, wise women who have been through hell and a variety of men and untoward circumstances and who form both the underbelly and the renaissant underground of society, the fecund solidity of Source, and she comes into her own. She makes love for the first time, then accompanies Clara her prosstitute friend who believes that good times are coming while she takes in four or five men a day to make five bucks, and finally gets drawn into a plot to rob a bank. That\u2019s where poverty leads \u2013 to robbery. Thence, to death, insanity, perennial hunger, disease, torment at the hands of \u201ccharity\u201d and \u201cwelfare\u201d givers, unceasing pain punctuated by human love and nature\u2019s overflow, the organising of the workers into a brotherhood/sisterhood, and the wondering if the exploitation of human beings by human beings will ever come to and end. Tragedy has its own dignity.Poignant. Gut-wracking. Heart-wrenching. The chapter on Clara\u2019s dying, after the authorities take her away for electro-convulsive treatment, made me weep with a book after a long time. Clara, who always in the midst of her suffering, believed that every dark cloud had a silver lining. In her case, the only silver lining was dying with her mouth open in the O of Horror.That is what this book is about. Written fluid, the reader melts. Memorable sentences and dialogues burn every page with a fierce flame. The pace is perfect. The stories are all culled from real life and woven into an arpillera that can not be burnt out from memory. \u201cMemory is all we got, I cried, we got to remember. We got to remember everything.\u201d Memories of the evil that haunts humankind to its suffering and destruction. Let them be inscribed thus, in its mixutre of despair and hope.It takes a woman to write about women, men, society, loyalty, love, brutality, the inevitability of hope when one is on the underside of Fate or Destiny as the case might be. It takes a woman to fertilise writing with her own fecund juices of insight, her ripening eggs of penetrating prescience.Meridel Le Sueur\u2019s ode to the heroic women of the Depression is a book very few would have come across. It ends with a powerful assertion of the feminine roots of life, the feminine impetus to life, the feminine shaping the future despite every obstacle, man-made or society-forged.Here is the last line of the book, when the protaganist has given birth to her own child \u2013 a girl.\u201cO girl, I said down to her, giving her my full breast of milk.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643578-jess", "userReview": "This was a hard one to rate, and I think I rounded up a little. Any book that takes place in Minnesota is instantly endearing to me, I can't help it--we look out for our own and everything. I'm also a big fan of Le Sueur's essays and short fiction (her writing on women on the breadlines, feminization of poverty, and women in socialism is really awesome). This was a good book with a good plot--it wasn't especially literary but I think it was trying to be.There were some really gorgeous scenes, especially between The Girl and Butch before his death in a car after a bank hold-up gone bad (banks certainly aren't seen in a positive light in this one). The Girl's relationships with Clara, Belle, Amelia, and her mother are all refreshing to read in this type of fiction...her life is changed by a man but ultimately, it revolves around other women (also a commentary on socialism and collectivization,). I think any fan of 20's crime/prohibition/gangster fiction would get something out of The Girl.The politics are pretty heavy-handed, which I'm sure is why this book never really took off. Le Sueur is a known communist and a labeled proletarian writer and it shows through her fiction (notably Amelia, who is a pretty decent cardboard cutout of the perfect communist woman). It prevents the novel from transcending anything except a heavy political statement, which is too bad. I know that it has been picked up by feminism, and that is a genuinely valid criticism--but it's mainly a political book, in my opinion."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/300337-matthew", "userReview": "What a downer!"}, {"userName": "Beth Barany", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4470008-beth-barany", "userReview": "My great-grandmother's book is an interesting insight and an emotional ride into a world long gone, yet still close."}, {"userName": "Lenore Pettinger", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8165570-lenore-pettinger", "userReview": "A stark depiction of life during the Depression and what women had to do to survive.

Ms. Le Sueur's prose is powerful and packed... the narrative is quick and jagged like that of a woman confiding in you. There are stand out portions though that bear repeating:\"I felt like a great root sprang up out of my skull green, or a terrible root went in the dark with a hundred mouths looking for food.\"*\"Was she a criminal? Was she a danger? Clara never got any wealth. She died a pauper. She never stole timber or wheat or made poor flour. She never stole anyone's land or took it for high interest on the mortgage. She never got rich on the labor of others. She never fattened off a war. She never made ammunition or guns. She never hurt no one. Who killed Clara? Who will kill us?\"There were so many more moments in the book that made me pause and really enjoy the prose beyond the story - this book stands as a root, as the background to great writers like Ms. Winterson or Ms. Morrison who combine personal drama with really amazing writing."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1439856-david", "userReview": "I was impressed how well the focus stayed on the story in this book. Knowing that this book was considered a feminist and possibly a socialist text, I was afraid that ideology would get in the way of the narrative- like in Sinclair's \"The Jungle.\" Perhaps that was true to a small extent, but this book did not sacrifice story to politics. The humanity of the characters and the brutality of the world in which they found themselves seemed primary, everything else secondary. I was pleased to see that the book was not specifically anti-male. I expected that, having heard it was an important feminist book. I think a lot of men shy away from such books on the worry that it will just be anti-male instead of pro-woman. However, I didn't feel that here. Admittedly most of the men in the book didn't come off so good, but I think that was just the characters and their world. Sure, there were some shitty guys in here, but the book did not seem to need to bitterly attack men in general to make its points about women. Sad as it was, I enjoyed this book very much."}, {"userName": "Petter Nordal", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3785630-petter-nordal", "userReview": "A little mother-feminist heavy-handed, maybe, but a novel of people surviving the Depression is bound to have some politics to point out.
