I trusted you, Mrs. Bunting, and you betrayed me! But I am protected by a higher power, for I still have much to do.\u2019 Then, his voice sinking to a whisper, he hissed out \u2018Your end will be bitter as wormwood and sharp as a two-edged sword. Your feet shall go down to death, and your steps take hold on hell.\u2019\u201d\nMr. and Mrs. Bunting are on the verge of tightening their belts further than they have ever been tightened before when a knock comes at the door. It is a man, nay a gentleman, looking for lodging. It has all the nuances of a higher power providing a timely intervention. He has a pile of gold sovereigns and wants to pay for his lodging a month in advance. His name is Sleuth, but generally he is thought of and referred to by the Buntings as The Lodger. \u201dAs she walked down the stairs, the winter sun, a scarlet ball bringing in the smoky sky, glinted in on Mr. Sleuth\u2019s landlady, and threw blood-red gleams, or so it seemed to her, on to the piece of gold she was holding in her hand.\u201dMr. and Mrs. Bunting are both from domestic service and had retired to purchase this house in London and rent out lodging. When lodgers aren\u2019t appearing as regular as they hoped Mr. Bunting makes himself available as extra help for birthday parties etc. Even those opportunities have been too few to keep them solvent. The Lodger has given them at least temporary respite from the necessity of giving up their dream and going back into domestic service. A lady, well not a gentle lady, but a woman of ill repute has been found slashed to death. Mr. Bunting had been denying himself the newspaper, but with this new windfall he can devour them once again giving him much missed edification and exhilaration bordering on arousal. More women are found dead, horribly disfigured, and the city trembles. These atrocities etch words of fear into every conversation. The Lodger borrows a Bible. He reads this Bible out loud, but he is not reading passages that would offer comfort. His voice rings out with vengeance. \nThe Lodger is...well...strange.He nearly goes into hysterics every time there is a knock at the door. He stays in all day muttering over his Bible and only goes out at night. The fascinating part of the book for me was that Mr. Bunting and Mrs. Bunting each were gathering droplets of information about their lodger that they were afraid to share with the other. They had been so close to disaster they were unwilling to give up the very providence that kept them from the brink of ruination. \u201dShe wondered at her temerity, her--her hypocrisy, and that moment, those few words, marked an epoch in Ellen Bunting\u2019s life. It was the first time she had told a bold and deliberate lie. She was one of those women--there are many, many such--to whom there is a whole world of difference between the suppression of the truth and the utterance of an untruth.\u201dThe press begins to call the killer THE AVENGER.As a mound of circumstantial evidence begins to accumulate in the minds of the Buntings each new revelation makes it more and more clear that their angel of providence might prove to be a devil in disguise. Alfred Hitchcock made a silent film about the The Lodger. It was made in 1927 and I\u2019ve only seen bits of it, but I was struck by the expressions of horror that the director was able to achieve in his actors. \nFour more movies based on Marie Belloc Lowndes\u2019s book were made in 1932, 1944, 1953, and 2009. Lowndes is the sister of the prolific and celebrated writer Hilaire Belloc. Like her brother she also published several books a year. The Lodger is considered her masterpiece and obviously the film industry agrees. I was completely caught up in the events of this book. I felt the stress of not only the circumstances surrounding The Lodger, but also the tug of war being waged in the Buntings\u2019s consciousness between the shame of greed and the specter of returning poverty. Lowndes has a deft hand in how she reveals information. I found myself constantly reevaluating what I knew and was frequently baffled about what I really wanted to have happen. Highly recommended for those who have a desire to read some well written, creepy, Victorian horror.

Surely Lowndes stored up many impressions of that time, and used them to craft this subtle tale that has since been adapted several times to screen.As a modern reader, I have certainly read more suspenseful and gruesome novels, but taken in context with the time period it was written, the effect of Lowndes story can't be underestimated, IMO. It's really unfair to classify this as a true mystery/suspense or horror story, since there is very little of either to sustain those titles. Rather, this story is more of a psychological character study.The first chapter of Lowndes novel presents the reader with a couple living at the edge of an abyss. Robert and Ellen Bunting are middle aged, lower middle class, and broke. They have sold almost everything they own in an attempt to survive, but face almost immediate starvation and homelessness within a few short weeks. Formerly of the servant class, the Buntings are upright, hard-working and decent people down on their luck, and Lowndes' writing makes the reader feel the deprivation and fear that accompanies the Buntings' at this time in their lives. The couple have nothing left except an overwhelming sense of hopelessness.So when a mysterious young man (a \"true gentleman\" in Mrs. Bunting's words) knocks on their door one day seeking lodging, it's like the answer to a prayer. The lodger, Mr. Sleuth, is admittedly strange, but his mound of gold sovereigns and the promise of a huge monthly rental payment (and no more starvation) throws him in a kinder light then he might otherwise have been perceived by a more discerning couple.As the days and weeks go by, Ellen Bunting in particular goes through a series of feelings for her lodger: curiosity, protectiveness, and a slow-simmering fear. Fear because the city of London is experiencing a wave of violent murders the likes of which haven't been seen in recent history. Little by little, Ellen has reason to suspect that her lodger might be more then he appears. After a long time, Robert Bunting begins to sense the same, although each keeps their growing suspicions to themselves. But can their fear of his possible dark deeds override their fear of being penniless, homeless and hopeless again? Do they have a duty to protect the city from further attacks, or is their duty to themselves and their wellbeing? How far will they go to keep from falling back into the abyss? And perhaps most important of all, are their fears and suspicions grounded in truth, or merely the result of an active imagination spurred on by a sensational press?That's the real dark beauty of this novel, and what makes it such an intriguing character study and morality tale."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "The Lodger has long been one of my favorite novels; reading it again a second time proved no less suspenseful than it did the first time through. Marie Belloc Lowndes based her novel very loosely on the story of Jack the Ripper, and the novel is set in London at a time when a series of horrific murders blamed on a person known only as \"The Avenger\" is the big news on the streets. At the same time, the story is not really about these murders; it is actually the story of a husband and wife who find themselves in dire financial straits and who are quite literally pulled back from the edge of starvation and ruin when a gentleman takes a room in their home. Calling himself Mr. Sleuth, the man has strange habits, including walks in London's foggy streets and reading Bible verses about wicked women. But for the Buntings, especially for Mrs. Bunting, the lodger and his money is literally their salvation, and it is because of this that Mrs. Bunting is forced to carry a terrible burden, one that tears her up inside with both guilt and fear. While some readers might be disappointed that the focus of the novel isn't on Jack the Ripper (or his Avenger persona here), I think Lowndes' intent was much more of an intense psychological study of a woman who is caught up in a horrible dilemma that offers her very little choice and leads her to a near breakdown. This may be why some people found it slow going, with very little happening vis a vis the Avenger and the crimes. However, my feeling is that it's possible that the book has often been misread -- to me it is very successful, highly atmospheric and downright claustrophobic. For me, it's a story where the tension and feeling of dread builds slowly as the novel progresses, and when the ending came around, I felt like I could actually breathe again. To me, if a book has that much impact on a reader, it's a damn good one. Highly, highly recommended -- but it's a book best gone into with an open mind and no preconceived notions."}, {"userName": "Dorcas", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21426381-dorcas", "userReview": "A deliciously creepy thriller reminiscent of an old Vincent Price movie. Its the kind of book you read with black and white pictures forming in your mind.

Marie Belloc-Lowndes wrote this work in 1913, after living through the Jack the Ripper phenomenon, and she captures the horror and morbid fascination of Londoners with chilling effect as she recounts the bloody crimes -- and the media sensation -- of \"The Avenger.\" The novel is less about the killer, though, than about Robert and Ellen Bunting, a solid and hardworking lower-middle-class couple who both left service to try for an independent life running a boarding house. At the start of the novel, their entrepreneurial gamble seems to have failed. The middle-aged couple have pawned all they could and tightened their belts, but starvation is staring them in the face. The appearance of a young gentleman who wishes to be their lodger seems to be a godsend.The author traces the complex and sympathetic descent of both Buntings as their self-interest wages war against their consciences -- for, although the lodger is all that stands between them and utter financial ruin, and they feel justly loyal and protective of him, Ellen first and later Robert gain good reason to suspect that the young gentleman is \"The Avenger.\" This is a psychologically rich piece, fraught with internal tension and steeped in a sense of place and time. The changes in the Buntings are believably drawn as the weight of their secrets grows heavy on their shoulders. The ending is both satisfying and, in the long term, quite disturbing.It's no wonder Alfred Hitchcock (who adapted this novel both for radio and film, the first of five filmmakers to do so) found inspiration in this haunting story. I recommend anyone interested in the Gothic, psychological horror, historical mystery, and/or the story of Jack the Ripper."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17629329-leah", "userReview": "A deadly dilemma...Mr and Mrs Bunting are becoming desperate. Having left domestic service to run their own lodging house, they've had a run of bad luck and are now down to their last few shillings with no way to earn more unless they can find a lodger for their empty rooms. So when a gentleman turns up at their door offering to pay a month's rent in advance, they are so relieved they overlook the odd facts that Mr Sleuth has no luggage and asks them not to take up references. He seems a kindly, quiet gentleman, if a little eccentric, and the Buntings are happy to meet his occasionally odd requests. Meantime, London is agog over a series of horrific murders, all of drunken women. The murderer leaves his calling card on the bodies \u2013 a triangular slip of paper pinned to their clothes with the words \u201cThe Avenger\u201d written on it...Well, what a little gem this one turned out to be! Written in 1913, it's clearly inspired by the Jack the Ripper murders but with enough changes to make it an original story in its own right. It's the perspective that makes it so unique \u2013 the Buntings are just an ordinary respectable little family struggling to keep their heads above water, who suddenly find themselves wondering if their lodger could possibly be living a double life as The Avenger. Lowndes does a brilliant job of keeping that question open right up to the end \u2013 I honestly couldn't decide. Like the Buntings, I felt that though his behaviour was deeply suspicious, it was still possible that he was simply what he seemed \u2013 an eccentric but harmless loner. With the constant hysteria being whipped up by the newspapers, were the Buntings (and I) reading things into his perfectly innocent actions? Of course, I won't tell you the answer to that!The book isn't simply a question of whether Mr Sleuth is The Avenger or not, though. What Lowndes does so well is show the dilemma in which Mrs Bunting in particular finds herself. It's not long before she begins to suspect her lodger \u2013 his strange habit of taking occasional nocturnal walks, his reading aloud from the Bible when he's in his room alone, always the passages that are less than complimentary about women, the exceptionally weird and suspicious fact that he's a teetotal vegetarian (I've always been dubious myself about people who don't like bacon sandwiches...), the mysterious bag that he keeps carefully locked away from prying eyes. And then there are the \u201cexperiments\u201d he conducts on the gas stove in his room, usually when he's just come back from one of his little walks...\nMrs Bunting returned to the kitchen. Again she lighted the stove; but she felt unnerved, afraid of she knew not what. As she was cooking the cheese, she tried to concentrate her mind on what she was doing, and on the whole she succeeded. But another part of her mind seemed to be working independently, asking her insistent questions.The place seemed to her alive with alien presences, and once she caught herself listening \u2013 which was absurd, for, of course, she could not hope to hear what Mr Sleuth was doing two, if not three, flights upstairs. She wondered in what the lodger's experiments consisted. It was odd that she had never been able to discover what it was he really did with that big gas-stove. All she knew was that he used a very high degree of heat.\nBut, on the other hand, there's nothing definite to say he's the killer, and Mrs Bunting rather likes him, and feels sorry for him since he seems so vulnerable somehow. And, just as importantly, the Buntings rely totally on the rent he pays. Lowndes starts the book with a description of the extreme worry and stress the Buntings have been under over money, which makes their reluctance to report their suspicions so much more understandable. For what if they go to the police, and it turns out he's innocent? He'll leave, of course, and what will they do then? But what if he's guilty and they do nothing \u2013 does that make them guilty too? It really is brilliantly done \u2013 great characterisation and totally credible psychologically.The other aspect Lowndes looks at is the role of the newspapers in whipping up a panic (perhaps not undeservedly in this instance), printing lurid details of the horrific murders, and giving out little bits of dodgy information as if they are facts. The Buntings have a young friend, Joe, who's on the police force, so they get access to more of the truth, though the police are thoroughly baffled. As the murders mount up, so does the tension, and we see both of the Buntings becoming more and more obsessed with reading every detail of the case, desperately hoping for something that will prove their suspicions wrong.The story is dark and sinisterly creepy but the gore is all left to the imagination, and the tone is lightened in places by a nice little romance between Joe and Mr Bunting's daughter, Daisy. It's very well written and Lowndes, like so many writers of that era, has made great use of the notorious London fogs to provide cover for dark and dastardly deeds. One where I really did spend the entire time wondering what I would have done, and fearing for the poor Buntings \u2013 no wonder Hitchcock used this as the basis for his first big success back in the silent movie era. But will the movie live up to the book?

She manages to accomplish by not telling all, and letting the reader make their own conclusions about several key plot elements. Lowndes uses a slowly evolving, subtle mystery with clues along the way. With a Jack the Ripper-like killer on the loose, confusing and befuddling the authorities and leaving cryptic messages near the victims, an uneasy feeling resides in London. In The Lodger, the atmosphere is established from the get go\u2014with a murderer on the loose, is it safe to go out at night? Can the authorities outwit him? There are many elements that add to the dimension of suspense: foggy and bleak London, a mysterious lodger who resides with the Buntings, a tense inquest, a visit to the Museum of Horrors. At the center of the novel are the Buntings, a couple who, down on their luck, decide to let a room to a rather eccentric and odd lodger, Mr. Sleuth. We see the story from mostly the Buntings point of view, and as more fall victim in London, there is a sense that this killer named The Avenger is too smart for all. Mr. Bunting has a sort of morbid fascination with the case, and one of the men who is part of the investigation, Mr. Chandler, stops by to give Mr. Bunting updates on their findings. Bunting\u2019s daughter, Daisy, comes to visit and also has an interest in the case as well. On the other side is Mrs. Bunting, who internalizes her shocking thoughts about who the killer may be.

Or technically Ripperesque as the case may be here. The Lodger is considered something of a classic and I'm sure I've seen a film adaptation at some point, seemed like a book worth a read. And so it was, I didn't love it, but it was interesting. Sort of like a dated Ruth Rendell story style wise set during a reign of a homicidal Ripperlike (though more prolific) maniac in London with a married couple of former servants taking in a lodger due to their impecunious circumstances and then slowly getting clued in that maybe the quiet gentleman upstairs isn't quite what he seems. Despite the lack of likeable characters, the suspense was well maintained, with Mrs. Bunting's fascination with her charge turning from servitudish/maternal/protective to something more appropriately akin to fear being the main motif and the main reader's perspective on the entire claustrophobic nightmare. For fans of psychological horror this is certainly worth the three hours of effort. For a 103 year old story it holds up quite decently, because, after all, how well can a person really claim to know another, plus it's a potent cautionary tale on stranger dangers and, in this day and age of ride/house/etc. shares, inviting someone into your space.

The novel is mystery and psychological thriller, written by Marie Belloc and the story is turned into Hitchcock directed silent film \"The Lodger\". Since I liked Hitchcock movies, I bought this kindle edition. The story is Mr.Bunting and his wife Ellen have a lodge and they are in a desperate need of money to survive. The arrival of Mr.Sleuth as a lodger first appears to be a blessing for the Buntings but later it turns out to be a curse because series of murders occur as intoxicated women are killed by a lanky man carrying a brown bag. The description of the murderer makes Mrs.Bunting to consider that the lodger should be the serial killer. As the days roll by, Mr.Bunting also comes to the conclusion that their eccentric lodger is the murderer. Is their opinion right? Or the arrival of Mr.Sleuth and murders are just a coincidence?A superb psychological thriller the author narration conveys our own thoughts, especially Mrs.Bunting, a woman who is very clear headed and having a good memory. There are less number of characters in the novel, recurring characters are Mrs.Bunting, the Lodger, Mr.Bunting, Joe Chandler (attached to the detective section of the Metropolitan Police) and Daisy, daughter of Mr.Bunting. Apart from the main story each character have their own problems and conflicts. Of all these characters the Lodger and Mrs. Bunting captured my attention. At the end I felt pity for them, the sleep deprived Mrs.Buntings, her contemplation, her inability to share her thoughts are worth mentioning, the highlight is that her attentive observation on her lodger from his sneaking out from his room in mid night and return. The author has used a powerful statement to show how pathetic her condition is, \"She lay thinking and listening \u2013listening and thinking\". I liked to quote one line from the novel:\"Any ordeal is far less terrifying far easier to meet with courage, when it is repeated, that is even a milder experience which is entirely novel\".Highly recommended for those who like mystery thrillers.

So.In theory, this is a story I should have liked -- after all, it's a take on Jack the Ripper, a tale of \"How would you react if you found out you were lodging a serial killer in your house?\" -- but instead I ended up hating it. All of the characters of consequence (of which there are only three [Mr. and Mrs. Bunting, and Mr. Sleuth] as the landlord's daughter, Daisy, and her policeman suitor could be removed from the book without effect) are boring, kinda-neurotic serial killers at their best, and damned-irritating and flabbergastingly HORRIBLE HUMAN BEINGS at their worst. In particular, Mrs. Bunting, she who defers to her husband in all things except whether or not they should continue to host a suspected serial killer in their lodgings, has become one of my least favorite characters of all time. I was half-convinced that she would have run off with Mr. Sleuth due to some form of Stockholm syndrome by the end of the novel.\"But wait!\" you say.You: Mrs. Bunting didn't turn in Mr. Sleuth because he was the only thing standing between them and the poor house!

LOTS of money, actually.You: But Mrs. Bunting was afraid that the police would accuse her of being an accessory to murder!Me: Ah, but since this story is supposed to reflect the general mindset of the public and police when the actual Ripper murders were occurring -- I think she could have gotten the police to pardon her and Mr. Bunting. She's a pretty clever lady, after all. Heck, she could have turned him in, and then turned her upstairs apartment into a museum and made loads of half-pennies that way. \"Behold! The \"ink\" stain on the carpet! The dresser with the locked drawer! The concordance and Bible!\"You: But--but she likes Mr. Sleuth, even though he's a bit weird. He's a gentleman. She even says he's a gentleman about a million billion times!Me: And yet she also fears for her life whenever she's alone with him. And she thinks it's a little creepy that he reads aloud all those passages about evil women in the Bible. And she's thinks it's a LOT creepy when he uses her kitchen stove to burn unknown... things. And she also makes Daisy sleep downstairs with her instead of upstairs near Mr. Sleuth. That, to me, says she doesn't really like him -- just the gold sovereigns he has in his rooms.You: But -- didn't you like how the London fog was almost a character by itself?Me: Yeah -- but a pea-souper fog does not a good story make.In general, I was just really frustrated with this story, but it seems that my frustrations are my own because they weren't shared by anyone in my library book group (who all loved the book, or at least said they did). Between the characters I hated and the suspense that I didn't find that suspenseful, The Lodger was not for me. I'll stick with Arthur Conan Doyle and Lyndsay Faye's Dust and Shadow if I'm looking for atmospheric Victorian suspense novels."}, {"userName": "Mariah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1471316-mariah", "userReview": "I cannot believe how long it took me to read this. Really, it had nothing to do with the book and everything to do with other things occupying my attention. I have an unhealthy fascination with true crime. I could watch Investigation Discovery 24/7 much to the dismay of my roommate - then again, she could watch Grey's Anatomy and Ugly Betty 24/7 with a healthy dose of Say Yes To The Dress thrown in there to torment me, so I'd say we're even - so it should come as no surprise that I'd be equally interested in reading what is considered to be the first true crime novel. Written by a woman, no less. I'm not a feminist in the strictest sense, but I love the fact that The Lodger was written by a woman. Considering the times Ms. Lowndes lived in, I find it wonderful that she was able to get this novel published. The Lodger is a very obvious homage to the most notorious unsolved serial killer in London at the time - Jack the Ripper. Told mostly through the third person perspective of Mrs. Bunting - half of a married couple on the brink of financial disaster - The Lodger tells the story of The Avenger. A madman stalking the streets of London at night and savagely killing immoral women, specifically those who enjoy a little too much alcohol. From the beginning, Ms. Lowndes leads the reader to suspect Mr. Sleuth, Mrs. Bunting's lodger who's serendipitous arrival saves the Bunting household from financial ruin, of being the perpetrator of The Avenger crimes. The point of the story is less who-dun-it and more psychological rollercoaster as we take the journey with Mrs. Bunting from mild suspicion to outright certainty that her savior is actually a psychotic killer. By the time the ending arrives - a marvelously open-ended conclusion - Mrs. Bunting is on the brink of complete emotional and physical breakdown. Questions go unanswered in The Lodger: where did Mr. Sleuth get his money? What were his motivations? What experiments was he conducting in the second room he was renting from the Buntings? Still, I was not left unsatisfied. Perhaps it was from reading the entire book knowing Mr. Sleuth was the killer or perhaps it was my desire for Mrs. Bunting to get some relief from her emotional torment, but when Mr. Sleuth finally disappeared into the busy streets of London, I was simply glad to see him go. Mrs. Bunting wasn't the most likable character I'd ever read, but she was a good person and Ms. Lowndes did a marvelous job of making me understand her desperation and fear from the very first page. From a technical standpoint, The Lodger did not feel as dated as I expected. I found it a very easy read, not bogged down by descriptions of the scenery or daily life as some pre-television/movie classics can be. Ms. Lowndes's pacing was also excellent, in my opinion, and she did not drag her story out unnecessarily. What's really commendable, though, is her characterization and using some truly horrific crimes as a framework for a psychological horror story."}, {"userName": "Arwen56", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9615245-arwen56", "userReview": "In un certo senso, mi spiace dover attribuire una sola stelletta a questo romanzo, che non \u00e8 cos\u00ec deprecabile come il sistema di giudizio per riduttivi simboli potrebbe far sembrare. Alcuni spunti brillanti ci sono in questa vicenda in cui \u201cJack the Ripper\u201d ci viene sostanzialmente riproposto come \u201cil Vendicatore\u201d, nonch\u00e8 alloggiato presso una coppia di non pi\u00f9 giovanissimi e rispettabili coniugi, che, dopo molti anni passati al servizio di altrettanto rispettabili datori di lavoro, decidono di tentare la sorte e avviare una piccola attivit\u00e0 di affittacamere, che si riveler\u00e0 disastrosa al punto da condurli sull\u2019orlo dell\u2019indigenza.Un antico adagio recita che quando si sta per annegare, ci si aggrappa anche ai rasoi ed \u00e8 proprio questo dramma che si trovano ad affrontare Ellen e Robert Bunting, i protagonisti di questa storia. Sospettano, senza averne la certezza, di ospitare un assassino (che sia \u201cJack lo Squartatore\u201d o un altro analogo personaggio non \u00e8 rilevante ai fini della narrazione), tuttavia il denaro che lui paga per la pigione marca la differenza tra la fame e una vita modesta, ma per lo meno decorosa. Purtroppo l\u2019autrice non \u00e8 stata in grado di sviluppare in modo convincente le premesse che ella stessa aveva proposto al lettore. Resta dunque, alla fin fine, solo un racconto a tinte fosche che si esaurisce in se stesso, senza nulla offrire a chi non sia amante del genere, nonostante citi Louis Stevenson e uno dei suoi romanzi pi\u00f9 famosi, \u201cLo strano caso del Dr. Jekyll e di Mr. Hyde\u201d."}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2251935-monica", "userReview": "Simply brilliant novel of increasing dark suspiscions regarding the man who is renting rooms from poverty-stricken Mr. & Mrs. Bunting in London in the late 19th century. A Jack-the-Ripper type of serial murderer is active and at large. The Buntings seperately begin to believe that their lodger--whose rent money is saving them from complete ruin--may be the murderer.Lowndes builds these suspiscions without ever once spelling out their fears, leaving the reader also to wonder if he's guilty or innocent. Just a masterpiece of subtle writing. No wonder it's a classic of crime fiction.This was an audiobook, perfectly performed by Lorna Raver, an American who handles the various British accents admirably, but mostly keeps readers involved in the story every moment.

Though inspired by Jack the Ripper, it's not really a nail-biting suspense story. It is more of a tale of moral dilemma when one of the main characters suspects that a series of unsolved murders may have been committed by her strange and eccentric lodger. At the end of the novel, many questions are left unanswered as the solution appears rather suddenly and somewhat unbelievably.
