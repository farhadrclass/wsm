To the men who wrote about the game, it was a talisman, a touchstone, a symbol of the limitless potential of the human individual. That an Italian immigrant, a fisherman's son, could catch fly balls the way Keats wrote poetry or Beethoven wrote sonatas was more than just a popular marvel. It was proof positive that democracy was real. On the baseball diamond, if nowhere else, America was truly a classless society. DiMaggio's grace embodied the democracy of our dreams.\u201d \nJoltin\u2019 Joe DiMaggioJoe DiMaggio was 6\u20192\u201d, a big man, but a man graced with natural elegance. Off the field he dressed well, reinforcing that image of cool, calm, and collected. As one of his dates was surprised to discover she was not the focus of the male attention in the room. \u201dDining with Joe DiMaggio, Ms. Cosgrove felt, gave her a remarkable insight into the male animal. The entire restaurant came to a halt for two hours. The chair of every man was angled so that its occupant could keep an eye on her date.\u201dIt was a nation wide man crush before we knew what to call it.On the other side of the coin was Ted Williams. As much as the press loved Joe DiMaggio they hated Ted Williams. The feeling was mutual. DiMaggio was the best player of his era, but no one would question who was the best hitter. Williams was the first to really look at hitting as a science. \u201dNothing was left to chance. If he was batting and a cloud passed over, he would step out of the batter\u2019s box and fidget until the light was just a little better. He honed his bats at night, working a bone against them to make the fibers harder. He was the first to combine olive oil and rosin in order to get a better grip on the bat. He learned to gradually decrease the weight of his bats as the summer wore on and fatigue set in.\u201d\nTed WilliamsTed Williams was a throwback to another era. \u201dAs he aged he became even more handsome, his face now leathery. he was crusty, outspoken, and unbending, a frontier man in the modern age, the real John Wayne. \u2018He is not a man for this age,\u2019 his old friend and teammate Birdie Tebbetts said of him. \u2018The only place I would put him, the only place he\u2019d be at home, is the Alamo.\u2019\u201dDiMaggio was the Yankee Clipper and Williams was a Boston Red Sox. In the summer of 1949 those two teams were squaring off to see who would go to the World Series. To make things even more interesting Joe\u2019s little brother Dom played for the Red Sox. His whole career was spent in the shadow of his brother, but he was one hell of a player in his own right. The Red Sox got down early in the season, at one point by eleven games, but then clawed their way back into the race. Hollywood couldn\u2019t have drawn up the ending any better. The Yankees and Red Soxs met in a final series at the very end of the season to determine who was going to win the pennantIt was very simple\u2026win or go home.David Halberstam gives us an inside look, not only at the stars, but each significant player involved in this rivalry in 1949. Most of the players came from very humble origins. They all dealt with the stresses of the game different. Ellis Kinder, the great Red Sox pitcher was probably my favorite to read about. The night before he was supposed to pitch he\u2019d stay up all night drinking and chasing women. He\u2019d pour coffee into himself on game day to get ready to pitch. It is amazing to me that he could abuse himself that much and still be one of the premier pitchers in the league. He wasn\u2019t alone, other players as well partied on their off hours as hard as they played on the field. \nEllis KinderYogi Berra was the first ball player to get an agent. A man by the name of Frank Scott noticed that Yogi was being paid in watches instead of money whenever he would give speeches or attend events. Scott saw an opportunity for Yogi to make a lot more money and for Frank Scott to be paid for making the arrangements. The dealings between management and players was also beginning to change. The owners took advantage of the players to the point that it made a Union not only viable, but necessary. It made Tommy Henrich, who spent his whole career with the Yankees, uneasy watching this transition. Certainly some of the charm of the game was lost when players went from being blue collar workers to being millionaires. \nI feel very fortunate to own this baseball card of Yogi Berra. It was one of my Dad\u2019s.This is also the era when owners were struggling with the allure of radio and television. There was fear that it would significantly reduce stadium attendance. Little did the owners know the revenue that would be eventually generated from, especially, television contracts. I\u2019ve been a long suffering Kansas City Royals fan, but last season ended the long playoff drought that had extended back to 1985. The 2014 season was so exciting it was almost worth the wait. I didn\u2019t see these young ball players as millionaires, maybe because they didn\u2019t act like millionaires. They played like kids with exuberance and joy that was contagious to the crowds in the ballparks and the viewers on television. The way they played, referred to as small ball, was like seeing baseball as it was played many decades ago. From the days when players used to run out every play at first; or they would steal without giving a thought to the cost to their bodies; or lay out for spectacular catches in the outfield. These young men from the Royals played last season seemingly unaware of the stats sheet. It was all about sacrifice, hard work, and driving other teams crazy. I have been seeing more spectacular plays this year than I ever remember seeing before and not just from the Royals. It was as if the Royals woke the whole league up and reminded everyone of when a baseball game was as magical as anything Walt Disney ever dreamed up. \nEric Hosmer the talented very young first baseman for the Kansas City Royals.

It had been gone a long time. I loved it as a kid. I played it, I watched it, I had no idea how lucky I was (growing up in Minnesota) to watch the Twins win two Series in a five-year period. Baseball was the only way I connected with my dad. We never did talk \u2013 and still seldom do \u2013 but we sure could pass the hours shagging flies. (There is a specific reason guys love Field of Dreams: because it is spot-on about fathers and sons). As I grew older, I drifted away from the game. I went through a long affair with basketball (which included purchasing Jump Soles in a forlorn attempt to dunk). I flirted with hockey and quadrennial international soccer events. Ultimately, as an adult, I settled on NFL football. Football just pops on an HD television, and with limited minutes in the day, it is relatively easy to follow one team (the Vikes!) for one game a week. (Of course, if my wife lets me, I will spend all of Sunday, plus Monday and Thursday night, watching a half dozen meaningless games). But this summer, baseball started to appeal to me again. I think it had something to do with approaching my mid-thirties, having a second child, and getting the overwhelming sensation that things \u2013 that life \u2013 was speeding out of control. Drinking helped. It always does. But I needed something more. Baseball is the immortal game. It mimics the rhythms of life, but never ends. It\u2019s a sport with a history that predates the Civil War. It is played without a clock, which gives you no choice but to run out the string. Baseball allows things to unfold gradually. This timelessness calmed me. When I felt my anxiety start to rise, I\u2019d flip through the channels until I found the Kansas City Royals playing the Chicago White Sox on Fox Sports Midwest. You want to know something that\u2019s stress free? Royals v. White Sox on a June afternoon. In this newfound spirit, this sudden rejuvenation of love for the national pastime, I went in search of a good baseball book. Why? Because I needed something to read during midsummer tilts between AL Central bottom feeders. Because despite all the great things about baseball \u2013 the complex history; the mythic heroes; the traditions; the beer-swilling \u2013 the games also tend to be a bit boring at times. A short, non-scientific survey of various internet lists of best-baseball-books quickly brought me to David Halberstam\u2019s Summer of \u201949. It was exactly what I was looking for, which was a bit peculiar, since I\u2019d been looking for something quite specific. That specific things, in so many words, was heaping doses of nostalgia. Summer of \u201849 has nostalgia in spades. If it was a color, it\u2019d be sepia toned. In broad strokes, Summer of \u201849 is concerned with the 1949 pennant race between Joe DiMaggio\u2019s New York Yankees and Ted Williams\u2019 Boston Red Sox. Spoiler Alert for time-travelers from 1948: The battle came down to a final game in which the Yankees beat the then-hapless-now-insufferable Red Sox to go to the World Series. The Yanks then handled the Brooklyn Dodgers in the World Series. Really, though, Halberstam\u2019s book is more a collection of mostly-garrulous anecdotes hung from the through-line of the season. Early on, he establishes a pattern that he follows throughout. Begin with talk of the season, describe a game or a stretch of games, and then segue into mini biographies of the various players, from the legendary, the known, and the now semi-forgotten. There is, of course, Joltin\u2019 Joe:Joe DiMaggio was the most famous athlete in America. In fact, he seemed to stand above all other celebrities. Soon after he retired as a player, he returned with a group of friends to the Stadium to watch a prize fight. He was with Edward Bennett Williams, the famed trial lawyer, Toots Shor, the saloon-keeper, Averell Harriman, the politician-diplomat, and Ernest Hemingway\u2026Suddenly, an immense mob gathered. Hundreds of kids, a giant crowd within the crowd, descended on DiMaggio demanding autographs. One kid took a look at Hemingway, whose distinctive face had graced countless magazine covers. \u201cHey,\u201d the kid said, \u201cyou\u2019re somebody too, right?\u201d Hemingway said without a pause, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m his doctor.\u201d For even Hemingway, then at the height of his fame, could not compete with DiMaggio\u2026His deeds remain like a beacon to those who saw him play. More than thirty years after DiMaggio retired, Stephen Jay Gould of Harvard, one of the most distinguished anthropologists in the United States, was still fascinated by him. He had seen him play in 1949, when Gould was seven. Opening Day, he wrote\u2026is not merely a day of annual renewal, \u201cit evokes the bittersweet passage of our own lives \u2013 as I take my son to the game and remember when I held my father\u2019s hand and wondered whether DiMag would hit .350 that year\u2026\u201dThere are also less-remembered players, like the Yankees Jerry Coleman: Jerry Coleman, a young second baseman, was a rookie that spring, and he lived in constant terror. He had been a marine dive-bomber pilot in World War II, flying fifty-seven missions in fighters in the Solomon Islands. But spring training was harder on his nerves. He was both married and broke. He and his wife, Louise, were desperately short of money. They had driven to Florida in the flashy yellow Buick convertible of Clarence Marshall, a teammate who was just as broke as Coleman. Coleman carried in his pocket a cashier\u2019s check for three hundred dollars, which represented his entire savings from his winter job selling clothes in San Francisco\u2026The hook, here, is that the pennant race of 1949 was a classic. Maybe so (I\u2019m a non-purist in the sense that I think the Wild Card system has really goosed late-summer and early autumn baseball), but Halberstam didn't do much to convince me of this belief. Even if you don\u2019t know the outcome, Halberstam\u2019s digressionary style and lazy, yarn-spinning approach doesn\u2019t do anything to build tension. (I didn't know the outcome going in, but I assumed that the Red Sox would lose. They always used to lose, and their fans were obnoxious and self-pitying. Now they always win, and their fans are obnoxious and self-glorifying). Halberstam is a fine \u2013 and well-regarded \u2013 sportswriter. And there is a particular beauty in the way a good sportswriter can take game action, which happens in an instant, and break it down into incremental poetry. Still, Summer of \u201849 is mostly content to bask in the glories of the old ball game, a gauzy look (lit like The Natural) at a time when first pitch took place in the afternoon, when you listened to events on the radio, and when ballplayers were regular Joes taking the train between cities. It is a soothing vision. Of course, being the high-strung, supremely anxious, mind-racing person I am, I couldn\u2019t help but read between the lines. There are a lot of darker undercurrents beneath the halcyon surface. The struggle between labor verses management (we are so used to the \u201coverpaid\u201d professional athlete today, that we tend to forget how badly ballclub owners used to screw their employees). The difficult process of integration, and the racial tensions as black men made their way into lineups. Halberstam pays call to these topics \u2013 he is too good a writer not to \u2013 but he is mostly here to continue the myth (there are no endnotes, and so, so many of the stories related here seem too good to be true). And really, that\u2019s fine. There is a place for the hard, honest truth, and there is a place for the legend. Here, the legend wins out every time."}, {"userName": "Ted", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7213075-ted", "userReview": "4 1/2This is a MAJOR LEAGUE book in my baseball library.Availability. IN PRINTType. PLAYERS/ERAUse. READ _explanation_The author of this book, David Halberstam (1934-2007), was a well-known journalist and writer. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1964 for his Vietnam reporting for the New York Times. The Summer of \u201849 is about the American League pennant race of that year between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. Although the author researched the book in usual ways, his main research consisted of interviewing scores of people mentioned in the book. The interviewees (not all \u201cguys\u201d) are listed in the Acknowledgements, in the following categories: Boston players (19), New York players (22, Berra not included!); Players from other teams (9), Executives, reporters, announcers, and publicists (30), and Others (24).Introductory chaptersIn Halberstam's Prologue, he describes the 1948 AL pennant chase. According to Bill James this was the third best pennant race of the 1940s. (He lists the \u201949 AL race as number 6.) In \u201948, with one week to go in the season, three teams were tied with identical 91-56 records: the Yankees, the Red Sox, and the Cleveland Indians. At the end, a one-game playoff was needed between Boston and Cleveland, which the Indians won.After the Prologue, the first three chapters (untitled, like all in the book) form a long introduction to the main story. Halberstam writes about the baseball of the 1940s, particularly the differences between the prewar, war, and post-war years, and sets the stage for the renewal of the Boston/Yankee rivalry in 1949. A lot of time is spent introducing the two main players: Boston\u2019s Ted Williams, the Yankee\u2019s Joe DiMaggio. We\u2019re told of the contrasting levels of confidence between the Boston and New York teams as they arrived for spring training that year. The Red Sox felt confident, knowing they\u2019d beaten New York the previous season, and had just missed out playing in the World Series. The Yankees, on the other hand, were facing unknowns. A new manager, Casey Stengel, was taking over the team; their catcher, Yogi Berra, was still an unproven commodity, who had yet to gain the confidence of the starting staff; and most critically, their superstar center fielder, DiMaggio, started the season sidelined by a November operation on his feet for bone spurs. The operation had not fixed the problem, and by February the pain had returned. When he was still unable to play in early April, with the season\u2019s start fast approaching, he was flown to Johns Hopkins hospital for an emergency operation. No one had any idea when he might be ready to play, or how well and how often he could play.This was critical for the Yankee\u2019s chances, or at least so thought the pundits. Early in the spring, the experts were figuring the Yankees and Red Sox as equal favorites for the 1949 pennant. But by the time the season started, with DiMaggio now shelved for an undetermined amount of time, a poll of 112 major league sports writers was able to muster only a single vote for the Yankees winning the pennant.These chapters also introduce Halberstam\u2019s narrative style, sort of Shandy-esque. He takes the reader on a meandering voyage, detouring up a sidetrack, wherever his own interest takes him. This sounds disconcerting, but not at all. The author knows what he wants to write about, and knows that this isn\u2019t rocket science, a political narrative, nor a sociological thesis. It\u2019s not Vietnam, it\u2019s baseball, the reliving (for him) of an exciting part of his childhood, and that\u2019s the spirit he writes it in.The SeasonThe next ten chapters tell Halberstam\u2019s wandering story of the season, up to the final series. They follow the course of that summer in a fairly straight chronological order, but much of the material is tale-telling that extends not only back in time but forward (\u201cin later years so and so would always remember \u2026\u201d). Every few pages, there may be a vague reference to a date, or a comment about the standings. So I'll summarize that aspect of the story right now in my own words.\nThe Course of the CampaignIn the early weeks of the season the Red Sox had started slowly, while the Yankees, despite the absence of DiMaggio, got off to a good start. On June 1 they had a 4 \u00bd game lead on the second place Boston team. But by July 4, the Sox had dropped to fifth, 12 games behind the Yanks. Then Boston began to chip into the lead.Ted Williams had been adamant with his teammates that this would happen, that they couldn\u2019t give up. Williams noticed the Yankee pitchers were beginning to struggle a bit, as the heat of the summer wore on. Boston was a hitter\u2019s team, not a pitcher\u2019s team, and July and August belonged to the hitters. Playing constantly in hot, muggy weather became a test of the mind over an unwilling, sluggish body. Sometimes on those suffocating days Williams would feel worn down\u2026 Then he would look at the opposing pitcher. It is hard on me, he thought, but he\u2019s the one really paying for it. The heat, he knew, would disappear for him in the sheer pleasure of baseball.\nBy August 1 Boston had regained 3rd place, 6 \u00bd back. On Tuesday, August 8th, the Yankees opened a three game series in Boston, still ahead by 6 \u00bd. The Sox took two out of three, and though still in third behind the Indians, were now 5 \u00bd back. (From this point in the season Boston was to go 37-14 over their final 47 games.)On September 1 the Red Sox were in 2nd, 3 games behind. I\u2019ll leave it there for now.AnecdotesAny self-respecting baseball book would be remiss without a stock of anecdotes, about the teams, players, managers, umpires, - whatever the author talks about. Halberstam\u2019s book is no exception, and he strikes a fine balance between the occasional (usually amusing) anecdote and simply too many. I\u2019ll just summarize briefly a few of the anecdotes I enjoyed, then give a longer account of one.Joe Trimble, of the New York Daily News, was a constant critic of a part time Yankee, Nick Etten. \u201cOne time Etten left his glove near first base during an inning [this was often done in those days] and a foul ball rolled into it. Trimble wrote that \u2018Etten\u2019s glove fields better without Etten in it.\u2019 \u201cYogi Berra, when introduced to the \u201cimportant writer\u201d Ernest Hemingway, is said to have remarked, \u201cGood to meet you. A writer, huh. What paper you with, Ernie?\u201dTed Williams used to say that when he was to face a really tough pitcher, he might think about him for 24 hours before the game. But for Bob Feller, \u201cI\u2019d think about him for three days.\u201dPhil Rizzuto\u2019s teammates know that he was afraid of almost anything that moved. Gags played on Rizzuto included putting a snake in a gift-wrapped package addressed to him; filling his bunk on the train with live crabs; tying a live bird inside a drawer where he puts his valuables while dressing for the game. One gag involved stuffing the glove he had left on the field during a rain delay with thirty night-crawlers. When he put it on, \u201cIt was like someone had given him an electric shock. He threw the glove high into the air and did what looked like an Indian war dance. Both teams were incapacitated with laughter.\u201d Those were the days, right?Finally, here\u2019s another about Ted Williams. Once Hal Newhouser, with two strikes on Williamscame in sidearm with a cheap curve for strike three. Williams was enraged. Newhouser was a great power pitcher, but Williams felt that this time he had struck him out by cheating. It was a matter of pride, as if he had ruined a no-hitter of Newhouser\u2019s by bunting. \u201cA dinky nickel curve,\u201d he said coming back to the bench. \u201cI\u2019ll bet any son of a bitch on this bench I hit one off him today.\u201d It was a bet that no one cared to take. Inevitably, his next time up, he hit a home run.\nBy the way. Though there are many anecdotes about Williams in the book, there are few about DiMaggio. Why? I would guess it\u2019s because DiMaggio said so little that there wasn\u2019t much to work with. In fact one gets the impression that the few that Halberstam mentions are worthy of telling not so much because of what Joe said, but just as much because he said anything.And this brings us to \u2026b>The main playersJoe DiMaggio and Ted Williams. Destined to be locked together in baseball history by their accomplishments in the 1941 season. Williams (age 22), the last Major League player to bat over .400 for a season; DiMaggio (27) setting the inconceivable record of getting a hit in 56 consecutive games, perhaps the sports record least likely to ever be broken.These two players weave in and out of Halberstam\u2019s story in every chapter. If you don\u2019t want to read anything about either one of them, don\u2019t read this book.I\u2019ll mention here just one comment about each that I found interesting.Halberstam, after telling us about the reticence and actual shyness of DiMaggio, says that this era in baseball, and in America, was very much an advantage to DiMaggio\u2019s legend. It was, he says, DiMaggio\u2019s good fortuneto play in an era when his better qualities, both athletic and personal, were amplified, and his lesser qualities simply did not exist. If he did something magnificent on the field, he was not on Johnny Carson the next night, awkward and unsure of himself, mumbling his answers \u2026 Rather, he had Mel Allen to speak for him. It was the almost perfect combination: his deeds amplified by Mel Allen\u2019s voice.Moving from DiMaggio (and the Yankee broadcaster Mel Allen) to Williams, here\u2019s Halberstam on a remark made by Williams\u2019 friend, the Red Sox sportscaster Curt Gowdy.He was \u2026 the least bigoted man of his time. He could not comprehend judging a player by his color or background. Baseball, he thought, was a universe of its own \u2013 a better one, where talent was the only thing that mattered. Gowdy remembered him as the first person in baseball to predict the coming importance of black athletes in American sports\u2026. His speech at Cooperstown in July 1966, when he was elected to the Hall to Fame, is notable for its generosity to Willie Mays: \u201cThe other day Willie Mays hit his five hundred twenty-second home run. He has gone past me and he\u2019s pushing, and I say to him, \u2018Go get \u2018em, Willie.\u2019 Baseball gives every American boy a chance to excel\u2026 I hope some day Satchell Paige and Josh Gibson will be voted into the Hall of Fame as symbols of the great Negro players who are not here only because they were not given the chance\u2026\u201dPaige \u2013 yes, 1971. Gibson \u2013 yes, 1972.The Season - DenoumentOn Saturday September 24 each team had 8 games remaining.Note: Thanks to the author\u2019s meandering ways, I eventually repaired to the web to get the precise details sorted out. See http://www.baseball-reference.com/tea...This weekend the Yankees played a two-game series at Boston. They came into the series with a 2-game lead. They left town tied, the Red Sox having beat them 3-0 and 4-1.The very next day, Monday 9/26, the teams played again, in Yankee Stadium. I assume this game was probably a make-up for a game rained out earlier in the season. Boston won again, 7-6. The Red Sox had their first lead of the season.Now each team had a three game series against a weaker opponent, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. The Yankees played at home against the Philadelphia Athletics, who were actually 9 games above .500, in fifth place; the Red Sox traveled to Washington for a set against the last-place Senators, who were then 48-101.Each team was able to win, but not sweep, their series. The Red Sox long remembered their loss on Wednesday, when the Senators beat them 2-1 in the bottom of the ninth. This game became known as the \u201cScarborough game\u201d to Rex Sox nation. (The following is an edited version of Halberstam\u2019s text.)Scarborough was a right-handed pitcher, and he was nothing if not smart and crafty. Not only did he give the Boston right-handers a difficult time, but he was poison to Ted Williams. He could decoy Williams better than any other pitcher in the league\u2026 Forty years later Williams paid Scarborough the ultimate accolade: He said that he probably chased more balls out of the strike zone with Ray Scarborough than with any other pitcher in the League.Scarborough was going for his thirteenth victory against only eleven defeats. Not bad for a team with a 48-101 record. He was good that day, giving up only four hits, but the Red Sox hurler, Chuck Stobbs was better, taking a 1-0 lead into the ninth inning. A short leadoff single, then a sacrifice, then an infield hit put runners at the corners with one out. Then another hit went through the infield, between third and short, and the game was tied. Ellis Kinder came in, faced one batter, and gave up a hit to load the bases. Mel Parnell came on to pitch. On his third pitch the Senators tried a squeeze, or a steal of home. Whatever it was, it went awry. Boston\u2019s catcher, Birdie Tebbetts, tagged out the runner at home, officially caught stealing, for the second out, as the runner on second took third. Parnell had the next hitter 1-2, but on his fourth pitch, \u201che simply put too much on it. It might have been a great pitch, but it broke too much. It was low and bounced wide of the plate.\u201d It got by Tebbetts, was ruled a wild pitch, and the game was over. Ted Williams had been held hitless.\nNow, the final weekend. The Red Sox came into Yankee Stadium, two games left, a one-game lead. Still, Boston only had to win one game to wrap up the pennant. But the Yankees felt confident that they could win two. Halberstam draws out his telling of the final series to almost twenty pages, but not me. There\u2019s just too much stuff to choose from, so I\u2019ll cut to this.Saturday The Red Sox pulled out to a 4-0 lead, but the Yankees, with 2 runs in both the fourth and fifth innings, tied it up. Joe Dobson came on to pitch for Boston. New York scored one in the bottom of the eighth off Dobson. Meanwhile the Yankee\u2019s great relief pitcher Joe Page had relieved in the third inning and threw the rest of the game (6.2 innings) giving up only one hit. 5-4 Yanks.Saturday night fans streamed to the Stadium all night long to buy tickets and camp out. The game was close for seven innings. Ellis Kinder started for Boston, gave up a run in the first, but then settled in. His opponent, Vic Raschi, was a little better, and at the end of seven it was 1-0 Yanks. In the top of the eighth Tom Wright had pinch hit for Kinder and walked, but the Sox hadn\u2019t scored. Then in the bottom of the eight Mel Parnell and Tex Hughson gave up four runs between them, the last three on a two-out bases loaded bloop double by Jerry Coleman \u2013 a hit that Coleman felt deeply ashamed of for a long time afterward, thinking it had made him an undeserving hero.The \u201cextra\u201d three runs seemed to make a difference, because the Sox put three on the board against Raschi in the ninth. But that was it. The Yankees had won the pennant, 5-3.Afterwards Kinder was livid at his manager, Joe McCarthy, for pinch hitting for him in the eighth. He was sure he would have kept the game 1-0, and sure that the Sox would have scored (as they did) in the ninth to win it. Well. At any rate, \u201che never forgave Joe McCarthy\u201d. Boo Ferriss, looking at his teammates Pesky and Williams, thought they looked like men who had died in some way. Williams sat immobilized in front of his locker, his head down. He was unreachable. If any reporters approached him, he just waved them away. He later said it was the worst moment in his baseball career, worse than the 1946 World Series defeat, worse than the 1948 playoff defeat.\nIn the World Series the Yankees met the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Dodgers had become a very good team in recent years. In 1949 both teams had finished 97-57.Brooklyn\u2019s team in 1949 featured Gil Hodges, Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, Duke Snider, Carl Furillo, and Roy Campanella, along with pitchers Don Newcombe, Ralph Branca, and Preacher Roe. Wow. Do those names bring back memories to me, even though in 1949 I\u2019d never heard of them.The Yankees countered with Rizzuto, Coleman, Henrich, Berra, Gene Woodling, Bobby Brown, Hank Bauer, and of course DiMaggio, with pitchers Raschi, Allie Reynolds, Tommy Byrne, Eddie Lopat, and Joe Page.Game 1 was one of the greatest pitching duels that had been seen in the World Series. Both starting pitchers went the distance. Allie Reynolds was the winner for the Yanks (playing at home), giving up only two hits. Don Newcombe took the loss for the Dodgers, when he gave up a lead-off homer by Henrich in the bottom of the ninth to lose 1-0. \u201cAllie Reynolds later thought he had pitched as well as he did in his two subsequent no-hitters; and Newcombe, asked to name the best game he ever pitched, cited that World Series game.\u201dThe Dodgers came back in the second game with a 1-0 victory of their own, Preacher Roe beating Vic Raschi. But when the Series moved to Brooklyn, the Yanks gradually asserted their dominance, winning 4-3, 6-4 and 10-6.The Series win was the first for Casey Stengel. And when the Yanks followed it up by winning again in 1950 and 1951, it marked the first time a team had ever won three WS Championships in a row. They made it five in a row by winning again in 1952 and 1953.Post game wrapupWell, there\u2019s many more things I was going to relate about this great book. But space runs short.

With the end of World War II and the advent of television, baseball was poised to become a major part of Americana. Some of the greatest players ever were playing in 1949, among them Boston\u2019s Ted Williams and the New York Yankees\u2019 Joe Dimaggio. Mr. Halberstam begins the book in 1948, a year that featured a three-way battle for the league title between the Yankees, the Red Sox, and the Cleveland Indians. All three teams were knotted with one week to go in the season, and when the dust settled, the Indians and Red Sox were tied and headed for a playoff game. Unfortunately for the Red Sox, they lost the game 8-3 and had to wait until 1949. Understandably, Boston considered 1949 to be \u201ctheir year.\u201dThe rest of the book takes the reader into the baseball season of 1949, covering the pennant race that would essentially be about two teams, Boston and New York. Like a great novelist, the author fleshes out the players that were part of that season, sharing stories and anecdotes. Mr. Halberstam also gives us a fascinating view of baseball and its fans 70 years ago, how America viewed its teams, and the relationship between sports reporters and the teams. Along the way, there are many pieces of information for today's baseball fans, such as the first player to have a representative (whose first job was to have a player paid for speeches in money rather than watches) as well as the backgrounds of many of yesterday\u2019s stars. The book ends with another exciting finish to the regular season and includes the World Series with the National League winner, the Brooklyn Dodgers. Mr. Halberstam then takes the time to tie everything up in a nice package with a what-happened-to-them-later chapter, a fitting end to a great book. This is definitely a gem for baseball fans. Five stars."}, {"userName": "Pris robichaud", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1860127-pris-robichaud", "userReview": "Goddamm, But Playing Baseball Is Fun, 9 Aug 2007 \"Old-time baseball players and fans love to denigrate the modern ballplayer. \"Baseball today is not what it should be,\" one old-timer once wrote. \"The players do not try to learn all the fine points of the game as in the days of old, but simply try to get by. They content themselves if they get a couple of hits every day or play an errorless game... It's positively a shame, and they are getting big money for it, too.\" Bill Joyce, 1916 Ballplayer 'The Golden Age of Baseball' began when players returned from the war until 1958, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants decided to continue their rivalry in California. That time saw many of the most memorable and significant events in the game's history: in 1947, Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier; that same year, the second Yankee Dynasty began with its first of ten pennants and eight championships in a twelve-year span; in 1951, Bobby Thomson hit the \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" to win the pennant for the Giants; in 1954, Willie Mays made his spectacular World Series catch; in 1956, Don Larsen pitched the only perfect game in World Series history. For those of us who are Boston Red Sox or New York Yankee fans, one of the biggest baseball rivalries in history, 'Summer of '49' explains much of the history and romance of these two teams. David Halberstam brings to us the glories, the rivalaries, the drinking, the social and personal stories of the players on both sides. The subject is the pennant race of 1949 between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox which wasn't decided until the last game of the season. Is there really any value to another book telling us what a legend Joe DiMaggio was, or what a great hitter Ted Williams was, or what a great team the Yankees were? Yes,indeedy.1949 was the perfect year, because it marked a turning point in the history of American sport, which is one reason why David Halberstam wrote this book. Baseball was the number one sport, but professional basketball and football were beginning to gain acceptance. Television was just beginning to make its mark. The impact of black ballplayers was only beginning to be felt. David Halberstam brings us the day to day spotliughts of the Red Sox and Yankees for an entire year, from the end of the 1948 season through 1949. During the summer of '49, the two teams had one of the classic pennant races of all time. The Sox struggled at the beginning, while the Yankees, took a commanding early lead. But Boston chipped away at the lead until the final day of the season, when the two teams met to decide the pennant. Sound familiar? David Halberstam reveals the characters and gives us a glimpse of baseball during The Golden Age. He interviewed almost every living member of those teams and several people on the outside--fans, broadcasters, baseball executives, writers, relatives of players--over a hundred in all. The one interview he couldn't get, was from the most important member of the Yankees: Joe DiMaggio. Each team was made up of twenty-five men, plus perhaps ten or twelve others who played a little. We are introduced to every one of them, the drinkers, womanizers, country boys, city boys, the marginal players for whom 1949 will be their only season of glory. We feel a part of the team, traveling with them between games. And at the end of the book, he tells us what has become of them. In the conclusion, David Halberstam tells us how enjoyable it was to write this book, to interview his idols, to do research that many would consider fun. \"I was the envy of my male friends who shared my enthusiasm for baseball in those years. Caught up in the more mundane tasks in journalism or Wall Street or the law, they would gladly have traded jobs with me.\" \"But probably the best reasons for Halberstam to choose 1949 were, first, that it was a terrific, dramatic pennant race between two hated rivals; and, second, perhaps most importantly, as he explains in the author's note, Halberstam was fifteen years old that summer and a devoted Yankee fan. The men he describes in his book were his heroes, and he lived and died with the fortunes of his favorite players.\" David Martinez David Halberstam is gone now. However, his writing will live on, and those of us who loved his writing will remember him well. What Summer of '49 does for me is to renew my love for baseball, and in particular, my love for the Boston Red Sox. Ted Williams, after reluctantly leaving the batting practice cage, once said, \"Goddam, but this is fun. I could do this all day--and they pay me for it.\" Highly Recommended. prisrob 8-05-07"}, {"userName": "Harold Kasselman", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16965781-harold-kasselman", "userReview": "I'm so glad I finally sat down and read this classic; there is no disappointment here. What a fabulous read. It has all a baseball fanatic could ever want. 1949 was a bit before my first MLB ball game interest but this book, written 40 years after the season with the aid of most of the principle players, captures brilliantly one of the best pennant chases in history between two of the greatest rivals of all time: the Yankees and the Red Sox. At a time when baseball and American culture was on the verge of a monumental change because of television, this season was still played out in the imaginations of radio listeners. I laughed out loud at some of the anecdotes about Ellis Kinder, Casey Stengel, Phil Rizzuto, and Yogi Berra. I felt like I got to know some of the greats from an earlier generation that I had seen only for a short time after that glorious season. I loved getting to know Bobby Doerr, Kinder and Allie Reynolds, Joe McCarthy, Eddie Lopat, Vic Raschi,, Dom DiMaggio, and Johnny Pesky. I already knew plenty about Teddy Ballgame(although I did learn how he got that monicker here for the first time)and Joe DiMaggio. I had expected the book to be more cerebral, but Halberstam writes as if he were that 15 year old kid who shared that exuberance he experienced in 1949 with the reader. You feel his love for the game and for the players especially the Yankees. The contrast between the disciplined, stoic, and money driven Yankees and the more laid back fun loving Red Sox is evident. Perhaps as Birdie tebbets opined, the difference between the two great teams may have boiled down to the Yankees having had Joe Page as their great reliever. One item left me sad but not surprised. The only player who refused to meet Halberstam for an interview was Joe DiMaggio. The most graceful of all players apparently couldn't be gracious to one of America's best writers. Maybe there was no money in it for him."}, {"userName": "Nancy Graham", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1427214-nancy-graham", "userReview": "Riveting account of the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry, featuring Hall of Famers Joe Dimaggio and Ted Williams as well as a host of other talented (though often less famous) ballplayers, during a heated race for the pennant and a time of great social change.

Those are wise and banal words. They are also applicable words to Halberstam\u2019s well told novel about the Yankees-Red Sox pennant race in 1949, for if you were to judge this book by its cover you would think that it was a poorly researched cartoon about baseball.Once you get past the odd sight of Joe DiMaggio hitting left handed (with a reversed NY on his uniform) the book tells the tale of mid-century America with a focus on its most popular sport. Halberstam paints a few dozen portraits of assorted players, coaches, front office men, and media members that were influential in New York and Boston baseball at the time. He does a great job of stringing together what is essentially a series of mini-biographies to talk about not just hits, runs, balls, and strikes, but also contract negotiations, the role of the media, the changing feelings about race, class and immigration and a variety of other off-the-field topics. This is a baseball book, but it is not about the nitty-gritty events of a game.Halberstam rightly spends a good amount of time on the teams\u2019 two stars: DiMaggio and Williams. It is not a perfect contrast between the two as they are both image-conscious ballplayers that were all-time great hitters, but what does come into focus as the two are analyzed is how they were treated differently by the media, fans and team mates. DiMaggio was the perfect stoic, a monolith, in some ways as much of an idea as he was a man. Oddly, the death of his father, which happens in the summer of 1949, is barely mentioned. Also, his two marriages don\u2019t make it into the book, not even his famous and tempestuous relationship with Marilyn Monroe. I can only guess this was done out of respect for DiMaggio, but it is an odd and glaring omission. The Williams sections are an honest portrait of a prickly man. Because Williams learned to open up as he grew older, Hallberstam is able to get inside of him more to explain his personality and motivations. After retiring, Williams became a true character who learned to enjoy his life. Every year during spring training, as I prepare for my fantasy baseball draft, I like to read a baseball book to remind me that the game is still about people, events and ideas and not just statistics.

Halberstam also gives fascinating background information on the entire organization, the stands, the announcers, the press, the fans, and the entire world they lived in. The only problem is . . . this book comes with a point of view. And it's not a ballplayer's point of view. It's the point of view of a sleepy, patrician, Anglo-Saxon male of a certain social pedigree, who thinks 1.) that baseball is a great game 2.) that loving baseball makes him a regular guy 3.) that while he is a regular guy he's still a gentleman of the hightest Anglo-Saxon breeding, and entitled to view the rough blue-collar immigrant players with a certain benevolent condescension. Or as Halberstam might put it, in his own inimitable style:\"It was, Halberstam often thought, an extraordinary achievement for a well-born, well-spoken, well-educated journalist like himself to have developed such a profound knowledge of the game. It was a sport, after all, played almost exclusively by roughs, and sub-literates, many of them toothless hillbillies from the back country or oily Dagoes from the big city. It was truly astonishing, Halberstam often thought, that his own brilliance allowed him to see the heroism in these men's lives. They were no more than big simple children off the field. Certainly Halberstam understood why their salaries had be to kept low, to prevent them from getting into trouble. But on the field they played like Greek gods, like immortals who would live forever. It was only fitting, Halberstam thought, that by celebrating their deeds he would become an immortal too.\""}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2467970-mike", "userReview": "Halberstam tells the story of the 1949 American League pennant race between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees. The outcome rested on the final game of the season when these two legendary rivals faced off in Yankee Stadium. The topic has obvious appeal for fans of the game (particularly to those of us with a stake in this rivalry), but Halberstam offers a narrative that can charm the general reader as well. He tells of a bygone era when the crack of the bat was crisp over the radio and many major league players worked off-season jobs. It is nostalgia, however, without naivet\u00e9. Halberstam periodically describes how mid-century baseball also invokes some of the less compelling traits of American society at the time. Unfortunately, this is when he is at his weakest. Halberstam falters only when he strays too far from his narrative of the season. These include not only his too frequent tangents about minor \u201ccharacters\u201d, such as individual sportswriters and a New York tavern owner, that are largely irrelevant to the story, but also his clich\u00e9d attempts at social commentary. The motif of sports as life writ small is a compelling one, but Halberstam is not able to deliver on it and his attempts prove distracting. He is at his best when he sticks to the tale of the season, the games, the players, and the fan reactions. For example, reading the account of the final game (in chapter fourteen) is as close to watching from the seats of Yankee Stadium as is possible. Despite the sixty years that have passed, Yankees and Red Sox fans will find themselves rooting for their teams and following each pitch as if the outcome was still an unsettled issue. Halberstam offers an appreciation of baseball as America\u2019s pastime \u2013 one that is harder to find in an age of television broadcasts, million dollar salaries, and doping scandals. He will leave you asking, in the words of Paul Simon, \u201cWhere have you gone Joe DiMaggio?

I immediately remembered that David Halberstam wrote the best book on Michael Jordan I ever read, and that was sometime in my mid-twenties. I fell in love with his writing then, and this book continued that love affair. It was written in a balanced, back-and-forth description of both teams. Halberstam didn't seem to favor either team, which made for a nice and objective read. The man also seemed well researched beyond just the on the field stats and win-loss records. Like any good novel, Halberstam developed each key player from both teams in a way that made me want to know more about each player and their lives off the field. I was invested in players beyond just Joe and Dom DiMaggio, or just Ted Williams. It was in an era I am so far removed from, that each detail written transported me back in time. Who knew I'd end up caring about Vic Raschi, Charlie Silvera or Eddie Lopat? I was fascinated. At the end, of course baseball fans and historians know that the Yankees won out against the Red Sox and beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in the World Series, of which Halberstam does \"cover.\" That was actually my favorite chapter because of the mention and credit given to an often forgotten Don Newcombe (Newk) and how Jackie Robinson imposed his will on that stacked Yankee squad. Before seeing this book, I admit did not have a high interest in reading about the 1949 Yankees and Red Sox. I'm not from New England or New York, but I love baseball's rich history.

I love the games, the nostalgia, the way the pace of the game matches the rhythms of life. I love streaks and stats and pitch selection. Halberstam argues that baseball is the last great American mythology, and I think he's right. Why else would we still argue that Ruth is the greatest player of all time? Why else would we wonder what it would have been like to watch him bat in a close game? Or to watch DiMaggio go after a ball at the fence? There is a calm about baseball that transcends reality. It's the ultimate escape. As Halberstam details so well in this book, that doesn't mean that baseball is without its real world problems. The conflicts that arose during the breaking of the color barrier, or, the steroid scandal - these point out that baseball does not always handle its problems with grace. But, in the game, there is little reason for the rest of the world to turn - the game is all that matters, and for that reason alone, it breathes value into life. Halberstam has written one of my all-time favorite books. For a person like me, an avid reader who is often entrenched in the \"real-world,\" this book provides what baseball does - a moment of calm and unmitigated enjoyment. Halberstam interviewed dozens of players still living from the 1949 American League pennant race, which is why his descriptions of the games are so vivid, and why he seems to be inside the heads of the players, and provides remarkable access to a legendary season. The prose is clean, and insightful, and poetic. He writes as romantically about baseball as Shakespeare does about love. When the book is over, the escape is over, for a time, until I pick up another baseball book by David Halberstam."}, {"userName": "Dave", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29560882-dave", "userReview": "This is the third book I've read by David Halberstam and I continue to deepen my respect for his talents as an author (also read: 'The Coldest Winter' and 'The Children'). Many very good writers stick to a single genre (biographies, science fiction, mysteries, etc.). Halberstam wrote about a wide variety of subjects (civil rights, war, politics, sports, and more) and did it all at the very highest level. He was a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and a multiple award winning author. I highly recommend any oil his many books.\"Summer of '49\" is about one of the most storied Major League Baseball pennant races in history, between the Boston Red Soxes and the New York Yankees. Baseball was at the peak of its popularity and both teams were brimming with stars and future Hall of Fame players. Halberstam's writing is superb and his love of baseball is obvious. If you are a baseball fan or just love a good story, this one is well worth your time."}, {"userName": "David W Musal", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62078990-david-w-musal", "userReview": "Great reading for any baseball fan!From someone who is primarily a National League fan, I found myself learning just why fans from the northeastern States feel that this IS the greatest rivalry in all of Major League Baseball. Learning about the inside dynamic of each team during that epic pennant race of 1949 made me feel like I was there; even though I was only one year old that summer. Mr. Halberstam's writing is highly detailed, but still easy to read and understand. I have more of his books on my Kindle wish list and I look forward to reading them. I will probably come back to this book and also to his \"October of 64\" book, just to see if I missed anything from either one. I only wish that I had discovered his books earlier in my life for the sheer pleasure of learning what Mr. Halberstam has shared with us.Highly recommended reading for anyone interested in any or all of the subjects he has covered in his career."}, {"userName": "Nick Zaveri", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25887760-nick-zaveri", "userReview": "As always, with a Halberstam book on sports, the book is amazing. I've had this book for years and never got around to reading it. I'm glad I finally did. As he is prone to do, Halberstam tells a great story while providing insightful profiles of all the characters. His profile of Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio are alone the reasons to read this book. Halberstam also provides great analysis of the history of the times (the 1940s) in the form of the relationship between the media and athletes, the development of baseball on the radio and the birth of televised baseball games. The book is both a history lesson and a story of a great moment in sports. This is the third sports book by Halberstam I have read (along w his book on Bill Bellichick and the 1977 Portland Trailblazers). He is one of America's best writers. For baseball fans, this is a must-read. For fans of American history and pop culture this is also a must-read."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/676850-tony", "userReview": "I enjoyed David Halberstam's nostalgic look back at a year in baseball that ended up with some classic games at the end of the season. I have been a long-time Yankee fan but had never read anything on the Yankee's teams of the late 40s and 50s. This book helped me put into context the careers of Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, and other lesser-known Yankees to me, but well-known to fans who lived during this era. I knew even less about the great Red Sox teams of that time. Every spring I read a baseball book, and I thoroughly enjoyed Halberstam's retelling of a classic season. I particular found interesting the times in which he mixed experiences that both he and other fans of that era experienced. The book puts into context not just the baseball world of 1949, and adds layers of understanding to many political and social norms of the time. I recommend this book to baseball fans interested in learning more about the classic year of a Yankee / Red Sox rivalry."}], "description": "With the airwaves saturated with so much sporting choice, it's hard to imagine how, not that long ago, baseball so completely dominated the landscape and captured imaginations. Given the 1949 season that veteran journalist David Halberstam meticulously recreates, maybe it's not so hard after all. It was a season of great public and personal drama for the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees, with the conflict finally resolving itself in a Yankee pennant following a head-to-head showdown on the final day of the season. Each team was led by a star of the highest magnitude: Joe DiMaggio spurred the Yankees despite missing half the season with a foot injury; Ted Williams virtually carried the Sox on his back, missing an unprecedented third Triple Crown by mere decimal points on his batting average. Halberstam focuses much of his narrative on the trials of these two individual sporting giants, adding fine supporting performances by Yogi Berra, Ellis Kinder, Dom DiMaggio, even restaurateur Toots Shoor. Both on and off the field, Halberstam beautifully captures the ethos of a more innocent game that no longer exists, played by heroes far more driven by their pride than by their salaries.", "title": "Summer of '49: The Yankees and the Red Sox in Postwar America", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867863-summer-of-49", "average": 4.07, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1384912701l/18867863.jpg", "reviews": 225, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/42850.David_Halberstam", "name": "David Halberstam"}], "type": ["Sports and Games", "Nonfiction", "Sports", "History"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867863-summer-of-49", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2155631.Summer_of_49", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75411.Summer_of_49", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22798119-summer-of-49", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/944516.Summer_of_49", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1578126.Summer_of_49", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75406.The_Breaks_of_the_Game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/414062.The_Best_and_the_Brightest", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/448135.The_Coldest_Winter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75408.Playing_for_Keeps", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75418.October_1964"]}
