Mahaffey goes all the way and delivers the goods: most authors might be content to reference the urban legend that the AMF \"candlepin\" bowling pin spotter was inspired by fuel rod management technology from the Fermi-1, but Mahaffey is there with patent dates and part numbers. there's a lot of oral nuclear tradition and lore that Mahaffey's preserved in one place, previously unavailable or available only by trawling through the American Nuclear Society's unbearable Nuclear News. if you're a fan of David Lochbaum's \"Fission Stories\" series at All Things Nuclear (and if you're not, then to hell with you), you're gonna be happy.i'm pretty sure mahaffey never reveals any currently classified information (nota bene: i have never held the Q+SigmaX (DoE) or TS+CNWDI (DoD) clearances necessary for weapon design work), which is understandable, but the weapons junkie will still find some gems. the marvelous qualities of 237Np, for instance, had escaped my attention. the discussion of melt-castable explosives is at least at the level of Agrawal's High Energy Materials. sometimes he's teasing (what are these alleged evidences for a neptunium test, Herr Doktor? and alluding to Fermat's Last Theorem when discussing \"secret Japanese uranium-extraction filter materials\" in a footnote doesn't fly. for one, fermat was almost certainly bullshitting or at least wrong. two, we can all go read Seko et al's \"Aquaculture of Uranium in Seawater\". i suspect the good doctor simply lacks confidence regarding amidoxime chemistry), which is annoying. he toes the line regarding initiator design (pretty much entirely classified), though i bet he knows more than he's saying. there's negligible information regarding thermonuclear design, which makes sense given the book's topic.minor nits: the bibliography is good, but i'd have appreciated inline references, and plenty of details are presented for which i can find no listed source (i've confirmed some of them via literature checks, but a good number require simply trusting Dr. Mahaffey). the photographs are uninspiring, either iconic early 20th century shots everyone's seen or Mahaffey's own color shots. i understand not wanting to license photographs, too, but there's frankly way better pictures of nuclear reactors than these (i dug the selfie among the CRTs of Baxley, Georgia's Hatch plant). finally, dr. mahaffey doesn't quite seem to understand youtube URIs, which is more charming than anything--the man has forgotten more science than most of us will ever know, despite our new-fangled YouTubes.finally, mahaffey is quite often funny, and always pleasant to read. not many authors could pack this wealth of technical detail into 420 readable pages. mahaffey deploys garrulous, digressive footnotes with all the abundance and profuseness of david foster wallace, and just as in Infinite Jest they're some of the book's best material. mahaffey writes with verve, and--unlike most technical prose--there are few gross lapses in editing. one gets the idea he'd be a good guy to have a beer with, discussing breeder reactors and why Jimmy Carter was a douchebag and pranks one could play on John McPhee.tl; dr: if you like reading books about controlled fission and its applications, read this. if you don't, you probably won't enjoy it very much. and remember, kids, a day without nuclear fusion is like a day without sunshine!full disclosure: Dr. Mahaffey graduated my alma mater (Georgia Tech), and we both worked at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, though not at the same time."}, {"userName": "Peter Mcloughlin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-mcloughlin", "userReview": "I am a very liberal person. My views are probably far to the left of anyone who has been in the White House. One point of disharmony between myself and my political compatriots is on Nuclear Power. I think the promise of nuclear power is great and I think its critics concerns about safety are overblown. This book is a detailed exploration of the dangers of nuclear power and the ways things can go wrong with it. The public is fearful of radiation contamination and indeed radiation is harmful. The dangers of radiation are quite real but again they are overblown.As with any technology there is the problem of safety and accidents. This book explains almost every major accident and forensically shows where things went wrong. A person reading this book will get a very detailed picture of nuclear power and the variety of ways it is harnessed. This book provides a service to the reader by detailing the specifics of Nuclear Reactor designs, the dangers of radiation and the various safety problems involve one can get a balanced view of the risks and benefits of nuclear power. The author also proposes that light-water reactors have problems that make them sub-optimal and that a liquid sodium reactors would be a safer bet. There is a saying. I would prefer the devil I know to the devil I don't know.

This was particularly evident in the old USSR, where admitting a mistake could cost you (literally) your life. Or your job, and a free trip to Siberia! Lots of gory details, almost all involving experienced people ignoring safety guidelines because.... Well, because.Power density: the current fad for solar & wind goes contrary to the trend since the Industrial Rev began, and is unlikely to continue (he says), once people see the costs. As we already have in Calif, and the Germans, and.... The remarkable density of politicians, and stubornness of the so-called Greens, were mentioned. I will add, 'Against stupidity, the Gods themselves rage in vain.' -- Friedrich von SchillerAlong those lines, we might mention the TX-16/EG-16, a remarkable cryogenic H-bomb built in the mid=1950s. Rated at 11 megatons, it weighed around 82 tons, and would fit (barely) in the bomb bay of a specially modified B-36 \"Peacemaker\". It was the size of a large Airstream trailer. Five were built. Fortunately, no calls for its use were received.And mention should be made of a helpful US govt book, published in 1945 for $1.25: \"Atomic Energy for Military Purposes\". Basically a \"how-to\" primer, many, many orders were received from the USSR. Many helpful photos were added in the 1946 edition. It went through 8 editions and was published in 40 languages. No mention of the careful reasoning behind this unprecedented show of openness, for what hd been a carefully (if ineffectively) guarded military secret. Remarkable.3.5 stars, for as far as I read (266 of 426).

There are caves of death in the Ozark Mountains circa 1880, radium paint that killed dozens, World War II, Three Mile Island, and of course Fukushima Daiichi. Mahaffey leads us through each, carefully explaining isotopes and reactions in ways that neither make you feel stupid nor dumb down the material. He states his biases right in the introduction:The purpose of this book is not to convince you that nuclear power is unsafe beyond reason.... On the contrary, I hope to demonstrate that nuclear power is even safer than transportation by steam and may be one of the key things that will allow life on Earth to keep progressing; but please form your own conclusions.I think he's done a great job of this - I come away from the book thinking that nuclear power has great potential but man, we need to find a way to engineer human stupidity out of it. Whether it's worth the try is left up to the reader.I cannot review this book without mentioning the footnotes - don't skip them! Some are more information or links to videos, and others are tidbits that are awesome but wouldn't fit anywhere else.

So, don't take shortcuts. Seems like a good lesson for life in general.Because of the cover and title, I expected that most of this book would focus on famous power plant incidents such as TMI. However, only two chapters cover accidents at commercial plants. Instead Mahaffey crafted a meticulously researched encyclopedic timeline of accidents from the very early days of bomb research and experimental reactors to Cold War plane crashes involving nuclear weapons all the up to Fukushima. Some of them are more exciting than others and I definitely felt he favored completeness over concision. Nevertheless, his enthusiasm and deep research shines through (just sample some of dry humor in the frequent footnotes), and I really enjoyed this book.I felt like I learned a lot of interesting trivia of U.S. history as well as a better appreciation for how nuclear power plants and bombs work. Mahaffey does a good job characterizing how society has viewed radiation, from the radium girls painting watch dials to movies like China Syndrome (after reading this book you'll know why an out of control power reactor core won't melt through the bottom). He demonstrates how media has sensationalized and misrepresented incidents. By the end, I came to agree with his main thesis that, while dangerous, nuclear power does not deserve its reputation. When done carefully, it is acceptably safe. When I was in middle school I wrote a report on nuclear energy claiming it could be produced safely. My teacher was unconvinced by my paper. If I had only had this book as a source, I think I could've convinced him. Unfortunately, nuclear energy still seems dead in the U.S. for now and the carbon content of our atmosphere is paying the price."}, {"userName": "Conor Cook", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60078066-conor-cook", "userReview": "Could not even finish this book!

That might sound like it's anti-nuclear power, but in fact Mahaffey is a long-time advocate. His major point is that in fact significant accidents are fairly rare, and that with a few notable exceptions, serious casualties are even rarer.His account starts with a bizarre episode in the Ozarks in the late 19th century, with the accidental discovery of what eventually proved to be a radium mine.I will say that the discussion of radium and its various uses, not just for night-glow dials but its medical uses, both science-based and as \"mineral water,\" is by itself worth the price of admission.As he takes us through the development of the bomb, and the first reactors to produce bomb-grade material, and then the development of peaceful nuclear power, there are stories both terrifying and delightful. Initially, everything had to be learned the hard way.The most terrifying detail, to my mind, is that for years the US military tried to develop nuclear-powered military aircraft. Surely they would never crash... Fortunately, that proved to be a technical bridge too far, and the program was cancelled.A recurring theme is that while all of the power-plant and bomb transport accidents involved designs that failed to anticipate a potential technological vulnerability, the power plant accidents only became disasters when one worker or another overrode the automatic controls, often for what seemed like logical reasons. There's also discussion of how politcal and economic factors played into decisions, as well as the inertia of sticking with a known design that's been reliable and effective, even though there may be better designs and paths not followed, that might make nuclear power safer, more reliable, and less unsettling for a concerned public.He does repeatedly hit a favorite theme of mine, the ways in which excessive secrecy to prevent public panic in fact fed public fear that there were dangers they weren't being informed about.All in all, this was an interesting and enjoyable read, or rather in this case enjoyable listen, and Tom Weiner captures exactly the right tone in his reading of it.Highly recommended.I bought this book."}, {"userName": "Teejay", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19139481-teejay", "userReview": "I rarely can consider a non-fiction book as five stars (though many get to 4.5, GR does not allow that classification so I round-down).This is a five-star book. With sincerely-hefty credentials and a vast bibliography of reference material, Mahaffey lays down an absolute page-turner for anyone interested in atomic accidents, failure mode analysis, design analysis, cold-war psychology, and the human proclivity to \"Foxtrot Unicorn\". His command of radiological chemistry is impeccable, and he writes for the scientist as well as the layman. He tells the stories of atomic mishaps - many of them the same as I've read in many other books, but in this case the background and detail is FAR greater than I've ever encountered. He has a muted but very discernible sense of humor throughout (despite the sobering subject matter) that he wields without ever being condescending, making this a quite enjoyable read - and a reference book I'm going to hang onto as a great summation of the decay paths of various isotopes.

I was not interested in the details of just how different kinds of nuclear reactors and such work, and so for large sections, I couldn't concentrate on the descriptions. Since I was listening to an audiobook, I'd just kind of mentally drift until the accident actually happened. I was also really hoping for more descriptions of the aftermaths of the accidents, but Mahaffey usually ended the story once there was no more meltdown happening. I did enjoy the stories of very early radiation accidents and the end stories about Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, but again, it wasn't quite the focus I was looking for. And while I don't mind that Mahaffey is trying to convince the reader that nuclear power is our best resource going forward, I was really bothered that he both somewhat dismissed the problems at Fukushima Dai-ichi as ultimately unavoidable because no design can prepare for all possible events and yet predicted there would never again be such a severe accident in the future. I also thought he was rather cavalier about people's fears of radiation contamination. I too reminded myself about the radiation exposure that comes with eating one banana a day when I lived less than 100 km north of Fukushima, but I also saw what happened to the produce grown to Fukushima's south, and I wouldn't suggest anyone eat them to make any kind of point about our society's inflated concerns."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul", "userReview": "This is a solid set of anecdotes about atomic accidents. Because nuclear power and nuclear bombs are so fantastical and have a semi-mystical quality to them, these sorts of anecdotes tend to be told over and over again in popular culture. This book digs deeper and contains a bunch of nuclear-related accidents I had never heard of before. For example, I've heard the story of the Demon core many times before, but apparently there were parallel safety incidents that occurred in Russia that basically mirrored the demon core accidents, and that is rarely mentioned. This book is full of that kind of thing.I also really liked that Mahaffey managed to write a book about the history of nuclear accidents that spares no details but also leaves you feeling more confident in nuclear power. He's not putting a whitewash on nuclear power by any stretch of the imagination, but - presumably because he comes from a nuclear engineering background - he's not playing on the fear and disinformation that people have been spreading about nuclear power for ages.

What makes this book different is that the author is a pro advocate of. The nuclear power, but breaks down what went wrong, how it went wrong, what should or could have been done differently,, and if possible what was learned from it, in terms that are relatively understandable, for a non nuclear physicist. Yes at time it is overly simplified or optimistic, but you still get a full clear story, of everything from the development of the first atomic bombs, the \"tickling the dragon\" experiment, the mishandling of nuclear weapons, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima. You also learn about some of the mishaps and lax precautions at Hanford plutonium manufacturing plant, Rocky Flats plutonium trigger Manufacturing plant, and the bomb assembly plant Pantax in Texas.There are many wonderful books that cover each of these case study subjects exclusively and far more in depth such as 1. The Making of The Atomic Bomb- Richard Rhoades2. Full Body Burden- Kristen Iversen (Rocky Flats)3.

The author doesn't believe this but many Americans do--it is the basis of homeopathic medicine. The author is a great storyteller. There are at least a hundred scary stories in this book. I really like his use of slang and vivid descriptions of desperate actions as operators try to outthink the dreaded atomic piles. Now I know the difference between fast neutrons and slow neutrons. This is a big deal."}, {"userName": "Elaine Bennington", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29544470-elaine-bennington", "userReview": "I wondered--now I see. \"atomic accidents\" was a book I picked up on kindle almost as a Halloween story fest and I wish to be forgiven by the author. even though it is complicated reading, I could not put it down. Well written and even humorous in spots (like gallows humor), the book is a history of atomic fission, both bombs and reactors. it is a must-read for those of us who have worried about this issue and who yet know we must do away with coal plants. excellent writing from a real insider from nuclear reactors--read it and learn."}], "description": "A \u201cdelightfully astute\u201d and \u201centertaining\u201d history of the mishaps and meltdowns that have marked the path of scientific progress (Kirkus Reviews, starred review). Radiation: What could go wrong? In short, plenty. From Marie Curie carrying around a vial of radium salt because she liked the pretty blue glow to the large-scale disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima, dating back to the late nineteenth century, nuclear science has had a rich history of innovative exploration and discovery, coupled with mistakes, accidents, and downright disasters. In this lively book, long-time advocate of continued nuclear research and nuclear energy James Mahaffey looks at each incident in turn and analyzes what happened and why, often discovering where scientists went wrong when analyzing past meltdowns. Every incident, while taking its toll, has led to new understanding of the mighty atom\u2014and the fascinating frontier of science that still holds both incredible risk and great promise.", "title": "Atomic Accidents: A History of Nuclear Meltdowns and Disasters: From the Ozark Mountains to Fukushima", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20579068-atomic-accidents", "average": 4.2, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1396783468l/20579068.jpg", "reviews": 154, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7476706.James_Mahaffey", "name": "James Mahaffey"}], "type": ["History", "Science", "Nonfiction", "Audiobook", "Science"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20579068-atomic-accidents", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17654695-atomic-accidents", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20820098-atomic-accidents", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30756442-atomic-accidents", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20608458-atomic-accidents", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6600498-atomic-awakening", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32191825-atomic-adventures", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13135745-nuclear-accidents-and-disasters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13795249-nuclear-power-set-6-volumes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13795103-the-history-of-nuclear-power", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
