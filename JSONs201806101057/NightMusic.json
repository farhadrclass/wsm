Thankfully the setting at The Spanish House and some of the secondary characters saved it from being a complete trainwreck.-Isabelle was an infuriating character, I couldn't root for her or feel sorry for her even though she was grieving for her dead husband and her life had turned upside down. She was completely useless, she couldn't handle doing the most basic things without either screwing it up or whinging about it. She had zero common sense, it was remarkable how a woman of her age with two kids could willingly know so little about finances and parenting and the world in general. She was so lazy and stupid she didn't even get more than one quote for the work that needed doing on her house, she simply took dodgy Matt's word about prices and what needed doing, despite not knowing him or even finding out about his reputation as a builder before taking him on. What kind of idiot wouldn't at least call other builders for a quote? She said her husband sorted out things like that but that was still no excuse, any adult with a half a brain would know they needed to at least get a second opinion and quote before shelling out tens of thousands of pounds on important building work, even more so when the money being used was the only money the family had. There were so many more instances where Isabelle showed how lazy, dumb and useless she was.-The worst thing about Isabelle was the fact she chose to get married and have kids when she knew she couldn't ever love and support them how they needed. She was too in love with her violin and music to love anyone else, she knew that yet still decided to go ahead and be a wife and mother, it made her thoroughly unlikeable and selfish. -Matt was as irritating as Isabel, he was an entitled, deluded, self-obsessed, boring loser who never got any comeuppance for all the crap he pulled. The only satisfying ending would have been him suffering, which he didn't, instead he got a clean slate and his obedient wife at his beck and call. Laura was a complete twit staying with him when she knew he didn't love her or respect her, and was happily shagging half the village. She had a chance of a normal relationship and some happiness, but she threw it away so she could spend the rest of her life being Matt's doormat, it was such a depressing ending.-Hated how Asad and Henry were written, it was quite annoying how the author wrote them as gossips, physically weak, mother hens and so stereotypically gay. -I'm hoping the next Jojo Moyes book I pick up will be better than this one."}, {"userName": "Pilar", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42971826-pilar", "userReview": "3,5*Todo lo que escribe JOJO te hace disfrutar, sin ninguna duda.

I have often found books with a lot of hype surrounding them to be a bit disappointing when I get around to reading them, as was also the case with THE HUSBAND'S SECRET by Liane Moriarty. But when I went back to read her older books, I gobbled them up! So, that is the strategy I will employ here, too, I think.That said, I really did enjoy NIGHT MUSIC. I wasn't sure what to expect, typical, predictable chick-lit, or something with more depth, and I got the latter. The story revolves around the lives of a number of characters, which I always enjoy. I like there to be more than one POV, and feel it often helps to round out the story and flesh out the figures.The story in itself isn't radically new, a widow and her family move into a dilapidated house she inherited from a distant relation. What makes this book special is the thoughtful manner of Moyes' characterizations and the believability of the situation. There is romance, yes (nothing wrong with that), but nothing gratuitous or ridiculous. But what this story is really about is personal development and growth of the characters. I love it when the author shapes the story around characters, rather than making it seem as though the characters are merely bi-product of a plot outline, so this was perfect for me.I look forward to reading more from this author!Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com"}, {"userName": "Gail", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7052436-gail", "userReview": "I absolutely devoured this book from the outset. I just loved it, as I do with all Jo Jo Moyes's books.Initially, my heart totally broke for the delightful Isabel but watching her blossom and heal was just wonderful. I could visualise the ramshackle old house that she subsequently inherits at a totally desperate time of her life and, just when it seems nothing can possibly get worse, it does.Her neighbours, Laura and Matt, do nothing in the slightest to make her feel welcome to the village; on the contrary Matt is out for revenge and Laura is lost in her ever crumbling world. Byron was a fantastic character and his vast knowledge of how to live off the land was crucial to Isabel initially. I also liked Nicholas Trent who was gradually putting his life back together and was a lovely,charming man. I didn't have any idea what the ending would be and was racing along to finish it so I could actually sleep tonight (being up until the wee small hours this morning and only putting my kindle down when I couldn't keep my eyes open any longer).The only negative I can say is that I now have to wait until Jo Jo's next book!

There is just something so great about her writing.This novel follows the lives of the people in the little village where 'The Spanish House' is located. It's an old and derelict house, in need of a lot of repairs, but it is in a wonderful location by the lake. Matt and Laura have been coveting the house for years, and when the owner dies, they are hopeful that it will be left to them, but instead it goes into his intestate estate and is passed on to some distant relative, Isabel, leaving them bitterIsabel is newly widowed, and suffering financial difficulties. All Isabel ever wanted to do was devote her life to her music, but now with her husband gone, she has to try to provide for her children. When she finds out that she has inherited a house in the country, it seems like a great new start for her and her two children. But when they arrive, they realise that the house is much more than they bargained for, and the amount of work it needs is enormous. Matt offers to help Isabel to renovate, Isabel being unaware of his desire to own the house, and soon Isabel's problems begin to multiply. The book follows the families as they struggle with their ideas of love and marriage, revenge, family life, and what it takes to make a house a home.I don't know what it is, but even though none of the characters were particularly great people, even though I found Isabel and Laura annoying (bad life choices) and thought Matt was a complete psychopath, the story was still great, it still kept me interested.A great easy read, full of family drama."}, {"userName": "Thomas Str\u00f6mquist", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32669562-thomas-str-mquist", "userReview": "A book that was lended to my wife and that I picked up only because I\u2019m always open to sample something new (and I\u2019m always happy to have a book in my hand).

The last place they want to be is in an almost derelict house in a close-knit country village. Isabel is a successful violinist who doesn't get her hands dirty, her daughter Kitty is a sensible 15 year old who misses her friends and son Thierry has not spoken since his father was killed in a road accident a year ago.The family have to get to grips with country living, with having no money, no water, no bathroom and no fridge. They also have to cope with Matt McCarthy - the local builder who was convinced that The Spanish House would be left to him and his wife Laura. This is a great story of loss, bereavement and obsession. It has quite sinister undertones in places and the character of Matt is especially well created - starting out as the local friendly builder and gradually getting darker and more threatening as the story evolves.Another triumph from one of my favourite authors."}, {"userName": "R", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10572355-r", "userReview": "This was my second Moyes book - it was nothing like the deep and moving Me Before You.

(I gravitate towards authors from the British isles.) This novel wasn't published here that I could find, so I bought a used paperback from the U.K. The set-up is one I usually find irresistible: a character inherits an old house in the English countryside. I am very house-centric, and love nothing more than a good story with a house, preferably an old one with lots of history and architectural charm, at its center. Plus a beautiful setting, of course, or at least a lush cottage garden. (Unless it's a Gothic, which requires a more foreboding atmosphere.) Still, a story where the house - whether a stately manor, crumbling castle, or (my favorite) a charming cottage - is as integral to the story as a character. So I had fairly high expectations from this author treating one of my favorite plot elements. The book doesn't open with the central character, but another woman to whom the \"Spanish House\" has assumed tremendous importance. It is Laura's dream house, and her husband Matt, a building contractor, has promised it will be theirs one day. Meanwhile, the miserly and crotchety old man who owns it must be cared for and catered to since he has no family, and he will surely remember those who have tended him in his old age in his will. The house is in a sad state, for the old man hasn't maintained it for decades. Of course the builder and his wife were counting their chickens before they hatched, and, as any reader would know, the old man did not leave a will specifying his wishes, and the state found the nearest living relative to inherit his estate. Isabel is reeling from the death of her husband. Mother to a teenage daughter and eight-year-old son, Isabel is unprepared to cope with single parenthood. In fact, she can't cope with much of anything. She is a leading violinist with a symphony orchestra, where the demands of touring and her music career are central to her life, while her successful husband handled the finances, and a nanny took care of the children and other domestic duties. Now her son is so traumatized by his father's sudden death that he is not speaking, and her daughter has become the practical mature one, organizing bills and important papers for her mother who disregards them. I found Isabel not very likable - rather childishly dependent, burying her head in the sand and not facing reality - that her husband had in fact left them with burdensome debt and she and her children could not continue living the lifestyle they were accustomed to, nor in the London house where they had been a happy family. Then she receives a notice that she has inherited a large house and acreage in the country, so decamps from London with her mutinous children in tow.I had expected the usual fish-out-of-water scenario, and this did play out, with the charms of small village life eventually winning over the sophisticated city dwellers. The large estate house would of course be a money pit, but with some brilliant scheme would be saved. Not exactly. A property developer discovers it and thinks the unusual house on the lake would be an ideal setting for a development and waits for his moment to approach the owner. Meanwhile, the builder, Matt, who had designs on the house from the beginning and lives in the neighboring former coach house, befriends Isabel and offers to help set the house to rights. But he actually intends to make sure that Isabel will give up and leave, and sabotages the remodeling while over-charging her. Isabel of course is clueless. Finding her savings rapidly dwindling and little to show for it, she learns how to live off the land from the quiet and mysterious Byron, who once managed the grounds for the old owner but who now works for Matt. Isabel does change and grow, but I found her transformation from a woman with no domestic aptitude to a country woman who forages and grows her food and learns to hunt, as well as hang wallboard and connect plumbing, to be a rather large leap. She misplaces her trust and it isn't until the end that she realizes the extent of how she has been deceived.Moyes does a good job of revealing the characters. The bad guy is a total bounder, the good guy sympathetic, the children act age appropriate, and the village shopkeepers are wonderfully drawn. I just wished that Isabel had more sense, or at least awareness, and displayed a little more gumption in confronting men. She does get there in the end, but through most of the book she is annoyingly vulnerable and overwrought, and of course men find her irresistibly attractive. Yet I still found her story compelling and I was totally drawn in. I have to give Moyes the credit for crafting a novel that I eagerly devoured, even while finding the main character rather aggravating. And as for the house? Sadly, it was a disappointment - an architectural mishmash, desired but unloved, its integrity compromised, bricks and mortar that never felt like a home. Sometimes the sacrifices a fading mansion requires are just not worth it, and home is simply where comfort and happiness is found. Oh, by the way, I did catch the author's wink when Byron 'Firth' emerged from the lake in all his male magnificence. I laughed out loud."}, {"userName": "Mycoton32", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5617744-mycoton32", "userReview": "http://www.leslecturesdemylene.com/20...15/20 - J'ai beaucoup aim\u00e9 cette fresque familiale, son intrigue et la plupart des personnages :D"}, {"userName": "Anna J.

Isabel is as helpless and naive as a child, to a point where she ignores her children to a degree bordering on child neglect. Her husband dies in an accident. The fmaily is forced to leave their expensive lifestyle behind and move to the country, where the drama around the Spanish house takes place.The Delancys inherit (plothole #1) the ramshackle house. The lovely neighbours, the McCarthys, picturing the dumbest housewive in literature and a handsome (unfortunately a psychopath) husband and a teenage son, want the house too. (plothole#2) The random estate agent (cz Mrs McCarthy needs a love story too) wants the house too. And let's not forget the ex-convict with the sexy hips and cute dogs (he, for a change, is not interessted in the house)The plot devices get repetitive: everyone has a crush on everyone. Everybody is cheating. All of them are emotional drama queens.I liked the gay shopkeers! That's that. The story takes nearly half of the book to get going. Everything leading up to \"the action parts\" just drags and drags, the house demolition and Isabels inner misery. We get so many POVs that I stopped caring right after the first chapters.It ends with a big drama.

Night Music is the next on my list and was first published in 2008. Unlike a lot of Moyes\u2019 work, it does not have both a contemporary and a historical section but has a multitude of characters to get to grips with and, as always, I found the characterisation to be near perfect. As the novel opens, we are introduced to Laura and Matt McCarthy who have looked after their elderly, very obnoxious and ungrateful neighbour for a while now, not out of the kindness of their hearts but in the hope that when he dies, he will leave them his house \u2013 \u201cThe Spanish House,\u201d in his will. Instead of this happening however to their disgust and bitter disappointment when he passes away the house is bequeathed to his grand-niece Isabel Delancey who is living in London with her two children.The house couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for Isabel. Recently widowed after her husband died in a horrific car accident, Isabel has really been struggling. She lives, breathes and speaks music and is an accomplished professional violin player which sees her travelling round the world. Her husband had always dealt with the financial side of things and the children were looked after by a nanny so when he dies her world all but implodes. Her daughter Kitty has had to grow up very quickly frantically trying to manage the bills that her mother cannot cope with and her poor younger brother Thierry has not spoken a word since his father\u2019s death. She finally makes her mother pull her head from the sand and face facts in that they cannot afford the lifestyle that Isabel has become accustomed to. Luckily, at this point, the family are thrown a lifeline in The Spanish House and they immediately up sticks and move to the country and try and settle into the difference that living in a small village community offers.There is no way that things are going to be easy for them though. First of all, the house is a complete mess, almost as if it is falling apart from the inside outwards and as I\u2019m sure you can imagine, Isabel is no Miss DIY! Step forward Matt McCarthy, her knight in shining armour/builder extraordinaire. Or is he? Yes, this is the same Matt who desperately wants The Spanish House for himself and although he is instantly attracted to Isabel he is determined to sabotage the house (literally, with shoddy worksmanship) while charging her extortionate amounts for the privilege. And of course Isabel is so incredibly gullible and naive with things like this so she doesn\u2019t see what\u2019s happening right under her nose. As Matt attempts to drive Isabel and her family away from The Spanish House things begin to unravel very quickly and soon result in a dangerous obsession. Step forward Isabel\u2019s (actual?) knight in shining armour, Byron Firth who works for Matt but knows exactly what kind of man he is and attempts to help Isabel through the mess she finds herself in. On a side note, many thanks to the author for giving me a fit of giggles when Byron Firth emerges all wet and dripping from a lake \u2013 wonder where her inspiration for that scene lay?!I have to be honest and say this isn\u2019t my favourite from Jojo Moyes work but it\u2019s definitely worth the read. Other reviewers have mentioned that they didn\u2019t really see the point in the Laura/Matt \u201cstory on the side,\u201d but for me, I found it a nice addition. Matt is an awful character and has cheated on his wife multiple times yet she continues to stay with him. I found myself almost pulling my hair out in frustration with her merely accepting his behaviour and thought their toxic marriage brought a sinister edge to the novel, something I\u2019ve never seen before in a Jojo Moyes book. Isabel frustrated me too but in different ways and I ended up feeling differently towards the end of the novel. At the beginning, she appears to put her music before her family, sticks her head in the sand when faced with problems and is so incredibly gullible and naive it made me want to scream! Losing her husband and having to confront her problems made her grow up immensely and let her prove a better mother to her children as a result. If there was one character I didn\u2019t really connect with it was Byron Firth (despite the wet shirt scene) who didn\u2019t seem as \u201cfleshed out,\u201d as her other characters and I felt he had real potential to be more interesting. Apart from this, Night Music is a great read. I think Moyes\u2019 fans will lap it up and it will hopefully bring a lot more new readers to her fan base.For my full review, please see my blog at http://www.bibliobeth.com"}], "description": "The Spanish House is known to locals as an architectural folly, and it is now nearly derelict to boot.
