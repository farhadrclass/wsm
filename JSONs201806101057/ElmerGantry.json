We have come together to celebrate this book, the revelation of eternal truth, showing the sins of man in his most hideous shape! Read! Recant! Redeem yourselves! Listen to the words of universal wisdom, and confess! Have you ever committed the sin of vanity? Is hypocrisy foreign to you? Do you feel secret joy when you succeed in manipulating people to act in your favour?I can't do it. I find myself recoiling in disgust even as I try copying Elmer Gantry's attitude to beat him with his own weapons. There is a bitter truth in the fact that a few vocal hypocrites with basic rhetorical skills and enough confidence to take for granted that all people should listen to them gain so much power and assemble crowds, while careful thinkers who ponder their words and look at causes and effects before they judge a situation remain in the shadows.Elmer Gantry would have done a better job of selling the important message of the book, burning it in exaltation or yelling out his Doomsday message to the listening crowds. Or maybe his vanity would have prevented him from completely rejecting a story that is all about HIM? Not a favourable story, true, but centred around that massive ego nonetheless!Rarely have I hated a character more than Elmer Gantry, and that is worrying, considering how many incarnations of him spread their messages around the world at the moment. His ambitious mother sets the stage for him, wishing for him to become a preacher to satisfy her vanity. Elmer builds a career on speaking the words of the Bible, exploiting the Christian messages to gain power and license to do whatever he desires for himself. Whenever he is caught in an act of sin (as defined by himself from the pulpit, in a show of sublime hypocrisy), he uses the tools of his profession to turn the case against the accusers.It is symptomatic that he is repeatedly shown to be of mediocre intelligence, finding it hard to understand the full context of literary texts, but that he excels in implementing vocabulary to impress people of even less education:\"He wasn't altogether certain what it meant, but it had such a fine uplifting roll. 'Blasphemous fable and dangerous deceit'. Fine!\"Or, even more revealing:\"Personally, he did not find that he cared so much for Browning. There were so many lines that he had to read three or four times before they made sense, and there was so much stuff about Italy and all those wop countries.But Browning did give him a number of new words for the notebook of polysyllables and phrases which he was to keep for years, and which was to secrete material for some of his most rotund public utterances.\"It strikes me that I should actually give Gantry credit for writing down those hard polysyllables in a notebook, as most politicians nowadays would use a teleprompter or just write them on the palm of their hand? There was craft in his hypocritical speeches still!I could add countless anecdotes from the book, proving over and over again that Elmer Gantry is a stupid, sexually abusive, narcissistic character who gets away with everything because he grasps the power of basic vocabulary that is spit out in a state of rage and indignation. He is an abominable colleague, husband, lover (if the label can even be applied to what he does to women), and Uriah Heep pales beside him in 'is 'umble approach to deceit and self-indulgence. As opposed to the rival of David Copperfield, though, Elmer Gantry does not end up spreading his poison in prison. He concludes with the confirmation that his is a pattern that will be successful in future as well, his closing words dripping with the author's sarcasm and involuntary prophetic power:\"We shall yet make these United States a moral nation!\" #MAMA?Beware of the moral ideas of Elmer Gantry, America!Bravo, Sinclair Lewis, I would like to say! What a brave act of honesty. What insight into the propagandistic world of preachers (of religion or ideology).

I say, brothers and sisters lend me your ear! I have read the words of Mr. Sinclair Lewis as set down in the good book Elmer Gantry in which this author of the early 20th century condemns organized religion, most notably the Baptist Church. His main character, a one Mr. Elmer Gantry, as the title suggests, is an most insincere and hypocritical preacher of the faith. Insincere and hypocritical! Yes sah, that is the crux, the very essence of the text. A text of greater length than needs be, though great enough for the showing of many a various facet of the numerous Christian sects. Elmer himself floats most randomly from one to the other like the lowest sinner descending the layers of Hell, where evil takes on many a cunning disguise. Nothing is as it seems there, as can be said with Elmer Gantry where even \"Scotty\" the golf pro is not an actual Scot, but a fraud who's learnt his false accent from a Liverpudlian Irishman! False deceptors, ye be damned! Thus is the condemnation of Sinclair Lewis, a man who him very self has aspersion cast upon him. Yes, it is true, my brothers and sisters! Though Mr. Lewis condemns the wayward ways of organized religion's leaders, he also condemns hisself, literally invoking his own name within these pages through the mouth of a criticizer of the author's past works. Though he does this, still upon publication the people's of the State of New Hampshire, once known as the \"Live Free or Die\" State, invited Mr. Lewis to a New Hampshire jail cell. And the people of Virginia promised to hang, yes I said hang the good author for the work he had done...I ask you, brothers and sisters, is this Christianity? Is this God's will?"}, {"userName": "J Cravens", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1776905-j-cravens", "userReview": "Just before the 4th of July, I finished Elmer Gantry. It turned out to be one of the greatest novels I have ever read. Elmer Gantry, published in 1927, was so much more complex, so much more biting and chilling in its description of the worst parts of the American psyche, so much more timeless, than I ever imagined it would be. I expected a comic-book story and dated prose -- I got, instead, vivid characters and lines of text I found myself re-reading per their beautiful structure and perfect descriptions. This book isn't just as it's usually, simply described: adventures of a golden-tongued evangelist who lives a live of hypocrisy and self-indulgence. This also isn't a novel whose primary, sole purpose is to attack the clergy. Elmer Gantry is a searingly-accurate profile of the USA, one that still stands oh-so-many years later. I finished the book and sat staring out the window for 10 minutes. I didn't know whether to laugh or weep.What's so disheartening about this book, for me, is, as noted in the afterword by Mark Schorer, \"The forces of social good and enlightenment as presented in Elmer Gantry are not strong enough to offer any real resistance to the forces of social evil and banality.\" Frank Shallard is defeated. So is Jim Lefferts. All the good people go down.Maybe you have to have been raised in the South or Midwest of the USA, and to have been brought up Baptist or Methodist, to really, truly get all the layers of Elmer Gantry, all the hidden humor, all the razor-sharp and, at times, incredibly subtle, criticism and commentary. If you've never been to a church supper where a person claims to have traced their lineage all the way back to Adam and Eve, if you have never had your school board or local city council hear arguments about why certain books should be banned from school or local libraries, if a significant number of your family wouldn't boycott your wedding if you chose to serve alcohol, if you have never heard Catholics called \"Papists\" from a pulpit, if school friends haven't told you, in all sincerity, that they are going to pray for you because of your questions and intellect, if you haven't heard \"Christians\" rationalize about their actions that are in direct conflict to what the Bible says, I'm not sure you can really, truly get this book. But I could be wrong (I frequently am)Ofcourse, all you have to have done is lived in the USA and paid attention to the actions of Jerry Fallwell, Pat Robertson and the Christian Coalition in order to be chilled by the last line of the novel -- and don't go reading it before you've read the entire book. Part of me is ashamed to have only finally read Sinclair Lewis when I'm already past 40 -- and part of me wonders if I could ever have understood this book on the level I feel that I do had I not been this age.And don't go looking for these characters, nor this story, in the movie version. The events of the movie are less than 100 pages of the book, and are so incredibly sanitized in comparison -- the novel's Sharon Falconer is NOTHING like the Celluloid version. I love the movie, but it's a completely different story.Sinclair Lewis is quoted as saying \"I love America, but I don't like it\" and \"when fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross.\" My sentiments exactly."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "BkC 56Rating: 4.25* of fiveThe Publisher Says: Today universally recognized as a landmark in American literature, Elmer Gantry scandalized readers when it was first published, causing Sinclair Lewis to be \"invited\" to a jail cell in New Hampshire and to his own lynching in Virginia. His portrait of a golden-tongued evangelist who rises to power within his church - a saver of souls who lives a life of hypocrisy, sensuality, and ruthless self-indulgence - is also the record of a period, a reign of grotesque vulgarity, which but for Lewis would have left no record of itself. Elmer Gantry has been called the greatest, most vital, and most penetrating study of hypocrisy that has been written since Voltaire.My Review: I grew up in a single-parent household. My mother was a pedophile, and I was her philed pedo. She was also the most thunderational kind of christian nutball, the most conservative kind of social fascist conformist, and a chilly, appearance-obsessed harpy. Unless you were a stranger, when she presented as a pious, charming, lovely woman.So Elmer Gantry was, for me, a documentary not a novel. I read it at maybe fifteen or so, just after I read Babbitt, and was astounded to read my own experiences of the asshole religiosifiers who surrounded me in a book over fifty years old! I hated them, powerfully and corrosively, then as now, and there was for me a giant pouring of balm over my outraged soul as I read this book: These people aren't the first! These people didn't invent this idiocy! If Lewis escaped to tell about it, so can I! The rise of Fox News and Rush Limbaugh and that ignorant ilk is not new, ladies and gents, it's happened before. This novel will show you that this kind of perverted conservative religious stupidity has always been with us, and its basic small-souled evil isn't unique to our times either.Depending on my mood, that's either a comfort or a misery. But it always makes me feel less alone, less like I'm missing something and misinterpreting other things, to read this classic expos\u00e9 of the long-standing culture of ignorant and evil exploitive \"salvation artists.\"\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "Bigoted Bully in the Business of Beliefs\nFamous Gassy Preacher Sounds Call for ContributionsA timeless, albeit rather tame, tale of a bigoted bully (who seems close to insanity at times) abuses his power in the name of religion, serially succumbing to temptations of the flesh and the pitfalls of arrogant pride. I frankly expected a more powerful condemnation, but then recalled this novel is set in the early 1900s. It's shameful that the charlatans have only worsened in this country. And yet, it could be even worse: a world in which the USA has hoisted a bigoted, bullying, unbalanced demagogue to political power.

He is the living embodiment of a wolf in sheep's clothing. Unfortunately, this is not a book that can be read on the surface and be done with. Elmer Gantry isn't a cut-and-dried villain. On the contrary, it is his very humanness that makes his story equal parts repulsive and irresistible. We see in Gantry's hypocrisy our own inclination to INTEND to be better than we ever actually are. You can only hate him as far as you hate yourself. But, oh, did I hate him. Especially the way he treated his long-suffering wife and children. I just wanted to punch him in the face.There is so much more to this book than just the behavior of the title character. It raises issues of religion and prejudice. It illustrates the uncomfortable reality that in real life wickedness is not always punished and righteousness is not always rewarded. It holds a mirror up to our self-righteous behavior; the way we vociferously condemn vice in its obvious forms, but ignore our own, more damaging, un-Christian-like behavior toward others. It also reminds us that those we put our trust and faith in are not always deserving of that trust.I wish that I had the time and mental focus to review this book to the full extent it deserves. There's really a lot to it. But suffice it to say that while reading this book wasn't diverting (aside from the fantastic prose), it was beneficial."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "I've read that this novel caused quite a furor when it was released, even being denounced by Billy Sunday. Well, I wouldn't know, I wasn't there, but it wouldn't surprise me as I remember when some Christians got very \"excited\" about the movie \"The Last Temptation of Christ\". All they accomplished in my opinion was drawing more attention to the movie than it would otherwise have garnered.As for Elmer Gantry, I am a Christian and this book does arguably, take a pretty dim view of some or possibly most Christians. Gantry is basically a ne'er-do-well who starts out in law and is side tracked by alcohol and his \"womanizing\" ways. He is more or less accidentally ordained as a Baptist minister. Later on he becomes a Methodist. Gantry manages to destroy several lives throughout the book and leaves a trail of broken people among those who are close to him. For a while he becomes the \"manager\" (and lover) of Sharon Falconer a character who seems to be loosely based on Aimee Semple McPherson. When Falconer is killed in the fire that destroys her new tabernacle his \"career\" is over there.Gantry never gets his \"comeuppance\" in that he marries well and gets his own congregation.As for it's reflection on Christian life and Christians anyone who follows the news knows that there are people who make money from those who want badly to believe. It is of course a fallacy to construe that all Christians fall into the crooked and/or gullible paradigm. Unfortunately (and most Christians are aware of this) we need to \"be aware\" of those who would twist the Gospel (good-news) teaching of Christ to a money making venture. As in other areas Lewis approach while not ideal does show up an area where awareness is needed.I settle on 3 stars as while the book has it's points the writing isn't really among the \"greatest\" and the book does take advantage of prurient interest. In other words, for it's day, its quite racy (staying this side of actual porn which of course has been around a while). The book is readable and while I wouldn't use the word \"enjoyable\" as we watch several lives more or less destroyed, it is interesting and well plotted. In the end, it must be admitted, the character of Gantry is well formed even if some of the supporting cast isn't. Gantry is one of a handful of literary characters to become at least fairly iconic. Most know that a reference to \"Elmer Gantry\" is a reference to a dishonest and probably \"immoral\" (debauched, depraved?) clergyman."}, {"userName": "Ken", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/752259-ken", "userReview": "Sinclair Lewis' writing always sticks with me. Perhaps it is because he so wonderfully savaged American culture, laying out all its ills, prejudices, and hypocrisies as a feast for the reader. The characters he presented to us--Elmer Gantry, George Babbitt, Samuel Dodsworth, and Will Kennicott-- were bright smiling neighbors that revealed the grotesque in American values.Of these Elmer Gantry, the title character of Lewis' 11th novel, still rings the most true, if for no other reason than that the tomfoolery Lewis witnessed in tent preachers has grown exponentially into the likes of Oral Roberts, Jerry Falwell, Trinity Broadcasting, and the Christian Family coalition. In 1927, Lewis saw evangelical preachers as frauds, more hellbent on raising money and controlling their congregations than actually saving souls. The morality was suspect, a sales point. Lewis would have relished the arrival of a preacher like Creflo Dollar who insists business advice can be found in the bible.It goes without saying that Lewis' work always had something to say, a larger social commentary that infuses all of his novels. But he was also one of America's best satirists. There are infinite moments of hilarity in Elmer Gantry in spite of the horror. The first line of the novel is a great example of his style:\"Elmer Gantry was drunk. He was eloquently drunk, lovingly and pugnaciously drunk.\"Or there is Elmer's rejection of Lulu Bains:\"Once or twice in his visions he had considered that there might be danger of having to marry her. He had determined that marriage now would cramp his advancement in the church and that, anyway, he didn't want to marry this brainless little fluffy chick, who would be of no help in impressing rich parishioners.\"NPR recently featured a look back on the novel, which includes snippets from the Academy-Award-winning film adaptation starring Burt Lancaster. While it is not a purely faithful adaptation of the book, Lancaster is fantastic in the role as Gantry; exuding that strange mix of religious cheerleader, drunken thug, and linebacker for God.While I would admit that Babbitt is my favorite work by Lewis, I find myself more often reflecting back on Elmer Gantry. I'm happy to say I actually own one of the original 1927 editions. For my money, no book is better at shining a spotlight on all the flaws of Evangelical Christianity and its influence on America."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11351200-leslie", "userReview": "[ when despite having his hypocrisy revealed to the public, Elmer manages (with help) to bribe & threaten the witnesses and spin the press so that he ends up being the winner.

I will definitely need to explore other books by Sinclair Lewis. Wow. This man could WRITE! I don't know much about Lewis, but he must have had some extensive exposure to the Christianity of his day. I found this very educational regarding the religious landscape of America during the turn of the century. Baptists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Methodists, Pentecostals, Catholics, Mormons, New Thoughters are represented here with all their foibles and idiosyncrasies. A fascinating comparative study, to say the least; but, more prominently, a blistering rebuke on religious hypocrisy. Lewis set his cannons ablaze upon insincere Christianity. This story will make one stop dead-in-his-tracks before he tries to go into the ministry for status or prestige. Is ministry simply an opportunity for upward mobility? Does it stroke the ego? Does it place us in an admiring light? Is it a chance to garner influence? Do we enjoy flattery? Vie for authority? Do we yearn for greatness? If the answer is yes to any one of these, then Lewis is gunning for you. The Dr. Rev. Elmer Gantry started out as an unsuspecting, jovial, young seminarian who didn't have a clue what he was getting into. But, he was promised that if he went into the ministry he could really make a difference in the world. Think again, Elmer. There's more that goes into it than that. Yet he blithely went along as an out-and-out fraud, seeking for worldly acclaim. And as he ascended the corporate ladder, each rung became more and more precarious. I sat enthralled the entire way. A humorous, yet convicting read. Highly recommended for seminarians and young aspiring leaders."}, {"userName": "J.G.

His biting, insightful, and humorous look at religious hypocrisy is as pertinant today as it was when it was first written.The pure strength of Lewis's prose is refreshing after reading more recent authors. His control and understanding of syntax, grammar, and words maintains a strength and clarity of voice throughout the work. However, he does not sacrifice wit or levity for all his precision.There are occasions when his passion overcomes him and his critiques fall a little heavy-handed, but these moments are rare and short. He never falls to the sort of surrogate lecturing that many 'political' authors do, and so does not risk boring or underestimating his reader.He certainly never partakes in the more grievous sin of lecturing the audience as the narrator. Indeed, he rarely makes a point towards his own opinions without undermining it with a little hypocrisy or hubris on the character's part.The absurdity of Voltaire's satire has nothing on the ridiculous yet believable world created by Lewis. Hyperbole is the haven of the idealist. Realism is more interested in engaging reason than inciting passion, and while Lewis's understated wit never insults his reader's intelligence, it still presents an unsettling and prescient view of power, ignorance, and the masses."}, {"userName": "Mikey B.", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1484029-mikey-b", "userReview": "A truly delightful novel. Lewis takes obvious pleasure from poking fun at religion \u2013 and he takes on the various church denominations and destroys them with attacks from multiple positions. He exposes hypocrisy through Elmer Gantry \u2013 who supposedly is a protector of morality while enhancing his career by vapid publicity, name-calling and disdaining the women who fall in love with him. He also ignores his family while pursuing his goals.This book exposes the lust for power behind the evangelical movements and more traditional churches. It is also about the cult of personality \u2013 in this case Elmer Gantry. This is even more abundantly clear with the Sharon Falconer episode. Actually the book looses some of the momentum, I feel, after the sudden death (dubious at that) of Sharon midway through the story. Nevertheless what follows is Elmer\u2019s continuing journey through the religion business. Elmer switches convictions whenever there is opportunity for his advancement. There are a host of colourful characters. Most of the religious ones are portrayed as extremely flawed.

The fictional Elmer Gantry rises to prominence before the era of radio and TV evangalism, but his greed, self-serving political ambitions, and sexual indiscretions are just like those of his real-life counterparts.I actually listened to part of this audiobook while mistakenly thinking the author was Upton Sinclair. Duoh! How embarrassing. Besides having similar names, the authors were contemporaries who wrote about similar topics in the same time period, and their style is similar as well, though Lewis is a bit more satirical while Sinclair is more pedagogical. But both of them write bitingly about the foibles of early 20th century America.Elmer Gantry follows the protagonist from his beginnings as an irreverent student at a religious university who's basically browbeaten into being \"saved\" by another traveling preacher who turns out to be a cynical fraud himself. But Elmer is set out on his path, and goes to seminary to become a Baptist preacher. After getting caught with one of his flock, he's kicked out by the Baptists. He becomes assistant (and lover) to a crazy woman evangelist named Sharon Falconer, who on the one hand is as phony as he is, and on the other seems to really believe every bit of nonsense she spouts. Her character was quite interesting; today we'd probably call her bipolar, and she seems to be the one woman Elmer truly loves, as he remembers her for the rest of his life, even when he moves on to bigger and better venues after losing her.He spends a little time doing whacky New Age spirituality and \"self-help\" seminars (yes, this stuff was going around 80 years ago too) before he manages to con himself into the Methodist church, and pretty soon he's a minister. From there he keeps moving on to bigger and bigger churches, becoming more and more powerful, and always as hypocritical, self-centered, greedy, and rapacious as ever.This was a great story for its study of hypocrisy and very cynical and realistic examination of religion in America. (Sinclair did his homework, sitting in on a lot of church services to write this.) It's not exactly an indictment of Christianity and shouldn't be taken that way -- the novel doesn't take a stand on the rightness or wrongness of any particular religious beliefs, only on the all-too-realistic behavior of the clergy and parishioners. Sinclair writes a straightforward story with lots of minor characters, each of them very human and flawed and interesting. By the end of the book, you're really, really hoping that Elmer Gantry will finally get his comeuppance, but despite many close calls and setbacks over the course of his career, Gantry is like an eel who always seems to wriggle his way out of the worst of his difficulties.I recommend this highly as American literature set in the same time period as the novels of Upton Sinclair and F.

He had a beautiful new morning coat, three excellent lounge suits, patent leather shoes, a noble derby, a flourishing top hat, but he had only two suits of underclothes, both ragged. His socks were of black silk, out at the toes. For breast-pocket display, he had silk handkerchiefs; but for use, only cotton rags torn at the hem. He owned perfume, hair-oil, talcum powder; his cuff links were of solid gold; but for dressing-gown he used his overcoat; his slippers were a frowsy pulp; and the watch which he carried on a gold and platinum chain was a one-dollar alarm clock.\"This innocuous description, buried halfway through Elmer Gantry, perfectly characterizes Elmer. The contrast of his outer appearance and inward state reflects the glaring hypocrisy of his actions and doctrines. But simply characterizing Elmer Gantry as a hypocrite doesn't capture the infuriating aspect of his personality. Yes, he's a hypocrite, but what's disturbing is his lack of self-awareness. He understands that his womanizing, drinking, and exploitation are wrong, but he justifies these actions by saying things like \"no one is perfect\" and \"I'm just a man, after all.\" It's sickening. Although the novel focuses primarily on Elmer and bears his name, it's misguiding to say that the novel is primarily about the his rise to prominence. The story is really about specific events along Elmer's journey--specifically, the characters and that he encounters as he grows older. The novel with the most similar structure would be, ironically, John Bunyun's Pilgrim's Progress, which follows Christian's journey from sin to salvation. Elmer is the perfect foil for Christian's earnest quest for holiness.The effect of this episodic organization is intentional: The characters change as a result of their encounters and trials, but the focus of the novel becomes the incidental characters and the ideas that they represent. While Pilgrim's Progress is allegorical, illuminating the trails of life and the Christian's pursuit of holiness in the grimness of the world, Elmer Gantry is strictly satirical. By using the same method of organization, Sinclair expertly creates caricatures that represent different aspects of the protestant clergy and laity in early 20th century America. He encounters preachers, elders, deacons, bishops, politicians, lawyers, bartenders, sinners, saints, students, professors, and choirgirls that seem uncomfortably familiar. Like the pharisees that Jesus criticized, Elmer and his cronies are \"whitewashed tombs\" who \"look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean\" (Mt 23:27). Elmer Gantry remains a prophetic warning concerning the corruptibility of the human heart and misguided ambition.\u2022 \u2022 \u2022Also, Chapter 17 was one of the most convicting chapters that I've ever read."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/273793-mark", "userReview": "I have never despised a literary character as much as Elmer Gantry, and that is exactly what Sinclair Lewis wanted.Elmer Gantry will rise up and give you that old time religion, even if he doesn't have it himself.Elmer Gantry will be at the head of the pack to find and condemn vice, and when he's not with the pack he'll still be out finding vice.Elmer Gantry will be a Baptist, an evangelical, a New Thoughter, a Methodist, and is wondering about those Episcopalians.

And that little 0.1% that isn't only about him simply makes the rest seem worse.But let us hear from Brother Lewis a little bit about Brother Gantry's thoughts when he is with Aimee Semple McPherson, I mean Sharon Falconer:It was not her eloquence but her healing of the sick which raised Sharon to such eminence that she promised to become the most renowned evangelist in America. People were tired of eloquence; and the whole evangelist business was limited, since even the most ardent were not likely to be saved more than three or four times. But they could be healed constantly, and of the same disease.Back to my regular voice. I really think it is the 0.1% of goodness inside of Elmer that stops him just barely short of being a caricature and transforms him from inhuman into a human monster. And it is the 1% of sincere people, both sincere believers and sincere doubters, that make the hypocrites so much worse. It can be a downer reading how the hypocrites \"lay up treasure on earth\" while the sincere most assuredly do not. At the same time the sheer boisterous energy of Gantry picked me up by the scruff and dragged me, willing or not, through the book. You can't help wondering about American culture knowing that in 1927 this was both the #1 selling and the #1 banned book in the country."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth\u262e ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/990216-elizabeth", "userReview": "This book, I think, was written to reflect the frustration a person might feel when listening to a sermon of epic proportion or perhaps a person proselytizing: weary. Lewis is condemning not only ministers (the people that are the vessels of God), but religion itself. He paints Gantry as a man that is uncertain of his belief in God, but confident of his ability as a charismatic speaker and so Gantry becomes an ordained Baptist minister. When that religion doesn't work out for him, he finds a home elsewhere. And that's the problem. This goes on for 476 pages. Gantry drinks, he smokes, he is a womanizer and when he gets married he philanders. He lies at every opportunity (even to himself) to get what he wants. There is never a lesson learned because Gantry gets away with his bombastic behavior throughout the book. And that gets boring.The writing is good, most of the time, but I found that often there were sentences that were fragmented and I wasn't sure if that was intended or bad editing. On a good note, I learned the word jeremiad (n: a prolonged lamentation or complaint; a cautionary or angry harangue) which I will incorporate into my conversations from this point forward."}, {"userName": "Francis", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5792975-francis", "userReview": "The character Elmer Gantry is righteous, strident, repetitive, hypocritical and a lot of other things none of which are complementary, and for me, that was the problem with the book. The flat and one dimensional characters that inhibit Sinclair Lewis novels and especially the constant hammering of his message. I read Babbitt a couple of weeks ago and I enjoyed it. My mistake was returning to Lewis too soon. Rather than a new novel this felt like the sequel. Like watching Woody Allen films, entertaining, yes, but always somehow feeling like the same movie being viewed on a different set.There are many good points about Lewis and his novels, for me though, Lewis's message came through a little too much like his protagonist, righteous, strident and repetitive and ultimately like anything repeated too frequently ..it became a bit boring."}, {"userName": "Vicki Jacobs", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1388226-vicki-jacobs", "userReview": "One impression I got from this book is how similar the evangelist Gantry and his coherts are to the Taliban. The evangelists in Lewis' book would do exactly what the Taliban has done or are currently doing in the middle east, imposing their interpretation of god's rules upon everyone, believer or not. They both endorse morality police and have ambitions to rule the world as they see fit."}, {"userName": "J.K.

This book reminds me of Mark Twain's famous quote:\"Religion was invented when the first con-man met the first fool.\""}, {"userName": "Beej", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/340401-beej", "userReview": "I would have given this book a four star rating if I didn't abhor Elmer Gantry as much as I do. He is the master manipulator, the king of scum, the glib tongued devil who sees the world only as it can serve him. A little synopsis of the story: Elmer Gantry is a handsome rogue, a sports hero, son of a religious woman whose dreams for him consist totally of his becoming a man of the cloth. He delights in whiskey and women even as he attends theology classes. Unfortunately for everyone, especially women, and especially young women, Elmer could persuade the devil himself to donate time, talent and money..especially money..to the church if it meant it would benefit Elmer Gantry.It isn't really Elmer who impressed me the most, however; it would have to be a little kittenish young lady we meet early on, named Lulu Bains. At first glance, Lulu doesn't seem to mean much to this novel but at a closer look, we realise Lulu is like the flawed thread that runs through an amateur's tapestry, making its ugliness even more apparent.Lulu Bains, kittenish, pink and fluffy, is an innocent we meet when Elmer comes as pastor to his first real church. He immediately decides he must 'have' her, and have her he does. Just as immediately, he loses interest. Of course.Lulu weaves in and out, through Elmer's life. She doesn't matter to him. No big surprise. Nothing matters to Elmer except Elmer. But he keeps her, beguiled, on the back burner just in case he wants to toy with her more.Eventually, the obvious happens; he meets someone he likes better and chucks her to the curb, fibbing to her that his wife (yes, there is a Mrs. Gantry..Cleo..but he doesn't like her, either.) has found them out. Gantry tells Lulu she needs to not only leave him, she needs to leave his church altogether. This is quite a blow to Lulu; she has loved Gantry through his trek as a young minister all the way to his esteemed position as a nationally reknown religous figure.Now this is the good part, the telling part. Is Lulu bitter? Has her love turned to hatred? NO!'She crawled out after a time, a little figure in a shabby topcoat over her proud new dress. She stood waiting for a trolley car, alone under an arc-light, fingering her new beaded purse, which she loved because in his generosity He ( notice the use of the capitalized H, as if Lulu thought of Elmer as God, Himself..[emphasis mine:]) had given it to her. From time to time she wiped her eyes and blew her nose and all the time she was quite stupidly muttering, \"Oh, my dear, my dear, to think I made trouble for you - oh, my dear, my very dear!\"If you read this book to then end in hopes that Elmer gets his just desserts, well...I won't spoil it for you. You will need to read it yourself to discover what happens. All in all, it's worth your time."}, {"userName": "Marcus Johnson", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15877526-marcus-johnson", "userReview": "Less than ten pages into this novel, I was hooked. I honestly felt as though Sinclair Lewis was capable of time travel, transported himself forward in time so he could sit next to me during worship services at multiple churches, then transported himself back to the 1920s so he could write about it. Seriously, it feels as though little has changed in the world of American Evangelicalism. This movement still has its rising celebrities with more ambition than humility, and more demonstrated passion than grace. It still claims relevance through its waging of a \"culture war,\" which demonizes secular education and behavior. Elmer Gantry never died; he just reincarnated generation after generation, and cloned himself into thousands of self-absorbed worship leaders.Still as a social commentary, Lewis's work has its strong and weak points. I loved his writing style; I have a few other books on my reading list for the summer, but I would like to explore Babbitt and Arrowsmith, eventually. He writes with a sense of humor and flamboyance that serves as the perfect paintbrush for this narrative of a flamboyant, arrogant preacher who covers his sinful, degenerate self with only the thinnest layer of faux-holiness. There were moments during this read in which I laughed out loud (best point: a conversation Gantry has with a minister, who derides Sinclair Lewis--best instance of self-deprecation ever), and moments of deep poignancy.That being said, I wish Lewis wasn't so dedicated to Elmer Gantry's success in the final third of the novel (the first narrates Gantry's rise and fall at the seminary, the second narrates his rise and fall as a traveling evangelist with Sharon Falconer; the final, his emergence as a Billy Sunday-type evangelist with global acclaim). By that final third, Gantry seemed to excel at being slime, so well that plot points that Lewis should have used to bring him down did not, not even a little. Granted, I'm not looking for happy endings, but that final story arc feels like it has no arc; it just ascends and ascends, with reminders along the way of the lives he ruins. It by no means detracts from the greatness of this novel; I just feel that Lewis' goal of demonstrating that, in American Evangelicalism, sometimes bad guys win, trumped the potential for a real character arc.Don't let that stop you from reading this novel, however. Every Christian, every nonbeliever--everyone--should read it. You'll see our religious institutions reflected in this book, a mirror that hasn't lost it's shine in almost 80 years."}, {"userName": "Paul Gaya Ochieng Simeon Juma", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19439030-paul-gaya-ochieng-simeon-juma", "userReview": "Everytime I go to Church, I will always remember Elmer Gantry and try to investigate the legitimacy and beliefs of my spiritual leaders. It is very sad when the person you trust to guide you through life is a hypocrite who is there to take advantage of your ignorance. At times, as seen in the book, we go to church in order to appear and win the approval of a certain group of people. The rich and learned don't believe and mostly they find themselves asking and questioning the bible and the relevance of God in their lives. Elmer Gantry is a spiritual leader or at least he pretends to be. As a believer, I know it is not good or rather not allowed for me to criticise a man of God. It is advised to stay away from their personal lives at all costs for the reason that they are human beings like us. The question then that I ask is what to do when you know that your pastor or leader is not living a pious life? Furthermore, are they all not living a pious life? Are they in church just because they want to satisfy their own selfish desires? And what do we do with the messages they preach to us?"}, {"userName": "Hank Pharis", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3610199-hank-pharis", "userReview": "It's been a long time since I saw the movie but the character always intrigued me. Burt Lancaster won the Academy Award for best actor and his performance was one of the best ever. Thus I wanted to hear the book. The movie only covers about the middle third of the story. There is a lot more in the novel. But as I remember it in the movie Elmer Gantry was kind of a mysterious character that was hard to figure out. He moved back and forth between seeming to be sincere and being blatantly hypocritical. In the novel he is a complete narcissist. He does vacillate back and forth between times of wanting to be sincere in his faith and great hypocrisy but bottom line everything is about him and his glory. But what most comes through is Lewis' hatred of virtually any form of Christianity. He apparently has a small amount of tolerance for liberals and higher critics but no respect whatsoever for revivalists, fundamentalists or Biblical Christianity. He reminds me of someone like Christopher Hitchens."}, {"userName": "Paul Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5912872-paul-kelly", "userReview": "Wow! This book paints an ugly face on a preacher who is trying to do the job without any real commitment to Christ or any real calling. It is set in the early part of the 20th Century and offers an interesting indictment on pioneering religion. I suppose Lewis intends to paint preachers with a rather black brush because he offers us no characters that are truly remarkable men of God. While the book could serve to anger those of us who are in ministry, perhaps it is a important look at how \"human\" spiritual leadership can be. I actually think the book is worth a read by anyone trying to following God in a ministry position."}, {"userName": "Ceci", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1349812-ceci", "userReview": "The prose could be better and some chapters are a little long, but on the whole this book makes an interesting read. What is amazing to me is that this satire on evangelic fervor remains so timely. Elmer Gantry provides insight to the American culture that remains fresh even to this day. The 1920s are long gone and yet this book points out that some things have not changed, including the hypocrisy of the charismatic pulpit.
