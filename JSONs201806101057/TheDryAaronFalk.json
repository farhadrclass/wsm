The writing is excellent, the pacing was quick with fully fleshed characters, and the ending was satisfying without being too cut and dry. Half the fun of this story is, even if you guess at the who, you probably won't guess the why until it's revealed. This was a perfect example of a book being extremely dark and terrifying without being overly graphic for the shock value.\"It wasn't as though the farm hadn't seen death before, and the blowflies didn't discriminate. To them there was little difference between a carcass and a corpse.\" Your attention; I have it, right? Those are powerful opening lines, and when placed within the full fledged prologue you have one of the most intriguing and gripping introductions to a book I have ever read. Please don't misunderstand, this isn't a break neck thriller that you rush to read in one sitting; it's more the slow, delicate sipping of a fine wine that you tend to gradually chug more quickly as you reach the bottom of the bottle. If someone asked me how I felt a police procedural should be written and what details should be included I would simply hand them a copy of this book and tell them to read it. I feel privileged to have found such a golden story to catalogue in my mind so early in the year; the complex web of deceit and lies in this farmland of Australia completely captivated me to the point I actually found myself trying to piece together the various mysteries while doing other daily activities.While the writing was excellent and the mysteries were well done, what placed this book in 5 star land for me was the depth and beauty given to the characters. I was so engrossed in these people that I actually felt present for each conversation; the descriptions of the setting were so incredible that I thought I would break out into a sweat at any moment from the drought I was mentally present for. I honestly can't think of a single complaint of what I would change about this book. While you may guess correctly on the \"whodunnit\" in both present day and past mysteries (due to a limited pool of characters to choose from) you likely won't guess why. I had missed a tiny clue, just as our characters did, which caused me to go down the wrong path and find myself just as shocked as the police officers. I adored the way the author chose to slowly unravel the plot and how she really ramped up the tension and action near the end where I felt my heart about to beat out of my chest. I'm attaching a footnote regarding the triggers in this book, so feel free to browse it at the end of this review if it's a concern for you. As I was browsing on Goodreads, I noticed this is set to be the first installment in a series featuring our main character Falk. I'm really torn on this, as I felt the ending was perfect as it was. I'm one of the few who doesn't like everything neat and tidy, and while The Dry gave us plenty of closure, it left a few things open which I felt gave the book that final umpf of power to shine above the rest. I'm a little worried that a series will continue to focus on beating that particular \"openness\" to death to the point nothing is left vague. On the other hand, I'm dying for more Aaron Falk! I'd love to see him handling more cases and I would really love to see a return of many other characters like Raco and Gretchen, but also some minor ones like Jamie and the doctor. Rambling now, but needless to say highly HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Please put this on your radar folks if you haven't yet. If you enjoy an excellent mystery that is a police procedural not heavy on the mundane details, this is for you. Incredibly well done and I'm absolutely FLOORED that this is a debut novel. I believe we'll be seeing much more of Harper to come.Thanks Lisa Jordan for sending me your personal copy last year. She mailed it all the way from Australia and it's been a blast discussing the creepy crawlies (read monsters) that live (read prowl) in the area there. You all are brave souls! *Trigger warning- if you've read the plot summary then you know the premise is a father shooting his family and then himself-the mystery is whether he truly was the guilty party or if someone else was and framed it to appear that way. While the author did a fantastic job of writing with respect and caution on such a disturbing subject, there is brief discussion of the shooting of the young son that may be disturbing for some readers. Overall, the story isn't graphic and the violence is mainly implied."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "Luke Hadler may have had a light on waiting for him when he came home, but something else from this wretched, desperate community had seeped through that front door and into his home. And it had been rotten and thick and black enough to extinguish that light forever. \nThe Dry actually makes me feel vindicated in my rating and review of Ritter's Bonfire last year. I got some criticisms that I was being too harsh toward a debut author; that a lot of thrillers follow a familiar format but that doesn't make them bad. Then, in swoops Harper here, a debut novelist, writing a mystery/thriller story whose foundations are very similar to Bonfire (and other works in the genre) and yet it is utterly gripping.You know how the bare bones of these stories go. The protagonist is a small-towner who leaves and becomes a cop (lawyer, P.I., etc.) in the big city, then returns to his/her hometown to figure out some unfinished business from the past and solve a new crime. They, of course, get caught up in the small town politics and tensions. Bonfire tried on this premise - unsuccessfully, in my opinion. Flynn did something very similar in Sharp Objects. The whole notion of \"genre\" generally relies on authors playing by a certain set of rules. Whether these recycled narratives work, however, depends on the details. Are the characters interesting? Is the writing compelling? Do we care? I think Harper did a great job on all three.Firstly, The Dry is atmospheric to an intoxicating extent. Harper uses really evocative description to make you feel the burning heat and the suffocating lack of moisture amid the drought in this rural Australian community. The sun blazes. The blowflies hover. It's the perfect place for a murder.Aaron Falk returns to his hometown after twenty years away to attend a funeral. The funeral is for his old friend Luke Hadler, Luke's wife Karen, and his six-year-old son Billy. The story goes that Luke cracked under the stress of financial pressure and shot his family, leaving only baby Charlotte alive, before putting a bullet in himself. But there's just enough doubt to make Falk question this popular verdict.Along with local police newbie, Raco, Falk finds himself drawn into the case, as well as the lives, tensions and conflicts of the people in the town. His own past gets dragged up and Falk is forced to question whether there might be some connection between what happened to Luke's family and what happened all those years ago.The author expertly leads us down several roads that turn out to be red herrings and manages to pull out a dramatic and surprising conclusion. If you're a suspicious mystery reader like me - as in, you suspect everyone - then you might guess who did it, but I doubt very much you will guess the whys. And I personally think this is what makes a good mystery - the unveiling of the tale and the whys of the crime are good enough to make it okay if you guess whodunnit.A really impressive start to this new series starring Aaron Falk.

Aaron Falk and his father were run out of their home in Kiewarra over twenty years ago over rumours of Aaron's hand in the death of Ellie Deacon. It was ruled a suicide and Aaron had an alibi, his best friend Luke. Aaron has returned to Kiewarra for the funeral of Luke, his wife, Karen and his son, Billy. It appears that Luke shot his family and then himself due to their poor financial state caused by the unrelenting drought. Aaron is now a financial investigator with the Melbourne Police and Luke's parents do not believe their son is responsible for such unforgivable acts. They ask a reluctant Aaron to see what he can find out.There is a mean and nasty streak running through the local community compounded by the never ending and relentless heat. Led by Mel and Dow Deacon, the old rumours about Aaron having a hand in Ellie's death are resurrected and a vociferous campaign against him begins. They are determined to hound him out for a second time and are not above using underhand and dirty tactics to achieve their aim. Aaron joins forces with local cop, Sergeant Raco, who has his own doubts about Luke's guilt. Evidence soon accrues that suggests Luke is innocent of wiping out his family. Aaron's memories of the past come to the fore and the mystery of Ellie's death runs as a concurrent thread. Aaron and Raco slowly begin to uncover the secrets, lies and fears buried in Kiewarra. The closer they come to the truth, the more they unsettle a killer willing to ignite a conflagration in a place ill equipped to handle it. The truth behind Ellie's death also begins to become clear.The author does an excellent job in bringing Kiewarra alive and the disparate characters that inhabit the place. It is a closed and intense community where people hold on to grudges and feelings with such fervour, as though letting them go would result in the disintegration of the self. The drought threatens livelihoods, and the heat raises stresses sky high. This is a well written story with a compelling narrative. The character development is so well done. The tension and suspense keep the reader totally enthralled. Cannot wait to see what Jane Harper writes next. Highly recommended and brilliant read. Thanks to Little, Brown for an ARC."}, {"userName": "Kristin (KC) - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4971692-kristin-kc---traveling-sister", "userReview": "*4.5 stars!*What a book. I had to sleep on this one. Not like, right on top of it, it was just a little to the left of my pillow, but I needed time to process. It\u2019s not as though this read was so incredibly intoxicating that I couldn't wrap my head around it\u2014quite the contrary, actually. The pace is steady and slow, verging on dull at times but never quite crossing that line. The plot itself is packed with twists, but they felt gentle and weren't especially shocking. So what did it for me? The atmosphere. The mood this author was able to ignite within me through words alone. The setting. The conditions of the \u201cdry\u201d land and the desperation of a small Australian town facing the disastrous effects of a two-year drought. All of this came alive. Even the school kid\u2019s artwork in this story displays a dire tone\u2026brown grass and dead cows. Talk about getting a message across. Now pile onto that a young girl's unresolved death lingering in the stale air; the recent murder of a mother and son; the suicide of a husband, and a town full of suspects. I\u2019d say the tone is expertly set, and yes, it\u2019s bleak and dreary and despairing and you can feel it. You can see it. You can almost taste it \u2014 And that\u2019s how well this author has created this world. As for the intricacies and puzzles of the plot, I\u2019d say they were decent and held my interest fairly securely throughout. However, nothing *wow\u2019d* me as much as the visuals drawn out and the theme\u2014solid, creative, and original\u2014keeping present until the very end. Definitely recommend to thriller readers seeking a slower pace, but one that still delivers some substance."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11889829-suzanne", "userReview": "5 unflinchingly bright hot stars for 'The Dry'Love having reading friends to share books with!

Jane Harper, you hooked me at page 1, sentence one.As a reader, I am immediately FEELING this dusty, angry, Australian farm town as it reels from one of the worst droughts in history. I could hear the flies buzzing, see the rabbits eating the last bits of vegetation and smell the despair of the townspeople as they try to hang on to their livelihoods without any rain. I have not experienced this type of magical transportation in a long time. It is perfectly intoxicating.Stay with me, because that is just the setting of the book. Now, add a hardworking federal cop, Aaron Falk, who has relunctantly come back to his hometown for the funeral of his best friend. Aaron Falk is not a perfect hero, he has issues and secrets, but he tries to do right by his friends and he knows something is wrong here. Aaron's childhood friend, Luke, has been accused of murdering his own family before turning the gun on himself. Aaron and Luke shared a secret many years ago which we learn of during the investigation of the family murder. Does this old secret have anything to do with Luke killing his family? Aaron Falk is a tough nut to crack. The author shares just enough about him to make you want more. He is interesting, smart. A loner, a good guy, but what makes him tick? Oh, I'm a devoted fan. I will follow Aaron Falk through every one of his next books, even if there are fifty more to come. Is this a character or plot driven mystery? BOTH! Plus, that Aussie setting! It is so real, you better keep your chapstick handy for the parched lips you develop while reading. Sidenote: As I was reading THE DRY, Oregon's beloved Columbia Gorge was on fire for weeks (still is). Portland was enveloped in smoke, ash and heat! So hard to breathe! My own atmospheric reality definitely contributed to the transforming ability the book had on me- haha. Not to diminish this captivating story in any way.

This is my kind of mystery/thriller!When Aaron returns to his hometown to attend the funeral of his childhood friend, Luke, he intends to make a retreat back to his life as a federal agent, as quickly as possible. But, Luke\u2019s grieving parents ask him to use his talents to look into Luke\u2019s financial affairs, in hopes of finding answers as to why their son killed his wife and son and then shot himself. The chances are slim to none that Aaron would find anything to ease their pain, but he feels he owes them a favor, so he agrees to stick around a few more days. Before long, Aaron finds himself partnered up with a local investigator in an all-out search for clues that would shed light on the events leading up to the murder/ suicide. In the process, they uncover startling evidence that will change everything they thought they knew. The Australian location, in a town suffering through a severe drought, where the heat is nearly unbearable, has the entire town unusually edgy, which paints a combustible atmosphere riddled with irritable tension from start to finish. The shocking murder/ suicide is a compelling mystery full of unexpected revelations and surprising twists, but the secondary thread that takes up equal space in the novel, is a haunting cold case story centered around the death of a friend of Luke\u2019s and Aaron\u2019s back in their youth. Aaron and his father were both suspects in the girl\u2019s death, and left town under a cloud of suspicion. Can Aaron find out what really happened after all this time? Dual storylines can be tricky, but both stories weave between the past and present with amazing fluidity. The story is bleak, almost gloomy at times, with little or no relief along the way, but the characterizations are so vivid and the story so taut, the heaviness became an asset and is part of what made the story so absorbing and moody, along with all the hidden small town motives, suspicions and secrets that came roiling to surface. While the subject matter may not be for the faint of heart, with such dark and emotional themes at play, the story has practically everything fans of this genre could ask for. It\u2019s a police procedural in some ways, a twisty psychological thriller in others, with strong suspense and thriller elements added into the mix for good measure. The exceptional writing provides a wealth of depth, which sets this one apart from the typical mystery thriller. I am tingling with anticipation for the next book in this series!

The original name, El Ni\u00f1o de Navidad, traces its origin centuries back to Peruvian fisherman, Who named the weather phenomenon in reference to the newborn Christ. \"The Dry\", itself refers to the long standing drought .....The afternoon heat was a scorcher. No rain meant no feed. \"And no feed made for difficult decisions as the tiny-town shimmered under day after day of burning blue sky\".  THIS NOVEL is as WONDERFUL as everyone is saying with MARVELOUS CHARACTERS--that makes this book so darn GOOD!!!  \"First on the scene, the flies swarmed contently in the heat as the blood pooled black over the tiles and carpet. Outside, washing hung still on the rotary line, bone dry and stiff from the sun. A child's scooter lay abandoned on the stepping-stone path. Just one human heart beat within a kilometer radius of the farm\".  \"So nothing reacted when, deep inside the house, the baby started crying\". Aaron Falk....takes center stage in this story. He returns to his hometown-Kiewarra after having been away twenty years to attend the funeral of his old childhood friend, Luke Hadler. Aaron and his father left town years ago - after it was implied that Aaron had a role in the death of a young girl named Ellie Deacon. Aaron is now a Federal investigator of financial crimes-- and Luke's parents, Gerry and Barb Hadler, ask Aaron to stay in town after Luke's funeral to investigate the truth. Aaron says - he's not a murder investigator.... but Luke's parents said, \"we've come to you. You're the police\". Aron insists that he doesn't do that type of work anymore that he's on the financial side dealing with money. Barb thinks money may have played a part of it besides....Aaron knew Luke better than any of the town police. They are hoping Aaron will clear his name...... and find out what really happened for the death of his wife Karen and their little boy Billy. And even the facts around the baby - Charlotte.... who was found alive in the house of a murder scene. We have two storylines:  1. The present family murder case of Luke, Karen, and Billy. 2. The past death of Ellie Deacon. Ellie was friends with both Luke and Aaron as teenagers. The only truth we know early in this story is that BOTH Aaron and Luke lied the night of Ellie's death. Ellie was found dead in the river with rocks in her pockets -- so did she commit suicide or did somebody kill her? And why did Luke and Aaron both lie that night? Many questions run through the readers mind as the story unfolds in this tightly constructed lyrical novel. For me ---One of the biggest pleasures was the conversational voices among the characters. I understand there is going going to be a follow-up story.......which leaves me questions about the ending of this book.... and looking forward to meeting Aaron Falk again.

It\u2019s set in the swelter of the Outback in middle of the worst drought to hit Australia in a century. Yet I didn\u2019t get any real sense of the suffocating heat, nor do I remember flies being swatted from any number of sweaty faces.2) Aaron Falk is in town and just happens to be on the financial intelligence side of criminal investigation (how very convenient for the purpose of the story). 3) The dialogue was unconvincing. I mean, don\u2019t rough, tough, leather-necked Aussie men in the middle of the Outback ever use the f-word?

Australia has been hit with one of its worst droughts ever, turning fertile lands into blobs of brown. In the community of Kiewarra, rain has not fallen in upwards of two years, only adding to tensions. An emergency call is made and authorities arrive at the Hadler farm to find a bloodbath. Luke Hadler appears to have killed his wife and son, before turning the gun on himself. The town chalks this up to extreme duress and a cloud of murder-suicide hangs over the town, which accompanies the scorching sun. When Aaron Falk returns to his hometown to attend the funeral of his childhood best friend, townsfolk whisper. Falk is forced to remember what happened two decades before, when a friend, Ellie Deacon, was found dead in the river and a note addressed to him turned up. His alibi is flimsy and turns out to have been concocted with the help of Luke, though they thought the secret would prove impenetrable. While Falk has made a name for himself in the Federal Police, he remains that teenager whose name was bandied around as having been responsible. Falk faces those awkward memories as he tries to better understand what could have pushed Luke to kill his family, with whom he was apparently very proud when last they chatted. Falk works with some of the local authorities to investigate the deaths, turning up small inconsistencies. Could someone have harboured animosity for twenty years and finally sought revenge for Ellie's untimely death? Could Falk be next on the list? Working to uncover what might have happened on the Hadler farm, Falk must clear his friend's name, while standing firm as the past rears its ugly head. A wonderful first novel that allows Harper to show that she is someone to be taken seriously in the genre. Perfect for mystery fans and those looking for a superior story to enthral and entertain.Harper has made a wonderful first impression on me with this novel, developing a strong police procedural alongside the complexities of small-town Australia. Aaron Falk serves as a wonderful protagonist as he keeps the narrative moving forward with his investigative skills, though the darker past that he has been forced to revisit keeps readers wondering about this man until the final sentence. This hint at a less than pristine Falk allows Harper to introduce a number of other characters whose importance varies, while pushing the narrative forward. Kiewarra proves also to be effective as a setting, as it mixes that proximity to big city life with the quaint farm living that has become destroyed with the current drought. A community that holds grudges while wanting to envelop its citizens away from prying eyes, Harper uses these traits to further enrich her narrative. Harper's use of flashbacks throughout, rather than straight recounting dialogue, gives the reader a great deal of insight and provides a true 'revelation' perspective throughout the story, as if the reader were witnessing some of the events that had been mentioned in passing. The reader learns much from these glimpses into the past and it provides a telling connection to the larger story. Overall, a wonderful piece that should provide momentum for a series, should that be the route Harper wishes to pursue. Curious readers should not take the title to be indicative of the quality or presentation of the novel, but that stocks at booksellers will disappears as swiftly as an Australian brushfire.

I love it when books which are hyped actually live up to the praise they're getting, and Jane Harper's \nThe Dry\n definitely did.This book had everything\u2014great writing, a terrifically evocative setting (I felt hot every time I read it, and it wasn't just because I'm running a fever, and I kept expecting everyone I came into contact with to speak with an Australian accent), interesting character development, and lots of twists and turns. It's amazing to think that this is Harper's debut novel, because it felt like a book written by a virtuoso.Federal Agent Aaron Falk returns to Kiewarra, the small, rural Australian town where he grew up, when he hears that his childhood best friend, Luke, is dead, along with Luke's wife and young son. Actually his return for Luke's funeral isn't by choice: he's summoned by Luke's father, who threatens to bring to light an old secret that Luke and Aaron shared if he doesn't come home. Years ago, their friend Ellie Deacon drowned, but it turned out she was murdered. Luke and Aaron were each other's alibi that night, although neither really asked where the other one was. Many in the town suspected they lied.\"They'd all been so tight. Teenage tight, where you believe your friends are soul mates and the bonds will last forever.\"Kiewarra has been ravaged by endless drought and the townspeople are on edge, coupled with the tragic circumstances around the deaths of Luke and his family. Given that Aaron and his father fled the town years ago, after both were accused of being involved in Ellie's death, many people in town, including Ellie's ne'er-do-well father and violent cousin, still aren't happy to see him.As much as he wants to get out of Kiewarra as quickly as he arrived, Aaron promises Luke's parents that he will look into what really happened the day Luke and his family died. Partnering with a local police officer, Aaron tries to make sense of who could have been involved, and they both quickly find more than their share of secrets and lies, and Aaron must come face-to-face with an unending supply of childhood memories, some good, some bad. But the more they dig into the crime, the more they uncover, and the more hostile the townspeople become.Is this crime related to the lie that Luke and Aaron told all those years ago, or was something else afoot? Are those still trying to cause people to suspect Aaron's involvement in Ellie's death actually involved in Luke's? Did the drought so destroy this town and any sense of hope that someone felt compelled to murder, or did Luke just snap under pressure one day, like so many believe? These are questions Aaron and his police partner need to find answers to, but will danger find them first?The truth is, a lot of times I'm hesitant to read crime or mystery novels where you actually have to figure out who the perpetrator is, mainly because I feel this way:\n\n\nHarper really did her best to keep you guessing, although that didn't stop me from suspecting nearly everyone at one point. \"Wait, you seem sympathetic? You did it,\" I thought. But while I wasn't completely surprised by the way she resolved the story, I still was surprised at the motivation behind it until the very end. And there was one revelation about the second mystery that baffled me, so I'm going to need to reach out to someone else who has read the book to see if I understood the plot correctly.All told, this is a tremendously suspenseful, exceptionally well-written book that really blew me away. Lately I've been reading crime novels that have been more novel than crime, which hasn't been a bad thing, but \nThe Dry\n was really a crime novel.

Luke Hadler allegedly killed his wife Karen and young son Billy before turning the gun on himself, but is this tragedy as cut and dried as it appears?Federal Police Investigator Aaron Falk returns for the funeral of his childhood friend Luke, but he faces animosity and threats regarding the suicide of Ellie Deacon some twenty years ago. Ellie was a friend of Aaron and Luke, but there were rumours that the teenage boys were complicit in her death.Luke's mother pleads with Aaron to investigate this more recent tragedy as she believes Luke was innocent and that someone else carried out the murders. Aaron joins forces with local cop Sergeant Raco, and so begins this riveting and complex investigation.Kiewarra is a small community where memories are long and grudges even longer. The characters serve the story well, the plot is compelling, and the fact that the community is suffering a drought of epic proportions only adds to the simmering tensions already in place. I can unreservedly recommend this excellent debut novel.*Thank you to Netgalley, Little, Brown, and Jane Harper for my ARC in exchange for an honest and unbiased review*"}, {"userName": "Luffy", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7407364-luffy", "userReview": "I sigh with relief when I realize I've read a 5 star book at last.

The book is utterly addictive, and I found it hard to take a break from it, reading it within a couple of days. Jane has managed to create realistic characters, dealing with very realistic situations. You often feel that you are standing in Aaron Falk\u2019s shoes, as you start to feel his emotions moving through your body. My favorite part about this book was how everyone was a suspect. When I had finally settled on a killer, I would have to change my mind, chapters later, and did so throughout the book. Then, when I had discovered who it was, I was shocked at the reasoning behind the murders. I couldn't believe that this was the author's debut novel. I am so happy that this is a series.It is set in the fictional town of Kiewarra several hours drive from Melbourne. It is a hot, dry prolonged spell and the people are getting antsy as the heat roils around the dusty roads. Things are dying\u2026 and people are too.When a farmer and his family are found shot dead, the community readily accepts that hopelessness and desperation have caused the father, Luke Hadler, to murder his wife and son and leaves his thirteen month daughter alive, before turning the gun on himself. His childhood friend, Aaron Falk, returns to Kiewarra to attend the funeral. Luke\u2019s parents beg Aaron, a federal agent with the Financial Intelligence Unit in Melbourne, to look into Luke\u2019s finances to see if things were really so dire that he committed murder-suicide. It doesn\u2019t take long for Aaron to think things may not be what they seem and, with the help of the local police sergeant, Greg Raco, he begins to investigate the circumstances surrounding the deaths at the Hadler farm. Aaron's return also re-awakens an old mystery from when he was a teenager where his friend Ellie was found dead in the river.This was an easy five star rating for me. I could easily vision everything in my head while writing my review. It definitely met the Wow factor for me. I cannot wait to read book two in the series."}, {"userName": "Norma * Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41400192-norma-traveling-sister", "userReview": "Holy Cow! \u00a0What a wonderful book! \u00a0This book definitely had all my senses on high alert while reading this one! \u00a0The mood, the atmosphere, the setting, the tone, the format\u2026..\"Her goodbye as she left was as dry as the fields.\"THE DRY by JANE HARPER is an absolutely engrossing and compelling whodunit crime mystery / thriller that drew me in right from the very first chapter to the very last page!JANE HARPER delivers a clever, atmospheric, suspenseful, impressive, and very descriptive read here which was well-written and told in tandem from a past mystery and linking events of a family murder in the present. \u00a0What really grabbed my attention with this story was the extremely vivid portrayal of place and time. \u00a0The setting surrounding the dry conditions of this small town in Australia was so vivid that it had me desperately wanting and waiting for the rain to pour!The novel kept me guessing as the mysteries gradually unfolded, although there was nothing real surprising with the reveal it was the way that the author delivered this story that made this book an exceptional read. \u00a0I also really enjoyed Aaron Falk\u2019s character and will wait patiently to read the next book in this series.

He\u2019s spent the years in between trying to forget his childhood years in Kiewarra, the way his family was run out of town. He\u2019s come back, reluctantly, for a funeral for Luke Hadler, the boy who was once his best friend. Luke Handler, his wife, Karen, and his six year-old son, Billy, all gone. Eighteen hours and he\u2019s outta there. It seems everyone in town believes that Luke killed his wife, and his son, and then turned the gun on himself. Only his infant daughter was left untouched.\u201dLuke Handler may have had a light on waiting for him when he came home, but something else from this wretched, desperate community had seeped through that front door and into his home. And it had been rotten and thick and black enough to extinguish that light forever.\u201dFalk has no idea what could have possibly prompted an act like this from Luke, it\u2019s been a long time since the days when they were friends. Luke\u2019s parents are taking care of his infant daughter, but are finding the town seems to be turning against them, turning away their business. They turn to Falk, hoping he can find something to clear Luke\u2019s name. They can\u2019t believe he would have, could have ever done this heinous act. But did they really know their son? Falk thought he did once, but now he\u2019s not as sure.Small towns have some things in common, the talk that lingers for decades, fingers pointed, the certainty that they know what happened lingers long after the time has passed. And the mystery of Ellie Deacon\u2019s death still lingers, fingers still point at Aaron Falk. Weaving in and out of time the way the river of his childhood flowed effortlessly, his memories of the past alternate with the search of the present day. Truth is what he\u2019s after, in both times. Working with Raco, who is with the local police, they examine the case from multiple sides, running into dead ends. For me, the characters that spoke to me the most were Ellie and Karen, both facing futures which seemed to have no right way to turn, both wanting to share their burdens but unable to share them in time to save them. What I really loved most about this novel the most was the atmosphere, the setting, the mood. So much desperation as the drought goes on, robbing them of their livelihood, no water for crops or livestock and watching everything you\u2019ve worked for your whole life just wither away. What are you if you are a farmer and you can no longer farm your land? Even the children\u2019s moods are affected, watching their animals die, the sky fill with dust and flies.

Aaron Falk, a federal financial police officer, reluctantly returns to Kiewarra to attend the funeral of his former best friend, Luke Hadler. It appears that Luke committed a murder suicide, killing his wife, Karen, and their six-year-old son, Billy, before taking his own life. The community is in shock and speculation abounds. Why would Luke Hadler kill his wife and son? Furthering the mystery is why he left his baby daughter, Charlotte, alive.Falk plans to spend 24 hours in Kiewarra, but Luke\u2019s parents ask him to investigate the family\u2019s financials, hoping that he can uncover something that can add some insight into Luke\u2019s actions.

Maybe I\u2019m using silly water analogies because I\u2019m remembering how parched this locale is, a small farm town in Australia, and I need some liquid. I\u2019m sure that a big part of the allure of this story (about a guy, Falk, who is trying to solve a heinous crime) is its vivid, scorched setting. Everything is hot and dry and slow. I didn\u2019t feel the heat for some reason, but I definitely felt the slow. I so wish I liked it more. It\u2019s way more fun to be in the gush club. There is a small Joy Jar, but it\u2019s tucked away in the corner where I more or less ignore it because the meh is so overwhelming. I will tell you what the Joy Jar holds, of course: The book is well-written, the pace is good, there isn\u2019t fluff, and the atmosphere is vivid. All very good things. But before I lug out the Complaint Board, I will say that part of my reaction is due to two things that have nothing to with the book itself: Over-hype, for one. And second, I\u2019m not crazy about whodunits where it\u2019s a police procedural deal. I don\u2019t dislike them, but it has to be a knock-my-socks-off kind of thing for me to get all busy with a Joy Jar. Complaint Board-Pick up the pace. I\u2019m repeating myself so I apologize, but for me it was slow. It seemed to especially sag in the middle, where I thought too much time was spent on one bad guy. It felt like the record got stuck, and I needed the needle to get unstuck faster. -Plain Jane language and plot. Sigh, I wanted some fire.-Italic flop. The author put the past story as italic entries right in the middle of the present story. This didn\u2019t work for me. At times I expected and wanted it to be a first-person memory, which would have felt more natural. Instead, all of the sudden a third-person narrative about the past rudely interrupted the story, and it seemed intrusive and clumsy.-Stereotypes are a drag. The good guys were too good, the bad guys too bad. -Dull characters are a drag too. It appears that Falk, the main character, will live on in future novels. Sorry, he just seemed dull to me. And the rest of the crew made me snooze too. I didn\u2019t feel connected to any of the characters. -If it\u2019s a small town, I\u2019m a pain in the ass. I get claustrophobic, bored, and rebellious in small towns. Writers who set their stories in small towns have to work harder to please me: There must be exceptional language or characters, or the emotions must be palpable. There must be passion! Not the case here for me.-The criminal came out of left field. The character who committed the crime wasn\u2019t developed enough; they came out of left field. I needed a hint or two so I could have the fun of guessing. This complaint gets an asterisk because it was a biggie for me.-Come on, we all knew that! One character\u2019s situation was too predictable. No biggie, but I get annoyed when there\u2019s a glaring truth that is revealed as a big surprise at the end.-Shaky hands. This is so minor, it\u2019s embarrassing. Twice in one chapter, a character noticed that someone\u2019s hands were shaking. I just never believe that a person\u2019s hands shake when they are upset, unless they are doing something like walking on the ledge of a tall building or stepping on a hissing rattlesnake\u2014some life-or-death situation.The moral of the story: Lower my expectations.

Shanahan reads slowly and deliberately. At first this was driving me crazy, so much so that I tried to find a program to jack the speed for my mp3 player. The more I listened the more I felt Shanahan\u2019s pacing was just right fitting the mood of this murder story. Also, it was a pleasure to hear Shanahan\u2019s accent, greatly enhancing the read. He definitely made the telling his own including subtle nuances. With alternate timelines, the audio could have been confusing but it was easy to distinguish when time frames were switched as the author changes the main character Aaron Falk from Aaron in the past to Falk in the present. The audio edition is an Earphones Winner awarded by Audiofile Magazine so I\u2019m not the only one who thought it a worthy production. I switched to reading the physical book as somehow my audio recording was flawed, the tracks became mixed up and I was at a loss to where I was. No way was I waiting to come up in the audio queue again so I picked up the book. The Dry delivered on most of my expectations. It was a fine debut with a plausible plot, interesting characters, good writing and a satisfying ending. Harper describes The Dry of the title in all its misery, this lack of nourishing water caused by a two year drought resulting in disastrous and devastating living. Dying crops, killing of animals, financial hard times and more, all are taking its toll on the residents of Kiewarra.

Now a policeman in Melbourne, Aaron Falk is home for the funeral of his long \u2013ago friend, Luke Hadler, his wife and young son, all found dead, two murders, one suicide. \u201dAt least the blowflies were happy. The finds that day were unusual, though. Smaller and with a smoothness to the flesh. Not that it mattered. They were the same where it counted. The glassy eyes. The wet wounds. The body in the clearing was the freshest. It took the flies slightly longer to discover the two in the farmhouse, despite the front door swinging open like an invitation.Can you return home? Do you even want to?

His former best mate, Aaron Falk, is now a Melbourne cop, and he has been summoned by Luke\u2019s father with a letter saying: \n\u201cLuke lied. You lied. Be at the funeral.\u201d\nGrowing up, his own family life was lousy, and the Hadlers\u2019 place felt like home, so of course he goes to the funeral. He\u2019s also fearful of what the accusation of lying might mean.In high school, Luke, Aaron, and Ellie had run around together as a group, as kids do, swimming in the river, and when the amusing, effervescent Gretchen (\n\u201cthe human equivalent of bubble bath\u201d,\n says Ellie) joined them, they began to pair off. Luke was always the charismatic leader, Aaron was the more aware, sensitive to moods.Then there was an incident at the river, and while the boys swore they were together, shooting rabbits somewhere else, they have no proof. Rumours point to Aaron, and he and his father are run out of town.\n\u201cThe rumours were fed well by Ellie\u2019s father, Mal Deacon, and grew fat and solid. They sprouted legs and heads and they never died.\u201d\nNow, Aaron\u2019s counting down the hours until he can leave again. One night, in a room over the pub, and that\u2019s it \u2013 back to the city. Till then, he\u2019s got to make it through the funeral of his mate, the mate\u2019s wife he never met, and the little boy in the tiny, heart-breaking coffin. Then the wake with Luke\u2019s parents and Luke's surviving baby, where the bubbly Gretchen greets him unexpectedly with a big hug and a little boy. When Luke\u2019s mum asks the friends to try to remember how her son loved his family, a local loudmouth pipes up with \n\u201cYeah, \u2018til he butchered them.\u201d\nGrant Dow was \n\u201c. . . a large man wearing his mid-forties badly. Fleshy biceps that were more fat than muscle strained against his t-shirt as he folded his arms. His face was ruddy, with a scruffy beard and the defiant look of a bully. He stared down each person who tried to chastise him, until one by one they looked away.\u201d\nHarper\u2019s characters are real people \u2013 I\u2019ve seen countless blokes like this at livestock sales. Every one of these men and women could be innocent, complicit, or guilty, and we wonder if Aaron will stick around long enough to help the local copper unravel not only this tragedy, but clear his name from the one twenty years ago.Fantastic story in a setting where I recognise every fly, every paddock, every cloud of dust and crackle of leaves.\n\u201cIt was paved, but not well. Deep cracks showed where the bitumen had swelled and shrunk with the seasonality of a crop.\u201d. . . \u201cThe huge river was nothing more than a dusty scar in the land. The empty bed stretched long and barren in either direction, its serpentine curves tracing the path where the water had flowed. The hollow that had been carved over centuries was now a cracked patchwork of rocks and crabgrass. Along the banks, gnarled grey tree roots were exposed like cobwebs.It was appalling.\u201d\nAs for finding evidence and clues:\n\u201c. . . the bushland sprawled dense and heavy. it seemed to shiver in the heat. It gave nothing away. . . \u2018Going to be some bloody hunt, . . . best hiding place in the world out there.\u2019 \u201d\nHarper writes in the present, but as memories are triggered, she introduces excerpts from twenty years ago in italics, making it very easy not only to follow, but to remember what characters already know as they are trying to make sense of new situations. I\u2019ve seldom seen it so well done.The pub, the town, the cop shop, the milk bar, the school \u2013 they are all very real \u2013 as of course are the dust and heat that no amount of air conditioning can dispel.Absolutely fantastic! And I haven\u2019t even mentioned how intricately she wove, then unravelled, the mysterious threads so that we\u2019re never quite sure who is lying or just mistaken, who is trustworthy, who is just hoping for the best.Remarkable book and impossible to believe it\u2019s her first! Thanks to NetGalley and Little Brown for the preview copy from which I\u2019ve quoted."}, {"userName": "Ginger", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14097149-ginger", "userReview": "I went into this book knowing the hype was high and many of my Goodreads friends loved it. I was hoping to temper my expectations but I shouldn\u2019t have been worried. This was an excellent book my friends!I can\u2019t believe this is Jane Harper\u2019s debut novel. I\u2019m impressed by her writing and storytelling. The Dry was gripping from the beginning to the end. No joke.The book starts with Aaron Falk coming back home for the funeral of Luke Hadler. Aaron is a federal investigator living in Melbourne and wants nothing to do with the small town of Kiewarra. Luke Hadler is suspected of killing his family and then committing suicide. Luke was one of his oldest friends growing up so he makes an exception on coming back to Kiewarra for the funeral. One of the reasons Aaron wants nothing to do with Kiewarra is a childhood friend died when he was young and most of the town blames him or thinks he's guilty of the death.So, we\u2019ve got a few story lines going on in this book:1. The murder/suicide of Luke, Karen and Billy (youngest son)2. The death of Ellie Deacon when Aaron was a teenager.And both story lines are fantastic and gripping. The small town of Kiewarra was an excellent setting and how judgmental a community can be. The town is also going through a drought so emotions and tension are high. The character development was great and this was a well written book!I\u2019m so excited for the next book in the series. I loved the characters, plot and overall mystery of both story lines.Kudos to Jane Harper on adding another excellent series to my reading schedule!"}], "description": "A small town hides big secrets in this atmospheric, page-turning debut mystery by an award-winning new author.After getting a note demanding his presence, Federal Agent Aaron Falk arrives in his hometown for the first time in decades to attend the funeral of his best friend, Luke. Twenty years ago when Falk was accused of murder, Luke was his alibi. Falk and his father fled under a cloud of suspicion, saved from prosecution only because of Luke\u2019s steadfast claim that the boys had been together at the time of the crime. But now more than one person knows they didn\u2019t tell the truth back then, and Luke is dead.Amid the worst drought in a century, Falk and the local detective question what really happened to Luke. As Falk reluctantly investigates to see if there\u2019s more to Luke\u2019s death than there seems to be, long-buried mysteries resurface, as do the lies that have haunted them. And Falk will find that small towns have always hidden big secrets.", "title": "The Dry\n      \n          (Aaron Falk #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28220971-the-dry", "average": 4.05, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485339399l/28220971.jpg", "reviews": 7745, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/556546.Jane_Harper", "name": "Jane Harper"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Thriller", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28220971-the-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35697187-the-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27824826-the-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28935749-the-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29906581-the-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27297286-the-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34853656-the-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34275222-force-of-nature", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32754069-the-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39863488-the-lost-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31435501-saveozstories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37581710-the-company-of-demons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40024832-empire-of-sin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8343548-the-bricklayer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193155-among-the-wicked", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23818400-the-snow-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23157833-almost-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33555347-crime-scene", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30249521-fatal-frost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266676-remains-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34330657-finding-claire-fletcher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28824403-outfoxed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23957469-huntress-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204087-the-deepest-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35115882-what-the-dead-know", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40267317-ragdoll", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39791173-the-girl-before", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205081-last-witness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205040-dead-weight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18903409-weekend-warriors", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193809-eye-for-an-eye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27239265-the-short-drop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623604-you-only-live-twice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377392-thunderball", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17284593-casino-royale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623578-for-your-eyes-only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193858-the-cuckoo-s-calling", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17304110-live-and-let-die", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18780375-dr-no", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17379070-moonraker", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18799804-diamonds-are-forever", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205231-the-spy-who-loved-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377384-from-russia-with-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243961-the-cape-refuge-collection"]}
