The little boy is Rastafarian so the act of cutting his hair brims with so much more meaning. The act brings with it implicit dismissiveness, disrespect, entitlement, the politics of skin color, resentment and a whole lot of other things. The book goes into detail regarding why the teacher did it and what went on in his general make up that allowed him to think this would be acceptable. What goes on in the culture that helped him develop his attitudes. The fact that the teacher was dark skinned and educated worked in crossed purposes because he felt both entitled by his education and yet felt tremendous self-loathing because of his skin color and the skin color of the boy (who is half white). The act of cutting the hair had major reverberations throughout the community with major religious undertones associated with hair as well as the attempted subjugation of the boy simply because he was Rasta and lived in poverty. The act dripped with disrespect for the boy, his parents, his religion etc. Kaia's roots also have importance. He was born out of wedlock to a very smart, promising young girl. Her pregnancy ended her opportunities at higher education and a better life. Kaia was born out of love between her and a young white man who happened to be the son of the principal at his school. The principal is a liberal minded white lady who doesn't know that she has a grandson. Backgrounds are filled in (to the reader, not the characters), drama ensues and when Kaia's mother finds out what has been done, she stabs the teacher in his eye with scissors. Police track her down and kill her with a detachment that is horrifying. The teacher lives to become the crazy, one-eyed beggar on the streets. This is the bad premonition that Ma Taffy has at the beginning of the book.

Here\u2019s the author, speaking through one of his characters: \u201cLook, this isn\u2019t magic realism. This is not another story about superstitious island people and their primitive beliefs. No. You don\u2019t get off that easy. This is a story about people as real as you are, and as real as I once was before I became a bodiless thing floating up here in the sky.\u201dIntrigued? How could you not be? This book is simply magnificent, a testimony to where the creative mind can take us and an affirmation of why I read. The characters are fresh and original, from the self-named Ma Taffy who was blinded by rats but still sees plenty, to the sniveling and self-important schoolteacher, Mr. Saint-Josephs, who takes it upon himself one day to cut off the dreadlocks of a little boy named Kaia \u2013 a name that literally means \u201chome.\u201dWhy does the act of cutting off dreadlocks matter\u2026and how does it lead to something that Jamaicans call the \u201cautoclaps\u201d\u2026and what we know as \u201ccalamity\u201d? Kei Miller, in prose that soars and captivates, seamlessly weaves in the history of the Rastafarian heritage, particularly that of a charismatic preacher named Alexander Bedward with the ability to levitate. The flying preacherman, as he was called, becomes not just a metaphor but a symbol. As Kei Miller writes, \u201cYou may as well stop to consider a more urgent question; not whether you believe in this story or not, but whether this story is about the kinds of people you have never taken the time to believe in.\u201dTo really understand one\u2019s sense of self, Mr. Miller suggests, you need to have something to believe in. And uncovering what that \u201csomething\u201d is challenging when the people are subjugated, disrespected, and unempowered. Otherwise, the only way to \u201cfly away to Zion\u201d is by dying, and indeed, our narrator (whose identity is only unveiled at the end), has had to suffer that fate. This is a stunning book, picking up the Kingstown patois and combining it with a lyrical poetry. It is so convincingly written, so beautifully rendered, that I cannot imagine it not making my Top Ten list for 2017."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "An inverted gold crown on a jet background graces my cover of Kei Miller\u2019s 2016 novel Augustown and the fiction points to the couple of days in the 20th C when the power structure inverted in a small town in Jamaica. A flying preacher, Alexander Bedward, is instrumental in inspiring the beginnings of the Rastafarian movement in 1920\u2019s Jamaica. That story is wrapped around a more current parallel story of Gina, the clever girl some thought would also fly. \"...the stories bounce against each other like echoes...\" Power and powerlessness entwine in this novel.A town is populated with memorable figures like blind Ma Taffy, gun- and drug-runner Marlon, the dread-headed part-white child Kaia born out of wedlock, the childless spinster Sister Gilzene who could sing an operatic soprano, Rastafarian fruit peddler Clarky, the uptight upright teacher Mr. Saint-Josephs whom we suspect is insane, and a white family: a corporate father with ugly values, his wife learning to ignore him, and a boy who was selfish in the way white people are when they \u2018do not see color.\u2019A bit of a thriller, this novel, because we scent blood early on, with the guns Marlon stashes under Ma Taffy\u2019s house, Clarky dying, and crazy old Bedward rising up like some kind of lunatic second coming going. Oppression surrounds and weighs on us like humidity. \u201cThe rastaman thinks, draw me a map of what you seethen I will draw a map of what you never seeand guess me whose map will be the bigger than whose?Guess me whose map will tell the larger truth?\u201d\u2014from Cartographer Tries to Map a Way to Zion\nOnly after I looked for interviews with Miller did I realize he is considered a poet first, though in descriptions of his education he says he started with prose stories. He is lavishly talented, and writes with an enlightened sexual awareness. This novel has a strong set of female characters and in his 2010 collection of poems called A Light Song of Light, we also get that sense of even ground, and more: Every bed was made illegal by the brushof chest against chest, and by our sweat.--from A Short History of Beds We Have Slept in Together\nMiller saves his challenges for colonialists and from his words we recognize Miller understands rage and sorrow. \"...how they have forced us to live in a world lacking in mermaids--mermaids who understood that they simply were, and did not need permission to exist or to be beautiful. The law concerning mermaids only caused mermaids to pass a law concerning man: that they would never again cross our boundaries of sand; never lift their torsos up from the surf; never again wave at sailors, salt dripping from their curls; would never again enter our dry and stifling world.\"--from The Law Concerning Mermaids\n Historical figures feature in this poetry collection, including Alexander Bedward again, Singerman (Marley?), Nathaniel Morgan, Coolie Duppy, etc. and there is a strong scent of homesickness. Miller has lived in Great Britain for some years now and perhaps is telling the same story over and over, in a new way each time, pruning and training the branches until they remind him of home.In the poetry collection The Cartographer Tries to Map a Way to Zion published in 2014, Miller\u2019s language is English but there appear so many words we have never seen that we are unsteady, unsure, very nearly undone.  UnsettledSo consider an unsettled islandInside\u2014the unflattened and unsugaredfields; inside\u2014a tegaregsprawl of roots and canopies,inside\u2014the tall sentries of blondwoodand yoke-wood and sweet-wood,of dog-wood, of bullet trees so hard they will one day splinter cutlasses,will one day swing low the carcasses of slaves; inside\u2014a crawlingbrawl of vines, unseemlyflowers that blossom from their spines; inside\u2014the leh-guh orchids and labrishinghibiscuses that throw raucoussyllables at crows whose heads are red as annattos; inside\u2014malarial mosquitoesthat rise from stagnant ponds;inside\u2014a green humidity thick as mud;inside\u2014the stinging spurge, the nightshades, the Madame Fates;inside\u2014spiders, gnats and bees, wasps and lice and fleas; inside\u2014the dengue, the hookworm, the heatand botheration; unchecked mackasharp as crucifixion. This is no paradise\u2014not yet\u2014not this unfriendly, untamed island\u2014this unsanitised, unstructured island\u2014this unmannered, unmeasured island;this island: unwritten, unsettled, unmapped.\u2014from Cartographer Tries to Map a Way to Zion\nThe unsettlement one feels when reading the poem is curiously the way Miller makes us feel in his novel, though he does not use such words. We retain a kind of distance. Just as well. There is danger everywhere. The only other place that ever gave me this sense of familiarity and menace was another island with a bloody colonial history, Tasmania.This is a new cultural sphere; it takes some time to accustom to this point-of-view. The language which is at once foreign and familiar, continental and island, melodic and profane, knowing and naive. Hope is not an obvious choice when one is the underclass. Rastafarians have a mighty sense of their closeness to god and ghost. White folk don\u2019t offer the same opportunities. This truth is such a relief after centuries of colonial cant.We can feel the tide, the sun, the heat; we smell the flowers, the sea, the mangoes. Miller\u2019s language in Augustown is easily poetic, not caught in it but casual and natural. The story, Gina\u2019s growing up and standing up, is where we\u2019re focused. And yet\u2026and yet the bleaching light on the sunbaked road and the overhanging flowers thrust their way into the story, embellishing it, making us a little homesick, too. The chapter on autoclaps squeezed the heart and was almost pure poetry. This chapter made the book Kei Miller\u2019s. Any other author may have left that chapter out, and they would have been utterly wrong.We, humans in the world, for centuries in every country, have put men in charge of\u2026everything\u2026our well-being, our safety, our protection. Since barely cognizant, I have always thought that was a lot to lay on one half of the human race. Kei Miller seems to understand this.Extraordinary."}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "I selected this book from the Tournament of Books longlist as a potential dark horse.

She is blind but knows something has gone wrong, because she can smell something, which she can't at that moment identify. Kaia returns home from school and she discovers his dreadlocks have been chopped off by his teacher. From there, Ma Taffy starts telling a story about a flying preacherman who showed up in Augustown when she was younger. This connects to the autoclaps (ie: apocalypse) events that are about to occur. The novel ends up roughly divided into before and after, and it all spirals around Kaia's day at school.

We see attempts of the darkest-skin people to break free spiritually in a culture where skin tone defines class. All of this happens in Augustown, the poor section of Kingston.Ma Taffy has raised three girls and now the child of the last, a six year old boy, Kaia. He is being raised Rastafarian by his mother, Gina, and one day his teacher becomes enraged with his appearance. On his return home, sobbing, Ma Taffy tells him the story of the Flying Preacherman, Master Bedward, whom Ma had seen levitating toward the heavens when she was a child. Ah magical realism vs the power of stories and memory. Miller has much to say about this throughout the book. These people live on their stories which repeat and repeat through generations. Those who attempt to alter or rise above their history seem to risk everything. There is a feeling of darkness behind the words that speaks of brutality, racial and class divides, a long history. Myth and the gift of stories can be a trap to hold one inside this history or a ladder with a way out. I may have to read this again to better understand Miller's views. Miller is a poet as well as a prose writer, and it shows in his work. I recommend this book highly with the caveat that it is not a straightforward, linear novel.

It's a hard combination to pull off, and Miller does it. Lyricism can be used to make ugly things too pretty and bearable but I never felt that Miller walked into this trap--instead, his poetry of expression allowed me to look straight into the story, and to see the humanity and uniqueness of his characters. Augustown also manages to tell a lot of story in a little book--only 250 pages. In these ways I prefer it to Marlon James's bludgeon of a masterpiece, A Brief History of Seven Killings.

And the way he did this made me--an outsider--feel in the end as if this story was mine, like it belongs to me now.I recommend avoiding spoilers.

I can see that Kei Miller is forging his own literary path. In other words, he has his own writing style and I like that!Essentially, I think Augustown is about the \"gap\" in Jamaican society - be it upper vs. lower class, white vs. black, educated vs. uneducated, Babylon vs. Rasta. Augustown is a poor part of town where the blind Ma Taffy lives with her niece Gina and little Kaia. One day Ma Taffy wakes up and smells that something isn't right in the air. Her suspicions are confirmed when Kaia returns home prematurely from school with his dreadlocks cut off by a teacher. Babylon has attacked!The first half of the book is dedicated for the most part to the story of the \"flying preacher man\" (see the biography of Alexander Bedward). At first, I was really intrigued why Miller decided to include this piece of oral history that has such a mythical undertone. But as the story progressed, I realized that Miller wants us to understand the way the underclass in Jamaica thinks, their beliefs and how they make sense of the oppressed reality. We are introduced to a wide set of characters and we see the differences between the two groups. Is it still possible to bridge the gap between them? Towards the last quarter of the book, all the threads are brought together. The story of Gina was a heartbreaking tragedy. Love requires context, and they had none. This leaving, then, was probably for the best. At the very least, Kei Miller addresses this \"gap\" and leaves his readers in contemplation."}, {"userName": "Gumble's Yard", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard", "userReview": "Call it what you will \u2013 \u201chistory\u201d, or just another \u201cold-time story\u201d \u2013 there really was a time in Jamaica, 1920 to be precise when a great thing was about to happen but did not happen. Though people across the length and breadth of the island believed it was going to happen, though they desperately needed it to happen, it did not. But the story as it is recorded and as it is whispered today is only one version. It is the story as told \u2026. by journalist, by governors, by people who sat on wide verandas overlooking the city, by people who were determined that the great thing should not happen. \nThis book resembles the Booker prize winning \u201cA History of Seven Killings\u201d in a number of ways which go beyond just its Jamaican setting: a Jamaican born author now teaching creative writing at an Anglo-University; part fiction/part historical, set across many decades; based around a key figure in both Jamaican history and in the Rastafarian movement; ; blending Jamaican patios into the text; examining the interactions between the Island\u2019s black population, its gangs, its rulers and the forces of Babylon. This book covers two different historical periods: Firstly: the early 1920s and the rise and fall (in the literal as well as figurative sense) of the charismatic revivalist preacher Alexander Bedward and his clash with the white political and business establishment. This Paris Review article gives particularly useful background to Bedward and to the \u201cgreat thing\u201d mentioned in the opening quote of my review (albeit one which, despite its sympathy to its subject, could be said to represent the \u201conly one version\u201d described in the quote: https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2...Secondly: some 60 years later in the early 1980s when a dramatic incident (a stressed teacher hugely over-reacting to perceived insolence from a 6 year old from a Rastafarian family, and cutting off his dreadlocks) unleashes dramatic consequences (*) on the some of those who witnessed the 1920s incidents (and their families).(*) or as it is known in Jamaican patios, the autoclaps \u2013 later defined in the book (after a discursion into etymology) as \u201cAutoclaps: the collapse of the heart; a small apocalypse; the afterclap\u201c(http://www.dictionary.com/browse/afte...)The book is told by a (more than usual) omniscient narrator who directly intervenes in the story to address the reader, to give historical context or to provide interpretation of what happened in both stories \u2013 only as the book ends do we discover the identity of the narrator, their own role in the 1980s story and the link between their own fate and that of Bedward in the 1920s story - a fate which in this telling challenges the \u201cone version\u201d and challenges the reader\u2019s own prejudice.\nLook, this isn\u2019t magic realism. This is not another story about superstitious island people and their primitive island people and their primitive beliefs. No. You don\u2019t get off that easy.

I remain in afterglow a month after finishing this book.The story, the feel of the book, and the gorgeous writing swept me into another world. There are so many layers of meaning, of revealing. I greatly admire poets who write novels because those books then become infused with poetry; it almost seems inevitable. I relish the beautiful language here. And there's poetry in the created atmosphere as well. The pacing and the lived world all have that quality.Several favorite quotes:Ma Taffy paused and swallowed, and then the shadow of the unsaid thing grew thicker and darker.Ma Taffy hadn\u2019t waked for a minute before the retort of the Glock seemed to suck all the silence out of the world. She felt the sound in every wrinkle of her face, and then felt it in her chest. She stopped where she was.She has to give Soft-Paw credit, though, for when he walks into the yard at night he, as usual, never makes a sound. It is as if the earth\u2014every blade of grass, every stone\u2014adjusts itself to make space for him, for the specific shape of his body, so that he walks without ever disturbing things. But if his feet never shift things on the ground, his presence shifts something in the air and Ma Taffy knows when he is around.And it is one of the things Augustown will remember about this day: how the gunman, Soft-Paw, had walked back down the lane lugging two rucksacks, how the shapes of handguns and machine rifles were clear through the canvas of those two bags, and how they had all caught their breath upon seeing this. The guns were in the bags but people still squinted at the shininess of them, and if felt afterwards that the shape of those guns became the shape of the entire day.He knows that this terror is connected to the thing he did earlier, so instinctively he goes over the whole drama in as much detail as he can remember. It is therefore not the incident itself that is tiring, but this constant reliving of it, and his absolute inability to leave the scene.He is not an unattractive man, and yet he carries himself in an unattractive way. So strong and so desperate is his belief that he is other than what he actually is, that he moves his body in awkward ways, squeezes it into the wrong clothes, gives it gestures and mannerisms and styles that he probably images are graceful but which come across as clumsy and buffoonish.But always there was this divide between the stories that were written and stories that were spoken\u2014stories that smelt of snow and faraway places, and stories that had the smell of their own breath.From the beginning, something unspeakable had passed between them\u2014an intensity of feeling\u2014but the two believed in talk even less than they believed in love, which only made things worse. Unspoken, the thing between them could not dissipate. It only grew.The word lingers in the air. They all seem to contemplate it. Life, of course, is often shaped by such things\u2014the word that is not only said, but that lingers; the sentence that is not only spoken, but pronounced\u2014these syllables that stick in the air until everyone feels their stickiness, these syllables that grow out from a mere utterance into something tangible\u2026And yet it is also true that from the time of flying preacherman to now, Augustown has become a place that fully expects the extraordinary. Everyday day they wait on it, when it comes they greet it with what might seem to undiscerning eye to be the same amount of indifference with which they greet the ordinary. And indeed it is indifference, but of a different kind, their bodies relaxing into the new events as it this, at last, is the life they have always been meant to live.When the initial excitement evaporates, it is replaced by something even stronger\u2014a sense of awe. The bobo shantis are not making a sound. No chanting, no singing, no nothing. There is something in this solemnity that humbles everyone, something beautiful and terrifying.Yet they continue, with an almost Sisyphean resolve. They have decided that if they cannot accomplish a mile, then maybe they can accomplish a yard or even an inch. If they cannot accomplish the destination, then at least they will pull closer, closer with every opportunity that presents itself. They will inch slowly towards this elusive place\u2014step by step, lickle by lickle.And they then hear it: another voice, right alongside the drumbeat, but even louder. This new voice is coming from somewhere else, somewhere at once close and much further away. From a house close by, but also from the past. It is a beautiful soprano, almost birdlike, but it swells\u2026It's funny, isn\u2019t it, this whole process\u2014how various dialects bleed into each other; how every language is a graveyard of languages, how every language is a storehouse of history.He continued hiccupping, but the waaaaing siren had ceased. Already he was falling into the silence he would never escape from, which is not to say that he became mute. Rather, he was folding himself into himself. He was learning how to become withdrawn and surly. He was learning how to be defeated. And once learnt, it was a lesson Kaia would find impossible to unlearn.Without knowing it, Gina had taught her aunt how to be silent and how to reach into the minds of others. Ma Taffy now knew how to discern Gina\u2019s presence, and so she taught herself how to discern the presence of others. Soon she would teach herself how to discern smells and sounds, even from a distance. She was becoming a woman who could hear and taste and smell what other people could not. It was therefore not the simple act of blindness that made her so alert, so perceptive\u2014it was her relationship with Gina.She had given herself her own Rasta name. She disliked that so many of her people walked around with names like Lisa or Robert or George\u2014names that tried to diminish the greatest part of who they were, of their history; names that weren\u2019t even names, but erasures. She did not know then that tiny moments change wide futures, that small axes fell big trees, that some days have more roads than others and some roads more distance.Consider the crowd\u2014the phenomenon of the \u201ctwelfth man\u201d in English football\u2014the way a crowd can bring out the best in a single player, how they can whoop and cheer their teams on to victory, but how they can also infect a single person with false feeling: anonymity; inherent morality; a reduced sense of responsibility. It is also the crowd that riots, that loots, that lynches\u2014it is the crowd that bays for blood.So although Gina is so much inside her own self, inside her own anger, that she does not acknowledge the crowd, she is still a part of it\u2014she is its epicenter. She feeds on its energy, and the crowd feed on hers. No one here is an individual. Every man and woman is an extension of Gina. Even Bongo Moody, in this moment, is not quite himself, but an angry mother.\u2026there was a sudden quiet that was not a peaceful kind of quiet. No. This was the quiet of old and hungry tigers that knew they still had within themselves the strength to pounce."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32535119-michelle", "userReview": "Wow!

I loved the writing style here\u2026not showy but still poetic, subdued but effective in letting the dialog and events speak for themselves. Also, this is a book which is uniquely set in and about Jamaica and yet the story is ultimately universal in my opinion. Any reader will be able to observe their own version in their own culture. In the opening chapters of Augustown a small boy comes home from school crying to his great aunt, Ma Taffy. Ma Taffy senses unease and as she attempts to work out what happened and what to do about it, she tells the boy the story of the Flying Preacher, the man who before he was brought down by Babylon, gave the inhabitants of Augustown a sense of their true potential. Augustown is heartbreaking and tragic yet utterly compelling and beautifully told.

The events of August 1, 1838, December 31, 1920, and April 11, 1982, are braided together by Miller in fascinating ways. Certainly this is yet another ToB longlisted title that I found superior to 2/3 of this year's shortlisted finalists.I will qualify my praise, however, with the observation that I would prefer to have been allowed to experience the tale(s) without quite so much hand-holding. Every motif, symbol, concordance, and literary echo is underscored and highlighted. Every unusual word is defined. Paying close attention will not benefit the reader here as any plot point or character detail one may have missed will take center stage later and fail to escape notice.Many have likened this book to \"A Brief History of Seven Killings\" and, while the two novels share certain things, that seems unfortunate. \"Augustown\" can't help but suffer by comparison to that much bigger, broader, deeper, more challenging, and - let's be real - superior work. Kei Miller has written a very, very good piece of fiction here that stands up quite well all by itself."}, {"userName": "ns510", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3988627-ns510", "userReview": "4.5 stars.Gorgeous writing, poetic patois, it encapsulates parts of Jamaica's history; from its dark days of colonialism and slavery, to its Rastafarian heritage and oral histories, to its present day inequalities.

From an opening episode where a little boy comes home crying because a teacher has chopped off his dreadlocks, spins a story of poverty, oppression, love and death. That the book is only 220 pages long tells us something about the way the writing works: it's compressed and allusive rather than over-detailed, and Miller has confidence in his readers that we will 'get' what's going on here without the need to spell out connections and messages in any kind of heavy-handed way.The writing is lyrical and pliant (as we would expect from someone who has won the Forward prize) but never 'flowery' or verbose, and the voices emerge beautifully from the text: the dialect of the Jamaican characters vs. the spacially-detached prose of the narrator. And the book is built on a structure of echoes or reverberations that move the personal and now into the realm of the mythic and historical.I had to Google Alexander Bedward and Rastafari to get a steer on the background to the story, but overall this is a hugely accomplished book and one which resists any kind of easy ending. There are some terrible events here but it's certainly not a one-dimensional book. I was left haunted by the story and impressed by the skill of Miller's story-telling."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223374-lisa", "userReview": "PW best fiction of 2017- started audio, returned to audible-having trouble with the accent, need to read, not listen"}, {"userName": "LaR\u00e9us Gangoueus", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49002752-lar-us-gangoueus", "userReview": "C'est un texte \u00e9tonnant, fort qui nous pr\u00e9sente la Jama\u00efque dans sa fragilit\u00e9.

Told intermittently with a typical Jamaican lilt, the language only served to heighten the spellbinding nature of this many layered story . I had such visual images of the characters ,particularly the older generation, passing on stories that had been handed down generation to generation. Miller is an enormously talented author, portraying the story of a wise old blind woman, Ma Taffy, who starts the novel by telling her grandson, Kaia, the story of Alexander Edward, a parish priest who one day was proclaimed to fly to Heaven. In real life, this character did exist but instead was committed to a lunatic asylum. From this kernel, stories evolve with a cast of characters, including the poor hardscrabble town of Augustown, founded by former slaves in real life. There is so much wisdom in the language, as Miller explores the inner dialogues that affects both white and black, rich and poor, oppressed and free..Filled with wonder , this powerful novel should be devoured slowly.."}], "description": "From the winner of the Forward Prize, Augustown is a magical and haunting novel set in the underbelly of Jamaica.Ma Taffy may be blind but she sees everything. So when her great-nephew Kaia comes home from school in tears, what she senses sends a deep fear running through her. While they wait for his mama to come home from work, Ma Taffy recalls the story of the flying preacherman and a great thing that did not happen. A poor suburban sprawl in the Jamaican heartland, Augustown is a place where many things that should happen don\u2019t, and plenty of things that shouldn\u2019t happen do.
