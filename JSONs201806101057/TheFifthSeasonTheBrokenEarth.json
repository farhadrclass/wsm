Jemisin blew me away with her world-building and beautiful writing. It's the tale of an alternate earth called the Stillness, which is plagued by constant seismic activity. This leads to frequent near-extinction events called \"Fifth Seasons\" that keep humans on their toes. The evidence of past civilizations litters the planet -- ruined cities, incomplete 'stonelore' handed down from earlier generations, and strange obelisks that float through the atmosphere like low-altitude satellites and serve no apparent purpose. The civilization that we meet in this book, the Sanze Empire, has survived for centuries by harnessing the power of orogenes -- people born with an innate ability to control their environment. The orogenes can stop earthquakes or start them. They can save cities, or drawn power from living creatures and \"ice\" them. Their powers are terrifying yet essential, so the empire develops a caste of Guardians who have the power to neutralize the orogenes when necessary. The orogenes are held in contempt and called \"roggas\" by ordinary humans. Despite all their power, they cannot control their own lives. They are either hunted down and destroyed or sent to the Fulcrum to be trained and used by the empire. Imagine Hogwarts, if Hogwarts treated its students like chattel. The world Jemisin creates is as horrific as it is brilliant.My advice is to give the book at least fifty pages before passing judgment, because it takes a while to understand what is going on. There is a lot of terminology to get used to, and the book is told in three intertwining narratives that at first don't seem to match up, but once you get into the world and into the story, it is a fantastically rewarding read. I can't say much about the plot without giving away some of the wonderful surprises, but if you want to read about a truly dystopian world that holds a mirror to the darkest of human motivations, this novel will haunt you long after you finish it."}, {"userName": "Cezara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10812008-cezara", "userReview": "Yes, 5 full stars for this one because it's everything I want in a fantasy book. I will explain.I don't read fantasy and sci-fi because I like magic or space ships or laser swords or what have you. I read fantasy and sci-fi because I want to see something new, and there's no other genre that allows this much freedom of imagination, this much flexibility and bending of reality and this much room for \"what ifs\". The genres are ripe with tropes and cliches even so, and I'm at that point where it pains me to have to read again through a story about the noble hearted what's-his-face who saves the land of medieval-Europe-plus-elves-and-dragons with the help of the wise mentor and the pretty princess. Show me something else, something truly weird, I say! And N. K. Jemisin delivered. Let there be a world wracked by earthquakes and volcano eruptions, she says, restless and hostile. Let there be apocalypse-level events every hundred years or so. Let this world be inhabited by people who believe the Earth hates them, who value survival above all else, and have organized their society around making sure some of them will make it through the years of darkness, and famine, and poisonous air and water that follow such geologic disasters. Let there be among them those who have the power to control the earthquakes, to start and stop them at will, and let that society hate them, while doing their best to exploit them at the same time. Let there be another sentient species, strange creatures of stone whose motivations are unknown, who share this world with humans. Then come the the details. The mysterious ruins of the many civilizations that came before this one, some considerably more advanced. Their artifacts endure to this day, their purpose unknown and maybe unknowable now that their makers have been dead for thousands of years. The harshness and ruthlessness of a society living on the brink of extinction, where value is based on usefulness and where, come Seasonal Law, those deemed useless are left to die in the wastelands. The purely utilitarian approach to building in a world where a balcony is unquestionable proof of foolishness or privilege, where decorations are a waste of time and resources since they'll be wiped out in a few years without fail. The surprisingly advanced science, focused - unsurprisingly - on geology, chemistry and physics. The hatred and exploitation of the orogenes, those who have power over the earth itself, by a society that both fears them and desperately needs them if it is to survive. The secrets and the lies and the rewriting of history and the suppression of lore by those who want to keep the orogenes willing slaves. The horrifying abuse, and the inescapable brainwashing, but the training and education too. A system meant to make them more powerful and more powerless at the same time so that it may better make use of them. And then Jemisin pushes further. She goes so far out of the medieval Europe setting that she ends up on the Equator. She makes the other sentient race truly alien, as a different sentience should be, lest you end up with just stranger looking humans. She makes the humans different races, and *gasp* doesn't put the paler one in charge. Just as the characters span the gradients and combinations of human races, they span human sexuality too, from straight to gay with blurry boundaries all over the place. There's love and family and sex, but they're not the kind of relationships you're used to. Why should they be? This is not our world with some magic, mythical creatures, and sword fighting mixed in. This is something else. Something new. And yet, as you read, you get the feeling that this could be our world with some magic and some mythical creatures mixed in. You get the feeling that it was this sort of world at some point, and then something maybe went wrong, and everything had to change, to adapt, and this is the inevitable result. The world is strange, but it's not strangeness for strangeness's sake. It all makes sense, everything fits together, and while you can see that some things could be different, you understand perfectly well why they're not. It's like a gnarled and twisted tree growing on a rocky windswept mountain top. It's not like other trees, but not because someone decided to take an ax to it and make it as different looking as possible. No, once the seed was planted, there simply was no other way it could grow.I can't say more, especially about the characters and the story line, without spoilers, even though I feel I could rant about this book for days on end. Go read it. I can't begin to imagine the level of skill required to create a world so different, and then make it feel so real. N.K. Jemisin deserves your attention."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030788-melanie", "userReview": "This book is beautiful, this book is smart, this book is oh so heartbreaking, and this book is a masterpiece. This is one of those books that make you feel absolutely guilty for giving out five stars to other books. This book is unlike anything I've ever read, but it felt so seamlessly woven. This book mirrors the society we live in today and makes you think about all those uncomfortable topics you'd rather ignore and pretend do not exist. This book has the best representation I've ever read in a SFF novel. This book is deserving of all the hype, all the praise, and every ounce of love it's received. This book easily is now one of my favorite books of all time.\n\n\u201cLet's start with the end of the world, why don\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nThis story is set in a world called the Stillness, where earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other terrible things impacting the earth are constantly happening, but there are people who are able to manipulate the earth to ease them. These people are called orogenes and even though they are continually saving the world they are constantly oppressed slaves. This world has convinced everyone that orogenes are dangerous and need to be controlled at all costs. It is illegal to harbor orogenes and you must turn them in, even if they are your family. The price of hiding a orogene is great and most people are not willing to pay it. If a orogene isn't killed by their community before they are turned in, they are taken to a training school called the Fulcrum where they are deemed worthy enough to train Everyone in the Stillness is trying to survive the world's unforgiving environment. This planet is beyond unstable, because of Fifth Seasons that happens sporadically, but almost wipe out the planet each and every time. The people in this world are scared that a new Fifth Season is about to begin. And just so you understand the severe of the living conditions during a Fifth Season, here are some examples: \u27bdChoking Season - with volcanic eruptions which caused ash that, if it didn't kill you from breathing it in, the lack of sunlight for five years would try to. \u27bdAcid Season - with plus-ten-level earthquakes, which caused many volcanoes that caused the water to become acidic.\u27bdBoiling Season - with hot spot eruptions that began underneath a great lake and made millions of gallons of steam which triggered acidic ran. \u27bdFungus Season - with volcanic eruptions during monsoon season which made for perfect fungal spreading that wiped out major food supplies. These are just a few of the season, and without orogenes this world wouldn't be able to keep a new Fifth Season at bay. This book follows three different girls who are each struggling to survive this horrible world and struggling with their own individual journeys: \u27bdEssun - An older woman whose husband has killed their young son, because he showed that he was a orogene. He inherited his powers from Essun, but they were keeping it hidden from their community. Essun is now off to find her husband who fled after the murder and took their daughter with him. \u27bdDamaya - A small girl who realized she was a orogene after an accidental attack. Her family is isn't willing to pay the price of harboring her, especially since her community now knows what she is. Her parents call the authorities and she is going to be taken to the Fulcrum, where they can train and use orogenes if they are trainable and submissive. \u27bdSyenite - A young woman who has lived the majority of her life at the Fulcrum being trained. At the Fulcrum, as you increase your learning and abilities you will earn rings that signify your power and allows you more privileges. Syenite has four rings, which is impressive in its own way, but she is now assigned to breed with the only ten ring around, so she can give the Fulcrum her child in hopes that it will be very powerful and very trainable. \n\n\u201cOrogeny is damned useful, Syenite is beginning to understand, for far, far more than just quelling shakes.\u201d\n\nYet the side characters are amazing, too. Hoa, Alabaster, Tonkee, Innon, all of them, along side these three women, worked their way into my heart. This whole dystopian world that only wants to kill itself worked its way into my heart. This story is and these characters are truly one of a kind.This book perpetuates so many healthy ideas absolutely seamlessly: \u27bdThis book is unapologetically black and it's something of beauty. \u27bdThis book is about systematic oppression, set in an expertly crafted SFF novel.\u27bdThis book has one of the best polyamorous relationships I've ever read. \u27bdThis book has bisexual and gay representation that was perfection.\u27bdThis book has a wonderful transgender side character who everyone accepts without question.\u27bdThis book even celebrates found families and the importance of finding your own people that will love and accept you unconditionally. \n\n\u201cHome is what you take with you, not what you leave behind.\u201d\n\nThis book creates so many parallels to the world we live in today. This book, hopefully, will make you think about your internalized racism and the prejudices that you hold without even realizing it. The reason so many of us think the way we do today, in 2017, is because our world has told us to think this way without even being given a chance to think differently. This book even has a fictionalized slur for orogenes that made my stomach turn every time I read it. This book is raw and painful at times, so very painful, but it's such an important story. And I'm still unsure if I've ever read anything as sad as the node maintainers in all of my life. The Fifth Season isn't just an amazing SFF novel, it's a parallel to our world today, and I recommend everyone not only read this novel, but to open their eyes while reading this novel. N.K. Jemisin did all this and wrote one of the best SFF stories I've ever read in my life. She deserves every award she won for this masterpiece, if not more. This book is deserving of all the hype, all the praise, and every ounce of love it's received. This book easily is now one of my favorite books of all time and I can't wait to read The Obelisk Gate.\n\n\u201cThis is what you must remember: the ending of one story is just the beginning of another.\u201d\n\nAlso, please go watch the best review of The Fifth Season ever created, by my all time favorite Booktuber, Adriana, from  perpetualpages! Their review brings me to tears every time I watch it, and I hope my review plus theirs will make you pick up this powerful and important book with one of the best stories ever written.

This book is totally out there. There were a few things I didnt like but overall it was pretty amaze balls! This world Jemisin created is like nothing I have read before. I love there are groups of people with powers. The book is dark with sparks of hope here and there. And I still can't get over what happened to Essun's son. That has stuck with me through the whole book. At first I was afraid I wasn't going to understand anything in the book but to my surprise my little brain cells pretty much understood the whole thing. This is the first book I have read by Jemisin and I'm very happy that I enjoyed the book! She can weave a tale, that is for sure. It seems like everyone and their cousin has read this book so I'm not going to write an in depth review, you can go read all of the wonderful ones out there.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, this is an amazing book (oh shit I just did), but I\u2019d like to start this review instead by saying patience is virtue is apt here.\n\n\u201cFor all those that have to fight for the respect that everyone else is given without question.\u201d\n\nThis book and my review will be dedicated to all of you.The Fifth Season, the first book in the Broken Earth trilogy is, in my opinion, a book that will truly require some patience for you to read. It took me around 80 pages to get used to everything in the book and truly start getting invested in it. That\u2019s quite a lot of pages needed, sure there\u2019s a great reason for this but in my opinion sacrificing the first 20%, even if the culmination of it was great. I\u2019m not surprised if a lot of people DNF this book just from the 20%, I almost DNF it myself, it\u2019s also the only reason why this book didn\u2019t receive a full 5 stars rating from me. But trust me; you won\u2019t regret reading this through to the end.Think of a jigsaw puzzle. You start with the big picture, the box or cover of the puzzle. In the case of this book, you started with the passage \u201cThis is the way the world ends for the last time\u201d, but you have no idea how it happens and what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s the catalyst? To process this, it\u2019s really easy, read the book. You\u2019ll probably think at this point \u201cyou don\u2019t say?\u201d but once you started, you\u2019ll probably think of DNFing quickly. Like assembling a jigsaw puzzle, it\u2019s easy to do it, you just need the patience to fit all the pieces. Brandon Sanderson praised Jemisin highly in her writing and storytelling and you know what? He\u2019s right. Jemisin stated that The Broken Earth trilogy is the most challenging books she ever wrote, just from the first book I can already see why. I can\u2019t imagine how much research and planning were done for the creation of this book. I think of the plot of this book as an intricate story that gets better and easier to read the more you progressed, just like how assembling jigsaw puzzle started overwhelming but gets easier and more addictive the more you progressed.Jemisin has also done a stellar job in her characterization. Essun, Damaya, and Syenite have become one of the best written female characters I\u2019ve ever read. Their journey, struggle, background, personality, determination are all written in a way that will make you truly care about them. Picture: Essun by Miranda Meeks (The cover of Fifth Season limited edition by Subterranean Press)Not only that, the side characters here are also unique and equally engaging. For those of you who are begging for diversity in their read, rest assured that you\u2019ll find them here. You want LGBT? Oh, you\u2019ll get it, a lot, with a passage like a \u201ccock rubbing on oily cock\u201d, I don\u2019t think you can ask for more in that aspect. People of color? Brown, black, white, it\u2019s there and they\u2019re all well written.Taking place in a world called The Stillness; Jemisin\u2019s world-building is wonderful, vivid, and atmospheric. Accompanied with a rich history and an intricate magic system called Orogene, which deals with the manipulation of thermal, kinetic energy to address seismic events, almost everything about this book is Earth shatteringly good. One thing to note though, most of the terminologies here isn\u2019t explicitly explained. You have to understand what the names are through the context provided by the narration. If you\u2019re impatient in trying to understand the terminologies, you can just go straight to the back of the book to read the detailed explanation, there\u2019s a whole detailed section there. Before I close my review, I must tell you about the prose here. The way this book is written is a complete culture shock to me, especially Essun\u2019s POV. It\u2019s the first time I read a combination of 2nd POV narrative, done in present tense, and combined with an omniscient element so it took me a while to get into it. Damaya and Syenite\u2019s POV are easier to read as they were done in 3rd person and present tense. It felt odd at first, but after the first 20%, it became so addictive to read. Jemisin\u2019s prose is beautiful and enchanting, and definitely suitable for the story she\u2019s telling here.By the end of this book, I arrived at the conclusion that The Fifth Season is one heck of a start to a trilogy. It\u2019s superb, highly original, and also a fantastic mix of high fantasy and sci-fi that can only be achieved by top-tiered authors. This book has won tons of awards, look them up if you want, there are too many to list here. However, let me tell you that those awards are truly well deserved.You can find this and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at BookNest"}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "[seen semi-confusedly through different names and time periods, from childhood to adulthood to middle age; the last being the present, shown to us through the POV of her shadow in second-person.

Le Guin. I'm not sure if she put that in there or someone else did - but those just happen to be two of my most favorite authors; and yes, I can see the 'influence' on this book.Previously, I've only read Jemisin's Hundred Thousand Kingdoms - her first book. It was good enough that I bought the sequels - but I haven't gotten around to reading them yet. 'The Fifth Season' really demonstrates that her writing has matured since then. The premise itself involves a familiar fantasy scenario (although, technically, this is really \"science-fantasy\"): innate 'magical' abilities that are hated and feared by the local population; an institution devoted to collecting and training talented individuals. There's some Wisdom of the Ancients, some post-apocalypse, some questing, some Wizard Battles. This book will appeal to anyone who loves all of these things. However, the writing and the non-stop originality of the book lift it head-and-shoulders above many other iterations of these tropes.There are three threads of the story. It's nearly immediately clear that they do not all take place concurrently, but it's only gradually revealed how the events of each reflect upon and are related to the others. The unfolding of the tale is done masterfully.In the first strand of this braid, Essun, a mature woman, is introduced by the side of her young son's corpse. It turns out that the boy was revealed to be an orogene. (orogeny [aw-roj-uh-nee, oh-roj-] 1. the process of mountain making or upheaval.) Geologic upheaval is what people born with this ability can do, using only their minds. Unfortunately, it can be a hard ability to control - those with the ability tend to use it unconsciously, whenever they feel threatened or angry. Even a minor offense or accident can end up causing massive death and destruction. So it's understandable that people with this ability are hated and feared. It's also obvious, from nearly page 1, that in a world that is as geologically unstable as this one is, one prone to periodic apocalyptic eruptions that cause years-long, civilization-destroying winters (the 'fifth seasons' of the title), that the orogenes could be the key to survival itself.Essun knows that it was her husband, the boy's father, who killed him. She also knows that the boy's abilities came from her - she also is an orogene. Traumatized and furious, she sets off on a quest for revenge - and to also possibly find her surviving child. But there is one other thing that Essun knows. A recent geologic upheaval was worse than any other in recorded history. It might not yet be clear to everyone, but this could very well be the true end of the world.In the second strand of the braid, we meet the young girl Damaya. She also has just been revealed as an orogene, due to the results of a playground spat. While her family didn't kill her, they immediately repudiate and imprison her - and sell her to a Guardian, who plans to take her to what sounds a lot like a college for wizards, where orogenes will be trained to protect and serve, rather than to destroy.In the third piece of the story, we meet the initiate Syenite, an orogene sworn to the service that we just saw Damaya entering. The obedience required of Syenite, and the responsibilities demanded from her, throw our perspective on the whole institution she serves into quite a different light.And of course... this is just the beginning. There are also aliens! Pirates! Geode cities! Floating obelisks! More!My one slight criticism of the book (and this is me as a non-parent) is there there is quite a lot of dead-child-as-motivation. I'm just generally not a fan of child-motivations in general. But this is done well enough for me to excuse it. The depictions of trauma are realistic and believable; the characters all really came to life for me. There's also a definite sequel on the way... and all I can say is: I can't wait!___March 2016: as promised, nominated for Hugo."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "Really good.N. K. Jemison\u2019s 2016 Hugo Award winner\u2019s world building is as good as Frank Herbert or Ursula LeGuin and with magic rules as well thought out as Brandon Sanderson and with an intimate talent for complex characterization as good as Octavia Butler.All comparisons aside, Jemisin\u2019s work is wildly original and she has created a far future fantasy that provokes thought and entertains. Evoking Jack Vance\u2019s The Dying Earth, this is far, far in the future (if it is even Earth) where some people, Orogenes, have wild earth moving kinetic powers.And there are aliens.In metaphor, Jemisin describes the Orogenes as both imaginatively powerful but also hated and used as slaves. In this way Jemisin uses her impressively intricate narrative to also explore themes of individuality and the One versus the Many. This allegory is especially noteworthy in our post 9/11 world where powerful individuals can affect change as much or more than a sovereign nation. Also interesting was her use of the second person narrative structure in alternating sequences. Really don\u2019t see that much.Jemisin\u2019s intricate use of tectonically powerful super humans, shunned by the rest of mankind, is also a fitting and resonant metaphor for our own responsibilities to our faltering world. The author uses the Orogenes complicated plight to reveal failings in our responsibility to our Mother Earth (interestingly changed to Father Earth in her story).

I honestly tried, without prejudice, and - go figure - failed.

Jemisin more time to work on the sequels. So it was with no small amount of excitement when an advance copy finally made it into my hands. Proof that it was really happening.And oh boy, was it TOTALLY worth the wait.Initially though, my feelings were mixed after the first few chapters. There was that cryptic prologue, with its smattering of information about the world (then right away saying that none of these places or people I just read about actually matter \u2013 wait, what?) as well as the curious narrative style, including one character whose chapters were written entirely in the second person. That choice eventually makes sense, by the way, but at first I really wasn\u2019t sure what to make of the book.But then gradually, everything started to come together. I watched as connections were made, questions were answered, and blank spaces were filled in. The final result was this unique and wholly imaginative novel that delighting me to no end. The world-building elements which so confounded me at the beginning of the book eventually became clear, and I came to recognize the sheer ingenuity behind it.The Fifth Season takes place on a continent known as The Stillness, ironically named given the instability of its geology and tectonics. The world would have fallen to pieces many times over if not for the Orogenes, a group of people with the powers to manipulate earth energies and shape the land. In reality though, The Stillness has actually gone through multiple apocalyptic events called \u201cSeasons\u201d, each one characterized by its specific end-of-the-world effects. It\u2019s the norm for this world, but Orogenes do what they can to make it better, preventing many earthquakes or volcanic eruptions by catching anomalies in time before they can cause widespread destruction.Yet for all that they do for humanity, Orogenes are feared, shunned and subjected to hostility and violent treatment. Their powers can be as unstable and catastrophic as the disasters they try to prevent, especially if the individual cannot learn control. Orogeny is also unpredictable. There\u2019s a genetic predisposition for it, though theoretically anyone can be born an Orogene, so children discovered with the trait are immediately taken away for harsh and rigid training. However, there are also the unfortunate ones that don\u2019t even make it that far before they\u2019re murdered by their scared or panicky neighbors \u2013 or even by their own parents.Essun experienced this in the worst way possible, coming home one day to find the lifeless body of her young son, beaten to death by her husband. An Orogene in hiding, Essun realizes with grief and horror what must have caused the father to kill the boy. Now Essun fears for the life of her daughter whom her husband has kidnapped, and she is determined to go after them. This is her story, a heartbreaking and beautifully written narrative of a woman\u2019s journey taken upon for love and revenge. Jemisin may have created a world here full of mind-blowingly fantastical elements, but she hasn\u2019t left us wanting in the character department either, giving us an emotionally raw, very human tale.I have to say the characters are truly wonderful. The Fifth Season follows three perspectives: Essun, a rogue Orogene whose only quest now is to get her daughter back; little Damaya, taken away by an Orogene handler called a Guardian to Yumenes where she will be trained to control her powers; and Syenite, a young woman paired with a more experienced mentor in order to learn from him and breed with him, ensuring that the next generation will have talented Orogenes to keep The Stillness safe. All three threads are so engaging and poignantly detailed, each one giving the reader a distinct reason to care about these strong yet conflicted characters. It was also wonderful to see the bigger picture they formed in the end.Finally, I have a confession to make. While this is my first Jemisin novel, years ago I actually started to read A Hundred Thousand Kingdoms around the time it came out, but for whatever reason I put it down and didn\u2019t get a chance to pick it up again. I have every intention of going back to the book one of these days, but for obvious reasons I didn\u2019t count it as being \u201cread\u201d. I did, however, feel like I got enough to get a feel for her writing, and now reading The Fifth Season in 2015, I can see how far her skill has come since her debut. With such rich world-building, relatable characters and compelling storytelling, I just knew I had to see all that through to the end, and the conclusion was a real surprise, both marvelous and disquieting.I\u2019m so glad I read this. The Fifth Season is the first novel of The Broken Earth trilogy, and it\u2019s a strong introduction to a brand new world featuring some very fascinating, very special characters. Highly recommended. It\u2019s definitely not going to be an easy wait for the next book."}, {"userName": "J.L.

Jemisin's The Fifth Season offers an original and amazingly immersive experience! Jemisin's world-building exists side by side with a world teetering on the brink of destruction. But this has happened before. Natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanoes have wreaked havoc on the Stillness, the super continent and only land mass of this world. Previous generations/civilizations have been unable to avoid the destruction. The powers (magical abilities) of Orogenes are refined in specific schools and attuned to these natural disasters. They might not be able to prevent the world from ending. (Or maybe they can?) Still, in a society with radically different customs, beliefs and social structures, Jemisin's characters (specifically her strong heroines) stand out and make this a truly enjoyable read!

But this is the way the world ends. This is the way the world ends. This is the way the world ends. For the last time.\u201d \n\nThis was pretty different. It there is such a thing as dystopian fantasy then this is that. Not only are you on a world where there are the regular humans and lands and society. But there are also people whose magic actually moves the earth. They can stop earthquakes or make them. They can dissipate a magma bubble or make a volcano blow its top. It is the first time that I\u2019ve seen this type of power in a book and I really liked how it was used.One of the other bright points of this book was the way it was told. There are three different PoVs and while I guessed pretty early how they were related to one another I enjoyed how author slowly revealed this world. It was interesting to see the story from the different perspectives; a girl just discovered to have power, a woman in the Fulcrum trying to achieve an upper place in that society and a woman hiding her power and trying to live a normal life. Each gave a very specific insight into the world and the motivations of the people in it.\n\u201cneither myths nor mysteries can hold a candle to the most infinitesimal spark of hope.\u201d\nI enjoyed different parts of all of the PoVs but I think that my favorite was Syenite\u2019s. She is a Four Ring Orogene who aspires to get another ring. Most of her life has been spent at the Fulcrum in study perfecting how to move the earth and make it do various things for her. She has aspirations to get another ring but to do that she will need to travel with a 10-ringed Orogene clear some coral from the harbor. At least that is the official reason they are thrown together. The unofficial reason is that Syenite is supposed to have a child with him. Alabaster is not what she was expecting and it seems that he has view of the Fulcrum that is not what she was expecting and it pushes the boundaries of everything she thought she knew about the world and her life.\n\u201cThis is why she hates Alabaster: not because he is more powerful, not even because he is crazy, but because he refuses to allow her any of the polite fictions and unspoken truths that have kept her comfortable, and safe, for years.\u201d\n The story of the woman in hiding just trying to live a normal life was probably my second favorite PoV because when the end of the world comes and she sets off from the community she has been hiding in for years she picks up a very interesting traveling companion. Hoa is a little boy who isn\u2019t exactly what he seems to be. Which is another mystery and facet to the overall world and story arc that was doled out slowly but kept me extremely interested. Every new discovery we make about Hoa led me to think I knew who/what he was and I did kind of but he was still a pretty big surprise in the end.The Fifth Season also touches on genetic manipulation or breeding, slavery, cannibalism and a few other hot topics. Everything in this story felt like it really had a place and wasn\u2019t just thrown in for shock value. It was all a comprehensive part of the story and fit into the overall plot. When Syenite makes a heartbreaking choice I totally understood why she made that choice and maybe if put in that same horrible situation I would have made the same choice. I appreciate that as a reader, since there are many authors out there that like to throw in something horrible just for emotional impact but it doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with the story.N.K. Jemisin has created something that seems truly unique in this world and for that alone I\u2019m really excited. After the revelation at the end I was ready to jump into the next book right away but I\u2019m going to wait a little longer so I can read the 2nd book and then jump directly into the 3rd when it is published next month.Read with some other Fantasy Buffs at"}, {"userName": "Scott  Hitchcock", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50894754-scott-hitchcock", "userReview": "I picked this book up forever ago on a Kindle daily deal for $1.99. I started it a month or so later. About 5 pages in I thought wow I'm really not feeling this I'll come back to it later. A few months pass and I try again, 5 pages and same result. After a few months I setup a group read to get myself to commit to more than 5 pages. So I start the book and after chapter one I'm thinking Holy Crap how is this getting such a great rating? I then read chapter two and it was so awesome. Chapter two was a different character perspective. I started chapter three and it's back to the character from chapter one and I realize why I hated chapter one so much. It's written from the second person present tense. So the writing would be something like \"you enter the room and you see in the corner....\". Trying to put you in the character's body. I thought to myself I'm not going to make it an entire book with that perspective being half of it. It's just too distracting. Then I read the rest of the chapter and it clicks. I totally get why the author made the choice she did. That is a chapter where you have to be soulless not to bleed from the perspective of this character. Such harsh grief that it chokes the air. You have to give this book those three chapters to make your decision and it is a bold one by the author. Not many would take a chance in the fantasy genre with a move like this. It was brilliant and compelling. At first it read like I was getting directions, you take a left and then you pull into the parking lot, but once I got over it I can only say it was brilliant. The world itself and the magic system are so unique and bold as well. Most authors stop at the action of magic. This was so well detailed in a psychological, physical and ethereal sense that you felt it. The author also took bold chances with sexuality and conventional relationships and love. There was a quasi love triangle, and in general I'm so bored of that angle, that redefined the scope. Again brilliant. I'm really looking forward to reading the next two books.

I read a lot of fantasy and obviously love that genre immensely - still, I don't usually give fantasy books five stars but this one definitely deserves every single one of those stars because it is pretty stinking fantastic.The world N. K. Jemisin created is mesmerizing in its casual cruely, both in regards to the planet (that is pretty much out to kill everyone) and in regards to the social structure of the people living on this hostile planet. There are near extinction events happening more or less frequently and the society that evolved in response to this threat is rigid and inhumane. There is a slave caste of  orogenes  who are feared and hated because of their powers and while they are in theory stronger than their oppressors, Jemisin shows how insidious years of slavery are and how it messes with people's heads. This is very much a political book of fantasy and I loved it all the more for that. The world created is so vivid and so infuriating and real that it was amazing to read about it. But the biggest strength of this work is that this political core does not diminish the greatness of the storytelling, Jemisin does not sacrifice her story in favour of the message and the balance she strikes is impressive.The book follows three narratives and all three of them were brilliantly done. The language Jemisin chooses for each of those threads is fitting; even the second person narration works surprisingly well. Her language flows really nicely and even though it sounds like a story told rather than a story read it is almost lyrical in its entirety. The ending was cruel as is befitting for a work this dark and I cannot wait to read the next one; and then everything else N. K. Jemisin has ever written.

A book that requires a 6 star rating. Books that are as beautiful as they are scary, as haunting as they are prophetic happen once in a while to remind me that reading is much more than entertainment or a pleasant pastime; reading is necessity. The Fifth Season is one of these books. How to explain pure genius condensed in the usual triangle of narrative-characters-worldbuilding? Jemisin begins: \"Imagine a land. It is ordinary\". But her mesmerising storytelling, something in between poetry and a sociological study, belies this first admonition. There is nothing ordinary in the Fifth Season: neither the way it is told, nor the story it treasures. Delving into this novel layer after layer is like diving deep into the Earth itself. Initially, we are captivated by the beauty of the outer layer, the \"mountains and plateaus and canyons and river deltas\", only to discover the overwhelming richness of the natural resources pocketed within the protective jacket of rocks, the diamonds of the main characters, the silver dialogue lines, the riches of civilisations upon civilisations and life transcending the species we know and are prepared for. Then, when you think you have probed far enough, the book takes you straight into the hot magma of what is yet to come, the fiery lifeblood of a greater story than you could ever hoped for. This is the essence of Fifth Season. I do not think I can talk about this novel as if it is a normal book and analyse the usual elements. Reading Fifth Season was so profound and intimate experience that I still lack appropriate phrases that could capture the whirlwind of emotions it invoked. The most important thing is that every tiniest detail in the novel is interconnected with everything else: the how is reliant on the where; the where is in symbiosis with the who, the who influences the how and everything together amounts to the why. Although, truth to be told, the abundance of 'big questions' qualifies Fifth Season to be labelled a philosophical treaty in a way akin to Ender's Game.The ingenuity of Jemisin's writing is perhaps the best visible in the fact that she managed to create a world that is inherently unique, not only a mere variation or a poor reflection of the reality or a casual regurgitation of typical sci-fi/fantasy themes. She takes us to a planet of unusual seismic activity, inhabited by species far more fantastic than the usual we expect and so original in sociological and cultural terms that it is as enticing as it is disturbing to learn about the dominant civilisation (imagine your Bible is replaced by a health and safety manual!). Alfred Hitchcock advised that a good movie should start with an earthquake and be followed by rising tension. There is nothing indicating that a great book could not follow the same pattern. As you start gathering the pieces of a puzzle scattered in the initial quake, as you start discovering the patterns and shapes of past and future events, as you grow and break and heal, and shatter again with the main characters, as you turn pages with trembling fingers you discover that the initial tremors were only a prelude. There is more to come and I cannot wait to read The Obelisk Gate.PS If you liked the Broken Earth Trilogy, please give City of Bones a try; this is the book that Jemisin took many inspirations for Stillness from.--My review of The Obelisk Gate.I am dying to read The Stone Sky."}, {"userName": "Matthias", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9889835-matthias", "userReview": "Noble Kreator JemisinGoddess of Broken Earth and Fallen MoonYou have made us a homeA planet of potential You have gifted us with historyFull of strife and wisdomWe are surrounded with beautyShrouded in mystery Talents were bestowed on usAnd the earth shakes as we discover themAngrily, it shakesBreathing fire, rock and poisonWe are strong but stand uncertainIn the face of our Father's wrathWe loveWe learnWe liveWe fightWe fleeWe fearPlease have mercy on what you have created.But the Goddess does not listen.

Jemisin\u2019s Broken Earth trilogy was an award-winning one. With all the accolades heaped onto these books and plenty of comprehensive reviews out there, I will keep my review of The Fifth Season relatively short.A superbly-crafted narrative that has both the familiar and the fantastical, The Fifth Season blends fantasy and science fiction most extraordinarily. The magic system, if one can term it as such, is intrinsically linked to the seismically unstable earth that has devastating Seasons striking the world every few centuries or so. It is called orogeny, which is the ability to wield and utilise the energies and power of the very earth itself. The entire story in The Fifth Season so far is foundational in introducing the reader to this vast continent called the Stillness (such an ironic name) and its lore, magic, culture, races and social structure. The representation of cultures and the people are probably one of the most diverse that I\u2019ve ever come across as well. For all the diversity present in this book, however, the message of discrimination and prejudice did hit pretty hard. Quite like a punch in the gut - it hurt and made me feel rather sick. By the end of this book, the full potential of an orogene\u2019s power is yet to be known but from what had been shown, it can truly be earth-shattering. There is also a lot of terminologies which might not make sense initially but as the story unfolds, context will gradually help one gain some semblance of understanding. Or there is always the glossary in the Appendix at the back of the book to refer to. The story was delivered in a most unique manner combining three types of narration or perspectives. There is the usual third-person perspective for two characters, Damaya and Syenite, but not before one gets thrown off kilter by the rarely seen second person POV for Essun, which came right after the Prologue that was written as the first-person narrator. I was initially a bit worried about how I will take to the second person perspective before I started this. Well, turned out that it felt familiar to me because of all the Fighting Fantasy role-playing gamebooks that I used to devour most voraciously during my teens. With that, it took me no time at all to get absorbed into the wonderfully different narrative of this remarkable book. There is nothing that I have read before which I can consider, by any stretch of the imagination, as similar to this novel. It contained a non-linear plot which was thoroughly engaging when coupled with the unique, immersive worldbuilding and excellent character development. The manner in which the stories of Damaya, Syenite and Essun come together can only be described as brilliant. The Fifth Season is without a doubt an extraordinary start to The Broken Earth trilogy, which I hope will shine even more brightly as I continue my journey henceforth."}, {"userName": "Mary ~Ravager of Tomes~", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1452829-mary-ravager-of-tomes", "userReview": "Actual Rating: 4.5 StarsThis book was weird in the best way possible.I don't know that I've ever read such a perfect blend of science fiction and high fantasy? It was a little jolting at first to reconcile my normal expectations of fantasy (a more medieval inspired setting) with what Jemisin presents here. This is a world with electricity and asphalt, but also with horse drawn carriages and primitive housing in certain locations. There are academic discussions about scientific matters while characters are bathing in a river. The juxtapose took me a second to get into, but after I did I really enjoyed the feeling it gave me.I absolutely loved that diverse perspectives offered in this book. Three female PoC perspectives, two of which are third person while the other is second person. Second person perspective is a very tricky one to pull off in my opinion, but all of these flowed seamlessly and flawlessly together.The plot of this one is largely a mystery for the majority of the novel, and you can feel the discoveries settling into place like pieces of a puzzle as you read. I feel like Jemisin has created a work of art with this novel. Like once this section of my puzzle finally made a picture, all I could say was \"Ohhh wow... would ya look at that?\"I believe it is best to go into this knowing as little as possible, as it really enhanced my reading experience. I didn't read a synopsis, I didn't read any reviews, I went in with a blindfold on. A huge part of the satisfaction from reading this comes from experiencing the twists and turns without being spoiled, SO BEWARE OF SPOILERS FOR THIS ONE ESPECIALLY.This world is full of magic and surprise and science. Jemisin's writing style beautifully compliments both its brutality and its originality. If you're put off by the dystopian labeling I encourage you to disregard it.

NK Jemisin took my expectations and shredded them. Confetti-style. Then after making a mockery of those, she promptly went ahead and delivered a very different book in a very awesome way. To start with, the worldbuilding in this book is something else. Jemisin presents a world that seems alternate but which could also, I believe, be our world in a very distant future. No real evidence is given to support the latter, but anything is possible and I will not write it off just yet.Picture a world consisting of one continent. The landscape is a broken, pitiful thing that experiences constant seismic events, pole shifts and violent, unyielding weather conditions. Jemisin has infused this planet with palpable malice and made it a real, living entity that seems to want to kill everything living on it, to purge itself of humanity. Listen, listen, listen well.There was an age before the Seasons, when life and Earth, its father, thrived alike. (Life had a mother, too. Something terrible happened to Her.) Earth our father knew He would need clever life, so He used the Seasons to shape us out of animals: clever hands for making things and clever minds for solving problems and clever tongues for working together and clever sessapinae to warn us of danger. The people became what Father Earth needed, and then more than He needed. Then we turned on Him, and He has burned with hatred for us ever since.Remember, remember, what I tell.\u2014Lorist recitation, \u201cThe Making of the Three Peoples,\u201d part oneIt is a daunting place to live in, with time measured by the seasons. The biggest threat to life on this rock, is a fifth season. This fifth season starts with a world-ending event and can last centuries whilst wiping out almost all life, leaving remnants of remnants to rebuild. The evidence of extinct civilizations is littered across the world and serves as a constant reminder of the fragility of these peoples existence.The way in which the author plants you in this reality, letting you figure out the rules and the history, was expertly done and very immersive. Even though there are moments of confusion when starting out, every piece of the puzzle that is gifted back to you, is doled out with perfect timing and pulls you in deeper.The cast enters\u2026First up, we have plain old humans. They have an ability we are not familiar with though, called sessing. This is done through some organs (Sessipinae) present in the base of the skull and allows them to be able to feel movements in the earth and so better prepare for possible danger. Human kind have banded together in communities they call comms for short and together they survive by following Stone Lore \u2013 basically a set of rules for survival that has been handed down and taught for generations \u2013 and preparing for possible apocalyptic events that punctuate their existence and occasionally wipe them out for the most part.Secondly we have Orogenes. These are humans who have the ability to manipulate the earth through a gift they call Orogeny. This entails them using thermal, kinetic and related forms of energy to manipulate seismic events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis in order to protect humanity and to help them in any way possible. This should make them heroes, but instead they are feared and reviled because of the deadly power they possess and comms shun or even kill them where possible. And so they hide, with the exception of Orogenes trained by an organization called The Fulcrum. The Orogenes are gods in chains \u2013 they are used throughout the continent to prevent earthquakes and more, but they are carefully monitored and not allowed to step out of line or to follow their own path. That brings me to the third group. The Guardians. There is very little know about them, apart from that each Orogene has a Guardian assigned to him or her. These Guardians are the ones tasked with monitoring the Orogenes and to protect them and protect others from them. Lastly there are the Stone Eaters. There is even less known about them than the Guardians. They are genderless beings rarely seen. They do as they please, go where they will, they move through stone with ease and their skin etc appears to be made of stone as well. The plot follows three women.Essun, Syenite and Damaya. They are all orogenes, they all have very different lives and they are all strong woman that are wonderfully written characters. When we meet them, Essun, an orogene in hiding, is plotting revenge and hoping to find her daughter, Syenite is being asked to breed with a master in her field in order to produce a gifted child and Damaya is being given away by her family to the organization who will train her to become an orogene. Life is no piece of cake.* Each storyline is spellbinding on it's own, but even more so when the individual threads start weaving together and these paths converge. Unfortunately that is as much as I can reveal. Bottom line, the wait to see the final picture is well worth it. Be warned though, throughout the three POV\u2019s you are presented with, two of them are written in third person and one is written in second person. The second person might bother some people. I found it weird to start with, but quickly got used to it.Personally my only gripe is that I thought this series was finished already when I started it, but only afterwards realized that I was thinking of City of Stairs. Nevertheless, I am now hooked and eager to start book two, even though the third is only due in Aug 2017. Definitely recommended!\u201cThis is what you must remember: the ending of one story is just the beginning of another. This has happened before, after all. People die. Old orders pass. New societies are born. When we say \u201cthe world has ended,\u201d it\u2019s usually a lie, because the planet is just fine.But this is the way the world ends.This is the way the world ends.\nThis is the way the world ends.\nFor the last time.\u201d*As this is such a dark and hopeless world I felt the need to insert cake into this review as it well known that cake makes everything better.PS: If you are not sure on this one check out some more reviews - there are fantastic ones that will more than likely convince you. I REALLY struggled putting thought to paper on this one."}], "description": "Listening time 15 hours 31 minutesThis is the way the world ends. Again.Three terrible things happen in a single day. Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.Now Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.", "title": "The Fifth Season\n      \n          (The Broken Earth #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27782650", "average": 4.31, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1447166459l/27782650.jpg", "reviews": 7089, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2917917.N_K_Jemisin", "name": "N.K.
