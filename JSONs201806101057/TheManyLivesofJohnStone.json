Told in multiple dimensions and through two main characters, it is a story unlike any other I have read.With a very slow start and a writing style truly unique in voice, it took me a bit to get into it but once there, it wasn't hard to read on and want to know the rest of the story. Sadly this was not a time travel story but rather you traveled back in time through the entries of a diary, and while somewhat disappointed at that, I did enjoy the diary entries.It was fascinating to learn about court life in France and the history buff in me couldn't help but gravitate towards those entries more than anything else. Especially as the story unfolded and we really got to know who John Stone is.While sometimes wordy in description, the story did have a unique take on the overall plot of the story and in the end, I did end up enjoying this more than I initially thought I would. *An ARC Copy of this was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*"}, {"userName": "Elevetha ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11828657-elevetha", "userReview": "IT'S LABELED UNDER \"TIME TRAVEL\" ON THE SIMON AND SCHUSTER WEBSITE.Possible description found here:  \"When seventeen-year-old Spark takes a summer job working at a secluded house in England, organizing journals that span centuries and all written in the same hand, she discovers her true connection to the people who live there and the trait that makes them unique.\"EDIT.Oooh, yay, GR has a description up!"}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5963725-terri", "userReview": "Review also found at http://kristineandterri.blogspot.ca/2...** I received an advanced copy of this book from the publisher via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.

It is a melting pot of genres which in my mind is really kind of cool.

It picks up speed and you are rewarded if you stick with it. Given that the book synopsis does not give much of the story away, I feel I cannot as well.

If it's trying to be a time travel/immortal mystery, it's just too quiet to be truly compelling. If it's trying to be a more mysterious historical fictiony-type thing, why introduce a minor weirdness that is almost too small to notice halfway through? And why on earth is this being marketed to teens? Age it up, give it some teeth, and you might actually have an interesting story here instead of a book for teens written in sometimes-arcane language that, in part, follows a grown adult doing grown adult things.Just an overwhelmingly frustrating read that I gave more time to than I ultimately should have.

She wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect, and her uncertainty about living at Stowney House only increases upon arriving: what kind of people live in the twenty-first century without using electricity, telephones, or even a washing machine? Additionally, the notebooks she\u2019s organizing span centuries\u2014they begin in the court of Louis XIV in Versailles\u2014but are written in the same hand. Something strange is going on for sure, and Spark\u2019s questions are piling up. Who exactly is John Stone? What connection does he have to these notebooks? And more importantly, why did he hire her in the first place?First of all, this is not a time travel book and that blurb is misleading with regards to plot. Considering genres and blurbs are what usually get me into a book, I was a bit miffed on this point. Had I not known of this before going into the book, could my experience have been different? I doubt it. The plot revolves around John Stone, so much so that even in third person account, his full name John Stone is used in every sentence. I get it - it was the anglicized version of his French name, but it was a bit discomforting to the eye. So John aka Jean-Pierre, lived in the court of The Sun King, a time when being morally upstanding was perhaps not the best in a court full of manipulations. John being what he is (I will refrain from spoiling readers), he is considered an anomaly, but a curious one - something to keep as part of a collection. Most of the book chronicles his time in the court - which hardly has anything much to do with the current era, plot-wise. See, Jean was taught to keep his existence a secret, so he keeps it even in the current age, living with two other people of his kind, in seclusion, somewhere in Suffolk. He is Monsieur Broody - that's how exhausting his recollection of his 'lives' have been (another way the title is misleading, along with the cover!). He hires Stella as an intern to organize his archives, but actually wants her to be their Friend, a confidant, based on the fact that he suspects she is his dead wife's daughter. And while he is on a deadline, he takes his own sweet time to letting her know of her heritage, rather than, I don't know - letting her de-crypt the archives and find out herself. No, she gets that at the end of the book, in the form of the notebooks which we read throughout the book. So while there could have been more interesting stories as to his 'family' pasts so that she can understand them better, he regales her with a long saga of his first love and time at the glorious court of Henry XIV. And what was more frustrating was the slow pace of the book - I was constantly looking at the progress bar to see when it will end. There wasn't much in way of conflict, and the thing about the assassin was never resolved. Why exactly did the assassin strike? I thought there would be contemporary repercussions to it, but nada. The only conflict was a stubborn man's pride and unwillingness to depend on those close to him, but miraculously that is all resolved in a matter of sentences at the end of the book. Basically, this was exhausting for me to read.

Stories like this keep the reader guessing and interested in the plot and characters. The Many Lives of John Stone was not one of these books.First things first, the characters were no where near interesting and never described. It took about 300 pages for the author to finally announce that the main character, Stella Park (or Spark for short *eye-roll*) was blonde. 300 PAGES! The other characters were just stereotypes rolled into stereotypes and I was bored quite quickly. Second, the love plot felt like it was added only because the author felt like she was forced to add it. It made no sense to the main story whatsoever, and the characters were never around each other enough in order for the chemistry between Ludo and Spark to heat up. Literally she just looks at him and she's entranced but does not see him until the very end of the book and suddenly the author expects us to care about their relationship. Third, the mystery? Girl, what Mystery?! There was nothing that was revealed in the end that made the whole book worth the read. Something intriguing would be brought up and then two pages later it would be revealed to the reader, but maybe not the main characters. The only mystery I haven't solved yet is why I kept reading. Fourth, the history made no sense. I love history especially when multiple centuries get tied together but only one time period was reported on, and even still, not that accurately. Even when other time periods were brought in they were only lightly touched upon and given in a pedestrian way. Example: the sounds of bombs during the London Blitz. Everyone knows there were bombs, give me something more!Fifth, no consistency within the book whatsoever. The characters change personalities constantly and important facts were never brought up again. However, the main mystery of the story is easily guessed by the summary on the back cover. Finally, the two intertwining story lines made no sense together! I understand that John Stone wanted to account his early life, but none of the characters that were introduced in the present-day story line were ever talked about in the past. Martha's and Jacob's stories are never told and we NEVER learn the backstory of Therese, but don't worry we learn all about John and his troubles with the court of Louis XIV. I just felt like the story that should have been told wasn't and the \"mystery\" was never there for me.It failed, so much missed opportunity with this story..."}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39004831-tina", "userReview": "[ The fact that we learn little to nothing about John's time with Therese was especially surprising and frustrating.-Spark's reaction to the \"secret\" of John Stone's life was remarkably subtle.

The Many Lives Of John Stone by Linda Buckley Archer. 4/5. The Many Lives Of John Stone is a novel that revolves around the concept of longevity and people that are sempervivum. But to the extremist of the extreme of circumstances. Protagonist Stella Park (Spark) is hired to organize notebooks at a man named John Stone\u2019s house in Suffolk, England. Two other people live there, named Martha and Jacob, and the description of odd fits them both pretty well. To her surprise Spark finds these notebooks span from modern times all the way back to the sixteen hundreds - and they are all written in the same handwriting and written by someone named Jean-Pierre who lived in the seventeenth century. Stowney House is a peculiar place, and the more she learns about it, the more she realizes she doesn\u2019t know about the place, its people and the secrets that all of it has in hiding. \tThis novel took the concepts of longevity and being a sempervivum to a whole other ball game. The owner of the Suffolk Estate, called Stowney House, is a sempervivum. His name is John Stone; but he\u2019s also Jean-Pierre. This was a book unlike any other I\u2019d ever read before - it had narration in a unique format, too. Part of was narrated by Spark, and parts were copies of John Stone\u2019s notebooks, his diaries going all the way back from when he worked in the Sun King Louis XIV\u2019s palace in Versailles. It was interesting to see the historical input that Jean-Pierre/John Stone had as he grew up a few hundred years ago, and the impact that it had on his life and the lives of others in the modern day."}, {"userName": "Cindy Mitchell *Kiss the Book*", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19521241-cindy-mitchell-kiss-the-book", "userReview": "Buckley-Archer, Linda The Many Lives of John Stone, 529 pgs.

If you have ever asked yourself that questions, all you have to do is look at The Many Lives of John Stone. (NOTE: The book blurb presented at the top of the review was not the original blurb I read when I picked up this novel. The blurb above does a lot better job of sort of establishing the lack of time travel). The Many Lives of John Stone first caught my eye right before it was published. It was classified as time travel and supernatural. The time travel came straight from the publisher's own website. Imagine my surprise when I started reading this book and there wasn't any time travel involved. It will be hard to describe this novel without giving away potential spoilers, but I will do my best. Upon reading The Many Lives of John Stone, I was shocked when I had gotten to the 50% mark and there wasn't one bit of time travel involved. Little did I realize that the 'time travel' aspect of this book was actually a bunch of journals that dated back centuries. Yes, the entire traveling back in time aspect of this book involved readers every few chapters being given glimpses into a notebook written by a young man as he learns to navigate the ins and outs of the court of Louis XIV. In a way, the journals do take you back in time but no one is physically traveling through time and space, which was extremely disappointing. I wouldn't say the book blurb lied or purposely misled people, but it hinted at certain things that didn't happen. If it hadn't hinted at those things or even been classified as time travel, the book would have been able to find a true audience. Even though I was disappointed in being misled, The Many Lives of John Stone was an interesting read \u2013 had it been classified properly. It was intriguing and mysterious. While I didn't really find any of the character particularly enduring, the historical aspect of it and the slight undertone of a mystery was enough to keep me reading and wanting to know what was going on. It should be noted that the mystery involved in The Many Lives of John Stone isn't the typical 'who done it' mystery. It is more of a life's mystery, which involves uncovering secrets people have kept over the years. The Many Lives of John Stone does move at a bit of a sluggish pace. If you are looking for action and adventure, this isn't the book for you. There are huge chunks of descriptions that involve court life in France, living in the modern day world in a cottage in Suffolk, and learning about a young woman named Stella. There isn't really a moment in the book when things pick up, but instead things move at a very slow pace until the book ends. It is interesting to note that while the publisher choose to classify this as a YA book, it doesn't really fit the typical YA genre. There is a lot of flowery, ambitious writing involved that would certainly make this a book for the older side of YA, to the point where it could almost be classified as an 'adult' novel. Without being able to discuss too much of the plot, which if I did it would completely ruin the entire book and your experience, it is difficult. I will say that if the summary sounds even the least bit exciting it is worth the time to give it a try. The Many Lives of John Stone was certainly a satisfying read and well-written, but the rather misleading aspect leads to disappointment. I think, while The Many Lives of John Stone, was interesting and unique, it will struggle to find an audience. The YA classification might be enough to drive the 'adult' reader away who would find this interesting, while the lack of true time travel and sluggish pace would drive the average YA reader away. In the end, I am really glad I stuck it out and read the entire book. It was certainly something I don't normally read and unique. I hope it finds its audience, because for the right reader this is sure to be entertaining. This gets 2 stars partly because it was 100% not what the summary said. No time travel, no real mystery to solve, no multiple centuries to explore.

It is, in a sense, two stories rolled up in to one book. In fact, it was almost too much of difference in the two timelines around which the book takes place. The main story takes place in modern day England and is told in the third person- present tense perspective. This part of the story follows a seventeen year old girl named Spark on her journey to Stowney House where she works for a man named John Stone and the mysterious occupants of his home in the English countryside. The second part of the story is told through a set of journals, written in first person- past tense, by John Stone. The journals are set in Versailles, France in the 1600\u2019s. In the course of the novel Spark makes many discoveries about both herself and John Stone.My thoughts: I think I loved the idea of the story more than the actual story. Maybe I was simply let down by my own high expectations, or maybe I\u2019m not the only one who was a little let down. First off, let me say, reading John Stone was a little like talking a walk with your drunken best friend. Buckley-Archer was constantly changing from third person to first person; and, for no particular reason, switching fonts, a personal pet peeve. (I mean, honestly, we\u2019re all adults. We don\u2019t need to run through the entire list of fonts like we\u2019re back in third grade.) The perspective switching was only annoying in the fact that we experience John Stone in both third and first person. I preferred the first person parts of the story more than third person as I feel that Buckley-Archer writes a far more compelling first person. I also wish that we could have heard from Spark herself in first person narration.In addition, the story itself was all over the place, switching locations, time periods, narrators far to frequently for my taste.John Stone\u2019s journals, set in France in the 1600\u2019s, are my favorite part of the story. Buckley-Archer really, truly painted a beautiful picture of the court of Versailles; the clothing, the architecture, the lords and ladies of the court. I would love to read a book about the rest of John Stones life, everything from the end of his journals to the beginning of this novel. John\u2019s voice is very strong and hard to walk away from. In present day England, John Stone lives with two other long-lived characters (sempervivens, as they are called), Jacob and Martha. While we do get a little back story on Martha, both of these characters are lacking in depth and history. I only bring this up because we get far more of a back story of Spark\u2019s mother who is far less relevant to the story (and in my opinion far less interesting). I particularly would have liked to know more about Jacob\u2019s backstory as he was one of my favorite characters. All in all, I gave it three stars because while it had a fantastic ending and some great parts to it, I couldn\u2019t quite stay interested in most of the story. The only reason I didn\u2019t put the book down was because of the journals up until the twist at the end, around 425 pages in. I wanted to love Spark and Dan and Ludo but I just couldn\u2019t. They lacked a proper voice. I wanted to love Martha and Jacob, but they were only an idea, nothing real behind them. I would recommend this book only to fans of historical fiction because, while it has fantasy and science fiction, if you are lover of either of those genres you won\u2019t be captured by the little bit of both in this novel.

But long books make me weary and I am intimidated to begin them, and after that endeavour, finishing them. That being said, I didn't think I'd come to like this book as much as I do now. Not saying that this is going to be my favourite, but it certainly is something. When I first saw this book, the cover and synopsis had me obsessed. But the book is quite slow, and at first, quite aimless, so I began to feel less than impressed.However, this was beautifully written and I'm glad I continued on with it. The ending made me tear up, I will admit. I wish I didn't put this off for so long. I don't think this is the type of book everyone will love\u2014you've got to have patience. It's slow and there isn't much action. Admittedly, it's rather dull at times. But I'm still going to hope that many people check it out when it's released.

I rarely have come across novels written in the present tense, but in this case that unusual choice made the writing extra engaging because it was easy to imagine the events unfolding in real time. In what I found to be such an unusual mystery of a plot that it kept me plowing deeper into the book, two contrasting story lines intertwine, one set in modern day ordinary England and the other in opulent Versailles during the reign of Louis XIV. A few loose ends linger at the end of the tale, but just as Stella Park (affectionately known as \"Spark\") is only beginning to understand the remarkably strange but true circumstances of one man's many long years of life, so was I the reader astounded."}, {"userName": "Teri", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1278262-teri", "userReview": "I was given this book to read by one of my local librarians. She wanted me to see if it was more YA or Adult Fiction, and just what I thought about it in general.This was an interesting and leisurely read that doesn't quite fit into one genre. I've read some reviews that said the book was categorized as \"time travel,\" which definitely doesn't fit, since there is no physical time travel occurring! I guess I'd call this book YA fiction with a generous splash of historical fiction. Ms. Buckley-Archer's writing style reminded me of Diana Wynne-Jones and Maggie Stiefvater, since she crafts her characters and settings in a very artistic way. I definitely want to explore the lives of the secondary characters in this book, and hope to read more from Ms. Buckley-Archer in the future."}], "description": "An English teen questions all she knows about aging when she encounters a set of journals that date from the present back to the reign of King Louis XIV in this blend of contemporary and historical fiction from the author of the acclaimed Gideon trilogy.Stella Park (Spark for short) has found summer work cataloging historical archives in John Stone\u2019s remote and beautiful house in Suffolk, England.
