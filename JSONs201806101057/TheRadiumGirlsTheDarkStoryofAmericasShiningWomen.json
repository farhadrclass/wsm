I actually read this one back at the beginning of October, but I was too emotional to write a review straight away and have avoided it since. Sometimes I have trouble with emotions; for many years I avoided some of the richest books with the highest quality stories because I simply was terrified of having to process the heavy feelings behind them. I've slowly begun working on this issue, and while I can't read a slew of emotional books in a row, I have begun to place them strategically in my line up. I think the hardest part about this one is it's real; these women existed in our world and suffered the things discussed in this book which tears my heart into little pieces. I've watched firsthand how cancer can ravage the body of someone you love, but that was just a small piece of the hell these brave warriors had to endure. Ugh, grab a hanky and let's get going.This was not a book I could race through; I read another review stating how she had to pick up the book and place it down in what felt like 2 minute increments-this is exactly how it felt slowly trudging through this story. My initial interest in the history behind \"the radium girls\" spawned after reading another book that had a small chapter of information in it titled Forensics: What Bugs, Burns, Prints, DNA and More Tell Us About Crime by Val McDermid (highly recommend this book even to those crime fiction fans who do not typically read non-fiction as this read like fiction!). After the brief intro into their story, I knew I had to find out more. I was blown away at their courage and strength which is portrayed in this book as well. The hardest part about reading this one was the depth it went into to ensure we understand just how much these women suffered and how honorable their fight was to fight those who placed them in this position and find justice.One of the most important takeaways I found though was how proud and honored this story made me feel to be a woman. These females were a class act; they were determined during a time when women were considered second class citizens. We could certainly use some role models such as these in today's world; the example of the strength in numbers and how to hold each other up when you are falling apart, physically and emotionally, was not lost on me. I found myself going to great lengths wondering what happened to our society between now and then; have the subtle advancements for women caused us to compete with each other in seclusion rather than band together while building one another up? I feel like I could ramble on for days regarding this book, but if you can stomach the horror and emotion regarding this much overlooked part of our history, I think it will ensure deep reflection and cause us to question some of how we approach living our lives and what we hold important. I know I'll hold this story deep in my soul for the rest of my life, it was that powerful.*I'd like to thank the author and publisher for providing my copy via NetGalley; it was my pleasure to provide an honest review."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68050592-lori", "userReview": "\u201cI can\u2019t laugh about those poor women who painted the clocks,\u201d said Sarah. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t laugh about.\u201d\u201cNobody wants you to.\u201d said her grandmother. \u201cYou run along now.\u201dSarah was referring to an industrial tragedy that was notorious at the time. Sarah\u2019s family was in the middle of it, and sick about it. Sarah had already told me that she was sick about it, and so had her brother, my roommate, and so had their father and mother. The tragedy was a slow one that could not be stopped once it had begun, and it began in the family\u2019s clock company, the Wyatt Clock Company, one of the oldest companies in the United States, in Brockton, Massachusetts. It was an avoidable tragedy. The Wyatts never tried to justify it, and would not hire lawyers to justify it. It could not be justified.It went like this: In the nineteen twenties the United States Navy awarded Wyatt Clock a contract to produce several thousand standardized ships\u2019 clocks that could be easily read in the dark. The dials were to be black. The hands and the numerals were to be hand-painted with white paint containing the radioactive element radium. About half a hundred Brockton women, most of them relatives of regular Wyatt Clock Company employees, were hired to paint the hands and numerals. It was a way to make pin money. Several of the women who had young children to look after were allowed to do the work at home.Now all those women had died or were about to die most horribly with their bones crumbling, with their heads rotting off. The cause was radium poisoning. Every one of them had been told by a foreman, it had since come out in court, that she should keep a fine point on her brush by moistening it and shaping it with her lips from time to time.Jailbird by Kurt Vonnegut (1979)Charlotte Purcell, one of the painters, demonstrates the lip-pointing technique that they used to get the brushes to a fine point. Chicago Daily Timeshttp://chicagotonight.wttw.com/sites/...In the real world, the girls mostly worked because they needed the money. They painted watch faces and instrument dials with paint containing radium from 1910-1935. They didn\u2019t all die, many of them did, and the destruction of their bones was horrific. Their employers did fight the girl's lawsuits and fought dirty. Kate Moore tells the Radium Girls stories their personalities, hopes and friendships. She makes them more than a group of anonymous plaintiffs. The term 'girls' is accurate at the time of their employment licking and painting with radioactive material. They were so very young at twenty-eight, Sarah Maillefer appeared matronly to her teenaged coworkers. Some of them were little more than children, \u201crecords show that some were as young as eleven.\u201d At the Ottawa, Illinois factory, they played in the radium using surplus paint on their eyelashes and lips painting. The same as the Brazillian children played with the blue \u201ccarnival glitter\u201d in the Goi\u00e2nia. The results were lethal, although for workers exposed to and consuming radium all day the play is unlikely to have a measurable increase in toxicity. The dial painters are estimated to have 500 times the radiation limit.I kept remembering an interview with Fuzhou factory owner, Roger Wong, in the 2005 documentary, \u201cMardi Gras: Made in China.\u201d 95% of his factory\u2019s workforce are women mainly teenage girls because it is \u201ceasier to control the lady workers.\u201d The toxin there is to Styrene, which impacts brain and nerve function as well as a suspected carcinogen. The working conditions and pay are worse than the clean factories and good jobs of the dial painters.

NOW AVAILABLE !!4.5 Stars rounded upI wanted to showcase their shining spirits in a book that would tell their story \u2013 not just the story of the famous professionals who had helped them.I aimed to chart their journey: from the joy of their first lucrative paycheck, through the first aching tooth, to the courage each girl had to find inside herself in order to fight back against the employer who had poisoned her. I wanted to walk their routes to work and visit their homes and graves. I wished to trace the path between the Maggia sisters\u2019 houses and appreciate how difficult it must have been to manage the steep, sloping hill with a radium-induced limp.Seventeen young women, some very young, with a lifetime of promise ahead of them. In a time when jobs were scarce and glamorous jobs were few and far between, landing a job with Radium Luminous Materials Corporation in Newark, New Jersey was considered a coup. A factory job, in essence, but they referred to it as a studio, these girls were paid to paint watch dial numerals and hands with a luminous substance that made them visible in the dark. On 1 February 1917, Katherine Schaub was making her way to \u201cthe studio\u201d for her first day on the job. Katherine was just fourteen years old. Radium. Its virtues were extolled everywhere one looked. Magazines, newspapers called it the greatest find of history. New radium products popped up with claims of everything from improved health to being the answer to eternal life. Katherine only saw it as beautiful, a luminous glow. At first, Katherine was trained by Mae Cubberly. Another young woman, Mae was twenty years old. Using very fine paintbrushes, she instructed Katherine in the technique that all of the dial painters were taught. Lip-pointing: putting the brushes in their mouths to make the tip finer, a technique learned from girls who formerly worked in china-painting factories. Mae even lets her know that she had been worried about ingesting the radium and asked if the radium would hurt them, but had been told it wasn\u2019t dangerous, if anything it would be beneficial. Lip\u2026Dip\u2026Paint.When working in the \u201cdarkroom,\u201d Katherine would call in workers, and could see the signs of the luminous paint on the worker, on the clothes, on the lips, on face and hands, shining. They looked glorious, like otherworldly angels.And then America joined the war in Europe. Demand increased. The company opened a plant in Orange, New Jersey, not too far from the Newark factory. The company expanded right into the middle of a residential neighborhood, and some of the new workers hired lived there. Grace Fryer, eighteen \u2013 her two brothers would be heading to France to fight alongside millions. Irene Corby, seventeen. Of course, the new girls were learning to \u201cLip\u2026Dip\u2026Paint.\u201dAnd years pass, it\u2019s the early 1920s, some girls had left the radium company, but it was never long before their spot was filled with some young, new girl thrilled to land this glamorous job. Some of the girls began to complain of being tired, mysterious and unrelenting pains. Some left to find other jobs, some just left, incapable of the demands any longer. Keep in mind that the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote, was only ratified in 1920. In a world dominated by men, these mysterious illnesses were cast off as frivolous, \u201cwomen\u2019s complaints.\u201d This is the story of their fight to be heard, of their fight to find the real cause of these myriad plagues that beset them. Who would be the ones to champion their cause, and who would be those rich and powerful men who would not only deceive them, deny their own wrong-doing, lying through their teeth, making empty promises of recompense which would later be denied or reneged on. Heartbreaking as it is, these stories are not about delicate little flowers who fall trembling at the feet of the rich and powerful. These are women, who, though physically weakened, found the strength and determination to do what needed to be done - not only themselves or their families, but to protect those still working with radium, and everyone in the future. This is a well-researched story, and it shows. The sense of injustice is palpable, the story flows evenly, but varies from the fact-delivering, non-fictional voice as the author enters more emotional territory and paints the picture of scenes one could only imagine without her words. A compelling account of another era, the evolution of the rights of the average worker, but especially those working women whose voices they tried, in vain, to suppress and invalidate.Pub Date: 1 May 2017Many thanks for the ARC provided by Sourcebooks"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol", "userReview": "Whew!

During the beginning of the twentieth century radioactive elements were newly discovered and many were excited about the possible curative uses for them. One of the elements radium was used to paint watch dials as well as in many beauty and health products marketed to the masses. When World War I broke out the production of radium painted clocks rose and many more women became employed painting them. The common practice was to use one's mouth to smooth out the ends of the paint brush leading to many women ingesting lethal amounts of radium. Eventually when the effects started to show the women had trouble finding out what caused their sickness and then trying to get the companies to acknowledge and help them pay the medical bills pilling up. The author succeeded in humanizing and bringing to life the radium girls and I honestly was boiling over with rage through out when the companies wouldn't help the girls out even though they were doing fine financially. I can't believe they went to all those lengths instead of just doing the right thing to begin with, especially because it seems like it honestly would have been cheaper to just help the girls with their medical bills."}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032725-debra", "userReview": "4.5 StarsImagine you have your first job. Imagine how proud you are. Or maybe it is not your first job, but it is a fun job where you get to socialize if you get your job done. A job that allows you to do something important for your country. Imagine you are helping your friends and sisters obtain a job as well. Imagine you work with a super cool substance which glows in the dark. A substance you believe is safe - your employer tells you is safe. A substance that one young woman painted on her own teeth before a date. A substance that Thomas Edison deemed dangerous. A substance you paint on. A substance that some women were known to eat the paint because they enjoyed it. Now, imagine how painful it must be to have your teeth fall out, to have your jaw come out, to have the bones in your face disintegrate. Imagine your bones begin to hurt so bad you can barely move. Imagine one leg suddenly becoming 4 inches shorter than the other. Imagine bleeding to death. Imagine giving birth to a stillborn baby. Imagine going from being young and healthy to being dead in less than a week.The poor women in this book did not have to imagine any of these things because they lived this. This book is about the young women who wanted to do their part to help the war effort during World War I. These women worked in radium factories painting the faces on clocks. They were working with a luminous material and were come to be called as the \"shining girls\" They took a tremendous amount of pride in their jobs and many liked that they could \"glow\" in the dark. But then one by one they began having dental problems. The dental problems were only the beginning.The women began to die horribly painful deaths. Their loved ones left with questions unanswered. Most of the women were misdiagnosed in the beginning. Eventually their deaths became connected and the dangers of radium and radium poisoning were known. Thus, began a huge scandal and a fight for workers\u2019 rights.The writing of this book was captivating. I found myself absorbed in these women's stories. Even as they were dying, these women tried hard to complete their doctor\u2019s tests to determine if radium was to blame for their impending death. The Author did a wonderful job in bringing these women's stories to life. To show how they and their families had to battle for their rights. How a company can deny accountability and turn their back on these women. How their loved ones and lawyers fought for them and their rights. Wowza.

Interview with the author can now be found here: http://avalinahsbooks.space/interview...They were called \nThe Girls With Radioactive Bones.\nThere were newspaper headlines such as \n'\n\nLiving Dead' Win In Court' \nabout them.And all that \u2013 almost \na hundred years ago.\nI'm going to tell you a very painful, sad, but strong story of fighting for your rights, for justice, for your honor even. So let's start.If there was ever a time that I wanted to believe the Christian \nhell with burning pits of fire,\n it would be when reading \nThe Radium Girls. \nIt's because you can sell anything. You can make people believe the worst poison is a cure. You can sell other people's lives. And in the process, sell your own soul. And that's what the burning hell is there for.So if you still haven't heard what \nThe Radium Girls\n is about, let it be my pleasure to enlighten you.Back in the early 20th century, \npeople didn't know a lot about radiation\n. Rather, they did, but they didn't have a habit of sharing information, like we do now. Which is why it was thought that radium, a highly radioactive substance, was in fact good for you. Because it sold well. \nBecause any miracle cure \nalways sells well.\nSo nobody even batted an eyelash when radium dial clock factories sprang up and started hiring young women to paint in their studios. Not wearing any protective suits. Putting the radium-covered brush straight into their mouths. Ingesting the radium. Like they were instructed. Because \n'the radium is good for you'.\n It will put rosy cheeks on you.Photo courtesy of The Atlantic\nIt's not that they didn't bat an eyelash, really \u2013 they were actually even jealous of the girls,\n of their shining clothes and shining hair \u2013 as they returned from work. All covered in radioactive, glaring radium. \nLike a fairytale curse \u2013 enchanted pixie dust,\n that will bring you happiness, a fortune, that will make your position coveted and make every other girl jealous of your angelic glow. And yet, coming with a price akin to the fairytale one, where you have to give away your firstborn. Which was also what some of these girls pretty much did.Unfortunately for them, back in the 1920's, the US government wasn't too keen about interfering with companies. So when they started dying horrible, torturous deaths one by one, dropping like flies, nobody intervened. They were called names. Liars. They were said to have died of sexually transmitted diseases. All the while suffering the worst kind of physical pain, because... the radium was literally in their bones. So much so, that decades, \nhundreds of years after we're all gone, the remains of these girls in their graves will still glow and emit radiation.\nSo \nthis story is about how these poor, brave women fought for justice,\n for at least a little bit of honor in the end of their lives, and for the ones after them. For all of you. Because \nthis is why\n you can now boast some safety in your jobs. \nThis\n is why you are not forced to quit when you get sick. It's also why your bosses are not allowed to blatantly lie to you if they make you work with dangerous substances. And especially as women (if you, reader, are one), you have a lot to thank these girls for.I could say so much about this story. In fact, \nI could quote the entire book.\n But that would kind of defeat the purpose of you reading it, wouldn't it? Which is what I must urge you to do, because \nyou must know.\n You must know \nhow much pain\n it took for our lives to be paved the way they are, to build up to this point. \nThis is the least we can do for these girls \u2013 hear their story. Say a prayer for them. Remember them.\nThe women we meet in this book are all so exceptional, bright, warm, cheerful. The way some of them fight this incredibly crippling condition they're faced with was so inspiring. And heartbreaking, at the same time. This book doesn't read like like non-fiction, for starters! \nYou will be drawn into the story instantly,\n you will even cry. Some of you \u2013 more than once. You will curse the people who did this to them, even though they knew what they were doing. You will be angry, maybe even furious. I don't see how anyone could remain a stone statue in the presence of something like this.\n I dare you.\nBut your heart will also swell with love. For the wonderful people who helped them. For the husbands and lovers of those young women who never threw them away, even when they were helpless shadows of their former selves, unable to move, to speak, to eat. You will bless the few lawyers and judges who weren't in it for the money, who fought for justice and for their own belief in the world. And most of all, your heart will swell with love for those young women who had no other option but to die, to die a graceful death, to die a proud death \u2013 because that's all that was left to them.\nPrecious materials are more precious than human life.\n Such is the tendency today as well. Maybe not in the Western world anymore. But in some places of the world it still is. In the beginning of this post, I said anything can be sold. This book will make you wonder \nwhat is being sold to you right now.\nI am also very happy to announce to you all that the author Kate Moore has agreed to give an interview on my blog! I will be publishing it in the coming two weeks, most likely, and you are very welcome to hear the story of how this book came to be. I have a lot of respect for Kate because of how warmly she treated the memory of the girls when she was writing this book.I am also deeply thankful to Kate Moore and Sourcebooks for giving me an advance copy of in exchange for my honest review. This was a bigger gift than you could imagine. This book was worth all my love and all my tears.\nIf you feel for these girls and their story, please share my post. We must make stories like this heard. I want this story to be known by as many people as possible, so we can all honor their memory.

I think probably if you read it will depend on what you are looking for, and once again I found a blurb misleading. I though I would get to know these girls with a bit more depth, but so many girls are mentioned that was virtually Impossible though some are mentioned more often then others. The skipping around between the plants, the two locations was a bit disruptive and confusing at times. Their suffering, the horror of what they eventually go through, so many died, so young, this does come through, loud and clear, rightfully so. Still all that I mentioned, did make for repetitious reading. I expected a more straightforward narrative, an intimate narrative account,and that is not this book, though I am very glad I read it. Big companies, doing bad things, hiding things for profit, are still and always will I believe happen. Avarice and greed are two of the seven deadly sins for a reason.

It evoked such emotion with the details it revealed throughout and was both highly readable and thrilling. These women deserve to be recognised for the huge sacrifices they made, all they asked was the same as most of us do now - a steady job with money coming in, yet, what they got turned into something else entirely. Kate Moore did exactly what she set out to do by writing a truly honest and heartbreaking tale of these incredibly brave and shining women whose lives were taken for granted by the greedy radium companies. They knew of the harm radium could do but in order to profit from the radium binge, let the women continue with their practices. This is an important book with regards to workplace reform but also will be of interest to those in medical and science fields or with interest in them.

To others realizing their jobs are causing their illness, to their fight against the companies and their legal battles and then for some realizing they are going to die. Moore doesn\u2019t shy away from the vivid details of the agonizing deaths and suffering the women went through and it\u2019s not for the faint hearted. I think that might be me as I found the torment they went through relentless and their agonizing suffering and the deaths after deaths started to become too overwhelming for me. Some of what I was reading just became a blur to me and at times I just wanted to get through the book. As much as the girls suffering broke my heart, the greed, dishonesty and the refusal to protect the young women from the danger was shocking and angered me.

When added to paint this 'liquid sunshine' could glow in the dark. In 1916, Radium Luminous Materials Corporation opened its doors in Newark, New Jersey and operated a watch dial studio that employed local girls, the daughters and granddaughters of immigrants, as painters. One hundred years ago, before OSHA and the EPA, industry had few restrictions or oversight of their workplaces in their pursuit of profits so even though the inventor of the paint knew of its destructive capabilities, the girls were not given any warnings or protective gear to wear. In fact, they were instructed to put the slim camel-hair brushes in their mouths to get a finer point for their work. Lip...Dip...Paint. Over and over, thousands of times a day.With WWI in full swing, the demand for radium dials and watches was booming; the company paid an attractive wage and employed as many as 375 girls at the peak of business. The job wasn't for everyone: some couldn't work at the pace demanded, some didn't like the taste of the paint, and some developed mouth sores quickly. But those who were talented and quick enough stayed on, liking the workplace and especially the decent salary they were paid.The first signs of illness and changes in blood resembled phosphorus poisoning, a well-known industrial poisoning in Newark, and the girls confronted their employers. They were assured that there was no need to worry--the radium amounts in the paint were so minuscule that it could not possibly cause them harm. In 1921, a corporate takeover ousted the original founder of the company and the business, renamed United States Radium Corporation, was poised to flourish in the postwar world. As the girls sickened, doctors and dentists were flummoxed by the illnesses the girls came to see them with: loose teeth, gum sockets that would not heal after extractions, pronounced limps, aches and pains. But since the girls saw different experts, all these differing complaints were not connected to one workplace.When radium poisoning was first suggested, it was highly contested by the industry and legal suits fell by the wayside as prevailing laws did not support the workers' claims.Meanwhile, 800 miles away in Ottawa, Illinois, another business started up in September of 1922: Radium Dial Company with its head office in Chicago. And the use of the 'lip, dip, paint' technique was taught to a whole new group of eager young women employees. And the deadly process began again. Other books have been written about this whole sorry and horrifying business but in this book, Kate Moore says she wanted to bring the girls' personal stories to light and give them a voice--all their hopes, dreams, pain, suffering and eventual deaths. But most importantly, how these women stood up for their rights with strength, dignity and courage. Because of their legal cases, the US government eventually formed OSHA and the EPA. Kudos to these brave women!Having lived in the general vicinity of Ottawa, IL since 1981, we were aware of this sad, shameful history through displays in local history museums but didn't realize that the area where these jobs were carried on is still in the process of being cleaned up as of 2015, according to Moore. Radium has a half-life of 1500 years! And a spinoff of the original Radium Dial company carried on business until 1978 under the name of Luminous Processes, and when workers there noticed a high incidence of breast cancer, the company denied its culpability. And the beat goes on...Many thanks to NetGalley, the publisher and author for the opportunity to read an arc of this important and moving work of nonfiction. Thank you for bringing these women's stories to life in these pages.Notes: It was a pleasure to meet author Kate Moore at a program she gave for Seneca Public Library, Seneca, IL on March 19, 2018. She genuinely cares for these women and their stories. I also sat next to the great niece of Catherine Donohue, the brave woman who won her law suit against Radium Dial even as she lay dying. It was a pleasure to meet her as well and learn more about her family."}, {"userName": "Juli", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli", "userReview": "In the early 1900s Radium was a sensation. The Curie's discovery was touted as a cure-all, a miracle, a wonder. At the time, little was understood about the side effects of handling Radium, however. In an era when most jobs for women were low paying, young women lined up for positions painting clock faces with radium paint. The jobs were high paying and gave them status in their community. The clock faces glowed a radiant green in the dark, making them a popular purchase. These girls sat for hours happily painting, pointing their paint brushes by swishing them in their mouths. They played games with leftover radium paint, drawing moustaches on themselves, painting their eyebrows, dabbing a bit on their lips. Then they would huddle in a dark room, laughing at the bright green glow. The effect didn't wear off after work. Their clothes, their hair, even their skin would glow. Often they wore their best dresses to work so that their clothing would glow at parties. What they didn't realize is the painful effects Radium exposure would have on their health. When many of these dial painting employees began having serious medical issues....chronic mouth infections, loose teeth, disintegrating jaw bones, tumors, and even death....their employers turned a blind eye. They refused to take responsibility for the work-related illnesses and deaths. Several studies were done that refuted claims that radium was the cause of the illnesses. It took years of fighting and public outcry for life-saving regulations to be put in place to protect workers from this scale of work related injury and blatant disregard for employee health and safety. This book is well-written and an enjoyable read. It tells the tale of these bright, happy young women who were so excited to have a high paying, fun job...but who often paid a high price for working with radium. They were risking their lives for $17.50 (about $242 today) a week, and didn't even know it. When dentists starting noticing multiple women with crumbling jaw bones and chronic mouth infections, it took years for the cause to be traced back to radium. Rather than putting their employees health at the forefront, the employers involved chose to hide the facts so they could continue to make money. The women, injured by exposure to Radium, had to fight to have their story heard, and it led to work place safety regulations to prevent similar exposure to future workers. They were courageous and fought for what they knew was right. This book is horrifying and haunting, yet compelling. I'm glad the stories of these women and what they endured isn't being lost to time. It was 100 years ago now, but their fight for justice shouldn't be forgotten. Lovely and informative read. I highly recommend it!"}, {"userName": "Dorie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16912659-dorie", "userReview": "This is the first non fiction book I\u2019ve read in a long time and it is a good one. I had never read anything about the tragedy that consumed a large number of young women working with radium, painting dials on clocks and other instrument panels.In the beginning radium was actually being hailed as a \u201chealth wonder\u201d but it was soon discovered by many of the scientists working with radium that it could indeed be very dangerous. The young women took these jobs, offered by large factories, because they paid well and they were assured that there was nothing harmful in the paint that they were using. The most horrible part of the story was the telling that most of the girls actually put the brushes in their mouths to get a pointed tip to make their painting more precise! The manufacturer\u2019s deliberately withheld the information about the danger of this method of painting even when there were girls already having terrible side effects from the radium. Their bodies started to fall apart, many of them with jaw bone disintegration, others with symptoms in other bones in their bodies. This went on for a decade with information withheld, no assistance with medical bills, etc. and women dying from the complications. In the end some of them finally received justice but of course it was too late for many of the women.This book is obviously meticulously researched and much time taken to delve into the stories of many individual girls. The problem I had with the reading was that there were simply so many women and the book wasn\u2019t really told in a very linear fashion so that I began to forget which woman had what symptoms, what their doctors had done, etc. I found this confusing and I think I would have preferred that the author narrow the number of victims down to a smaller number in order to keep the information and stories flowing in a more readable format.I appreciate the information that I learned from this book and would recommend it to fans of non fiction.

It made me cry for the girls who were so brave, so sick, and so dedicated to one another so that the truth would be known. It made me cry for the greed that men, doctors and lawyers showed for these girls to let them suffer so while knowing the dangers of the substance they were working with. It made me cry to think of parents deprived of their daughters, children deprived of their mothers, and husbands deprived of their wives. It made me cry to think of the evil and greed the pursuit of money breeds in our culture. It made me cry to think that there were men who willingly and knowingly had no respect for human life. Perhaps there is no fitting way to give justice to these girls and their families. However, Ms Moore, in telling their stories, did an excellent job of portraying for us the real pain, the real courage, and the real people, young girls really, who were a part of this company whose job it was to paint radium infused paint unto clocks and watches. Most apparent through the telling is the complete and utter disregard for these women and the horrible nature of the diseases caused by radium and what it did to their bodies. There was no sense of dignity put forth by the company who employed them. The Radium Dial Company was in a word despicable and one hopes that those, the men who oversaw the girls, the doctors who lied about their condition, and the lawyers who defended the horrendous actions of a company they well knew was lying, and who disavowed the girls' deteriorating conditions by the most despicable of ways are currently burning in hell. This book illuminates the things that were done to American workers in the twenties, particularly the women. It points out the enormous gratitude that must come from we who have come after these girls and now work in conditions that have been made eminently better through their sacrifice, courage, and determination. Thank you to Ms Moore for writing a book about the girls and their struggles. It is well worth the time one has to read this remarkable book written about remarkable women who did give their lives in such awful and painful ways. It is a tribute to them and a story that should be told and never be forgotten."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz", "userReview": "Here's another nonfiction book that reads as quickly and easily as a mystery. After a quick prologue about the Curies, the book begins in earnest in 1917 at the watch dial painting factory. What first struck me was that these girls truly were girls, mostly in their teens. Schooling beyond the elementary grades wasn't something the working classes could afford. The book gives a great account not only of the limits of science, but also the limits and willingness of government agencies to pursue employee safety. It provides a strong reminder of where we might be returning to, given the current administration. This is a sad, heart wrenching tale. These women were repeatedly told lies and dealt with coverups. And it wasn't just their problems. Like a stone thrown in the pond, the rings of destruction made their way through entire families, putting many in the poor house as they struggled with overwhelming medical bills. But there is a heartwarming aspect to the book as well. While there are plenty of villains, there were also plenty of heroines and heroes, who fought for justice for the Radium Girls.  A well told story and one that I strongly recommend."}, {"userName": "Vicki", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8085705-vicki", "userReview": "I had never heard of the radium girls I had seen the glowing green dials of clocks when I was a girl.

I also had no clue that girls, teenage girls had risked and lost their lives painting the numbers with a radium based paste to provide that glow. This well researched book tells of the women that faced an agonizing death because of the companies dishonesty and cold refusal to protect these women.

So be warned this book is not for the faint of heart and while the bravery of these young ladies is certainly inspirational, the anger and frustration I felt about their untimely and excruciating deaths left me feeling emotionally and physically exhausted. The author has obviously done meticulous research about the women who worked for the Radiant Dial Corporation and the United States Radium Corporation beginning in 1917. The practice of \u2018dip, lip, paint\u2019, which was encouraged by the factory, to prevent waste, and to give the brush a sharper point, but exposed the women, who painted luminous dials on watches, with deadly radium. The factories were so popular, due to the wages, which were well above average, and because of the \u2018glow\u2019 the women had due to the radium exposure, which they were assured was perfectly safe. Some of the women even painted the substance onto their faces to see themselves glow in the dark. Five women in particular stood out, as they battled what was termed \u2018occupational diseases\u2019, taking their case to court, but there were many more. The court cases were long, hard fought, and had many disappointments before all was said and done. It was a hard battle which lasted for many years, but the effects lingered on for these ladies\u2019 offspring, for years to come. But, the author really excelled at bringing these women to life, giving them a voice, so to speak. All these women were so very young, so full of life and hope. To hear, in horrific detail, their pain and suffering made for some very difficult reading. Catherine Wolfe Donohoe is one that stood out for me, with her loyal husband, Tom. The suffering these women endured, was gruesome and unimaginable. Again, I warn you, this material is very graphic, and the author drives this point home with such vividness, I swear my joints and teeth ached. This is a battle that waged for many years, with the factories refusing to accept that the radium was dangerous, then trying to hide that it was dangerous, by any means. This is a painful story, one that highlights greed and deceit, but also proves what can happen if you stand up for yourself, speak out, and refuse to give up. The women featured here saved countless lives, while giving their own. This is a powerful, gut wrenching story, and it\u2019s one that has played out in various forms, since the years highlighted here, with various companies hiding dangers or releasing flawed products onto an unsuspecting public. These women should never be forgotten and their bravery should set a shining example for anyone who may find themselves in a similar situation. You never know, you may, like the women featured in this book, bring about new standards of health and safety, expose dangers, and force accountability on those only concerned about their own bottom line. Bravo to Madeline Piller, whose championed these ladies by raising funds for a bronze statue honoring these brave women.

These were manufactured by painting the faces of the devices with compounds containing the radioactive element radium. At the time, the dangers of fissionable elements was unknown, and - in fact - radium was touted as a boon to good looks and good health.After the war - in the 1920s - large factories sprang up to feed the growing demand for the gauges, watches, and 'wellness products' containing radium. The two companies at the center of this story are the United States Radium Corporation (USRC) of New Jersey, and the Radium Dial Company of Ottowa, Illinois. The factories paid well, and young women flocked to work there. During training, the girls were told to put the delicate paintbrushes in their mouths between applications - to form a fine tip. This 'lip, dip, paint.....lip, dip, paint' went on all day, every day - for weeks, months, years. Sadly, the girls were slowly poisoning themselves with radium - but they didn't know it. Unlike nuclear fallout, which causes severe radiation burns (and often death) rather quickly, radium works subtly and slowly. Because radium is chemically similar to calcium, it replaces that element in the bones. The radium builds up over time, until the bones literally fall apart. Moreover, the radioactivity emitted damages other tissues and organs. As a result, several years after they started working at the watch factories, the 'radium girls' began to fall ill, exhibiting some of the most horrendous symptoms imaginable. Often, the women would lose their teeth first, then their jaw bones would rot - resulting in holes in the palate and face. Frequently, the victims developed limps, and - in one case - a woman's legs became permanently crossed, so she couldn't walk. Tumors might develop, sometimes so large that the patient was confined to bed - in unendurable pain. The autopsy of one dead victim showed fractured ribs, holes in the skull, and necrosis (cell death) in the skull vault, pelvis, and many other bones. In fact, there were widespread skeletal changes throughout the body.Some radium girls - if they were able to conceive - suffered miscarriages. And those women who had children were often too sick and weak to care for them. In addtion, there was always the danger of secondary infections, like pneumonia. Sadly, radium poisoning is not curable and - especially back then - effective treatments were unknown. Thus many of these women died terrible deaths. And most of them were in their twenties!Perhaps the worst thing of all, the companies knew radium was dangerous and hid this fact from everyone. In fact, company honchos out and out lied, advertising radium as healthful....'it'll put roses in your cheeks.' \"The Radium Girls\" focuses on several young women who fought back against the watch companies, suing for compensation and medical bills. In an author's note, Kate Moore explains that previous books on the subject focused on the legal and scientific aspects of the cases. Moore, on the other hand, wanted to showcase \"real women standing up for their rights with strength, dignity, and courage\" - and she does an admirable job.Moore thoroughly researched her subject, and unearthed many details about the lives of the affected women. The author captures their excitement at landing 'good jobs'' in the watch plants; the fashionable clothes they purchased with their salaries; the men they dated - and the fun they had. The girls were thrilled that their clothing, covered with radium-containing dust, would shine in the night.....making a spectacular impression on everyone around. Some adventurous gals even decorated their nails and lips with the radium paint. In retrospect, of course, this was a terrible idea! Moore goes on to write about the young ladies' betrothals and marriages..... and then the inevitable devastation to parents, siblings, husbands (and sometimes children) when their bodies fell apart. When some of the victims banded together to file lawsuits against USRC and Radium Dial, the legal machinations by the factories - who adamantly denied responsibility for the girls' illnesses - were so devious, underhanded, and downright disgusting that the factory owners deserve a place in the lowest depths of hell (figuratively speaking). The radium companies co-opted dentists, doctors, lawyers, so-called experts, factory managers, and so on - to cheat, lie, and steal. In one case, a physician swiped the jawbone of a girl being autopsied, so it couldn't be tested for radium poisoning. When the companies were found liable in court - and ordered to pay compensation to the sick women - they appealed again and again and again....in one case, all the way to the Supreme Court. Of course all this dragged on for many years, and it seems the radium companies were hoping the women would die. This book was very distressing to read - so disturbing In fact, that I had to take periodic breaks. The dismissive and uncaring stance of the guilty parties is almost incomprehensible, and they did it all for profit! And later on, when the companies were ordered to clean up the defunct factory sites, which seethed with radioactivity, they refused (or contributed a token few dollars). Unbelievable!Since this is history, I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the valiant battle of the brave women outlined in this story resulted in changes to the laws, and stronger safeguards for employees in the workplace. This is a sad but fascinating story. The book is thorough, well-written, and compelling, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.

The girls, some as young as fourteen, were in charge of painting dial numbers on watch faces and other products. Radium was hailed as miracle product and its luminocity stood out, quite literally. In the 1920's, this was the it job. It was glamorous. It payed well. It was even fun. It was also deadly. The girls did not know that everytime they put the brush in their mouth, they were introducing poison into their body. As time went by, they got sick and suffered terribly. Not willing to back down, they went after the company that assured them that radium was safe. It was to be a long and difficult fight.WOW! I do not even know where to start. This work was brillantly researched and written. Touching, thoughtful, eye-opening and shocking this is one the the finest books I have come across. Radium was considered a novel product, used in everything from toys & nightlights to cosmetic products & medicines. Because of its luminocity, it was particularly useful to the military. Watches, dashboards and most anything that had numbers were done with radium. Because the company assured the public that radium was safe, there was no shortage of girls that wanted to work in the factory (though they called it a \"studio\"). When the US entered the war, demand for radium-painted products boomed and so did the need for a larger (female) work force. With time though, all these women became sick, lost teeth, lost mobility and even developed severe anemia and cancer. The company denied any wrong-doing. They said radium, if anything, should give them \"rosy cheeks\". Still, these brave group of women did not back down and fought. As their health declined, their determination increased and it payed off in the end.I am gobsmaked that the Radium Luminous Materials Corporation got away with murder for as long as they did. They threw their influence, money and lawyers at every attempt of these women to try and discredit the company. They mocked them, disrespected them, said they were hysterical and questioned their motives. Even as these women became living corpses, they kept insisting it was not radium that had caused them that harm. As its known now, radium is radioactive and highly toxic. Its a gift that keeps on giving too for new ailments can appear at any moment. The sacrifice, fight, courage and determination of these women is nothing short of admirable. They never backed down. Even bedridden they never stopped and I can not think of a braver act. I cheered when the final veredict came it and also cried (a lot). Their contributions span a wide range. New safety precautions were introduced in the workplace, the dangers of radioactivity became known on a world wide scale, laws changed to protect the workers and so much more. All because these women never gave up. From the bottom of my heart, thanks so much ladies!

The book takes us into their workplaces, where they laughed and gossiped while painting watch dials with luminous, radium-based paint. At the time, radium was already known to be dangerous, at least in scientific circles. Somewhat paradoxically it was also touted as miracle cure-all, sold in tonics and expensive spa treatments.Of course the radium in the paint would eventually work its way into the women's bones, destroying their bodies from within. The havoc it wreaked is truly horrifying, made that much worse by the protracted legal battles they endured in an effort to obtain compensation from the companies that had employed them.The author's focus is on the women themselves: their personalities, their experiences, their suffering and long battle for justice. The style is deliberately biographical, rather than scientific (I personally would have appreciated a little chemistry refresher, just for some context, but that can easily be found elsewhere). Moore has done mountains of research, and in order to do justice to each one of these individual women, she pours details on to the page with great empathy. At times the sheer volume of biographical detail makes it hard to keep track, the many victims begin to blur together and the writing becomes repetitive. The court room scenes come alive however, rife with emotion and lawyerly dramatics. My favourite sections were the epilogue and post-script, where the scope widened to include the women's legacy to science and to occupational safety. I wished these sections had been expanded and formed a larger part of the book.

Because, in a book about children and young people working in factories and being poisoned by radium, the last thing I care about is how pretty they were. \n[Katherine Schaub] was an attractive girl of just fourteen; her fifteenth birthday was in five weeks\u2019 time. Standing just under five foot four, she was \u201ca very pretty little blonde\u201d with twinkling blue eyes, fashionably bobbed hair, and delicate features. *As time went on, she got to know her colleagues better. One was Josephine Smith, a sixteen-year-old girl with a round face, brown bobbed hair, and a snub nose.*[Grace Fryer] was an exceptionally bright and exceptionally pretty girl, with curly chestnut hair, hazel eyes, and clear-cut features. Many called her striking, but her looks weren\u2019t of much interest to Grace.* [Edna Bolz] was nicknamed the \u201cDresden Doll\u201d because of her beautiful golden hair and fair coloring; she also had perfect teeth and, perhaps as a result, a beaming smile.*[Hazel Vincent] had an oval face with a button nose and fair hair that she set in the latest styles.*[Albina Maggia] was a somewhat round and diminutive woman of only four foot eight, with classic Italian dark hair and eyes.*[Mollie Maggia] was a sociable nineteen-year-old with a broad face and bouffant brown hair.*Ella [Eckert] was popular and good-looking, with blond, slightly frizzy hair and a wide smile.*[Quinta Maggia] was an extremely attractive woman with large gray eyes and long dark hair; she considered her pretty teeth her best feature.\nThese descriptions go on and on every time a new woman is introduced (and sometimes men are described the same way). I suppose Moore thinks it makes them more relatable. And, based on the number of five star reviews, she may be right. But it didn't work for me.The vast amount of information was a bit much, and I didn't bother to keep track of every single person, I just sort of surfed along the top - it's great that Moore did her research thoroughly, but I didn't need to hear about every detail. (And don't try to eat lunch while reading this! There's a lot of pus exploding and bones disintegrating right out of their bodies ...) I never stopped being annoyed by the insistence on describing the young women's appearance - as if what happened to them was more awful because they started out so pretty. I kept reading, I just did my best to skip over all the rest of the detailed appearance descriptions.The writing was perhaps more appropriate to an American Girl novel:\nBut it was the same thing affecting all the girls. It was radium, heading straight for their bones\u2014yet, on its way, seeming to decide, almost on a whim, where to settle in the greatest degree. And so some women felt the pain first in their feet; in others, it was in their jaw; in others still their spine. It had totally foxed their doctors. But it was the same cause in all of them. In all of them, it was the radium.\nIt. Had. Totally. Foxed. Their. Doctors. Like, totally.But I soldiered on. I grew up just a bit south from Newark and Orange, NJ, and it's always interesting to learn more about the area.The writing never improved. Moore regularly makes assumptions about the thoughts and feelings of the women, which is fine in a novelization, but feels unprofessional here:\nAs Catherine set Tommy down on a rug and watched him play, her mind went over her appointment.\nNow, come ON. There is no way this was recorded. No one knows what Catherine was thinking in that moment.Additionally, some odd language is used, almost childish at times:\nPearl started bleeding continuously, down below.\n\"Down below\"? We can't say \"vagina\" now? And, perhaps most irritating of all (well, of all except Moore's bizarre fondness for repetition - THAT was really irritating!) is the choice to end many (most? all? I don't care enough to go back and check) chapters on a cliffhanger:\nTom was now in the hands of State Attorney Elmer Mohn, facing two criminal charges.\nDun-dun-DUNNNNNN .... Is this the latest James Patterson? Continue to the next chapter to find out what happens to Tom!This passage in the second section jumped out at me:\nHe told one worker, Katherine Moore, on eight separate occasions that there was not a single trace of radium in her body. She later died from radium poisoning.\nYou would think the author, Kate Moore, would comment on the name, but she does not. Is this a distant relation? We will never know.A rather egregious error does make me wonder about how accurate all of Moore's other assertions are:\n\u201c[ I] understood,\u201d said Grace\u2019s physician Dr. McCaffrey, who\u2019d arranged her examination with Flinn, \u201cthat Dr. Flinn was an MD.\u201d But now, when Berry asked the authorities to look into exactly who Flinn was, he received the following letter from the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners: \u201cOur records do not show the issuance of a license to practice medicine and surgery or any branch of medicine and surgery to Frederick B. Flinn.\u201d Flinn was not a medical doctor. His degree was in philosophy. He was, as the Consumers League put it, \u201ca fraud of frauds.\u201d\nThat made me wonder, so I used The Google and quickly found that Flinn had a PhD in Industrial Hygiene, so while he was surely a two-faced shyster, he was not wholly unqualified. His degree was not \"in philosophy.\" Moore seems to have confused a \"PhD\" (short for Philosophiae Doctor, or Doctor of Philosphy) with a doctorate degree in philosophy. Yikes. That's an embarrassing mistake for an author! And where are her fact checkers?? I mean, I'm NoName Nancy here, not even reading carefully, and I noticed it! This is an important story, and I'm glad it's been told, I just wish it wasn't told this way.I found this 35 page article online, originally published in the 1997 Missouri Law Review, and I recommend it as an alternative, if you want to be informed yet avoid this particular pile of excess verbiage entirely: The New Jersey Radium Dial Workers and the Dynamics of Occupational Disease Litigation in the Early Twentieth Century.My advice: read the Missouri Law Review article, read the epilogue and post script of Radium Girls, and call it a day. The rest of the book is just ... not good.If you want to read a novelization based on other historical events in Paterson NJ (not about radium), I recommend: Girl Waits with Gun.N.B.: Do NOT listen to the audio version of this book, it's terrible. (And I love audiobooks.). I noped my way out of that audiobook faster than you can say \"radium poisoning,\" and switched to the ebook to finish.Word count: number of times \"Lip, dip, paint\" (or variant \"lip, dip\") appears: 11 (including twice in the endnotes). I started feeling very stabby every time I saw it. Lip ... Dip ... Fuck off."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn", "userReview": "Although, as a scientist myself who has worked with radioisotopes, I had heard of the women workers who died as a result of painting radium on clock and instrument dials in the 1920s, I wasn't prepared for the sheer horror of the story that unfolds in this book. It wasn't just the naivety of the girls and their bosses with regard to the dangers of radium that shocked me but the way the corporations lied to the girls when the dangers were recognised and women were dying tragic and painful deaths at a young age.Discovered in 1898 by the Curies, radium was hailed as a great cure for shrinking tumours and was thought to be beneficial for health and vitality. It was added to cosmetics and even medicines to treat all manner of ills and promoted as a health giving tonic. In 1917, a watch dial company in New Jersey started to use it to paint the dials of watches and clocks so that they could be read in the dark. With the start of WWI this was expanded to ship and later plane dials and the factory hired hundreds of young women to do the painting. The women were taught to paint the fine lines on the dials by a technique called 'lip pointing'. Using a fine brush they would dip it in the radium paint, draw the brush to a fine point with their lips and then paint the line of the dial: \"lip, dip, paint\". At first the girls were allowed to rinse the brushes in water but this was later discouraged as radium was lost in the wash water and it was too expensive to waste, so the girls would \"lip, dip, paint\" and repeat over and over again. The radium dust was also all over the workplace, on the benches where they ate their lunches, in their hair and in their clothes. The workers were known as the 'Shining Girls' because they literally shone in the dark. In the 1920s, Mollie Maggia was the first of the girls, but not the last, to start losing her teeth and eventually her jaw bone also disintegrated and was removed. Dentists and doctors were puzzled by the nature of her illness and her eventual death was listed as syphilis even there was no evidence for this (or even evidence that she had ever been sexually active). Other girls then began to fall ill. Developing anemia, losing teeth and jawbones, developing painful joints and hips, experiencing stillbirths. Later on sarcomas started to appear on those who survived long enough. All through this the radium corporations told the girls that radium could not be responsible and was perfectly safe. Eventually the girls would find a champion in lawyer Leonard Grossman who worked tirelessly to bring the corporations to account and change the laws surrounding Industrial occupational hazards forever.This is an amazing story, meticulously researched and investigated by Kate Moore, telling the personal stories of many of the women and their families who fought to be heard, often from their hospital beds. There were almost too many tragic stories of the many young women employed by the radium companies that I felt I was suffering from emotional overload in the middle of the book but once it moved into the women's fight for recognition of the damage done to them and their families and the sheer bravery exhibited by them I was totally enthralled by their battle for justice and was cheering them on.With thanks to Netgalley and the publisher Sourcebooks for a copy to read and review"}], "description": "The incredible true story of the women who fought America's Undark danger\nThe Curies' newly discovered element of radium makes gleaming headlines across the nation as the fresh face of beauty, and wonder drug of the medical community. From body lotion to tonic water, the popular new element shines bright in the otherwise dark years of the First World War.Meanwhile, hundreds of girls toil amidst the glowing dust of the radium-dial factories. The glittering chemical covers their bodies from head to toe; they light up the night like industrious fireflies. With such a coveted job, these \"shining girls\" are the luckiest alive \u2014 until they begin to fall mysteriously ill.But the factories that once offered golden opportunities are now ignoring all claims of the gruesome side effects, and the women's cries of corruption. And as the fatal poison of the radium takes hold, the brave shining girls find themselves embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of America's early 20th century, and in a groundbreaking battle for workers' rights that will echo for centuries to come. Written with a sparkling voice and breakneck pace, The Radium Girls fully illuminates the inspiring young women exposed to the \"wonder\" substance of radium, and their awe-inspiring strength in the face of almost impossible circumstances. Their courage and tenacity led to life-changing regulations, research into nuclear bombing, and ultimately saved hundreds of thousands of lives...", "title": "The Radium Girls: The Dark Story of America's Shining Women", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31409135-the-radium-girls", "average": 4.23, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1496007867l/31409135.jpg", "reviews": 4229, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16150223.Kate_Moore", "name": "Kate  Moore"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "History", "Science", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31409135-the-radium-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31437975-the-radium-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34394482-the-radium-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27221256-the-radium-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32510573-felix-the-railway-cat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34435216-the-radium-girls-excerpt"]}
