I believe that you can describe most novels that are written under the title of 'Love Inspired.' I would like to read more novels by Ms. Davids in the near future so that I can get a strong feel for her writings. Katie Lantz is a young woman who drifted from the Amish faith for she thought that a greater life was waiting for her outside of her controlling community. Pregnant and returning home, Katie realizes that the life she had been looking for was just a fairy tale without the happy ending. Unfortunately, when the van driver pulls up to what used to be her old home, she had the rude awakening that her family was no longer residing there. Elam Sutter and his mother lived together in an older home and worked the land as many of the good Amish do. Mr. Sutter could not have been more surprised than to wake up one morning to find a pregnant woman, that was not his wife, on his door step in need of a place to stay. With no money, nothing for the child, and no where to go- Katie was forced to impose herself on their hospitality until her child was born. Can God take the past of these two different individuals, and bring them together in a new and loving way? Can God make a family where there seems to be no hope for one? Softening hearts and changing minds is something that our Heavenly Father is excellent in, and this story does a beautiful job and portraying those characteristics."}, {"userName": "Paula-O", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3327000-paula-o", "userReview": "this is a wonderful amish story by Patricia Davids \"Katie's Redemption\". Katie really had a hard life from the time she was born, she was in a fire that killed most of her family at a very young age and an older brother raised her, He was a very strict man and she did not know much love even though she grew up in an amish comunity where Love always abounds. She was ennamored by a young english man she met when he visited in the comunity when she was a teenager and she left with him thinking this was Love. He abandoned her when she became pregnant and she made her way back to the amish comunity hoping her brother would forgive her and she could have the baby. Upon arriving in a bad stormy night she found someone living in the old homestead and brother gone to another state.A young man and his Mom lived together and when they saw the state Katie was in they let her stay with them for awhile and it was here that Katie finally found Love....."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7210336-terri", "userReview": "Katie's Redemption is a typical Amish-themed, Christian romance. It is very well-written with no glaring editorial issues. There are, however, a few \"Amish\" issues. Perhaps it is a difference between the Amish that the author is familiar with and the Amish that I am familiar with. Despite that issue, I would definitely recommend this book. I really liked the character development of this book. Not only did the author develop the characters well as the story progressed, but she very adequately portrayed the characters' internal development, their desire for and path towards growth. As others have said, the story is \"sweet\", but it manages to avoid the syrupy, sickly-sweet tone that sometime plagues christian romances. Overall, it was very well done!"}, {"userName": "Collene", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2403762-collene", "userReview": "I was really impressed with the writing.

Nine months pregnant, she takes a bus to her brother\u2019s house, prepared to do and say whatever is necessary to find a home. Elam Sutter and his family moved to Ohio to find cheap farmland, and to get away from the rumors surrounding their family back in Pennsylvania. Elam is stunned when a young very pregnant English woman stands on his front porch, looking for her brother. Her brother had moved to Kansas. When Katie goes into labor upon hearing the news Elam\u2019s mother offers shelter, against Elam\u2019s better judgment. Katie is determined to leave as soon as she is well enough, but when her brother refuses to take her in, she doesn\u2019t know what to do. What will it take for Katie to find the family and love she\u2019s always longed for. KATIE\u2019S REDEMPTION is the first book I read by this author. I really didn\u2019t have to review it, but since I have a slot and I took the time to read it I might as well. \uf04a The story does start out a bit slow, but it does pick up as it continues. Katie is struggling with who she is and where she belongs. She never really fit into the Amish world, and her brother who raised her was very cruel, blaming her for losing his home and the rest of his family. So, it was understandable that she took the opportunity to leave home when she got it. But it was also understandable that with no place to go, home would be the first place she thought of. If you are looking for a shorter Amish story which is pure romance, then KATIE\u2019S REDEMPTION might be the book for you. The author\u2019s letter suggests that she has several other Amish themed books coming soon from Love Inspired. Discussion questions are available at the back of the book. Available from www.steeplehill.com or from www.amazon.com. $5.50. 214 pages."}, {"userName": "Cayla", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22154154-cayla", "userReview": "This was a lovely read and I'm very glad I downloaded it! Katie is a sweet girl who desperately wants to make amends---to be accepted again into the community that she left. After a long absence, she returns to her brother's house only to find that he no longer lives there. Nine months pregnant and unmarried, this is not the best kind of scenario to return home under as Amish families have very strict beliefs.Katie feels awkward (and probably awful too!) for suddenly intruding into the home of strangers while in search for her brother. She wants to leave, but she is unable to as her labor starts that same evening. Now that she has a baby to think about, Katie has to make choices about her future and how she wants to raise her daughter.The Sutter family have taken her in. Elam Sutter seems to be in love with her already and willing to raise the child with her. His mother is baby-crazy. She wants Elam to know the joys of having a family and seems to think well enough of Katie, despite her past mistakes. Katie has to decide what she wants now: a life with Elam, a life without Elam, or a life different than the one she knows. In a sense, I believe this book is not just about redemption, but is about the journey one takes to learn from the past, embrace and appreciate the present, and prepare for the future."}, {"userName": "Jess F.
