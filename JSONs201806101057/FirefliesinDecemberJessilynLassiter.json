I know that makes me somewhat of an emotional reviewer, making allowances for horrible plot-holes because \u201cthe characters were just so wonderful\u201d but I will freely admit to it. This book, however, was not one in which I make allowances for problems with plot and pacing because of my love for the characters. This book, with its wonderful cast of realistic characters, also had a perfectly paced, tightly crafted plot. And I loved it. I loved every second of it. Valent\u2019s depiction of the south in the summer of 1932 and the racial prejudice that existed during that time was well done. Having already read the Shiloh Legacy (a trilogy by Brock and Bodie Thoene) I thought that this seemed, not necessarily watered down, but much milder. Still, it was believable, and that\u2019s what counts in my book. Secondly, oh my goodness, the characters. I didn\u2019t rate this book for the characters alone, as stated above, but oh\u2026how I loved them! They were amazing. The way they interacted was funny and understandable. Valent has an understanding for human behavior that impressed me very much. Jessie is a little tomboy, gradually growing into a woman. There were moments when she very much reminded me of a slightly older version of Scout Finch. (Not to mention that I may be just a teensy weensy bit in love with Luke Talley. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s six years older than Jessie, they must end up together! MUST, I SAY!). Thirdly, the Christian message. It was done perfectly. It wasn\u2019t preachy or overdone, it was just softly woven in and I loved that. I always cringe when Christianity comes over too loudly in a novel and just ends up seeming cheesy. This book gets it right. Jessie isn\u2019t a Christian, but she believes that God exists. She just hasn\u2019t seen a need in her life for repentance. I like when she\u2019s locked in a shed, afraid she\u2019s going to die and she says, \u201cBut even as I sat in that dimly lit shed, I wasn\u2019t asking for salvation of my soul. I was asking for salvation of my body.\u201d Sometimes I think we all lose sight of the fact that it\u2019s not our body that will last for an eternity, it\u2019s our souls. \u201cJessilyn, ain\u2019t no man can\u2019t get someplace he never thought he\u2019d get to. You let enough bad thoughts into your head, you can end up doin\u2019 all sorts of things you never thought possible. [\u2026] We best be on our guard and keep our minds on what\u2019s right and true so we don\u2019t become things we\u2019ll regret.\u201dI\u2019m so happy my birthday is coming up soon, and I\u2019ll probably get at least one Barnes & Noble gift card which I can \u201cblow\u201d on Cottonwood Whispers and Catching Moondrops. I must have them. I should buy the actual books, rather than the ebooks. But I get ebooks instantly, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to wait an extra week waiting for the physical books to get to me. But yeah, these books are worth buying the real thing. They\u2019re phenomenal."}, {"userName": "Katie  Hanna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53581393-katie-hanna", "userReview": "Man, reading this book made me feel hot. I literally mean that. It made me feel HOT. It's set in southern Virginia in the 1930s (ergo: pre-air-conditioning), and it takes place in the summertime; and I'm not kidding when I say every single chapter comes up with some new and inventive way of mentally re-creating the \"steam bath\" that is Deep South weather. Really good descriptions. Very atmospheric. I liked that. I also loved the interactions between the characters--particularly Jessie and Gemma, and then again Jessie and Luke. Gemma is like the sensible older sister, the responsible kid who has to be yelling at Jessie every other minute to not do whatever it is she's doing (CAN I GET AN AMEN HERE); and Luke is adorable!!! \"You and me, we gotta talk.\" \"What for?\" \"WHAT FOR?!?\" Yep, I loved him. The author did an excellent job making it clear how much he liked Jessie, without letting him seem at all creepy for it (I mean, sure, he's older than her; but it all stayed very innocent and appropriate and I appreciated this). I'm really looking forward to seeing more of them as a couple later in the series [even though my library doesn't have the rest of the books--DARN YOU, LIBRARY.]The one thing I really didn't like was the fact that parts of this book made it feel like it was modeled after \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"? Like, I definitely understand that any story about racial violence in the Deep South in the 30's is going to have some broad similarities; but I just felt like the similarities were a little too strong here . . . Jessie's overall personality, the courtroom scene, Miss Cleta, the violent confrontation at the end, etc. And maybe I wouldn't have been so bothered by that if TKAM wasn't my 3rd-favorite book of all time; but as it is, I'm kind of sensitive on this point. (Sorry, guys . . . I mean, you've seen my profile picture and all . . . :-P) So yeah. Overall, though, I thought this was a really good story; especially for Christian historical fiction, which (as you all know) is a genre of which I am not terribly fond. And I'm definitely interested in checking out more of the series and seeing how my ship turns out (Luke + Jessie forever <3)"}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1256262-ron", "userReview": "A great story, well-developed. Were it not for the obvious parallels to that novel, this story has the potential of being the To Kill a Mockingbird of our day. That and the many anachronisms.If there was a 3.5 rating, I'd give it but gave this debut novel the benefit of the split.The anachronisms. Supposedly set in the rural south the Summer of 1932, the heroines isolated farm house featured electricity, indoor bathrooms, locking windows, electric lights and a liberal use of battery-powered flashlights. The feel--even including the role of the Ku Klux Klan and the Federal involvement against it--spoke more of the 50s or 60s.The few times she gave sufficient details about the farming, she betrayed her ignorance of that subject also.Lest readers disbelieve thirteen-year-olds could be so stupid and willful, I suggest remembering oneself at that age.Note: despite the protagonist being a thirteen-year-old girl, this is not suitable reading for children. It probably is appropriate for teens.Don't let these negatives dissuade you. This is an excellent book.

She's just turned thirteen and she finds trouble, or trouble finds her, just about every time she opens her mouth. Her best friend is Gemma, a slightly older African-American girl whose family lives on her daddy's farm. All is as it should be in the south in the 30s, including segregation of the races, and everyone knows their place in the world. That is until a freak lightning strike from a thunderstorm kills Gemma's parents, leaving her orphaned and alone in the world. The Lassiters take Gemma into their home as a member of their family, and thus starts the insanity of bigotry and hate delivered by friends and neighbors. Even now, nearly two generations later, I can't grasp why anyone would treat other human beings with such disdain, fear and hate. Is it because I was raised in Kansas, where the fight to be admitted as a free-state made bleeding headlines in national newspapers in the 1850s? Or because I grew up with civil rights already a fact, albeit not equally applied, but definitely a step further down the road to freedom and tolerance. This is a good first novel for Jennifer Valent. I struggled a bit with the amount of dialog, and the southern colloquialisms, and I was breathless most of the time trying to keep up with a headstrong impulsive foolish thirteen year-old girl with more guts than sense."}, {"userName": "Lynn Spencer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11488136-lynn-spencer", "userReview": "Though marketed as adult fiction, this is really more a coming-of-age novel than anything else. The heroine, Jessilyn Lassiter, has had a somewhat sheltered childhood is rural Virginia. However, in 1932, Jessilyn turns 13, and things really change. Gemma, the daughter of a black couple employed by the Lassiters, is the sole survivor of a fire and after she loses her parents, Jessilyn's father declares that he will take in Gemma and raise her as his own.Not surprisingly for the time, this decision unleashes a complete firestorm. Reactions from the locals range from kindness to ostracism to outright violent hatred. Through it all, Jessilyn and Gemma remain friends, but the trials faced by the family open Jessilyn's eyes to the real ugliness of racism and prejudice. On the one hand, this book was a really eye-opening read that told a much less sanitized than usual version(at least way less sanitized than anything I learned in school) of segregation history. The book is told in first person through Jessilyn's eyes, and she is a very convincing 13 year old who is sometimes wise and sometimes immature beyond anything I'd like to remember about myself at that age.While this book had some very good points, it also had some real rough spots,too. Most of the dialogue employs a southern dialect that makes for frustrating reading. The setting of the book, Calloway County, is not a real county in Virginia, but based on the descriptions, it sounds a lot like the Southside region of Virginia. If that's the case, then I'd say the dialect seems accurate for what I've encountered there, but that doesn't make it any easier to plow through as a reader. Parts of the story also feel a little contrived and overly predictable in places, which I found distracting. Lastly, the story also started to drag for me about halfway through, and I think it's because the characterizations seemed a little simplistic. This may be because we saw everything through Jessilyn's eyes (and she's not the most perceptive heroine ever), but it still made for somewhat frustrating reading.Even so, I found this an interesting, if uneven, read. Fireflies in December is inspirational fiction, but most of the inspirational content came from characters speaking of faith and justice in ways that reminded me very much of everyday conversations I've heard in rural Virginia in real life rather than protracted scenes of stilted preaching. One note of caution: This book is grittier than most, and there are some graphic scenes of violence toward people and toward animals that some readers will find upsetting."}, {"userName": "Rap", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2199852-rap", "userReview": "This book tells the story of a 13 year old girl growing up in the segregated south of 1932.

I got to page 147, chapter 13, and decided that this book is just not worth my time to finish. I did read over half of it, so I feel that gives enough insight for a somewhat fair review and rating.Set in the 1930's, Fireflies in December follows the life of a thirteen-year-old girl named Jessilyn who's relationship with her best friend is frowned upon in their society. This is a time and a community deep in racism, with references to the KKK and all the hate and ignorance that goes along with it. This story has been told many times, and while it is a good story to tell (especially for young people), I feel that this particular version was not well written. The characters felt very one-dimensional, and I just didn't like or want to root for the protagonist. To me, this book was simply not interesting. I think it may be better suited for a young adult audience (perhaps that is the target?).

It has been compared to Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, but I honestly think it's better. The sequel is more along the lines of Mockingbird. This one is darker, uglier, with touches of both humor and romance. Think Mockingbird as Tom Sawyer and Fireflies as Huckleberry Finn. The POV of a child makes this honest rather than preachy or melodramatic, be it about racism or faith. I love the interaction between all of the characters: girlfriend to girlfriend, mother to daughter, father to daughter, husband to wife, neighbor to neighbor, girl to boy. Each character has a clear voice, and there is nothing superfluous or generic at all. I love that Luke and Jessie aren't going to be together for a while (but clearly will!)

Jessilyn's family takes her in, however, because she is black, her family is outed by the community. This story is about how they pulled together by faith and what is good and true.

Set in the south and dealing with racism, this book had elements that harkened back to To Kill A Mockingbird in my mind. In both books, I am drawn to the father, and deeply respect his views and how he treats people in his life, including his daughter. The way the author reminds us that we can make a difference, as an individual, to those around us was a prevailing theme shown across multiple characters. A theme I enjoyed. I also appreciated that this was shown both through positive and negative examples. \"Jessilyn, ain't no man can't get someplace he never thought he's get to. You let enough bad thoughts into your head, you can end up doin' all sorts of things you never thought possible. ... We best be on our guard and keep our minds on what's right and true so we don't become things we'll regret.\" Even more powerful than that reminder, for me, was the context behind the title of the book:-------I was tired, and I laid my head back, looked out at the star dotted sky, and sighed. \"Sometimes I don't know what God expects us to do.\"Daddy didn't say anything for a minute or so, and then he reached up and caught a firefly as it glowed beside him. \"See this light?\" he asked me when the firefly lit up his hand.\"Yes'r.\"That light is bright enough to light up a little speck of the night sky so a man can see it a ways away.

Not only is she walking that tenuous line between childhood and womanhood, but during the summer of 1932 Jessilyn finds herself in the crosshairs of man's hatred for his fellow man.When her best friend Gemma's parents are tragically killed in a fire, Jessilyn's father takes the girl in. No matter that she's as dark as coffee and sticks out in their white family like a sheep in a cow field. Harley Lassiter sees people for their hearts, not their skin color. If only the rest of Calloway County felt the same way. Soon Jessilyn is ostracized by whites and blacks alike. This racial mingling \"just ain't done\", and it isn't long before the Lassiter family becomes a target for something much more sinister, and deadly. The Klu Klux Klan.In Fireflies in December Valent has skillfully dropped us into the middle of southern Virginia during a turbulent time in our country's history. Less than seventy years had passed since the Civil War, and unfortunately not everyone embraced its outcome. The Great Depression's talons still clung to many families. \"Things were poor, especially in our parts, and for having a working farm and a good truck, we were fortunate. We even had some conveniences that other people envied, like a fancy icebox and a telephone...\"Fear has a way of bringing out the worst in folks, and perhaps that's why racism was still so prevalent in the south of 1932. As I read this novel, I found myself amazed that such hatred existed. Certainly racism still shows up in today's America, but during the year we've elected our first African-American President it's striking how far we've come.Valent knows how to involve us in the setting. We feel the oppressive humidity of summer and hear the cicadas buzzing. We lie on our backs in bed all day with Jessilyn and Gemma because moving feels like wading through a furnace. And without bogging us down in pages of narrative we understand the anguish Jessilyn suffers when she thinks she killed a man. In fact, Valent could've used more exposition and it wouldn't have detracted. Perhaps it would've added even more depth to this coming-of-age story.Fireflies In December brings to mind the themes and characters of To Kill A Mockingbird. Jessilyn is older than Scout, but just as stubborn. Their fathers stand by what they believe is right, even when everyone else is against them. Jessilyn and Scout both find their lives in danger. However, Valent has a voice and nack for description all her own. Her scenes move quickly, and even if you're not a historical fiction fan you'll find yourself drawn in. People are people, whether it be 1932 or 2003. We all feel pain; we're all searching for meaning. And this becomes clearer as you turn the pages.The spirituality is never heavy-handed, being shown rather than told, for the most part. The Lassiters are practicing Christians, and they talk about that aspect of their lives like they would anything else. But even when Jessilyn's parents do share a spiritual insight with her or talk about Jesus it doesn't feel like a sermon. We're listening, too, and we glean their nuggets of wisdom.Fireflies in December is a tight, finely crafted novel that challenges us to root out any hint of prejudice in our own hearts, whether we're black or white, male or female, rich or poor. That's a message that'll stand the test of time."}, {"userName": "AnJa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4724465-anja", "userReview": "Got this as a free download in my phone's kindle app. A coming-of-age story told through the eyes of a courageous and independent 13 year old white girl.

It may come in different forms: not only between race--between black and white; but also between what we believe, how we worship, how we act, how we look like--thin or fat; ugly or pretty; gay or straight. People branding people, putting each other down, hating each other making this world such a cruel place to live.

I was hooked from the first page and read it in only two days. It was an adjustment to read the stilted Southern accent that all the characters had in the book, but once I got used to it, it was fine. I think this book would be an appropriate class reading project for 7-8th graders, but still has great appeal to an adult as well. It certainly could be likened to the lessons taught in 'To Kill A Mocking Bird'. I found out later that there are two more books in the series.

After all, Gemma is black and the year is 1932--well before the Civil Rights act comes into being. The Lassiters are not prepared for the Ku Klux Klan involvement and a barrage of hate crimes with fatal consequences. In addition to all that, Jessilyn is having trouble just turning into a young woman--first crushes and new dresses and high heels are just as difficult to maneuver at that age as social injustice. At least, it seems that way to Jessilyn. The setting is my favorite--full of oozy Southern drawls and heat just dripping off the page.This one won the 2010 Christy Award and it is well-deserved!

Not exactly profound literature. It's a bit fanciful at times, with underdeveloped characters; the exception being Jessilyn Lassiter, the feisty and strong-willed, thirteen-year-old narrator/protagonist. Another element that could have been more polished is dialogue. Conversations between characters didn't always 'sound' genuine or well-suited to character. Daddy Lassiter sounded like Mamma Lassiter, and vice versa.... If that makes any sense???The story however, set in Virginia during The Depression, does have endearing qualities and strong points.

I had a hard time putting it down. Jessilyn Lassiter is a 13-year-old girl growing up in the south. She's blessed with a loving Christian family. Her best friend is Gemma, the daughter of a couple who help her parents out on their farm. When Gemma's parents are killed during a lightening storm, she comes to live with the Lassiter family. The problem is that Gemma is \"colored\" and the Lassiters are white. This does not sit well with the community. The story is set during the 1930's and the KKK is running rampant in these parts. Jessilyn's life becomes filled with fear as she tries to navigate growing into womanhood, understanding prejudice, finding her own faith and her feelings for the 19-year-old man who treats her like a little sister when she has her sights set on becoming his wife someday. The characters in this book are so endearing, I simply didn't want to say goodbye to them at the end of the story. This is book one of a three part series and I can't wait to read the next book."}, {"userName": "kelley", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2545928-kelley", "userReview": "Fireflies in December takes place in 1932 in South Virginia. Because the Lassiter's have taken in an orphaned black girl whose parents were employed by them their friends and neighbors soon distance themselves. The Lassiter's find themselves victims of several Ku Klux Klan visits. This is a terrifying and troubling experience for all of them.The story is well written. Jessilyn Lassiter is the protagonist of this story and as we follow her story we see how difficult it was living in the south and dealing with racial prejudice. Jessilyn's story recounts vividly how a young victimized girl feels. She tries to appear brave when she is constantly terrified, she makes less than thought out decisions based on her confused emotions. I found myself feeling very strongly attached to the girl.As well as dealing with terrors most of us never have to face, Jessilyn is also experiencing her first love. The love story is sweet and tender, we watch as Jessilyn grows from tomboy to young lady. I really enjoyed this story of courage and tender emotions."}, {"userName": "Michelle Wegner", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4515312-michelle-wegner", "userReview": "This is a wonderful coming of age novel set in the depression era south. The story is told by a 13 year old girl who finds herself in the middle of a KKK war against her family who has chosen to adopt her friend whose parents were both killed. A black girl living with a white family was considered a threat to the \"way things should be\" in their community, and sadly the main character is faced with understanding racism and all its hatred for the first time. The lessons of faith the family learns are ones I want my family to understand as well. We do the right thing no matter what kind of opposition we face. We stand up for those who are cast off or marginalized. We put our faith in God and our family first. With those virtues, we can face any thing that comes our way. This a great read and I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Carol ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/909845-carol", "userReview": "In 1932, Gemma's parents are killed in a house fire so she comes to live with her 13 year old best friend's family.

Seeing that Fireflies in December was a first novel for the author AND written just a couple years ago I was not expecting much, but was genuinely surprised. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.Valent hit a home run with this story. It is set in southern Virginia in the early 1930s so it was a tad reminiscent of To Kill a Mockingbird because the heroine is a young girl and because the story circles around racial tensions in her hometown, but that's where the similarities end. Fireflies in December is a completely unique story and a page turner. I should note that Valent is a Christian so faith is definitely a part of the story, but it is woven in a very real way and is not cheesy or over the top like so many in this genre are. All said and done, I loved this book and I look forward to reading the sequel."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1736332-kelly", "userReview": "A family takes in a young girl of another race after her parents pass away, and open themselves up to being ostricized by an entire town.
