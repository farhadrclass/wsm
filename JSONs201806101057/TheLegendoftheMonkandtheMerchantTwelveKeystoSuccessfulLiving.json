Although I agree with that, and the book makes a few other worthwhile points, I was disappointed to find that it teaches the unbiblical prosperity theology (AKA prosperity gospel, AKA health and wealth gospel). For examples, see Principle 1: \u201cWork Hard and God Will Prosper You\u201d, and Principle 2: \u201cFinancial Prosperity is Connected to Soul Prosperity.\u201d With unbiblical lessons like these, I can\u2019t recommend this book.Although some Bible references are listed at the end of the book, many statements are made without references and without adequate explanation. I realize that it\u2019s meant to be written as an easy-to-read story, but I found it far too shallow.This quote from near the end of the book sums up the main point: \u201cGod has designed a special relationship between businessmen and leaders in the church. We, as businessmen, can provide the provision for the vision of the priests.\u201dParts I liked or agreed with\u2022 \u201cYour vocation is your calling. It\u2019s the thing that you were born to do. And when you do it, it\u2019s not really work at all.\u201d\u2022 \u201cWhen Jesus was talking to the rich young ruler, He was dealing with him specifically, not with everyone generally. Jesus knew that the young man had made an idol out of money, and He wanted the man to be free. He knew that the only way for the many to be free was to get rid of the thing that held him captive.\u201d\u2022 \u201cJesus encountered other men of considerable wealth and never asked them to sell all their things. Zebedee, Zaccheus, Matthew the tax collector, the Roman officer, and Nicodemus, just to name a few.\u201d\u2022 \u201cGod desires for your soul to prosper above all else.\u201d\u2022 Sometimes difficulty means God is closing a door, but more often it means He\u2019s testing our character or preparing us for something.Parts I disliked or disagreed with\u2022 Referring to kingship in Rev. 1:6, the book says, \u201cA king is like a man who runs a business.\u201d I believe the Bible refers to believers as \u201ckings\u201d to show that we rule and will rule with Christ in His kingdom (Luke 22:29, Jam. 2:5, Rev. 5:10, Rev. 22:5, Rev. 2:26-27).\u2022 \u201cPrinciple 1: Work Hard and God Will Prosper You.\u201d\u2022 The book applies Deut 28:1, \u201cGod promises wealth to those people that love Him and keep His commands,\u201d to all Christians.\u2022 The book applies 3 John 2, a letter to Gaius which begins, \u201cBeloved, I wish you prosperity and good health, even as your soul prospers,\u201d to all Christians.\u2022 \u201cUnless He specifically calls you to a vow of poverty, as your relationship with Him grows, then He wants you to prosper financially.\u201d\u2022 The book says that Psalm 37:4, \u201cDelight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart,\u201d \u201cmeans that if you are delighting him Him, seeking after Him and honoring Him, His desires will more naturally become your desires.\u201d The book also references Matt. 6:33.\u2022 \u201cPrinciple 2: Financial Prosperity is Connected to Soul Prosperity.\u201d\u2022 The book says that Matt. 5:5 means, \u201cHe [God] wants us to be meek toward Him, not toward men.\u201d\u2022 The book says that Rom. 13:8, \u201cOwe no man but for your love,\u201d means, \u201cyou are never to owe money. If you want to buy something, but don\u2019t have the money for it, you don\u2019t buy it.\u201dPart I\u2019m unsure aboutThe \u201ceye of the needle\u201d referred to small doors in Jerusalem\u2019s gates that required a camel to crawl through on its knees. So, it wasn\u2019t impossible for a camel to go through, but it was difficult.Notes on Prosperity TheologyMy wife was reading Money Possessions and Eternity by Randy Alcorn at the same time I was reading this book, and she recommended it. I read the chapter on Prosperity Theology and made these notes:\u2022 If God wants all His people to be materially successful, why weren\u2019t Jesus, the disciples, Paul, and others?\u2022 In the New Testament, the Greek word \u201cploutos\u201d is used 11 times to refer to spiritual, not material, riches: Rom. 11:33, Eph. 1:18, Phil. 4:19, Col. 1:27.\u2022 God doesn\u2019t promise material success to His people. See Job 1:8, Job 42:7, Luke 16:19-31, Luke 6:20-25, 2 Tim. 3:12, 1 Pet. 5:9, John 15:18-20, Matt. 10:16-20, John 16:33, Luke 14:33, Phil. 3:7-8.Other verses to consider: Luke 12:15 and Matt. 6:19-21."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4091412-brian", "userReview": "Read in one sitting.

Characters are separated enough that there is no issues distinguishing between them, even with reading in short bursts.

It did not seem as forceful as others. Given that, plus some sound ideologies and I think this is a book I will revisit shortly. However, there was nothing profound about the principles.

Dave Ramsey loves this book, and I can see why. Short read, so it doesn't go very deep on the subjects of working in business, building wealth, giving, and more. There are good principles here, told in a short, somewhat entertaining fable.Get out of debt -- and stay out of debt forever. That principle alone would solve the financial problems of just about every struggling American. But most people don't want to be humble enough to submit to such a basic principle as that.Give 10% to the church. Would have liked to see him push for giving significantly above and beyond 10% throughout one's working years....rather than suggesting that generous giving is done in the form of end-of-life bequests.Other reviewers have noted the book espouses the Prosperity Gospel. That may be true. But, financial prosperity (or peace) does not necessarily equal great wealth. I work as a financial planner/advisor. We have a number of clients whom few would refer to as affluent: they have never earned more than $50,000 in their lives, yet they paid off debt, gave generously, and saved aggressively.

I read this book as background material for Financial Coach training. The book provides 12 principles for successful living with an accompanying story (an arc of a businessman's life in 15th Century Venice/Rome). A very quick read. The principles promote ideas of personal responsibility, financial prudence, and loving God. Nothing earthshattering or offensive. I suppose I find the separation of clergy and merchant class difficult. I also note that many people in this tale are fishermen, cooks, and servants. It seems to me the legend lacks a message for them. Or, perhaps I just don't accept the economic nostrum that people derive work and money from what the wealthy do. I believe that a robust economy depends on an interconnecting matrix of people performing services for each other (and not just for the tag ends of the wealthy). The principles are fine as far as they go, but one would do much better with Daniel Lapin's Thou Shall Prosper which has a much deeper examination of Biblical precepts and principles. Admittedly, that's a harder read."}, {"userName": "Jeremy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2474298-jeremy", "userReview": "\"The Legend of the Monk and the Merchant\u201d is a pilgrim tale. It\u2019s a tale designed for people who want to go places and make their life count. This tale centers around the journey of a grandfather (Antonio) and his grandson (Julio), with the life lessons that come about during this time. Antonio brought his grandson Julio to Rome to see the sites and to offer a good deal of wisdom. Through the recounting of Antonio\u2019s life, the reader is given a glimpse into sound financial principles. Given that it was endorsed by financial guru Dave Ramsey, the narrative centered on smart business techniques and wise advice on running from debt.There are many great stories in the Western canon of literature, and those stories that stick out in mind have a strong message underneath it all. Some pieces are more subtle than others, and as was mentioned above, this one was pretty blatantly open in its messaging. Terry Felber in the course of the story offered this advice throughout each stage of the tale:1 Work hard and God will prosper you2 Financial prosperity is connected to soul prosperity.3 A man must do whatever he can to provide for his family4 Trials develop your character, preparing you for increased blessings5 Take responsibility for problems that are the result of your own bad decisions. Don't displace the blame6 See challenges as stepping stones, not as obstacles.7 Be meek before God, but bold before men8 Live debt free and below your means9 Loaning money destroys relationships.10 Always keep to your budget.11 Set aside the first 10% to honor God12 Understand the power of partnership.As a seminary student, I noticed that some of the biblical passages were stretched to support these points. Among those, the author sets a dichotomy between kings and priests, and this serves a major function in the story. Felber stretches the text to mean something that is not there, in my humble opinion. Splitting the difference between vocational/sacred ministry (read: working at a church) and business/secular ministry (read: working outside of the church building) can be done for other biblical reasons, but taking a verse out of context to justify this position was a bit too much. The second point in this story is the most difficult one for me to fully endorse. This point gives too much credence to a \u201cname it and claim it\u201d theology of Joel Osteen. The other points, however, are very powerful if they become embedded into an individual\u2019s life.This book is ideal for those who might be more inclined towards business principles and leadership works. The fictional account is a nice story and the morals behind it are very helpful. If you like Dave Ramsey and his approach to finances, you\u2019ll love this book. If you want a book, however, to captivate you while lounging at the beach, I would recommend that you steer clear of this one. Felber\u2019s work will not be the most brilliant work of literature you have ever read; however, it will help cast the above principles in a narrative form. Would I recommend it? Not necessarily. I would recommend the above principles (with the exception of Number 2), but am rather cautious when it comes to the distinction between secular and sacred vocations expounded in the book.2 Stars out of 5Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze\u00ae.com  book review bloggers program.

The story is set in historic Italy, one of my favorite settings for a book. But the most important parts about this book are the timeless principles. The narration is a grandfather who has been a successful businessman reading through his journal to his grandson. The grandfather describes his meetings with his mentor every three years and the principles that his mentor taught him. He also covers the important events in his life that helped teach him those principles.This book covers everything from faith to finances to relationships. It describes how to handle money responsibly for God, using His principles. It guides readers on how to handle money with family. It points out that wealth is not a bad thing, and how it can be used for the good of God and others. The principles of hard work and dedication are all throughout this story.My only warning is that I believe Christians should study God's Word separately from the book. Some blanket principles are given for all based on a single verses without context (verses are referenced in the back of the book). Most, if not all, of the principles are very good to adopt and follow, but may not be perfect for all and I'm not certain that God meant for it to be exactly as the book states. For example, Principle Seven is \"Be meek before God, but bold before men.\" The author uses Matthew 5:5 \"the meek will inherit the Earth\" as his foundation that we should be meek before God, but gives no reference as to where God says we should always be bold before men. In studying God's word, even the same chapter in Matthew, one can read \"But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.\" (Matthew 5:39) That verse is not exactly telling people to be bold towards others. It is another example where God calls us to be meek. This principles is given as a business principle and I'm not saying that we should never be bold. But this is an example of one of the principles where I think readers need to understand the full context of the Bible when determining where God would prefer they be bold vs meek. I believe there may be a few other cases in the principles given in this book that I would recommend readers think for themselves about. Just don't take what this book says about the Gospel as the Gospel.Aside from warning others to make their own interpretations of God's Word based on their own studies and counsel from their Christian leaders, I believe this book provides many excellent principles and I would highly recommend it. The story is also an enjoyable one to follow."}, {"userName": "Virginia Garrett", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7919784-virginia-garrett", "userReview": "A number of years ago, I worked for a man who was rebuilding department in the company. He took sound business practices and worked to make the department better, run smoother and in all be a little more profitable. During my course of being in his employ, he had me read a book about business. The name of the book escapes me but it was written in story form to teach the reader about business. I stayed up that night reading all but the final few chapters; those were finished before work the next morning which started at 7am. I simply could not put the book down. I encountered another book just like that one. Only this one I do remember the name! It is, The Legend of the Monk and the Merchant and is authored by Terry Felber, with a forward by non other than Dave Ramsey himself. The book is set in the late 15th and early 16th centuries in Italy. It is a Grandfather telling his grandson the story of how he came to be a merchant and not a monk. Antonio, the grandfather, had lost his parents and nearly his life as a young child. He was rescued and taken in by a monk. He grew up in the church, learning about the Christian faith. When he was older, the monk sent him to live and work with a friend of his, Alessio. This was to determine if God was calling Antonio to the work of a monk or a merchant. He realized at the end of two months God was calling him to the world of business. He knew only what Alessio had taught him. They made arrangements to meet together on one specific night every three years. Each night they met, Alessio had a new business truth to share with Antonio based on what he was learning and experiencing. Through triumph and tragedy they met together for years. Now I am not going to share the principles with you; you'll have to get the book to find them for yourself. Terry Felber wove a wonderful story. The plot and characters were exceptional. The principles were outstanding. Scripture was woven throughout the story. There is an appendix full of the references to the passages used. The Legend of the Monk and the Merchant is a book about business but translates well into the business of living. All of the principles apply to daily life and not just the daily life of a merchant. The book releases on January 1, 2013 but you can pre-order it from amazon.com. And you might want to. I know if we all read it and applied the principles our new year and our world would change.
