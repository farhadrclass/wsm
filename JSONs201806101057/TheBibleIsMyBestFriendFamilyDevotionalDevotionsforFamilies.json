Each devotions starts out with a memory verse, followed by the one page devotion. Then there is a Let's Talk that gives families a chance to talk about how the devotion applies to their life. Followed by a Family Fun section with a craft that goes along with the topic, and a Weekly Challenge and a Check Point for the family to talk about things they can do to take action about the devotion. This is a neat devotional, it can be used for the entire family. I like that the devotions are so short because it give you the opportunity to use the devotions for a wide age span. You can easily add to what is written for each day if your children are older. The layout of the book is beautiful and the pages are full of color, the people and graphics are adorable and would be cute for any age. This is a very nice family devotional book. I encourage you to check out this Family Devotional by Shelia Walsh."}, {"userName": "Kyle Robertson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7354568-kyle-robertson", "userReview": "This is a great book to get children excited about learning key stories from the Bible. It is designed to make reading the Bible fun and engaging. The stories are tailored to spark and maintain a child's interest, but the stories remain biblically sound. Beautiful full-color illustrations compliment the stories, and I like the hidden objects feature that will further engage the young reader. This book contains 52 Bible stories that are designed to teach children the fundamental principles of Christianity. Each story concludes with a memory verse to help children remember the key points they've learned, along with a section for parents to reiterate key points. I highly recommend this book to all Christians, especially those with young children whose curious minds will soak up God's Word and carry it with them. I received this as a free ARC from B&H Publishing Group on NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Library_geek", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17573897-library-geek", "userReview": "As a child I loved books like Shelia Walsh's 'The Bible is my Best Friend', I had two that I cherished dearly and still own one of them. For this reason I was excited to preview this book via NetGalley.This book engages the young reader through hidden objects, memory verses and a parent connection section. One of the most important parts of children's books to me is the illustrations. As I am finding with Shelia's titles, colour is used well and usually makes a statement by being bright and cartoon like.. Each story in the book has a reference to the bible verses which I think is of great importance because the parent or the reader can check that the stories are true to God's word.Walsh further educates the reader by having a memory at the end of each chapter. This is a great way to encourage your child to commit God's word to memory. The book makes reading the bible for the young reader fun and less daunting. It is evident that the author has put a lot of constructive thought into creating this book and has covered both the Old and New Testament. I like the use of some creative titles to the chapters such as chapter two which is titled 'A Ssssssssneaky Mistake' and Chapter 30 'Here Comes Jesus!'. I will be recommending this read to my christian friends and my church as I feel that it is a valuable read not only in a library setting but within the church community."}, {"userName": "Emily Copeland", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38160015-emily-copeland", "userReview": "The Bible Is My Best Friend is a family devotional that I absolutely recommend to any parents looking to incorporate family devotions into their daily routines. I can\u2019t think of a better resource specifically for families to use together for devotional time! The weekly devotions help kids (and adults) apply scripture to their lives, while providing plenty of reinforcement using a variety of methods. This is a devotional I\u2019m thrilled to have found!

Fifty-two key scriptures form the basis for the devotions, which build on the verses, challenge the family to commit them to memory, and explore how each verse is part of God's wonderful message. \"Let's Talk\" questions urge the family to discuss what they've learned and offer challenges for different ages of\u00a0children as well as their parents.\u00a0 \u00a0 This unique family devotional touches both the mind and the heart. Minds will grow as the text builds on past weeks by reviewing memory work and themes. But most importantly, hearts will grow as families learn together to value the gifts found in the Bible and realize how God's\u00a0Word can be their greatest friend.", "title": "The Bible Is My Best Friend--Family Devotional: 52 Devotions for Families", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25102502-the-bible-is-my-best-friend--family-devotional", "average": 4.75, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1426580440l/25102502.jpg", "reviews": 4, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21763.Sheila_Walsh", "name": "Sheila Walsh"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25102502-the-bible-is-my-best-friend--family-devotional", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29227887-the-bible-is-my-best-friend-bible-storybook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8722171-angel-song", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10131696-the-shelter-of-god-s-promises", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7506581-beautiful-things-happen-when-a-woman-trusts-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126816-the-storm-inside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9740473-sweet-sanctuary"]}
