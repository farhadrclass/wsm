Imagine if Marc St. James from Ugly Betty gave his own backstory \u2013 and I think you will be able to picture Carlos perfectly! He was sassy, confident, and just a perfect blend of ambitious and niceness to make for a likeable main character.I am not a makeup fiend (\u2026well, maybe I dabble in eyeshadows like a regular Bob Ross), but the enthusiasm that exudes from Carlos as he lands a job at a Macy\u2019s cosmetics counter is all but infectious. I think anyone who has any retail experience can appreciate the challenge of handling a moody, self-centered boss and learning how to make ornery customers feel beautiful again.I did appreciate that Carlos came from a low-income family, and he struggled to help his family make ends meet. So many books seem to have characters who live charmed lives where they don\u2019t have to worry about food or meeting rent, and this story element brought more tension to Putting Makeup On The Fat Boy than what would have been if Carlos had been born to riches.As enjoyable as watching Carlos walk the path toward his dream career, there were a few bumps in the road that seemed a little too disconnected with the ultimate goal. Of course, no road traveled should be without detours and obstructions, but I did not think enough time had been spent on them \u2013 and these projects were left unfinished or else with an less-than-desirable ending. Perhaps I have read too many happy-ever-afters, but even the unhappy-ever-afters seemed not fully realized when I reached the end.Putting Makeup On The Fat Boy is a charming read, despite the title that sounds a bit rude, and Carlos embraces himself with as much joie de vivre as the cast of Ugly Betty does. A sequel would be very welcomed in my mind since there were a few loose ties that I thought still needed closure."}, {"userName": "Joanne Palin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22633739-joanne-palin", "userReview": "I enjoyed it.

When he hears about a chance to apply at Macy's to work at one of their make-up counters, he knows this is going to open the doors to his dreams of becoming a famous make-up artist. Carlos soon learns that this may prove to be more difficult than he had first though. Throw in problems with his sisters, a crush, and dealing with severe homophobia , and Carlos soon has more on his plate than he thought he'd have to deal with.Carlos is a fun person! He is so sure of himself, and you can't help but feel positive while reading about him. I have no doubt that he would be everything he wants to be in life. He had a lot of things to deal with in this book, and he did it all with a fabulous sense of grace. I had two small complaints. One was that Carlos could seem a little bit too much like a stereotype. It just seemed to pull me out of the story and didn't really fit who I felt Carlos was. The other has to do with the homophobia directed at him. He just seemed a little too passive about it for me. I really didn't feel a reaction about it one way or the other from him. I just wanted a little more there.Those issues aside, I thought this was a fun book. I think it's great to have a book like this with an out and proud teen. While coming of age type coming out stories have their place, it's awesome to just have a fluffy book. While some serious issues are dealt with, over all this book is just plain fun. It helps to emphasize the \"normal-ness\" of Carlos.

He was obsessed with how people looked and while he was horrified by anyone daring to judge him, he judged everyone else constantly. Even his friends, like Angie who apparently ate a lot when she was stressed. He was constantly mentioning how gross it was, but he describes himself as \"big\" as well, so this seemed really hypocritical. Anyone whose fashion sense and makeup style didn't match his own was viewed as ridiculous. I actually snorted out loud when he got a black eye and mentioned that he didn't usually consider himself vain. Hopefully it was meant to be ironic. He also took stupid risks and was completely willing to put his friend at risk of losing her job just so he could wear some expensive shoes to an interview. The writing style is exceptionally well-developed and conversational. Even though I didn't like Carlos and would never want to meet him in real-life, I definitely felt like he was real and I was in his head. There were a few places where he was sympathetic and showed more dimensions, like his pain at not knowing how to be \"the man\" of the family and protect his sister, or having a crush on someone who could never like him back. Maybe if at the end of the novel I'd felt like he'd learned more, I would have liked this better."}, {"userName": "Freshmengal72", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33761947-freshmengal72", "userReview": "The book was interesting enough for me to finish it but it wasn't an enjoyable read. The main character, Carlos, is a boy who does makeup and as a reader, one would expect the typical backlash and want to know how he's going to combat that. The book didn't really have any serious conflict though. Sure, Carlos was met with questioning looks from people who weren't accustomed to seeing what could be summed up as \"a pretty boy\" and when he was younger his mom wasn't sure if this would emasculate him, but him being a boy who does makeup doesn't have a very upfront conflict. There's nothing for Carlos to lose a boy who likes makeup, one would think he'd fear being less masculine but this isn't on his list of priorities and is left unconfrontational which left me wanting an escalation of some type in the story.  The title also mentions his weight, and from what I gather he isn't a fat boy currently in the story, but was a little chubby as a kid. As someone who was and still is plus size I thought this may affect his self-esteem, maybe he feels like there's no point in working in beauty when the beauty industry doesn't always favor plus size people, or maybe he's met with barriers for being someone who works in beauty because people feel like someone \"like him\" couldn't be a beauty expert. Instead, the book mentions him liking fatty foods about twice, one being an offhanded \"pun\" (if you can call it that) in the beginning and the other being about how he stopped eating fried food to avoid pimply skin. Carlos also references calling himself a fat boy when he was younger and how he felt pretty in makeup despite being chubby, but once again it's in a short sentence that holds no weight to the story. Carlos being chubby or having been chubby has no effect on the story whatsoever even though it's in the title. If he had been thin as a child he could have still talked about cutting back on skin-ruining foods and there'd simply be a few jokes missing in the book. When I saw there aren't any major conflicts in the story, there are conflicts but they don't get the story going anywhere, they're simply there. Carlos' sister, Rosalita has an abusive (ex)boyfriend who Carlos stands up to in the end, but Carlos winds up getting basically nothing out of it except the satisfaction of standing up for his sister. and maybe decreasing the chances she'll ever be a victim again. It's nice that he did that, but what was the point of this storyline? Rosalita's abuse never had an impact on Carlos. It brought a little fight, her ex, Danny, called Carlos out for being gay once and would laugh at him behind his back, but the main story wouldn't change if Danny wasn't included.  Then there's Carlos' friend Soraya. He borrows boots from her, this connects back to the Danny story because he promises he'll return them unblemished and only wear them for a job interview, Danny attacks Carlos while he's wearing the boots when he shouldn't be, Carlos and Soraya's friendship is ruined. Carlos got to wear cute boots to an interview and in the process ruined his relationship with a close friend. He feels bad about it but it doesn't hold a significant impact on Carlos' life. I suppose he's supposed to have learned responsibility from this but not really because later he \"steals\" makeup from the company he works at to help a somewhat reliable celebrity. Only then does he realize the consequences of his actions and that's only because he's afraid of going to jail. The biggest conflict Carlos' faces are his single mother being laid off her job and Carlos needing to step up as \"the man\" of the house and help financially (on his own accord, however, so, point for him.) Carlos needs the makeup job at the mall and has to work a second job. OK, that must be a struggle for a high schooler. Not really. He works his job like usual, and gets the job pretty easily and manages to quickly get a job working for a celebrity. The money issues aren't brought up again after his mom get's laid off and is offered a job later (though this isn't cleared up either, she's offered a job from the brother of her original employer, and she says she's going to see if it pays as much as her last job before taking it but the story leaves it at that.) After the fact that there is a lack of substantial conflict that leaves the reader rooting for Carlos, there's the romance issue. Carlos has a crush on a boy, boy is straight and puts up a cool guy front in front of his peers, Carlos has hopes to love boy, says a little line about marriage equality, then realizes boy is waste of his time, and boy's girlfriend realizes Carlos may be after her man so makes boy kindly tell Carlos he sees them as friends. The story tries to pull the reader along as if the romance is a big deal, but honestly it's a surface-deep love, infatuation even. Carlos seems to like the other boy, Gleason, mostly for his looks. Gleason's artistic too, so they do have something in common, but not really. If Gleason was unattractive, I doubt Carlos would have been as interested as he was. They spoke a little, Gleason helped photograph some of Carlos' makeup looks, but they didn't form any in-depth relationship, they didn't share hopes, dreams, talk about family life or any of that. It was a surface level friendship laced with one-sided infatuation. The only reason I kept reading was that I wanted to see Carlos bump into a wall, fall into complete despair, be left broken and forced to build himself up. Instead, he achieved his dreams in a surprisingly short amount of time for an inexperienced young artist with the expected resistance from his poorly guided decisions and the doubt people had about a young boy who could do makeup."}, {"userName": "Tess Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34171358-tess-anderson", "userReview": "Putting Makeup on the Fat Boy by Bil Wright is one of the Best intriguing books I've read this year.

Carlos Duarte is a high school student who lives with his single mom, victim of domestic violence, and his sister. Carlos is the quintessential gay man, complete with the desire to become a professional make-up artist and a love for high-heeled boots. Putting Makeup on the Fat Boy addresses several important issues that young adult readers may be facing such as domestic violence, bullying, homophobia, gender roles, interpersonal relationships and trouble at home. \tWhile this novel covers extremely important themes that are not frequently dealt with in young adult literature, there are a few flaws that I could not overlook. I enjoyed the plotline and the idea of the book, as I have a nephew who is very similar to Carlos. However, Carlos is written as a stereotypical gay teen. He is flamboyant, effeminate, and uses terms like \u201chon\u201d and \u201cdarling\u201d. I think that this is a common misconception that is very damaging to homosexual teens who do not behave in the way that is expected of them. I feel that the character of Carlos could have been more meaningful had the author created more depth outside of the typical gay man. A few of the other characters were also the victim of stereotypes, such as Ro and Danny. Perhaps there are young adult readers who feel connections to these types of characters, but I personally felt that they were flat. \tAnother issue I had with Putting Makeup on the Fat Boy was the voice in which it was written. The style of writing the author employed to give a teen voice to Carlos\u2019s narration seemed juvenile and inappropriate. I would have preferred grammatically correct English over writing about how Carlos was \u201csooooooooooooo excited!!!!!!\u201d One thing that I did appreciate was that the author did not translate or provide translations for the insults that Danny and the other workers used. As I know Spanish, when I read the word maric\u00f3n I felt my heart sink because I knew exactly what that meant and the weight that word caries in Hispanic culture. Translating that word would have detracted from its effect, and the reader can guess what it means in context or do the research on his or her own time. \tAll that being said, Putting Makeup on the Fat Boy is a good book with a solid plotline. If the aforementioned flaws did not exist, or my taste in writing were slightly different, I would definitely reread this book. I did not put this novel down until after I had completed it and felt emotional attachment to Carlos as a character. Putting Makeup on the Fat Boy made me feel, which is what I consider to be the characteristic of a good story."}, {"userName": "Malvika Puranik", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4590690-malvika-puranik", "userReview": "very interesting , kept me hooked till the end"}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1274105-mark", "userReview": "\"When I was twelve, I convinced my mother to let me do her makeup for Parents' Night.

But I don't think I should be encouraging something like this. I'm not gonna go to your school and tell your teacher, 'See my face! Isn't it pretty? My son did my makeup.

When Carlos learns of a part-time job opportunity at the makeup counter in Macy's, he jumps at the chance, and Carlos never does anything half way. He lands the job, and quickly becomes one of the most requested makeup artists in the store, drawing the ire of his jealous boss. On the home front, Carlos must also deal with his mother being laid off, his sister's abusive relationship with Danny, and whether or not the cute boy at school would ever be interested in him. As Carlos moves up the ladder in his professional career, he must also learn what it means to stand up for those he cares about the most. I *really* wanted to like this one, or at least understand how it won the Stonewall Award for this year, but . . . I couldn't. Especially not after having just read Chris Beam's excellent _I Am J_. Carlos showed so little growth as a character; I didn't need/want him to hit rock bottom and make it back up, but at the same time, I wanted him to show some development. I appreciated that he was proud and secure in himself, but he didn't really go anywhere from there. There were also a lot of plot points that didn't get resolved - Soraya, one of Carlos's best friends, supposedly - gets a small storyline, and then promptly forgotten, and his mother's unemployment is dropped as well. I also found myself way too distracted by all the product placement/fashion labeling in the book - I get that Carlos is up on all of these trends, but it was just too much. Obviously the book found an audience, or the Stonewall committee wouldn't have given it the top honor; it just didn't work at all for me."}, {"userName": "Holly Lewis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16212033-holly-lewis", "userReview": "Putting Makeup on the Fatboy by Bill Wright is about Carlos, a flamboyantly gay young adult pursuing a career in the make-up industry. Having just secured a job at a make-up counter at Macy's, he's trying to learn to juggle school, friends, home life ( with his emotional mother who lost her job and his older sister who can't find a decent job or a boyfriend who isn't a deadbeat), and work. Most of the story focuses on his job at Macy's and how he learns the ins and outs of competitive business; fed up with living under his boss's shadow and earning no credit for the sales he does, he tries to make it to the top by befriending a young actress he meets at the counter. Carlos tries to sell her new products in hopes he hits it big with her and gets offered to be her make-up artist. Carlos soon learns that there are always risks in life, as his decisions begin to put his family relationships and his friendships in jeopardy. He also learns that in some jobs, you have to work from the ground up, and your superiors can walk all over you. Carlos has to learn about how to balance all the aspects of his life and still make strides in his cut-throat job. And as if that's not enough, a gorgeous boy named Gleason has captured what little attention Carlos has left. I thoroughly enjoyed this book; I used it as my LGTBQ novel for the class, and I'm very glad that I did, because it's very innovative in that the main character's struggle isn't about coming out. I appreciate that Carlos is already out to the world and proud of who he is; the story doesn't focus on his sexuality, so much as it focused on the storyline of a budding make-up artist who just happens to also be gay. Carlos was a quirky, fun character, so the story was very easy to get into, and he kept my attention throughout the novel, even when the discussion about make-up got a bit dull. It's not a book I'd probably have picked up on my own, but i'm glad that I read it. I don't know many books like it.  Purely on reading level, I think I'd probably recommend this book to kids13 and older. There wasn't anything questionable about the material in the book that affects how I'd grade it. I'm not entirely sure where to place this book on the basis of who might like it; I liked it, and maybe people who enjoy LGTBQ novels or drama novels might like it, but it's a typical on both accounts (for the genres), so perhaps not.

So he did and he met this guy named Valentino and he was watching him do Carlos make up to her model Rosalia who is her sister. He got the job and started to work there, then all of this problems came to him he had some trouble with his sister that she was lying to them and she wouldn't tell what was happening to her. Then all of this problems came to, but he was more scare of what was happening to her sister because she came to Carlos job and told him to put some make up on her face to cover this mark that she had because her boyfriend punched her in the face, then Carlos was having a success working in Macy's people wanted to Carlos to do their make up. Carlos o most got kicked out of his job because he robed the store to put make up to her friend that he thought she was going to buy it but she didn't buy it that moment but she bought a lot of their make up and Carlos was saved. Then Carlos was in the park whit his friend and he got jumped by her sisters boyfriend and his friend were whit him to and both of them were hurt, then later on her sister boyfriend was in jail of hitting Rosaly, and Carlos was getting more famous with his make up.Some Main Characters:- Carlos-Rosalia -Angie-Valentino-Lissette I think that this book is good i could recommend to read it but i wouldn't recommend that its a really great book to read but you can read it if you don't know what book you want to read."}, {"userName": "Lacey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7593165-lacey", "userReview": "Putting Makeup on a Fat Boy follows Carlos Duarte's path to becoming a makeup artist, a virtual life long dream of his. Along this journey, however, Carlos encounters various personal struggles including bullying and homophobia, as well as his sister's struggle with an abusive relationship. I believe this book strikes a great balance between light-hearted humor and tough, realistic issues. While almost all of the characters, especially Carlos, fit many character stereotypes a little too well, I believe that doesn't deter from the realness of the characters, or the emotional connection the readers makes with them. For young adolescents, the main audience of this novel, I believe the strong, absolute characteristics of the book's characters provide something for young readers to relate with and connect to as they are forming their own unique identity. I throughly enjoyed how confident Carlos was with himself - so many stories feature gay or lesbian teenagers struggling with their identity, and I felt Carlos' self-confidence was inspiring. Lastly, I liked that the book dealt with the issues of homophobia, bullying, and domestic violence without being extremely graphic. Many others who have read books dealing with these issues felt like their books were extremely graphic and uncomfortable to read. While stepping out of your comfort zone is of course a positive thing, I liked that this book dealt with these serious topics in a way that wasn't inappropriate. While the book wasn't written with the most serious tone, I still felt like it was impactful while remaining enjoyable.

I found her a bit naive, but she didn\u2019t come up that often, so it didn\u2019t bother me too much. And anyways, it showed how reality can look like. Besides I liked seeing how working at a makeup counter is. I already knew there was a lot of rivalry and his boss just couldn\u2019t get over the fact that young Carlos was really good and really talented so he treated him badly. I think that shows how reality is perfectly as well. His family was like many other hispanic families living on a low income, but that didn\u2019t stop Carlos from dreaming about expensive designer clothing. Although I knew there had be some ups and downs, I didn\u2019t really understand why Carlos actually did some things he did, although he knew it would be difficult. Maybe some type of growing up, I don\u2019t know. He did some wrong things, which actually made me like him better, because he seemed more human this way. Anyways, I liked how Carlos was falling in love and getting his dream job. And I also liked that he wasn\u2019t an upper class child, but a lower class child who had to work for his success. It was a nice quick read with a cute storyline."}, {"userName": "Camden Bailey", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42447135-camden-bailey", "userReview": "OK, so I picked this book up because as an avid member of the LGBT community, I wanted to read more fiction that focused on gender nonconformity. So, Carlos is the son of a single Hispanic mother and a high schooler that loves doing makeup and is good at it. With the suggestion of his friend Angela, who works at Macy's, he applies and gets a job at the makeup counter at Macy's. After he begins his path to be a big shot makeup artist, his mother loses her job and his sister begins to have problems with her boyfriend. I had a lot of problems with this book. For starters, Carlos is a brat. I couldn't like him. Luckily, the chapters are short and I could only read a chapter or two before having to take a break. Carlos is so stereotypical and cliched for a YA gay main character. He likes stereotypical feminine things and is obsessed with fashion. Honestly, the amount of gay male cliches that the author put into Carlos' character made him unbearable. Another cliche is that Carlos' mother is a single mother working at a dry cleaners. His sister is in an abusive relationship. There's so many cliches that it makes the story unlikable and forgetable. (Spoilers ahead) Even Carlos meeting a famous actress in Macy's and becoming her makeup artist is really cliche. You can see it from a mile away. This book had potential. Having a non-white main character who isn't conventionally beautiful as the main character of a YA novel and making them gay were the only groundbreaking things in this novel and that is why I kept reading. The rest was so cliched. If you like cliches, this is for you. If not, don't even look at this novel."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3059012-leslie", "userReview": "Carrrlos! Count me amongst the fans of this fierce, fabulous high school student. He's the antithesis of practically everything I was back in school. He's a Latino son of a single mother, living in the inner city of New York. He's gay, wears make-up, is incredibly ambitious when it comes to achieving his dreams... all around awesome! I wish I'd had the kind of terrific self-confidence this character exemplifies when I was that age. Yes, Bil Wright simply nailed the voice of his protagonist in this novel, and it's easy to understand why it received a Stonewall Award. This first person narrative just exuded personality, which was a really pleasant change of pace from the much more typical (A.K.A. boring) voice of so many female leads these days. I particularly admired Wright's ability to dance of the edge of being over-the-top outrageous with the plot. More than once, often in fact, I found myself thinking... \"Okay, this story is about to jump the shark, we've about to move totally out of the world of contemporary fiction and into fantasy\". And then, Wright somehow managed to pull back from the brink. Carlos's world is full of obstacles, real ones, bullies, family issues, money troubles, relationship woes. Just as his glittery goals seem within his grasp, something gets in his way and makes him work that much harder - makes his resolve that much stronger. I say bravo to Wright's skillful balancing act; it really worked for me. He's created a story I won't soon forget and a character I would love to have known in real life."}, {"userName": "Gaby", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57215551-gaby", "userReview": "Putting Makeup on the Fat Boy by Bill Wright is a great novel about a boy who knows who he and what he wants out of life\u2026he\u2019s just not entirely sure how to go about achieving his goal. Carlos has always been good applying at makeup, since he was a little boy. He never thought it was an odd thing for a boy to do. His dream is to work for Hollywood and become a celebrity makeup artist the only thing is, he\u2019s not quite sure how to do that. When his best friend suggests trying to get a job at the prestigious FeatureFace makeup counter at Macy\u2019s Carlos knows exactly what he needs to nail the job\u2026a pair of high heel Stella McCartney boots. Along the way, Carlos will learn about friendship and the consequences our actions can have on even the most solid of relationships, family and what we are willing to do for them and love both imaginary and real. Most of all, Carlos learns about himself and that he can still be a man even if he wears a little concealer and lip gloss.This book is funny, heartfelt and inspiring without being preachy and anyone can see Carlos is a star in the making! I would recommend this book to anyone who\u2019s ever considered working as a makeup artist so that they can get a behind the scenes look at the steeliness needed to make it in a cutthroat industry. I would also recommend it to anyone who knows what their sexual identity is but is still unsure how to reconcile that with how others think our genders should behave.

And I also like it when the voice of a character is so strong that I don't read the story in a truncated version of my own voice like I usually do.This book had all that going for it.Despite confusion about the difference between 'Carlos' and 'Carrlos' (seriously, did I miss an explanation? I admit I can be a pretty dull reader), the story started out strong. I admit there were many times I thought Carlos would make a huge mistake and suffer a humiliating failure, and I'm glad things didn't go that way because I kind of hate it when that happens. Instead, I was pleased to read about how Carlos dripped with confidence dispite his nay-saying friends and family.The book reminded me a bit of FREAK SHOW, but not quite as humorous. (But FREAK SHOW was really funny, so that's still a compliment!)I was also surprised that Carlo's weight didn't play more of a role in the story, considering the title. But then I ask myself, Did it need to? And it didn't.Overall, a funny, light-hearted novel (though it deals a bit with domestic violence as well). If a sequel ever came out (since some things were left nice and open at the end), I'd love to read it."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49825354-alex", "userReview": "This book is a quality piece of queer YA! It follows the story of 16 year old aspiring make-up artist, Carlos. Refreshingly, this is not a coming of age story in the sense that it is about him realising his sexuality: in fact, how Carlos knew he was gay is never discussed (which I appreciate! Coming out stories are fascinating but they very much dominate the field of queer writing...). The story is instead about him following his career ambitions. This having been said, Carlos is very camp and his being gay is definitely a prevalent part of the story.As someone who looks very androgynous and is often misgendered myself, I really appreciated the way it wrote about Carlos, who one gathers looks very androgynous from other people's reactions to him, eg. a bus driver calling him \"miss\": I found this very subtle and artful writing. Likewise, it never explicitly states Carlos is gay, it just becomes apparent throughout the story.Also, without giving away spoilers, I appreciated that the story ended on an uplifting note without everything magically and perfectly falling into place.A good easy read (only took me a couple of days, but I am 24 so probably older than the target readership) and a refreshing change-up on a lot of tropes which normally fill both queer YA and queer writing in general."}], "description": "Carlos Duarte knows that he's fabulous.
