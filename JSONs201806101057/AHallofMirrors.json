I have to say that I was completely disappointed and underwhelmed. I'm not even sure about the three stars, but I'll leave it that way for now. There are three main characters, an alcoholic disc-jockey, a girl who's face was slashed with an oyster pick (I didn't know there was such a thing), and a guy who completes surveys with welfare recipients. All three of these people end up in New Orleans and they variously become entangled with a nefarious character who has it in for African Americans (in the book the N word is used repeatedly instead). Then basically at the end of the book all hell breaks loose, to what purpose I'm not really sure. I have Dog Soldiers, which is supposed to be his best book, so I'll probably give that a try at some point, but I'm in no great hurry to do so."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/214053-adam", "userReview": "Stone\u2019s first novel is harrowing portrait of America on the utter edge of despair and destruction. This is surreal American poetry of unease; which has been compared to Lowry (the chemical addled rants and prophetic visions), Conrad (the \u201cHollow Men\u201d Reinhardt and Sailor Farley), Nathaniel West (the deranged riot echoes the ending of Day of the Locust), and Chandler. Set in a Jim Crow era New Orleans (recast as a hell out of Bosch or Dante), but its unholy vision of conservative talk radio, false prophets of the Christian right, and the willingness to provoke violence to sway public opinion; has not dated at all."}, {"userName": "Eli Bishop", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/278873-eli-bishop", "userReview": "It's just ridiculous for a first novel to be this good. Yes, it sometimes wanders off into purple Beatness (which was one of the things I loved when I first read it way back when, and less so now) but it's still so rich and earthy and funny, and even when the humor is mean, there's a compassion to it that Stone didn't always bring to his later books. Rheinhardt is the kind of smart bitter wastrel that Stone has written about a lot and he's very good at writing that kind of dialogue (I still crack up every time I read the \"seven years in Fernando Poo\" scene), but if the book had all been about him, as it starts out seeming to be, it would've been empty. Geraldine and Rainey, the awkward characters with hearts, are what really ground the book and make Rheinhardt's choices feel so terrible.Also, as well as being an often bizarre stream-of-consciousness satire and a tragic love story, it manages to be politically acute in a way that feels depressingly up to date. Stone makes it very clear where he stands, his right-wing radicals are definitely villains, but they're real people too (with the possible exception of one guy who may be the devil) and what they're doing makes as much sense as it ever did."}, {"userName": "Jeff Jackson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/811567-jeff-jackson", "userReview": "3.5 stars. Compelling for its insightful portrait of extreme right-wing politics, showing the complex and sophisticated ways businessmen harness issues of welfare, race, patriotism, and religion to dupe an under-educated populace and magnify their hateful messages using talk radio. Written in 1964, this must have seemed brazenly cynical and paranoid at the time, but now it reads like a practical playbook for how things are done. There are brilliant set pieces full of dark comedy and the surreal New Orleans atmosphere is effective, but the story and prose are also clunky in places.

Highly recommended for all Stone fans or anyone who enjoys that nebulous sub genre called \"literary thriller.\" The surprising thing about it is its year of publication, 1968. It's about a right wing, racist uprising in New Orleans, and damned if the dialog and various speeches don't seem to come straight out of yesterday's report from Fox News. Nothing has changed in this country, concerning race, for the last fifty years.

It can definitely go on for a while, but there are enough little gems scattered throughout the book to make it a worthwhile read.The writing is definitely the best part of the book. Pretty much all of my favorite parts were conversations that sort of throw the many political and social viewpoints in the book against one another. Rainey and the bartender talking about the Big Store, Rheinhardt and Rainey's philosophical discussion near the middle, and the Rheinhardt, Bingamon, Jack Noonan all stand out as the best the book has to offer.The story got me interested initially, but it takes a while to get into it and you never really learn much about the political stuff until the end. A lot of the book consists of characters talking, drinking, and speculating about themselves and the world at large. Not always bad, but it can get a little heavy handed and repetitive.The characters range from relatively complex and interesting to one dimensional. Rheinhardt is probably the most developed, but that's not saying much. He's detached so unsurprisingly things go wrong for him, which he essentially takes as justification for his cynicism and detachment. At various times he realizes that he's really largely responsible for all the pain he's caused himself and others, but just collapses in on himself rather than make any meaningful changes.Rainey started out as an interesting character, but sort of gets lost in the shuffle. He's constantly looking for meaning in his life but can't seem to get past this middle-of-the-road, half-measure existence. He pretty much lets the perfect be the enemy of the good through the whole book, and when he can't bring himself to manifest his ideals as actions, he finds someone who can do so, and attempts to pretty much \"tag along.\" Unsurprisingly, he gets cold feet and screws things up for both of them, and somehow this is the decision he feels finally lets him off the hook. Yeah, Rainey kind of sucks.Geraldine was by far the most disappointing - her story started off really well and was interesting (her scenes when she first arrives in New Orleans are great social commentary), but as soon as she becomes Rheinhardt's love interest we see less of less of her, and those scenes pretty much boil down to, \"Why doesn't Rheinhardt love me back?\" Not surprising that a dude from the '60s can't write great female characters, but the strong start made the fall that much harder.So looking at all this it would appear that I didn't like the book, but I still keep thinking about it so there must be something there. While the characters are generally unlikeable, they're pretty well developed and the internal monologues and discourses are really well written and compelling. The book definitely made me feel something, it just wasn't anything good.All in all, it's definitely a good book, but perhaps not a very enjoyable one."}, {"userName": "Paul Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37672894-paul-thomas", "userReview": "I'm glad I didn't read this one first. While Dog Soldiers and A Flag for Sunrise are two of my favorite books, Robert Stone's first novel shows how hard it is to write like Robert Stone. Very sloppy, very long and highly undeveloped, this treatise on activism in the 60's (or is it a limp satire on southern culture) was illegible at times. He tried so hard to make his main characters hippies and scammers and racists that pages would go by and the reader would have no idea what Stone was talking about. A lot of stoned, wondering diatribes of social commentary. And the same with the anti southern culture part. Paragraph upon paragraph of trite stereotype.

It's the 60's and you know it, but it's got the same New Orleans scene. This time there are some extra anti-heroes. Maybe this one goes next to UNDER THE VOLCANO by Lowry, too. It goes between those two for me, though there are probably big gaps and wrong connections, but I don't know, I'm still thinking about it.
