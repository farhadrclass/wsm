It read like a middle schooler wrote it (and if that's the case I'm so sorry I didn't love it but keep writing yay). I thought I could handle the super cheesy plot full of shallow, cliche characters (the MC and her best friend were the \"leaders of the most popular group of girls in the senior class, and thus the entirety of North Valley High\"), but the poor quality of writing made it impossible to endure. I really don't have words for how annoying everything was and definitely would recommend avoiding this.

And of course I am a girl, so how could I not love a guy as nice as Beau and his sweet&silly song about allergies :)) LOL Ok, ok, ... yeah, I also have a thing for the guys that know how to play guitar - dark hair, blue eyes and playing guitar - you do the math, back in high school it would have been the perfect boyfriend :p Not sure if a full 4 stars, but a sweet, funny and a great (late) Christmas read :)PS: One day a year I do believe in Santa Clause, because I want to :D\nThis review can be found at ReadingAfterMidnight.com____________________________________________Blog (EN) | Facebook | Twitter | Tumblr | Bloglovin' | Blog (RO)____________________________________________"}, {"userName": "Gabrielle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14161910-gabrielle", "userReview": "The plot's idea was very original and it was very cute. It was light, cute, and fluffy just what i needed. At first i did not like Beau because i thought he was too cold and dry with Lila but by the end he grew on me. He helped Lila see where she was wrong in the decisions she made and he helped her find herself again. Lila's superficiality annoyed me in the beginning a bit but her character grew and changed as the story went along. The adventure, road-trip aspect was executed well and i enjoyed that element of the story. It was a very fun aspect of the story. I also liked the singing and guitar playing parts of the story especially toward the end they were so cute and sweet. I thought it was adorable how they had their own song. The writing style hooked me in right away, the story was very entertaining and interesting. I was excited to see what would happen between Beau and Lila. Although it was pretty predictable around the middle i still enjoyed the overall story. The whole family togetherness element of the book was very heart warming and cute i liked that little touch. Overall, this was a cute,fun read nothing wow, amazing but I'm still glad i read it. I would definitely recommend it if your in the mood for a light read or as a break from dystopian or heavy books."}, {"userName": "Stuti (Turmeric isn't your friend.

Another of my complaints is that the other kids shouldn't have been shown as so completely shallow-like Beau was right all along. What crap.

I don't like bubblegum pop either but seriously dude? where do you get off making fun of people for their choices in music, clothes or makeup?But I did like the whole adventure angle.I didn't like the little kid getting off easily for tattling angle. Kids, especially by the year they're eight, should already learn that it's NOT okay to tattle. This is why kids are so dangerous. They make you want to punch them but soon as the thought crosses your mind, you want to rip up yourself, undo your entire existence, wipe the very last traces of noise you unleashed into the universe from aforementioned because thinking about punching kids is not done. It's a fundamental concept. But kids tattling is NOT humane. But then I guess those punks aren't actually humans yet, you know?BUT JEEZ, my brother learned not to tattle before he was six. Or something. My sister and I made sure of that, and we didn't even have that much of anything to hide at that point.

I loved the idea of a little boy going to the North Pole to save Santa from global warming and how cheesy the book really is. I only had one problem with this book (the main character\u2019s snobbiness), but still enjoyed the book.Ex-mas has such an adorable concept that really made me smile. After Lila shows her little brother an article from her science class, he goes on a mission to the North Pole to save Santa from global warming with his best friend, who just happens to be the brother of Lila\u2019s ex. Lila then sets out with her ex to go find her brother before her parents come home from their own trip. I loved reading about the journey from Southern California to Seattle and all the drama along the way. If you enjoyed books like Amy and Roger\u2019s Epic Detour, you will love Ex-mas.This is the kind of Christmas book that is perfectly cheesy and unrealistic. I mean, who lets two eight-year-olds take public transport across the country unsupervised? However, in this kind of book, the whole thing is clich\u00e9, so you don\u2019t bother questioning it. I love to read these short and cute books around Christmastime, so I don\u2019t mind the predictability at all.At the beginning of the book, I didn\u2019t really like Lila\u2019s character. She is such a snob and is so rude to her brother. She also doesn\u2019t see what\u2019s right in front of her and how much she\u2019s changed for the worse. Lila\u2019s personality bothered me so much at times that I almost wanted to put the book down. While a trip with someone from her past was able to knock some sense into her, I still had trouble connecting with her character.Ex-mas is a sweet holiday road trip book that is perfectly clich\u00e9. I loved everything about this book except for the rude main character.

I've never even read any of Kieran's books! For those of you who don't know, Kate Brian is a pen name/pseudonym that author Kieran Scott writes under. (Which is a lot more common than you would think!) Anyway, I've really been looking forward to reading a Kate Brian novel and then when I saw the synopsis for Ex-mas, I knew this was my chance!This was one of the cutest feel good books I've read in such a long time. And it was just what I was looking for. I've been in this serious-tone-book-mode and I needed something light. Now ordinarily I'd call something like this light and fluffy, but while the overall tone of the story is light, there is some deep elements to the novel too.Writing was fantastic and simplistic, plot flowed nicely, and characterization was great. It's a little bit on the predictable side, actually it's not a little predictable, it's predictable... period. But it's still really fun to read and watch these two characters. I'm getting those feel good vibes just writing this review and thinking about it!Definitely recommend this for something cute, fast and fun!

Lila Beckwith can't wait for her parents to go on a vacation because she's planned the school's biggest party of the year, in the hopes that she will become someone memorable when she graduates. But when Lila's little brother Cooper discovers her plans and tells their parents, the party is off and Lila's hopes of getting a car before she starts college hangs in the balance. Things however go from bad to worse when Cooper discovers that global warming is melting the North Pole and now, he and his best friend have run away to try and save Santa.

Can Lila and Beau put aside their differences and reach their brothers before their parents find out and before their old feelings resurface?Ex-Mas is a fun packed read. It's cute and has some funny moments and it offers everything you want in a short read, but the down side, it's just that, a quick read that's not very memorable despite how enjoyable it is. It's full of adventure though - even though a little unrealistic - but still, enjoyable. Beau had to be my favourite character. At times I wasn't too sure in what he saw in Lila because while Beau is a down to earth character, I found Lila a little shallow. She's always quick to judge people and she judges Beau the most. I didn't like that about Lila. But as the story progresses, she stopped doing it so much, stopped caring what other people thought about her and became a much more likable person. But Beau, he was awesome from the start and with a name like that - how could he not be awesome? In all, Ex-Mas is a cute and quick holiday story but don't go into it with too many expectations, otherwise you may be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Sarah Louise", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31221125-sarah-louise", "userReview": "If you can ignore the fact of how unrealistically this story unfolds, it was absolutely adorable. There's something about the theme of Christmas that makes unrealistic stories charming, am I right? Hate-to-love romances are my guilty pleasure, and this one was no exception with two exes forced to flee on a road-trip, chasing two little boys on their own mission to save Santa. Am I really supposed to believe that two eight-year-old boys are able to move across states and potentially cross the border into Canada? No. Like I said, you have to put away your judgement before going into this one, and once you do, there's definitely a fun story underneath.What dampened Ex-mas for me was our main character, Lila. She's your typical snobby, thinks she better than everyone else, senior, and with such a large portion of this short book featuring her rotten attitude, it was hard to like her. Overall, this one was mostly a winner, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a holiday read."}, {"userName": "phoebe carrazco", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33247887-phoebe-carrazco", "userReview": "[I didn't really like Lila at first but she got better as the story went on.

The characters are just wonderful, and I especially love the little brothers who decide to take a joy-ride to save their beloved Santa, how awesome is that? I wish I had a chance to go in such a trip. Definitely adding to list-of-things-to-do. I've never tried Kate Brian books before, but the shiny cover and the promise of a love/hate story was too good to resist, and I sure am glad I decided to give this novel a go. A Christmas love story of the century y'all.My Summary: Lila Beckwith was once a down-to-earth girl who was nothing like the snob she is now. Ever since she took that step towards comforting the school's golden girl, and got invited to her birthday party, she's never been the same again. Now Lila has everything. The most popular girl in the school is her best friend, her best friends hot brother, who's in college, is now her boyfriend, and she hangs around with the A-listers in her school, what more could a girl ask for right? But her real troubles are at home, where she has to deal with her younger brother's immature antics every day of her life. But when her little brother takes things a little too far by crashing her one chance at becoming the talk of the year, she's ready for a little pay-back, and the best way to start? By crushing her brother's over-blown and childish belief of Santa Claus. But things take a turn for the unexpected, when Lila somehow ends up on a crazy journey with her ex to track down both their brothers before her parents come home for the holiday. That is, if these two love-birds can put aside their heated banter for one single moment in hopes of finding their brothers. One thing's for sure, this trip's bound to bring back their chemistry, and just in time for Christmas.***This book was great. The characters were amazing, the plot was interesting, and Miss Brian did not disappoint. The novel was like one grand puzzle set and every piece fit together perfectly. I have to say, I had my doubts, considering that it was a normal novel and what I usually read are Paranormal Romances, and this fact leaves me very biased. The main character, Lila, was a bit hard to get accustomed to, her being an outright snob in the beginning of the book, and the way she treated her brother, and how she considered herself to be the highest of the high, well, it made her seem a tad bit immature. Well...I guess it's OK to say she put the IM in immature. But I'm glad that she makes amends in the end, and discovers that being herself is what matter's most. Her Ex, Beau, was amaaaaazziinnngg. Although, I, like Lila, sometimes got tired of his holier-than-thou attitude as well. But he brought out the best in Lila, and stuck up for her, and knew what made her tick and what made her laugh, which shows that he was and will always be the best choice for her. Both of these characters made this book even more lovable, and the trip they go on was hilarious and filled with memories that brought back the love they once had. The ending made me laugh and cry tears of joy, because even though it was highly predictable, it was just so much sweeter seeing it in print. So overall, like they say, all's well that end's well.

Leaving out an article claiming that global warming is melting the North Pole seems to be the perfect way to make him pay, but she never would have guessed that he\u2019d take off with his best friend Tyler in hopes of saving Santa from certain danger. To stay out of trouble, Lila absolutely has to get Cooper home before her parents find out, but the only person who can help her is Tyler\u2019s older brother Beau. The only problem is that Beau is Lila\u2019s anti-everything, slacker musician ex-boyfriend. Can Lila and Beau survive an epic road trip and get their little brothers home before time runs out?I struggled a little bit getting into the flow of this story because I found the main character, Lila, to be so highly unlikable. She\u2019s obsessed with her image and popularity at school, at the expense of her familial relationships, and I was horrified at how she treated her little brother and walked all over the other kids at school. That being said, having her so unlikeable in the beginning did allow for great character growth, and she did come out of the ordeal with some redeeming qualities in the end.Once the story got going and the road trip began with Beau and Lila, I became more invested in the story and ended up having a great time following their misadventures and near misses as they race against the clock to find their runaway siblings. Beau is an adorable love interest and I loved that he had interests outside of pop culture and image that drew Lila out of her narrow mindset. Beau simply made Lila a better person, and watching them grow to like each other again is a fun ride.This book has a little bit of everything, all wrapped up in a fun holiday package.

With Ex-mas I found not only that, but a fun road-trip between bickering exes!When we start the novel, we meet our main character Lila who is moments away from throwing THEE PARTY to be at. Basically, this party means everything to her popularity as it gives her a chance to stand on her own and not in a shadow of her 'best friend'. But after her college boyfriend bails due to a last minute 'final' (riiiight) and her little brother informs her parents of the party plans, her 'world' comes crashing down. Her brother has run off with his friend on a mission to save Santa and Lila, along with her ex-boyfriend, Beau, must hurry to get them back before her parents return. Lila is one of those characters that annoys the hell out of you in the beginning. She was shallow and completely self-absorbed. Her popularity and hopes for a car were all she cared about. Honestly, it took quite a bit for me to like her. And I am pretty sure when I did it was all due to Beau. That guy had the patience of a saint to put up with her on this road trip, and even after. I truly loved his character. He was sincere, sweet, selfless and incredibly caring. So basically the exact opposite of the Lila we are first introduced to. Now, as far as the plot goes, I found a lot of it to be predictable and far-fetched. But the thing is, it really didn't bother me much! Despite my earlier feelings for Lila, I was rooting for these two to find their way back together. There was still a spark lingering between them and I was anxious for it to be relit. The farther they raced to catch up with the little brothers, the more crazy obstacles that got in the way.

I started reading this book at... midnight? And I have just gobbled it up. I sent my friend a message with my predictions for the plot line and was right on the money. But you know what? Well played, Kate Brian. Although it was predictable and cheesy and had all of the same elements of any YA romance novel I've read before... I enjoyed it. And I could see that if I wasn't out of my teenage years and still in high school with all of the drama and ridiculousness, I could love this book all the more. The only extra thought I had when reading it was: why do people want to be popular? My understanding that popular means that the majority of the population likes you, where it seems that the image of the popular group that is displayed is a bunch of stuck-up bitchy girls and jock-asshole guys who get drunk, act like they're SO above everyone else, and generally look like they're having no fun. I was a 'geek' in high school (more like I knew I'd never be popular because I didn't have what it took, and I was completely fine with that) and really obsessed with Harry Potter. You know, to the point that I would dress up when I went to the movies. I remember one year wearing my costume to school (because that's how I roll) and one 'popular' girl made a bitchy comment about it. And I just remember thinking, \"How sad it must be for you to not be who you really are inside because you're so afraid of what people are going to think of you.\" Honestly, popularity? It seems to overrated and completely boring. At least I can be honest about my geekiness and true to who I am, instead of faking my way through life.

I read Megan Meade's Guide To The McGowan Boys and loved it! This one is just as good, if not better! We are introduced to Lila who has it all, college boyfriend, popular best friend, and all the guys want her and the girl's want to be her! We also are introduced to her annoying little brother Cooper. Well, things go down and Cooper thinks he needs to save Santa so Cooper and his friend Tyler take off to save Santa! Lila gets tangled up with Tyler's older brother Beau aka Lila's ex boyfriend and they have to go after them! Of course I liked Beau from the first mention. He was my kind of guy. The two youngsters hopped on a bus so now Lila and Beau have to drive 7 hours to find them! This book was a bit predictable in places but I still loved it! And the things I wanted to happen, some of them did happen! While others totally blew me away!!! This is the book to read around Christmas time, or even while the weather is still cold! Perfect book for this time of year!Overall: I loved it! Awesome book! It left me with a big grin on my face saying, awwwwww. I'm so happy! Rush to the store and buy this now! While you at it, also pick up Megan Meade's Guide To The McGowan Boys!Cover: This cover is amazing! I love it! I love the candy cane and its even shiny and pretty in person!"}, {"userName": "Em-em", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5074038-em-em", "userReview": "Lila is the popular girl who has a past and an ex boyfriend. Now that she has climbed the ladder of popularity it's time to glue herself in and make it permanent. And what better way to do that but with a grand christmas party and a popular boyfriend. Her plan was made but things started to fall out of place when her parents found out about her plan and her christmas-obsessed little brother decided to run off and save Santa from global warming with his friend Tyler. Now she has to go after her brother before her parents come home with the help of her ex boyfriend Beau. Will this rekindle old flames of love or finally burn the bridge between the two of them?ADORABLE! This is one ADORABLE love story. It is funny and sweet. There are a lot of frustrating moment in Lila's part though but it is totally understandable especially since she is trying to put distance between her and her ex boyfriend. But that is kind of hard to do when she is put into a place where it is only him that he can turn to. It was one heck of a chase. Who would have thought that chasing a kid across America can be this hard? Nevertheless it was one of those experiences that when Lila finally came out of she came out with new perception about her life and of the world.It is a simple love story. Similar to eating an ice cream in a hot weather. It makes you comfortable and soothes you from within."}, {"userName": "Jacqueline", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2557492-jacqueline", "userReview": "Ex-mas by Kate Brian is a cute read. Although I didn't get to reading it during the holiday season, I still enjoyed it in summer. The plot of the story was okay. Lila's little brother runs off with her ex-boyfriends little brother to save Santa from Global Warming. It was a cute little tale. I enjoyed watching Lila and Beau fight while they both kind of had feelings for each other. Chasing after two kids is not that easy. The kids are hard to find and once they are found, they move so fast that boom, they are gone again. The characters do develop pretty nicely in so much that their motives change and their attitudes change. I enjoyed Ex-mas and really wish that I'd read it during Christmas time. It's a fun one to read. I can just imagine reading it with a hot cup of cocoa next to you snugging up next to the fire. Outside in the hot sun works too, but if I were you I'd totally try that. Favorite character: Lila. She was a brat towards the beginning but then starts to have more soul and be more of herself. Crush: Beau. Her other guy is trouble. Beau actually helps her and they have a great connection. Book-a-likes: Tough one. I'd say probably something else by Kate Brian because I haven't read much holiday stuff. It's a sweet read. It really helps you appreciate little siblings and family. I recommend Ex-mas for those 12 and up. It was a fairly clean, and a good read."}, {"userName": "Lindsey Wasserman", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4598540-lindsey-wasserman", "userReview": "This was pretty stupid book. It was a light read, and didn't have much to it. I expected to like it because I really like Kate Brian, but I really hated it. It was about a girl, Lila, who is babysitting her brother the weekend winter break starts of her senior year of high school. She wanted to throw a huge party, but her brother caught her, and told her parents, and she had to cancel it. She accidentally mentions something to her brother about there being no Santa Clause, and him being little takes off with his best friend. His best friend happens to be the younger brother of Lila's ex boyfriend Beau. Beau and Lila go on an adventure to find their brothers. While on that journey, Lila catches her college boyfriend cheating on her. They go through a lot together, but the book was just boring. Almost the same thing kept happening over and over again. They were sooo close to their brothers, and then they lost them again. I forgot to mention that Lila's brother has Lila's phone, and whenever they call off of Beau's phone, the boys don't answer. They can't call the police though, because the police would have to contact their parents, but Beau doesn't want to put more on his single mother who is taking care of her sick relative. It was just kind of a stupid book."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2619063-samantha", "userReview": "Um. CUTEST book ever.I am crazy in love with Kate Brian. So much so, that if I lived in the US, I'd probably be banned from her signings because of the squealy-fangirling that I'd be doing at each one. I started with her Private series and quickly devoured every other book she had ever written [one of my favourites is The Princess and the Pauper). So, needless to say, when I heard of Ex-Mas, I hit the roof and lost my voice for 3 days. However, finances went downhill and then life got in the way and I never got round to reading it. So there I was Mid-May in the library, fangirling at the Christmas romance that I'd been dying to read. It's a very light, carefree read, Lila abandoned her old life for the world of the popular crowd 3 years ago and hadn't looked back until she found herself half way across the country with her Ex chasing after their (surprisingly smart) eight-year-old brothers -who have gone to save Santa *squeal*My only qualm is that I wished we'd got to see a little more of Beau and Lila together after the guitar chapter. That was the sweetest and my eyes would have appreciated that rather than stupid Erik being all \"blah, blah, I'm sorry\""}, {"userName": "Kayla", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3119530-kayla", "userReview": "I wanted to like this book, but if the main character is annoying, usually I find the entire book annoying. Lila has changed her entire persona in order to fit in with the popular crowd. That meant abandoning her long time friend and, for a short time, boyfriend, Beau, and creating a new image for herself.I don\u2019t like fake people. At all. So reading a book about a fake person was hard. Not only that, but the plot was incredibly predictable. There were a few cute moments, but there were also parts that just didn\u2019t make any sense to me.The story was a quick read. I picked it up for a bit of holiday cheer, and I suppose it was okay enough. The characters were flat and I never really connected to them. Lila was shallow and horrible to her brother [not that most sisters are nice, but telling your little brother Santa was in danger of loosing his home? Horrible.] and I found that I didn\u2019t care whether she found her brother before her parents got back.I give this 2/5 stars.

The book cover was somewhat appealing and simple, which I liked it. But... this book was incredibly weak and disappointing. I don't even know what I was expecting of Ex-mas, because I really didn't know anything about the author or the story, like I said just picked this book up due to the Christmas vibe. All the characters were stereotypes, they weren't properly developed. I couldn't empathise with any of them. To be honest, the only character who I liked and felt something towards to was Cooper, the eight-year-old Lila's brother. Everything was predictable in a way which was horrifically annoying. It's one of those books, which in a few days if someone asks me what's the story about, I will not be capable of remember a thing to say."}, {"userName": "Erica", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2366949-erica", "userReview": "4.5 Stars This book is too cute! I have loved all of Kate Brian's books that I've read - and this one was no exception! Ex-Mas is a fun, lighter read. I read Ex-Mas in one sitting. The writing is fantastic and the plot is adorable. It's actually rather predictable, but that's what makes it so great. I love how Ms. Brian weaves elements of lessons such as honesty, thankfullness, and just being yourself throughout the story. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the realistic factor of two 8 year olds getting on a train alone to several states away. That wouldn't really ever happen. Beau was my favorite character - he was down to earth and easy to relate to. Lila got on my nerves a few times. Cooper and Tyler were so cute! Cooper was so innocent, and just wanted to help Santa. I would definately recommend this book! It's one of those books that leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy after you finish reading."}, {"userName": "Rks", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38712098-rks", "userReview": "At the time I started this book, it was Christmas, and due to its festive theme, I was drawn to the book. I was intrigued by the cover and name, and was interested to see what it was look. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. With such a strong concept and title, I had high hopes for Brian, as she wasn't an author I had come across. However, the plot was weak and very predictable. It was clich\u00e9 and annoying, as a reader, because I wanted to be able to not know what I was going to read next, however I was disappointed and disheartened by the lack of originality in the story. The characters were very much similar to your classic young adult/teen book characters, and were weakly developed. I felt as though I couldn't empathise with any of them, which severely disheartened me to continue the book for a while. Once I had made it to the end, I was just glad it was over.
