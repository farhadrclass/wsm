Faulkner. Keep Faulkner in mind. Mind you, however I start, this will come to rage and spoilers. Also, language warning: Fuck IGN as putting this as their top choice for a top ten list of Shoujo manga. This is utterly not acceptable in the least, unless that list was a fucking troll post. Also I hate the heroine.I\u2019ll start on the art, to be fair. On the whole, your typical shoujo fare. Girls have big, watery eyes, guys are tall and long-limbed, children were ripped untimely from the cabbage patch\u2019s womb, but darn are they cute. Something that bothered me is that for a lot of backgrounds, it looks like they took their reference pictures and instead of tracing or drawing from a reference, the artist or assistants in charge just put some screen transfer solution onto the photo, pressed the manuscript to it, and peeled it away to be just blurry enough to look like there\u2019s a wet newspaper photograph jammed in the background of the artwork on the page. Stylistic choice? I can accept it. But I don\u2019t like it. The guys look average as well, but it is nice to see a few that aren\u2019t quite as skinny as most bishonen. So, all in all, the artwork gets about 3.5 stars, being barely above solid average, in my opinion, for good points balancing bad points within a sea of average.\u2026The\u2026 Nope. Can\u2019t talk about the Faulkner thing yet. Nope. The heroine? Yes, I think I can talk about her next. Dis bitch. Girl. You don\u2019t even.People complain a lot about the heroines of shoujo manga, that they are weak, cry at every little thing, and never stand up for themselves. Well, that\u2019s a perfect definition of this heroine! Her crying scenes could be a drinking game with a 65% mortality rate. It is her primary response to conflict, and good for her, because that\u2019s usually how she gets out of it anyway\u2014start crying, someone hugs you, the end. Nothing is actually resolved, because you are not talking about any of the sources of conflict, but that\u2019s another problem. Getting back to the heroine: I could not think of a way to possibly make her more stereotypical. Virginal, doesn\u2019t make the best grades, gullible, sweet, caring, shy, family-oriented, emotional, eventually has the exact same bangs that all the rest have (excuse my language, BUT IS IT A FUCKING DRESS CODE?). I submit to you that Bella Swan herself has more personal character than this bitch, and I am not even remotely joking.Another thing that both these ladies have going for them is abusive boyfriends! Except Edward Cullen just happens to hit 10/15 points on a list of signs for an abusive relationship, and Whatshisname from this series is just plain fucking abusive. From the beginning of the series until the end, he doesn\u2019t address the heroine but to call her some derivative of \u201cstupid.\u201d And she is stupid, by all means, but there is a difference between being literally not smart, and using that as an accusation when you are trying to rob someone of confidence and any will to resist you. He hits her whenever he is displeased with her, and once slaps her solidly on the face in front of a group of people (including his family and her brother), and I can\u2019t even remember exactly why now, and I read it yesterday\u2014look, the guy hit her a lot, it\u2019s hard to keep track.Please listen to me as I say: There is never a single point in this series where he considers her feelings, where he earnestly apologizes (or, I think, falsely apologizes), where he respects her boundaries, where he tries to be generous with her, or where he is even realistically reasonable with her. This is an utterly despicable man to whom it never occurs to treat a woman as something other than a possession. There is no character arc for him to even come close to think about changing. His concept of a relationship is that the girl will listen to whatever he says, never think about any other man (including brothers), never disobey him, always be completely accountable to him for everything, and even rely on him to buy things for her so she won\u2019t need to get an outside job and leave him to worry that she is conversing with men who aren\u2019t him for a period of time over one minute. I\u2019m not even fucking kidding.This. Man. Should. Not. Be.And this is actually a really simple point. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re supposed to look at him as having some character arc from cold indifference to having a position of power over her that amounts to molestation (An agreement for silence on a scandalous matter in exchange for being his \u201cslave\u201d does not make it any less molestation; see Scarpia Ultimatum for further reading) to such a \u201clove\u201d that he commands her to choose between him and her family on several occasions, withholds valuable information that is extremely important to her, and that he is somehow so preoccupied with her that he can\u2019t bring himself to bang a willing partner who is topless beneath him. No. Just fucking no.So, as far as characters for, we\u2019re 0-2! Oh, Tachibana\u2014that was the bastard\u2019s name. And Narita for the bitch he\u2019s after.One character that I find marginally acceptable\u2014by comparison to the others\u2014is Azusa. He is a shameless bastard who would knowledgably and willfully do utterly despicable things to an innocent girl in order to hurt her father when he was reasonably sure her father was the one who had done something horrible to his mother. Planned gang rape, from the rufees to the cameras to the men ready and willing to commit the act. There is no condoning this bastard, and it bothers me that Tachibana is the only one throughout the rest of the series who really has a problem with him\u2014and not that he was going to have Narita gang-raped, oh no! Because he\u2019s a threat to Tachibana\u2019s perfectly monogamous worldview of Narita. But the thing is, with Azusa there\u2019s actually a character arc that took him to being so fucked up. There\u2019s a beginning, a middle, and the story actually ends before it is all wrapped up his final revenge on the man who is actually responsible for screwing his mom over. Because wrapping up the actually dramatic character arc was less important than Will The Heroine End Up With The Complete Bastard? Yes, Yes She Will. Love him and/or hate him, Azusa was actually someone to be interested in. And as I write this, I remember actually being more interested in that stupid romantic conflict near the end (read: I wanted to see if the bastard would reform at all, if the\u2026 Faulkner\u2026 thing\u2026 would be a thing\u2026 and if the heroine would remain invertebrate for the rest of her life. Answer: No, sort of, yes.) Come to think of it, Azusa wasn\u2019t really actually that interesting outside of his own arc at the beginning or his couple dramatic confrontation moments afterwards. But I\u2019m clinging to positives here. So I will try my best to give this a character rating of pass. Even though it\u2019s not.1-3 on characters in Hot Gimmick.Not gonna talk about the Faulkner thing yet. Nope. Instead, I\u2019m going to talk about the story and wrap up the characters.This is a story about the social politics of living in a housing complex provided by the company that the father works for. The inciting moment that kicks off the conflict is that the Narita Family\u2019s second daughter Akane is a little junior high school slut who thinks she might be pregnant and skips school for a day because her period is late and she has to go through a list of all the boys she had recently screwed sans condom (leaving off the ones she\u2019d actually used protection with). Don\u2019t worry about this point, it will never come up again. So big sis, because she takes the shit for everyone in this series, goes out to buy a pregnancy test, and is found out by childhood friend and then figure of terror who had\u2014gasp\u2014once pushed her down a flight of stairs, leaving her scarred with a fear that will never actually come up. (I think the author confused \u201cfear\u201d with \u201creally fucking unpleasant memory.\u201d) So she hates and is terrified of this guy. Cool. But social politics are everything here, and so she needs him quiet about that pregnancy test (which isn\u2019t even needed when Big Sis gets home anyway, making this plot point\u2014say it with me now\u2014UTTERLY FUCKING POINTLESS!), and agrees to be his slave to protect her family. And Tachibana, being the seventeen year old male that he is, uses this power to his advantage for one thing: BEWBS! Because what else does the completely virgin top-student with all the money and power he wants supposed to do? But not just molestation, also bastard moves like forcing her to give up her first kiss to him in a public place. I know our heroine is the one this phrase is meant for, but OUR PROTAGONIST, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!When I was researching the series, things said that you just need to stick out the first volume\u2019s worth of chapters, because after that is when it gets good. This is actually bullshit. Because: The first few chapters, things are pretty clear. Trope filled as hell, but we get it. Then\u2026 after about that time, the story gets interesting, and you want to read more\u2014you want to see if you can trust Azusa, you want to see when Tachibana will make the shift from \u201cyou are my slave\u201d to \u201cI love you, I want you to be my girlfriend,\u201d and you want to see the heroine stick up for herself. Instead, you get a completely unreformed bastard Tachibana using the heroine and never giving one single damn for her past a single scene where he is trying to fill a litmus test for her definition of \u201cthis is when people become boyfriend and girlfriend.\u201d One scene is not enough to balance at least 50 of 54 chapters of utter bastardry. You get a heroine who is so wrapped up in her emotional conflicts that she never, ever, ever works towards resolution on any of them. You get a relationship founded on desire, control, tears, and some giddy attraction where there is never, ever a single serious exchange of ideas and ideals, never any kind of give-and-take, never both parties contributing and seeking the good of one another. You get Azusa attempting to commit an unforgivable crime and never suffering any consequences, and being boring when he does get time in the sun. You get some distracting chapters where Little Slut Sister is dumbed down to being flirty and popular (never a mention of her sexual partners again) with a distracting arc where she\u2019s trying to get with this adorable, earnest nerd guy who\u2019s extremely preoccupied with Gundam (bless).And you get incest.About half a series worth of IIINNNCEEEEEST~ being a major plot point. This is the thing I was using \u201cFaulkner\u201d as a euphemism for. But you see, The Sound and the Fury is a very smart book, and this is not a very smart series. With The Sound and the Fury, incest is the juxtaposition of sexuality, phobia of sexuality, unfitting societal and moral expectations, and illustration of kind of how fucked up Quentin is. There\u2019s already too much written about whether Quentin actually wanted his sister sexually or if he just wanted the ideals and to remain in celibate shame, but I will let those debates die with him in the river for the purposes of right now. Incest in Faulkner is sick, it\u2019s not condoned, but it\u2019s used smartly, in order to cause the audience a measured discomfort as it contributes to the story.I have no idea what the hell the author was going for with this, but that she really wanted to write an incest story and not have it be about incest.BUT I\u2019M SORRY, YOU CANNOT HAVE LINES LIKE \u201cI just did it [had sex] with onii-chan [big brother]\u201d AND HAVE IT BE OKAY. (Note: Just because she says it doesn\u2019t make it true.)And, I hear it now in my head, all of the people who say \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t actually her brother! He was adopted! It\u2019s not incest!No. They were raised as brother and sister. A form annulling the adoption doesn\u2019t change that. It is still incest. Romance and sex between members of close family is incest. This. Is. Incest.We first learn about Big Bro\u2019s feelings in a flashback panel where he\u2019s remembering praying to God, \u201cForgive me, I\u2019m in love with my own sister.\u201d I don\u2019t know if the writer wants us to ignore that when she later has him say \u201cI never once looked at you as my sister.\u201d Or y\u2019know, that time where he was like \u201cWe were kids, and then (illustration of her in a junior high school uniform) my feelings changed\u2026\u201dGod, you creepy fucking incestuous bastard.And that above is my clinical reaction. Because he\u2019s a bang-up guy in the series! No, really! I\u2019m not okay, okay? He\u2026 I\u2026 I appreciate and am as devoted to truly nice guys as much as stupid teenage girls are often mindlessly devoted to Byronic heroes, antiheroes, and bad boys. And this incestuous bastard is the best guy in the series. NOT FOR THE HEROINE, GOD FUCKING NO, NEVER FOR THE HEROINE. But as a guy. He\u2019s so devoted, hardworking, nice, tolerant, caring, and giving that he\u2019s utterly unreal. BUT YOU SICK FUCKER YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH YOUR OWN SISTER WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU. NO.And here\u2019s a real issue: The end of the series is pretty much devoted to whether she will choose to be with her Complete Bastard boyfriend who lies to her, hides things from her, berates her, constantly pressures her for sex, hits her, commands her what to do, never shows a single care for her, and is mindlessly jealous over her\u2014or will she end up with this other guy, who is super nice, and her sick-as-fuck mother approves of her being with (Seriously, Mom, what the actual literal incestuous fuck?), who has been devoted to her for years, who makes her happiness a priority, who will take care of her and listen to her, oh and the only problem is that he\u2019s her brother (oh, but not really, because he\u2019s adopted!)?There is no win in this situation. I don\u2019t want her to get together with her brother, no matter how nice or great he is, because he is her brother. She never drops off the \u201cbrother\u201d honorifics, not even when she is taking off her clothes and asking him to fuck her. And in the end when the other guy is commanding her to marry him as soon as he turns eighteen, nothing will ever change. He will always be a controlling, selfish asshole. The only thing he has going for him is that she feels attracted to him. She is sixteen experiencing what is her first time actually being in love. (Not counting Azusa because that lasted two or three days and ended in attempted gang rape. Bastard.) \u201cBut I love Tachibana\u201d is not good enough, you stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid girl.But it will be. They will get married, and he will control her, and she will cry, and things will go on as always, because he sure as hell won\u2019t let her ever get a divorce.Which brings us to the end of the review, and me explaining that \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d I don\u2019t know why I read this series through to the end. I guess I needed to see if the author\u2019s desperate \u201cTHIS TOTALLY ISN\u2019T INCEST!\u201d would remotely fly. I guess I wanted to see the heroine crash and burn and choose Tachibana. I wanted to see Azusa\u2019s final reaction to knowing who really hurt his mother. I guess I just finished the series because in the middle, it was good-ish, and I really wanted to see where it went. And then when it got really, really bad, I needed to finish so I wouldn\u2019t have to think about it anymore.Don\u2019t read this series\u2014that\u2019s my recommendation. I have had coffee stronger than this heroine, and black coffee sweeter than her fianc\u00e9. The author tries to pass off incest as though it isn\u2019t (and don\u2019t try to tell me that the Japanese public would be just dandy with this as their representation of wholesome relationships for adoptive families), and the writing is mediocre at best. Read something where all the heroes aren\u2019t bastards, and the heroine is something other than a doormat. Don\u2019t start, because if you start you\u2019ll want to finish, and if you finish, you\u2019ll be left with buckets of things you hated, and buckets of \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just don\u2019t know\u201d to make it go down easier.Those buckets of \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d give this series two stars instead of one. I want to give it one star to balance out five-star ratings, but I can\u2019t do that. This volume at least is better than many of the others (no it kind of isn\u2019t), but I\u2019m going for the whole series, and the whole thing is a stupid, misogynistic two-star.EDIT: It is now one year later, and I am removing the second star in order to balance out the series of five star ratings which I can hold no allowance to. One star, though my above assessment is probably more accurate."}, {"userName": "Courtney Wells", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19433724-courtney-wells", "userReview": "...I feel depraved that I loved this series.

So I was happy when, in the final volume, she finally decided to be with Ryoki once and for all. AND YET. We had 11 volumes of buildup for their relationship. 11 volumes of foreplay. But when they finally have sex, it's a rushed, fade-to-black matter. Afterward, there are no more sweet moments between them. Just a few pages featuring the rest of the characters, and then a super abrupt ending with Hatsumi and Ryoki barely making an appearance. What the actual hell? And then there's a bonus story with Akane and Subaru, which I didn't even care about because I was so let down by the ending. No, Ryoki and Hatsumi's relationship did NOT change for the better, but since they shared several swoony moments throughout the series, I was expecting at least a secret smile or something.

It doesn't. Even after a few years of coming to understand how 'submissive' characters in manga can be strong or the physical abuse metaphorical or the sacrifice is because of their great love for the dominant, this story is still unacceptable. The physical abuse is real, the girl hates it but is too terrified to speak up, and the guy never drops his pride enough to show his affection. It is horrible and I hate Viz for ever printing it. In case you were wondering, I adore 'Itazura na Kiss' and a number of other series with a strong power imbalance because the characters still push each other to grow.

Anyway, pretty much the whole thing pisses me off, because the series is pretty much entirely about Hatsumi being taken advantage of by every single guy in her life. Hatsumi herself seems to have no ability to see through dishonesty, willpower to resist romantic attacks or strength. This series is where feminism goes to die.Guy #1: Ryouki. At the outset, we are introduced to Hatsumi, who is the slave to the stern, bullying, sexually harassing, glasses-wearing guy who lives in her building. Why? Because he caught her buying a pregnancy test for her younger sister. If he tells his mother, who controls the housing complex, her family would get kicked out. So, of course, this gives him the right to try to force her to have sex with him. I think we're supposed to like him, because it's obvious that he's really into her and is only treating her like shit because he doesn't know how to handle his emotions. Yeah, not feeling that AT ALL.Guy #2: Azusa. He's Hatsumi's childhood friend, who would try to protect her from Ryouki's bullying. His family just moved back to town and he's supporting her again. They quickly start dating, because he's so sweet and hot (model), and she's had enough of putting up with Ryouki (only she still lets him do whatever he wants). Except, le shock!, Azusa is actually just dating her to piss off someone to get vengeance for something. Awesome.Guy #3: Shinogu. Presenting the only nice guy in the series. Surprise! He's her brother. Okay, so they're not actually siblings by blood, but they have been raised that way. He knows they're not related and has been in love with her forever, but she doesn't know, so sees him just as her brother. Clearly, he would be her best choice despite the super awkwardness that would be involved, however, he also has no shot because he's been raised as her brother. Isn't it lovely that dating her brother is what you have to root for, because everyone else is just trying to rape her or seduce her to their own ends?When it comes down to it, though, this series is very readable, in the same way that a lot of very frustrating books are (think Twilight or maybe this Fifty Shades of Grey I've heard about). Clearly, women are useless, stupid clumsy creatures to be fought over and/or won by studly males. Ugh! As much as I hated that, the story moves along at a swift pace and I do like the art. Thus the 2.5, which I kind of hate myself for.If you like strong heroines and respectful menfolk, do not read this. However, if you want to read something to prepare you for a feminist rant, this will definitely get you fighting mad."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3450330-katie", "userReview": "Out of the frying pan and into the fire!This is just what Hatsumi\u2019s day has been like. She goes from trying to buy a pregnancy test for her sister without anyone seeing her to becoming the slave of the person she hates most in the world. The story itself is pretty fast paced with a lot of surprises thrown in. It was definitely a book with a lot of emotions both for the characters and the readers themselves. There were many times where I wanted to stop reading because I was so angry at certain people in the book, but I always came back for more. All in all it was a fun and intense read that will put you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions, but it also gets you thinking and can really pull at your heartstrings.Hatsumi is a sweet girl and I really empathized with her a lot. She has a big heart, but sometimes it can get her into a little trouble. All in all I really liked her character and will continue to root for her as the series progresses. She is one of those characters that really steal your heart and I can\u2019t wait to find out how the rest of her story goes.The other main character is Ryoki who is not one of my favorites. He is a very interesting character in his own right though. He can be a bit overbearing at times, but he also has a sweet side to him that shows through at just the right moments. It is plain to see for me anyway that he really does care for Hatsumi in his own way. I\u2019m not quite sure where things will go in this series, but I hope I get to see a little more about him and his back story in later volumes.Overall this is a fun read that Shojo fans should definitely pick up!"}, {"userName": "Brigitte", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2567414-brigitte", "userReview": "Hot Gimmick is about a girl named Hatsimi. She has a sister who thinks she might be pregnant, so she asks Hatsimi is she will get her a pregnancy test. But right after buying it, Hatsimi runs into her creepy neighbor who is now blackmailing her to be his sex slave or else he will tell everyone about her slut sister.Hatsimi's main external conflict is her creepy neighbor who is blackmailing her, her main internal conflict is if she should be his sex slave, of is she should let him sellout her sister.  I can connect this book to the world. In the world there are people in the same situation as Hatsimi, they are being blackmailed into doing something that they don't want to do. All of their reasons are different, but they are all being forced to do the same thing. Hatsimi is not alone. I give this book four stares because it has a real life charm that makes it completely interesting. All kinds of readers can read this book. It has something for everyone."}, {"userName": "Nadia", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8459872-nadia", "userReview": "I often see this manga around and though the synopsis seems interesting, I never felt the urge to buy it since: 1.) I didn't like the cover art so I assumed I wouldn't like the art inside the book either and 2.) the only volumes available are the omnibus editions which are quite expensive. However, when I came upon a copy of volume 1 in Booksale I decided to give it a try out of curiosity. (Besides, it was also cheap.)What a surprise - the art style inside is rather pretty. Not out and out pretty by CLAMP's or Tanemura's standards but subtly so. The story is engaging but some elements of it remind me of other manga (namely Hana Yori Dango) though I'll definitely want to read more of this series if only to see where it's headed."}, {"userName": "Gulen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10337007-gulen", "userReview": "Klasik \u00e7ocuk senden nefret ediyorsa, sana eziyet ediyor, senin zay\u0131f y\u00f6n\u00fcn\u00fc (paraya ihtiya\u00e7 vb) sana kar\u015f\u0131 kullan\u0131p seni kendine k\u00f6le ediyor ise, olur olmaz yerde seni s\u0131k\u0131\u015ft\u0131r\u0131p taciz ediyorsa asl\u0131nda sana delice a\u015f\u0131kt\u0131r inanc\u0131n\u0131n hakim oldu\u011fu seri, elbette k\u0131z\u0131m\u0131za pek\u00e7ok erkek a\u015f\u0131kt\u0131r, elbette k\u0131skan\u00e7l\u0131klar vb. olacakt\u0131r.

I don't know, the art is decent and it's a page turner despite being quite disturbing plot and character-wise. This came recommended on a few lists, and maybe it's just because it's crazy popular? Harem manga CAN be fun if done well but I don't know that any of the male characters are super likeable, except maybe Subaru, who's mostly kind of sad. And Akane I can't say I like at all, which is a problem since Hatsumi kills herself to protect her privacy. I think I'll probably put this lower on my list of manga series to continue reading, but at least I've read it so I can have some idea about it. The target audience is clearly teens but I don't think I could in good conscience recommend it to them, it deals with heavy topics in a pretty flippant way.
