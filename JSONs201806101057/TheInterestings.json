Wolitzer wrote in such an ironic, lofty fashion that I was completely distanced from the characters. Very little actually happens in this novel, unless you count life, and that happens to all of us and does not a novel make. Six teens meet at summer camp, and four of them remain friends for decades. The friends deal with successes and failure, various love affairs, and one scandal, which is the central plot point of the novel (yet is never discussed or resolved in any meaningful way). Even though the novel spans the 70s through the present day, there is no tangible development or sense of time or place. The 70s might as well be the 90s. The \"World Wide Web\" is mentioned once, and that's about it. The reader never gets grounded in a setting. Even the summer camp where the friends meet, and which is supposedly instrumental to their lives, is barely sketched. Overall, the storyline doesn't amount to much. The book plods along, and we are told over and over that so-and-so is funny or charming, but we are never shown. Jules, the central character, is supposed to be the funny one in the group, for example, but nothing she says is actually funny. I never felt like I knew her, only a caricature of her, and the caricature was not likable. Jules is wishy-washy, superficial, petty, and jealous. The more minor interesting characters, like Jonah or Cathy, aren't developed at all. Jonah is the token gay friend who has trouble forming attachments. Cathy is the token needy girl. Goodman (get it?), who is not good at all, is the burly, good-looking, dumb dude who drinks a lot (his character, on whom the main plot point hinges, is so woefully undeveloped as to be laughable). Wolitzer is obsessed with external appearances. Ethan, who grows up to be rich and famous, is ugly, and we're told that his children are lucky not to look like him; we are told how ugly he is over and over, and Wolitzer focuses in excrutiating detail on his stockiness, his sour smell, his bad hair, his sweat, his eczema. Jules is also plain with frizzy hair. Jonah is beautiful (as is his partner, Robert Takahashi, who is infuriatingly referred to by his full name nearly every time he's mentioned as if the fact that he's Japanese-American somehow makes Wolitzer cool and multi-cultural). Ash is beautiful and fragile and basically perfect. Cathy has big hips and big breasts, and so on, ad nauseum. All the characters are strangely awkward and have an odd, abstract self-awareness that just didn't resonate as true. They all speak in a stilted tone, much like the tone of the novel, and are not fully fleshed out.Much of the writing is clunky and heavy-handed, and the novel jumps back and forth in time between the mid-70s and the present; some of these leaps are confusing, and there is a lot of unnecessary detail. I also don't think I've ever read less-sexy sex than what Wolitzer dished out in The Interestings. There is talk of anuses and penises and breasts, all of it at once clinical yet bizarrely juvenile. At one point, Jules watches a new love interest walk up to his loft and notices his heavy balls and the slit of his puckered anus. I'm being kind in paraphrasing here. The original is much worse, and the novel is full of such passages. Who thinks this during the excitement of a sexual moment? And why do we need to be privy to such random thoughts? Why spend two paragraphs talking about someone's anus but mention 9/11 as an afterthought in one sentence?"}, {"userName": "Stephen King", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26367680-stephen-king", "userReview": "A group of adolescents\u2014little more than children, really\u2014meet at a camp where kids explore their creativity.

The Social Security Life Expectancy calculator informs me that I\u2019ve lived half my anticipated span. The tired maxim encourages me not to think of the years in my life, but the life in my years. Now that I\u2019m marooned in middle age for a spell, I\u2019ve been thinking an awful lot about the life in the years ahead of and behind me. Have I achieved something of value in my work, my relationships? Is what I do enough to sustain me intellectually and emotionally for the next forty-four years? Do I measure up to my peers? Am I happy? Am I interesting? This quest for fulfillment and self-actualization is the premise of Meg Wolitzer\u2019s sprawling, cracking good novel The Interestings.In the summer of \u201974, Julie Jacobson, a middle class average achiever from a non-descript upstate New York town, earns a spot at an exclusive arts camp in New England. She is selected to enter the inner circle of the five coolest kids in camp, each a precocious, urbane specimen bred in the hipness of New York City. Julie becomes Jules and we follow her and those five other teenagers for the next thirty years.Jules is obsessed with the self-dubbed The Interestings -the talented and/or privileged people to whom she devotes so much emotional energy. The cult of personalities made me squeamish at times\u2014I wanted her to walk away from the past and create a life of her own. But her devotion to their supposed ideal reveals one of the truths of human nature\u2014we hang onto the golden coming-of-age memories, hoping those few perfect moments of childhood will carry us through the disappointment of growing up. It took me a long time to track on the Jules Vibe. I never quite believed in her intimate friendship with Ash Wolf, the faerie child around whose axis the group of friends spins. Nor did I fully embrace Ethan\u2019s constancy of passion for her. She just wasn\u2019t, ironically, that interesting. Even her physical presence remained shadowy for me. The others I could picture perfectly\u2014lumbering, awkward Ethan; delicate, perfectly formed Ash; bombshell Cathy; finely etched, beautiful Jonah with his sweep of long, dark hair; golden God turned bloated addict Goodman. But Jules, other than her unruly hair, remained indistinct.Yet, as she matured, growing into her role as friend, counselor, wife and mother, Jules begins to take shape. She became the character I most wanted to get stuck in the middle of a book with. Which is the genius of Wolitzer\u2019s narrative\u2014the novel\u2019s most enigmatic character becomes its core strength.Not that you\u2019ll get stuck in this book. Despite its length and scope, The Interestings impels the reader with sparkling dialogue and description. I did tread water with some lengthy expository and flashback episodes, but it easily becomes one of those books you just can\u2019t set down. If you say you don\u2019t compare your external successes and failures (e.g. material possessions, presumed income, job, weight, health, marital status, kids\u2019 college admissions, job prospects) with your circle of peers, I say \u201cmore power to you.\u201d Forgive me if I don\u2019t believe you. Meg Wolitzer probably wouldn\u2019t believe you, either. It\u2019s what we do, we flawed, insecure, fickle humans. We\u2019re hard-wired to want what we ain\u2019t got. But we can learn to accept what we\u2019ve been given. Do The Interestings? Read and find out. I\u2019m five years too young to fall within the brackets of the Baby Boomer generation (cut-off birth year is 1964), and ten years younger than the main characters of The Interestings, but I can relate to many of the novel\u2019s cultural reference points and Jules Jacobson\u2019s feeling that she just missed out on the badge of cultural honor bestowed those who came of age in the late \u201960s. I\u2019ve walked away from traditional success a few times, always choosing the interesting over expected. Perhaps because I fear the fall from lofty heights will be harder to recover from than the soft bounce of relative obscurity. Perhaps I\u2019m just lazy. Here\u2019s to the second half of the journey."}, {"userName": "Chaitra", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9086236-chaitra", "userReview": "[rapist (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "switterbug (Betsey)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843912-switterbug-betsey", "userReview": "Meg Wolitzer\u2019s captivating new novel, set in the bustle and exuberance of New York, is a panoramic and epic drama, but a sleeper kind of epic. It gripped me by degrees, opening rather conventionally and then gradually seducing me with a fertile character development and realistic, original story. She penetrates the messiness of human lives with a spotless narrative that feels both familiar and singular. If you are drawn to human drama, you\u2019ll soon be thoroughly hooked. This is surely the crown of Wolitzer\u2019s writing career.Six teenagers meet at a co-ed arts camp in the Berkshires in 1974 and remain in touch through the years (up to the present). A few become close intimates, and all of them maintain a lifelong bond. They each have a creative talent that they endeavor to nurture--dance, animation, architecture, theater, music. Art/creativity is the altar at which most of them strive and sacrifice to achieve artistic grace and ingenuity. But some are more successful than others in translating a talent into a career, and in identifying the difference between desire and aptitude. Although THE INETRESTINGS is an ensemble piece, aspiring stage actress, Jules Jacobson, stands out as the moral touchstone of the novel. We wholly inhabit her head and heart. Although her life is the most recognizably routine, she resonates acutely in the narrative. Occasionally, she covets her friends\u2019 successes, and she struggles at times to be charitable in her thoughts, but in spite of herself, Jules possesses an incorruptible archness and mettle. Artistically, she aims for a Lucille Ball comic timing, but her delivery promptly falls flat. Awkward and spontaneous, she has a tough and vulnerable elasticity that fuels the story. She\u2019s injured, imperfect, but even at her most astray, there\u2019s something of the shepherdess in her.Waifish Ash Wolf, the Yale-bound dramatic actress, is sister to Goodman, the robustly masculine but lugubrious, lazy, wannabe architect. They come from privileged roots, and their NY apartment and cultured parents become a meeting place for the six friends during off-camp season.Ethan Figman, homely and flat-nosed, is nevertheless the ambassador of the group, and the most obviously talented. His Fig Land animation/characters demonstrate the work of a genius. Jonah Bay is the son of a famous, Judi Collins-like folksinger. He has delicately attractive features, and is quiet and thoughtful, but troubled.Cathy Kiplinger--full-breasted and extroverted, and fearlessly sexy, came to the camp on scholarship, and dreams of a career in dance.A seventh main character emerges, an outsider who becomes an insider, and even eclipses some of the primary group of six, but I don\u2019t want to give anything away by even naming him or her. However, it is from this person that a new perspective of the group and its bond are viewed. The book\u2019s power is both its sweeping scope and the magnification of everyday life. It is best to read this novel without any preparation or peek inside.Distinctly drawn characters propel the action. You will forget that there is an author between you and the story, because rather than being \u201cnotified,\u201d the reader sharply observes the coalescing of the characters' individual natures and the connection between the friends. There\u2019s no skipping to contrived plot points, and the story never intrudes with an authorial voice. Both stout and potent, the narrative doesn\u2019t rely on gimmicks or typical arcs and milestones. You engage through an accretion of details and everyday events, rather than through trumped-up epiphanies. However, one seismic event causes tremors and fissures that divide some characters and bring others together. We engage more and more as time passes and the characters grow.Ambition, desire, success, jealousy, and envy shape the mortal coils of friendship, love, and loyalty, and figure importantly in the story, as do coming to terms with strengths and limitations. Moreover, mental health issues are addressed with keen awareness and insight. Much of the novel is a fluent progression of days and moments, strung brilliantly together. As observers, we get a ground view, and occasionally a bird\u2019s eye view of events, but we inhabit the narrative as if we are inside the story. The novel goes back and forth in time with a fluid and seamless momentum that kept me turning the pages well into the wee hours of the night. Consummately satisfying, interesting, and more.A+"}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7574349-melanie", "userReview": "So.

I was sucked in by the opening chapters, a group of friends, a summer camp much like my own, only half a generation older than me. I even recognized the types: the serious beautiful girl, the nerdy but well loved creative boy, the awkward girl making her way through on humor (me), the gorgeous arrogant boy... I could give each of these characters names from my own camp experience. And I could picture the Wolfs' New York: the big Central Park apartment, Ethan at Stuyvesant, the scary 80s streets, the first days in the East Village, walk up apartments... It's so seductive to see your own life chronicled, if a few years off, and made into the stuff of literature and saga. And I was also interested in Wolitzer's themes of adult life. In the difference that class and money can make between liefelong friends, something that probably bears more thinking about than I care to do. About what it means that some of us in middle age have \"made it\" and others of us have not. About what happens to childhood dreams that remain inevitably unfulfilled. So I was a good audience for this book. A summer camp goer, a New Yorker who vividly remembers the 80s, and someone whose closest friends are still, not summer camp, but the little group that formed a few years later in college. I did enjoy that element of the book - the luxury of self-recognition (to a point), the check boxes of common memory of our city (squeegee men, the Central Park Jogger, Giuliani, the first tech boom, 9/11, etc. etc.). But that is where she left me. Wolitzer is not a good writer on a sentence or paragraph level. Her prose plods. But more importantly, I utimately couldn't buy her central premise: that we carry our unfulfilled teenagers closely inside us and that those nasty jealous envious insecure creatures dictate the flows and rhythms of our adult life. It's not reflected in my own life, thank God, or those of my friends, except in a few very sad cases. Her dramatic conceit requires us to accept that the traumas and passions of 15 play a large role in who we are at 50. That may be true on an unconscious level, but Wolitzer plays that out on a very literal level. You envied this person then, you envy them more now. I hazard a guess that life could not be lived sanely that way. Most of life happens to you after adolescence - that's just mathematical. And for most people outside of novels, inevitable...and healing.  So I don't believe in her central characters. I just didn't believe that Jules could live in that bubble of longing for the heady days of what she desired during that summer of 15 for so long, without growing or changing. I think Wolitzer meant to convey the banal tragedy of middle age, a woman like the rest of us, who saw stars and glamour at 15 but then had to settle down to ordinariness. But instead of poignant, Jules just seemed irritating and shallow, and Wolitzer seems to enjoy giving her her come uppance as well, not an appealing situation for the main character of a long novel. On the other hand, Jonah - perhaps the most interesting character - is sadly relegated to the sidelines, only popping up here and there as a walk on in the ultimately boring drama of Jules and Ethan.Finally, I don't want to spoil, but there's an anachronistic date rape right at the center of this book. I would like to believe that the New York police in 1976 would have responded so seriously to an ambiguous maybe-rape-maybe-consensual-sex of a drunk and high teenager by her privileged white ex-boyfriend. But I know that wasn't true then, and it's probably barely true now. (Wolitzer name checks the Jennifer Levin murder - which happened a full ten years later - where the victim was blamed for getting herself dead (slut, she liked it rough, etc.) without accounting for what that means for her central drama). It's a nice plot engine. But unfortunately one that doesn't ring true - not in 1976 anyway."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "Here's what occurs to the separate & disparate destinies (that don't always simply intertwine) of the Interestings. Some of them become insanely rich, successful, even famous, while others do not. They predictably fall behind: herein, pathos. But every member of that group of artsy folk, their decisions, shape what ultimately becomes the final picture-- engineering their fates in compelling and irrefutable ways.Wolitzer's beloved novel takes the torch from other contemporary dramas about several coming-of-ages going on at once, like \"The Marriage Plot\" (make no mistake, the Jeffrey Eugenides stamp in form of a positive review on the cover is one major selling device), The Art of Fielding, and Freedom. Here, great events occur to people who have high expectations of themselves and their lives. Some reach something BEYOND fame, fortune, or the American Dream; they reach PERMANENCE. And for the reader, only to finish the book to reach that love-it-or-hate-it final sentence, so innately perfect, well, it's a real treat.This is the type of novel that you & I both go very deeply gaga over.

So, welcome to your life, as portrayed by other people. I was very close to abandoning this book, because it just didn't go anywhere, offers no hope, and sheds no insight into life.

THE INTERESTINGS is a book of great depth and insight. It follows six characters who meet at summer camp in 1974 up through the present--along with, to varying degrees, new friends, new relationships, and family members. Although there are many historically resonant moments, more than anything this is a book about character growth and development. I am not the only one who has compared this book to the works of Jonathan Franzen and Jeffrey Eugenides. Such comparisons are helpful only on the superficial level that I remember vividly the details of the books, characterization, and themes of these novelists and I will remember \"The Interestings\" as well. In short, people are realizing that Wolitzer is a first-rate novelist.The genius of the novel is that is shows such different characters, who are well-developed, as they grow and change against the backdrop of history but more importantly against the backdrop of the Great Themes of Human Life. Friendships. Family. Talent. Loyalty. Lies. Truths. Illness. Depression. Passion. Parenthood. The work-place. Money. Jealousy. Death.One of the reasons that the books is so successful is the character of Jules (a woman). She is the primary character and we get her point of view much more frequently than that of any other. We come to know,trust, and (mostly) respect her point of view as she grows and matures, and reflects upon the people in the world about her.Wolitzer's writing is deliciously complex. She has the ability to bring a fantastic sense of humor to bear alongside the more tragic and weighty events of the novel. She's got a deft ability to create newand exciting metaphors and to make vivid comparisons.I can guarantee that this book will be, in December, prominent on the Best Books of 2013 lists. I am also planning to read some of her earlier works . The last review I submitted here was about a popular, well-reviewed book (The Uninvited Guests) that I know I won't remember. I will remember this one. Like Franzen and Eugenides, mentioned earlier, I would put this book in the tradition of the solid and memorable literary realism that was perfected by the great 19th century novelists Austen, Dickens, Eliot, Trollope, and Thackeray.Some reviews say that they cannot identify with the characters or that the characters are not likeable. I have never read in that way. I don't read looking for characters to admire or to like but instead I like for characters who can provide insight to the vast panoply of the human condition. Shakespeare's Hamlet instructs the players to hold \"the mirror up to nature: to show virtue her feature, her scorn, her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure.\" Wolitzer has done a spectacular job of holding up the mirror to human nature of the past 40 years."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "\"From this day forward, because we are clearly the most interesting people who ever fucking lived ... because we are just so fucking compelling, our brains swollen with intellectual thoughts, let us be known as the Interestings.

The friends met in 1974 at a summer camp for the arts, and the book mostly focuses on the perspective of Jules Jacobson, a wannabe actress who uses comedy to ingratiate herself with the Interestings, which also include serious actress Ash, illustrator Ethan, musician Jonah, dancer Cathy, and Goodman, who lacks talent but makes up for it in arrogance. The book jumps around in time a bit, sometimes flashing back to someone's childhood, sometimes jumping ahead a decade. When I started this book, I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. The characters and dialogue could be a bit precious, but I so related to Jules that I wanted to keep reading to find out what happened to her.

Her fingers hovered over the keyboard. Oh, the angst.Was it her? Should she list her fifty insecurities in homage to the bizarre self-awareness of these characters, who spent so much time contemplating their navels it was a wonder none of them was ever hit by a car? Oh, dear. Was that a spoiler? No, it wasn't a spoiler. Now, where were we? Have we made much progress with this review?Okay. Let's move the plot along here. We'll start with the main character, Julie, who became Jules in camp that summer. The summer she met a bunch of privileged teens and was immediately adopted into her group. This was because Jules was funny and charming, as the author keeps telling us. It's always a risk to have a character whom you want to be funny and charming, she thought. You have to be sufficiently funny and charming yourself to create a character whose humor and appeal are believable. It's like writing a novel about a character who's a genius and needing that character to impress the reader with lots of smart insights. But what if you weren't so smart yourself?Similarly, she thought, the author kept telling the reader how great that camp experience was. Was it in fact? She kept reading it, but did she believe it? So through the book the characters took a number of twists and turns. Viewpoints shifted, as we moved from one angsty head into another. Most of the novel took place from the neck up, although when the characters enjoyed romantic encounters the reader was treated to highly graphic, clinical descriptions of body parts and what they were doing.

I'm still sitting with the smile on my face I had when I finished the last page. This book was so touching and beautiful and true and it went straight to my heart. Basically, this book is about a group of children getting to know each other at a summer camp. We then follow each individual throughout their lives and that's it! I can see why some people would have some problems with this book because it is quite slow-going and nothing big happens. But in my opinion, this is a masterpiece. It is exactly the kind of story I love and appreciate because it has the most beautiful storyline and characters. I've rarely read books with this amazing set of characters that you felt for and completely understood. Meg Wolitzer did an amazing job with everyone; throughout the day I was thinking about Jules and Jonah and all the other amazing persons that are part of this story. I love how this is a book about life: our failures, hopes, loves and how everything develops. Meg Wolitzer starts a chapter with one angle, she then continues with going into something happening in the past and you kind of forget about the original angle until the end of the chapter where everything wraps up. All of the book consisted of these narratives within narratives and I was in awe. Definitely check out this book and READ IT if you think it sounds interesting (pun intended ;-) ). I am still in awe and breathless after this most wonderful, fictional journey this book took me on."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10762033-maureen", "userReview": "I really honestly enjoyed this book. It is super engrossing and almost felt like watching a movie and seeing how things all played out. I loved the flawed characters and how their decisions felt real, I loved how the story jumped around in different time periods, and I really liked the story overall. These characters felt like people you might know or already know, even though their lives are so different from yours.Overall pretty great if you enjoy literary fiction! Solid read.PS I listened to the audiobook and loved that telling of the story. The author did different voices for the characters that actually seemed real and not cheesy and weird. 10/10 would recommend."}, {"userName": "Glenn Sumi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi", "userReview": "The Interestings is a big, beautiful and utterly absorbing novel about art, friendship, love, life and mortality. It also deals with something rarely seen in fiction: envy. In the mid-1970s at an arts-oriented summer camp in upstate New York, six precocious kids bond over music, V&Ts (vodka and Tang) and a bit of pot. They each have gifts \u2013 some more defined than others \u2013 and insecurities. They call themselves \u201cthe interestings,\u201d because, well, they are, and they\u2019re convinced they\u2019re going to do great things in the fields of music, animation, acting, dance, etc.Needless to say, it doesn\u2019t work out for all of them. Over the years then decades, real life intervenes, rent and student loans need to be paid. Careers are pursued and then, sometimes, abandoned. As Jules Jacobson, an aspiring comic actor, muses after countless unsuccessful auditions and one stinging putdown by a bitchy acting teacher:\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to keep giving this whole thing a try. But how long do I put myself out there? \u2026 What about auditioning? Do I keep on doing it? When do I stop? When I\u2019m twenty-five? Thirty? Thirty-five? Forty? Or right this minute? Nobody tells you how long you should keep doing something before you give up forever. You don\u2019t want to wait until you\u2019re so old that no one will hire you in any other field either. I already feel kind of worn out by it all and I\u2019ve basically just started.\u201d\nOuch. As a critic who\u2019s watched promising actors, directors and comics either climb the ladder to success and fame or toil away unrecognized until they flame out, change careers or disappear, I can relate. Talent is only one factor in success; perseverance counts, and so does luck. It also helps to have rich parents.All of those things come up in The Interestings, but the novel also touches on how success and trauma change people, how love can be deeper between friends than lovers, how families become like fortresses, and how our infatuations can stay with us until we\u2019re eventually confronted with brutal reality. Wolitzer\u2019s ingenious narrative can catapult us decades forward, and then go back, so the mystery in the book isn\u2019t \u201cWhat happens to these people?\u201d but \u201cHow did these things happen?\u201d and \u201cWhy?\u201d There is an event that severs the group early on, leaving many questions unanswered, but Wolitzer comes back to it eventually, very gracefully. Line-by-line, she is such a good writer. Here\u2019s one random sentence from late in the book: \nThey slapped backs again in that awkward way of middle-aged men who ache to hug but have already hugged too recently.\nAs with any book set in a certain time and place, Wolitzer tries to put in significant historic details to have her characters respond to: Watergate, religious leader Sun Myung Moon\u2019s mass wedding at Madison Square Garden, the first appearances of AIDS, changing medications for depression, 9/11 and its aftermath. At times these feel dutifully checked off rather than organic parts of the book. But The Interestings is full of warmth, life and compassion. They say we don\u2019t feel things as intensely as we do when we\u2019re adolescents. Wolitzer makes us relive those feelings in the early parts of the book and then artfully adds the layers of complexity and understanding that we learn when we get older."}, {"userName": "Kress", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58342-kress", "userReview": "I. Loved. This. Book.It was everything good in one rainbow-striped package. Maybe it's because I read so much young-adult fiction, but it felt like a book about growing up--but set when the real growing up begins. Unlike YA books where the growing up ends at age 16, Wolitzer begins there. We enter at this critical moment in time when life feels both fragile and endless. And, through Wolitzer's deft storytelling we realize it is both--and neither.I LOVED the relationships-the friendships, the romances, the family structures. Wolitzer pushes against our expectations and there were several moments where I held the book closer as if to say to a good friend: \"You can't be serious. That's what happened?\" In many ways, sitting down with this book felt as though I was sitting with a great friend. She made me laugh, think, question, wonder, shake my head in shock. Wolitzer bridges so much seemingly effortlessly--points of view, time periods, and the boundaries of family and friendship. Most of all, SHE TELLS THE TRUTH.That's what I felt most sharply: that she said things that nobody talks about--things I perhaps never dared to say aloud--even to myself--and she just places them on the page in her simple, funny-but-wise prose. And boy, she can write. Wow. Sometimes she used a phrase that I just had to reread a few times just for the pleasure of it. Truly, Wolitzer is a master storyteller. Everyone should read this book."}, {"userName": "Brigid", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8166278-brigid", "userReview": "A local bookstore featured this book on their suggested shelf and had written something to the extent of, \"What Franzen tries to do in Freedom, Wolitzer does in The Interestings.\" Based on this review, I snatched up the book immediately and looked forward to reading it at the beach over a long 4th of July weekend.And while this book was a mildly entertaining beach read, it stops there. There's not much at stake for any of Wolitzer's characters--all of whom are white, relatively privileged, and fail to change or develop over the course of nearly 500 pages. After 300 pages in, I was faced with the saddening truth that I had invested a lot in characters who were neither likeable, nor very interesting. The protagonist, Jules, especially comes off as whiney and self-pitying because she has a pretty ordinary--and by most standards, pretty blessed--life. Wolitzer is so insistant that Jules is \"funny,\" and \"easy to talk to,\" but she fails to create any scenes which show the reader as much. When the central drama revolves around what didn't happen for a particular character thirty years prior, things get pretty stale, and fast. While I managed to finish this one through, and at times I found myself enjoying certain aspects of Wolitzer's description of a changng NYC through the 70s and into the new millennia, on the whole, I found this book exceptionally uninteresting."}, {"userName": "Maxwell", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell", "userReview": "Absolutely wonderful.

The Interestings truly makes me swoon. I feel like the unseen member of this group of characters, the author has hypnotized me with her way with words. You simply must read this novel for yourself.This latest novel by Meg Wolitzer could easily become my reading yardstick. It is thought-provoking, serious, insouciant and amusing; it strolls across your consciousness with a lazy charm. Each character is lovingly crafted; Meg Wolitzer knows what she is doing and she does it well. There is perfect, persuasive prose, delicious, decadent detail and seamless, satisfying storytelling, relentlessly riveting the reader from go to whoa. Short stories want to grow up to be this novel, other fictions glare in uneasy jealousy and epics long to be edited down to this 468 page word perfect novel.

It's fascinating to me that so many people think this is an outstanding piece of writing. The author fails one of my most elementary assessments for my fifth-grade writers: Can you show me what you mean, instead of telling me? Not only are these characters not particularly interesting examples of adolescent self-obsession and shallowness (yes I know the title is ironic, but the failure of interesting-ness is way beyond ironic), but also the author tells us all the time that they have certain qualities, yet we don't really believe it, because we never see any of those qualities in action. For example, the character who is really at the center of the story is presented to us as exceptionally empathic, someone others love to be around and who reflects something warm and powerful back to them, but we never see it happen. Indeed, when we are privy to her ruminations, we mostly see her as filled with petty jealousies and shallow envy. She seems to attach herself to her \"best friend\" simply because she loves to be around rich people (coming from very limited means herself), but I don't think that was what the author intended. The whole story fails because I cannot imagine why any of these people even want to be with each other. Their group formed initially because they thought they were cooler than everyone else at their exceptionally cool camp, and we never see any better reason for them to be friends. I really don't get it. I do have a problem letting go of a book before I find out \"what happens,\" and it's hard to skip ahead on a kindle, so I did read it to the end, but I would not recommend it."}, {"userName": "Abby", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/379140-abby", "userReview": "Meg Wolitzer is a good writer and the first 100 pages vividly captures the angst-y itch of being adolescent and artistic, but as the plot progresses and the characters continue to act like their selfish and immature selves well into middle age, I ultimately lost interest in them. Wolitzer brings up many important topics (e.g., rape, 9/11, and AIDS, as well as themes of unrequited love, the role of money in friendships, morality and ethics between friends and couples, etc.) but everything is discussed briefly and superficially. It doesn't help that Wolitzer often uses the third-person omniscient voice so that you're not quite sure whether she is trying to make a generic or specific point, evoking a time in the present or future.In addition, some of the plot turns were so tangential and irrelevant that it almost seemed like Wolitzer was just working off of a list of social themes and major events for each decade (e.g., Reverend Moon and his religious cult for the 1980s, the World Wide Web for the 1990s, hedge funds in the millenium, etc.)"}, {"userName": "Richard Kramer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8281392-richard-kramer", "userReview": "This totally annoyed me, because it's fantastic and it's the book I wanted to write next if I was good enough to write it, which I'm probably not. It would be condescending and untrue to say of Meg Wolitzer that her work just keeps getting better, because it's always good. This one especially moved me, maybe because I saw myself in all its characters. And I like a longish book that pisses you off because it ends and now you've read it and what the fuck are you supposed to do now?"}, {"userName": "Lex", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2833068-lex", "userReview": "While the main character irked me at times with her jealousy and how unappreciative she was of her own life and talents, the author created her with the saving grace of self-awareness of these traits. The fact that she isn't blind to the absurdity of her envy of her friends was redeeming for me in a way.Liked:The author touched on a lot of meaningful themes that resonated with me. --Am I now who I thought I would become when I was young?--Is it significant that I may not be how I thought I would be?--How does the creativity or talent of youth translate into adult life?Much of Jules' life, she is consumed by nostalgia for the past, for one idyllic summer at a camp for creative kids that is her touchstone for the rest of her adolescence into her adulthood. This nostalgia stymies her growth as she clings to the ideal she had of herself and her life in the past, which inhibits her from fully inhabiting her life as an adult. In their youth, the group of friends all consider themselves talented artists in one way or another, but the way this translates into adulthood varies. Some of them do end up following the dreams of that summer-- Ethan the cartoonist and actress-turned-director Ash-- and others, including Jules, end up with very different lives. Jules remains bitter for much of the book that the creativity of her youth doesn't pan out into a lifelong career. I thought this was such a meaningful point; adolescents are so bombarded with images of adults in glamorous and artistic careers that I feel like it can almost feel like a failure when you find purpose doing something less special and less typically creative. So much of adolescence is really performance art, preening and presenting yourself in a way to appeal to others, that it seems like a more insular, less \"interesting\" career or life is a capitulation to growing up, aging, getting boring. But Jules' career (therapy) is so meaningful, and she is really good at it, and yet she feels like it isn't enough for her. Just because it's not something you necessarily dream about being at a young age doesn't mean it's not important, but Jules can't see that.I love the conversation between Jonah and Ethan towards the end of the book where Jonah, who was a talented musician in his childhood, tells Ethan the secret about why he didn't pursue a career in music.Ethan replies, \"I don't want to sound insensitive here, but you could still do some music anyway, right?\" \"What do you mean?\"\"Well, couldn't you just play?\"\"Just play?\"\"On your own, or with friends. You know, the way Dennis and his friends play football, and they're not in shape, right? But they enjoy it, and some of them are good, some of them worship the game. People do that all the time with music. They sit around playing whenever they get together. Does it have to be a job?\"I felt like applauding when I read that conversation because it put into words a feeling I get often, especially in the era of Facebook and Twitter and 24/7 humblebragging and oversharing... why not just do something because you love it, and not as a performance for others? And the fact that Jonah is so oblivious to that as even an option shows how foreign a concept that's become. Jules becomes obsessed with comparing her life to the lives of her childhood friends, and this is another theme I thought the author fleshed out really well. In a lot of ways, the characters of the books were really like mirrors held up to 30/40 somethings, where I found myself frustrated and annoyed with the characters who often seemed to have such obvious and exaggerated traits, but also, upon taking a step back, really seeing myself and some of my own neuroses and self-defeating behavior in them. Jules in particular retains such a singular selfishness, so typical of teenagers, that in the end is turned around on her by her sister.\"I'm sorry if I made you jealous.\"...\"Why would I have been jealous?\" Ellen said.\"Oh, because I always went on and on about my friends, and the camp, and the Wolf family and everything. I thought that was why you, you know, treated me kind of coldly.\"Ellen said, \"No, I treated you kind of coldly because I was kind of a bitch. I treated everyone that way, didn't you notice?... But it's just who I am; I can't really help it. No, don't worry, Jules, I was never jealous of you.\"The realization that her sister was wrapped up in her own selfish world, too, as a teenager seemed really significant, as did Jules' and Steve's failed summer camp takeover and the death of an important camp friend. By the end of the book, it really felt like Jules was ready to possibly move on with her life.Finally, I thought the author's explicit treatment of the role that privilege plays in life, especially in the life of someone wanting to strike out as an artist, was really refreshing. I'm so sick of reading about people born into situations where they automatically get a head start in life who are so blind to the opportunities presented to them. This book's main character, Jules, born into a very modest family, is hyper-aware of the differences between her life and the charmed lives of her friends at camp. It really made me think of the connections between privilege and career choices and marriage, especially in the context of the super-marriage of Ethan and Ash. Would either of them have succeeded as artists without the massive wealth of the other (at different times in the book)? Is that well-financed, easy art really demonstrative of creativity, or just of class and circumstance? I really wasn't expecting this book to be so thought-provoking but a lot of substance is beneath the surface of this book.

Things that claim and reclaim our thoughts more than we want them to, recollections that our etched into us no matter what we do. It can be a blissful moment, a painful time, a hopeful dream. But whatever causes us to look back to what was, to feel what we felt, to hear what we heard, to be what we were, is something that we long for, consciously or unconsciously. There is a thing lost that we want to recapture. This is Nostalgia. There is also this feeling during the present that makes you excited, makes you afraid about what can or will happen. A numbing sense that contains both anxiety and eagerness, a molten combination of good and bad with the little hint of freedom. A possibility that whatever happens, things will go on, things will move forward. You get the sense that the future is endlessly stretched out before you. You feel hopeful. This is the road that our life is, filled with keys to the past and doors to the future. Open one thing and it will set a sequence of events in place that will affect the past, present, and future. All you can do is look back, live, and hope. This is the breath-taking setting that Meg Wolitzer paints in The Interestings. She takes you forward, backward, through different times and different places. She makes you hope, she makes you remember. She starts off with youth, six promising teenagers on the cusp of greatness in an art summer camp. Three boys and three girls will lead very different lives, a collection of arrogant but talented teenagers who insipidly call themselves \u201cthe Interestings\u201d. With this Wolitzer displays the unpredictability of life and infinite possibilities of the future. She moves to the different times in their existence, from graduation, marriage, to childbirth, to challenges, to death, to nostalgia. She visits and revisits, she tells and retells. Meg Wolitzer captures the intricate movements of life in a way that both young and old can relate to.\u201c...You want to know whether the problems that you teenagers feel\u2014will they follow you over the rest of your lives? Will your hearts always be aching? Is that what you are asking me?\u201dGoodman shifted in discomfort. \u201cSomething like that,\u201d he said.\u201cYes,\u201d said the counselor in a suddenly plangent voice. \u201cAlways they will be aching. I wish I could tell you something else, but I wouldn\u2019t be telling the truth. My wise and gentle friends, this is the way it will be from now on.\u201dNo one could say anything. \u201cWe are so, so fucked,\u201d Jules finally said...\u201dThrough time, their roads drift apart and they traverse on, some with closer connections than others. But what they all have in common is a mesmerized fascination towards that summer in art camp, where they felt the endless promise of their future, ensured by talent, broadened by youth. Something put into focus here is the realization of talent. How certain advantages doesn\u2019t ensure success, how even the most gifted people don\u2019t get anywhere. This shows the fragility of a dream, how even the smallest things can diverge us from our path. That there are things that propel us; things unnoticed that leave giant impressions in our lives.\u201cTalent could go in so many directions, depending on the forces that were applied to it, and depending on the economics and disposition, and the most daunting and most determining force of all, luck.\u201d\u201cI always thought it was the saddest and most devastating ending. How you could have these enormous dreams that never get met. How without knowing it you could just make yourself smaller over time. I don't want that to happen to me.\u201dThe Interestings live their various lives dogged by their expectations. Wolitzer follows these characters from the height of youth through middle age, as their talents, fortunes, and degrees of satisfaction diverge.\u201cThough Jonah felt transfixed inside his own childhood, no one else saw him as a child. He was already over the hump of middle age, heading rapidly toward those years that no one like to speak of. The best parts had already passed for people Jonah's age. By now you were meant to have become what you would finally be, and to gracefully and unobtrusively stay in that state for the rest of your life.\u201dAs with everybody, they reach the apex of being and go downhill. Some fulfill their dreams, others don\u2019t, their lives ranging from great to good to bad to worse. But in the end, you realize that life is not about a dream. It\u2019s not about being what you wanted to be. Life is about dealing with what you have, learning to accept that things never go as planned, learning to improvise, to make the most out of things. Because really, you only have one life, you can\u2019t spend all of it dreaming. \u201cPeople could not get enough of what they had lost, even if they no longer wanted it.\u201d  \u201cAnd didn't it always go like that--body parts not lining up the way you wanted them to, all of it a little bit off, as if the world itself were an animated sequence of longing and envy and self-hatred and grandiosity and failure and success, a strange and endless cartoon loop that you couldn't stop watching..\u201dFocus on what you have, don\u2019t waste your entire life by longing for something that\u2019s not there. Because when you learn to appreciate what\u2019s in front of you, you\u2019ll understand that despite how ordinary things may seem, \u201c. .despite all you knew by now, it was still so interesting.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8106992-katie", "userReview": "4.5/5!
