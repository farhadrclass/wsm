This is pretty close to five stars and I might change my mind yet. Just a beautiful, lyrical and magical book, even though there is no literal magic or fantasy elements. karen pretty much nailed it when she said this was \"classic-feeling\". This whimsical historical tale has something timeless and wonderful about it - like all the best children's classics. The characters are so well-drawn and memorable, and the writing sparkles with a certain bittersweetness.It's about a spunky, intelligent girl called Sophie, who was found floating in a cello case in the English channel as a baby. The man who found her - Charles - decides immediately to do the only natural thing - raise and love this baby girl as if she was his own. People will easily fall in love with Charles. He is not a conventional parent and the child services certainly don't value his habit of letting a little girl wear trousers (god forbid!). He is quirky, weird and more concerned with raising a happy child, than one who fits into society's expectations. Also this:\n\u201cI do, I\u2019m afraid, understand books far more readily than I understand people. Books are so easy to get along with.\u201d\nThere's something about his attitude and the way he speaks that gives me a Dumbledore vibe.The setting moves between the rooftops of London and Paris as our charming pair of criminals run from the authorities who wish to take Sophie away. Behind this, though, is the search for Sophie's mother and all they have to lead the way is the cello and it's music.There is so much love for life, language and adventure in this book. It has you wishing you were the kind of person who could go racing around rooftops at midnight, seeing the whole of a beautiful European city laid out before you.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Pinterest"}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "just a wonderful, magical, extraordinary book. the kind of classic-feeling book you can put in the hands of a little girl and feel confident that with it, she will grow into a wonderful, magical, extraordinary creature herself. it might work on boys, too, who knows? but right now i am speaking to the fathers i know with young daughters who are looking for that book that will leave an impression on them in a literary role-model kind of way: a strong and smart and brave little girl raised by an eccentric man who may not have taught her much about how to be conventional, but who has shared a love of language and adventure, and has raised her to be fierce and loyal and courageous and independent.and on top of the glowing character(s), the language of the book is pure milky chocolate - just lovely and unexpected prose that really stands out when compared to any other book ever. this is a book i would have read until it fell apart if it had been around for me when i was, say, eight or so. this is a book you read when you are little and then take to college with you and then hand down to your own daughters. it is for sickbed reading, reading aloud, savoring and treasuring and pulling down from the shelves as needed. this book is begging to be inscribed and given as a gift.there is nothing i don't like about this book. and there is no way i can do it justice. an extended quote is the best i have for you.sophie is our young heroine, charles the man who took her in as a baby when she was found in the water after the capsizing of a boat, and miss eliot the social worker who disapproves of the whole situation. here:\tMiss Eliot did not approve of Charles, nor of Sophie. She disliked Charles's carelessness with money, and his lateness at dinner.\tShe disliked Sophie's watching, listening face. \"It's not natural, in a little girl!\" She hated their joint habit of writing each other notes on the wallpaper in the hall.\t\"It's not normal!\" she said, scribbling on her notepad. \"It's not healthy!\"\t\"On the contrary,\" said Charles. \"The more words in a house the better, Miss Eliot.\"\tMiss Eliot also disliked Charles's hands, which were inky, and his hat, which was coming adrift round the brim. She disapproved of Sophie's clothes.\tCharles was not good at shopping. He spent a day standing, bewildered, in the middle of Bond Street, and came back with a parcel of boys' shirts. Miss Eliot was livid.\t\"You cannot let her wear that,\" she said. \"People will think she is deranged.\"\tSophie looked down at herself. She fingered the material. It felt quite normal to her; still a little stiff from the shop, but otherwise fine. \"How can you tell it's not a girl's shirt?\" she asked.\t\"Boys' shirts button left over right. Blouses - please note, the word is blouses - button right over left. I am shocked that you don't know that.\"\tCharles put down the newspaper behind which he had retreated. \"You are shocked that she doesn't know about buttons? Buttons are rarely key players in international affairs.\"\t\"I beg your pardon?\"\t\"I meant, she knows the things which are important. Not all of them, of course; she is still a child. But many.\"\tMiss Eliot sniffed. \"You'll forgive me; I may be old-fashioned, but I think buttons do matter.\"\t\"Sophie,\" said Charles, \"knows all the capitals of all the countries of the world.\"\tSophie, standing in the doorway, whispered, \"Almost.\"\t\"She knows how to read, and how to draw. She knows the difference between a tortoise and a turtle. She knows one tree from another, and how to climb them. Only this morning she was telling me what is the collective noun for toads.\"\"A knot,\" said Sophie. \"It's a knot of toads.\"again - there is nothing i do not love about this book."}, {"userName": "Arah-Lynda", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859453-arah-lynda", "userReview": "Take a look at that cover. It is the stuff of dreams and so is this story.It was Charles that found Sophie.On the morning of its first birthday, a baby was found floating in a cello case in the middle of the English Channel.The baby was found wrapped for warmth in the musical score of a Beethoven symphony. It had drifted almost a mile from the ship, and was the last to be rescued. The man who lifted it into the rescue boat was a fellow passenger, and a scholar. It is a scholar\u2019s job to notice things. He noticed that it was a girl, with hair the color of lightning, and the smile of a shy person. Think of nighttime with a speaking voice. Or think how moonlight might talk, or think of ink, if ink had vocal chords. Give those things a narrow, aristocratic face with hooked eyebrows, and long arms and legs, and that is what the baby saw as she was lifted out of her cello case and up into safety. His name was Charles Maxim, and he determined, as he held her in his large hands - at arms length, as he would a leaky flowerpot - that he would keep her.Miss Eliot (from The National Childcare Agency) is also concerned about the baby\u2019s (whom Charles has named Sophie) care. Miss Eliot did not approve of Charles, nor of Sophie. She disliked Charles\u2019s carelessness with money, and his lateness at dinner. She disliked Sophie\u2019s watching, listening face. \u201cIt\u2019s not natural, in a little girl!\u201d She hated their joint habit of writing each other notes on the wallpaper in the hall. \u201cIt\u2019s not normal!\u201d She said, scribbling on her notepad. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy!\u201d\u201cOn the contrary\u201d said Charles. \u201cThe more words in a house the better, Miss Eliot.\u201d Among the many lessons Charles has given Sophie, he has taught her not to ignore life\u2019s possibilities.Sophie did remember her mother, in fact clear and sharp. She did not remember a father, but she remembered a swirl of hair, and two thin cloth-covered legs kicking to the beat of wonderful music, and that wouldn\u2019t have been possible if the legs had been covered in skirt. When they began to play the music was different. It was sweeter and wilder. Sophie sat up properly and shifted forward until only half an inch of her bottom was on the seat. It was so beautiful that it was difficult for her to breathe. If music can shine, Sophie thought, this music shone. It was like all the voices in all the choirs in the city rolled into a single melody. Her chest felt oddly swollen.This is such a beautiful story told in a very distinct voice. There are times when you just know you are reading a classic and this is one such time.This would be a beautiful gift for a mother to give to her young daughter, but it goes deeper and is so much more than that, unwritten, unspoken, unbroken bond. It is about the power of love, in all its many forms, all of them fierce and loyal. Embrace possibility and let Sophie\u2019s music take you to the rooftops of Paris. It is about hope and belief, about following your inner voice, listening to your senses and letting the music play on, play on, play on. All wrapped up in luscious, chocolaty prose. Here is a story that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. It is the stuff of dreams and it is delightful.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not scared of heights in any way, and the views\u2026 well, they\u2019d be pretty incredible, wouldn\u2019t they?But the more you think about, the less romantic it is. I mean, they\u2019re probably really dirty and well, if you fell you\u2019d pretty much be smushed and don\u2019t even get me started on the pigeons. I can only just deal with the pigeons when I\u2019m walking on solid ground but if I\u2019m balancing on a weathervane and a pigeon flies at me?I will freak the feck out. I said it would take quite a bit to make me want to scramble around on Parisian rooftops, but actually, all it\u2019s taken is reading Rooftoppers.I don\u2019t really have that much to say about this book because I just really enjoyed it and it\u2019s pretty much as simple as that. From the first line [ \u201cOn the morning of its first birthday, a baby was found floating in a cello case in the middle of the English Channel\u201d ] I was tangled up in this gorgeous, unique and extremely heart-warming story about a girl with hair the colour of lightning who is searching for her mum after being rescued from a sinking ship by an eccentric man named Charles*.I have to talk about the writing first because it was, without a doubt, my favourite part of the book. It was so delightfully odd without being weird for the sake of being weird. I could go on for a bit and tell you, using fancy words and gushing praise, how much I loved the writing but I\u2019m pretty knackered and my tea\u2019s gone cold so I\u2019m just going to give you examples.\u201cThink of night-time with a speaking voice. Or think how moonlight might talk, or think of ink, if ink had vocal chords.\u201d\u201cIt was the green that emeralds and dragons usually come in; which felt to Sophie like a good omen.\u201d\u201cThey did not taste remotely like strawberries, but they did taste like adventure.\u201dSee?I think it takes a certain kind of writer who can make the ordinary seem extraordinary with a few sentences and capture your imagination and encourage you, if only for a little while, to see the world in a slightly different way than you\u2019d normally do. And Ms Rundell\u2019s definitely that kind of writer.I think the language and the style of the book perfectly complimented Sophie\u2019s rather strange upbringing and the fantastic and slightly na\u00efve way she interprets what\u2019s happening around her. She was a gorgeous narrator and definitely one of my favourite middle grade heroines. Fearless, inquisitive and completely adorable; she truly was brilliant.And the setting? Let\u2019s just say I want to go to Paris again\u2026. now please. I adore Paris and it will always have a special place in my heart so it was so refreshing to read a story set there that wasn\u2019t immediately bogged down by all the clich\u00e9s that seem to latch themselves onto it. It was lovely to read about the city from a different perspective\u2026 one slightly higher than the others, shall we say?When I was reading it and I was whisked away to Ms Rundell\u2019s dreamlike Paris where the streets are still cobbled and the streetlights are being lit by hand, I couldn\u2019t help but think of the film The Illusionist. Except Rooftoppers had a much happier and incredibly delightful ending.So yeah, OK, I actually did have a lot to say about this book. But I really, really loved it and I really hope other people join Sophie for her adventure because it\u2019s truly magical. I absolutely can\u2019t wait to see where else Ms Rundell\u2019s stories takes me.[Pssst\u2026 it\u2019s dead cheap on Kindle at the moment!]*This isn\u2019t part of the review but !!!! oh Charles, let\u2019s go on adventures!

Rooftoppers was pure charming, quirky, and clever historical fiction. If that doesn't draw you in then maybe the mention of a stubborn and brave narrator who goes by the name of Sophie will, or the pages of lovely illustrations at the start of each chapter.It's true that this is a children's book, but I think readers of all ages will be able to enjoy it. The setting is in England and France and the descriptions of the cities are gorgeous\u2014French pastry shops, parks, bridges, and streets.Let me just talk about my love for the characters. Sophie and Charles were impossible not to grow fond of. When Sophie was a baby Charles found her floating on the English Channel in a cello case and took her in to raise her in his humble, book-filled apartment.Sophie was the most charming, adorable, and spirited twelve-year-old and Charles was her eccentric and loving guardian who had an extremely odd but wonderful way of taking care of her. He filled her mind with the knowledge of words since she was young, let her wear pants, and encouraged her to play her cello on the rooftops.\n\u201cSophie and Charles did not live neatly, but neatness, Sophie thought, was not necessary for happiness.\u201d\nThe plot follows the two as they flee the authorities to France to search for Sophie's lost mother. Sophie discovers a secret world on the roofs of Paris where dirty, poor, clever \"rooftopper\" children run free from the watchful eyes on the streets.This book was simply wonderful and dealt with themes of friendship, love, family, and music. I loved Rundell's smart but simple writing style that was unlike most books published nowadays. She had a way of stating truths so plainly and beautifully that I just adored.In Rooftoppers there were no fire-breathing dragons or prophecies, but a girl aching to find her mother and the adventures she made along the way. I loved it from the very first page until the last."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16839758-hannah", "userReview": "Rooftoppers started out brilliantly; the first chapters were full of whimsy and a sense of randomness that I completely fell in love with. The beginning of the story, which chronicles how our heroine, Sophie, is found as a baby floating in the ocean in a cello case and adopted by the kind-hearted scholar, Charles, was a pure delight. However, once the book became plot driven, with Sophie and Charles going on a journey to find her mother, it lost its magic for me.Also, Rooftoppers ended extremely abruptly. As I neared the final pages, I kept flipping ahead in confusion, thinking, \"the story can't end this soon, can it?\" But yes, Rooftoppers seemed to accelerate to a rollicking conclusion, and then come to an abrupt halt. Perhaps the pacing of the story was a conscious attempt by the author to mimic the theme of racing music. Cello music played double time is actually an important plot point in Rooftoppers. However, even if, interpreted in the most flattering light, the plot pacing was meant to replicate the musical theme, as a reader, I still found it to be unsatisfying.In the end, I felt that the beginning of Rooftoppers reminded me of the important things in life, the idea that love is much more important than acting \"proper\" or \"normal.\" But the rest of the book was not much more than a middle-grade, plot-driven, journey story.Despite this, Katherine Rundell is clearly a talented author with a unique voice. I hope that she shares her vision in future novels, and perhaps considers using her sense of whimsy in tales for older readers."}, {"userName": "Maja (The Nocturnal Library)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4551536-maja-the-nocturnal-library", "userReview": "Rooftoppers by Katherine Rundell has the quality and the warmth of a children\u2019s classic. It is a gorgeous story about a little girl in search for her mother. There aren\u2019t many stories like this, not anymore, and as a parent, I\u2019m extremely grateful when I discover one to share with my daughter. By far the best part of this book is Sophie\u2019s relationship with her foster father, Charles. Charles always encouraged Sophie\u2019s peculiarities and never tried to fit her into a mould. His only method of upbringing was to love Sophie as much as possible \u2013 everything else was to work itself out. Parents can learn a lot from Charles; oftentimes we try too hard and focus on all the wrong things, and in the process, we neglect what\u2019s most important. Sophie ate from book covers because she tended to break plates; she never brushed her hair, allowing it to become a tangled mess; she wore trousers sewn by Charles when girls were expected to wear pretty dresses, and she was homeschooled, mostly on Shakespeare. But she was the happiest child, free to become the person she was meant to. \n\"I know these sorts of people. They are not men. They are mustaches with idiots attached.\"\nRundell\u2019s writing is a thing of beauty, smooth and elegant, easy and utterly charming. She created a wonderful and magical story, full of love and unconventional beauty. It is almost impossible to describe why this book feels so much like a classic, but it does. Books like Rooftoppers are extremely rare and I\u2019m eager to share it with the people I love. \n\"Sophie,\" said Charles, \"knows all the capitals of all the countries of the world.\"Sophie, standing in the doorway, whispered, \"Almost.\"\"She knows how to read, and how to draw. She knows the difference between a tortoise and a turtle. She knows one tree from another, and how to climb them. Only this morning she was telling me what is the collective noun for toads.\"\"A knot,\" said Sophie. \"It's a knot of toads.\"\nNicola Barber handled the narration extremely well. Her characterization is excellent and her voice laced with humor in a way that can keep the attention of smaller kids. Sophie\u2019s naivet\u00e9 and sweetness were evident in her speech and she even pulled off a decent French accent when it was needed. Judging from my daughter\u2019s severe lack of patience, I can\u2019t see younger kids sitting through 6 hours of audio at home, but if you\u2019re planning a longer road trip with your children, I strongly recommend this book as an excellent way to make the time go faster. Both you and your children will gain a lot from it.This is a book children and adults both can read and reread several times. I know I would have, as a child, and I probably will now. I can\u2019t wait to share it with my daughter.

Caught between the upper end of childrens' and lower end of middle grade, I'm shelving the book as childrens, although readers of both age groups might find something to enjoy with Rooftoppers.

Click here to access the children's portion of the review.Grown-up portion of review:This is one of those kids' books that gets more stars for kids than it did for me. But this is the first time I've given it two extras on the library site.I think kids might appreciate the use of language, whereas I found some of it a bit kitschy. There were descriptions and even minor plot elements that chose quirky aesthetic sweetness over actual usefulness. A Chelsea bun that tastes like blue skies? It's a lovely sentence, but I'm no closer to knowing what that bun tastes like. And having a suit where a heart should be? It's been done - in fact, I'm pretty sure Meg Ryan says something very similar in You've Got Mail. But for young readers/writers just learning to wrangle words into a particular voice, this kind of language can be engaging and open up new possibilities.Another thing that makes the book enchanting for kids but a little dull for adults is the slightly stock nature of the characters. The hateful and conservative child welfare hounds; the crusty-but-kind, street-wise orphan boy; the loving, nontraditional, scholar dad. They create a magical world, even though I've read or watched all of them before.Finally, it's absolutely unbelievable. Yet another reason it bothered me but probably won't bother elementary readers.It's written for kids, so maybe I shouldn't even mention these grown-up off-putters; but the best of children's literature engages readers of all ages, and I think Rundell has it in her to write something that does so."}, {"userName": "Steph // bookplaits", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37929038-steph-bookplaits", "userReview": "In three words: charming, poetic, beautiful. \"Almost impossible means still possible.\" This was my first book of 2016, and it was an utterly enchanting read. Charming, witty and heart-warming, this is the story of a baby who survives a shipwreck and, found floating in a cello case, is taken in by a kind gentleman named Charles. While she loves him, the girl, Sophie, still believes that her mother is alive. Some years later, after discovering inside the cello case a clue that points to Paris, the pair travel there and Sophie begins to search for her long-lost mother, meeting 'rooftoppers' - children who live above the streets of Paris - along the way. Sophie is a delightful character - plucky, full of love, and determined. In fact, all of Rundell's characters are beautifully drawn, from the kind-hearted Charles to the wild and wonderful rooftopper children. Rundell's writing is gorgeous - it flows beautifully and the dialogue sounds completely natural. Overall, this was a lovely, fairy tale-like story and one that I fell in love with from the first page. Shoutout to my friend Marion for getting this for me as a Christmas present! :)Recommended for: everyone! Adults shouldn't miss out on this simply because it's a children's book.

I can't help but thinking about Heidi and Am\u00e9lie (yes, Audrey Totou). Even though the pace needs some time to pick up and the ending is too rushed for my liking, this book is so dreamy and easy to swallow. I like how the author picked a very unique perspective of the rooftoppers: eating pigeons and diving to collect wishing-coins to live.I don't know what else to say.

The one I've got is so beautiful... Anyway I guess I should start talking about the book? Well to start let me just say I have not read anything that has been so completely and shockingly beautiful that I am way past crying in about... well a long time. I think it may have been aimed at younger audiences but it mattered not. The story was so utterly simple but wonderful in this simplicity. You fell in love with all of the characters despite their imperfection. Katherine Rundell was able to portray a complete picture of characters with the merest of words. Every aspect of this story I loved. I would wonder when it was set but I really don't care for once. I don't care about the history or the facts, all I cared about was the way I cried at the very last page. Both because of the ending itself and the fat that the book was finished.

True, there were no other recorded female survivors from the shipwreck which left baby Sophie floating in the English Channel in a cello case, but Sophie remembers seeing her mother wave for help. Her guardian tells her it is almost impossible that her mother is still alive, but that means still possible. You should never ignore a possible. So when the Welfare Agency writes to her guardian threatening to send Sophie to an orphanage, she takes matters into her own hands and flees to Paris to look for her mother, starting with the only clue she has - the address of the cello maker. Evading the French authorities, she meets Matteo and his network of rooftoppers - urchins who live in the sky. Together they scour the city for Sophie's mother before she is caught and sent back to London, and most importantly before she loses hope.", "title": "Rooftoppers", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17350491-rooftoppers", "average": 4.02, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1362952099l/17350491.jpg", "reviews": 1173, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4511275.Katherine_Rundell", "name": "Katherine Rundell"}], "type": ["Childrens", "Historical", "Childrens", "Fiction", "Adventure"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17350491-rooftoppers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17334271-rooftoppers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17672318-rooftoppers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20759587-rooftoppers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34856927-sophie-en-los-cielos-de-par-s", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25070513-sophie-sui-tetti-di-parigi", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31352771-rooftoppers---para-penghuni-atap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25479269-rooftoppers---os-vagabundos-dos-telhados", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21378592-rooftoppers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28806578-g-ky-z-ocuklar", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23257157-the-wolf-wilder", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18615427-cartwheeling-in-thunderstorms", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34228372-the-explorer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36352249-one-christmas-wish", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40101112-la-ragazza-dei-lupi"]}
