{"ratings": 0, "userreviews": [], "description": "In this charming graphic memoir, the founder of the iconic housewares shop Fishs Eddy recounts the ups and downs\u2014and ups again\u2014of starting a family business, starting a family, and staying true to one\u2019s path while trying to make it in the Big City. Whether it\u2019s a set of vintage plates from a 1920s steamship, a mug with a New Yorker cartoon on it, a tin of sprinkles designed by Amy Sedaris, or a juice glass from a Jazz Age hotel, Fishs Eddy products are distinctly recognizable. A New York institution, Fishs Eddy also remains a family business whose owners endured the same challenges as many family businesses\u2014and lived to write about it in this tale filled with humorous characterizations of opinionated relatives, nosy neighbors, quirky employees, and above all the eccentric foibles of the founders themselves. Readers come to know author Julie Gaines and her husband, with whom she founded the store, and because this is a family business, the illustrations are all in the family, too: their son Ben Lenovitz\u2019s drawings bring Fishs Eddy to life with a witty style a la Roz Chast and Ben Katchor. \u00a0 Over the years the store has collaborated with artists and celebrities such as Charley Harper and Todd Oldham, Alan Cumming, and many others to produce original designs that are now found in thousands of stores throughout the country, and Fishs Eddy has garnered a huge amount of media coverage. A great gift for anyone who has ever dreamed of opening a little business\u2014or anyone with any kind of dream\u2014Minding the Store offers wisdom, inspiration, and an exceedingly entertaining story.", "title": "Minding the Store: A Big Story about a Small Business", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38746153-minding-the-store", "average": 0.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1523892746l/38746153.jpg", "reviews": 0, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17740569.Julie_Gaines", "name": "Julie Gaines"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17740570.Ben_Lenovitz", "name": "Ben Lenovitz"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17740569.Julie_Gaines", "name": "Julie Gaines"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17740570.Ben_Lenovitz", "name": "Ben Lenovitz"}], "type": ["Comics Manga", "Art and Photography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38746153-minding-the-store"]}
