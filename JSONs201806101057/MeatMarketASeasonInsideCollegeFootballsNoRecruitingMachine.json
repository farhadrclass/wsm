The author is an ESPN reporter who was 'planted' in the Ole Miss recruiting warroom for an entire year.The book is very uneven, it begins with a good bit of background into the recruiting process, and Orgeron's philosophy. It completely ignores many of the controversies around his stint at Ole Miss, including accusations that he tried to \"poach\" some of Tulane University's higher quality athletes in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The book does give a good flavor for Orgeron's blustery and fanatical focus on recruiting, to the extent that you get the feeling it came at the expense of on-field coaching and gameplanning, which was borne out in his results on the field and ultimate dismissal despite the highly ranked classes he brought in.My main problem with the book is the last few chapters - the author dramatically changes style and devolves into a very 'quick-hit' mode on actual results, almost like a news ticker, completely departing from the 'story within the story' approach in the first 3/4 of the book. In finishing the book, you couldn't help but think that the author was 3/4 done and then had a huge deadline put on him that forced him to rush the last 50 pages or so...Can only recommend to the hardest core college FB (and SEC) fans..."}, {"userName": "Michael Friess", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54261427-michael-friess", "userReview": "This was a quick, fun, and easy read I\u2019ve wanted to tackle for a few years.

This was a good book for me because me being an athlete I was able to learn and find out things that could help me as a high school athlete in the book that I didn't know before I read it. I was able to not exactly relate to this book, but more use it as a learning experience for my future recruiting process. I liked the book because it gave me real examples of the recruiting process situations that I could learn from which I thought was great for me being that I'm an athlete. A question I had after reading this book was, What is the chances of getting a scholarship from a Division 1 school for football? I had this question because the author shows us the process of football recruiting but not the actual chances of making it. The Meat Market: A Season Inside College Football\u2019s No.1 Recruiting Machine by Bruce Feldman is about a reporter named Bruce Feldman who goes deep into the aggressive college football recruiting process. He takes you deep inside the SEC war room of recruiting with legend Ed Orgeron, who helped build national championship teams at the University of Miami and at USC. In the year leading up to National Signing Day 2007, the award-winning journalist shadows Orgeron and his Ole Miss assistants as they set about hunting high school students inventing ways to lure them to their Oxford campus. Within this also we will here some outrageous off the field situations and crazy confessions this book will provide you with lots of knowledge about the college football recruiting process.I recommend this book to athletes of any sport in high school because you'll be able to relate to this book and it will provide you with lots of knowledge about the college recruiting process.

Specifically, it follows a Red Bull-fueled recruiting season with then Ole Miss head coach Ed Orgeron. The fact that an entire book can be written about a single team\u2019s recruiting tells you something about what college recruiting has become. Dave Cutcliffe was ignominiously ushered out of Oxford largely for recruiting failures. A few years later Ed Orgeron was ushered out for failures on the field. It appears that recruits are not enough (Houston Nutt was brought in to coach Orgeron\u2019s recruits; he had a couple seasons of success and was fired after four).There is nothing more groundbreaking or sordid here, other than an overreliance on Red Bull when coffee is so readily and cheaply available. If not properly salacious, something of the twists and turns of a recruiting is captured. Efforts are stymied by the administration\u2019s insistence recruits have demonstrated some limited academic aptitude. Elsewhere they are stymied by Mississippi State coaches keeping the Ole Miss coaches from so much as speaking with a recruit (with help from his friends and family).Groundbreaking? No. Entertaining? Yes. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to know more about college football recruiting, whether you\u2019re a novice or have a Scout premium pass, here is your opportunity."}, {"userName": "Jose Avila", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23449278-jose-avila", "userReview": "Any good book transcends its topic. In Bruce Feldman's \"Meat Market\" takes place in Ole Miss, a University in Mississippi. The book is about the football team there. The author mainly talks about what the coach did to get the team through the season. The coach which is also the main character, has one of the most unique personalities. What happens is that Ed Orgeron, the coach, sits in his office before dawn trying to get the best football players to go to Ole Miss. The coach has a very peculiar motto. His motto is ; \"Planes don't fly North\". He has this motto because of an event that occurred. This is a very good book, specially if you are a football fan. Also because this is a book that took place and occurred in a exiting place. That's why this book is such a good novel. I think that this book could possibly be made to a movie. If you're a fanatic of college football, this is a great book to read. I do recommend this book to read since it does seem good. If you are not into sports, then this book might be right for you and you might enjoy this book. That's all I can say about this book for now.

You'll hear about the details and realities of recruiting. From transferring, committing/decommitting, and the issues that face uneducated poor families in the south, Meat Market is an eye opener for the college football fan. Even though we may know the outcome of what happens to the focal point Coach O, Feldman hits recruiting and the importance of it on the head with this inside look at Ole Miss. This book is for really only the avid fan of college football who LOVES following recruiting as well. A person would could care less about National Signing Day, will find Meat Market too detailed. But for myself, I loved hearing about top prospects such as Jimmy Clausen, Golden Tate, and Joe McKnight. Feldman really details perfectly how much tireless effort is given to each recruit and the battle that schools go through (especially schools that have little tradition). Overall a solid read for any college football fan interested in recruiting and what it takes to build a program."}, {"userName": "Sean", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6606746-sean", "userReview": "I thought it a good idea to combine two of my biggest hobbies, college football and reading. The results, were disappointing. First off, this isn't a review of Ed Orgeron the coach or recruiter, just this book about those things. Author, Bruce Feldman, who've I've read articles from in the past, pens the \"inside\" look at recruiting in the SEC. Sadly, its inside only one program and the \"inside looks\" aren't much more than what can be gleaned from a recruiting website. There were a few \"heard it here first\" anecdotes but overall it was lacking any kind of newness. It was also terribly repetitive. There were a lot of individuals in the book but Feldman spent a ton of time reintroducing them that it became tedious to read. Also, it might have been better served to go more in-depth with the focus on Orgeron's tenure as opposed to one based solely on recruiting given than the lack of true insight. Overall, the book was boring and didn't feel like anything more an elongated magazine article."}, {"userName": "Inert1", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5962063-inert1", "userReview": "The material in the book was very good and informative. The author was given access to the recruiting activity of the Ole Miss football program, and shares some remarkable insights into major college football recruiting, as well as the state of high school education in the Deep South and elsewhere. The coach, Ed Orgeron, had a 3-year tenure at the school and is once again an assistant coach at USC. His ideas about recruiting, especially the level of activity and preparation are relevant to just about any field of endeavor, and I think that one can learn from his ideas. From a literary perspective, I think that the book underachieves quite seriously. It is generally in the form of a daily log, and it is a bit of a challenge to keep the players and coaches straight in one's mind. I think that the author would have been better served to track the recruiting process of each individual from the start to finish, or at least near completion.

The book's main plot is about Ed Orgeron's recruiting process, in which he would know a lot about recruiting because he is now the head football coach at Ole Miss and before was an assistant coach for Pete Carroll where he recruited a lot of big time players. But, the books not just about the Ole Miss recruiting process though, it as about all the work that every college football team's staff member must do to recruit kids. I would really encourage anybody to read this book that wants to know more about college football recruiting or also anyone that wants to play college football because it tells you everything you need to know about it. I would also recommend this book to anybody that loves sports books because this is the type of book then once you read the first 25 pages you don't want to set it down because there is so much information being presented to you."}, {"userName": "Kyle Pennekamp", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2655221-kyle-pennekamp", "userReview": "A very quick read. If you love college football, this is a great 2 or 3-day pick-up. It follows the recruiting of the 2007 Ole Miss class by Ed Orgeron and his coaching staff. The main sell of the book is Orgeron's huge, brash, hysterically funny personality. Most of the first half of the book concentrate's on that, and really outshines the latter half of the book, which is mostly a recitation of recruits and their decisions. It drives home just how hard it is to turn a program around, especially when that program is competing with nearby national powerhouses. It's also fun to read about guys you now know as stars in NFL who were only lightly recruited over the course of the book, and to see busts of big-time, cocky recruits.Also great was the fact that my softball first baseman's little bother, Stephen Garcia, is one of the main characters in the book."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2069667-tom", "userReview": "Though it does not cover college football recruiting in general as I expected it to (follows the recruiting of Ole Miss under former Coach, Ed Orgeron), it is still interesting as a college football fan to see how much goes into just recruiting. Though most of us fans already know they put so much work into it, just reading up on how a program that is not a bottom feeder, but not elite, tries to get top named recruits, while in the balance making sure they at least get enough guys they know they can get to commit, is great. I am not an Ole Miss fan, but while reading the book I wanted to root for their coaching staff to land in the big recruits (I knew already they did not get certain ones, but hey, its like watching a movie where you know the ending and you still wish it might end differently)."}, {"userName": "Carianne Carleo-Evangelist", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49925814-carianne-carleo-evangelist", "userReview": "Despite not being the world's biggest Ed Orgeron fan (he's a bit too much Ryan brothers in my opinion) I really liked this inside look at his Ole Miss tenure.

While the death of TOny Fein was of course heartbreaking a few years ago, there have been some nice stories to come out of the kids he recruited including Peria Jerry, Michael Oher & Mike Wallace.

In particular, it centers on the Ole Miss College Football Team under Ed Orgeron. Orgeron is regarded as one of the best recruiters in the game, and the book gives insight into how he did recruiting at Ole Miss and in the brutal SEC. However, the interesting figure is Orgeron himself. A big Cajun man, he has quite a wild and driven side. He was such a character during his stint as defensive line coach at Miami in the early to mid 1990s, that one of his players, Dwyane \"The Rock\" Johnson based many of the mannerisms of his wrestling persona on him. The business is rough and it is a wonder that any actual coaching gets done with all the recruiting responsibilities (given that Orgeron only lasted 3 seasons, it is not hard to see).
