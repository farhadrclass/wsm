And a certain character really surprised me. I especially liked all the sexy times with Tomo.The middle felt like it was dragging on a bit which is why I took off a star. But other than that (and a few other minor things), looooved this book.Need the next book NOW."}, {"userName": "Jane ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29686329-jane", "userReview": "Bet that caught your attention.So I just want you guys to know that when I wrote this review, I was in a deep, dark place. I'm probably not coherent through out the review, or literate, but bear(Or is it bare?) with me.If you worship this series, please leave now before you have a heart attack from my OPINIONS.Ok? Ready? A SPOILER TRAIN UP AHEAD.So I was walking around my library the other day and I saw this gorgeous book, just sitting silently on it's own. Neglected by other books and all by itself in it's own little cubby hole. That book was Rain.First of all, I've read the first book, Ink, and even though I was very impressed by the concept, the writing and plot threw me off. Ugh. A wonderful concept, flawed by the writer.So I left it there. Three days later, as I turned the corner , there the book was. Watching me. Beckoning me closer. Waiting for me to fall into the pit of yet another, beautiful cover and shit plot.And fall into a pit of shit I did. And everyday that I was holed up in there, covered with literary piles of poop, I held onto the dying hope that maybe, just maybe, something will go right.Not much did.The Low Down:Katie Greene, your average white, beautiful, dumbass Mary SueThat's kind of, sort of Japanese?Who has two guys begging to send their 'friend' into her secret garden(No sersly. The love interest nearly raped the idiot in the first novel) is sent to her aunt in Japan, because her parents are dead and her grandparents are 'not well'.There, she meets the 'bad boy', Tomohiro. Now let me say something about Tomo. Despite the fact that his name always brings a giggle to my lips and reminds me of this:What annoys me about him is his mood swings. Like one moment he's like:Then five minutes later he's all:\u201cSuki\u201dPersonally, I think their romance escalated like this:By the way, it's complete and utter bullshit, for all of you reading this with starry eyes and hands over your racing hearts hearts.You girls probably won't find a copper haired, Asian, smokin' hot,earring bearing, mysterious and supernatural boy. Ever. It's not like you run into any guys like that every time you turn a corner at school. They don't grow on trees, ok? And nor do they breed like rabbits. You have a better chance of finding this thing:So then we meet this guy:AKA, Jun.(High fives for all the people that gets this and have seen the show) The third wheel. Obviously.And finally, Shiori.Oh the poor girl. Shirori is a pregnant Japanese girl who only had Toms to depend on when times were tough for her. Then, our Mary Sue bitch swoops in and takes him away from her. Shame on all of y'all that hate on Shiori. The poor girl's best friend was just taken way from her! If that happened to me I know I wouldn't be all calm and threatening like Shiori, I would use all my years of watching Karate Kid to good use and snap some Mary Sue neck.Sun tried very hard to paint Shiori as the 'antagonist' and Katie was the 'angelic and empathetic white girl' so much so that I realized what she was doing.With quotes like these, it's hard not to notice it:\u201cShiori[...]it's fine, you can stay with us\u201d(20)\u201cYou can come with us[...]More fun that way\u201d(72)Sun also tried to make Toms the classic, loyal bad boy that's always dedicated to his woman, but what it came out like was he was a disrespectful, rude batch that had all the symptoms of being on his man period. Everyone else was only there for one reason and one reason only, to be plot devises. Her teacher was in there to show how much she was struggling in school, Diane was in there to tell Katie about her sad and tragic past and Toms' dad was there to slap him.Good going Toms' Dad.I'm going to move on from the poor baddie building skills Sun has and move on to some more pressing issues. The story line.Yeah, it was that terrifying to read.Oh my god. The fucking story line. It made me shed tears of blood. It made me wonder how people get published these days. It made me want to phone my mother and tell her I love her just in case I die from all this stupidness.Let me give you a break down of why I feel like it was complete and utter bullshit.-Toms' turmoil as he struggles to keep his power under check.Even though I feel like this is the only part that's keeping this plot moving,I see some bad decisions being made. If he knows he is going crazy, why is he still participating in Kendo?! That's like, giving a serial killer a gun!Why?-The quickfix for why Katie is who she is. Which is because her stupid ass mother ate some Kami sketched dragon fruit brought all the way from Japan. How does she know this? Diane, somehow remembers, even though it's been over fifteen years, that the type she ate was darker than the rest.Oh lord. The fuckery. The absolute mindless fuckery. DOES DRAGON FRUIT HAVE BREEDS OR SOMETHING? ARE THERE TOY SIZED ONES? ARE THERE CURLY HAIRED ONES? MAYBE THERE ARE ONES CALLED LAGONOODLES? NO THERE AREN'T! THERE ARE ONLY PINK ONES! So why the fuck would you eat one that's goddamn 'dark purple'?(118)-The plot circles. So, basically eighty percent in, Toms gets all, STAY AWAY FROM MEH! I'M DANGEROUS! And Katie's all, I don't give a fuck, I want to hump you more and Toms all, GOMEN. Hmmm, sound familiar? BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE! WE WENT THROUGH THIS SHIT IN INK(And New Moon, btw). They even admitted it themselves.\u201c[...] it means we're right back where we started\u201d(224)-The god awful love triangle. This is the fall of young adult fiction I tell you. The worst part? It so forced, that my reaction to Jun and Katie's kiss is like:Well, that's basically my reaction anytime Katie kisses anything.But what irked me isn't how random the make out sessions are. It's how the love triangle could have been completely avoided. When Jun kisses Katie, she should've been:But no, she takes her time sniffing him, realizing he smells really yummy, then feeling guilty about it. The worst part? It even wasn't her who broke the kiss off. But it gets better. We mustn\u2019t forget Shiori, Ikeda, or that other guy! With those people added, it could be a love pentagon party! And we're all invited to see how this train wreck can fall of the side of the Mount Stupid it had crashed upon! -The 'tension'. So Shiori then captures them on camera and is ready to give it to Toms. If I was Shiori, I would've done the exact same thing, I don't care if they had already split up. It's been less than three days and she's already got her tongue down some other motherfucker's throat.You'd think Toms' reaction after he sees the photo would've been like this:But nerrrrrrr. Toms finds out and is all 'If she's happy...Imma be happy also.'To which Katie replies with:'Oh, what a load of crap.'(259)Couldn't have said it better myself. Then there's this 'epic' fight scene between Toms and Jun... And then Katie comes up with this piece of work when Jun calls out for her instead of Ikeda, his BFFAEAEAE:'What am I suppose to do? Jun didn't feel the same way she felt'(289)Bitch, you might as well be saying:UGHHHHH!Then the wuv birds make up.I'm going to go now."}, {"userName": "Nasty Lady MJ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4026143-nasty-lady-mj", "userReview": "To see full review click hereI give too many second chances.If you read my review of Ink you\u2019ll know that I wasn\u2019t overly impressed by this series. But I decided to give it a second chance for two reasons:1)Japan: Let\u2019s face it. If a book is halfway readable and if it takes place in Japan I\u2019m going to read it.2) Non-Western Mythology: Again. If it\u2019s halfway readable, I\u2019m going to read it.However, those two things alone aren\u2019t enough to make a good book. As Ink and Rain is proof of.I really was hoping for more.There was lots of potential with the Paper Gods series even if Ink was basically Twilight set in Japan.And I will say that there was some (being the optimal word) improvement with Rain. Not enough to make it a better book than Ink, but enough where I wouldn\u2019t say this was a complete bomb.What did Rain have to offer that Ink didn\u2019t have:1) Consequences: There are actually some consequences to Katie, Tomo, and Jun\u2019s stupidity. Some. And there\u2019s also consequences for Katie being completely illiterate in Japanese school. That was something right?Well, almost. Of course, these consequences would ultimately be jacked up. But hey\u2026.it was an attempt at consequences.2) The plot deviates a bit more from romance: A little bit, mind you. We still have to deal with some stupid YA love melodrama which I\u2019ll get to in a minute. But Sun did try to flesh out the romance aspect a bit more.3)The characters are a little bit more developed: Well, sort of. At least I know more about Tomo and Jun besides their different hair colors.Now for the bad:You know I feel bad about this.People were asking me why I was giving this book a chance since I didn\u2019t like its predecessor that much. But I told them I saw the potential.And now I\u2019m kicking myself.While I tried to write down the improvements I saw with Rain, it really was hard for me to say it was that much of improvement.In a lot of ways, Rain was a reminiscent to New Moon as Ink was to Twilight.I\u2019m not joking in this book we had:1) Relationship Trouble2)Break Ups3) Love Triangles4) And Mopey Main Characters.Yeah, sounds like New Moon to me too."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14604386-hannah", "userReview": "***EDIT #1***I TOLD YOU IT WOULD BE GORGEOUS...

Check it out for more reviews! A wonderful Japanese setting coupled with a rich exploration of Japanese mythology about Kami, Rain was an excellent sequel of Ink. I love how the Paper Gods series brings the rich and vibrant Japanese culture to life. It interchanges the language into the dialogue which is never difficult to pick up, talks about wearing traditional yukata, having bento boxes for lunch and living in traditional guest rooms with tatami mats. Japan is one of my favourite places, and the culture and traditions felt authentic.Rain focuses more centrally on the Kami mythology, with Katie and Tomohiro struggling to understand the effects of the ink which seems to be spiraling out of control. Tomo\u2019s loose grip on his powers bring about some pretty epic scenes, where a whole festival explodes in a rain of ink and he keeps on succumbing to the dark side during kendo. The two have a tumultuous relationship, as they try and work through their issues with his powers which only seem to get worse with Katie around. I was swept up in the beautiful mythology and the paintings sprinkled throughout the paperback, as Katie explores the origins of the Kami and her own past.Compared to the first book, Katie was a lot less annoying and more mature, as she is focused on helping Tomohiro overcome his dangerous Ink powers as a Kami, and finding out about her own powers. I liked how she shared her struggles of being a foreigner in Japan, such as the difficulty of picking up the language, learning kanji, and of needing to \u2018read between the lines\u2019 when it came to emotions. These cultural differences could only be pinpointed by someone who had experienced the culture first hand, and the author having been in Katie\u2019s situation captured it in a candid way. She still continues her stalker tendencies though by turning up to Jun\u2019s school now on then to find out more about the Kami.The romance leaves a lot to be desired, as it succumbs to cliche elements throughout the novel. There\u2019s a love triangle with Jun, the bad boy and enemy to her boyfriend which she sneaks around with and keeps a secret, and the interfering jealous girl. Katie and Tomo also decide they need to stay away from each other so their powers don\u2019t hurt each other, even though their feelings are strong. Both Jun and Tomo have their own complex stories, which made them interesting love interests. I couldn\u2019t see or feel why they would be attracted to Katie though, and the novel doesn\u2019t really show us this.I enjoyed the friendship angle here with Katie building authentic relationships with her friends Tanaka and Yuki, who helped her with her study struggles and stood by her.Rain was an improvement over Ink as it explored the mythological aspects of Kami and had some pretty epic scenes with drawings coming to life. While the relationship aspect of the book felt contrived, this series captures the beauty and the authenticity of living in Japan, which I really enjoyed. A great cultural YA novel covering the beautiful culture of Japan, coupled with rich, beautiful Japanese mythology.I received a review copy from Harlequin Australia in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Veiledhorizon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46927750-veiledhorizon", "userReview": "I found this book to be better than the first book and kind of the same as the last book.(i read the last book first by accident- that doesnt affect the rating though) The relationship between Katie and Tomo was better than in the first book. However, i didnt like it that Jun got involved in their relationship. I found him annoying for getting involved. I like that we get to know more about the Kami world though it's not that developed so the 3 stars. Well, i also didnt like Shiori and Ikeda being rude and nasty towards Katie. They annoyed me so much. Yuki was a really good friend though. Also, i like the fact that the parents or guardians are present in these books. It's great that they play a part in the protagonist s' lives. I really love the sketches that are added to the book. Anyway, this series in overall is okay. It does have issues but I just love the atmosphere of Japan that is being described and the idea of weaving in the Kami into the story."}, {"userName": "Paige (Illegal in 3 Countries)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27556706-paige-illegal-in-3-countries", "userReview": "See more of my reviews on The YA Kitten!2.5 stars.Close to four years have passed since the Great Computer Crashes stopped me from reading manga online, but my desire for the feel of it has never gone away. Ink, with its setting and art and its love of shoujo manga tropes, was exactly what I wanted and needed when I read it in early 2013. So was Rain anticipated? OH YEAH. Too bad the appeal wasn\u2019t as strong this time around thanks to poor female representation and enough angst to kill several fictional characters.If Ink was a possibly unintentional homage to the tropes that shoujo manga thrives on, Rain is 100% shoujo without the pictures. You still have your bad boy love interest, the \u201cgood\u201d other guy in the equation who has an edge so sharp you could shave with it, and the headstrong girl who gets caught up in their mess. This time around, Jun is a lot more present and thus there\u2019s more romantic tension between Tomo and Katie. More than that, we get more angst about how they can\u2019t be together because the ink in her reacts to him. It\u2019s all sweet and entertaining and makes me yearn for all the shoujo manga I\u2019ve ever read\u2013even the ones that were questionable in their quality.At the same time, the overdose on cliches from both manga and YA is a little much. I\u2019m fairly certain any and all drinking games I could find would result in death from alcohol poisoning if applied to Rain. Sure, this was the case in the first book too, but Rain was far less appealing because we got enough of Tomo\u2019s angst in the first book. Now we have Katie being the one to whine about how they can\u2019t be together and how she needs to drive him away from her? Good grief! One thing I\u2019m not here for no matter what I\u2019m reading is intense angst. Sure, her angst is what gets her to go see Jun so much and results in this OT3-launching line, but still.\u201cYuu and I would make good princes,\u201d Jun said after a minute. \u201cAnd you would rule with us, Katie.\u201d (p. 209)You try to tell me one can\u2019t squeeze the implication of polyamory out of that and I\u2019ll tell you to get out because you don\u2019t know what polyamory is.ANYWAY. As fun as that accidental ship-launcher is, things that aren\u2019t fun about this novel include its poor portrayal of female characters not named Katie Greene. Her friend Yuki is kind enough, but she isn\u2019t that present. Ikeda, a friend of Jun\u2019s and a fellow Kami, and Tomo\u2019s pregnant childhood friend Shiori are antagonistic with Katie because of how close she is to both men. The subplot of Shiori trying to win Tomo over and take him from Katie is ridiculous and probably the least necessary element of the book. There\u2019s enough drama without her, so why exactly is it necessary? Ikeda has a little more wiggle room and is even kind to Katie at one point, but Shiori gets nothing. STOP THE GIRL HATE 2015.Oh, and there\u2019s a character who is implied to be queer and the novel never confirms it. Pleeeeeease make him openly gay for the third book and give him a sexy boyfriend to love? His character is rough around the edges, but a romantic subplot for him would be the best because gay Japanese boys falling in love awwwwww. (Before you ask, I\u2019ve never read yaoi and never will. It\u2019s not my thing, but I\u2019m all about representation of queer relationships and characters in fiction even if their stories aren\u2019t necessarily to my taste for whatever reason.)Despite my great deal of irritation at the girl hate and overindulgence in tropes, Rain was entertaining enough for a weekend at my grandmother\u2019s and I\u2019m still planning to stick around for the finale to the Paper Gods series. Here\u2019s hoping it\u2019s a stronger novel than both Ink and Rain ever were and continues the tradition of gorgeous art. Fact: I do, in fact, bump up my ratings for these books a bit thanks to their gorgeous artwork. BUT ANYWAY. Not the best novel unless the reader was 100% in love with book one, in which case they\u2019ll be happy with this too. Those who were lukewarm about book one won\u2019t want to give book two a shot."}, {"userName": "Catriona (LittleBookOwl)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5365999-catriona-littlebookowl", "userReview": "I received this book for free from the publisher through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.THE SHORTRain was a wonderful sequel which continued to keep the beauty and rich Japanese culture, mythology and setting alive. The characters continued to develop and surprise, leaving you conflicted about who you thought you could trust. This book had a nice, calm pace with some intense moments leading up to the conclusion - though the section around the middle did drag slightly. I think this was a great sequel which some surprises towards the end which will definitely lead to an intense third book!THE LONGThe main thing which I love about this series is how strong and present the Japanese elements are in this book. Although I have not read many books set in countries outside of the U.S.A. or England (excluding fantasy worlds), for the ones I do come across, I find that the setting and cultural differences are somewhat lacking. Amanda Sun certainly has no problems here and highlights the beauty of Japan so wonderfully. Furthermore, Katie's struggles with adjusting to the culture and abiding by the expected social behaviours were very realistic.That being said, some of her other mistakes and decisions began to get a bit irritating. She isn't as forthcoming with Tomo about some of the things she did as she probably should have been. This kind of correlates to the love triangle that isn't really a love triangle... things never progress far enough, but outside sources kind of make it into some form of a pentagon... but not quite. It's a weird situation.There was so much mystery surrounding some of the characters - you could never really pinpoint whether they were helping Katie or working against here. There were plenty of surprises along the way, and my opinions of a few of the characters have drastically changed! I'm really intrigued to see how the characters continue to progress, and I can't wait to see what happens in the next book!"}, {"userName": "Molly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/913689-molly", "userReview": "This book was MUCH better than the first one. There were still a lot of things that made me roll my eyes (see all of my status updates) but THANK YOU FOR NOT USING GAIJIN!!!! Finally. It was only used 2-3 times in this book and it was used in the proper way. Finally. The whole name thing bothered me because it's really not a thing for foreigners. In my seven years in Japan I have never had any issues with names. Also, Ishikawa getting shot and then it being basically no big deal outside of the small group involved in the book is just unrealistic. Guns are illegal in Japan and if a random high school kid ended up in the hospital from a gun shot that would be HUGE. The lack of media frenzy around that was just weird. The lack of ANY frenzy was weird. I mean, earlier this month here in Japan a stupid pop star got attacked with a saw and that's ALL anyone could talk about for WEEKS. I once heard a news story about a weirdo shooting girls with mayonnaise. A gunshot wound would big A BIG DEAL. Katie was much better in this. Still can't believe that she lost her mom a year ago and is just so okay with it. She was less stupid and less stalker-ish, but there were a few times when I just wanted to tell her to SHUT UP OMG. Shiori was super annoying but made some good points that highlighted some issues that I think are important to talk about. Jun was too melodramatic and his drama was so annoying. I feel bad for Ikeda and loved Tomo (dream sigh) as always.Overall I felt like this was a lot more story and a lot less of Sun trying to prove that she has some authority over teaching us Japanese culture. The first book felt like LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF I KNOW ABOUT JAPAN and this one had a LOT less of that. Annnnnd finally, as with the first book, I don't believe Katie's Japanese ability AT ALL. There is no way that she's as fluent (speaking wise) as she is. There's no way she's running around able to understand everyone, saying everything correctly, no problem, and then turning around and having so much trouble with reading and writing and then turning around and whipping out text messages and reading others no problem. Also, they're all supposed to be speaking Japanese, but again there's a bunch of Japanese words written in romanji thrown in and it just makes no sense. A lot of the words were also defined and explained in text this time (despite having a functioning glossary in this eArc, unlike the first one). I really wish that all of those random romanji were left out. It MIGHT make it a bit more believable (or at least make me think less about what language they're speaking) that they're speaking Japanese all of the time. ANYWAY. If you liked the first book, then you'll like this. And sorry not sorry for being so nit-picky, but I feel that if we're going to go the whole #weneeddiversebooks route then the books with all the diversity in them should at least be accurate."}, {"userName": "Alexandra Janis Gonzalez", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23974892-alexandra-janis-gonzalez", "userReview": "I can't wait to know what's going to happened next!"}, {"userName": "Katrina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3736501-katrina", "userReview": "I enjoyed this one a lot better the the first.

And I just finished reading it a few hours ago.Have you ever had a book that made a huge impact on you and you can's stop thinking about it? Rain was one of these books. The characters themselves, the culture, the story, the setting. Everything begs to be re-lived again. And it was so hard to move on from Rain.Maybe it was the characters, the romance between Tomo and Katie. I couldn't help but shiver most of the time when Tomo and Katie were together. And there was just that one time when I felt my heart break into two when they were almost torn from each other. Katie is one of the best heroines out there, living out of her comfort zone, and not backing down even when she's scared. She has a fighting spirit. And that's what kept her alive throughout the book. Not only does she have Tomo and his powers to worry about, she has to worry about being sent to international school as her vocabulary didn't meet expectations. But still, she worked hard and did everything she could to solve the problems.Rain had the best character development, especially for Jun and Shiori. In this book, you see Jun's true colours when he loses control of his powers and reveals who he truly is. Shiori showed a huge change of character. We get to know her more in Rain as she starts making more appearances in the book. There's more to her soft and delicate appearance than she lets on.Maybe it was the rich culture that pulled me in. I love Japan. I've been there twice and I loved it there. Japan is everything from fun to amazing to heaven. Reading Ink right before jumping into Rain only immersed me deeper into Japan's rich tradition and mythology. This book may even be one of the factors that make me love Japan even more. Besides, you get to learn Japanese while reading Rain. Kendo also makes my heart pound and blood heat because even when it doesn't seem like it, it plays a huge part in this book.Maybe it was the story itself. It was made of so many layers. The top layer covered many more layers underneath, mostly secrets. Secrets about Jun's past and his true identity. Secrets about Tomo's loss of control over his powers. Secrets about Katie's ink. And you wouldn't want to miss a single thing about them.But overall, I loved Rain as much as I loved Ink. It's definitely a great read if you want to read books in a different setting and culture. We read diverse books, right? If you missed my review on Ink, go here: http://girlinthewoodsreviews.blogspot...For our interview with the author, go here: http://girlinthewoodsreviews.blogspot...Brief Review: Amanda Sun, you are an amazing writer and storyteller. You have left a huge impact on me with your words and I can't begin to express my love for you for writing Rain. I can't tell you how often I think of Japan now after reading your book. Well-developed characters, complex storyline, a beautiful country with a rich culture is what makes this book as good as it was. I couldn't have asked for a better sequel to such an awesome book.

GOD(S). THIS BOOK. THIS BOOK. I CANNOT ACCURATELY DESCRIBE MY FEELINGS.I love this book so much i wanna eat it and let it settle in my stomach and then do some weird book dance or something idk i just gahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ^that was really weird. but anyways. onto what i liked about the book: (SPOILERS FOR INK BELOW, BUT NOT FOR RAIN)-I had thought the ending of INK was a bit anticlimactic, but oooohhhh boy am i glad she stayed.-TOMO TOMO TOMO TOMO TOMOHIRO COME HERE YOU-^ i swear i'm not that shallow. Tomo undergoes a lot of growth in this novel and we get to see him depending on Katie and realizing that he isn't alone. And that is just a phenomenal shift.-Katie has to figure out her priorities and must struggle through lies and facades to protect herself and those she love, and that means she gets in some pretty deep trouble with some people you reeeallly don't wanna mess with.-What Tomo says to Shiori about the thing. When you get there. Ahhhh yes. I was just like OH TOMO YOU GO TOMO YOU TELL HER. YES TOMO -We find out some INSANE history and hypotheses in this book and it is FABULOUS. I cannot overstate how happy I am about Japanese (and accurately described.... *cough* \"City of a thousand dolls\" and my billion hatred seeds for it) culture and mythology being so thoroughly described in a YA book where the market is saturated by white gurlz. Nothing wrong with Caucasians, just.... DIVERSITY MAN. Now we just need someone to do that for the Chinese... like I know there are some out there but most of them take place in the US... hmm... I should get on that.Annnnd I could go on and on. But the thing is, I loved how I could smell the cherry blossoms and hear the furin and see the ink flow and feel the earth rumble and live with the characters as they despair and evolve and realize that they aren't alone.I love it.

And I know a lot of people who were just as disappointed in it as I was. And while I swore off the sequel at the time, part of me always knew I\u2019d come back for the sequel. Because the sequel could be better, and that\u2019s what I was banking on.And for one brief second, just the briefest, I thought this book was going to shine. Katie was a little more likable, Tomohiro wasn\u2019t such a douche, and Jun was poised to be the villain turned hero who ends up saving them all. That last part is my favorite thing ever to read. I love villains who become heroes, reluctantly or not. This is probably why Warner from the Shatter Me series, is my favorite baddie gone good I love those badboys doing good things.But this book falls apart about a hundred pages in. At around a hundred pages petty teenage bullshit starts to creep in, and this book becomes more about a love triangle and secrets, than anything else. The backstory seems randomly tossed in, as if the author felt obligated, and it\u2019s endless page after a page of jealousy and the teenage maturity levels and really shitty character growth. And no fucking redemption for Jun. The greatly angers me. Is it so much to ask for, that as a reader, I get a decent Japanese mythology book? This year has already proven I can\u2019t get a decent Korean mythology book. Maybe asking for decent is just asking too much. I\u2019m not sure. But Rain is worse than Ink because Ink was pretty bad the whole way through. Rain shows decent potential long enough to trick its reader into becoming invested.

If you haven\u2019t read Ink, the first novel, there will be some spoilers below, though nothing too major. I can\u2019t help but adore the magic system based on ink drawings and the view of Japan from an outsider\u2019s perspective as Katie tries quite hard to learn how to fit in. Though I\u2019m not very familiar with Japan\u2019s culture and language, I thought that Rain successfully conveyed various cultural differences from the US and integrated Japanese phrases without leaving an American reader in the dust.Note: I received Rain through Netgalley for an honest review.

She's started to build a life in the city of Shizuoka, and she can't imagine leaving behind her friends, her aunt and especially Tomohiro, the guy she's fallen in love with. But her return is not as simple as she thought. She's flunking out of Japanese school and committing cultural faux pas wherever she goes. Tomohiro is also struggling\u2014as a Kami, his connection to the ancient gods of Japan and his power to bring drawings to life have begun to spiral out of control.When Tomo decides to stop drawing, the ink finds other ways to seep into his life\u2014blackouts, threatening messages and the appearance of unexplained sketches. Unsure how to help Tomo, Katie turns to an unexpected source for help\u2014Jun, her former friend and a Kami with an agenda of his own. But is Jun really the ally he claims to be? In order to save themselves, Katie and Tomohiro must unravel the truth about Tomo's dark ancestry, as well as Katie's, and confront one of the darkest gods in Japanese legend. Strengths:Rain extends our knowledge of the Kami world marvelously and I adored getting both more information about the myths about the kami as well as details of how the magic system works in the present day. Katie\u2019s place in this magic system was a bit fuzzy in Ink and it was great to see that clarified and developed in Rain.Katie and Tomo are a pretty adorable couple and now that they are both clear about their devotion to each other, they share plenty of sweet moments in Rain. It is of course not all inked butterflies and rainbows, however, and it was interesting to see how their relationship developed with the added strain of Tomo\u2019s powers growing less controlled.One of my favorite things about Ink were the interior illustrations and Rain continues with this added content. The chapter headers are beautiful along with illustrations based on events in the story.I read a physical copy of Ink, so I don\u2019t know if this is new or not, but my eARC of Rain very helpfully linked new Japanese words to the glossary in the back so that I could easily check the meaning without losing my place. Most of the time there were translations in the text as well, but it was nice to be able to quickly be sure of what the phrase means.Weaknesses: Katie is rather unfortunately good at causing drama. While I did generally understand her motivations, I really wanted to give her a reminder bracelet along the lines of \u201cWhat would a non-dramatic person do?\u201d >.>Rain manages to skirt around a true love triangle, but there is definitely a relationship triangle between Jun, Tomo and Katie that really didn\u2019t seem necessary.While mostly Rain has translations for Japanese words in the text or glossary, there were still occasions when a word showed up again and wasn\u2019t linked or explained. I unfortunately cannot remember all of the words that are defined, so this meant I struggled when words showed up again chapters later.Summary:Rain is a delightfully fun fantasy for fans of anime and Japanese myths. While the relationship drama sometimes felt like a soap opera, I still darn enjoyed this one. I\u2019d say if you\u2019ve read Ink, you have a pretty good idea of whether Katie\u2019s brand of silliness is fun or annoying to you ;-). I am really excited for the third book, though, since the kami world is getting pretty crazy by the end of Rain!"}, {"userName": "Kayleigh {K-Books}", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3996633-kayleigh-k-books", "userReview": "Rain Review on K-Books\n\"If you're going to violate me, I'd appreciate if you wait till I'm naked.\"\nOh My Gods... This book is absolutely phenomenal!I have been dying to get my hands on Rain, the second book in the Paper Gods Series, by Amanda Sun since the moment that I finished Ink. I remember back before Ink was released and I was offered an ARC of it and I turned it down thinking it wasn't really my thing. Then after reading glowing reviews of it from friends and other bloggers picked it up after the release... and then kicking myself for not accepting and reading it sooner. It was just so unique and different and good. After finishing I just needed Rain so bad. To find out what would happen to my favourite characters and so I could vicariously visit Japan again. Rain was everything that I wanted and more. It surpassed all of my, already super high, expectations and just utterly blew me away.Katie has decided to stay in Japan and help Tomohiro fight against the Ink. But as Tomo starts to lose control more and more Katie discovers that her staying just might be making it worse. Discovering a shocking secret about herself that changes everything, trying to help Tomo and trying to stay away from the awful gang who want Tomohiro's power things just got a whole lot more complicated for Katie. She cares about Tomo and he her, but can they fight through the ink to be together or is the ink destined to tear them apart?Rain was utterly phenomenal. Once again Amanda Sun took my breathe away, not only with her phenomenal magical story, but with the magic of writing about Japan. It really makes me feel like I am there and like I really want to go visit this beautiful place. Amanda's writing is so phenomenal and once again it reminds me of how shocked I was that Ink was her debut because she really is that good. She has a talent and skill that makes you think she has been writing for years and years. She really sucks you in at the start of the book and never once lets your attention go until you have demolished the whole book in one sitting. I adore her writing and story-telling and Amanda Sun is fast becoming a favourite and auto-buy author for me. I don't need to know anything about the book if Amanda Sun's name is on it I am reading it.Once again I fell in love with the characters of this series. Katie is an amazing protagonist and I adore her. She really goes through a journey of self-discovery in this one and you really experience every shock, surprise and emotion along with her on the journey. Tomohiro... I just love him. He is sweet, romantic and protective. Everything you could possibly want in a book boyfriend. I loved him.One character surprise I had while reading Rain was I really started to dislike... and then hate... a character I really didn't think I would dislike. Tomo's best friend Shoiri... well she turned out to be an utter bitch in this book and I just wanted to dive in the book and slap her. I really hope that she is in book 3 as little as possible or that she redeems herself in some way.Rain was the perfect follow up to Ink. Gladly it didn't suffer from \"middle-book syndrome\". It was in no way a stepping-stone or a unsatisfying build up to the third book. It was amazing. It was packed full of drama, romance, action and intrigue. I couldn't put the book down and when I found myself having to do something else all I was thinking of is when I could pick the book back up and read more. It was excellent and everything that I love in a book. If you haven't read this series yet I highly suggest that you pick this one up. It really is a gem. A unique, and different book that will not only take your breath away with the story but will take you on the trip of a lifetime to Japan.Utterly phenomenal!\n\"I love Katie. And if that means I have to suffer to keep her safe then that's what I'll do. If it means I have to stand aside so someone else can take care of her because I can't... I will stand aside. That's what love is.\""}, {"userName": "Krutula", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7220682-krutula", "userReview": "American Katie Green has decided to stay in Japan.

In order to save themselves, Katie and Tomohiro must unravel the truth about Tomo's dark ancestry, as well as Katie's, and confront one of the darkest gods in Japanese legend.Rain continues from where Ink left off - Katie decided to stay back and see how life in Japan will go. Moreover, she wants to unravel the mystery of the ink that is somehow drawn to her. Staying back also means being with Tomohiro and for most part of the book they are blissfully together. But Tomo's kami heritage keeps getting between them, almost to the point where the ink starts to attack and get rid of her. Katie wants to find out why the ink is doing this and turns to her best source - Jun, who himself is out to woo Katie. Honestly, there is a bit of soap opera like drama between the three of them and two additional people which tries to undermine the fact that the kami in Tomo is taking over him. The main plotline, of course is the fact that Tomo feels pretty hopeless about his status as a kami - an existence which is plagued with nightmares, and horrible things popping out to kill you. He feels like he should protect Katie from himself, as the ink seems to react to her more. Quitting sketching doesn't have an effect and he doesn't want to stay away from her. Both are trying to make it work but the ink is rebelling. I actually liked Tomo's development in this book. In Ink, he was more of the obnoxious jerk who, though with good intentions, is mean to Katie. In this book, he is sweet, understanding and sensitive to her - and moreover, shows his vulnerable side. Yuki says the boys have a pride thing but not once does he feel annoyed that Katie has to help him out, a fact I admired because if he would have gone all - I don't need no help - damn, dude, you would end up on my hate list. He even doesn't misunderstand the Jun situation and get upset with her (I almost expected that angst) but instead acknowledges her right to choose whom she wants to be with. The despair he feels when he learns his heritage, though - I feel Sun did a really good job of depicting his feelings even in second person. It was raw and heart-breaking, and this was only through Katie's eyes. The writing, well, it is as beautiful as the previous one - dipping into Japanese culture, keeping the feel of the setting alive with lush descriptions. The characters are rendered wonderfully, each one having his or her own agendas and wants. In this book, the conflict (did not see that coming!) which was revealed towards the end gave for a nice climax after building up through the book. The ups and downs of their relationship, and the ties to the history and kami are blended wonderfully. It was a good sequel and I can't wait to see how the things get resolved in the final book.Received an ARC from Harlequin Teen through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Adriyanna Zimmermann", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14361343-adriyanna-zimmermann", "userReview": "When the first book in a series is a 5-star read, there\u2019s always the fear that the sequel won\u2019t live up to the same expectations. I\u2019m happy to say I loved Rain even more than Ink! Our two main characters, Katie and Tomohiro are finding new conflicts to solve almost everyday, and at that more types (which will be explained below). This novel definitely represents the title: it\u2019s raining ink!As I mentioned, Katie and Tomohiro have a lot of problems to solve \u2013 both on a large and small scale. There\u2019s the main one \u2013 trying to find a way to control the ink in Tomo while avoiding the Kami, all with dangerous agendas of their own. However, there\u2019s also the relationship of Katie and Tomohiro. The two are officially dating, but it\u2019s not exactly peaches-and-cream. I find situations like this incredibly intriguing because of the decisions the characters choose to make. Depending on who you ask, the point of a novel is to have a protagonist in an undesirable situation. Every one of their actions will have a ripple effect and it\u2019s up to that character to decide if that effect will be positive or negative. Basically, when the going gets tough how does that character overcome it.I love Sun\u2019s writing! There\u2019s something about it that appears visually beautiful to me, even graceful. Sun always makes a point to immerse the reader in Japanese culture and language. The opening chapter of this book has Katie and Yuki, a friend from school, getting ready for the Abekawa Hanabi festival and it was wonderful to imagine the beautiful yukata (summer kimono) Katie was wearing and all the activities going on. I\u2019ve always wanted to travel to Japan so these are the kind of things I yearn to read.Sun also includes Japanese phrases which both introduces the reader to the language but also helps the reader remember for the majority of the novel, the characters are speaking Japanese. Now that we\u2019re on the subject, although Katie\u2019s Japanese is improving there are still some challenges ahead. Since she\u2019s decided to stay in Japan indefinitely her teachers are harder on her about improving her kanji (Japanese writing) which even native speakers can find difficult to read. As well, the language barrier between Tomohiro and Katie remains. Something as simple as \u201cow, ouch\u201d Katie finds difficult to translate from English, which really puts things in perspective.I feel the plot has grown immensely from Ink, and we see more of the mythology \u2013 which is a huge plus in my book because I live for fantasy! It seemed like there was some new twist revealed on almost every other chapter. Additionally, the characters are traveling more in order to resolve some of their problems. Not only are we reading about other parts of Shizuoka, but we\u2019re visiting shrines and even Mount Fuji. Sun is showing different parts of Japan while still adhering to the plot.For delving deeper into the fantastical elements of The Paper Gods world and having the protagonists face greater obstacles, I give this book five stars. There are some epic fight scenes that have me speculating just how much more outstanding the finale of this series will be. I\u2019m impatiently awaiting for the chance to read Storm (book #3). I strongly recommend this series to anyone wanting to read powerful writing and diverse characters."}], "description": "American Katie Green has decided to stay in Japan.
