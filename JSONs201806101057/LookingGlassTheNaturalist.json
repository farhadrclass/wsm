As it turned out, I was right. God help anyone who would have dared disturb me, it sure wouldn\u2019t have been pretty! This was a book I finished in just one sitting, and in that time, you couldn\u2019t have pried it loose from my hands with a crowbar.This second installment of The Naturalist follows protagonist Theo Cray as he once again digs his heels into a case involving the missing victims of a serial killer. You can jump into it without having read the first book, but just bear in mind there will be some references and spoilers to his time in Montana if you ever have plans to go back and read it. In the aftermath of those events, Theo has become a bit of national celebrity for helping catch a prolific killer, but at the same time, his involvement in such a high-profile case has also made him anathema to the academic community. Stuck doing soul-draining work for the government, Theo finds himself drawn to the hunt again when a distraught father of a missing boy shows up on his doorstep with a request to look into his case.The only problem? Little Christopher Bostrom disappeared nine years ago, and for most investigators this would mean a cold case with no chance of being solved. Theo, however, is scientist who finds patterns, and after crunching some numbers and doing some database searches, the results he finds are disturbing. Not only was Christopher a likely victim of a serial child abductor and murderer, there is evidence that this killer is still on the loose and active today. The only clues Theo has to go on are a couple of kids\u2019 drawings and an eerie urban legend told among elementary school children about a mysterious figure called the Toy Man.The author has done it again. I spent most of this book with my heart in my throat, because even when there wasn\u2019t much action on the page, Mayne was able to keep up the intensity and fast pace with his vivid descriptions of the scientific processes and fascinating facts. Looking Glass was an electrifying book that never had me bored for a second. Because so much of what Theo does also involves computational biology, or the study of the development and application of biological data to generate patterns and models, readers with an interest in any of the related scientific fields will likely eat this one right up.In addition, Theo Cray is fast becoming one of my favorite protagonists. As a vigilante scientist, he\u2019s an unconventional hero, a bit socially awkward and tactless because he\u2019s more used to dealing in facts and not feelings. He\u2019s also frighteningly clever and fast on his feet, using what he knows of social and behavioral patterns to spin elaborate scenarios and identities for himself to get out of sticky situations. What\u2019s more, ever since the events of The Naturalist, Theo\u2019s heart has become hardened which has in turn emboldened him, making him more focused and gutsier when it comes to getting what he needs. When he\u2019s not keeping me on the edge of my seat with his high-risk escapades, he\u2019s making me laugh with his reckless yet ingenious stunts like that one particular incident involving an Amazon delivery box and glowing bacteria. At the end of the day, Theo Cray is a weirdo nerd, and I love him for both his intellect and humor.As for the story, I won\u2019t be going into too much detail because the less you know going in, the better it is going to be. Suffice to say Mayne knows how to get a reader\u2019s blood racing. One small lead from a cold case ends up snowballing into a series of bombshell clues which lead to even bigger and more shocking discoveries. From my experience with The Naturalist, I already know the author is not afraid to go all out, even if it means delving into the realm of the incredible and far-fetched, though in the context of this tale it was easy to just follow along. I\u2019m certainly glad I did with Looking Glass, because I can\u2019t remember the last time I had this much fun with a book.Hard to believe the first book could have been topped, but I believe Andrew Mayne has done it. I love this series so much, it\u2019s almost ridiculous how badly I want to read more right now. I\u2019m thrilled to discover a third book is already in the works, but the bad news is that it\u2019s not listed to come out until early next year. Oh, this wait is seriously going to suck\u2026"}, {"userName": "Juli", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli", "userReview": "Professor Theo Cray has a reputation as a rogue scientist willing to do anything to catch a killer. Having just used every scientific and investigative tool at his disposal to catch a serial killer in Montana, Cray is approached by a father whose son disappeared 9 years before. The police assumed the boy was involved in gang activity because the area of South California he disappeared in is known for violence. His father knows better. Cray agrees to look into it, and finds that a killer called the \"Toy Man'' has been stalking, enticing and murdering young, black boys for years. Once again acting outside of law enforcement, Cray is on the trail of a dangerous serial killer and making use of every revolutionary scientific approach he knows to pinpoint a suspect, getting himself into hot water again in the process.Looking Glass is the second book in the Naturalist series, but the first book by Andrew Mayne that I have read. Readers can jump in and start the series with book two like I did, but be forewarned that lots of information about the first story is revealed during the second book. I don't mind....I'm still going to backtrack and read the first book, even though I know who the killer is already and some of the events leading up to his capture. Cray is an interesting character. He is highly intelligent and very knowledgeable about scientific investigation, procedure and testing. He thinks in a purely logical manner, which makes emotion and social situations a bit tough for him. He tends to come off as a jerk, but it's really just directness and true knowledge, not know-it-all jerkishness. He annoys law enforcement because he bypasses their investigations when they refuse to listen to him. He solves cases they can't solve themselves and doesn't care whose toes he steps on. When I first started Looking Glass, I had a hard time liking this character. He really did come off as a bit of a self-absorbed academic. But, then I got pulled into the story and came to understand that Theo Cray merely looks at all things in a purely logical and scientific manner. He has a goal and uses everything in his disposal to reach that goal -- this time, it's catching a serial killer preying on children. It wasn't long before I was totally on Cray's side, forgiving him for his personality.This story is well-written and just amazing. The suspense is fantastic and the investigation is incredibly interesting. Cray has access to new scientific tests and tools that help him ferret out clues. Whether or not these things are actually available I have no clue....but the science seemed credible enough to me. I'm no expert....so I just went with the flow and enjoyed the story. Loved it! By the end, I was completely immersed in the story. The ending is fantastic! (No spoilers from me! Read the book!)A third book in this series, Murder Theory, will be coming out in February, 2019. I can't wait!! I will be backtracking to read the first book, The Naturalist. Andrew Mayne has written several other books including the Station Breaker series and the Jessica Blackwood novels. I will be reading his other books while I wait for the new Theo Cray novel.**I voluntarily read a review copy of this novel from Thomas & Mercer via NetGalley.

The father of a missing child has been ignored by law enforcement and sees Theo as the last hope for finding his child. The only clue is the child\u2019s bike still where the boy was last seen, and stories of \u201cThe Toy Man.\u201d As Theo investigates, it\u2019s clear that this is a case of more than one missing child. Mayne has written an opening that tears at your heart but won\u2019t let you stop reading. One is drawn into the suspense almost immediately. You are also drawn to the character\u2014\u201cWhat does your get say?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a scientist. I\u2019ve trained myself not to have a gut.\u201d One is also drawn to the fact that Mayne is an author who truly makes one think\u2014\u201cThe real danger is that the good guys will blindly keep doing bad things that they don\u2019t see as bad. It\u2019s why people who would give the shirt off their back to help the poor and the hungry will then march against genetically modified food, even if such food products could save millions of children from blindness or starvation. It\u2019s when people who want democracy in the Middle East find themselves building military bases instead of schools and hospitals.\u201d \tThis is one painful book to read. One is only peripherally aware of how many children, in fact, especially those from families of illegals, broken homes and those afraid to talk to the authorities are missing and that there is next to nothing being done to find them. A major clue in the story is nearly as disturbing, but very effective for it so being. One weakness the plot has is the redundant references back to Cray\u2019s previous case. It almost seems to be a plot filler and takes the effectiveness away from this story. There is, however, one link made which does work\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t think just because you survived one monster you\u2019ll survive the next. I\u2019m alive because I kept running from them. Not to them.\u201d Mayne does creepy well. He excels at creepy. He creates visual images that may stay with one, but one certainly hopes they don\u2019t.The scientific information can, at times, be a bit overwhelming. But it is fascinating and not so complex that one doesn\u2019t get the gist of what is being conveyed. Even Cray\u2019s analysis can make one think\u2014\u201cEvery murder has at least five important factors: a victim, a means of death, a location, a time, and a murderer. Solving for one or more of them can lead you to a solution, much like an equation, assuming they\u2019re not all random.\u201d The link between the killings is unique. And then Mayne introduces the tried, true, and highly effective element of racing against the clock.It helps that Mayne\u2019s humor lightens the darkness of the events\u2014\u201cThere has to be some other distraction that doesn\u2019t involve a siren and dead hostages. Shit. There is. There\u2019s actually an app for that.\u201d He throws in an effective plot twist, and some excellent advice--\u201cNever believe anything that\u2019s reported in the first twenty-four hours. In the age of social media, this is especially true.\u201dThe story contains a lot of information, some of which may not interest everyone but may well fascinate others. One might wish for author notes. \u201cLooking Glass\u201d is a twisty, grim, and takes one to unexpected places. While not Mayne\u2019s best book, it keeps one reading non-stop from page one to the very end.LOOKING GLASS (Trad Mys-Theo Cray-US-Contemp) \u2013 G+\tMayne, Andrew \u2013 2nd in series\tThomas & Mercer \u2013 March, 2018"}, {"userName": "Mel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7599851-mel", "userReview": "The Naturalist was my favorite ... until now!I love the flow, the humor, the characters & creative twists in the storyline!

Computational biologist, mathematical and programming genius, Dr. Theo Cray (formerly Professor, University of Texas-Austin), is without a doubt my favourite protagonist. (I can only think of one other protagonist and one highly important secondary character I admire as much, and both of those are found in John Connolly's Charlie Parker series.) Theo is an exceptional individual, a character who is so self-analytical but almost constantly doubting his human traits, an intellectual genius, a scientist with incomparable value to science, academia, law enforcement, business and industry, government, because he is a savant at spotting patterns. What he doesn't see on his own recognizance, he codes programs to find. He could be so valuable, but bureaucracy and egotism rule, so instead of being applauded, his own academia jettisoned him, certain law enforcement agencies basically despise him, and now he is employed by a subcontractor working on Defense Intelligence Agency research. But you can't keep a facile brain muzzled, and quickly Theo finds himself drawn into a horrid ongoing killing series spanning decades, involving children, international politics, conspiracy and cover-ups--and black magic. I kid you not. Theo nearly didn't survive his first encounter in The Naturalist; he's likely not to survive this either."}, {"userName": "Tom Swift", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31185245-tom-swift", "userReview": "Great SeriesThis is the second installment of The Naturalist series.

It felt like it should have been a one-off, but now I'm super glad that he wrote another one (and I hope that he continues with the series). Cray is an amazing lead and the topics that Mayne has covered (both serial killers but totally different reasons) were both fascinating to dig into. I want to know how Cray reacts to other topics/killers.I will warn those - Looking Glass features some very adult themes and could trigger readers who don't like to hear about rape or pedophilia - I thought that Mayne does a good job avoiding these scenes in detail but you can't avoid the fact that is what is going on behind the scenes.A \"detective thriller\" with a\u00a0scientist/vigilante at the helm - The Naturalist series, including Looking Glass was one of the best books I've read in a while.\u00a0 I loved it."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4440925-debbie", "userReview": "Yes!!!! Looking Glass lived up to it's predecessor and was everything I hoped it would be. As I reader, I always worry that a sequel will not be as good as the first. My worries were unfounded. I loved every minute of this one almost as much as the first. I say almost only because there is nothing like the first love, the first intro to a beloved character, story and author. Firsts can never really be duplicated but Looking Glass is an excellent second. The author took everything I loved about the first book and amped it up to version 2.0.To my delight, Looking Glass has a darker, more sinister feel to it. Maybe it is that the killer targeting kids, maybe it is that a shadowy arm of the government enabling the killer, maybe it was the disturbingly twisted details of the crime scenes, or that my beloved Theo Cray actually grew a set and became more disciplined, careful and calculated. Whatever it was the combination payed off and delighted me. Yeah, dark and delightful really do go together, at least for me.Theo Cray has grown from the likable, yet naive, un-hero to better equipped more controlled seeker of justice. Theo walked rather than stumbled into this hunt of the Toy Man, thought to be an urban myth but who turns out to be all too real, preying upon children of inner cities. As with the first in this series, I didn't always understand every detail of the science but appreciated it none the less, after all, we are following a computation biologist who uses science to track his prey. The science and the details are as much a part of the story as the characters. The author continues to push boundaries of reality in creating this thrilling, fast paced and completely unique story that will stay with me for a long, long while. If you are a stickler for realism, details grounded in absolute fact and can't handle creative license, then move right along. This requires the reader have the ability to stretch their imagination and allow the author to work his magic."}, {"userName": "Smile24k", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51418414-smile24k", "userReview": "I would actually rate this book 3.5 stars, but since that is not an option, I'm going to be a little generous and go with 4 stars. This review will probably focus more on what I didn't like, so let me say first that I did like this book. The beginning and middle of the book really pull you in and there are points where you don't want to put the book down. I do most of my reading on my train commute to work and one day I actually missed my stop because I was so engrossed in this book! This book went from being a solid 4 stars to 3.5 based on the ending.In short:1. Is this book as good as the first? --In my opinion, No.2. Is this book worth reading? --Yes, but read book 1 first.This book finds Theo Cray working for a contractor doing what I would describe as high-tech virtual spying. He's still mentally recovering from his last encounter with a serial killer, when a father of a missing boy asks for his help in finding his son's killer. Theo agrees to help, reluctantly. Off we go to hunt a killer using Theo's brand of science lead investigation techniques.I read the first book and I was completely drawn in to Theo Cray's quirky mind. I loved the nerdy science stuff that was interesting and still seemed plausible. This book has some of the same nerdy science that I loved, but at times there was just too much. There were points in the book where Theo was on to something, but then went into too much detail describing the science behind it. The first book did a better job of balancing. But, I could have overlooked this because it wasn't a major distraction. What bothered me about this otherwise solid and entertaining book, is the ending.No spoilers. I feel like the ending was rushed. There was no satisfaction of knowing the killer's motivation or how many he killed. There was Theo's speculation on the motivation, but it was never confirmed or resolved in a satisfying way. Also, the twist with the killer's identity was not explained well. Why was he valuable enough to be protected? I would have liked a little more back story. There are other issues with the ending that I won't go into because of spoilers, but it just felt rushed and unresolved. The series is worth getting into, but read book 1 first. You don't have to read book 1 in order to understand book 2, but book 1 is the better book.

I\u2019m not going to give too much of a story recap for this book, because I certainly don\u2019t want to spoil anything for you. But I will tell you what I love about Mayne\u2019s plotting and characters, and hopefully you\u2019ll want to jump into this series as well. \nLooking Glass\n is a completely separate story from \nThe Naturalist\n, and even though a few events from the first book are mentioned, this can easily be read as a standalone.Dr. Theo Cray now works for a private defense contractor called OpenSkyAI, a company that secretly keeps tabs on people all over the world who may be about to commit terrible crimes. By studying patterns, the employees can determine who to focus on and hopefully stop bad things before they happen. Theo is also recovering from his harrowing experience at the end of The Naturalist, the result of which has made him somewhat of a celebrity. His talents at finding missing persons and tracking down dangerous serial killers attract the attention of desperate people who want help finding loved ones or simply answers that law enforcement could never give them.One day Theo is approached by a man named William Bostrom, whose son Chris went missing nine years ago. The case is cold, since the police were never able to find out what happened to Chris, and William thinks Theo is just the guy to help him out. Theo\u2019s investigation brings him to the Los Angeles suburb of Compton, where he uncovers an urban myth that may have some truth to it. A mysterious black man who drives a white Cadillac and is rumored to lure young boys into his car with promises of toys has been dubbed the Toy Man by locals, although no one can say for sure whether he actually exists or not. As Theo follows one lead after another, he\u2019s drawn into a dark world where children disappear and are never seen again. But the closer he gets to the truth, the more dangerous his investigation becomes. Unfortunately, Theo Cray isn\u2019t the kind to back down.I think I mentioned this in my review of The Naturalist, but if you\u2019re a fan of the TV shows Bones or Dexter then you will most likely love this series. I happen to love stories that deal with forensic science and investigation, and there is plenty of that in \nLooking Glass\n. In \nThe Naturalist\n, Theo used his knowledge of botany to locate dead bodies, and here he gets a little more techy and uses all kinds of cool gadgets and profiling software, some of which he invented, to search databases in order to narrow down the list of suspects. Theo reminds me a lot of MacGyver when he\u2019s using his problem solving skills, and I never got tired of marveling at how quickly he jumps to conclusions or comes up with unique ways to figure stuff out. He\u2019s also pretty gifted in the physical department. He\u2019s got all sorts of fighting skills like karate, he knows how to handle a gun, and he\u2019s fast when he needs to be. You may be thinking to yourself, \u201cIs there anything Theo can\u2019t do?\u201d and I\u2019m pretty sure the answer to that is \u201cno.\u201dTheo is also not above breaking the law in order to get the evidence he needs, or to set up surveillance cameras, or a hundred other little things he thinks of that will help him with his (sometimes illegal) investigations. He\u2019s so crafty and he gets away with things so often that I couldn\u2019t help but marvel at the way his brain works. Let\u2019s just say that if I ever needed help solving a crime, I\u2019d definitely want someone like Theo Cray to help me out!Because this is a story about trying to track down an elusive serial killer, Mayne includes lots of fascinating (and terrifying!) tidbits on some of history\u2019s most infamous real-life serial killers. Clearly Theo has done his homework, and he gives the reader glimpses of how hard it is to actually catch killers. One example that he mentions involves the police sitting across the street from Ted Bundy\u2019s house, watching him wash his car in plain sight\u2014literally washing any evidence of his crimes away\u2014while waiting for a warrant to arrest him. Mayne gives us lots of chilling examples of near misses, the police mere yards away from the killer but unable to do anything about it because of red tape.And while there are some extreme over-the-top moments in this story, I forgave all of them because I had such a great time reading this book. Andrew Mayne is such a natural-born storyteller, and using Theo Cray to tell his stories works so well for this series. I\u2019m thrilled that there is a third book in the works called \nMurder Theory\n (coming out next year) and I\u2019m already salivating at the thought of another adventure with Theo Cray. Highly recommended!Big thanks to the publisher for supplying a review copy.This review originally appeared on Books, Bones & Buffy"}, {"userName": "Irene", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52453548-irene", "userReview": "Looking Glass (The Naturalist #2) by Andrew MayneSecond book in The Naturalist Series. I felt a bit of disappointment in the direction the book went after the first book of the series. A lot more violence, swearing It seemed like Theo underwent a personality change from Professor to alpha warrior. A bit confusing at times but fast paced and people who like the action packed, thriller books will most likely enjoy it. Thank you to the publisher, author, and NetGalley for the opportunity to preview the book."}, {"userName": "Ankita Aranake", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15454643-ankita-aranake", "userReview": "Obviously loved it, read it within 24 hrs of its release on kindle.....my only comment being the villains need to be explained a bit better - their motives, how they zone in on their targets, etc. I don't think they were exactly shrouded in mystery but merely not explained properly. Interests stems from the fact that they are fascinating villains! I WANT to know more about them."}, {"userName": "Adelaide Metzger", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5829242-adelaide-metzger", "userReview": "\u201cDon\u2019t think just because you survived one monster you\u2019ll survive the next.\u201d--Looking Glass Chapter 24.One of my favorite literary characters ever, Dr. Theo Cray, is BACK PEOPLE!!! Oh my God, I love him so much! The man\u2019s brilliant brain holds him back from understanding certain emotions in his personal life, but he has a huge heart for people who need his help and will hunt down the evil that law enforcement has no power over\u2014even if it means putting himself in death\u2019s way. I feel like this second installment was a bit slower than the first book. I found myself losing some interest in several chapters during the very thorough investigation. I found most of the explanatory chapters very educational and interesting as they made me give credit to Andrew Mayne for his research and knowledge such as what the Fourier method is, but chapters like the one explaining how a face-tracker system functions had me skimming pass the info. One thing that did not bore me while carefully stepping my way through this book was the creep factor. My skin crawled with every chapter as Theo quickly unveiled what kind of killer he was dealing with. While the first book deconstructed the murder mystery under the theme of nature and Animalia, this book takes a darker turn. Without giving away too much I will say it involves children and the occult. Theo comes face-to-face with a killer that is silent, agile, and even snake-like as opposed to his experience in the first book where the killer resembled a large, hungry bear.I do feel that I didn\u2019t get to see the killer as much in this book compared to the first installment. While Theo is forced into an epic life-or-death faceoff with Joe Vik in the climax of the previous book, in Looking Glass he simply tracks down the guy and briefly scrapes by him twice before the ending. That doesn\u2019t mean the killer isn\u2019t just as deadly, or that the stakes aren\u2019t higher, but does make me hungry for a bit more action. My gut reaction every time I finish one of these is \u201cThis would make an epic movie!\u201d But the more I think on it I feel like pulling a very wise Ken Levine move and saying, \u201cWell\u2026only if they do it right.\u201d In the hands of people like James Wan and Leigh Whannell it would probably be perfect in its own way of an adaptation, but in any other hands I\u2019d have trust issues. If you can get pass the extensive breakdown during the investigation portion of these books, you should definitely give them a try. They aren\u2019t your everyday crime thrillers and Andrew Mayne is no penny-crime author. Number three, please?"}], "description": "Professor Theo Cray caught one of the most prolific serial killers in history using revolutionary scientific methods.
