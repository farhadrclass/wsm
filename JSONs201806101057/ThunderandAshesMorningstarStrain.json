I expected the sequel to be about the same or possibly worse than the first, but I really enjoyed the concept of 28 Days Later style infected who turn into shambling zombies after being killed.

Society has almost completely crumbled worldwide. Francis Sherman is leading the ragtag remnants of a group of soldiers and refugees across the U.S. from the west coast to hopefully meet up with friend and Morningstar expert, Anna Demilio, in Omaha at a research facility where they hope to develop a vaccine. Sherman has new problems not limited to zombies. Supplies are low and hard to come by, and gangs of still living people want to take whatever they can. Anna\u2019s group is working its way from D.C. but she has her own issues since she\u2019s being hunted by a rogue group of government intelligence types that have gone off the deep end and want her secured.Like Plague of the Dead, this is B-level zombie fun with very black-and-white characters and lots of faux-military style jargon and plenty of action. It\u2019s not up to the levels of World War Z or The Walking Dead or Breathers, but if you\u2019re craving a story about flesh eating zombies taking over the world, I\u2019ve read far worse. It\u2019s the equivalent of catching a decent horror movie on cable when you weren\u2019t expecting much out of it and being pleasantly surprised."}, {"userName": "Daniel Black", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4351564-daniel-black", "userReview": "Succinctly, Z. A. Recht loves the zombie genre, with a military edge. He has developed some interesting twists on the standard elements.The execution is sophomoric. The characters are almost strictly stereotypes, the tension vehicles are overplayed, and there is no worry that the good guys will win out. No sense that this couldn't be a Hollywood script.Still, I found it easier to finish than Brian Keene's _The Rising_, which reads as the work of a man who wants to hurt women and make money with as little effort as possible. It was also easier to finish than _The Fall_, book two of _The Strain_ trilogy by Guillermo del Toro. I think Chuck Hogan wrote the first book of that trilogy, as it's much tighter and better-executed than _The Fall_ by far._Thunder and Ashes_ is energetic and for all its glaring faults warm and human. The pity is that Recht won't be able to hone his writing and push his enthusiasm further."}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "Thunder and Ashes starts out where the first book left off in this trilogy. We have the split story, one of General Sherman and his team of army men and civilians making their way from the west coast towards Omaha, hoping to meet up with Anna Demilio and her much smaller group coming in from the east coast. They are racing towards a facility where they hope to hatch a vacine for the Morningstar virus, the plague that has swept over the world creating two forms of plague victims, one still alive, fast, and brutally violent, and one undead, slower, but just as dangerous and canibalistic. I could have given this story a full five stars, it does rate that based on the action in the story. General Sherman's march was far more interesting to me, especially his pit stop in a little town in Kansas, than the more brief excerpts from Anna and Mason's more silent trek, but their stories tie together nicely, with plague victims, raiders, and rogue government agents all nipping at their heels. The story is cohesive and written with a certain amount of zip to it. I am no military expert so I have no reason or desire to punch holes in the author's use of various terms and equipment. Again, the story and its use of military armaments are smooth and seamless. We are provided with an action packed zombie thriller as two sets of people are racing against the clock, not even sure what they are racing towards will mean anything in the end, but they are determined to do whatever it takes to get there and try to spare humanity any more agony from this brutal virus, if at all possible. Where I would be critical of this book is in more or less minor details that unveil themselves towards the end of the story and I hesitate to spell them out because I have no interest in revealing plot points. Suffice it to say that there were two key things that happen that I did not feel were specifically needed to advance the story. One scene simply felt redundant, an echo of a scene from the first book in the trilogy having to do with one on one combat...almost laying the groundwork for a very similar scene in book three. The other issue I have lies within the epilogue and what I would deem an incredibly convenient story element revealed that will play a huge part in the final installment of this trilogy. I suppose I am just not a fan of something that the odds of happening are one in a billion revealing themselves so conveniently. Please understand, these are really minor issues for me and as such do not want them to be considered deterents for anyone interested in picking up this story. The writing is fast paced, the characters are entertaining, and the story is fun. Perhaps some of the characterizations are a bit exagerated, but when you are dealing with an end of the world type plague, I can certainly understand how some folks would seem a bit over the top. I found myself growing attached to quite a few of the characters and really look forward to finding out what happens in the final chapter of the Morningstar Trilogy. This was a genuinely fun and exhilerating zombie romp."}, {"userName": "Elisa ", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5133558-elisa", "userReview": "4.5 stars - These are some of my favorite zombie books! Even though there are military characters, it isn't all military action. There are some normal folks who can kick some butt. It is exciting, a few groups are all making their way to the same spot, bad humans as well as zombies get in the way.

Great stuff."}, {"userName": "chucklesthescot", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3426724-chucklesthescot", "userReview": "The first thing I need to say before getting into the review is that it will have spoilers to a few things that happen in book one, so if you read this and haven't read book one, it will spoil the story for you! As this is one of my favourite zombie series EVER I urge you to read the books before my reviews if you love zombie action! OK now strap yourself in and lets get into this review.It picks up exactly where the first one cuts off. Sherman's group get back on the road after the disaster at Hyattsburg and decide to stop at an airport. Mark Styles, bitten on the supply run in town, hides in a comic book store to wait for the end. Anna's group realise that Sawyer knows where they plan to go and is stalking them, ready to ambush them at any moment. Those remaining on the USS Ramage decide to abandon ship and follow the route they think Sherman took, hoping to catch up to them on the road. With everyone now on American soil, they have to be aware of rampaging zombies, unfriendly locals and dangerous bandits.This book moves at breakneck speed, following three main groups-Sherman, Harris and Anna. The story switches between the three as they all head towards the secure facility, and the tension is pretty much non stop. The action scenes again are brilliantly written, leaving you anxious about your favourite characters. There are zombie attacks, corrupt psycho agents, rescue raids, bandit attacks, and survivors trying to rebuild communities in protected towns. It is not just about the action and zombie gore, it is about groups of people trying to stay alive and remain people, not monsters. Character wise, I loved the introduction of the community at Abraham, who agree to help Sherman's team repair vehicles damaged by the bandits, if the military men will help to rescue the women that the bandits took hostage. This leads to a whole new danger, not just in the actual raid, but the war that will start between Abraham and the bandits. Anna's group discover that Sawyer has gone rogue and wants to capture Anna because he believes that she already has a cure and he wants it. Her group have to deal with repeated attempts on their lives by Sawyer and his allies, while Sherman is dealing with a full scale combined bandit and zombie attack on the town. There is certainly never a dull moment in this sequel! Harris and his men have to run the gauntlet in Hyattsburg as they correctly guess that Sherman has gone this way and get a few surprises there.Harris realises that they may have the key to a cure if they can get to the facility safely and they have no way of contacting Anna or Sherman for help or to tell them of their discovery. Sawyer has sent people ahead to the facility to lay a trap for Anna. Anna and Sherman are both en route to the facility...and things are getting very exciting! I'm not going to go into details of the plot or who survives and dies but each time I read this series, I am still caught up in the story even when I know what will happen. It was so good to read and so well written. It was sad that the author died after completion of this book, at the age of 26, which was tragic on an epic scale for his loved ones. These were his first two books and we can only imagine all the wonderful stories that he had planned for a future that sadly he never got to see. His publisher and author Thom Brannan, agreed to use his notes to complete the trilogy which was a fitting tribute. I can tell you that the third novel does not disappoint and will be reviewed by me shortly. Zombie fans really need to treat themselves to this brilliant series!"}, {"userName": "Julie Smith (Knitting and Sundries)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3133122-julie-smith-knitting-and-sundries", "userReview": "Three bands of survivors, all working their way to the same place - a research facility in Omaha, Nebraska where a vaccine for the Morningstar virus can possibly be developed.The first group are former soldiers from the U.S.S. Ramage: Krueger, Keaton, Thomas, Wilson, Brewster and former General Sherman. Also with them are Mbutu, Ron, Katie, Rebecca (a nurse), Jack and Mitsui (both former general contractors with the latter speaking Japanese only), and Denton, a photographer.The second group consists of Anna Demilio, a doctor from USAMRIID, who may prove to be the key to uncovering a vaccine for Morningstar, Julie Ortiz, the anchorwoman who Anna leaked the story to in hopes of containing the virus before it became a pandemic, and Gregory Mason, formerly of the NSA, all wanted for murder and treason by the U.S. Army. Mason helped Julie and Anna escape when they were being held captive by his former peers. They are joined on their journey by Trev, a former mental patient with exceedingly clear mental facilities, and HIS companions, Matt and Junko, former students.The third group enters the trek much later in the book. These are the remaining sailors from the USS Ramage, joined by a civilian named Hal who had been given the boot from his retirement island in the Pacific by the natives when he insisted that the inhabitants should extend hospitality to the crew of the Ramage. Having found no safe port, with dwindling food and fuel supplies, and with the U.S. military apparently scattered into the wind, they decide to meet up with Sherman, their former general.This is the second in the Morningstar trilogy, and, thankfully, you did not have to read the first to become immersed in it's sequel.Thankfully, for the more squeamish, there is not a lot of gore (although people and zombies DO die along the way).Very well-written, and not just about the zombies, there is a good story in these pages, with characters you'll come to care about, good dialogue, and plenty of action. Surprisingly, most of the danger in this book comes not from the sprinters (living people who were infected by the virus and \"turned\") or the shamblers (people infected by the virus who subsequently died and were reborn as zombies), but from the uninfected. There are bandits, and raiders, and a rogue faction of the U.S. military that our survivors have to deal with along the way. This is enough to make me want to go back and purchase the first in the series, \"Plague of the Dead\".QUOTES:\"Right,\" Krueger said, scoffing. \"When was the last time we met someone new who didn't try to eat us, huh?\"Beneath the truck, Brewster grimaced and rolled his eyes. \"Leave it to Krueger to go all primadonna in the middle of a firefight.\"\"What I'm saying is that most of the smart people are dead and you're still alive. Whether or not you have a degree, that makes you one of the world's best engineers,\" Anna said, nodding once and tapping the screen of her PDA to bring up another page of data. \"Just a matter of the process of elimination.\"Julie, still leaning back with her eyes closed, shrugged at the thought. \"Never did think of it like that. I guess that makes me prime material for this year's Pulitzer Prize for broadcast journalism.\"Book Rating: 4.0 out of 5 starsOn researching the author and the book, I found that Z. A. Recht died last year at the tender age of 26, At the time of his death, he was working on the third and final installment of the series, \"Survivors\", which was going through edits. It is being completed by a ghostwriter, although I was not able to locate a release date."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3835702-kat", "userReview": "I'm always a little wary of the second book in a trilogy, but reading Thunder and Ashes was a bit different than normal. Although The Morningstar Strain is a trilogy, this is the last book in the series fully written by Z.A. Recht (the third one is partly ghost-written) and I've read it several years ago, so I was pretty much aware of what I was getting myself into.The first book in the series, Plague of the Dead, is very much about establishing the characters, the virology and the collapse of the world in the wake of a zombie apocalypse. Thunder and Ashes focuses more on just a few particular events, and how the remnants of the human race are faring as they try and survive. There are goodies, baddies and several characters that cross the line between one 'side' and the other, but it does lack further character development. One thing that I did find very frustrating was that in the last book characters made mistakes because of emotional reactions which was realistic, however in Thunder and Ashes they made stupid mistakes that I couldn't understand - going into a town that obviously has seen some bad shit go down just to 'check it out' isn't something I would expect from a group of highly trained military.In Thunder and Ashes, some of the characters that appear to be key characters in the first book start to fall into the background which is a shame, but the others start to really establish themselves as leaders, fighters and hardcore survivors. There is a continuation of the focus on the military and the search for a cure, with both plot lines crossing into each other constantly.Like Plague of the Dead, there are a lot of action scenes, and all of them exceedingly well-written with some heart-stopping moments as things hang in the balance, daring rescues take place and the defence of pockets of survivors take top priority. Although there are action scenes in the first book, in this one the stakes feel infinitely higher and more personal, which I really enjoyed.As a 'middle' book, it's not a bad book, but there were some disappointments for me in the character development, and although the pace is frenetic it didn't really feel like events were particularly moving forward. However, this is definitely a book for post-apocalyptic and zombie fans and a good continuation of the series.Read more of my reviews atThe Aussie Zombie"}, {"userName": "Tiffany ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6812486-tiffany", "userReview": "In Thunder and Ashes, the second book in Z. A. Recht's The Morningstar Strain, readers pick up with the survivors three months later. The Morningstar Strain has swept the globe, and the survivors find themselves divided, but trying to find their way towards each other in an effort to create a vaccine. As Dr. Demilio and her group flee from rogue NSA agents to a research facility in Omaha, General Sherman and his compatriots trek from the west coast towards the good doctor. Along the way, the soldiers must fight their way through Shamblers looking for their next meal.I found Thunder and Ashes to be even more riveting, because the danger seemed more intense. As the survivors transversed across the United States, every corner seemed to lurk danger. Like the first novel, Recht doesn't shy away from killing off main characters, which upped the stakes. Also, I found myself more invested in the characters now that I've gotten to know them more, and have certain ones I hated to see go. Unlike many books in this genre I read, I find I really like all of the characters and root for their survival.As I head into the third and final novel, Survivors, I'm worried about the fate of the characters, and wonder if it's even possible for them to be victorious. Z. A. Recht's The Morningstar Strain series is a well-written horror series, packed full of action, with complex characters. Even if you aren't a fan of zombie stories, I still think this series is worth a look, at it really showcases human nature. Besides, I've been on a military novel streak this past year, and this series fits fight in. A great war story, a great suspenseful thriller, and a great story about people.

While not particularly original, Recht demonstrated a genuine talent for action and suspense, and created a vivid zombie scorched earth that made his characters' fear seem real.Unfortunately I didn't feel the same about Thunder and Ashes. Firstly, Recht's prose came across like a fan-boy describing his Call-of-Duty gameplay. Where Plague had skilful plainspeak, Thunder and Ashes, came across as an early draft of a good manuscript with lots of lazy 'tell' exposition and phrases like 'sniping away'to describe gun battle, which gave the book a silly tone which didn't match the setting.I guess Thunder and Ash does suffer from middle book sag, a difficult trend to avoid given that the book is not only a sequel but a second book in a trilogy, thus needing to save some epic-ness for number three. Nonetheless I found the characters and plot fell unacceptably flat. Recht relies on us remembering who everyone is, some would say this is OK in a sequel, but I argue that sequel characters still need to 'show' their character throughout the story even if they have already been introduced.while there is a small amount of character development, for the most part I found it difficult to tell the difference between the 'slightly bad-ass soldier types' populating this novel and even more difficult to care too much about their fate.The storyline feels like a few challenges were thrown at the characters but nothing nearly as epic at the first novel, and - I hope - what is to come in number three.Don't get me wrong, there are still epic and tense battles, but like the Matrix sequels without being surrounded by a strong plot and characters exciting action couldn't bring this novel above 2 stars for me"}, {"userName": "Meg Day", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4742571-meg-day", "userReview": "Well as i Reviewed the First book \"Plague of the Dead\" i felt like that book was lacking and it didn't keep my interest as i thought it might..but i read the second one anyway; \"Thunder and ashes\". I have to say i definitely enjoyed this book much better than the first i thought that the first book was a lot of explaining and people fighting other people and little Z action, However the second book has a really great mix of both People and Zombie action. I enjoyed how they ran into other people and sometimes they were friendly and sometimes they weren't. and i also liked how the setting was changing because they were on the road compared to the first one where the first few chapters they were on a boat ( like so many other zombie novels)I also enjoyed that it switched from dimallio's story line to sherman's. HOWEVER, there is a little third story line that the author adds in at the very end of the book, which i didn't understand why he did that all, it was frusting because 3/4 the way through the book he added another group of people on the way to Omaha and i was like WTF, Who the f are they and why should i care!! but then your questions are answered in the epilogue...which i think he should have done the whole little extra thing in the epilogue."}, {"userName": "Andrew Etheridge", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12307045-andrew-etheridge", "userReview": "This book is the sequel to the first book I did.

I mean, if you don't like zombies, just don't read it.However, as a true zombie enthusiast I have to say that this book is a true masterpiece. It a true example of what a zombie book should be  WITHOUT UNNECESSARY  details like:a) shitty (and usually teenage) love stories b) stereotypical \"I used to suck at life but now my gaming time has paid off\" charactersSo, why has this book earned 5 stars?a) IT'S REALISTIC - it follows a group of people, mostly what remains from US Army, so it's believable that they actually score headshots and are able to walk as much as they do or that they have specific knowledge. Also, there is no endless ammo.b) THE VIRUS THING IS EXPLAINED - this is what is usually lacking in most zombie books, no one tells you anything about the virus. However, here you have explained how it happened, why, the research thingies and an idea to make a vaccine. Also, it's important to mention that virus is explained quite realistically, one can notice that the author had read something about virology.c) IT FOCUSES ON THE IMPORTANT THINGS - like staying alive, looting and some \"big picture\" plans like finding a vaccine. Other zombie novels often revolve too much around unimportant things like love or finding some lost third cousin that you probably seen once instead of just trying to survive. The relations between characters are just briefly described. d) CHARACTERS ARE NOT RETARDED - of course, until you are completely sure about how the virus is passed on, you are going to do some stupid things, but once the characters have realized how one gets infected they stopped being retarded. Also, a lot of people shot themselves when they realized they are going to get infected, when they suspected that someone was infected - they quarantined them and so on. Also, once they realized its the headshots that do the job - they shot them there, simple. e) FAST AND SLOW ZOMBIES - perfectly explained and there are both types in the book with a realistic explanation as well.f) GORE - perfect amount of gore, there are few scenes, but not a lot. Because author realized that he is not writing a Rob Zombie fan-fiction, but a normal book. To conclude, if one has read the previous book in the serial Plague of the Dead, one would notice how much has the author perfected his style. The descriptions are not as brief as in the first book, there is less military speech and so on. P.S.

I'd give it 1 star but the strength of the zombie mechanics was so, that it got me through the whole trilogy. This book will stay with me for a long time, unfortunately. This is one of those books where the film would outshine the book."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10308976-sue", "userReview": "Well, goodness, I am loving this series! Action, zombies, shamblers, soldiers, sailors, bad people, good people and above all, more action. I actually like the characters and mourn just a bit if they die but this moves along so quickly that there is no time to be spent regretting a loss. I'm starting right in on the third one of the series and can hardly wait to get going."}, {"userName": "Tim Martin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7261720-tim-martin", "userReview": "I don't quite understand, but I liked this submediocre book. The characters were likable but not realistic. The plot was dumb in places but acceptable. It was definitely better than the first book in the series. I suppose I liked it because it did its job, if only barely."}, {"userName": "Missy~", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1132228-missy", "userReview": "Liked this one better than the first."}, {"userName": "Christie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1817343-christie", "userReview": "Thunder and Ashes follows three groups of Morningstar Virus survivors. When infected the virus causes you to become the living dead. The first set is lead by a couple of military men who are trying to get to Omaha. Over the course of their travels they find themselves helping a survivors village deal with some ruthless bandits. The second group contains the doctor who is considered an expert on The Morningstar Virus. She is attempting to get to Omaha so she can work on a vaccine. Survivor groups one and two hope to meet up at the research facility in Omaha. The final set are sailors from the USS Ramage. They\u2019ve abandoned ship, and while exploring an abandoned town they find themselves in possession of a seriously hot commodity. Ok, I did it again. I read a series out of order. I didn\u2019t realize this was a sequel to another book. I saw zombies and thought Heck Yeah! Thankfully, reading this without reading the first turned out not to be a big deal. Background info was provided, and I pieced together what had occurred in book one, Plague of the Dead. The husband and I are both a little zombie obsessed. We have a group of friends who we\u2019ve planned our survival strategy with. Yes, we roll nerdy. So when I discover a new book starring the undead I have to read it. Thunder and Ashes portrayed the reanimated in a different light than I\u2019ve seen so far. You have two types, shamblers and sprinters. The names are pretty self-explanatory. Shamblers move slowly so you can usually get away. The sprinters are the scary ones. They can catch you. Once they\u2019ve let out their roar to alert other undead in the area you better make yourself scarce. They hunt like a pack. Zombies are scary, but the thought that they would be coordinated enough to actually hunt together and sprint after you is seriously unsettling. Kudos to the author for pointing out the virus is in the blood, and having character decontaminate themselves after a bloody battle with the undead. I hate when folks are out bludgeoning zombies in books or movies with little concern for blood splatter. Hello! Get some protective gear. Last thing you want is zombie blood or brain matter in your eye. Nice group of characters featured in this one. They could have been a little more developed. The pacing could have also been better. An extra 30 pages would have provided a meatier story, and maybe not such a rushed ending. Even with the minor flaws I was enthralled. This would make a fantastic movie. Seriously scary stuff, and if you\u2019re looking for something to make you sleep with the lights on this is it. I plan to backtrack and read the first book in this series. While I was researching the series further, I was sad to learn the author had passed away. A ghostwriter is working on finishing the third book in this series which is titled Survivors."}, {"userName": "Joel Lucasey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63505495-joel-lucasey", "userReview": "This book is a thrilling fantasy. The book is also a member of a good series. This book does not compare to any other book I read about this topic. This book has thrilling action and raids. It is zombie packed. This book has leaders but it is not based on their perspectives. It is talk between all the characters. They are human, and they face zombies and raiders. The setting is all over the United States, they are heading to a town, that is their objective. This book is mostly realistic. The zombies are the only way this is not realistic. I think other readers would enjoy this book because it is a thrilling zombie apocalypse with raiders and a common goal. I enjoyed this book because I'm a huge zombie fan. I think teenagers would like this book because when I was a kid I would have nightmares about zombies. The book didn't feel complete to me because there are several more books in this series. The raid was my favorite part of the book because it was a major action part. This book is worthwhile because it is full of a lot of main action parts. It would be a good addition for libraries and schools."}, {"userName": "Valentina Abate", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64456068-valentina-abate", "userReview": "This is absolutely one of the few sequel that don't let you down.
