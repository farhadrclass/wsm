I wrote an m/m Victorian Gothic fantasy. Well, someone had to. If you're wondering what's the deal with the magpies...British people count magpies. There's a rhyme everyone knows, of which the most common variant starts, 'One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy.' This book began its life when I pointed to three magpies in the park and told my daughter, 'Look, three for a girl,' and she said, 'But how did they know I'd be here?' Which got me thinking about what would happen if the magpies did know, and what magpie magic would entail, and what sort of things might happen to a man haunted by magic he didn't understand, and where he might turn for help. Because there are some fairly creepy magpie rhymes out there...One for sorrow Two for mirth Three for a wedding Four for a birth Five for rich Six for poor Seven for a witch, I can tell you no more.Eight for a babe buried in the earthNine for a feastingTen for a dearthI hope you enjoy it!

Historical is not my genre of choice; so any titles with historical tag will be low priority for me. However, I am a huge fan of mystery and paranormal. Contemplating the positive reviews and the fact that this story had paranormal mystery element, I decided to take the plunge.And what a delightful surprise it was...The story opened with Crane trying to commit suicide -- it wasn't because he wanted to do it, he was persuaded by force of evil. Merrick, Crane's manservant, told his Lord to look for help from a shaman. Entered Stephen Day, a magic practitioner who had every reasons to hate Crane for the sins of Crane's father. But Stephen realized that Crane was not his father and he ended up helping Crane to find out the root of evil that had almost took Crane's life.From the first page, I was immediately hooked. This story had PLOT people! It also had witty banters, engaging horror mystery infused with magic and tales and ghosts, BAMF!manservant (yes, you, Merrick!), captivating characters, and DELICIOUS sexual tension between the two men. The sex scenes were amazingly hot too. Crane and Stephen seemed to prefer NOT using beds! There prefer using vertical surface and one memorable desk (Oh, the story that desk can tell). They were RAWR-kind of scenes and it made me all melty and tingly and wanted to fan myself despite reading this in an centralized air-con room. The words, the words were pretty too; I was in love with it. And THAT climax of an ending, I wish ALL books end like that. I do have FEW trivial complaints:First, regarding the reveal of the bad guys. In mystery/suspense, I do love being surprised. However, at the same time, I would like to be 'guided' in the process. Throw in some clues and then red herrings along the way and I will be one happy girl when I come to the finish line. In here though, few of the major villains are disclosed in the 11th hour; without any prior introduction. It reduced the fun of deducing -- even if I wasn't a detective.Second, some of the teaser information is not fully explained in the end. We got the tease on Crane being \"forced to have a very large and expensive tattoo\". He was about to tell but he stopped and the issue wasn't raised again. It will be nice to have it told -- it will give me a deeper understanding about Crane and his background, similar to when Merrick told Mrs. Bell on why he was so loyal to Crane. We also got the cheeky tease of what happened with the champagne in China. But also never fully explained (I wanted to know!). Having said that, this is quite trivial because I assume we can still get the teasers explained in book #2.Third, this was definitely MY personal issue -- I could be annoying like that -- I wasn't too fond of Crane referring to Stephen as \"little man\". Maybe because Stephen and I shared the same height. It made me want to straighten up my spine, and defended my height to all you tall people!!So in conclusion: engaging, arousing, at times frightening, and most definitely entertaining. In the grand scheme of things, the minor complaints can't stop me from giving my rounded-up perfect 5-shining stars. Because this is what an excellent story is made-of -- a combination of well-prepared idea, well-plotted execution, and well-written characters. Simply one of my favorites from a debut author this year. I am definitely looking forward to book #2 coming in January.PS: Thanks for bringing this up to my timeline Vio (and others).

Magic.*sigh* love that song. And this book totally put me in the mood for it.But in context to this book, it's more like Magic, Sex...Love, maybe?I'm sure by now you've read and seen multiples of people losing their minds for this book. Body parts and fluids in awe of this book. Buzz, buzz buzz! The overtaking of everyone's news feeds, I secretly dubbed it Magpie-gate.When books are super popular, so soon since it's release and everyone lays 5 star reviews like free candy, I usually go:and plan on reading said buzz book later (months later if possible)But I was nudged to read this sooner. And I am so happy that I did.Cause it was really good. I'm a story girl. I'm not one to look for literary masterpieces because it just leads to disappointment. I love a good story, I like telling it, hearing it and reading it. \"The Magpie Lord\" is top notch. It's word porn, book crack, literary sugar with $10 words.My second favorite historical time period for romances: Victorian! (especially done well)K.J. Charles did a wonderful job tying in a paranormal/ magical edge to this time period. It's not typically a period one thinks of as sexy. But the story oozed sexual tension, fast paced twists and memorable characters. It was magical suspense meets Victorian England meets a secret world meets adventure meets man-on-man sexual intensity. And interesting world and magical culture building.I've read MF romances with big blonde haired sardonic rakehells that seduce all to get their way, verbally or sexually, makes no difference. I enjoy heroes like that. You can find one in Lucien, Lord Crane, the tradesman earl. Lucien embodies my favorite silver tongued hero. Plus he is a connoisseur of men and is unapologetic about it. Score!\u201cWhen I fuck you, Mr. Day, it will not be briefly. It will be long and hard and extremely thorough. I'm going to take pains with you.\u201dC'mon, that's a trouser dropper if I've ever read. I can not blame poor little ginger haired Stephen Day, magician not to be underestimated, for succumbing to the the Lucien steam. That man is lethal with his tongue.And Stephen?Adored him. I always root for the quiet MC's because they usually have something up their sleeves to surprise you. Stephen definitely did. And even when staring in the face of doom, he kept a clear head and faced his battles head on.Loved Stephen.Want Lucien.And to the author, for an excellent debut:I highly recommend. If you're on the fence, embrace this buzz book. It's actually worth the read.

You're a weird bunch of decapods, you know.So. I didn't DNF or hate the fish out of this book because:\u2460 It's a delightfully improbable mix of paranormal stuff, Victorian stuff, mystery stuff and M/M romance stuff. All things improbable are slightly awesome, ergo slightly awesome this book is \u2190 Logic is me, you say? Yes, I am well aware of the fact.\u2461 It's light but deliciously entertaining and fun and enjoyable and delectable and stuff. It's also fast-paced and there's magic and ghosts and villains, oh my! Okay, so the mystery isn't of the perplexingly baffling kind, and I'm sure my old pal Hercule would have solved it in less time it takes to say \"unleash the crustaceans, Fleet Admiral DaShrimp!\" BUT. One cannot read ALL profoundly deep material ALL the time. One has to let the little grey cells rest and relax once in a while and stuff. Otherwise they might viciously retaliate by going all \"we've had it! We're on bloody shrimping strike!\" on your ass pincers and stuff.

But this little book right here had me chuckling and giggling and snickering and cackling and chortling and guffawing and snorting in the most elegantly gleeful way. Yes it did. The Positively Edible Lord Crane (PELC\u2122) is exquisitely sarcastic and witty and funny and stuff. He jests and quips and gibes so lusciously it makes my pincers click uncontrollably. Not to mention the Outrageously Rambunctious Heating Effect (ORHE\u2122) his mere presence has on my exoskeleton. TPEMC\u2122 is a lord with the body and mouth of a sailor, you see. Hence lots of yummilicious swearing to be expected. And tattoos. Lots of, um, intriguing tattoos. And a hot body, too. But it's his titillating mind I'm in love with, undeniably. I couldn't care less about his physical appearance. Or the fact that he can get quite creative with desks, walls and rose gardens. And I certainly don't give a fish about his undying charm. Or his take no prisoners attitude towards flirtation. It's his brilliant intellect is what I'm lusting after here. So Poof, Gone, Harem (PGF\u2122) and stuff. Obviously. Sorry, what? Lord Crane is gay, you say? So what? I'm an equal opportunity kind of girl and I don't judge. I don't share, either. Not sorry, Tiny Stephen! Besides, I'm pretty sure he'll embrace his bisexuality with merriment the moment he meets me, so there. Problem solved and stuff.\u2463 No, I did not kill this book dead despite the Disgusting Romance of Doom and Oblivion (DRoDaO\u2122). No no no no no, my Little Barnacles! Lose consciousness on me again you shall not! We're done with the fainting epidemic, remember? Now get a grip and stop interrupting me, will you? So. Since finishing this book, I've been trying to figure out why to this romance wasn't quite as allergy-inducing as its colleagues. A fact that is most puzzling indeed, you have to admit.

It was a buddy read with my MacHalo ladies (surprise surprise). This year, we are doing themes for our books of the month and January was paranormal romance. The Magpie Lord was the winner.This book also fits one of the challenges in the 2018 Madcap MacHalo Fantabulous Bookish Challenge Extravaganza (MMFBCE\u2122): Mystery and Mischief. One down, eleven to go!The Magpie Lord is a paranormal mystery with romance. It\u2019s about a man named Crane (or Lord Crane, as he has recently inherited an earldom) and a justiciar named Stephen Day, who is basically a magician or mage or whatever you would like to call it.Someone is trying to kill Crane and they are using magic to do it. Dirty, dark magic. Warlocks.The story is about Crane and Day trying to figure out who is doing it and why and during the investigation, sparks fly. The romance is a rather slow burn, but there is a steamy scene towards the end! But it works quite well because who needs all that angst and lovey-dovey stuff, anyway?!The writing is great and set in a sort of slightly reimagined Victorian times, I believe. There are trains and such, but candles are still used for lighting.This isn\u2019t a very complex mystery, but I did enjoy the rather satanic warlocks and their grotesque methods of magicking. (What can I say, I like dark stuff.) I\u2019d like to find out more world-building about the ether and how the magic in this world works, but this was solid start to a series (and actually much better than a lot of \u201cfirst book in series\u201d books).Crane and Day are a great couple and complement each other well.

Not this time. I'd started The Magpie Lord months ago, but at the time had a little trouble connecting to the steampunk-ish chaos of the opening scene. And I hesitatingly admit that -- despite GOT's Tyrion sexy thing Lannister totally rocking his 4.5 ft -- discovering that one of the protagonists is a 5 ft scrawny shrimp didn't exactly help upping my excitement level. Then her HOT short story in the anthology Another Place In Time happened (all proceeds of this anthology are donated to AllOut.org! Please check it out if you haven't already! :). So of course I just HAD to give this book another chance....and got completely hooked on the amazing writing. And on the fact that when you'd strip away the M/M factor, the story would still hold its own. I realize that it's a little sad that I feel like mentioning this, but I do think that it's the gay guys that often save many otherwise mediocre writers. Anyway, I had such a blast simply enjoying the ride and the humorous and nifty writing, that the occasional bouts of heat flaring up, though neither plenty nor very lengthy, were more like the icing on the cake.

This story did all three.This is about a Victorian England in which the practice of magic and warlockery is an ominous undercurrent to life. Against this imaginative backdrop, the author brings together two wonderful MCs. Stephen Day is a magician, small in stature and unassuming in appearance, but powerful enough to take on warlocks and wreak justice upon them. Unless they turn out to be unusually strong... Lucien Vaudrey is now Lord Crane, an inheritance from his deceased loathed father, and subsequently deceased even more loathsome brother. After years in China, he intends to be back in England just long enough to wind up the affairs of his estate. Unfortunately, it appears that someone is trying to kill him by magic. And Stephen Day, his one hope of survival, is the son of a man ruined by Lucien's father. Lucien's dry wit is one of the joys of this book. There are so many great lines in his comebacks, with comments scathing or trenchant or self-mocking in wonderful ways. I would like to quote a dozen, but will refrain because they have the most impact in context. His manservant, Merrick, is a great foil for him. And Stephen is honorable and strong in most ways, and weak in some interesting ones. The sexual attraction between Lucien and Stephen smolders nicely, and occasionally flames, while their gradual meeting of the minds is satisfying. This book isn't perfect - for instance, I lost the action thread slightly in the climactic moments - but it is damned good. I'll buy the sequel as soon as it releases, and will happily reread this before plunging on in the adventures of these characters."}, {"userName": "\u2654 Jaela \u264a Killer \u2694 QUEEN ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16126654-jaela-killer-queen", "userReview": "Oh my God!

Amazing banter between both of the main characters, as well as the secondary characters.

This book has PLOT. Lots of it. Warlocks, earls, witches, power struggles, class, and more.Raise the church hands for sexuality not really being an issue in this book. In fact, the issue was often remarked on in amusing ways ie. the butler Graham commenting on wet trousers. RIDICULOUS UST.

This worked rather well. One absorbed the idea of a late Victorian world with magic, with many possible literary antecedents -- I'm thinking a cross between Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, Harry Potter deep background, and who knows what else (though perhaps not The Lustful Turk), but the summed effect seemed fresh to me. The plot stayed tightly focused on a limited cast and setting, which is pretty much what one wants for a romantic melodrama.I will likely end up reading more of these, just to see where it goes with the ideas and characters. The nice thing about adding suspense elements to a romance is that one can pull more than one plot out of a particular couple, rather than just person-gets-person, boom, done for all time.Ta, L.(The Lustful Turk, for those unacquainted, is a piece of real Victorian porn much discussed in the course of a hilarious mystery novel -- I think it was one of the Jacqueline Kirby series. Sorry I can't remember the title, because it -- the mystery, that is -- might be worth reccing, but I'm sure someone will chime in. The Victorian porn was passed around long ago amongst my circle of friends in the form of a tattered paperback, but I'm sure the new and less deprived generation will have it online somewhere.

The story is already magnificent and the narration made The Magpie Lord all the more magnificent. The Story: 5 Pants Off I really do love the heck out of this book. I am a fan of things creepy and a story filled with twists and turns and The Magpie Lord had it all. The characters are deeply rich, the storytelling topnotch, and the sexy time is definitely sexy. Lucien Vaudry aka Lord Crane on more than one occasion has tried to kill himself while deeply asleep and each time becoming more successful than the last. He knows he needs help and so he calls in local magician that comes highly recommend. Seems the title of Lord is deeply cursed which has Lucien feeling some sort of way because the sins of his father and brother shouldn\u2019t fall on him since he\u2019s been exiled for quite sometime. But in order to stay alive he will the need the help of Stephen Day, the tiny feisty magician who also hates his guts (sins of his father and all). What then transpires is next level creepy shit, ghosts of old, and magpies. Crane and Stephen clash in a most delicious type of way and they make the story all the more worthwhile. They got so much chemistry I was in flames. While I would call this a slow burn you won\u2019t mind cus it burns so good and it\u2019s quite delicious enjoying it for a second time. Let me also mention it\u2019s freaking hilarious. The greatest balance of creepy with hilariousity. The Narration by Cornell Collins: 4 Pants Off Yes, yes, and yes. Having read the book previously, listening to it brought a very different level of excitement. The narration was so on point, each character so very well developed in both uniqueness and personality. I am all for this and I\u2019m so much looking forward to listening the rest of the series.

These characters sold the book for me - they were multi dimensional and so real that I couldn't help but feel for every single one. Each character had an aspect that was going for them, be it humor, or malice or even tingling champagne hands. The author has without a doubt created a story that has a beautiful world, a beautiful plot, a beautiful theme and although it was not a character driven story - I couldn't help but feel the characters were the heart and soul of it. At par with the whole story-line. \u201cWas that Chinese for goodbye?\u201d Stephen asked. \u201cSee you again,\u201d Crane said. \u201cNot goodbye.\" Public Service Announcement: Frank Merrick has my heart. No refunds or exchanges. \nThe Vibes\n\"...or you can sit there and go mad for thinking you\u2019re going mad.\"I had some serious analytical and doctor who-sical vibes coming off from this.

I felt like the romance aspect lacked enough for me to wonder if the author intended it to be like that or if it was cut out in efforts for the focus to stay on other themes running through the story. Don't get me wrong, there was some hot and heavy man on man action - but I just wish it could have been more detailed, more build up, more getting to know each other. m.o.r.e\"He pushed his thumb further into the warm mouth and felt a flicker of tongue against his skin, a tentative taste.\"I loved The Magpie Lord to bits and I hate that it was so fucking close to being a 4 star!

This is a cracking good paranormal mystery set in Victorian England, with haunted mansions, sorcerers, snooty aristos, charming adventurers, and magpies\u2026 magpies everywhere!\u2026seven for a witch, I can tell you no more\u2026 Lord Crane, Lucien Vaudrey, is not your ordinary pampered aristocrat. He\u2019s had a rough twenty years but returns from exile in China, a self-made man, an opportunist, tattooed and hard-forged\u2026 and immune to the strict English dictates of his class. He enjoys his freedom, his privileges, and his men. He is a great main character.Crane finds upon his return home that he has more to manage than inherited money and property. There is the issue of his father and brother\u2019s alleged suicides, and now it seems that someone is intent on bringing harm to Crane\u2026 with the help of sorcery. He hires Stephen Day, a practitioner, a magician with expertise in ferreting out the nefarious forces at work against him.The scene is set mostly at Piper, Crane\u2019s gloomy country estate shrouded in some strange, malevolent force. The house is spooky, the servants are surly, and the grounds are populated by vast charms of magpies. In fact, this bird serves as the family symbol (hence the informal title, Magpie Lord) and given their reputation as an omen of ill fortune and connection to witchcraft, are fitting to the story. The paranormal phenomena are ghastly and graphic with more than enough inventive haunting and devilry, spell craft and things that go bump in the night to keep Crane and Stephen scrambling. The sexual tension between them is slow building and sizzling. While at first they seem incompatible, Crane is drawn to Stephen\u2019s goodness, his magic skills, his beautiful amber eyes, and those hands that make him shiver. It\u2019s fun to watch him seduce Stephen who is not initially a fan. Even with all the scariness, the connection and banter between them is infectious and humorous\u2026 \n\u201cWhat the fuck, what the fucking, bloody devil-shit, what in the name of Satan\u2019s swollen cock was that?\u201d \n-- Crane\n\u201cDo you speak in the House of Lords with that mouth?\u201d\n -- StephenThe story is well-paced and well-edited, the writing fluid and atmospheric.

I don't exactly hate it either, I'm between \"really meh\" and \"bored to tears\". I also do not at all and that is emphatically not at all, get the hype this book is getting.I'll be frank, please don't bite my head off!Firstly, it's a rip-off. It's a rather badly disguised concoction of:1. LaMont Cranston (Lucien and Crane? Even the same initials) is \"The Shadow\". Which used to be a pulp novel series in the 1930s, was then put on radio (Orson Welles cut his teeth on it), and then made a movie in the mid-nineties with a still very cute Alec Baldwin as Cranston. An American ex drug-lord, ex-junkie, ex-criminal, ex-smuggler chief of mafia-don standing, stationed somewhere close to or in China, who gets abducted by a \"tulku\" (shaman) and turned into a good person through magic.He learns to master the magic, can telepathically control people, is capable of superior physical feats, can telekinetically influence magical items, gets accosted in dreams, and fights crime in his home country America using the magical powers he was taught by the shaman (by the way, if you like Baldwin, watch the movie, it's quite lovely and dark, downright steampunkish, without being too gruesome).2. Batman, the early pulp and later Christian Bale versions, right along with a Merrick instead of an Alfred (Merrick is as good as exchangeable with Alfred), and a Stephen instead of a Robin. Batman by the way was very much influenced by the \"The Shadow\" novels...3, The Persuaders!, starring Roger Moore as Lord Brett Sinclair (toff English lord, blond, tall, very smart and self-assured) and Tony Curtis (American playboy of low origins and no sophistication, but quite capable of mayhem if needed). The series was characterised by a constant banter and classism between the protagonists. Which is rather identical with what takes place between Crane, Stephen and Merrick.Add some spoonfuls of Wooster and Jeeves, a bit of Lord Peter Wimsey, mix and stir, sprinkle some Harry Potter and Jane Austen on top, and there you have The Magpie Lord! Funnily many think this is a Sherlock/Watson derivate, now that I can't see at all. There's absolutely nothing of that dynamic in this book (except that both belong into the same era), but lots of the above-mentioned others instead.There is nothing really new, fresh or not regurgitated a few times in that story, plot-wise and characterise. That's not bad per se, all of us tell and re-tell the same stories just slightly differently, but to call this something \"original and rare\"? That's what all the 5-star reviews state. Okay, okay, maybe the state of m/m-writing is so dismal that anything halfway literate and having a plot might stand out, but truth be told, I don't grade against bad books, I grade against the better ones in a specific field. I also grade romances more or less together and there are lots of m/f romances around that I read during the past year or two which easily surpass this here.Secondly, this is a \"chick with a dick\" or seme/uke romance.Stephen is so very much the girl (or uke) in this pairing. Never mind his magical abilities, he lets loose a stream of consciousness which screams \"I'm a hapless swooning maiden! Rip my bodice! Rip my bodice!\" practically without interruption.Just imagine a 5' guy, described as so tiny and thin as to look like a schoolboy (!) beside one who is brawny, broad-shouldered and has 6'3\" in height! Just to put this into some relation--Michael J. Fox, who really comes over as tiny, has 5' 4\". Now place him beside Clint Eastwood, Liam Neeson or Kyle Secor. Ouch.And he is constantly on his knees, gets his red lips moistened and \"broken\" open by Crane, he is breathy, nearly faints half of the time, reacts like a Harlequin lady to Crane, is snippy, in the end gets f*cked like a girl (tried several times and f*cked in the end like that as well) and it's just not a femme who is described there. It's a \"male girl\".Plot-wise absolutely not needed. He could have been weakened by the prior fight without being reduced to looking like a child and be smaller than an average woman of the era.Heh, and trying to disguise a \"chick with a dick\" mishap by clothing it in some completely idiotic D/s allusion is truly the opposite of endearing me to a story. Every single sub or bottom I have ever come across had more \"male\" in their little finger than this Stephen all put together.Again, nothing unusual. So many m/m romances are nothing but m/f re-written into an m/m version. But people expressly maintain that this is a superior m/m novel, and that's where I scratch my head. To me an m/f story in disguise or seme/uke-dynamic sure as hell is not a shining sample of m/m.And lastly, the writing itself is nothing I would write home about. The prose is flowery, downright purple with such an insane amount of adverbs, adjectives and qualifiers thrown in, that I'm sure few nouns and verbs have escaped being modified. In fact, Charles is not satisfied with a single qualifier, she regularly uses two or three. The abundance of adverbs would make Stephen King have a shitfit and even I got antsy over them.There was a load of melodrama, I can't say either that I detected any UST, or anything erotic. I'm not at all into tattoos (so they didn't move me any which way), and magic lube is, heh, tacky. The blow-job was described in a to me unerotic, turning-off manner and throwing \"the little man\" over desks or against trees is sort of, well, unsexy and so reminding me of bodice ripping. The final act was a rip-off of \"Wallbanger\" (that's the het romance I'm talking about).So, this is not meant as a take-down of those who like this book.It IS a solidly written piece of fluff and entertainment. Like a well-made blockbuster summer movie, a lot of very hot air. But it has no real depth, no real elegance. I get it that it is something people can like and squee over, but it's nowhere close to the hype it is getting. And I bought in to the hype, so now I judge going by it. I can't help that.If I had thought this is just some fluffy inconsequential fantasy, I might have been less disappointed. I expected much, much more after reading all these reviews.I most identify with Crispy's review, he or she nails it:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...I loved the cover by the way, though both it and the blurb are extremely misleading. They make one expect some sort of Victorian steampunk or gaslight tale, but in all reality nothing in this novel even suggests historical accuracy.

I feel fish out of water (why do they jump out of the tank, anyway?).When someone tries to sell a product, the merchant rambles about all the virtues and advantages of his product and the client is the one who decides if his time listening to all that verbal diarrhea is worth it or not. The client hears the first sentences, something calls his attention and the peddler goes on with his monologue. If he is a good peddler, he manages to turn it into a dialogue and makes the client participate in the discussion. If he is convinced, the client decides the product is good and buys it. The seller gets money and the client gets a shining new thing. But if the seller is boring it can be hell listening to him and you ignore it. But it can happen something outstanding, like seeing lots of people buying the shining new things so you stop and listen. The more time that passes, the more bored you are, but that person keeps selling them like hot cakes. So you begin having doubts, maybe there is a catch you are not getting, maybe you are missing something serious and honestly phenomenal you are not able to see. So go stay, listening like a dumb, hoping the bulb on your head miraculously lightens. In the end, you have swallowed all the paraphernalia with no benefit at all.After the spell is broken you wonder, why did I waste my time like that? The answer was there since the very beginning, I was just not interested! I just didn't the seller nor the product!The style never drew me in. I felt a distance from the characters I usually feel while reading an all time classic novel. It was as if the author didn't invest herself in the novel, as if she were manipulating her characters with long invisible threads instead of living inside their skin.I don't like that feeling.The thing is, I really appreciate the quality and originality of the book but wasn't hooked by the writing or the fantasy wows. I liked the world building but it didn't amaze me. I liked the characters but couldn't feel any affinity for them. I liked the plot but couldn't be less interested in the events. I appreciated it all from an almost scientific perspective, but didn't feel any warmth or heart in it. Zero chemistry. And I even found some inconsistencies and incoherences. And I was immensely bored.There is no recipe that works 100%. You can't ask me what ingredients should a book have to make it awesome. It's the way they are combined and cooked and the I-don't-know-what that makes it for me or not.

Now I've got my reading mojo back and happened to see a comment about this book on my status feed. I followed the link, decided to give the book a go, and couldn't put it down. This book would have totally passed me by and that would have been a great shame.The Magpie Lord has everything I look for in a great m/m romance. There's intelligent, compelling writing coupled with characters who stand out from the page and an exciting, chilling story of magical misuse. The Victorian setting seemed perfectly realised with enough detail for the setting to seem natural without overegging it. From the start I was drawn in by the seemingly opposite Lord Lucien and the 'practitioner' Stephen. They are both strong characters but in subtly different ways that complement each other. The story is non stop, full of tense action scenes mixed with character development and a simmering sexual tension that curled my toes. The secondary characters, especially loyal Merrick who is more like a friend than a manservant to Lucien, contain enough complexity to be interesting. My only disappointment was that the main villains' motive seemed lacking when everything has been so carefully built up and explained, although I'm hoping more will be developed in future books.Overall, I can't recommend this highly enough for those readers who like paranormal historical romance.
