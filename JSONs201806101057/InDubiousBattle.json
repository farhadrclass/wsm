These same themes would later be explored in Steinbeck\u2019s seminal work The Grapes of Wrath (published in 1939 and winning the National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize \u2013 and Steinbeck would go on to win the Nobel Prize in 1962).In a style reminiscent of his work Of Mice and Men (as well as Jack London\u2019s writing due to the theme) Steinbeck tells the story of Jim Nolan, a young and impressionable man who has committed himself to a socialist of communist party to take part in a labor strike between apple pickers and the growers association. Mentored (and used ) by veteran labor activist Mac McLeod, Jim learns the fundamentals of labor organization and also learns, the hard way, about society\u2019s reactions to and against such activities.Told with sympathy towards labor movements and the nobility of the common man, Steinbeck remains objective and also provides some stern criticisms for socialism as well, especially in regard to practices that are no better than the capitalists they fight.Using strong, powerful language, Steinbeck describes the enforcers of the establishment:\u201cthey\u2019re the dirtiest guys in any town. They\u2019re the same ones that burned the houses of old German people during the war. They\u2019re the same ones who like to lynch Negroes. They like to be cruel. They like to hurt people, and they always give it a nice name, like patriotism, or protecting the constitution.\u201dSimply told, with languages and images that are evocative, and with a message that is timeless, In Dubious Battle is one of Steinbeck\u2019s lesser known, but more serious works."}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "At a time when the divide in this country between rich and poor is as great as it's ever been, a book like In Dubious Battle becomes quite pertinent once more.It's the Great Depression and the Red Scare has the nation suspicious of anyone who might organize a strike for better wages, for something higher than the starvation-level pay the bosses are handing out to hard-up fieldworkers. Steinbeck's In Dubious Battle follows Jim, a newcomer to the Communist Party. Mac, a strike agitator takes him under his wing and off they go to a California apple valley, where the bosses have cut wages. Here they meet a number of different individuals who represent the various sides of the conflict. Steinbeck's character development is quite impressive here, considering he constructed an ensemble cast and breathed life into each of them, so that they all appear almost real and not just two dimensional caricatures. And while the author originally set out to write a non-fiction account of a workers' strike, he has succeeded in portraying this as an utterly believable fiction that does not drag due to political agenda proselytizing.While Steinbeck is for the working man, his sympathies do not make him entirely blind to the failings of the \"radical left\". He does question why, when man rules the Earth, would man subject man to a sub-subsistence existence? Why not share the wealth? Well, Steinbeck points to the lazy, shiftless who prefer to shirk duty and steal to get by rather than do their fair share. And then there's the greedy need in some men to rule, to gather up all the wealth and power they can for their own selfish desire. There it is again, those extremists who go screwing it up again for the rest of stuck in the middle."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4542979-kim", "userReview": "Writing novels about the poor and dispossessed in 1930s California and in the process attracting the wrath of farmers\u2019 organisations and the attention of the FBI gave John Steinbeck a reputation which has persisted to this day. Many people assume that he was a communist, or at the very least a socialist. This novel, along with The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men is a work which cemented Steinbeck\u2019s reputation in that regard. However, the characterization of Steinbeck\u2019s politics as socialist or communist is incorrect. While he had a passion for supporting the underdog, he wasn\u2019t any further to the left politically than New Deal Democrat. Steinbeck was, if anything, disparaging about communists, commenting in a letter to a friend shortly after this novel was published:  I don\u2019t like communists either. I mean I dislike them as people. I rather imagine the apostles had the same waspish qualities and the New Testament is proof that they had equally bad manners. The plot of this novel - Steinbeck\u2019s fifth - focuses on fruit growers in a fictional valley in California. Two \u201cParty\u201d (presumably Communist Party) activists \u2013 the seasoned campaigner Mac MacLeod and his young apprentice Jim Nolan \u2013 infiltrate a group of itinerant fruit pickers with the intention of provoking a strike and violent confrontation with the growers. From the beginning Mac is aware that the strategy is doomed to failure because of the superior resources of the growers. However, he doesn\u2019t hesitate to manipulate the fruit pickers and to use whatever means at his disposal to achieve the Party\u2019s objectives. The novel works on a number of levels. At its simplest level, it analyses the process of manipulating a group of people to achieve a political end. However, it\u2019s also an exploration of one of Steinbeck\u2019s favourite themes \u2013 group behaviour and the way in which it differs from the behaviour of individuals. The novel also functions as Jim Nolan\u2019s bildungsroman, the psychological portrait of a young man moving from disaffection to self-knowledge as he discovers his skills and strengths. Unusually for Steinbeck, the novel contains relatively little description of the natural world. Instead, most of the action is contained in dialogue. However, even with the absence of descriptive language, there is a cinematic quality to the narrative. I could picture scenes in the novel as scenes from a film \u2013 detailed, vivid and striking. The characters are also striking with a solidity and reality I\u2019ve come to expect from Steinbeck\u2019s writing. Writing a novel like The Grapes of Wrath meant that everything else Steinbeck wrote either before or after was going to be compared to it. That was a burden for Steinbeck as it would be for any writer. Given the subject matter of this novel, the comparison with The Grapes of Wrath is even more inevitable. That\u2019s a shame, because this work has its own power. And according to Wikipedia it\u2019s Barack Obama\u2019s favourite Steinbeck novel, which may well be another reason to read it, should a reason be required."}, {"userName": "Mahdi Lotfi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52374183-mahdi-lotfi", "userReview": "\u062f\u0631 \u0646\u0628\u0631\u062f\u06cc \u0645\u0634\u06a9\u0648\u06a9 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u06cc\u0647 \u0638\u0644\u0645 \u0637\u0628\u0642\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u06cc \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0645\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0632\u0647 \u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f . \u062c\u06cc\u0645 \u0627\u0632 \u06af\u0630\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u0627\u0634 \u062e\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062c\u0645\u0646 \u0645\u06cc \u067e\u06cc\u0648\u0646\u062f\u062f \u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u06af\u0648\u0634\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u06a9\u0634\u0648\u0631 \u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642 \u0633\u06cc\u0628 \u0686\u06cc\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0645 \u0634\u062f\u0647 . \u062c\u06cc\u0645 \u0648 \u0645\u06a9 \u0628\u0647 \u0622\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u0645\u06cc \u0631\u0648\u0646\u062f \u062a\u0627 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0628 \u0631\u0627 \u0631\u0647\u0628\u0631\u06cc \u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f. \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0647 \u0641\u0642\u0637 \u06cc\u06a9 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u0628\u062e\u0634\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0627\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0628\u0644\u06a9\u0647 \u0631\u0627\u0647\u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0647\u0645\u0647 \u0641\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0639\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u0645\u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0641\u0639\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u062a \u0627\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0639\u06cc \u0686\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u062a\u0635\u0648\u06cc\u0631 \u0622\u0645\u062f\u0647 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0627 \u06cc\u06a9 \u062c\u0632\u0648\u0647 \u0622\u0645\u0648\u0632\u0634\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0631\u06cc \u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u0646\u062f. \u0645\u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631\u0627\u062a\u06cc \u0647\u0645\u0686\u0648\u0646 \u0647\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u0646\u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u06a9\u0633\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc \u062c\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u062f\u0646\u062f. \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u0631\u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u0646\u0628\u0631\u062f\u06cc \u0645\u0634\u06a9\u0648\u06a9 \u0646\u0627\u0645 \u06af\u0631\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "Perfectly titled. All American workers, the common men, are caught between Communists & Capitalists. Only one sentence in the book speaks for the Capitalists, the market price of apples has gone down, thus the migrant pickers wages are lower when they arrive than they expected. Already on the bitter edge, the migrant workers are at the mercy of the growers, the Capitalists, unless they can band together to be a force to be reckoned with which makes them ripe picking for the Communists.Jim, a new recruit for the 'Reds', wades into this maelstrom with all the good intentions in the world. He sees the workers' plight, fights for them, & wants to do more. Learning from Mack, he soon outstrips his mentor. Along the way, a lot of people get hurt, but he keeps his eye on the Big Picture.It's a perfect book for the times in which we live where everyone is talking about the 1%, the imbalance between the haves & the have nots. On the surface, the book seems to espouse the cause of Communism, but there is a lot unsaid & a rather ugly subtext. Very little sympathy is wasted on anyone who has anything no matter how hard they worked for it.The Reds don't really care what they have to do to create conditions for their revolution. It doesn't matter how poorly they use anyone nor who they hurt so long as the Cause goes forward. The Capitalists don't care about the workers so long as their apples get picked, but that's as true of the little guys as it is the bigger ones. The workers just want to be able to eat, but are often nothing save a fickle mob mentality easily swayed by whoever has the last say. Most are more worried about their next meal than the future. It was ugly & so true, a truly dubious battle.The characters were great & spoke volumes. There was a lot of dialogue that described the scene far better than I would have expected. I liked that method better than plain narration. Best of all, the book made me think a lot. I'm still thinking about it & will for ages. Highly recommended.PS - English Teachers, please consider this as a reading assignment rather than The Red Pony, the worst book by Steinbeck that I was forced to read 3 times in school. It SUCKS. I was turned off Steinbeck for decades. If my own son hadn't read Of Mice and Men & badgered me into reading it, I never would have read another of his novels & would have missed out on so much."}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9822645-jon", "userReview": "In Dubious Battle is the first of Steinbeck\u2019s three Dust Bowl novels, with Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath being the other two. While all three books amply display Steinbeck\u2019s profound empathy for those who are marginalized and disenfranchised, In Dubious Battle is arguably the more overtly political of the three books. As the book opens, one of the main characters, Jim Nolan, joins the Communist Party. For his first assignment, Nolan is sent with Mac, one of the Party\u2019s veteran labor organizers, to help foment a strike among migratory fruit pickers in a small California valley. When the pickers arrived in the valley for the yearly harvest, the Grower\u2019s Association announced that their wages would be dramatically reduced, creating the perfect conditions for the organizers to capitalize on the residual anger of the pickers and strike a blow for economic equality. The book follows their efforts to get the strike off the ground and Jim\u2019s growth as an organizer as he learns from his more experienced partner.While both Mac and Jim are often sympathetic, the book is far from a love letter to the Communist Party. Mac is ruthless and, in his own way, as equally manipulative of the workers as the Grower\u2019s Association is. To Mac, the workers are merely a means to an end and the potential suffering that the strike might inflict upon them doesn\u2019t even merit consideration. In fact, he fervently hopes that things will turn bad:\u201cThere's the bulk of power in the hands of a few men. That always makes 'em cocky. Now we start our strike, and Torgas County gets itself an ordinance that makes congregation unlawful. Now what happens? We congregate the men. A bunch of sheriff's men try to push them around, and that starts a fight. There's nothing like a fight to cement the men together. Well, then the owners start a vigilantes committee, bunch of fool shoe clerks, or my friends the American Legion boys trying to pretend they aren't middle-aged, cinching in their belts to hide their pat-bellies- they I go again. Well, the vigilantes start shooting. If they knock over some of the tramps we have a public funeral; and after that, we get some real action. Maybe they have to call out the troops. Jesus, man! The troops win, all right! But every time a guardsman jabs a fruit tramp with a bayonet a thousand men all over the country come on our side. Christ Almighty! If we can only get the troops called out\u201dif the strike succeeds and the growers capitulate, it will be a small victory, but Mac and Jim really don't want a small victory. Instead, a spectacular failure serves their cause better. This complexity is one of the book's strengths. Steinbeck isn't content to write a simple story of good versus evil and while Mac and Jim support workers in general, they see nothing wrong with exploiting and manipulating these workers to acheive their goals. Throughout the book, Steinbeck also offers a crash course in mob mentality as the fruit pickers are eventually coaxed and manipulated into staging their strike and then to keep their resolve up in the face of inevitable pushback from the growers and local authorities. Sprinkled throughout the book are philosophical arguments between the two organizers and one of their helpers, Doc Burton, a man sympathetic to their goals but distrustful of their methods. In Burton\u2019s opinion the end doesn\u2019t justify the means, instead, the means determines the end:\u201cThe end is never very different in its nature from the means\u2026you can only build a violent thing with violence\u2026It seems to me that man has engaged in a blind and fearful struggle of a past he can\u2019t understand, into a future he can\u2019t forsee nor understand\u201dMac and Jim\u2019s goal is to use the strike as a means to bring together countless other exploited workers across the country. The ultimate goal of which is to destroy the capitalistic system that is oppressing them. That the battle will be lost is foreshadowed with the quote that opens the book. The title is a quote from Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost. In it, Satan describes his attempt to overthrow God :\"Innumerable force of Spirits armed, That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring, His utmost power with adverse power opposedIn dubious battle on the plains of HeavenAnd shook his throne. What though the field be lost?\"The book does have some weaknesses, with the lack of strong female characters being the most glaring. While there are plenty of women in the book, most of them are non-entities that aren\u2019t even given the benefit of a name. The one female character that Steinbeck spends any time on is portrayed rather negatively and isn\u2019t particularly bright. Still, while it doesn\u2019t rise to the level of Steinbeck\u2019s best work, the book is worth reading and contains some of Steinbeck\u2019s classic themes."}, {"userName": "Christopher", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher", "userReview": "[Editor: For unexpressed reasons, the author of this review has requested with utmost fervency that the reader watch this YouTube video before continuing to read and then imagine its main subject, Dr. Steve Brule, reading the body of the review aloud as a monologue.]This was a very good book. It displays all the hallmarks of Steinbeck's greatest writing: wonderful dialogue and characterization, heartbreaking turns of plot, and the permeating sense of optimistic pessimism*. The problem that this book runs into is that its author went on to write a book you may have heard of: the towering, hulking Great American Novel known as The Grapes of Wrath, in the shadow of which In Dubious Battle humbly resides. In every way possible, this book feels like a practice run for The Grapes of Wrath.This is the first book in what some call Steinbeck's Dust Bowl Trilogy. In Dubious Battle, Of Mice and Men, The Grapes of Wrath. Where Of Mice and Men tells a mostly nonpolitical, simple, perfect little story, In Dubious Battle and The Grapes of Wrath tell essentially the same story. They examine the fates of migrant workers fleeing the desolation of the Dust Bowl who find themselves entangled in a battle with the powers that be.My recommendation: if you haven't read The Grapes of Wrath, go read it, ya dummy! If you have, go read Steinbeck's other books.

This novel is also the one that Steinbeck fans often \"forget\" about. Its tale of the struggles between a party organizer and the agricultural \"system\" doesn't fit well with reader's depiction of good and bad sides. While Steinbeck identifies with the worker and the union organizers, he also recognizes the fact that each side manipulates and sacrifices often in a cynical way. Much of the novel relates this view through dialogues between Jim, the new volunteer in the party and Mac, a long time organizer who knows reality all too well.

I read it for one of my English classes this semester, and I think the subject matter of the class (\"Race, Ethnicity, Gender in American Lit. and Film\") definitely influenced my perspective when reading this novel. I grew annoyed with the lifelessness of the female characters in the story--when they ARE presented, they're dull, one-dimensional mothers or daughters or caretakers, and it's just so unoriginal. Because the story takes place during the Industrial Revolution, the absence of female laborers really struck me. Additionally, Steinbeck was known to do extensive research before writing his novels, so the lack of historical accuracy, with respect to women's critical presence in the work-force during the Industrial Revolution, was a bit unbelievable. Then again, I try not to judge white, early 20th century American authors too harshly because they're a product of their time; we all are.That aside, the overall plot and theme is very interesting. I want to give Steinbeck credit for what I did like. It shows the way in which power can corrupt, even when those in power are fighting against even more powerful people. Mac, the head of The Party, is an example of this corruption, having used his authority to further The Party's agenda, with little regard for the lives that may be lost on that journey. Jim's character (the protagonist) serves as a symbol of the raw material that those in power utilize, with little/no personal regard, to gain more power. The ending is very solemn and thought-provoking. I do think this novel is worth reading, especially if you're a Steinbeck fan, as it provides some elements of classic Steinbeck (working-class struggle) and presents interesting questions and perspectives; it's good food for thought."}, {"userName": "Adriana", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19175593-adriana", "userReview": "Desi inrudit cu Soareci si oameni prin tematica abordata, acest roman nu e la fel de puternic.

'In Dubious Battle' was Steinbeck's first novel after his breakthrough 'Tortilla Flat'. However, while this breakthrough was a relatively easy going book, very much in keeping with the future classic 'Cannery Row', 'In Dubious Battle' tackles more serious subject matter, portraying an apple pickers' strike orchestrated by 'the Party' (which party is never made clear)in a Californian valley.The main action of the novel is held together by the following of Jim Nolan, a new member of the party, whose father was legendary in 'red' circles, and who becomes active under the mentorship of Mac, an experienced strike organiser, as they seek to organise the apple pickers in their fight for better terms from the farmers whose crops they are picking. Initially, one feels sympathetic for the workers' cause, but as the book progresses, while the injustice of the poor conditions suffered by the workers is clear, the actions of the strikers, led by London but manipulated by Mac and Jim becomes increasingly ugly, and ultimately results in a tragic finale.I absolutely loved this novel, as I have done the majority of the Steinbeck works I have read. In this narrative he writes simply yet vividly, and does a great job in guiding the readers' feelings about the strike, and no doubt the industrial unrest at the time, by commenting on the strike and its ideology through the impartial character of Doc Burton. It sets the pattern for the later and more widely read 'Grapes of Wrath', and is a book that I'd recommend highly to everyone!"}, {"userName": "Tarcinlikurabiye", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63903046-tarcinlikurabiye", "userReview": "Steinbeck, insanl\u0131\u011f\u0131n kapitalist sistemle ve en \u00e7ok da kendisiyle etti\u011fi o bitmeyen kavgas\u0131n\u0131 anlat\u0131yor.

Mac and Jim, the activists, go along to the dispute, which was caused by a cut in wages and they try to organise the workers to become united in the face of the employers offensive against them. All the workers have is their unity and 'class consciousness' (however shaky that actually is) in the face of intimidation and repeated attempts to break the strike by the equally organised County employers, who use law-enforcement to try and control the dispute, along with vigilantes who use much more questionable methods to try and break the strike (arson and murder essentially). The employers use every available means to crush the dispute, such as intimidation of supporters, the press, as well as limiting the strikers access to food and so on. The main purpose I believe of In Dubious Battle, is showing how far the agitators would go to win; Jim, the younger of the two, has great idealistic notions about standing up for the 'workers', and this is his first dispute he has taken part in, whilst Mac, a veteran activist is a lot more harder and jaded. Then there is the Doctor who is a sympathiser but not a Communist, having disagreements with the methods and means that the Communist Party activists use. Do the 'ends justify the means', I believe is one of the main tenets of the novel, and whilst you begin to have great sympathy with the plight of the migrant workers in the face of nasty intimidation, hunger, demoralisation and dissent within their own ranks etc, the methods employed by the CP members sometimes are equally questionable too, such as using the shooting of a striker to 'rouse' up the workers. The conversations between Mac, Jim and the Doctor deal with this central theme: How far would you go to win? What is acceptable to gain the end result? And so on. The conclusion is forgone. There is no way the strikers could win in the face of organised hostility from the employers and what power they could wield (State Law Enforcement with guns and tear gas vs clubs and fists is not a winning formula), and despite holding on to the last, the strike quite tragically ends with the murder of Jim (I assume his martyrdom had some effect, but the book ends at that point), but as Mac states throughout the book, many strikes he had been involved in were lost, but all were remembered. I found the book an interesting insight into post-depression USA, and just how tough you had to be to be a Union Organiser as well as a Communist during the 1930s America. A good read. Of note, there was a film released last year (2017) based on this novel; I never knew and it is on my 'to watch' list now."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23841736-sarah", "userReview": "No more lone cries came from lone men.

I had read \"Grapes of Wrath\" and \"Mice and Men\" in school and then never thought of him until Oprah made \"East of Eden\" a book club selection and I fell in love with Steinbeck. This novel takes place in the 1930's in the Central Valley of Calif. and concerns a strike among fruit pickers for more money. Although the strike is about apple pickers, Warren French who wrote the introduction, says it's based on a peach picker strike in Tulare County. That part makes little difference. The story made me think of my maternal grandfather who was an almond rancher in the Northern Central Valley and I think probably had experiences similar to the people in the book. Fruit pickers are really the bottom of the barrel jobs and tend to go to recent immigrants. In the book, the workers are Italians and Irish. As they assimilate the workers became Hispanic and now many are Vietnamese and Hmong. As they are new to the country they seem to have lower expectations of proper working conditions which makes it easier to prey on. But there's a point where people break and decide it's just not right. This is what happens. Pushed and prodded they decide to strike. A \"party\" organizer, Mac shows up with his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Jim Nolan, and start to create situations that make people want to strike. He seems to have a masterful use of mass psychology and no expectations of actually winning the strike. He has no problem with the havoc he causes in people's lives. A business owner is burned out for helping him, another's farm is destroyed and others lose everything they have in the world just to fuel Mac's fierce determination and a losing cause. French says it's a dubious battle because it shouldn't have happened and Steinbeck was trying to call for an end of man's inhumanity to man. This is where I dropped my rating a 1/2 star because I'm not sure that it shouldn't have happened. It was the strikes by Caesar Chavez that brought better conditions for agriculture workers. I think there becomes a point when people just can't take their situation anymore and take a stand. I think that's what happened to Rosa Parks. One day it was just enough. The book was also quite interesting on mob psychology. Mac knew how to whip a crowd around and how to develop a man's thirst for blood. It was quite evident how lynch mobs occur. That's a story that goes on today. Overall, this was a fantastic book that really makes you think. It's still so relevant today when people are faced with dubious battles. People still tilt at windmills and even facing certain defeat, they make a stand. Aren't they the real heroes?"}, {"userName": "Brent Ecenbarger", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1390208-brent-ecenbarger", "userReview": "\"In Dubious Battle\" is a great book, one that is sure to make you angry and sad while reading it. Steinbeck does a great job of showing both sides of the labor battle, while making one side as good and the other as bad, but still showing both sides to be manipulative. The book follows the character of Jim along, as he joins the \"party\" and eventually accompanies Mac into apple picking country to organize a strike. The bulk of the book's philosophy is expunged in conversations between Jim, Mac, and Dr. Burton.Steinbeck takes a sociological perspective of labor unions, specifically at mob mentality. This borders on ecological, as man is described as an animal that does not always understand what he does, or can control it, nor predict it. Steinbeck is a master at portraying the common man, and keeping the book exciting even when you can guess how it will play out."}, {"userName": "Buddy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2015612-buddy", "userReview": "I realized a little way in that I had read this before.

I read it now for a reading group and must say, it is a much better book than The Grapes of Wrath.All of the qualities I love best about Steinbeck are here. Great complex characters, description that brings the locations and the weather and the events to life, and a thoughtful look at a big human problem.The trouble with trying to help a person or specific group with a problem is that the helper is not the person or a member of the group. The main characters from \"the party\" (Steinbeck does not call them communists but the growers do) come in from the outside. They are desperate characters for their own reasons but they are not migrant workers and their agenda stems from a political consciousness.Steinbeck gives a brilliant exposition of the methods used to organize downtrodden workers into people who will fight the system: finding or even creating an incident that will ignite them out of apathy, the \"end justifies the means\" mentality, and the justifications for violence and criminal activity. It has been ever thus when the dregs or unfortunates rise up.He shows all of it, making his book still vital today.

I managed to avoid reading most American and British classic lit during high school and college. While this isn't Steinbeck's best known work, it should rank among his best. He tells the story of a labor dispute in an agricultural community in California. This novel was written in the 1930's and the Great Depression had it's hold over the US until the late 1930's and in some places into the 1940's. Agricultural workers at the time were white men who lived on the margins of society. The two main characters in the book are radicals, and I surmised the Party they constantly mentioned was the Communist Party. The story centers on the strike and the dynamics of power in the hands of a few local big growers, reduced wages for people with few other options for work, and questions of how to fight the big guys and if the \"little\" guy can win.

Back in PBT days (circa 2004), I used to write little snippet reviews for every book I read but since I started using GR last summer, I've been so impressed by the high caliber of Quinten's reviews that I've been too intimidated to write my own. And lazy. But I'm going to start anyway.In Dubious Battle completes my run of all of the Steinbeck books at the Central Library, and certainly ends it on a high note. When I first added this book as \"to-read,\" I was somewhat dismayed that the average GR rating didn't seem that high (a fraction under 4). So I was pleasantly surprised by how immediate and engaging it turned out to be. Whereas I felt like I had to slog through Tortilla Flat (which immediately preceded this book in publication) and The Grapes of Wrath (three books later in the migrant workers series) , the relatively fast-paced plot and action in this one made it practically a page-turner. If this were a preview for a summer blockbuster, the deep male announcer voice would say \"GRIPPING.\" It's certainly an enormous improvement from Tortilla Flat's flat characters and aimless meandering.Of course, the introduction was terribly dry and dull as almost all introductions to Steinbeck novels are for some reason.

It's Steinbeck's first full-length novel considering the others up to this point are more like novellas. What I enjoyed about this one is that Steinbeck's straightforward storytelling ability shines through. He doesn't do anything fancy but his writing is effective. The novel is easy to get into and each scene is crystal clear. It's one of those that I imagined could be made into a film, which I found out it was in 2016 directed by James Franco. It's fast-paced for Steinbeck standards, has a distinct atmosphere, and has enough memorable scenes to translate to the big screen. Of Mice and Men features these same characteristics. In Dubious Battle takes place during the dust bowl and is bolstered by two male leads, also in line with Of Mice and Men. I wonder if aspects of In Dubious Battle inspired Of Mice and Men considering all the factors that align so closely. It also generates an emotional response from the reader, one of anger and frustration, which builds throughout. I would argue it's his first book that successfully generates these emotions in a serious, non-satirical manner. It's almost like witnessing him discover this sweet spot that readers adore in his later work. In Dubious Battle also differs from his other books up to this point because it has a political side to it in which he addresses communism in a multitude of ways. This is symbolized through the story rather than adding a separate political dialogue, so I didn't find it to be invasive. The story is about a group of orchard pickers who go on strike and seek other's to fight for their cause. It doesn't sound all that exciting, but trust me when I say this -- things happen. I thought it was enjoyable but I doubt it will remain in my mind for years to come.

Told from the perspective of capitalist-hating men sympathetic to \"red Russia\", trying to fight a battle they might not be able to win. I imagine this book was very unpopular at the time, maybe seen as anti-American, but I don't think that's the point of the story, I think the point is that people are desperate, are apt to follow pack mentality and quick to justify violence and murder in the name of a greater cause and purpose. So who is the villain? Capitalism is not a person, it's an idea. Socialism is not a person either, and even today is seen as the villain, but socialism is not a human person and so can only be a construct or a philosophy. The reader followed the story from the view point of the men on strike, fighting for fair wages against men portrayed as colluding capitalists with big government on their side. Police are portrayed as siding with the land owners and business people, laws are depicted as benefiting the wealthy and hurting the working man, and honestly, that may be true, but I don't believe the social dynamic of this story is only black or white, it is instead somewhere in the middle. From the times of land owning aristocracy, to social changes transpired trough mercantilism, industrialism until the modern age, there have always been examples of human deceit, social injustice and suffering. Humans can be savage, especially when fighting for our families or our communities. Recall back to Steinbeck's other stories, the family is a central figure in every story, and that's true for many today. Even when our definition of \"family\" is more broad than the nuclear father/mother and single household construct, and encompasses friends, work, community, country, religion, politics, sex, pain, pleasure, people show a pattern of craving belonging, crying for mercy and demanding justice."}, {"userName": "Todd", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1565415-todd", "userReview": "As always, I love Steinbeck's voice and style.. I also loved that he dropped the F- bomb in this novel.It reminded me of \u00c9mile Zola's 'Germinal', and Upton Sinclair's 'The Jungle'.. both great novels about the struggles of the working class. We've gained a lot from work strikers and unions. They fought many a hard battle for equality in the workforce.I feel pretty spoiled (after reading this book) in our current economy, so it's nice to have these novels to put things in perspective."}], "description": "At once a relentlessly fast-paced, admirably observed novel of social unrest and the story of a young man's struggle for identity, \"In Dubious Battle\" is set in the California apple country, where a strike by migrant workers against rapacious landowners spirals out of control, as principled defiance metamorphoses into blind fanatacism. Caught up in this upheaval is Jim Nolan, a once aimless man who finds himself in the course of the strike, briefly becomes its leader, and is ultimately crushed in its service.", "title": "In Dubious Battle", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1293651.In_Dubious_Battle", "average": 3.88, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1419188044l/1293651.jpg", "reviews": 598, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/585.John_Steinbeck", "name": "John Steinbeck"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/84484.Warren_G_French", "name": "Warren G.
