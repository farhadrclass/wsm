It seems that everyone Tricia Patterson knows is getting married. Dreading the upcoming summer wedding season with 6 invites already in hand, Tricia and her best friend Sean agree to attend all of them as a couple. That should help keep everyone from giving them the \"so sad you're still single\" looks! That plan goes up in smoke when Sean is involved in an accident that leaves him hospitalized and out of the country. Luckily for Tricia, Sean's brother Ryan agrees to stand in for Sean for all the weddings.

Also, wished I knew beforehand that this was clean. The fade-to-black moments were such a bummer. I liked the heroine and thought she made a lot of sense throughout the story. The other characters, not so much. Her best guy friend sounded very much like a girl friend to me, and young to boot. I also was a bit iffy about the romance between the hero/heroine. I knew they'd hook up, but why was a mystery. They didn't seem particularly interested in each other before the hookup.

It really was bloody ridiculous.So basically this book is about this girl Tricia who around 28? 30? 75? (I have no damned clue) and who's still single, and since summer is approaching, she gets a gazillion wedding invitations, she doesn't wanna go there solo because people would start pitying her and crap (Yeah because getting married is the ultimate goal in life and if you can't do that by 27 it's game over for you *cue eyeroll*). Then, her best friend, Sean, says that they should go together and pretend to be a couple.Anywaaaaaaaaaays, before the wedding season starts Sean gets hurt and whatnot and can't even go back to the states for the meantime so he sends his older brother Ryan so sub for him.One thing leads to another and \nyou guessed it right\n Ryan and Tricia sleep together.Oh and the cherry on top? Ryan says that he liked her even before, even though about ten pages ago he did say that he only saw her for about 3 minutes every once in a while, and didn't know the first thing about her, but we're just gonna overlook that since he's hot and it's better to make him seem like the hopeless romantic type.At one of those weddings, and before Ryan and Tricia could DTR, they Skype with Sean, and he asks them -his brother and best friend that he knows damn well are pretending for the sake of the public eye- when their wedding was?I was like, wow real smooth Sean.Then he went on and said that if he's not getting a wedding date, then the least he could get was see them kiss; which by the way Ryan complied with.After that wedding and a lot of sex, it's morning and Ryan is getting all worked up about something. He then decides to go visit his mother and surprise surprise, Sean is there.Turns out the little shit was home for some while now and was enjoying playing matchmaker, and his mom was in on it too.Naturally, Ryan is pissed off, and naturally he lets it out on Tricia and hurts her.A week later he's back to apologize and while she's rejecting him, they get a call from a hospital saying his mom got a heart attack, which turns out to be an anxiety attack because her boyfriend -that no one even knew existed- proposed.Can you imagine that scene though? The guy is on one knee asking her to spend the rest of her life with him and the next thing you know she's on the ground heaving for air XDDDI'm sorry but that's hilarious.Then they go back to their hotel room and they kiss and make up and everything is all rainbows and butterflies.THEN, we have an epilogue with Ryan and Tricia and his mom n her boyfriend preparing for their weddings AND planning to set Sean up with Tricia's cousin, even though both Ryan and Tricia were pissed off when that happened to them.The freaking end. I'm not even sure what I disliked the most about this book; the flat characters, the pointless plot, or the cliche-ness of it all but by the time I got to the end I was frustrated at myself for reading yet another Kobo freebie after saying I was done with them.\nHonorable mentions to: \n- How \"manly\" Ryan is and how perfect he is and all, because it can't be a book without mentioning that.- How Tricia has \"blossomed\" into a gorgeous woman that caught Ryan's eyes after being a small child. I hate to break it to you buddy but that's called growing up and believe it or not, everyone goes through it.I am seriously more than done with these kinda books, they're all the same thing wrapped up in different paper; and what's inside isn't even that good."}, {"userName": "Debbie Hanson", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12294330-debbie-hanson", "userReview": "The Wedding Season Samantha Chase 4 sweet stars.Sometimes in life all you need is a sweet easy read and The Wedding Season was just that.

The characters are pretty flimsy so you don't really care about whether or not Tricia will get it together with Ryan, there isn't really any suspense as to whether it is Sean that she really loves.Quick and easy read that passes the time on a commute or when reading time is limited and you have one eye on the clock the whole time.

I have to admit, I read the first two books out of order without realizing this was a series. There's no problem with that because they can be read as standalones except when you're reading the epilogue. This installment focuses on our heroine Tricia Patterson and our hero Ryan Peterson. Tricia is best friends with Sean, (Ryan's younger brother) since high school. The Plot: Tricia and Sean have six (6) weddings to attend this summer and don't want the pity or matchmaking of their friends but have to attend all. Sean and Trish hatch a plan to pretend they are dating in order to get thru the wedding season but Sean is hurt overseas and asks his brother Ryan to take his place. The romance happened fairly quickly but was covered up by the fact that Ryan and Trish have known each other for as long as her and Sean have been BFF's. I enjoyed this story, it had some erotic moments but didn't go overboard and give us full details each time it happened. The details were more about how this couple eased into getting to know each other and slowly falling in love, I liked both characters. I even liked the secondary characters especially the Mother, \"Steph' even though she's a little self-centered.
