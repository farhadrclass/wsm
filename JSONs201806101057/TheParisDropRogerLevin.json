I chose this one because of the Paris locale. However, his writing style hadn't yet developed at this time. The plot hinged on a few heavy-handed coincidences and it was hard to understand why so many people were so worked up about the substance hidden in the ring."}, {"userName": "E", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28727983-e", "userReview": "Hard to rate. Somewhere in the 2 to 3 range, I suppose a bit closer to the latter. Won't be surprised to see Alan Furst's favorite city show up in the title of his second novel. I've always thought his Night Soldiers plots were sneakily simplistic. This is is the opposite--unnecessarily complex. Our ex-drug dealer \"hero\" is now delivering money from a New York temple to a pro-Israeli outfit based in Paris. But he's also delivering a class ring from his uncle to Paris as well (that's the \"O\" on the cover). But what's so special about this ring . . . I won't spoil the surprise, but it did make me laugh. What a MacGuffin. The plot was equal parts surreal and implausible, but somehow I don't think my review is doing it justice, because I just awarded it three stars. Somehow Furst managed to write a third novel in this series before going on to something else (not Night Soldiers), so I'm quite curious to see how he managed."}], "description": "", "title": "The Paris Drop\n      \n          (Roger Levin #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2418484.The_Paris_drop", "average": 3.46, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320584058l/2418484.jpg", "reviews": 3, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/49941.Alan_Furst", "name": "Alan Furst"}], "type": ["Spy Thriller", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2418484.The_Paris_Drop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/627614.Night_Soldiers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12963396-mission-to-paris", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2294328.The_Spies_of_Warsaw", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/919231.The_World_at_Night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/435897.Dark_Star"]}
