It\u2018s in the Author\u2018s Note at the end:The fourth volume in the tale of the Dark Tower should appear - always assuming the continuation of Constant Writer\u2019s life and Constant Reader\u2019s interest - in the not-too-distant-future.It took six years for the next book to come out. Six. Goddamn. Years.Six years may not seem too bad to fans of authors who only release a book every decade or so, but there\u2019s a couple of factors that made this false statement particularly bitter. The Waste Lands ends on a nail biting cliffhanger. I literally yelled aloud in frustration the first time I read this back in 1991 and realized that I\u2019d have to wait for the next book to learn the fate of Roland and his friends. Still, after some reflection it didn\u2019t seem that bad. The next volume would appear \u2018in the not-too-distant-future\u2019, right? Besides this was Stephen King, the writer who churned out 1000 page books like McDonald\u2019s makes Big Macs. No big deal. I\u2019d be reading it by \u201892. 1993 at the latest.Five goddamn years later, and I\u2019d gone from Stephen King and Dark Tower fan to the kind of crazed fury usually reserved for jilted lovers. It didn\u2019t help that King was cranking out big fat books including some utter shit like Insomnia and Rose Madder. Yet no fourth Dark Tower book, and every now and then I\u2019d reread the first three volumes and dream of the day when I\u2019d finally learn what happened next.The odd thing is that it still kind of pisses me off even now that the series is finished. I get that same sense of frustration when I read this remembering the six goddamn years between books while seeing all kinds of other King novels come out. It\u2019s too bad because this was my favorite of the first three books until frustration turned it into an irritating loose end.And I\u2019ll confess something that makes me a small, petty person. Deep down in my shriveled black soul, I\u2019m resentful and jealous of anyone who reads the series now or who started reading it when the last three books were coming out like clockwork at the end. They didn\u2019t suffer like the ones who read this and waited six years. Then read the fourth one and waited SIX MORE GODDAMN YEARS FOR THE FIFTH ONE. YEAH, THAT\u2019S RIGHT! BETWEEN 1991 AND 2003 STEPHEN FUCKING KING, ONE-OF-THE-MOST-PROFILIC-WRITERS-I\u2019VE-EVER-READ, MANAGED TO WRITE JUST ONE GODDAMN DARK TOWER BOOK AND IF THAT MINIVAN HADN\u2019T VERY NEARLY KILLED HIS PROCRASTINATING ASS, I\u2019D PROBABLY STILL BE WAITING!!*ahem* Excuse me. I\u2019ve still got a few unresolved issues with old Steve about this series.And what about the story in this book? Roland is training Eddie and Susannah to be gunslingers, but he\u2019s going crazy from a paradox he created in the last book by time hopping to our world and changing an event that altered his own timeline. They also find a creepy old decayed city filled with a murderous mob and have to deal with a monorail that is criminally insane.It\u2019s terrific, but I think the waiting drove me a little mad. And now King has been making noises about possibly doing another book that would fill some of the SIX GODDAMN YEAR GAP between #4 and #5. You\u2019ll pardon me if I don\u2019t hold my breath."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "[For this Excursion, proper \u201cprotection\u201d shall be provided and MUST be used to prevent the creation of infernal offspring (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Luca Ambrosino", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53478239-luca-ambrosino", "userReview": "English (The Waste Lands) / ItalianoHappiness while watching the drawing of the metal plate found on the just killed bear, happiness that I feel for the unpredictable and the inexplicable.

However, there is still somebody to recruit for the company to be complete...In the author's note at the end of the book, King predicts that some readers will probably be disappointed by the unanswered questions that this novel leaves.

The reason I said at the time was that I thought that at least one book in the series will blow me away. So this is book three and here it is, a five star rating.This volume of the Dark Tower brings all of the characters together. We learn about their histories, how they link to each other in their previous lives in 'our world' and what their role is as they join Roland on the quest for the Dark Tower.Now permanently in Roland's world, although it has moved on, the group really begin the quest for the tower. As they travel across the lands they make strange discoveries that start to open their eyes to just what it is they are facing. Roland begins to open up, as he gains their trust, and starts to let them in on what his experiences have been and what they can expect as they move forward.Roland, as a Gunslinger, is still very much revered in this land but it is the addition of young Jake to the group that seems to hold the future. Each member of the group is finding out more about themselves too and the skills they can bring. The journey moves along at a faster pace towards the end of the book and yet more characters are introduced. The world has taken on a post-apocalyptic feel and ends again with yet more questions to be answered."}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "[Are the robots at the portal symbolic of the ultimately circular nature of Roland's quest?

I consider this volume to be the best out of the three that I\u2019ve read so far. If the book had stopped midway it would have got the maximum recognition from me, no doubt. I love and hate King\u2019s way of writing too much. He managed to keep me at the edge of my seat for 100 pages, hungry for more, promising my undying love and then, after the climax (the forth drawing), he slightly bores me for the next 100. Maybe the plot got too intense and he thought we needed a cool down but still, my serotonin levels dropped too much. The best part of the novel for me was the drawing of the 4th member of the Ka-tet after an adrenaline pumping sequence of evince in both worlds. I was enthralled by the changing of perspective from one world to another. The tension of those moments was King at his best. Even breathing was a nuisance as I feverishly turned page after page in order to see what happens next. The Waste Lands is the first in the series to finish with a cliffhanger but I won\u2019t be rushing to start the next one as I do not want to overdose on King and lose interest."}, {"userName": "Jeff ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12618229-jeff", "userReview": "Take the guesswork out of your next vacation!!

After evil ways and evil days, the White comes again! Be of good heart and hold up your heads, for ye have lived to see the wheel of ka begin to turn once more!\"\nWhat a journey! From incomprehensibly horrible to absodamnlutely fantastic to okay.This book was all over the place. Both literally and metaphorically.The first half is more of what we\u2019re given in The Drawing of the Three. That is... a painfully boring story about Roland leaving his wildly interesting world behind to pick up three annoying travelling companions from different times and places in the city of New York.To clarify for those still in doubt, I fucking hated that shit was slightly disappointed by these developments.About halfway through however, the story steps into a whole new world (literally), and that world is like heaven compared to what has happened so far (to be frank, it wasn\u2019t that good, but hey, after one and a half book of utter boredom you take what you can get).Roland of Gilead assembles his company of gunslingers, and as the quest for the Dark Tower begins in earnest, the ka-tet arrives at the little town of River Crossing.A great civil war - perhaps in Garlan, perhaps in a more distant land called Porla - had erupted three, perhaps even four hundred years ago. Its ripples had spread slowly outward, pushing anarchy and dissension ahead of them. Few if any kingdoms had been able to stand against those slow waves, and anarchy had come to this part of the world as surely as night follows sunset. At one time, whole armies had been on the roads, sometimes in advance, sometimes in retreat, always confused and without long-term goals. As time passed, they crumbled into smaller groups, and these degenerated into roving bands of harriers. Trade faltered, then broke down entirely. Travel went from a matter of inconvenience to one of danger. In the end, it became almost impossible. Communication with the city thinned steadily and had all but ceased a hundred and twenty years ago.Like a hundred other towns Roland had ridden through - first with Cuthbert and the other gunslingers cast out of Gilead, then alone, in pursuit of the man in black - River Crossing had been cut off and thrown on its own resources.River Crossing is a paradise of fantasy worldbuilding. While Stephen King has kept his cards close about the gunslingers and their world so far, he now starts showing his hand. And if you think this guy cannot really write fantasy, you are sorely mistaken.Here starts a rain of epic stories and descriptions of places and names beyond any normal imagination...\u201cWhat is Mid-World?\u201d Eddie asked.\u201cOne of the large kingdoms which dominated the earth in the times before these. A kingdom of hope and knowledge and light\u2014the sort of things we were trying to hold on to in my land before the darkness overtook us, as well. Some day if there\u2019s time, I\u2019ll tell you all the old stories . . . the ones I know, at least. They form a large tapestry, one which is beautiful but very sad.\u201cAccording to the old tales, a great city once stood at the edge of Mid-World - perhaps as great as your city of New York. It will be in ruins now, if it still exists at all. But there may be people... or monsters... or both. We\u2019ll have to be on our guard.\"The rest of the book is not quite as good as the amazing part at River Crossing, but it\u2019s still much better than anything in the series since the opening sentence of the first book. However, it ends with a horrible cliffhanger. Well, not even a cliffhanger, but in the middle of a scene. It\u2019s like one of those old TV shows ending with \u201cTo be continued\u201d just at the climax.But despite my ratings and sometimes low opinions, and even though it feels like the story hasn\u2019t even started yet (three books in!), I\u2019m greatly looking forward to the continuation.Dark Tower reviews:#1 \nThe Gunslinger\n#2 \nThe Drawing of the Three\n#3 \nThe Waste Lands\n#4 \nWizard and Glass\n#5 \nWolves of the Calla\n#6 \nSong of Susannah\n#7 \nThe Dark Tower"}, {"userName": "Ms. Smartarse", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13703358-ms-smartarse", "userReview": "[the bridge crossing scene (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "[ in this book the set pieces are : a fight with a giant bear, a dramatic crossing of a portal between worlds by Jake, the crossing of a high suspension bridge, an undergound duel in a dying city.

I\u2019ve been through this series so many times over the years I have lost count. But what has made this trip so important is all of the wonderful people I have gotten to take along the Path of the Beam. I would like to thank my posse for allowing me to hold their hands and guide them on this most epic of quests. Rootin\u2019 Tootin Pistol Packin\u2019 Delee,  Jumpin\u2019 Jeff ,  Calamity Bev and last but certainly not least, Bronco Bustin\u2019 Black Jackin\u2019 Jason I am a pusher of books, anyone who has had even a minute\u2019s interaction with me can attest to this. I get especially pushy when I know the books could change someone\u2019s life. There is only a handful of books that fall into that category for me-obviously, the Harry Potter series and of course, the Dark Tower series.While I love the shit out of Harry Potter, the Dark Tower series actually changed my view on life and what it all means. I had a breakthrough. I\u2019ve always been a cynical, show me don\u2019t tell me type and the Dark Tower series gave me something to believe in; something that made sense to me. I\u2019ve never been religious, but I\u2019m not an Atheist either. I fall more in line with Agnostics. My problem is that I want to believe everything so much I can\u2019t believe anything.Ka. Ka is something all of its own. It does not bend to your will. It does not care for your plans. If you detour around it, you\u2019ll still find yourself where you were meant to be. The wheel of Ka keeps turning and your best bet is to sit back and enjoy the ride. There\u2019s truly no point in fighting it. We start out with one hell of a paradox. Poor Roland, given the events in  the Drawing of the Three is torn between what happened and what didn\u2019t happen. Did Jake accompany him through the desert and up the mountains? Did Jake exist in this world? Did Roland let him fall? How could he have let him fall if he was never there? Roland is in rough shape and only the key can help.Eddie and Susannah have taken nuptial vows and found a love that is both deserving and beautiful. They are a good match for one another, though, if I am to be honest, I think I would be a much better match for Eddie. Maybe the wheel of Ka will roll through and make that happen for me? What do you say, Ka?! *looks around hopefully*Eddie sees that he will need to play a big role in Jake\u2019s drawing into this world. What he doesn\u2019t know is if he is cut out for it, or if he\u2019ll be ready in time. Eddie is constantly at war with himself from the years of being mentally beat down by his older brother. Susannah Dean, who was once Odetta Holmes and Detta Walker, is trying her best to maintain her one mind now that her alternate personalities have been forced to face one another. She is also trying to figure out her place in this new strange place.Jake\u2019s drawing into this world is by far my favorite sequence in this whole book. It is such an intense turn of events. The splitting minds, the split perspective and most especially the fact that while Eddie\u2019s door faces down, Jake enters it vertically just creates this insane imagry that blows me away every time.Then there is Oy. What a wonderful creature King has produced. Oy makes my heart feel so happy with love and pride I can hardly contain myself. He represents all that is good and innocent in this world and his relationship with \u2018Ake is one of the best parts of the Dark Tower series.Our favorite Ka-Tet is on the Path of the Beam in search of Blaine the Mono. Blain is a pain, and this they know; but he is also a necessity to their quest. Will they make it to him in time? Will Blaine still be there? If he is there, is he sane? Can a train be sane? Where will this story go?The Waste Lands, while not as good as Drawing of the Three, gives us insight into some of King\u2019s best written characters. We get to know them individually while seeing them interact with one another. My favorite interactions are between Roland and Eddie. Roland, so severe and earnest in every aspect vs. the nonstop joker, Eddie, makes for some great entertainment. The character arcs throughout this series are some of the most fascinating that I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of reading. Each and every time I read this series I find something new that makes me love them all the more. \n\u201c[Eddie] cried out but his cry was lost in the golden blast of some tremendous horn. It came from the top of the Tower, and seemed to fill the world. As that note of warning held and drew out over the field where he stood, blackness welled from the windows which girdled the Tower. It overspilled them and spread across the sky in flaggy streams which came together and formed a growing blotch of darkness. It did not look like a cloud; it looked like a tumor hanging over the earth. The sky was blotted out. And, he saw, it was not a cloud or a tumor but a shape, some tenebrous, cyclopean shape racing toward the place where he stood.\u201d"}, {"userName": "R.K.

In fact, I will look at it as a positive, for I cannot wait to begin book 4. Mid-world is continuing to grow, and the questions to its existence continue to be answered. It's funny, while reading this you cannot believe how brilliant King's mind is to have the kind of foresight he did in creating this fantasy only to find out he's the first to admit the story wrote itself.

Ka-tet is the place where many lives are joined by fate.\u201dThis is the book where Roland\u2019s ka-tet is fully formed*, with the addition of eleven years old Jake Chambers and Oy the billy-bumbler (a Mid-World species). Ka-Tet. Art by Michael WhelanIn this eventful installment Roland, Eddie and Susannah continue their quest for the Dark Tower, along the way Roland starts going insane as his recent timeline has been doubled due to an incident in  The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three in which Jake Chambers who died in book #1 is saved through Roland interfering with a key event in his past. This causes a paradox where both Roland and Jake remember two alternate versions of the past, and the conflicting versions fight for supremacy in their minds. To save Roland\u2019s sanity, Roland, Eddie and Susannah must help Jake to cross over from our Earth into Mid-World, an extremely dangerous task involving entry into a nasty magic circle in Mid-World, guarded by a sex-crazed demon, on Jake\u2019s side (in our world) the portal is in a haunted house with a monstrous gatekeeper. This mission forms the first half of The Waste Lands, it makes for a hair-raising adventure with a very dark undertone, as depicted on the cover of this hardback edition:Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t give you much info on what transpires in the equally hectic second half of the book, but it does involve a crazy train (nothing to do with Ozzy).I am tremendously enjoying this Dark Tower series reread; this is the only advantageous aspect of having a memory like a sieve, I can enjoy these books just as much as the first time I read them. Like  The Drawing of the Three The Waste Lands is packed with incident and characterization engrossing (the first book  The Gunslinger is very good but less intense). Interestingly there is more of a sci-fi element in this installment with mad AIs, cyborgs (also mad), high technology, and computers; lest we forget, this is a world where magic and technology coexist. It is also very nice to find tributes to  Isaac Asimov,  Richard Adams and  J. R. R. Tolkien in the narrative; it is like finding that your favorite band also dig your other favorite bands. King puts a lot of effort into developing his characters, this has always been his secret weapon. However, what makes the Dark Tower series stand out among thousands of other fantasy series is the western aesthetic of Mid-World, and also Roland\u2019s forays into our world and. This makes a nice change to the standard medieval setting of most epic fantasy series; the sci-fi and horror aspects further distinguishes it from the others.Unlike the previous two volumes The Waste Lands ends on a cliff hanger, as the entire series is completed this should not be a cause for concern. I imagine most people who have read the previous books are bound to want to read this one. When you have come this far the rest is unavoidable. Should you read this book? In the end, all things, even this review, serve the Dark Tower.Notes* Another character is added to the ka-tet in book #5,  Wolves of the Calla. but these five are the classic lineup.\u2022 An excellent companion to this book is  Charlie the Choo-Choo: From the world of The Dark Tower, a creepy faux-children\u2019s book. \u2022 Guns and roses play an important part in this book, nothing to do with Axl Rose.\u2022 The song \u201c Velcro Fly \u201d is also significant in this book, it has everything to do with ZZ Top.\u2022 Wild West themed fantasy is not unique to the Dark Tower series, it is a subgenre called \u201cweird west\u201d. If you are interested there is a list of these books on this Wikipedia page. I have not read any of the books listed there (apart from Dark Tower, obviously) but I have read another excellent \u201cweird west\u201d series. It is called  Jon Shannow Series by the wonderful and much missed  David Gemmell. If you have read all the Dark Towers I recommend checking it out, Gemmell is a very different author from Stephen King so you don\u2019t need to worry if it will read like an imitation.Quotes:\u201cThere were a lot of stories for kids with stuff like this in them, stuff that threw acid all over your emotions. Hansel and Gretel being turned out into the forest, Bambi\u2019s mother getting scragged by a hunter, the death of Old Yeller. It was easy to hurt little kids, easy to make them cry, and this seemed to bring out a strangely sadistic streak in many storytellers.\u201d\u201cWhatever his head thought about this gunslinging business, his hands had discovered they liked it just fine.\u201d\u201cWe are ka-tet,\u201d Roland began, \u201cwhich means a group of people bound together by fate. The philosophers of my land said a ka-tet could only be broken by death or treachery.\u201cIn the fierce furnace of Elmer Chambers\u2019s mind, the gross carbon of wish and opinion was often blasted into the hard diamonds which he called facts . . . or, in more informal circumstances, \u201cfactoids.\u201d\u201d\u201cHe called it The Net of Eratosthenes.

It's nice re-reading these via audio, even if I have to wait a few weeks in between books while waiting for the next audio book to come in to the library. This time I don't have to wait years in between books which keeps everything fresh in my mind. I have to respect a mind that is so wildly imaginative that it can put together a story of this scope.

I love the connections between the characters' past lives and between Mid-World and Our When. I also felt a strong link to other Stephen King books: a mansion in Brooklyn comes to life and it was The Overlook all over again for me. The middle of the book (the mansion part) was the most amazing part of a completely amazing story. It could have just ended there for me emotionally, but it's all about the quest. So, onward to Lud which brings every nuked out NYC full of mutants and psychos immediately to mind. Also amazing, exciting and full of connections.

But I somehow doubt it because this magnificent book reintroduces one of my favourite characters from the series, introduces another favourite character AND introduces my favourite \"villain\" from this series. I won't name any names because I don't want to spoil it for anyone! I also thoroughly enjoyed the world building that happened in this book, I feel like this is where King truly starts to hit his stride for this series! His writing is so beautifully detailed that I can see the landscape and the buildings emerging in my mind as I read and it is truly stunning! Despite this book being longer than both previous ones, it almost felt like it was shorter because it was just filled with so much action and development, it was hard to stop turning the pages once I picked it up!

I saw different landscapes, different views of the city and train station etc. Here we see Roland (The Gunslinger) with the people he drew in the previous book from our world to his world moving towards their destination. Before they reach an abandoned city the also draw Jake the young boy from New York and with him the core of the fellowship is completed. So before they reach the dystopian-ish town of Lud the book was pretty slow but from there it took off and I was able to read it in less than 2 days. Of course the book ends in a cliffhanger and will learn about it at the beginning of the 4th book, a book I will eventually start at the end of the Easter Holidays. A book I 1st read in August 2012 and loved and became an instant favourite.And since I'm talking about favourite(s), my favourite character in the series is Jake, not Eddie or Odetta/Detta/Susannah, or Roland; even though I like them. Jake is innocent, young, and we see him as a boy with no family (he has a family, but he's alienated from them. They care more about their jobs and their social interactions. Their son is for show off.) He reads the same book I read a few weeks ago (Charlie the Choo-Choo), he experiences an adventure in a haunted house, he spends a horrifying period in the hands of a vile person (he's more inhuman than human), named Gasher, and I felt really sorry for him.So this book started with a good pace, then it slowed down and then as if the author injected NOS in his writing we sped up towards the end, fast.Hence 8/10So see you in a few weeks. . ."}, {"userName": "Monty desai", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3351724-monty-desai", "userReview": "[RE-READ]THE DARK TOWER SERIES BOOK 3:ROLAND AFTER SOLVING THE DRAWING OF THE THREE PUZZLE...FORMS HIS KA-TET.KA-TET THEN FACE SHARDIK THE BEAR, ONE OF THE GUARDIANS OF ONE OF THE 12 BEAMS THAT HOLD THE DARK TOWER...(THEY ENTER MID-WORLD)AFTER BATTLING HIM KA-TET FOLLOW THE SOUTHEAST DIRECTION OF THE BEAM.

One person gives it up after the first thirty pages of the first book because it's so fucking weird, the next wants to read all of them in a mad, passionate frenzy. One person thinks book two is the greatest (me), another thinks it's boring as shit (an opinion I can't understand). Yet another counts this here book as their favorite and reviles book four. Etc, etc.I find this fascinating, and for me, it's evidence that King has a vision that he is executing at the expense of nothing. These are weird books, and only getting weirder, even as the story makes more sense. Every other book I've read of his has been accessible in style and subject matter, and even the fantastical ones have played by the rules. Pants-shitting terrifying, or disturbing? Yes, often and more than not. But never like this.With this series, King seems to be reaching deep down into the crevasses* of his mind and pulling up story from the deep below. From the first page of The Gunslinger, this story felt like a fever dream, real and yet unreal at the same time, metaphors made tangible, side by side with mundane, solid reality. The imagery contained in these first three books, which is at its strongest in this third book, has such power it drives the story seemingly without need for an author. (This feeling of mine was validated in the Author's Note at the end, when he says that the book wrote itself.)*And yes, I mean \"crevasses,\" not \"crevices\" here. I'm meaning to imply deep down, fucked up subconscious shit going on. Deep fucking glacier crack nonsense, none of this 'ooh, just a little fissure' imagery. \"Crevices\" is not gonna get that done.This one didn't do it for me in as clear and simple a way as The Drawing of Three did, but I liked it nonetheless. It has less discovery and introspection, and more movement and action, which are never my favorite things. But what is there is so fucking bizarre at times, and always with that same real/not-real quality, it seems like King has pulled some of it from the primal recesses of your own mind.The book is essentially split in two. The first half sees Roland training up his two new gunslingers, and finally bringing the final members of their ka-tet together, also dealing with the ramifications of what happened to Jake back in the first book. The second half is actually the beginning of their journey. They're done preparing, they've gathered the fellowship and met with the Council of Elrond (so to speak), and all the members of the ka-tet have shared (most of) their knowledge with one another. And that's when it really gets weird. The last fifty pages of this book were so freaky, but so hard to put down.The book ends on a cliffhanger of sorts, although I'm with King in that it feels like the right place to end this chapter of the story. I can definitely see how it would have driven people insane to wait the six years in between this book and the next, but I also really like the idea of Roland and his ka-tet on that Disneyland train-ride from (or is it to?) Hell, in a sort of suspended animation, waiting to see what happens next. Is that perverse? I dunno, I guess I'm kinda perverse."}, {"userName": "Cindy Newton", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6082517-cindy-newton", "userReview": "[The appearance of a psychotic, riddle-obsessed, suicidal train was a twist I did not see coming.

Besides the fact that I am glued to the pages for hours at a time, I really like the idea of this mysterious world giving guidance to the Gunslinger and his band. Instead of opting for the prophecy motif, King's world is much more mysterious and less traditional.***Beware spoilers for the The Gunslinger and The Drawing of the Three***Our crew of gunslingers, or Ka-tet as we find out they are called because they are a group of people on the same mission whose fates are intertwined, begin this part of the journey in the middle of their training as gunslingers. They are the last of their kind and therefore, Eddie, Susannah Dean, and Roland are the only gunslingers in the entire world.Because Roland saved Jake (the kid at the waystation in The Gunstlinger) from Jack Mort in The Drawing of the Three, his memory has now split in two because Jake's death was his entry into Roland's world. This is making Roland a bit crazy at the moment.They are almost immediately attacked by a malicious and ravenous bear, Shardik, who we find out is actually a Guardian of one of the entrances to the 6 mystical beams that will lead to the dark tower. Oh, and did I mention Shardik is also a cyborg? Yeah, this just gets crazier and crazier.The ka-tet follow the beam to Mid-world where more adventure is to be had, but not before picking up another member.I had always thought they were in Mid-world when they weren't in \"our\" present day world, but I guess I'd read too much going into this. In The Waste Lands, there's actually a point where the ka-tet goes into Mid-world.At this same time, but beginning in Book 2 of The Waste Lands, we also begin to follow Jake in \"our\" world. He's having the same problems as Roland and his mind is also warring with itself. While trying to make it in a high-pressured prep school, Jake is about to give up. Not only is Jake going insane, but it is almost as if he is reliving certain occurrences. This leads him on his own journey and I'll leave it at that before I get too spoilerific.***End major spoilers***I know Stephen King is known for his horror, but I haven't felt much of that influence really until this book. Toward the end, I was actually dreadfully frightened and I loved it.Why Read The Waste Lands?When I really think of it, I can't believe the entire plot can be summed up so simply; a gunslinger is after a dark tower. And I guess only Stephen King can make something so simple so amazingly addicting.I can't wait to get on with the series. It's unique and well-crafted. You can't help but care for these characters even though it sometimes seems like Stephen King doesn't. You will be glued to the page, it's just a fact.4.5 out of 5 Stars (Absolutely loved it!)"}, {"userName": "Brian ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30718608-brian", "userReview": "I started reading this to the Lord of the Rings soundtrack but started losing interest in the book. When I turned off the music I discovered the book has its own music. I mean that almost literally because it seemed so real to me. This book is like the first time you saw Star Wars or Return of the Jedi when Luke was flipping around fighting his Dad. It\u2019s like some epic story that covers the primary elements of the Greats; the deeper, more intimate, secret, unknown elements of these stories. They are the elements you can\u2019t quite put your finger on but you can feel them. You can feel them in The Lord of the Rings when your heart burns like a fire inside of you or in The Silmarillion when your spirit and soul are awed by the greatness of this wonder and your heart rips and breaks and you weep inside when the Light of Valinor is destroyed. Something invisible, powerful. Something eternal. So here is my attempt to cover what this book is about according to the music I heard in it. Here is an attempt at a book trailer. I\u2019ll try to refrain from spoilers:There is darkness, and in the darkness you hear creaking of metal and wood. A small boy is breathing heavy, in fear. He speaks these words: \u201cGo then, there are other worlds than these.\u201d That\u2019s all you hear, then a picture surfaces. You realize you have seen this before. It\u2019s from the first book in the series. Jake is hanging over a pit. The Gunslinger is holding him over sudden death. The grip releases. The boy falls into darkness. Roland awakes, startled, lying next to a campfire. He speaks in the background while he places his head in hands. His face looks perplexed, tormented. His voice says, \u201cThere was a boy.\u201d  You see Jake. He is walking down the street in New York City.  \u201cHe died and I met him.\u201d  You see Jake walking into class and looking down at a piece of paper.  \u201cThen he lived because I saved him.\u201d  The paper scrolls down and you see it is a poem. A picture of a train is on it.  The next caption is Jake close up. He is walking again down the sidewalk in New York City. His voice is in the background while he walks. \u201cI know there was a man.\u201d  He has a backpack on and he is approaching a high fence protecting an abandoned lot. He pulls the back pack off and throws it over, then begins to climb.  \u201cHe was a powerful man. A Gunslinger.\u201d  Jake looks around in wonder, fear, amazement. His face looks as if something is speaking to him.  \u201cHe had those eyes. Those blue bombardier eyes.\u201d  Then you hear a choir, a choir of a thousand voices. Jake approaches a rose. In the rose a sun shines brightly and you draw closer and closer to it until a sun blares into your eyes.  Jake\u2019s voice again: \u201cI have to find him. I have to get back to him.\u201d Drums and sudden beats set in along with dramatic music. Pictures flash across the screen with the music. You see these flash across your eyes:A giant bear shaking a tree and roaring. Eddie flinging back and forth, clinging for his life.A giant monster head pushing out of a wall. Teeth forming. Jake running and screaming.Eddie molding a key out of wood. Jake dropping a key with a look of nightmarish terror in his face.A cute looking dog looking animal jumping into Jakes arms and licking his face.Jake leveling a gun and pulling the trigger, looking like a real badass.Eddie and Susannah shooting a bunch of deformed looking people who are attacking them.Jakes dog-like animal falling from a bridge and latching on to Jakes hand with its teeth.Jake, Roland and Eddie clinging to broken bridge wires thousands of feet over a drop, with the animal hanging from Jakes hand.The music stops.The five of them (including the animal) are standing in front of a smooth looking train that looks like a smooth, gigantic bullet.A mechanical and maniacal voice says, \u201cI\u2019M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS VERY MUCH. MAY I SUGGEST YOU CLIMB ON BOARD QUICKLY? IN FACT, YOU MAY WISH TO RUN. I AM ABOUT TO RELEASE THE GAS THAT WILL KILL EVERYONE IN THIS CITY.\u201dThe mechanical voice erupts in lunatic laughter, high pitched and psychotic.A train shoots like a bullet beneath a beam of light.The laughter continues.One last shot shows Jake sitting next to Roland. He whispers, \u201cThat\u2019s Blaine. He\u2019s a pain.\u201dThe last thing you see is the train again. You are following with it full speed and peering down into the Wastelands, a deformed, rocky terrain with monsters and flying predatory birds and flaming lava pulsating between cracks of doom. More crazy and insane laughter.Fade out.
