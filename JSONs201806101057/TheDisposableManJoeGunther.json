Joe GuntherSETTING: Brattleboro, VermontSERIES: #9 of 25RATING: 4.0WHY: When a dead man with foreign dental work is found in a pond, it's hard to figure how he ended up in that situation. Lieutenant Joe Gunther eventually finds ties to the Russian political system. Soon he's fighting a personal battle--while at the scene of a jewelry store incident, he is found with a brooch in his pocket. He's suspended and faces a world of legal troubles. I was really engaged in the book until a rather far-fetched plot thread with warring Russian mobs took over. Joe showed quite a different side of himself; usually calm and collected, he shows a lot of emotion and a surprising ability to work outside the law."}, {"userName": "Dennis Fischman", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1342011-dennis-fischman", "userReview": "This story starts in the familiar Joe Gunther territory and figuratively ends up in the Wild West, with an excursion into John LeCarre land in between. I didn't find the Russian faction fight on Vermont soil plausible, and shootouts don't interest me. The relationships, as usual, intrigue me: both those within the department and the ongoing love story between Joe Gunther and Gail Zigman. But I hate the author for putting her through yet one more book where she feels violated because of the repercussions of Joe's work. Find some other way to move their relationship along!"}, {"userName": "Kay", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/712954-kay", "userReview": "Early in this book I was really taken with the writing and story line but by half way through it became a mish mash of Russian names CIA characters who were never clear and a plot that made no sense. I found it difficult to believe that the main character, Joe Guenther, who has won so many awards for his police work in Vermont would immediately be believed to be turned to the dark side as stealing a precious piece of jewelry with only a few of his own team taking his side. Conversely the clarification, after a conflict between Russian gangs on a hilltop, seemed so over the top that was hard to believe too. I always start out liking an Archer Mayor book but always feel lost or bored by the mid-point."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21835218-jill", "userReview": "This one disappointed me. It was not the writing as that was just as masterful as always, nor the usual cast of characters; Joe, Gail,Willie Kunkle, and Sammie. They are all as interesting as in previous books but now they are really tested as to their loyalty to Joe. Joe is set up in this one and it is seemingly a problem that WILL land him in jail. He has to break laws and to figure that his career in law enforcement will indeed be over. But the Russian connection is just too far fetched and complex to me and I frankly lost interest in anything but Joe's redemption."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31802850-anna", "userReview": "The serene landscape of Vermont is once again disturbed when a dead man is found in a quarry.

Lots of action, but strangely, not so compelling. Kind of a superficial walk through. I won't give away the plot, but let me say it involves spies.

I found the Russian spy story behind all this to be a bit confusing and messy.That being said, I do like these characters and hope he gets them back to their old ways in the future.

Joe Gunther, Brattleboro VT; police procedural/spy thriller. A dead body in an abandoned quarry leads Joe and his crew on a convoluted journey into the cold war past, the current Russian Mob, and a generally interesting exploration of lying and truth-telling, friendship and shared experiences. Rather a bit too much \u201cspy vs. spy\u201d for my taste, and the climax is far too close to \u201cDie Hard\u201d for my comfort, but the plotting is very good. the pacing excellent, and the characterizations are superb, hence the very highest rating - it was a fun read. We get to learn a great deal more about just what makes the important people in the series \u201ctick\u201d: Joe, his lover Gail, Willy and Sammie his closest friends on the force - some of it is wrenching, and all of it\u2019s interesting. I would not recommend this as your first Mayor to read of this series unless you really love convoluted spy tales, as it\u2019s not representative of the extremely good police procedural writing Mayor can, and does, do in the earlier books."}, {"userName": "Gmaharriet", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33296992-gmaharriet", "userReview": "This was #9 in Archer Mayor's Lt Joe Gunther series, and I've been enjoying all of them. I like the way he writes and most of the stories seem earthy and realistic; however, this one was much too far out there to be believable. It's a fun read, but it sent my suspension of disbelief into overdrive.I still enjoyed it, but (without giving too much away) when they had at least 10 vehicles crashing on purpose in a small college town, and everybody walks away only a little sore, I just had to walk away for a bit, before coming back and finishing it. There's more that I couldn't accept as realistic in this tale.Three stars are the fewest I've given to a book in this series. I hope #10 goes back to its usual small town realism."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11566365-ed", "userReview": "#9 in the Joe Gunther series. This is the series that defines law enforcement in Vermont. Of course, one might say it is the only series about law enforcement in Vermont. However, the series is so well written, that if transplanted to NY, CA, or IA I believe author Mayor would evoke the essence of those locales and the character of Joe Gunther would still shine.Joe Gunther is called on when a body is found in an isolated quarry. The road to the solution of the crime leads to the Russian Mafia, the CIA, and Joe's being framed for a jewel theft. Kunkle and Sammie prove to be stout allies."}, {"userName": "Marti", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2060998-marti", "userReview": "I have read several other Joe Gunther books, and enjoyed them.
