I'd be happy to respond to the first draft of your new fantasy novel. Lets start with the good: I enjoyed your method of immersing the reader in your fantasy world. The protagonist's case of amnesia makes it so he must learn all the same things the reader needs to know. Protagonist Corwin regains his memory gradually, creating a sense of mystery throughout the first hundred pages that is quite entertaining. Then. . . well, you lost me. I mean, it's so esoteric. SHADOW REALMS, one for every combination of things that could be. Nine princes who can travel at will between these Shadow Realms. But there's really only ONE REAL WORLD, the world of Amber, of which all the other worlds are shadows. All of these princes want to be the king of Amber, and they struggle against each other for the throne . . .Well, one issue I have is that I'm not sure why I should side with Corwin. I'm not entirely convinced he's the \"good guy.\" It's sort of like voting for Zeus instead of Hera. They're all egomaniacal wackjobs. And then you tell us, most of the way through the novel, each one of these brothers could technically make their own perfect reproduction of the original world of Amber, and ALL be kings of identical territories, AND COMPLETELY BYPASS ALL OF THIS FIGHTING TO THE DEATH?! So WHY. The FUCK. Should your reader care? As Tim Gunn would say, \"This part has me worried.\" Before attempting to get this published, I HIGHLY recommend reconsidering how omnipotent this set-up will make your protagonist. At the very least, don't point out to your reader how ludicrous this whole war is. Another big issue I had was with your voice in this novel. I mean, sometimes you're all \"If thou will help me to smote down ye evyl brother Eric, your noble brother Corwin shall be beholden to you.\" Then, a scene later, you're all, \"I snuck out of the prison because I'm just that good. Dig? Solid.\" Are we casual? Are we not casual? Let's just decide. Either could work, but both don't. Also, you should know my interest tapered off drastically at the exact moment when things should've started getting exciting. The actual battle over Amber seemed . . . well, dull. First off, it's narrated kind of like an eight-year-old would narrate an action figure battle: \"seven of the big furry red guys were killed. Three of their soldiers died. Seventy of the goodguys got blown off the snowy mountain. I stabbed some guy in the neck.\" You start a hell of a lot of sentences with \"I did this.\" I was distracted by this. I could not visualize much of anything. I was tempted to skim.I'm sure this is your rough draft, despite the artificially yellowed pages and cool imitation 70's cover, mostly because of the excessive typos. My personal favorite: \"the doors of good food.\" Did you mean Odors? I think so. I would fix that, and also doublecheck your punctuation. Commas seem like an unpredictable force in this book, happening sporadically and without logic. So, as I tell all my writing students, allways proofread. By the way, I loved the ironic quip on the front about \"Hugo and Nebula Winning.\" After a few more drafts, that may become a reality, but remember my mantra: revise, revise, revise!"}, {"userName": "Evgeny", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9340136-evgeny", "userReview": "I will make it brief. This series is the first of the two reasons 75% of the books I read are fantasy. Howard's Conan was the second reason. Thus the rating for this book and all following is 5 stars, period. Do you really want the longer version? Even if you do not here it is. An unnamed guy woke up from drugged stupor in a hospital. His mental abilities were good enough enough to realize he was kept under drugs. He escaped and managed to acquire the address of a woman who placed him there - supposedly his sister. The sister bit was true by the way, but I am getting ahead of myself. Trying to regain his memory the poor guy soon learned the true story is much deeper than he suspected and to get to the bottom of this he needed to visit a mysterious and fascinating place called Amber. The only problem was, the place and all the roads leading to it were full of people literally dreaming of killing unlucky amnesiac. What follows is the best world-building in fantasy. I am very serious when I say nothing comes even remotely close. I tried to summarize it in my notes and realized that their length was not much shorter than the book itself (less than 150 pages). The latter also contained non-stop action and occasional descriptions that made the places in question come alive. This ability - to write short and to the point - is completely lost in modern literature. Modern writers think endless descriptions of food, heraldic, and so on constitute world-building. In case any aspiring fantasy writer read this let me assure you: these above constitute boredom. If you bored the book feels longer, so I can only assume this is done on purpose. This quote was written in Victorian Britain and still rings true:\u201cNothing is easier to write than scenery; nothing more difficult and unnecessary to read.\u201d Jerome K. Jerome, Three Men on the BummelRoger Zelazny knew how to write an exciting book that makes your imagination to go full throttle in minimal number of pages. Only true Masters possessed this ability. It feels almost like blasphemy to make long talks about such short and brilliant book, so I will shut up. Besides, I said everything I wanted about it."}, {"userName": "StoryTellerShannon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6773727-storytellershannon", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "\u2718\u2718 Sarah \u2718\u2718 (former Nefarious Breeder of Murderous Crustaceans)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7298986-sarah-former-nefarious-breeder-of-murderous-crustaceans", "userReview": "[ (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Markus", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26681101-markus", "userReview": "All roads lead to Amber..Nine brothers fight for the inheritance left behind by the disappearance of their father. The ultimate prize is the throne of Amber, the one real world, of which all other worlds are mere shadows and reflections.Nine Princes of the Amber is an interesting fantasy introduction with an intriguing concept. I really enjoyed reading the early parts, where the prince Corwin wakes up in a hospital on Earth with no memory of his past. I expected a more traditional fantasy when picking up this book, but instead got a story of Corwin and his companions travelling between worlds and attempting to reach Amber while also struggling to regain his memory and understanding of what\u2019s going on.This combination of science fiction and fantasy was pretty interesting, and made even more so by the fact that the protagonist himself, as a result of his amnesia, holds as little information as the reader to begin with about the world of Amber and how it works. Thus the reader is able to follow Corwin\u2019s journey and learn with him.Unfortunately, Zelazny\u2019s writing is not very good, at least not at this early stage. It seems to blend many different styles of writing, which often ruins the atmosphere of the story and the setting, and also contains a number of mistakes throughout the book. Additionally the simplicity of the plot and the shallowness of characterisation made the quality suffer slightly. However, these are all negatives that can be easily corrected in sequels, and I\u2019m ready to give dear Roger the benefit of doubt because of how intriguing the concept is.Overall, this is a very short and enjoyable introduction to one of the great fantasy series of the previous century."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "See my review under the one volume (omnibus) set...one of my favorite series. This is another classic that ought to be called a classic!Update:I read this one first...back when. It was in the 1970s. I have since grown a bit, aged quite a bit and...possibly even matured a little. I still love these books. I have also discovered audio books (this too happened some years ago and has been detailed elsewhere. My wife became very ill and was bed fast a long time, she also came to the point where she really couldn't read, so I began tracking down audio books for her. First I got books on cassette and later on CD. Since I had the books anyway I listened to them in my work vehicle).Since that time I have found I really like audio books and have often bemoaned that these books, the Amber Series were never done in audio.Well now it has been and as soon as Audible offered the books I began downloading them. The reader (of the first series) a voice actor named Allessandro Juliani does a good job and the story has drawn me in again as it did when I was young. Plot driven yet with a main character painted in bright detail these are (in my humble opinion) exceptional books(at least the first series) and I am very happy they are finally available in audio.Recommended in any form you care to read them, print book, Ebook or audio book I think most fantasy fans will truly enjoy them."}, {"userName": "Choko", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27962805-choko", "userReview": "*** 4 ***\n\"...\u201cI like libraries. It makes me feel comfortable and secure to have walls of words, beautiful and wise, all around me. I always feel better when I can see that there is something to hold back the shadows.\u201d ...\"\nNine Princes in Amber is the first installment in a series of 10 rather shortish books. They are divided into 2 arcs and the first one is told from Corwin\u2019s perspective, while the next set make his son's story the main event. Although we see the happenings from this family line's POV, the real center of both arcs is the internal struggle of the family to deal with their inherited familial need to dominate the others of their bloodline by any means possible - betrayal, treachery, backstabbing, all breaks of honor and what we consider human empathy in all circumstances, all in the battle to capture and keep their birthright, the Crown of Amber, once belonging to their father, Oberon, who is currently and has been for a very long time missing, presumed dead. Whoever ends up with the crown will have to dodge the treachery of all his siblings and their allies, while ruling Amber and trying to protect its people from problems starting to emerge from the Shadows and the forces of Chaos.\n\"...\u201cthere is Shadow and there is Substance, and this is the root of all things. Of Substance, there is only Amber, the real city, upon the real Earth, which contains everything. Of Shadow, there is an infinitude of things. Every possibility exists somewhere as a Shadow of the real.\u201d ...\"\nIn this volume we are introduced to Corwin, who awakens in a hospital after an apparent car \"accident\", heavily drugged and kept this way on purpose, with severe amnesia and no idea of who he is, where he is, and only with an insistent sense of danger and the knowledge he needs to get out of there. In the beginning of the book he has to figure out who he is, find a way to go some place safe, discover who his enemies are, get some allies, play an obviously dangerous game by bluffing his way through it, and once he finds out not only who he is but also what he is, he has to make some martial decisions which would have sweeping consequences for many, many people... But most of all, he has to confront his brother Eric and take the Crown. Turns out, because of Eric and his mental influence, Corwin has been stuck on Earth for centuries, having a real-life first hand knowledge of things like the plague, the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Napoleon, the life in concentration camps, and all the wars in between. As he starts to remember, he discovers that he is one of the nine princes of Amber, the only World which is Real and True, while all other worlds, including our Earth, are just shadows thrown by it. It is the only \"substance\" while all the rest are \"Shadows\"... The opposite and opposing entity to Amber is Chaos. And Chaos is starting an offensive on the g-d-like siblings of Amber. Are they going to get to a point where they will put their in-fighting to the side in order to protect the World? \n\"...\u201cI walked among Shadows, and found a race of furry creatures, dark and clawed and fanged, reasonably manlike, and about as intelligent as a freshman in the high school of your choice-sorry, kids, but what I mean is they were loyal, devoted, honest, and too easily screwed by bastards like me and my brother. I felt like the dee-jay of your choice.\u201d ...\"\nYep, those Amber G-ds sure are assholes!!! The siblings are all gifted with what to us is like super-powers, for them just part of their heritage. In most of the Shadow Worlds they are looked upon and worshiped as a pantheon of g-ds. The ones of The Blood are capable of traveling between the worlds by manipulating matter, adding and subtracting in a formula meant to solve for the destination they desire. I find this system absolutely fascinating and love the heck out of it. It is different, it is imaginative and very original, having in mind that the first book was created in the late 60's and published as a complete work in '71. It is a kind of a hybrid between Science Fiction and Fantasy and as every first work is not perfect, but it sure is entertaining. He does have all the female siblings as a second thought and females are not very present in the story, but I hope we get there eventually. What I love about this author the most is his ability to write in a minimalistic manner and short format, while packing every page with world-building and action. I have said before, he knows exactly the limits to keep us interested and never get bored!!! I can't wait to return and see what happens with the familial MMA cage match that is The Princes of Amber!!! \n\"...\u201cWhat an enormous chutzpah you possess,\" I told him. \"What makes you better than the rest of us, and more fit to rule?\" \"The fact that I was able to occupy the throne,\" he replied. \"Try and take it.\u201d ...\"\nNow I wish you All Happy Reading and may you always find what you Need in the pages of a Good Book!"}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31814285-daniel", "userReview": "Kada citam neke od ovih starijih knjiga prosto mi je tesko da poverujem da za ovih 40 godina nisu ostavljeni u prasini i da su pojedine (mnoge) knjige bolje od danasnjih.Ako uzmemo ovu knjizicu prosto je neverovatno da na svega 170tak strana imamu pricu dubine i tezine daleko vece nego mnoge epske knjige na 400 i vise strana.

Soon after that he realizes he's been drugged for days and flees the building, meanwhile collecting bits of informations about his former life.Within a few chapters he learns he's one of the nine living princes of Amber, the only true world (of which every other world is but a Shadow. Literally.) and that this makes him basically a god.These princes can, in fact, modify Shadow worlds with just a minor effort of will(but not Amber itself), travel freely between universes and do a number of other nifty things.The rest of the book covers, more or less, his struggles to regain his memories and win the throne of Amber itself, now held by Eric, one of his brothers.Too bad that, while having a great premise and being full of good ideas, the book fails (quite badly) to deliver.Its first and most obvious fault is that it's so very hasty: Corwin goes from \"I wake up without knowing who I am\" to \"I single-handedly wage war to decide the fate of all the universes\" in about 30 pages! It never takes time to build pathos or put some meat on the characters, and the result is that after a flying start the narration falls flat.The whole second half of the book is made almost entirely of battles resolved in one-line sentences.Just imagine a few dozen pages full of something like \"We went there to fight A. Three hundred died. Then we fought B. Then C came and we fled. Then we fought C and a two thousand died.\"Another big point is that this book does a lousy job of explaining things. Don't get me wrong I love books where you have to figure out things yourself, but here there's just a lot of random stuff thrown at you that you're supposed to take as a given.Why are the princes so powerful? What allows them to change reality? Why can they change some things and not others? Why on Earth do they all want Amber's throne? (since they could create an infinite number of worlds perfectly identical to it by simply wishing it) Why doesn't gunpowder burn in Amber? (while matches work perfectly instead) The list could go on and on and on. At times you are given pathetic explanations on the lines of \"Princes of Amber can change reality because they can\". Why thank you very much, Mr. Zelazny.Plot resolutions are often plain ridiculous and lack any logic. At some point in the book there's a battle on this loooong and narrow staircase climbing a mountain. These stairs are so narrow that only the two soldiers on the front can fight, and everyone else (we're talking a few thousands on each side) just stands there watching.No one takes a bow, nor throws a fucking rock for that matter.I'd write more about such plot holes but I don't want to make spoilers and I think I made my point already anyway. Last but not least, the language is a mix of archaic English and 70s slang. If ever there were any doubts that the two are not meant to go together, Nine princes in Amber wiped them away.Apart from being very VERY annoying, this quaint (for want of a better and non offensive word) linguistc mix makes absolutely no sense.Just think about it: our Earth is but one of an infinite number of Shadow world of which most characters (which, remember, are immortal gods) barely suspect the existence.. why the hell would they use American Idioms?? A couple times is mentioned how they are actually speaking Amber's language.. and I must say I'm really, really curious as to how does \"I dig thy stuff, brother\" translate in Amberian(can't remeber the actual name).The language is not the only part pervaded with random elements of American culture; the princes, for example,just can't help smoking about 20 packs of (branded) cigarettes per page. Where do they get them? No idea.I was constantly reminded of an uber-cheesy sci-fi movie from the 70s.It's not an entirely terrible book and it holds some very cool concepts, but I hardly find it deserving all the praise it gets."}, {"userName": "Ivana Books Are Magic", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56173179-ivana-books-are-magic", "userReview": "I remember, like it was yesterday, the moment I picked up this book in a library. Only it wasn't yesterday, it was about 15 years ago, but what is time when you're in love. I did fall in love with this series. Having read this book for the first time all that time ago, my initial reaction was a very favourable one. I thought this novel was absolutely mind-blowing. My thoughts today? They\u2019re pretty much the same, in all honesty I can say that my original impression never really changed. If anything, I\u2019ve grown to love this novel even more. While I was reading Nine Princes in Amber for the first time, I felt like something life-changing has just happened to me. Perhaps I was not mistaken. I remember telling everyone at some high-school part how cool this book is. They all seemed to agree with me as far as the coldness of the whole concept of shadowy words goes. I\u2019m not sure did I actually get anyone to read it, but it is never too late, right? That is why almost two decades later, I\u2019m writing this review. This is still one of my favourite fantasy series of all time.I love the genre mixing in this one, the way this novel opens as (an attempted) murder mystery and all of the sudden takes a turn towards fantasy is ingenious. Our protagonist Carl (who will later on discover his real name is Corwin) wakes us in a hospital, having no recollection of himself. His amnesia lasts for quite some time, making the events in the novel more mysterious and interesting. We\u2019re in there with him, struggling to make sense of things, trying to unravel the complexities of his situation. Corwin escapes the hospital without much ado and having found the address of his sister, gets to her home shortly. Corwin may have lost his memory but not his style. He relies on his instincts to get as much information out of his nervous sister Flora as he can. Corwin at the start of The Nine Princes in Amber reminds me on heroes of noir novel, he seems like a tough and resourceful kind of guy that, like a cat, always lands on his fit and lives to fight another day. However, very early in the story Corwin gets his rug pulled under his feet and all it takes is one word: Amber.I swear I could feel the hairs on my hands standing while I was reading about his initial reaction to this word and the funny thing is that in that this early in the story he (and we as readers) is totally clueless about what this word means, but as the mere mentioning of this word caused a storm in his head, he feels it must be an answer to all the questions he yet has to learn how to form. All roads lead into Amber. We won\u2019t learn what that means for a while. Yet, I could sense it must be something big. His strong reaction suggested as much and Corwin is depicted as someone whose instincts are right one. He intuitively knows that he is not to trust his siblings and that they might in fact be trying to kill him. Wasn\u2019t it a clever plot device to have a protagonist who is unaware of the fantasy elements in the story itself? The realization of the complexity of his world is something that he comes in terms with step at a time and in this way, we as readers, are saved from reading long explanations and descriptions. We\u2019re showed, rather than told- and some say this is indicative of good writing. While they might not always be the case, I dare say it is in this novel. Anyhow, soon after Corwin\u2019s \u2018not so warm\u2019 heart to heart talk with Flora, another character steps in the game. Random, his younger brother, true to his name, arrives out of the blue and brings trouble with him. The mystery of Amber is about to be told, but I won\u2019t speak about how it will happen, because I want to avoid spoilers. If you\u2019re thinking of reading this book, don\u2019t go on and read some synopsis that reveals the plot. Where is the fun in that? I know there is a good change you\u2019ve heard about it before. Even greater is the chance that having looked up the novel, you have had already came across the information, but just in case you didn\u2019t- don\u2019t read it. All you need to know is that you\u2019re in for a ride. The Nine Princes In Amber starts up as a crime novel, but it ends up being an amazing fantasy one with an awe-inspiring cast of characters. So, who are the nine princes in Amber? I won\u2019t tell you that. Are they well portrayed? They sure are. Are they about to do fantastic things? Yes, they will. There you go, it\u2019s all you need to know as readers. Instead of giving up too much information, let\u2019s just get back to talking about why and how this novel rocks. First of all, I thought the premise of the book was absolutely brillant. If I\u2019m not mistaken, at that particular point in time (seventies), parallel universes weren\u2019t really the thing. Sure, the parallel universes aren\u2019t something that is/was unheard of in fantasy, but the way this novel explored it was (and it still IS) something quite original. I\u2019m not sure that even today I can think of a novel that has managed to achieve something that feels this credible, this well plotted and constructed. There is something almost psychological about the way it explains parallel universities and often in my life (I did say it was life-changing and you see I didn\u2019t lie), I\u2019ve wondered how much are we the creators of our own reality, how much of what we see is just our projection and just how much of the world gets changed with our projection. Roger deserves to be praised for the power of his imagination. The idea behind this series is really something and the way it gets developed is truly wonderful, but I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.The second thing that I really love about this novel is protagonist, Corwin. His character development in this one is perfect. It is not by any means drastic (that is reserved for the sequels), in fact, it is so subtle you can almost miss it. The way amnesia affected Corwin\u2019s personality is fascinating. In a way he preserved his personality even when he lost his memory (and old soul one might say) and that was certainly showed in a convincing manner, yet this amnesia made him question not just everyone else but also first and foremost himself. The way he acts is the way he always acted but there is a worm of a doubt. Corwin is starting to question himself. What will come of it? If you\u2019re anything like me, by the time you finish this novel, you will surely be very eager to learn. I don\u2019t think I have ever had a crush on a literary character, but this one really got under my skin. He is still in there somewhere.Thirdly, the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree. If Corwin is a great character (and he is masterfully developed and portrayed), then trust that his family might be a subject of interest. On other words, leave it to his family to make the things a lot more interesting. This is a highly dysfunctional and Machiavellian family, but what a joy to read about them. Court and dagger sort of thing but done in Roger\u2019s style! Every sibling was as fascinating as the next one and among much cruelty, there is also sincere respect. They are who they are. Who they are isn\u2019t always pretty- most of the time, it is kind of disturbing. There are no classical good guys in this one, not even the protagonist himself- but if you\u2019re me, you\u2019ll see him in a good light.Finally, there is the language- pure poetry. This novel is absolutely lyrical. The way that lyricism clashes with Machiavellian politics creates quite an interesting contrast. The story is told from Corwin\u2019s point of view, so he as characters, thanks to his creator, sounds deviously charming and painfully eloquent pretty much all of the time. Not that I think of it, it must be why he is so darn loveable, even when he is\u2026. Well, read a see how that one might end. The style of writing is absolutely perfect for this novel because it gives it both its dreamy quality and its credibility (considering who Corwing is). Roger wrote this one beautifully and the sequels are not any different.That's basically it, my favourite things about this novel are: the setting (the very idea and premise of this story), Corwin (such an amazing character), Corwin\u2019s family (basically all the important characters in the novel) and the beautiful writing. Yes, that sums it up nicely! I\u2019m not sure why it took me more than 1500 words to say that. ;) I guess I was feeling like elaborating a bit on it.You know, I\u2019m seriously thinking of writing a review for every book of this series. Why not?

Zelazny is a super writer & this book started a series that has spawned a lot of other books. There are 4 other books that follow this one with Corwin as the hero, then Zelazny did another 5 about Corwin's son, Merlin. Gregory Betancourt is up to book 4 (let's hope the last, #5, gets published since the publisher folded) on Corwin's dad, Oberon. Some don't like Betancourt's books, but I think he's done a great job. A lot better than most of the novels others have finished for Zelazny. He's kept to the story line & a similar writing style.

But getting it is going to require real struggle, real sacrifice, and all-too-real pain. The first 50 pages of this book and the last 5 pages were absolutely brilliant 5-star storytelling. But everything in between? Sadly, not quite so much, for me, anyway. The rest of this book was a frustrating combination of vivid and inspired, but also dead boring. Too much time passes too quickly as Corwin, our hero, allies himself with various brothers, gathers armies from various Shadowlands, wages war on land and on sea, and eventually finds himself jailed. Years and years pass in a huge blur, during which time, as a reader, I connected with no one and felt no particular investment in the story. I couldn\u2019t care less about Amber or even Rebma, its undersea companion nation where the story spends a little more time. But then those last few pages? Breathtakingly ingenious and pure Zelazny. So I\u2019m in for at least the next volume, and trusting that maybe now it will get to a closer, more \u201creal\u201d story where I actually get to know and care about some of the characters, especially Corwin.

Unfortunately, since then, the Amber books have only been in print as one big doorstop edition -- not the type of thing my 8th graders would pick up to read readily.Imagine my eyes when my wife dragged me to an antique store here in Maine (OK, \"junk\" store) and I wandered into the used paperback books section and found 8 out of the 10 original paperbacks, all at $2 each. Whoa! I bought them ipso fasto and then went to Barnes & Nobles on-line to find sellers who would have the remaining two. These cost me more due to the $3.99 shipping and handling (a.k.a. \"highway and robbery\"), but it was worth it to have the whole set in paperback form to add to my classroom library (where, no doubt, some of them will be lost or stolen this year... sob).Anyway, I decided to reread the first book in the series -- Nine Princes in Amber -- so I could book talk the entire series to my class this September. Amazingly, it held up over time. About the only 70s hangover (it was originally published in 1970) it suffers is the characters' constant lighting up of cigarettes and downing of drinks (wait, that still applies -- and it's not like cigarettes are going the way of the Edsel, either).I think it's a classic in its genre if only for the imagination that went behind the worlds Zelazny created (Amber, the Forest of Arden, Remba, etc.). I know the aficionados all say his Lord of Light is the classic, but that was more onerous to me. This one's a STORY. It's got plot. It's got nine brothers at each other's throats for the throne, each constantly changing alliances with the other for self-gain. And Corwin is just tough-guy fun to be around.I also love the concept of each prince (and princess -- as there are six of those as well) being a face card as a trump in decks carried by each of them. If you're in a tight spot and they are reachable, you can try to contact one by looking at the card. Sometimes the card will come to life and you can communicate, reaching a hand to it and thus being pulled to wherever that brother or sister happens to be.OK, so it appeals to the fantasy kid in me. Its medieval intrigues recast into the 20th century shows psychology as well as brute force at its Machiavellian best. The question is, will the 21st-century kids like it? I'll report back in the fall...."}, {"userName": "Nandakishore Varma", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma", "userReview": "There must be some bad chemistry between Roger Zelazny and I. I read his award-winning novel Lord of Light and was seriously underwhelmed. I explained why in my review, but still got pasted for bad-mouthing an American classic from an Indian viewpoint. Anyone interested in seeing the roasting I got can visit the comment thread on my review of that book.I thought well, maybe I have been less than fair: this gentleman being one of the greats in the field of SF and fantasy, I should give him another chance - and picked this book up from the library. No luck! I ended up being disappointed again, less so than before maybe because my expectations were lesser.The story as such is pretty simple. There are nine princely brothers who want to rule the kingdom of Amber (which is the only real realm, all others - including our earth - being shadows of it), and our first-person protagonist Corwyn is one of them. The problem is, currently power is held by Eric, another prince, who doesn't want to let go. So what happens when many people want a single seat of power happens in this novel too - war, murder and mayhem.The story starts abruptly with Corwyn trapped in our world without a memory. How he escapes from his confinement in a hospital and manages to reach Amber with the help of another brother Random is told entertainingly. The action moves at breakneck speed - to quote Stephen King, \"the goofy speed of a silent film\" - and is quite entertaining. However, once they reach Amber it becomes more of traditional fantasy fare, though still enjoyable.There are a lot of exciting fantasy devices - the Tarot pack which the princes use for communication; the Pattern where Corwyn regains his memory, in the undersea kingdom of Rebma, which is a mirror image of Amber; the fight on the endless stairs to the city - but it all felt too skeletal for me, like the outline for a novel. I am not a fan of large tomes, but in this case, I felt the novel would have benefited from a bit of fleshing out.Sorry, Mr. Zelazny, I think I am not the ideal reader for your novels."}, {"userName": "Kat  Hooper", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2177891-kat-hooper", "userReview": "Originally Posted at FanLit.\u201cI\u2019d get what I needed and take what I wanted and I\u2019d remember those who helped me and step on the rest. For this, I knew, was the law by which our family lived, and I was a true son of my father.\u201dWhen Corwin wakes up in a private hospital after driving his car over a cliff, he has no idea who he is. When he realizes that he has healed too fast and that he\u2019s being drugged so he\u2019ll stay unconscious, he decides that he better find out what\u2019s going on.The truth is strange: Corwin is one of the nine princes of Amber, the one true world, but for centuries he\u2019s been exiled in the Shadowland we call Earth. The accident has actually dislodged the spell that his brother Eric was using to keep him out of Amber because Corwin is the biggest threat to Eric\u2019s sovereignty there.Nine Princes in Amber is the first (rather short) installment in a long epic that describes, from Corwin\u2019s perspective and later his son\u2019s, the struggle of his family to deal with both their internal treacheries and the evil forces that assail them from the forces of Chaos. In Nine Princes in Amber, Corwin must figure out who he is, assess his resources, gather some allies, wonder whether his father is dead or alive, and make a move on the throne of Amber. Here we learn what Corwin has been doing for centuries on Earth, meet several of his siblings, discover the way in and out of Amber, meet a race of people who live under the sea, and discover some of the special powers of Corwin\u2019s family.Ah\u2026 Corwin\u2019s family\u2026 if you can call them a \u201cfamily.\u201d Corwin\u2019s own description for them is \u201cMachiavellian,\u201d and that about covers it. Corwin and his brothers and sisters are clever, sophisticated, sarcastic, and extremely ambitious. They constantly scheme and plot to outmaneuver each other as they vie for political power. If you knew these people in real life, you\u2019d probably hate them, but in Zelazny\u2019s hands they\u2019re kind of charming. These are people who plan to live forever, have the ability to design their own worlds to plunder, are incapable of trust, and have no reason to think about anyone other than themselves. In the end, Corwin rages against his brother and makes a rash decision that will negatively affect Amber\u2019s future.THE CHRONICLES OF AMBER was highly imaginative when it was published in the 1970s and it remains fresh and original today. The magic system is creative, Zelazny\u2019s writing style is solid, the story is fast-paced, exciting, and mature. Plot twists and cliffhangers make it hard to stop reading. You\u2019ll definitely want to have The Guns of Avalon, the second book in the series, ready to go as soon as you finish Nine Princes in Amber.Nine Princes in Amber is a re-read for me because Audible Frontiers has recently produced THE CHRONICLES OF AMBER on audio \u2014 something I have been waiting years for. They\u2019ve chosen one of their best narrators for Zelazny\u2019s most famous work: Alessandro Juliani. He\u2019s got the perfect voice and style to play Corwin, so I\u2019m really pleased with this production.

If a Bookshelf/tag was ever a perfect description, then 'oldschool scifi' is it.A solid 3.5 stars, (I wonder why GR has refused to listen for all these years on half star ratings?)This is the second read of this story for me. The first was over 25 years ago and was when I was just getting into fantasy. I kind of liked it, but rushed through it and never picked up book 2. To be honest, I can't actually remember finishing it, so it was probably a dnf. My second read through, found me older, wiser, relaxed in my new reading chair with a glass of red wine and thankful that committing to my first group read in over a year was only a 117 pages long. A perfect way to get back into social reading and the crew I read with are very social :)Back to the book, since this is supposed to be a review. Zelazny's writing is quite unique, he manages to tell a story with considerably less words than anyone I know. Talk about not fleshing out the story with wordy sentences (looking at you China Meiville). He manages to pack into just over 100 pages a story with enough back story to not make you feel Malazanish, enough character build to clearly define the main characters, some drip feed magic to keep you guessing and a hint at a much bigger plot. Some scenes are very very short and that is different, I am used to big drawn out battles with descriptions of arm muscles being torn and wrenched till they pop etc. In amber it is more like 'he rode straight at me on his horse, sword aloft, I stepped inside his arm and pulled him off. I won'. Simple, effective and time to move on.You do really need to read with book 2, commit to 250 pages. I think a lot of people, the younger me included, probably feel there wasn't enough in the first book, but I am confident that after reading the fist 5 pages of book 2, that the story is going to unfold before us, in a deliciously old fashioned way."}, {"userName": "Logan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3420149-logan", "userReview": "I hate, hate, HATED this book. I hate this series, but at least the other books are better than this horrendous beginning.Nothing in this book makes any sense. The system of magic (if there is one) has no parameters or rules--one minute the prince can travel between worlds in a car that he can also change around at will, the next he can't do anything, the next he's walking through doors drawn in the walls, the next he's doing something else weird and nonsensical. The only motive anyone has in this book is a loosely-defined desire for the throne of Amber, which is the only real world in existence. There are nine princes and, I think, some princesses, and some of them are dead, and one of them has the throne but the main character (another prince with highly selective amnesia) wants it. The dialogue in this book is patently ridiculous, but it improves in sequels. The characters seem to alternate between \"old-ish\" English (I can't really elaborate on this) and modern talk, even going so far as to incorporate slang. As I said before, magic in this book is vague. It is used as a deus ex machina several times (main character in trouble, new character shows up with special magic trick to bail him out, new character disappears forever) but with no consistency; one day the character(s) can alter the fabric of reality itself and the next day they can't do anything useful. There are no rules to the magic except when rules are convenient to move the plot.Again, the sequels improve on all of these, but not enough for me to enjoy this series, and especially this terrible, extremely highly overrated book."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35415186-ryan", "userReview": "The Good:Zelazny\u2019s writing is brilliant.

The setting here is the \u2018Amberverse\u2019 (I\u2019m sure there is a better or at least more official name for it) and our own universe is a very small part of it. The kind of magic at work in this setting is the type that allows immensely powerful people to warp reality with their thoughts, yet still allows them to have car accidents and get beaten up by a bunch of regular thugs. Somehow it works. I loved the protagonist too.The Bad:It isn\u2019t confusing so much as very opaque. This is a fantasy story, with ubiquitous magic, so whether or not a problem can be solved with a snap of the fingers is obviously a matter of author fiat. This requires constant exposition to keep the reader in the loop. I found it interruptive. In the hands of a less skilled writer I think it would have been unbearable.'Friends' character the protagonist is most like:Corwin is an everyday bloke who just happens to be heir to the shining pinnacle of reality.

Since then, I've been having three parallel discussions with my wife, Jordan and notgettingenough about what it is that makes something into a trash novel. Three out of the four of us incline to the view that it's the quality of being mass-produced; a trash novel is one that has been hastily constructed according to an existing formula, with a minimum of independent thought. In practice, this means that most trash novels are genre fiction, since formulas typically belong to a specific genre. Notgettingenough, the outlier, is reluctant to accept that the label 'trash novel' has any meaning. She argues that some generally accepted masterpieces were produced quickly, and that an author of sufficient talent can turn out something in a few weeks which is better than a 'literary' novel that might have taken years to write. True, but I would say these cases are rare, and don't invalidate the basic argument. They mainly show that some people are far more gifted than others.But there are certainly books and authors that lurk uneasily in the no-mans-land around Trashville proper. Zelazny's Amber series comes to mind. This book, the first one, is IMHO a good, original fantasy/SF novel. It's exciting, quite well-written, and contains a bunch of ingenious ideas. (Those magic packs of cards! The fight on the Endless Stair!) But, as the series progressed, I thought it got more tired and stale with each book that appeared, and I would, alas, have to classify the last ones as formulaic trash. Zelazny was no longer creating, just recombining, and it became horribly like listening to a group of D&D players discussing the week's happenings in their current game.I wonder what this example shows? Perhaps any novel, or indeed any work of art, turns into trash into if it's copied enough times, or copied with sufficient lack of skill. The funny thing is that it can happen even when the person doing the copying is the one who wrote the original template."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9595345-lisa", "userReview": "Full Review at Tenacious Reader: http://www.tenaciousreader.com/2016/1...I was incredibly impressed by how well this book has aged. It is a portal fantasy, so parts of it are set in the \u201cmodern\u201d day we know, but with the exception of the absence of current technology and a few references to hippies, I could not have told you when it was written. It still feels very modern even though its 40+ years old.The story begins with Corwin, who has woken in a hospital and seems to be suffering from amnesia. Now, I have read a number of books that start with amnesia, that have decidedly not worked well for me. I am happy to say this one actually did.As Corwin learns and remembers more, we discover alternate worlds and in particular, we learn about Amber, the ultimate world. The world that seems hardest to reach, but also the most critical to return to. In this book, I felt the relaying of information and world building worked extremely well. We got relevant information as Corwin would come across it in one way or another, and it just felt natural. Following his journey, meeting his companions, and learning about this world, discovering how Corwin came to wake up in that hospital all made this an enjoyable reading experience.For me, perhaps the most telling aspect of this book that hints at its age is the length (or lack there of). I feel like I have read recent novellas that were longer than this novel. And for this reason, there is still much to know and learn.

It makes me feel comfortable and secure to have walls of words, beautiful and wise, all around me. I always feel better when I can see that there is something to hold back the shadows.\u201dNine Princes in Amber is the first book in the Chronicles of Amber series. My initial reaction to the novel is a positive one, as it reflects upon the better aspects of pulp fantasy fiction from the 1970s and beyond. In many ways I feel that this novel is what Michael Moorcock was aiming to create with his Elric novels and yet I feel as if Zelazny succeeded much better at creating a book which reflects a mixture of strange magic and human appeal. The Prince Corwin, awakes at the beginning of this novel to find himself in a hospital where he has been kept sedated for two weeks. Unfortunately he remembers almost nothing about his past life and why he has been placed in the hospital. He discovers quickly however that he does not belong on Earth (where he has found himself) but is a member of a proud and arrogant bloodline that considers itself superior. He is a member of the house of Amber, the real world from which all other worlds are constructed in the Shadow as mere copies and imitations. And so of course Corwin discovers quickly that he is a part of a battle for the abandoned throne of Amber and must fight for that throne.The concept of one world being the true one and all others being copies is an interesting one to me. Alongside the other magical idea of having a race of beings who can manipulate these other worlds in their own ways I was fascinated by this. In essence our main character is a kind of godly being, only with some of the limitations of a mortal and forced to fight for his very survival. The one negative to this novel is that, like many other fantasy novels, women have been depicted in a way that suits the author's intentions for his male characters. In other words they are absent or removed from the real aspects of the plot. The few female characters that did appear served to exist as Corwin's lovers or his sisters (whom he used to hide from his brother). However, I do not feel this necessarily an indictment on Zelazny yet, as I have not read anything else by him to this point. It may be more a reflection on the arrogance and brutality of his protagonists and antagonists.Is Nine Princes in Amber a decent novel then? I would admit to it being a beyond decent novel. With its magic, its brevity and its overall enigmatic charm it was a book that ticked many of the boxes of what I appreciate in fiction. I almost forgot to mention the subtlety of the humour, which tied in nicely into the ways Zelazny showed events unfolding. Of course, the prose is nothing to praise in particular (this is a pulp fantasy work) but by stripping his prose of too many distracting elements Zelazny capably focused his novel around the unfolding action and the likeability and distastefulness of the characters. That, in my eyes, is solid writing."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "One of my favorite stories, written & narrated by one of my favorite authors, so I thought I'd love it.
