Face it Baldacci fans, you're used to reading his books that have 500-ish pages.Like usual, the author pulled the fat out of the fire just when things were getting noticeably boring. I felt despaired. Fortunately things improved just when I had abandoned all hopes of a return to form.The Fix is perhaps the only Baldacci book where a cruel death is averted at the end. Well things are feisty right from the start. But not at the end. Maybe the author has received feedback not to kill off his most cherished characters. The book didn't suffer for it though. After a little hesitation, I give this book 4 stars. There are few better and far worse thrillers out there."}, {"userName": "Alex is The Romance Fox", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6663962-alex-is-the-romance-fox", "userReview": "The Fix is the 3rd book in the Amos Decker series by David Baldacci. Amos Decker and his team are faced with a baffling new case. Walking past the FBI's Hoover Building, Decker witnesses a man shooting a woman dead right in front of the building's entrance before killing himself. Investigations seem to be leading nowhere...at first, there seems to be no connection between the two people but soon Decker, with his memory talents, discovers a plot filled with betrayals, family secrets and a lot more than span over a lifetime.The story did start becoming a bit slow and drawn out towards the middle but it draws to the most unexpected and shocking ending that made it worthwhile finishing.Although you can read this book as a standalone, I recommend you read the first two books....Memory Man and The Last Mile....you can read my reviews here ... https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2... ....to get a better understanding of how Amos Decker began his new career.A good an solid addition to the series but not as good as the 1st two."}, {"userName": "Mary Beth *Traveling Sister*", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14233569-mary-beth-traveling-sister", "userReview": "This is the third book in the Amos Decker Series. I loved the first two books in this series and when I got this from Overdrive I was so excited. I listened to the audiobook. Ugh!!! Only to be left in utter disappointment. I felt like this was written by another author. It was so different than the first two books. I am a fan of this author and he never disappointed me. If you are a fan of spy and espionage thrillers, I think you will love this one. I wouldn't really call it a thriller but more of a slow moving mystery. This book can be read as a stand alone if you don't like to read a series. I loved the beginning but then in the middle it went flat. It took me seven days to read this book. Lucky I was reading it with other great books. I love twists and it didn't even have any and if it did, I must of missed it. Now will I read the rest of his series? Of course I will because I loved the first two books!Amos Decker witnesses a murder just in front of the FBI headquarters. Walter Dabney shoots a woman on a crowded sidewalk, then shoots and kills himself. This is not a spoiler since it happens in the very beginning. Then Amos Decker and his team tries to solve this case. Some of the questions that are asked is Why would Dabney kill a woman in front of the FBI Head Quarters on a crowded street? Why did he kill himself? The rest of the book mainlygoes on and on trying to answer these questions. It was a slow moving mystery and lacked the suspense for me.This is a spy and espionage mystery and I am not a big fanof those kind of books so if you like these kind of mysteries I really think you will like it a lot.My rating: 2.5 rounded to 3 stars."}, {"userName": "*TANYA*", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29049556-tanya", "userReview": "Amos Decker is officially one of my favorite book characters, ever!!

He then turns the gun on himself. It's clear that Dabney murdered Anne Berkshire, a substitute school teacher, but what's not so clear is the why. Since Decker witnessed the event and the case is handed to the FBI, the task force is given the assignment. Unlike the first two books, the task force is investigating a hot case instead of a cold one. It's classic police procedural with Decker's added unique skills. As it progresses, the investigation runs smack into another of the alphabet agencies, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and Harper Brown, their liaison. It was a gnarly puzzle, leading down unexpected and surprising paths. I ended up suspecting quite a few from time to time but ended up going with my initial instincts, which were right. I loved that the clues were all there for me to deduce much of it on my own (along with a lot of help from Decker).What I truly loved about this book was the relationship elements. Decker is experiencing the benefits of being part of a team after the circumstances of his tragic past and it humanizes him and the story. It makes quite a difference in a good way. Also, the duality narration has found its rhythm and it rocked. Kyf Brewer and Orlagh Cassidy made this a very enjoyable listening experience. Still loving this series and Amos Decker. This story might not have all excitement of the first two but it certainly strains the brain in figuring out the mystery.(I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review)"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1176005-amy", "userReview": "If this had been any other author, I never would have bothered finishing this.

You don't have to read the previous books to enjoy this one. Personally, haven't I read the first book yet (although I'm eyeing right now since it's on my desk waiting to be read).Amos Decker and his team have a new case, a man shoots and kills a woman outside FBI headquarters and then he shoots himself. But why? The man and the woman have no connection to each other and no one can understand why he did it. This is a strange case that soon gets even stranger when Harper Brown, an agent of the Defense Intelligence Agency gets involved with the case, first trying to get Amos to back down and then more and less helping them.As usual, has Baldacci written an interesting thriller. What I love about this book not only the strange case, but small things like Marvin Mars showing up in the story and Decker and Jamison moving in together as roommates in a building that Mars bought. Just roommates, they are just friends, although Jamison seems sometimes a bit \"fond\" of Decker. However, Decker is not a man that's ready to move on from the tragic murder of his wife and daughter especially since with his extraordinary memory never can forget the sight of finding them. What he needs is friends and that's what he got in Mars and Jamison.I liked how weird this case is, how they slowly had to unravel it to find out the motive for the killing. Did I see the ending coming? Partly to be honest. I was not totally surprised by the twist towards the end when we learn just how everything is connected. Sometimes, the answer is in front of your eyes all the time and I have read so many thrillers that I felt it was quite obvious who the person behind it all was. That doesn't mean that I did not enjoy reading the book, but some twist were just a bit too obvious...I want to thank the publisher for providing me with a free copy for an honest review!"}, {"userName": "The Real Book Spy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27296687-the-real-book-spy", "userReview": "Read this review and more at www.TheRealBookSpy.com Following the events of last year\u2019s The Last Mile, newly-hired FBI agent Amos Decker returns for his third outing in David Baldacci\u2019s The Fix.Amos Decker is not your average FBI agent. His size is the first thing that stands out, as Decker\u2013a massive, hulk-like figure\u2013still has the frame and body size that carried him to the NFL, where an injury ended his playing days.The career-ending injury he suffered, though, caused some rare side effects. The crunching helmet-to-helmet blow induced both hyperthymesia and synesthesia, fancy words that mean Decker cannot forget anything at all, ever. Oh, and it\u2019s changed the way he sees colors.After a career as a police detective, a very personal case he worked on caught the eye of some people who made Decker an offer to use his unique skills and abilities to solve cold cases for the FBI as part of a newly-formed special task force. He accepted the job and took on his first case in The Last Mile, but this time he\u2019s thrust into a murder investigation that even he can\u2019t see any reason or motive for.While walking down the sidewalk towards the FBI headquarters, Decker decided against stopping for a breakfast burrito and happened to return his gaze forward just in time to see a man pull a compact Beretta from his pocket and shoot a woman in the back of her head. Pulling his own firearm, Decker runs forward but is unable to do anything other than watch helplessly as the gunman turns his weapon on himself and pulls the trigger one final time.The shooter was eventually identified as Walter Dabney, a former employee of the NSA who has since been working as a contractor with several government agencies, including the FBI. However, Decker and his team are unable to find any link between Dabney and the victim, Anne Meredith Berkshire, a substitute teacher who lived alone and had no close family members. An early working theory is that Dabney, who they confirmed was scheduled for a meeting inside the Hoover Building that morning, went off the deep end and decided to take a random person down with him.Decker pokes numerous holes in the initial theory and begins searching for additional answers through his own unique methods. At the top of his list of unanswered questions is how a woman who makes a living as a substitute teacher is able to live in a three million dollar condo and drive a new Mercedes. More questions pop up when the team digs into Berkshire\u2019s background and struggle to find anything on her beyond the last decade.Just as the investigation heats up, Harper Brown, a no-nonsense DIA agent, requests a meeting with Decker and his boss, where she informs them that the murder is part of an ongoing investigation by the Defense Intelligence Agency and that they no longer need to spend any resources trying to solve the case themselves.When pressed, Brown says that the murder is now a matter of national security, involving a scenario that could be bigger than 9/11.Forgetting about a case and moving on isn\u2019t what Decker does. In fact, it\u2019s impossible for him. So, ignoring Brown\u2019s orders, Decker and his team keep working the case and eventually uncover a massive conspiracy that quickly becomes much bigger than anything Amos Decker has tackled before.David Baldacci, with more than 110 million copies of his books in print around the world, has finally hit his stride with this series. While Memory Man< flashed potential and The Last Mile was a solid thriller, The Fix is without question the best Decker novel yet. While the story starts out with the feel of a crime or mystery novel, it suddenly turns into a high-octane political thriller filled with enough lies, conspiracy, and espionage to keep fans of both genres happy.

The hyperthymesia gives Decker a permanent detailed memory of everything he's ever seen or experienced - like a combination photo album/video in his head. And the synesthesia makes Decker see things in false colors - like death scenes glowing blue. Unfortunately, Decker's hyperthymesia doesn't allow him to dim the memories of his dead wife and child, who were murdered a few years ago. On the upside, Decker's phenomenal memory helped him in his career as a police detective, and he now works for the FBI.....on a team that investigates crimes. Decker's FBI partner is Alex Jamison, a woman who understands his problems and has his back. Decker is on his way to a meeting in the FBI's Hoover Building in Washington DC when he sees a man shoot a woman in the head, then turn the gun on himself. The killer is identified as Walter Dabney, a former employee of the National Security Agency (NSA) who now consults with various government agencies, including the FBI. And the dead woman is identified as Anne Berkshire, a substitute teacher at a Catholic school and a volunteer for a local hospice. At first, the crime seems inexplicable since Dabney is a successful, happily married man with four grown daughters. As Decker's team investigates, though, they learn that Dabney had an inoperable brain tumor and an aneurysm, which would have killed him within months. Moreover, Dabney recently paid 10 million dollars to cover a huge gambling debt. As for Berkshire, she seems to be an enigma. Despite having a modest salary, the teacher owned a multimillion dollar condominium and a very expensive Mercedes. On top of that, Berkshire's searchable past ends ten years ago, beyond which there is no record of her. Dabney's wife and daughters are unable to provide any information about the tragedy. They're grief stricken by Dabney's death and flummoxed by the gambling obligation. Or are they? Things are more complicated than they seem, and get even more obscure when another murder occurs. Decker's team is in the midst of investigating the Dabney murder/suicide when Agent Harper Brown from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) waltzes in, says she's taking over the case for national security reasons, and demands all the FBI's files. Of course Decker isn't about to let his case get hijacked, and continues to make inquiries - raking his prodigious memory for relevant clues. The DIA and FBI end up working together, which works out well all around. To reveal more about the mystery would give away spoilers, so I'll just say the story has lots of twists, Decker and Jamison run up against some extremely dangerous people, and the book has a dramatic climax.A secondary thread of the story involves Decker and Jamison becoming apartment mates and building managers in a run-down edifice recently purchased by Melvin Mars - a man they helped in a previous book. Melvin plans to upgrade the tenement to provide nice apartments for low-income families. As residents of the old building, Decker and Jamison become acquainted with a tenant named Tomas Amaya and his eleven-year-old son Danny. Amaya is on the outs with neighborhood gangbangers, and Decker's interference in the situation leads to grave danger for himself and Jamison. This secondary plot introduces a second set of 'bad guys', which led to some confusion (for me) about which criminals did what. For romance fans, there's a budding love story in the novel, which leads to friction between the female characters.....but not for the reasons you might think. There's also an interesting theme about the damage caused by sports-enhancement drugs, which I found intriguing. All in all, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to fans of thrillers.You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."}, {"userName": "Beth Stothard", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64261508-beth-stothard", "userReview": "The first 2 books in this series were inspired and I was totally expecting the 3rd to continue that standard.

While walking outside the FBI's Hoover Building, Amos Decker witnesses a woman shot in apparent cold blood before the shooter turns the gun on himself. With the environs in shock, Decker uses his eidetic memory to capture the scene before reporting to his FBI Task Force. Usually handed cold cases, the team turns its attention to the murder of Anne Berkshire at the hands of one Walter Dabney. What might have led Dabney to gun down a substitute teacher who volunteered at the local hospice? It is only when they dig further that the extent to Dabney's problems arise. Formerly employed with the NSA, Dabney appears to have amassed much debt and has been borrowing to pay it off? That being said, Decker is left confused when the DIA (Defence Intelligency Agency) begins poking around and tries to take control of the investigation. Using his synesthesia and hyperthymesia, Decker is able to help the team explore deeper motives and potential witnesses, which open new avenues of investigation. With no clear backstory on Anne Berkshire, might she have been hiding from a less than stellar past? Could Dabney's attack on her could be the tip of something larger and much more sinister? In D.C., nothing is as it seems, leaving Decker to hope he can get to the root cause and bring closure to the Dabney family, whose shock grows with each new piece of information. Well paced and sure to keep most Baldacci fans pleased until the final page-turn. I have long been a Baldacci fan and find myself still hooked after this novel. Amos Decker stands alone when compared to other thriller protagonists on the market today, making the series novels highly interesting and entertaining. Baldacci has brought another wonderful plot to the forefront and spun a tale that keeps the reader on their toes, while also injecting the perfect number of twists. Steeped in political struggles of the day, Baldacci turns to a mix of the Middle Eastern and neo-Cold War clashes, without instilling too many stereotypes within each chapter. Strong returning characters provide the reader with a foundation on which to base their expectations, permitting growth and sideways development. While Decker's backstory has been revealed in the previous two novels, there are moments of reflection that provide new insight for the reader. Peppering new characters and leaving the door open for their return again allows Baldacci to offer great subplots, injecting humour into what is normally a darker subject. All those who grace the pages of the book can stand well on their own and mesh well with some Decker's quirks, paving the way for a great story that can be devoured in short order. Baldacci continues to shine in a genre that has long been supersaturated, though I will admit this was not his absolute best work. I have seen some fans who have shared a less than exuberant sentiment when they completed the novel. One might posit their issue is rooted in the lack of synesthesia-based writing, which left them a sense of being cheated. However, I cannot speak for them or their personal struggles with the story. There is always room for improvement and Baldacci shows that he, too, is fallible.Kudos, Mr. Baldacci for keeping the series strong and the stories sharp. I look forward to each new book you have and can assure you that I remain a fervent fan of all your work. Like/hate the review?

David Baldacci is by far my most read male author. I've enjoyed his books. I can't say, though, that I'm enjoying this particular series. It is probably my least favorite. There were parts of this that felt like 4 stars for me, and other parts that had me rolling my eyes. So I'll settle for 3 stars. What I like the most about his stories in general are the intricate story lines. He can weave a creative story with lots of bends in the road. This one had that. I also like the characters. I like that the MC isn't the standard cliche for this genre.I think where I struggled was that his brain injury doesn't translate well into the believable realm. The dialogue was the most painful for me. It was stiff and awkward. I get that some of it was purposely written to fit the MC and his brain injury, but it wasn't consistent. His character traits were all over the place. The second thing was how miraculously the MC could pull the answers out of thin air. It was like an Easter egg hunt and Amos was the only one who could see them.

Amos Decker does his Rainman stuff - awesome deductions coupled with being mildly sociopathic. The rest of the team also contribute in their own way. The story has multiple layers (like an onion and Shrek); with every mystery being solved, there are a couple more which come out into the open. The pacing is great.

The case seems closed to most as a man shot a woman dead then killed himself. Amos thinks more is involved and works to figure out why it happened."}, {"userName": "Kimba Tichenor", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18772957-kimba-tichenor", "userReview": "3.5 stars. Most likely I would have enjoyed this book more if I had read the two previous books in the series, as it took me a bit to catch on to the main character's back story (Amos Decker's wife and two children were murdered in Ohio and he at some point suffered a head injury that left him with a photographic memory and an inability to connect with people very well emotionally. Apparently for some time after his family's murder, he was also homeless). In this book, he is starting a new career as an investigator affiliated with the FBI. His initial assignment was to help the FBI solve cold cases, but when he witnesses a murder right in front of FBI headquarters in Washington DC, he is assigned to the case. The murder turns out to be connected with an international spy ring. I will stop there as I do not like to give away plot details for this type of book.I did think that the book started very slow and that the overall pace of the book was very uneven -- largely because some of the secondary plot lines did not work well and so rather than adding complexity, they merely slowed down the main story at inopportune moments. That said, these flaws were not so distracting that I would not be willing to try another book in this series."}, {"userName": "David Berkowitz", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41442383-david-berkowitz", "userReview": "I was hooked on the Amos Decker series from the first book, Memory Man. The third entry in the series, The Fix, is another great read. But truthfully, it isn't as strong as the first two entries. On the plus side, there is much more exploration of both Decker and Jamieson as characters. While there isn't much more given to the back stories there is a lot of time spent exploring who they are today and it's great to watch that relationship develop. On the downside, the plot is very cumbersome. While the final reveals seem plausible, the logic that leads Decker and company there stretches credulity. It's rather like the Sherlock Holmes idea that after you eliminate the impossible, whatever is left, regardless of it's improbability, must be the truth. In my opinion, the story contains too many of these types of intuitive leaps. But I'm willing to overlook that because I have really come to like these characters. I hope Baldacci has more Amos Decker on the drawing boards. Recommended to those who like thrillers with strongly drawn characters. While this works fine as a stand alone novel, you will enjoy it more if you have read both Memory Man and The Last Mile."}], "description": "David Baldacci's remarkable detective Amos Decker - the man who can forget nothing - was first introduced in the sensational number-one New York Times best seller Memory Man. Now Decker returns in a stunning new novel.... The Fix Amos Decker witnesses a murder just outside FBI headquarters. A man shoots a woman execution style on a crowded sidewalk, then turns the gun on himself. Even with Decker's extraordinary powers of observation and deduction, the killing is baffling. Decker and his team can find absolutely no connection between the shooter - a family man with a successful consulting business - and his victim, a schoolteacher. Nor is there a hint of any possible motive for the attack. Enter Harper Brown. An agent of the Defense Intelligence Agency, she orders Decker to back off the case. The murder is part of an open DIA investigation, one so classified that Decker and his team aren't cleared for it. But they learn that the DIA believes solving the murder is now a matter of urgent national security. Critical information may have been leaked to a hostile government - or, worse, an international terrorist group - and an attack may be imminent. Decker's never been one to follow the rules, especially with the stakes so high. Forced into an uneasy alliance with Agent Brown, Decker remains laser focused on only one goal: solving the case before it's too late. \u00a92017 David Baldacci (P)2017 Hachette Audio", "title": "The Fix\n      \n          (Amos Decker #3)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32608569-the-fix", "average": 4.18, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1486409439l/32608569.jpg", "reviews": 2209, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9291.David_Baldacci", "name": "David Baldacci"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Thriller", "Fiction", "Suspense"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32608569-the-fix", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31423137-the-fix", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31562247-the-fix", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31423485-the-fix", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31423480-the-fix", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15159.Absolute_Power", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15158.The_Camel_Club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12849385-the-innocent", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23153154-memory-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11007587-zero-day"]}
