The world (at large) knows of it as the Israeli Independence Day. But the Palestinians call it by another name: Yawm-an Nakba (\"Day of Catastrophe\") - for what name is more fitting for a day when daylight robbery was legitimised?It is true that history is always written by the victors. So the \"heroes\" always win, and the \"villains\" always get defeated. This is the story we hear. But what about the narrative of the defeated? Who are the heroes and villains in that tale?The formation of Israel is one of the most romanticised historic events, more so in the West. The tale of a homeless people, wandering around for centuries, endlessly persecuted, ultimately almost wiped out in the most horrific incident of planned and scientific genocide known in history; finally returning back to their mythic homeland and carving out a nation for themselves in the midst of hostile neighbours is the stuff of mythical sagas. What is sad is, the other side of this story, the tale of a people uprooted from their homeland and thrown out to become the flotsam of the modern world is largely unknown on misunderstood.Yes, I am talking about the Palestinians. Those crazed terrorists as depicted in Western media, who take pleasure in killing women and angelic Israeli children. A race which has been so marginalised and demonised that they have lost all common decency accorded to human beings, and are on the way to becoming a footnote people in history.It is in this context that I believe books like In Search of Fatima by Dr. Ghada Karmi becomes relevant. Because she gives a face to these \"terrorist demons\". And we find with a shock that it is a human face, not very different from ours.HistoryThe country called \"Palestine\" has never existed as a sovereign state (but then, never has Israel). \"Palestine\" is more a name of an area than a country. The birthplace of three of the world's biggest religions, the area has been claimed exclusively by all three (although Christianity has relinquished its exclusive rights recently, I think). And it has resulted in contests and counter-conquests to capture the holiest of all holy cities - Jerusalem.Palestine and the nearby areas had been under the rule of the Ottoman Empire since the early sixteenth century: a rule which was to end only after the First World War, when the Ottomans picked the losing horse. Britain, getting control of all of the Middle East with the help of Arabs by promising them a Pan-Arabic state, did their usual job betrayal after the war was won. Palestine came under the British mandate in 1922.Jews, who had been displaced from their homeland in prehistoric times, had been meanwhile returning since the late nineteenth century. Even though mistrust existed between them and the Arabs in the region, both religions managed to exist side-by-side in relative harmony. Of course, there were uprisings against the British, and also in-fighting between various Arab groups (some things don't change in the Middle East, it seems). However, as the years went by, Jewish immigration to the area became alarming, and the immigrants became more and more aggressive. In the period of 1936 to 1939, there was general uprising against Britain, which was suppressed: however, Britain was forced to go back from its intent to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine.After the Second World War, the immigration of European Jews to Palestine increased tremendously in numbers, and the Zionist lobby grew in power all over the Western world. Britain tried to restrict these numbers, but by then the Zionist lobby was physically and financially strong. Right-wing Zionist groups like the Irgun openly warring against the occupiers. So the British Empire went back to its time-tested formula: leave a colony which had become a losing proposition. Accordingly, the English withdrew, and the immigrants settled down clinically to the task of driving the Palestinians out. The Arabs were too disunited and lacked the will- and muscle-power to fight them. Ultimately, on 29th November 1947, the UN General Council passed a resolution legitimising the formation of independent Arab and Jewish states. And on 15th of May the following year, the state of Israel came into being.The BookThe book is divided into three parts: Palestine, England and In Search of Fatima. In the first part, the author describes her early childhood in a relatively peaceful country ending with the ultimate violent uprooting; in the second, her coming of age in England and the realisation that she is an unfortunate hybrid, English in upbringing and Arab in spirit, belonging neither here nor there; and in the third, her return to Palestine to find her roots, symbolised by her childhood nurse, Fatima.Ghada Karmi was born (possibly -because in those days, Arabs did not keep any note of birthdays) on the 19th of November, 1939, into a world at war and a country passing through the final stages of a violent uprising. She says her mother never wanted to have her, because it was no world to bring a child into. However, soon after Ghada's birth, the country entered a stage of peace between the Jews, Christians and Muslims in Palestine. Her childhood memories are peaceful, almost idyllic.Ghada's mother was from Damascus and her father was from the small village of Tulkarm. They were typical upper middle class people, and Mr. Karmi was a literate man with a collection of books. Ghada's mother was relatively advanced in her views and socialised extensively. The children were more or less left to the nurse-cum-housekeeper, Fatima, a peasant woman whom little Ghada idolised. They lived in the prosperous neighbourhood of Qatamon in Jerusalem. One could say that little Ghada had a fortunate life in turbulent times.However, all that was to change as the Zionist lobby gained strength, and the fights between Jews and Muslims escalated. But the author's family, it seems, lived in the fools' paradise that most of us live in (\"This cannot happen in MY country!\") and did not see the writing on the wall until it was too late, even when their neighbourhood was rocked by extreme violence. Even if they had foreseen their eviction from their homeland, it is doubtful whether they could have done anything, because the hopelessly divided Arab lobby was anything but capable of standing up to Zionist power. So finally, in April 1948, they had to evacuate to Syria, to the house Ghada's maternal grandparents.Ghada's mother, unable to accept permanent exile and always maintaining until the end of her life that they would return to Palestine one day, gave the key of her house to Fatima for \"safekeeping\". They moved away in a rickety taxi to the music of exploding bombs. It is at this point, when the author realised that she had to leave her dog Rex behind, the force of loss struck her in its enormity for the first time. This is captured poignantly in the book's prologue:Another explosion. The taxi, which had seen better days, revved loudly and started to move off. But through the back window, a terrible sight which only she could see. Rex had somehow got out, was standing in the middle of the road. He was still and silent, staring after their retreating car, his tail stiff, his ears pointing forward.With utter clarity, the little girl saw in that moment that he knew what she knew, that they would never meet again.This is the first wake-up call which signifies the death of childhood for ever - the harsh reality of permanent loss.They stayed for a year in Syria, but by the time Ghada's father had realised that there was no future for him there; and he was realistic enough to accept that an immediate return to Palestine was out of the question. Post-war England beckoned. Against his wife's protests, he took a job in the Arabic service of the BBC and moved to London. He ultimately succeeded in coaxing his reluctant wife to join him, along with her children. So at nine years of age, Ghada set foot on English soil for the first time, the country which was to be her adoptive motherland.Little Ghada was not at all unhappy to leave the house of her grandparents in Damascus, which was crowded with members of the joint family. The situation was further exacerbated due to the influx of more and more refugee members. Also, the country and the household was fairly traditional, more so than the relatively cosmopolitan Jerusalem. Girls were supposed to be subordinate, women had to cover their hair and one had to pray five times a day. So it must have been something of a relief to relocate to city like London.However, Mrs. Karmi refused to accept it as home. In their small apartment in Golders Green, she \"created a little Palestine\" (in Ghada's words). Their house became a centre for all displaced Arabic people. Ghada's mother staunchly refused to learn English and to go out and socialise with the locals. She built a cocoon around herself and became totally insular. The author says this embittered her and from her expression in the photographs in the book, one would tend to agree with her.Ghada's elder sister, Siham, was marked out to be a doctor: however, due to the subtle racial prejudice prevalent in British society, she could not get admission and ultimately chose chemistry as her vocation. Her brother Ziyad chose engineering, so Ghada was instructed to become a doctor by her father, even though her talent was more in literature and the humanities. But in an Arab family, you did not argue with the father \u2013 so a doctor she had to be.Ghada talks of her school years in England as pleasant enough: racism, even though present, was basically an undercurrent. In fact, among the Arab Muslim and the Jew, the inherent racist bias was more against the latter. However, Egyptian president Nasser\u2019s nationalisation of the Suez Canal on July 26, 1956 changed all that. Overnight, Arabs became barbarian aggressors in the minds of the British.In school, Ghada began to be isolated more and more. One incident of outright bullying by a Jewish classmate, Zoe Steiner, almost ended in an incident of physical violence. Incidentally, it succeeded in sowing the seed of a crucial existential question in the author\u2019s mind: was she Arab or English?This dilemma persisted throughout her teens and twenties. On the one side, she was enjoying the freedom of a liberated woman, unthinkable in the Middle East: on the other, Arab nationalism and pride were being ground into dust by Israel and her Western allies. Ghada says that at this time, the existence of a country such as Palestine was unknown in England, and she had to lie about her nationality when questioned to avoid confusion.At this time, a Pan-Arab movement was taking shape under the charismatic leadership of Nasser, watched warily by Israel. But Ghada had no time for politics because of two important events in her life \u2013 she graduated from medical school, and married a classmate (an Englishman) against her family\u2019s wishes.The marriage was doomed from the start. Ghada\u2019s family (especially her mother) was unvaryingly hostile to John, her husband \u2013 all placatory efforts from his side proved futile. And Ghada\u2019s slowly emerging nationalism as an Arab distanced them even more. But what brought things to a head was the six-day war of 1967 between Egypt and Israel which Israel won with ridiculous ease. This foreshadowed the shape of things to come in the area \u2013 unlimited expansion of Israeli borders with impunity. Naturally, Ghada was outraged but her husband was on the side of \u201cplucky\u201d Israel who won against enormous odds. She felt totally betrayed, and the rickety marriage collapsed a year later.Now, in the final part of the book, we see a new Ghada Karmi: a proud Palestinian who has embraced her identity. After the collapse of her marriage, she continued working as a doctor, feeling more and more isolated from fellow Britons when the Palestinian Liberation Organisation entered the scene, under the charismatic leadership of Yasser Arafat. Their tactics of hijacking, bombing and isolated acts of violence against Israelites helped to bring international attention to the plight of Palestinians \u2013 it also dubbed them forever as terrorists. And being unabashedly Palestinian, Ghada was automatically stamped with the label.After a frightening encounter with a group of Jewish doctors in 1971, Ghada decided to embrace the Palestinian Cause \u2013 and the PLO \u2013 fully. She established \u201cPalestine Action\u201d in England with a group of sympathisers and began to travel all over the Arab world, visiting Palestinian refugee camps and meeting leaders of the PLO. She also participated in protests and political action in England. Ghada describes the magical moment when she met Yasser Arafat, the legend, face-to-face. It seemed as though she had finally found herself. However, by 1978, the PLO had been recognised by the world at large, and Arafat was seen as the leader in exile of the Palestinian nation. Ghada says she saw no need of continuing her organisation, as it had become redundant. She felt, like many other Palestinians, that the birth of a legitimate Palestine was only a matter of time.But Israel had other ideas: it invaded Lebanon in 1978 and forced the PLO out of its Beirut headquarters. From then on, the organisation was always on its back foot, pressurised time and again by Israel until Arafat was forced to sign the Oslo Agreements of 1993 \u2013 in the eyes of Palestinians, a shameful capitulation. On the personal front, Ghada found it difficult to adjust to Arab society, especially women\u2019s role in it \u2013 she says that as a divorcee, she was seen as fair game by men. The most she could hope for was to be a second wife to somebody, or secret liaisons with married men. By the 1980\u2019s Ghada began to see that\u2026in effect, I had no natural social home in England or any other place. Did we all feel the same?.... When and where was their (her siblings\u2019 and hers) real home?To get to the root of the question, she had to\u2026go to the source, the origin, the very place, shunned fearfully for years, where it all began\u2026\u2026that is, Israel.The book concludes with Ghada\u2019s 14 day visit to Israel in August 1991 (something denied to most Palestinians), which she could do because of her British passport. She was helped by her Israeli friends. Ghada was shocked at what she saw in \u201cher\u201d country: in her opinion, nothing short of apartheid practised by Jews on Arabs, a minority without voice in what had once been their country. Even though Ghada ultimately located her house (now occupied by strangers), it was \u201cdead, like Fatima, like poor Rex, like us.\u201dThe book ends on a positive note, however, as Ghada lies on her hotel bed in Jerusalem. Suddenly the call to prayer comes floating in through the window. The author says:I closed my eyes in awe and relief. The story had not ended, after all \u2013 not for them, at least, the people who lived there, though they were herded into reservations of a fraction of what had been Palestine. They would remain and multiply and one day return and overtake. Their exile was material and temporary.Ghada feels however that her personal exile is \u201cundefined by space and time\u201d, from where \u201cthere would be no return.\u201d***Is this a great book? I cannot honestly answer in the affirmative. Ghada Karmi\u2019s style is rambling, and one feels the book would have benefited from the services of a good editor. The author rushes off on tangents many a time without returning to where she started from.The memoirs are so steeped in her feeling for Palestine and the outrage that they have suffered that the human touch is missing in many areas (especially where she is discussing relationships). Sometimes, one feels that she has to pigeonhole people (\u201cmy Jew friend\u201d, \u201cmy Catholic colleague\u201d) racially just to put things in perspective. Even her relationship with her husband and subsequent breakup is only superficially treated, other than as confirmation of her growing Arab identity and its incompatibility with the normal English milieu.Most importantly, the metaphor of Fatima, as a symbol for the lost Palestine, never takes hold in the mind of the reader.Still, this is a book which deserves to be read.In 1969, Golda Meir said: \u201cIt was not as though there were a Palestinian people in Palestine considering itself as a Palestinian people and we came and threw them out and took their country away from them. They did not exist.\u201d This was the fate of the Palestinians before the PLO entered the scene with their isolated acts of terrorism \u2013 total oblivion. The PLO made them crazed terrorists in the Western mind, which was better \u2013 at least they existed!Of late, with the increasing demonisation of Islam and Muslims in general in the West, the Palestinians have been added to those evil beings like the Al Queida who deserve to exterminated, to make the world safe for democracy. One almost feels that the crusades never ended.Well, my friends, Palestinians are neither mythical beings nor devils in human guise. They are a people who have been unjustly expelled from their home country to wander the earth as waifs, much like the Jews in previous centuries. They are human beings like you and me, who laugh, cry, eat, drink, love, hate, live and die. They do not get the justice they deserve: let them at least have a voice.Ghada Karmi provides that voice. Listen to it. Even if it evokes a single tear from you for the suffering of fellow human beings, she would not have spoken in vain."}, {"userName": "Petra X", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x", "userReview": "\"\"Hitler should have finished the job,\" quote from the author in the book.This is an anti-Semitic diatribe where the words \"Jews\" and \"Israelis\" are used interchangeably and hatred directed at both equally.Further discussion of this book is pointless since quite obviously there is going to be no balance of any kind.One thing I always wonder is this. When the land was partitioned by the British who had a Mandate to rule it (before that it was Turkish, and we are going back centuries), 70% of it was given to Transjordania, which was renamed Jordan. How come the Palestinians don't go on at Jordan to give back the land? It wouldn't be that the Jordanians are Muslim so that's all right then?Just for the record, I am in favour of a joint state. All the children should grow up together and their children and maybe the great grandchildren would be able to live side by side enjoying each other's culture."}, {"userName": "Walaa Alshehri",

"Ghada tells us her story from her childhood in Palestine, to her adolescences life in UK and then her university life. She takes us through her experience of losing a home, fighting to \u201cfit-in\u201d and then trying to find her rooots back. The story is amazing and it forces you to flip the page to know what would happen next. Definitely a must-read book if you want to know the story of Palestinian in this Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Being an Arab, we grow up feeling for Palestinians. We are taught by them, friends with them and now working with them. We can\u2019t forget that its an Arab land that was taken away. However, I would be honest with you, in the last couple of years my passion towards the Palestinian conflict was not as strong as it was when I was young. Mainly, due to the moves Palestinians make in their lands. The Fatah- Hamas fighting is just silly in my opinion and it just takes the focus out of the real conflict. This book, brought this passion back. It just heart breaking to hear the story all over again from a first hand witness and with such details. I cant imagine someone stealing a ring from me, what about my home, land and everything I own!!Another thing that puzzled me and made me really ache, was that the one day enemies became the next day friends, and how can a story of people dislocated and killed be forgotten this fast!I hope its translated into Arabic, and I hope every Arab reads it, because it just reminds us of a land we lost, and we are loosing daily. I also hope that Palestinians themselves will get their act together and find a way to get their land back, peacefully I hope."}, {"userName": "Susan Abulhawa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24108689-susan-abulhawa", "userReview": "A very poignant memoir from a woman who lived through the Naqba and remembers Palestine before she was stolen."}, {"userName": "Foxglove", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3326094-foxglove", "userReview": "A racist, bigoted author who is filled with utter hatred for Jews.

Ghada Karmi\u2019s story begins in Jerusalem where her Palestinian family is driven from their home in 1948. Karmi and her family end up living in exile in London, where the family longs for home and each family member copes in a different way.Karmi writes about her lifelong quest for cultural identity, first as an Arab schoolgirl in London trying to assimilate, later as the wife of an Englishman, and finally as a Arab-English woman who returns to the Arab World as a physician and activist. Karmi\u2019s story culminates in her return to Jerusalem in 1998, when at last she seeks to find her childhood home that she was forced to leave in 1948. By weaving together Palestinian history with her personal family story, Karmi presents a Palestinian perspective that rarely reaches the mainstream. This memoir was published in 2002, but is as relevant as ever."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/795517-wendy", "userReview": "This book deserves 4-1/2 stars. It is probably one of the best memoirs I have read. The author does a really beautiful job describing the sense of dislocation, both geographic and emotional, that she and her family experienced when they left their home in Jerusalem in 1948. Each member of her famiy dealt with this wrenching loss in their own way and because the author was the youngest, and only a small child when they left Jerusalem, I think she experienced a great deal of confusion and no one seemed to realize that explanation or reassurance would have been a good thing for her (emotionally speaking). It was interesting learning about how she tried to find the place where she belonged -- and how she had the sense that she was an outsider in both British and Arab society.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reading and learning more about the Israeli/Palestinian history."}, {"userName": "Debbie Blane", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1838314-debbie-blane", "userReview": "This is a well-written book. While from a personal perspective it is also an excellent historical overview from the Palestinian point of view of the creation of the State of Israel. The author begins her story before the \"nakba\", terrible happening, when British forces in Palestine deserted the Palestinian people to the onslaught brought by the Jews. It ends just before the year 2000. For me, living currently on the African continent in an Arabic culture, it was helpful to reinforce some of things I have already known about Arab culture. For instance: In marriage personal feelings are not considered as important as the collective wisdom of the family. There are situations where a man taking a second wife can seem more merciful than divorcing the first one. Israel was created by the guilt of Europe (and America) over what blind eyes allowed to happen to the Jews. Unfortunately, two wrongs do not make a right. Good history from an unusual perspective.

Karmi, a physician turned activist, helped start one of the first pro-Palestinian groups in the UK in the early 70s. Her evocation\u2014presumably based on interviews since she was so young\u2014of the last days of Palestine before partition are excellent. Her description of her family\u2019s difficult transition to England is the real strength of the memoir. Her best friends were Jewish, until the Suez Crisis when Karmi is saddled with support for Nasser. Her first marriage\u2014much resisted by her family\u2014to an Englishman who converts, collapses in the wake of the Six Day War. Her memoir is frustratingly blurry and hurried on what would have been an interesting account of the movement at a time when the PLO was known for audacious acts of skyjacking and civilian murder. She notes these as inexcusable, describes Munich as \u201cshocking\u201d but without criticism of the PLO\u2019s blunders, tactical or moral. Ambivalent about Arab culture and unattracted to Arab men, she is equally frustrated with the Jews she encounters; some of her language betrays a borderline anti-Semitism. She calls the orthodox praying at the Western Wall an \u201calien horde\u201d, responds to an anti-Arab Jewish bully with physical violence and \u201cHitler should have finished the job\u201d\u2014her family is proud of her assault\u2014reproduces her family\u2019s descriptions of the Jews as \u201ccowardly\u201d and \u201ccursed\u201d while insisting on the absence of anti-Semitism, and overall gives the Zionist project not. the. slimmest. shred of sympathy or understanding. The Fatima of the title is the faceless, fateless, peasant housekeeper of her childhood; indeed, it is an apt title since she romanticizes a Palestine that never quite was for her middle-class family, one of ennobled peasants, stoic traditionalists wedded to the land, a coherent cultural Arab Shire destroyed with malice in black and white by Orc-like Zionists (she actually describes seeing the Knesset building as \u201cheadquarters of Sauron\u201d). She indignantly questions why Jews sing Hatikvah at weddings, why the British are wary of Nasser, and why Israel is applauded after the Six Day War, as if they were all mad, or at least inconsiderate of the needs of her Arab identity. I winced at her essentializing Arabness and her frequent racialized descriptions, noting how this or that Jews had \u201cAryan\u201d features, or that an Israeli-identified man whose mother was not Jewish was not a \u201cpure bred\u201d Jew. If this is the most high-profile Palestinian diaspora memoir\u2014besides, perhaps, Edward Said\u2014I fear it offers a problematic and bitter portrait of Palestinian diaspora identity, one whose problems I fear will be lost on uncritical pro-Palestinian supporters and whose value will be lost on mildly pro-Israel Jewish readers."}, {"userName": "Bayan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6268682-bayan", "userReview": "I will not be doing the book justice because I have lots of ideas and emotions inside with little ability to translate them to words. The book wasn't a smooth read for me and I didn't want to finish with it. This happens whenever I read a book about the Palestinian cause- including my people's misplacement, exodus,sufferings, and uncertainties. Maybe because I know there will be no happy ending (so far) and that the book will end with the author's hopes of change and justice. In Search of Fatima is a memoir by Ghada Karmi, a dislocated Palestinian living most of her life in Britain. Her search for identity and belonging is daunting- causing her to psychologically suffer. She's suspended between two different cultures, belonging to neither. Her case is not individual since millions of Palestinians are scattered all over the world. The experience of exile has always had its advantages and disadvantages. One of the latter is knowing Palestine by memory only- mostly not their own but that of their parents and grandparents telling stories about their lost country. I think Fatima is a symbol the author has used to refer to the loss of Palestine. Ghada's return and quest for finding Fatima can mean Palestinians' return to their homeland. Ghada seems optimistic about this and about many Palestinians' affiliations to their cause and home but much less when it comes to the enigma of her own identity. Britain's stance towards the Palestinian dilemma is highly problematic- what with Balfour's promise, support of Jewish immigration to Palestine, with military and weaponry aid. Palestinians can never forgive Britain for this- planting \"the root of the Jewish state\" it's called. Britain to Ghada, beside what's mentioned, is a shelter, a place of good education and a civilized culture. Torn between these two facets of the same country, Ghada never feels settled. Her conflicting feelings and thoughts provide the readers with a glimpse of what it means to be a Palestinian in a human light that is rarely shown."}, {"userName": "Sarah Lameche", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21310197-sarah-lameche", "userReview": "It is 2.20am.

These past few years I really didn't know what was keeping me here. Yet after reading this book I finally appreciate what I have. We may have no jobs, rubbish weather and Chavs in every town. Yet what we do have is a place to call home. This is My country. I was born here and I have my memories. I can go wherever I please. Revisit places I have seen, houses I have lived in. I can visit my friends I have known since childhood. Visit my relatives. Speak my own language and read the road signs. No one is going to put a gun in my face or live in my house. I am free. I know who I am and where I have come from. Ghada karmi didn't have this. And perhaps she will never know who she really is.

Ghada Karmi, a small girl in 1948, tells of her family's flight from Jersualem to Damascus and then to England, where her father worked for the BBC. Her parents never intended to settle in England permanently, but always planned to return to Palestine. Ghada, however, tried hard to become a \"typical English girl\" - quite a struggle in a society which, as she gradually realized, was unconsciously racist and entirely ignorant of her native culture. Surprisingly, this book is often quite funny, as well as moving and thought-provoking - Ghada's first experience of an English tea, for example, is unforgettable. I also found the ending (spoilers), in which Ghada returns to Jerusalem in order to try to track down her old nanny, Fatima, and her family home, absolutely riveting. You don't have to love history or politics to love this book. All you need is an open mind and an interest in people, cultures, families and how they interact.

Due to my own ignorance, I thought that the setting for this book would have been the Gaza Strip. I am very thankful to Ghada Karmi for expanding my socio-political understanding of this complex issue. I recently attended a presentation by monitors from the organization Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel. Their website is at http://eappi.org/ .They gave the attendees a close look at the near Third World living conditions of many Palestinians. They addressed the issue of what it is like to stand in line for checkpoints. Most of those who have to leave their Palestinian areas for work in Israel have to pass through checkpoints where they have to arrive three hours early in order to ensure their getting to work on time.

It is told in a very simple, straightforward manner -- Karmi is no magician with words -- but I did find it interesting. As an Arab who is always wondering how we got ourselves in the mess that we are today, I found her descriptions of Palestinian society just before 1948 to be a real eye-opener ... they seemed to pretty passive in front of the increasingly daring Zionist attacks on their city, looking to the British occupiers to save the day. I'm not sure if she intended to paint such a picture, but it was clear lesson nonetheless that those who don't take hold of their own destinies can expect their destinies to be determined by others.I enjoyed reading about Karmi's girlhood and young womanhood in part to compare it with my own growing up in the West. She moved to London at a time when few Arabs or Muslims lived there, and so had a greater struggle holding on to her identity. She also gave me a peek into how much of their heritage more secular Arabs hold on to when they adopt the West as their home. While there were a lot of differences between her experience and mine, I was surprised to see similarities as well. For example, she describes being angry at her father's attitude that she would be just another Arab girl by default, as if her childhood years in England were just a garment she could shrug off. Boy, did that remind me of my own frustrations as a young woman! Of course, there is one key difference, a very sad one, that I was able as an adult to go back and live in the land of my parents, whereas she was not and probably never will -- though perhaps there is hope for her young nieces and nephews."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6412104-christine", "userReview": "This book was almost like a reprieve after reading the rather taxing fluid-time books Seasons and Secret Life. Being an autobiography, the time had to be far more linear and stricter making it an easier reading journey. A moving and resonate autobiography, definitely one of the best I've ever read. Since it was an autobiography, it could afford to spend time providing background and history therefore filling me in on the little details I (as well as other Western readers, or even Arab youth) might have missed when reading the very condensed novels where whole issues may be tackled in a single chapter or sentence. So, in my personal opinion, out of all the forms of Palestinian media I've been exposed to, the novella, the novel, the documentary, the film, the autobiography, this proves the most moving and powerful to me.
