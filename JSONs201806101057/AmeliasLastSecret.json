It is based on some information that came to like when historical files where made public. It covers three different time eras. I really enjoyed reading this, although it made me sad to realize that to this day we don't have any idea what might have really happened to her."}, {"userName": "Evangheline Farcas", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5618917-evangheline-farcas", "userReview": "This is one book I read in a day and that says a lot for me. I couldn't put it down. We are thrown right into the story that begins with Amelia at the begining of her last flight. The speculation in this book is believable and makes you wonder what if? Also it makes you want to dig deeper into history (which a good historical fiction will do). I found it fast paced, with the action begining immediately and holding you captive to the last word. It begins with the past and moves forward a few years with Lance Corporal Oliver who fins an artifact left over from the crash. Conspiracy and a cover up is woven masterfuly throughout the book. Then it moves further into the present where it leaves open the possibility of the truth being descovered to what actually happened to Amelia. We are introduced to a character named Jane Graveley who I instantly loved. There is a fight scene that I abolutely loved and had me laughing and gasping for breath. The ending was both heartbreaking and satisfying, I knew it had to come, I knew history demanded it, but still I found myself hoping that Eric could change history. That's what this book does, even though you know the ultimate end it still makes you go on. Also I noted throughout the book how much research this must have taken and what a great job he did at weaving facts into the story--for example details about the plane itself, codes, buttons and even minor things. This wasn't a book that was just thrown together carelessly, it was a book that I could tell was woven together masterfully. Even though it was shorter (hence it being a novella)I think this might fast become one of my favorite Eric Wilson book. In the end I strongly recommend it!"}, {"userName": "Sean Savacool", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9850342-sean-savacool", "userReview": "When I first saw that Eric was going to be writing a novella, much less a speculative history novella, I got a little excited... and a little suspicious. Eric is known for writing thrillers with strong historical ties and complex characters that develop over a series of novels. His Jerusalem's Undead trilogy had its own rich mythology and ties to the historic that reached back to even his first novel. When I think Eric Wilson, I tend to think \"big sprawling epic thousands of years in the making.\" So, Eric writing a novella? I didn't know if he could pull it off. But I was surprised. I could not put the story down.It is a story in four parts. The illustration at the beginning lets you know that we are going to begin and end with Amelia, but first we will have to travel all the way up to the present day be fore we do so. The story speculates on what might have happened to Amelia Earhart in 1937 on her last plane flight, and ultimately her death. Along the way we meet a Navajo code talker during WWII and later a teenage girl who just wants to do some good in the world. There are big government conspiracies, secret societies, gun shots, big dreams, and shattering disappointments. A lot to pack into an eighty page novella! But the writing is good, the characters believable, and the plot tight and fast paced. I'm looking forward to seeing what else Eric might tinker with next in the short fiction medium. He's one of the best writers we've got, so I hope he keeps writing more and more in the years to come."}, {"userName": "Reuben H.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6515648-reuben-h", "userReview": "Amelia's Last Secret is a novella by bestselling author Eric Wilson about the fate of Amelia Earhart\u2014one of the most prominent and well-respected women in the history of the world. It is available on Amazon for $2.99 exclusively as an ebook.Everyone knows Amelia Earhart, and everyone has at least speculated about her mysterious disappearance in history. Leave it to somebody like Eric Wilson to take the facts as we know them and write a brilliant story from it. He took real people, events, and information, and put them all together in an intriguing and believable manner full of mystery and suspense.The novella is split into four parts, taking place over the past seventy-five years:Part One - July 1, 1937Part Two - June 8, 1944Part Three - May 17, 2012Part Four - July 2, 1937The first part begins from the point of view of Amelia Earhart, and ends with a cliffhanger, which is concluded in the final part. The two middle parts continue the story of how Ms. Earhart's fate was discovered. All four parts were extremely well-written and make you want to continue reading. The amount of research put into the story is astounding and truly adds life to the tale.Eric Wilson is an amazing writer, and Amelia's Last Secret helps to prove it. The ending is a little sad\u2014but you can't deny that the inevitable would happen. The novella could make a great movie, or at least a short film. Kudos to Mr. Wilson for writing such a masterpiece. It is well worth your reading time."}, {"userName": "C.J.

Was it simple plane trouble or was sabotage involved? Was she trying to escape or run away from someone or something? Was Amelia caught up in something like espionage on behalf of the United States to report on the activities of the Japanese at the time when World War II was being fought?There have been endless questions and scenarios that have been presented to explain the disappearance of Amelia Earhart. However, no one knows what truly happened on that last flight. Perhaps one day, the truth will finally be revealed. Although, honestly, I think it is much more fun to have an unsolved mystery where one can think of a myriad of events and explanations as to what really happened to this adventurous, social trend-setting, mystery of a woman.Eric Wilson attempts his own explanation of Amelia\u2019s disappearance in this novella. He brings along his meticulous detail to research, as well as his boundless imagination, to bear in this fun adventure of his. While this story may feel a little choppy at times as it jumps and skips along, it lays out Eric\u2019s best, most inventive guess as to the fate of Amelia.To me, I felt the way the story flowed helped to succinctly navigate you through the most critical times with the most efficiency in relation to the length of the story itself. You may feel like you are being rushed along, but afterwards, as you reflect, you begin to realize just how much you actually experienced in that short amount of time. It\u2019s quite a head rush actually, and left me wanting not only to know more of what Eric thinks happened, but also of what is known to have actually happened and then to make up my own story from there.I would recommend this book to anyone with any level of curiosity concerning unsolved mysteries. Unsolved mysteries have always proved to be a huge interest to me. I am the type of person who wants to know more. I continue to ask questions after the presenter has finished talking. I bug those around me with one what-if scenario after another which is why I truly enjoyed this story. I was very pleased to see Eric continue to stretch and expand his fictional repertoire with a story such as this one plucked straight from history itself. His creativity and writing ability made this story the provocative and exhilarating breath of fresh air that it is."}, {"userName": "James Bruno", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5114011-james-bruno", "userReview": "If you want a fun and fast read on your Kindle, get this swift-paced historical novella by NYT bestselling author Eric Wilson. The author takes on an unsolved mystery that has stumped countless investigators and researchers for three-quarters of a century: just what happened to aviatrix Amelia Earhart? But more intriguing than that question is: what might have happened to Earhart? This is where Wilson thrives -- taking an historical event and building a suspense-filled plot around it. Meticulously researched, \"Amelia's Last Secret\" begins with the hero-pilot's embarkation on a high-risk flight with her co-pilot in 1937. The author deftly takes us from that year to 1944 to the present and back again -- no mean feat to pack into an 80-page book. But the plot moves and the characters are believable. In particular, Oliver Dale, one of the famous WWII Navajo Code Talkers, is worthy for a reprise in a future book. Wilson throws in espionage, romance and edgy suspense to make for a story that has the reader scratching his head and wondering, \"This might've really happened. . .\"There are several untied loose ends in the story that deserved closer attention by the author. But all in all, this is a fun read."}, {"userName": "Michael John Sullivan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1942928-michael-john-sullivan", "userReview": "Eric Wilson is one of the most underrated storytellers of our time. So, it wasn't surprising to me to see the many wonderful reviews about a woman the world adored. Having read up on Amelia Earhart a few times in my lifetime, I was especially intrigued to read what Wilson had to say.I wasn't disappointed.The author does a tremendous job with the details and giving the reader a wonderful feel to what it was like back during Earhart's lifetime. While it was 75 years ago, the questions surrounding her disappearance have never waned.The NY Times best-selling author recaptures the temperature of the times and makes this story not only an intriguing read but an exciting one.The wonderful part of this story is I've also learned more about the times, how people reacted to each other, the thought process during war time.It's truly a puzzle in what happened to Earhart and Eric does a great job in trying to put all the pieces together.World War II is considered the war that needed to be fought.
