Not to put too fine a point on it, but at one point or another, each of the many characters in this book has their moment of crisis: some simple, others not so, but the varying strengths and quirks in this group show the power of speaking a thought into the universe. See, the women of Southlea Bay are, at least in this group, a bunch of rejected writers: writers who demand and celebrate each rejection with panache and style, taking no notice of the fact that (at least from what I saw here) there isn\u2019t a truly original or workable idea to be found. Oh that\u2019s not to say that they are terrible, but particularly with the building of the \u2018script\u201d for the benefit to help save one of their member\u2019s farm and house, the near full on rip off of The Wizard of Oz, and the justifications that make it different are as cringe-worthy as they are utterly ridiculous and funny. Not knowing what to expect from my first encounter, there was plenty of information and references explaining the first in the series, and the character of Janet \u2013 the outwardly most \u2018normal\u2019 of the bunch, with her inability to say \u201cno\u201d and a husband who just laughs at her frustrations and concerns\u2026. Herding Cats comes to mind, clearly and completely appropriate. With everything you shouldn\u2019t do to create a play, a retiring and rather \u2018out of her time\u2019 lead actress meant to sing her way through the moments, a stalwart and never take no ringleader and plenty of soft moments where the concern for Annie and her farm strike every character, it was hard to put down and harder to not wonder what will happen next. These ladies of the Rejected Writers club are funny, caring, accepting and above all wholly committed to their group, their friendships and their town.

I certainly laughed much less than with the first book but I really didn't like Stacy the self-centered daughter at all all in the first book; imagine my surprise when the author brings her back with a \"decisive\" place around her parents and her mother's friends, all the while being even more selfish - I didn't think it could be possible - and childish. Pregnancy doesn't excuse such attitude.Marcy too takes up the stage - no pun intended - with Dan, and she too is the most manipulative person, apart from Stacy perhaps, in the world and everyone falls for her act, Dan included.I felt I was more than enough irritated through the story between those two and I was not entertained enough in between, so every time I sat down to read I didn't expect to LOL like with the first story.I loved the ending, didn't expect it, and was glad it had a \"feel good\" aura about it."}, {"userName": "Selena", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17055276-selena", "userReview": "Just as funny as Rejected Writers Book Club!

If you haven't read the first book it doesn't matter, this works just as well as a stand alone. Kelman is very good at filling the reader in with any information that they need in a non evasive manner with a succinct recap to allow you to pick up the story and tell you know all you need about the key characters to enjoy this second foray into the usual chaos, hilarity and heartwarming adventures of the eclectic gang.Our protagonist, Janet, is our narrator for some of the chapters. She is an engaging and witty observer of events as she tries to \"navigate her way through all shades of crazy that is small town life.\" She joined the Rejected Writers' Club a few years ago and took them on a road trip across America as they attempted to get one of their manuscripts rejected. Yes, you read that right - they wanted to get a contract to publish one of their novels rejected! As their name suggests, the Rejected Writers' Club is a group of women who have been writing terrible novels and keeping a collection of their rejection letters which they then share with each other on a monthly basis.This book opens with Doris Newberry on the warpath ready to construct a ludicrous plan to help raise some money for Annie whose farm has been threatened by the bank unless she can raise a huge amount of money.\"The words 'Doris Newberry' worked faster than 'abracadabra' to create disappearing tricks all over Southlea Bay.\"Doris is a vibrant soul, but actually all the characters in this story are distinctive and vividly portrayed, literary and metaphorically full of colour and very easy to visualise.\"[Ruby] had opted for an ensemble she was calling \"prism joy\", if people asked, with inspiration from the rainbow colours that bounced around her shop from the crystals hanging in her windows.\" Ruby is also on a 'detox' which does not go down well when the group meet for an emergency meeting in the cafe and she asks for hot water with a squeeze of lemon.\"I can bring you a lemon, but you will have to squeeze it yourself. Squeezing lemons for people who don't have the strength because they are not eating is not in my job description.\" Doris suggests that the Rejected Writers' Club put on a musical in order to raise the money needed to save Annie's farm. Before she knows what has happened, just like in book 1, Janet has found herself volunteering to make the far fetched suggestion become a reality.\"Had I agreed to direct a stage show? The words got stuck in my brain, like soap in a colander. I didn't know the first thing about directing a show.\" Neither does anyone else in the group. Neither can any of them sing, dance, act or direct. But that is not going to deter them. Especially when Doris decides to hold auditions with a very clear list of what they are - or are not - looking for in their prospective cast and crew. Her poster details this so anyone bold enough to step up to the challenge is clear about what is required of them:\"No late arrivals, no loiterers, no time wasters, no kids, no food or drink, no bad singers, no bad dancers, no bad actors. Come on down it will be fun.\"But against all odds, the one thing the Rejected Writers' Club can ensure is fun. And they will always rise to a challenge. Against all odds!The Rejected Writers Take to the Stage isn't just about a chaotic, eclectic group of women, it also has a sub plot of a love triangle between three characters and also explores issues of friendship, love and small communities.This is a great, lighthearted novel about a charismatic group of women. It has echoes of things like \"The Calendar Girls\" and \"Big Stone Gap\". As with Book One, it would make a fantastic TV series or film. Kelman's writing is fast paced, entertaining, lively and enjoyable. If you are looking for a bit of escapism, a place to lose yourself for a while, a story about friendship and pulling together then this is the book for you."}, {"userName": "Anita Kovacevic", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38410617-anita-kovacevic", "userReview": "When a book starts off with this chapter title - FROZEN YETIS & SCOTCH TAPE SHENANIGANS, you know you are in for a fun(ny) ride. If you have had the chance to read the first book in the Southlea Bay Series, The Rejected Writers' Book Club, and liked it as I did, then you are looking forward to each of these chapter titles, each of the darling characters and their quirky mishaps and strong friendship. If you enjoyed Suzanne Kelman' witty writing, you will have high expectations. And the author sure delivers. Yet again. Her charming tale of a group of average (ha-ha) small-town ladies, an unlikely bunch but a band of bonded pals nonetheless, joins to save a member of their Rejected Writers' Book Club from financial ruin and losing her family farm estate (turned into a dog shelter). Do they simply pitch in with money? No. They are average people with average incomes. Do they go begging online? No. They are average (some even elderly) ladies on a remote island with an age-appropriate reluctance for social media. They set up a charity musical. Can they dance, sing or direct? No, but why should that stop them, especially with their town matron Doris pushing and pulling them all? Enough spoilers from me - let me just say the story will have it all - from feathery boas and a run-down theatre to a love triangle, catastrophe and (re)birth. And fear not, the author skillfully introduces a few segments which can help you follow even if you have missed the pleasure of reading the first part.What I love most about the series are the characters - a cast of everyday people we all know and love, or love to hate, and I am happy to find some new ones in this book, a very welcome addition to the Southlea Bay family. I admit I would have slapped Marcy, the vixen, on several occasions, and yet she did make a certain process possible eventually. (Come to think of it, I could have even knocked some senses into Dan a few times, but yes, we all know such naive men, too.) Doris is the sort of lady we all get annoyed by, but when trouble comes knocking, you always want them on your side, Lottie and Lavinia are unique in their duality, Janet is the not-always-loud voice of reason, Martin is phenomenal and so on. Gladys is my absolute favourite although she'd (only) be getting supporting role award if it came to filming this. (What's the hold-up, by the way?)There is friendship and kindness in this book which is so rarely found these days; and that good feeling is what you are left with after you read it. The laughs, the giggles and chuckles, too. It reminded me in spirit to The Darling Buds of May, one of my favourite TV comedy series. So there - if you want to feel like that, read it. You may just hug your family more, call your friends again. Or simply tickle someone, just for laughs. Well done, Suzanne Kelman! Comedy with heart is not easy to do. We should all laugh more often.

I laughed so hard at times while reading that tears literally flowed. Kelman has created characters and dialogue and situations that are truly hilarious. But the book is not all laughs. There are some serious times too. In fact, the concern for the women in the Rejected Writers Book Club this time is saving the family farm of one of their members. Behind in her mortgage, the bank is hoovering over Annie, threatening possession. Doris' answer is to put on a benefit, a musical production. And that is when the fun begins.There is also a little romance in the book. The growing relationship between Dan and Flora hits a roadblock when that conniving Marcy latches on to Dan. How can one man be so clueless about the wiles of a woman on the prowl?All of those elements combine to form a well crafted humorous novel. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about how the women in the club came together to help Annie. It's a heart warming story with quirky characters, a tender romance, and scenes that will make you laugh your socks off. A plus for me is that it takes place on the island of which I am a native and still reside. I can hardly wait for the next in the series.This is the second novel in this series but reads very well on its own.I received a complimentary egalley of this book through the author.

I'm pleased to say, I enjoyed it just as much. Although it's a sequel, you don't need to have read the first book as the story is completely standalone. If you have read the first book though, you will enjoy meeting the characters again.In this book, the ladies of The Rejected Writers Book Club are still happily receiving rejection letters for their work but this time have a new writing challenge to face. One of their number, Annie, is facing losing her home, and sanctuary for her rescue dogs, as she has fallen behind with mortgage payments. Her friends are determined they won't allow this to happen and come up with the idea of writing and performing a play to help raise the money she needs. Meanwhile Flora, is delighted to find that her friend Dan is coming to visit but who is the clingy woman he brings with him?Once again I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with the eccentric ladies of Southlea Bay. I love the obvious friendship between them, despite their differences, and they way they rallied round to try to help Annie in her hour of need. The stage show Doris writes bears more than a passing resemblance to The Wizard of Oz and there were so many moments which made me laugh out loud. As soon as there was a mention of characters appearing in a cloud of smoke or being catapulted onto the stage, I knew it was going to be a hoot!Aside from the stage show, Flora's blossoming romance with Dan is a major strand of the story. She can't understand who this Marcy is who Dan has brought to Southlea Bay and although it's obvious to the reader what is going on, poor Flora is very despondent. There are so many missed opportunities and misunderstandings between the two and I was willing them just to talk to each other properly. If only Marcy didn't keep getting in the way!A thoroughly enjoyable read about the value of friendship and sticking together with lots of warm humour - I can't wait to see what the ladies get up to next!"}, {"userName": "Danielle Urban", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29092975-danielle-urban", "userReview": "Rejected Writers Take Stage by Suzanne Kelman is a wonderful woman's fiction piece.

Annie lives in her old family home where she houses rescue dogs on the property. The rejected writers decide to write and produce a theatrical production in order to help Annie raise the funds needed to avoid foreclosure.The fun begins from the time this group starts planning the production: Who will write and direct?

There is a touch of romance, a demanding pregnant daughter, and the uncertainty that they can pull off this venture. This is not the place to find in-depth character studies or a discussion of serious theatre. It does deal with diverse relationships and how these women deal with them. I became comfortable with these ladies. It is hard to not smile or even laugh out loud when reading about the effort the ladies make to put on their production.

The Rejected Writers' Book Club (Southlea Bay)Rejected Writers Take the Stage (Southlea Bay #2) 1 had the audio with it but by the time this one came out it wasn't showing that as it was before, but no huge deal. What was more of an issue, same as last one, is that the story is funny in a humorous way, at least at first, though more than a bit slow on the start up and afterwards, but even with the background in the first one too much was recovered in the 2nd one. There was still too many unnecessary side bits. The writer's blurb made it sound like a cozy or a longer mystery, and it really wasn't that, for either one. However, having said that, it about half the book or more just to get to a certain point, with both books, and again as with the last one just way too much 'extra' and side stuff that does nothing to advance the story or anyting pertinent, and again same as last book there were things in there that made no sense and/or were contradicted in other parts. Just a couple of examples is the one lady taking off her costume paws, which she'd had on while cooking or whatever else, wiping her hand then, then putting the paws back on, so uh huh? And the one lady is in bed and when she gets up to go make a call on her cell, which is downstairs, she put ON her 'nightgown' uh she was clothed already from the way the story talked, so assume the writer doesn't know the word housecoat or bathrobe or some such thing.The highschool b.s. of does he/doesn't he/will he/won't he is crap and it's more stupid than even silly.
