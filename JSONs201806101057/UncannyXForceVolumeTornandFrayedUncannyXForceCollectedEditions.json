Usually a comic book is marked by each writer's take on the story and characters within specific arcs that are then referenced by other writers down the line. With Marvel's reboot we see Uncanny X-force return to the shelves this time headed by Sam Humphries and I was shocked when I saw that Psylocke was on the front cover.If you've read Remender's stellar run on this series or the reviews I've written you'll know that the series came to a definitive end where all story lines were wrapped up neatly (except for that whole 3 Fantomex business). This includes the characters such as Psylocke who goes through a lot of emotional trauma and the idea that she would jump into the skin tight black suit is simply silly.Humphries adds other boring characters to the mix until we get what is effectively a joke X-force team. Puck? Really? The writing also makes me roll my eyes inputting a black dash symbolizing a swear does not make the writing gritty it just makes the reader annoyed. I couldn't even tell you the plot since it was simply bad. Obviously Marvel wanted to get a money grab through nostalgia but readers aren't that desperate. If you want good X-force stories just re-read the old ones."}, {"userName": "Craig", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/649244-craig", "userReview": "This is just bad.

It started with a three-issue arc where Psylocke heads to Madripoor to settle some unfinished business with the Fantomexes. (Fantomex is her former lover, who has now been split into three separate cloned bodies, each with different elements of its personality, leaving her unsure who she really loves. It's confusing, but hey, X-men.)This arc starts with a little humor at least, with a nice self-referential note on how Psylocke's image has changed over the years, from nice, British Betsy Braddock in a pink bathrobe to a leggy, Japanese ninja in a bathing suit. But the love triangle that develops is pretty silly, and it only gets shakier as the issues proceed. It ends up offering a bit of closure that I never needed in the first place.After that we go back to the main storyline from the first volume: Bishop has returned from the future infected by some psychic demon ghost. It's now spreading through L.A., and it even overwhelms our heroes, unleashing their revenants (the evil alter egos that lurk in all of us) onto the world. Again, there are some nice gag lines here, notably with Puck, but a pretty dire situation is handled too easily, without much dramatic interest or sense of risk. The volume even ends on a cliffhanger, after a final issue that seems rushed and overcompressed.I like some of the dialogue here, but the plotting seems unfocused and the ultimate threat ends up being something we've seen before. I wish it had gone in a different direction, showing more confidence in exploring its own ideas.Read digital issues"}, {"userName": "Chris Lemmerman", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7530649-chris-lemmerman", "userReview": "I feel like the title of this series doesn't really suit it. This isn't an Uncanny X-Force, but it is a pseudo-team worth watching.The first story here shows us the background between Psylocke and the three Fantomexes, which is an intriguing if slightly baffling tale. I'm not sure if the characterization is exactly right, but it is an unpredictable and enjoyable little romp.We get back to business after that with the second story which brings back an old X-Foe I personally love, and continues the Revenant War story we got going in the first volume. This is a more straight-forward story than the first, and has a fun cliffhanger that makes me want to know what's next very soon.Artistically this volume is a mixed bag. Adrian Alphona's artwork is beautiful, whilst Dalibor Talajic's contributions are fairly bog-standard and unremarkable. Ramon Perez's two issues are disappointingly messy, a far cry from his lovely work on Wolverine and the X-Men.This is still not a shade on the previous UXF, but taken as a separate book, it's worth having a read."}, {"userName": "Neil McCrea", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2141174-neil-mccrea", "userReview": "I don't know why I do this to myself. I don't remember liking any X-Force title in the past. I've found Psylocke to be a dodgy character ever since her mind was placed in a ninja's body lo those many years ago. Fantomex irritates more than entertains. Bishop is written poorly more often than well. I love Storm & Spiral. One day someone will write Puck up to his potential, that day has not yet come. I love the Demon Bear from the old New Mutants story line, I can't determine whether this bear is supposed to somehow be that older bear or not. Cassandra Nova is a poorly conceived antagonist whose abilities change wildly from appearance to appearance to suit the whims of the current creator.In short, this volume contains many of the problematic aspects of superhero comics, and very few of their virtues."}, {"userName": "B", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6063018-b", "userReview": "I don't know. I thought the Fantomex, three minds, three bodies thing was interesting. I think the demon bear thing is interesting. I think Spiral is interesting. I think Puck is confusing. Probably Bishop is interesting, but I can't tell if that's just unresolved confusion from his heel turn. I'd like to see more of these people. This is the first time I'm using the \"spoiler\" tag because my most pressing comment deals with the Big Reveal in the last few pages: that the Big Bad is an evil Charles Xavier. The reason I think that's interesting is because it makes at least four X-books where the Big Bad is a different evil Charles Xavier: Uncanny Avengers, Xtreme X-men, X-Men Legacy, and Uncanny X-Force. There's something a little weird about a \"new\" creative direction in which an idea is repeated with such frequency.

Humphries\u2019 lead story is shockingly good, with its believable look at what it means for Phantomex to be split in three, going hand-in-hand with terrific characterization for Betsy and a really fun reveal of the past. This feels like it could have been written by Remender! [8/10]Revenants (10-12). The next couple of issues are unfortunately a big step down, as we get pointless and long fights with revenants (whatever they are!) and evil doppelg\u00e4ngers [5/10]. Only the last issue saves the revenants storyline, thanks to a great focus on Spiral and attractive art [7/10].Overall, this volume is quite uneven, which is unfortunately what I expect of Humphries. Still, it's decently good on average. I do find it frustrating that the story stops rather than actually ending."}, {"userName": "Joe Young", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37876-joe-young", "userReview": "Sam Humphries - writerAdrian Alphono & Dalabor Talajic - illustratorsChris Sotomayor & Lee Loughridge - color artistsFirst, see exactly what happened in Paris when Fantomex split into three separate people - all of whom are in love with Psylocke!

The first volume was decent and set up a reasonable tale, but this goes in a new direction that is terribly unsatisfying. I really hate what Humphries does with Psylocke and Fantomex. It undoes so much of the characterization from the last run, and it's just not enjoyable. The second story arc isn't much better. It's disjointed and hardly makes sense. It doesn't give any character enough time to shine. Plus it reintroduces one of my least favorite villains, and in the process undoes a whole bunch of development that they'd been working toward. On top of all that, the art is terrible. The line work is sloppy, the colors are muddy. It does absolutely nothing for me. The last issue in the book is decent, but still not good. I hate to say it, but I can see why this book has been cancelled."}, {"userName": "Zack!

One thing I will say is that this is one of the most \"soap opera\" comics I have read in a long time. Seriously think about: it's got these weird love triangles and clones and such all running around. It's such a soap opera clich\u00e9. (Or a early 90's Spider-Man clich\u00e9). If you want to read this book I would suggest you not go into it thinking about Remender's run of the previous series. It just won't measure up.
