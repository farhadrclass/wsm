It's clearly an autobiography (the details of Moritz's early life are almost identical to Reiser's) but with a name chosen to reflect his themes - Anton is St Anthony of the Desert and Reiser is of course the one who travels - so, Anton Reiser = the wandering hermit. And what a hard time he has of it - impossible not to read it without feeling a huge well of sympathy, not only for him, but for all those who feel the world has been against them, their talents are overlooked, and worldly success has eluded them...and doesn't everyone feel that sometimes?There is occasionally something a little absurd about Anton - his intensity, his extreme sensitivity to slights, his Germanic obsession with metaphysical theology, his moral earnestness...and yet I find his eccentricity delightful. When his landlady gives him a Christmas cake, he spends two whole weeks lying on his bed, thinking, sometimes reading and writing poetry, without changing his clothes, before the cake is consumed and he re-appears...but we forgive him his dirty linen, his moodiness, and his unsociability because of his love of the theatre, his gratitude for the friends he does find, and his complete lack of malice. 18th century Germany is no longer a foreign country after reading this. And when Anton takes his solitary moonlit walks, or stands on the riverbank gazing into the flowing waters, his musings will be recognised by anyone who has ever done the same. I hope I wouldn't have laughed at him (though at times I might I have been tempted). I hope I would have embraced him, and said - lighten up, you smelly, scruffy, overly serious Teuton - because you are a genius, and a loveable one too, and a world with no Anton Reiser would be a poorer place."}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1008088-jeff", "userReview": "Neglect and spite from others, bad luck, and a touch of self conscious vanity from within. Reiser can't catch a break, the recurring misfortunes are relentless, so much that it's a bit of a comedy. Very monotonous reading, 500 pgs (in my edition) of alternating potential happiness and disappointment over mundane events like school and work. The frequent recurrence of certain words and phrases that introduce negative clauses, or adjectives referring to dispair or disappointment, again, hint at a comical aspect. Since it is supposedly very close to being an autobiography, it is considered a great source for lesser known aspects of life and school at that time in Germany. It reminds me somewhat of a Finnish film called \"Tulitikkutehtaan Tytt\u00f6 (The Match Factory Girl) in its endless train of misfortune. Not nearly as depressing or tragic as that type of film at face value, but Anton Reiser is about 230 yrs old. But again, very monotonous, parts of the OT move faster than this book. Basically, the difference between 5 stars and 2-3 stars has to do with how much you can appreciate a novel from that long ago which is so completely dedicated to the ideas of unfairness and constant losing."}, {"userName": "Larissa Waibel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68360541-larissa-waibel", "userReview": "Der wahrscheinlich d\u00fcnnh\u00e4utigste Protagonist der Literaturgeschichte, mit einem Hang zum grenzenlosen Geltungsbed\u00fcrfnis - aber eine gelungene Schilderung von Karl Phillip Moritz!"}, {"userName": "Offr", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22700219-offr", "userReview": "\"Lesen Sie Anton Reiser von Moritz.

The glimpses into life in late 18th c. Germany are also really fascinating, and, in this context the woes become less purposelessly monotonous than realistically monotonous, and give real insight into how difficult it was (and is) for an intelligent, sensitive young person to develop his/her potential in spite of straitened circumstances. Apparently Moritz pulled it off, but not without great psychological strain."}, {"userName": "Nick Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11058621-nick-johnson", "userReview": "I enjoyed reading 'Anton Reiser' and like most people who read it certainly identified with Anton in certain sections of the book, especially the many humiliations he suffered at school. Throughout it all he always had that spark of intelligence that always made me feel that he had hope. Yet because of the character flaws he had picked up, due to his largely unloved childhood, he was always ready to turn a good piece of fortune into another opportunity for an obsession that would lead to near disaster. The plot was not particularly exciting but as a work of psychological self-analysis this book is well worth a read."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75633-emily", "userReview": "I LOVED this novel. I read it for a class and I don't know if its still in print but I thought it was a fantastically written account of what feudal society was like in Germany. This is a totally fascinating trip through the life of one man as he tries to change his station in life in a time when it was nigh impossible to do so. Read in a modern context its almost comedic it is so tragic and when I read it there were parts where I just had to laugh (and was sorely reprimanded by my professor who was a very stern Russian lady who did not take tragedy lightly). If copies are still around, snatch them up."}, {"userName": "Tony Gualtieri", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6970283-tony-gualtieri", "userReview": "A vivid pseudonymous autobiography of a sensitive and deeply self-aware youth growing up in Hanover in the 18th century. Although Moritz's anguish and insecurity can be tedious, it serves his goal of showing the effects of in imperfect educational system on impressionable pupils. For contemporary readers, the most striking aspect of the work is its emotional honesty. Moritz lives in these pages as few authors of his ear do."}], "description": "Well received in its own day and all but forgotten in the last century, Anton Reiser (1785) has regained in our century the popular attention it richly merits. Subtitled a \"psychological novel\" by its author, who also called it a biography, the work is actually a highly authentic autobiography. The work is singular for two reasons, the first being its perspective. Moritz was a neglected child of a loveless marriage living in a family near the bottom of the social ladder. It is small wonder that Moritz developed into the eternal outsider. With this background, his description of the struggles he endured in acquiring an education give us an unusually rich picture of that day. This autobiography is also quite singular in that it is not the usual summation by some elderly person of his road to success; rather, it is an examination by a thirty-year-old of how the various forces playing on him in his first twenty years joined to misdirect him into hopes for a theatrical career. With a gift for self-examination doubtless acquired from his Pietistic background, he is able to give a brilliant picture of how he acquired and struggled with his own neuroses, and it is this struggle that gives his book its timeless character.", "title": "Anton Reiser", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/909164.Anton_Reiser", "average": 3.79, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327321304l/909164.jpg", "reviews": 9, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/908718.Karl_Philipp_Moritz", "name": "Karl Philipp Moritz"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/43234.Ritchie_Robertson", "name": "Ritchie Robertson"}], "type": ["European Literature", "Classics", "Fiction", "Cultural", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/909164.Anton_Reiser", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2000166.Anton_Reiser_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/909165.Anton_Reiser", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5699204-anton-reiser-ein-psychologischer-roman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2377323.Anton_Reiser", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18995180-travels-in-england-in-1782", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13597835-andreas-hartknopf", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11745009-anton-reiser-ein-psychologischer-roman-dritter-theil", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2377314.El_Nuevo_Libro_Del_Abecedario_the_New_Alphabet_Book", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2000169.S_mtliche_Werke"]}
