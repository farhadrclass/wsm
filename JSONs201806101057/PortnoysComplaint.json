Philip Roth. Author of some of the defining works of the late 20th century (and even some of the early 21st). What a magnificent second act you had... and what a legacy you leave behind. ***21 Random Thoughts After Reading Philip Roth\u2019s Classic Portnoy\u2019s Complaint 46 Years After Its Controversial Publication1. I\u2019ve read three or four Philip Roth books, but how have I never read this, which catapulted him to literary fame \u2013 or at least notoriety and celebrity \u2013 in the late 60s? Everyone's read it! Even Don Draper!2. The young Roth sure was funny. We're talking laugh out loud, text-your-best-friends-favourite-lines, nearly pee your pants funny.3. The guy was also rude and crude and\u2026. hmmm\u2026. okay, maybe I shouldn\u2019t text that\u2026 um\u2026 where were we? Yes, he was rude and crude, shocking even by today\u2019s standards.Then again\u20264. It\u2019s not really Roth saying these wild things but a fictional character \u2013 namely, Alexander Portnoy, a 30-something Jewish civil liberties attorney who\u2019s got one big fat mother complex. Incidentally, Roth was born the same year (1933) and in the same city (Newark, NJ) as his protagonist. But they're not the same guy, got it? Also:5. In a brilliant structural device, the book is essentially Alex\u2019s extended monologue to his psychotherapist, with Alex trying to find out why he\u2019s so screwed up. His rant includes recounting his extreme sexual fantasies and fetishes, memories of chronic childhood masturbation habits and how he feels his persistent bachelorhood (he\u2019s in his 30s! and not married! and likes shiksas!) is tied to his ambivalent relationship with his (castrating!) mother. So, we wouldn\u2019t want to censor or harshly judge a fictional Jewish character\u2019s scabrous stream of consciousness, right? (Two words, folks: Leopold Bloom.)6. Oy gevalt! Fictional guilt-inducing Jewish mothers seem a lot like guilt-inducing Asian mothers.7. Back then, it must have been a really big deal to be in your 30s and unmarried.8. Just when you think \u201cOedipus complex,\u201d Roth/Portnoy mentions Oedipus.9. Woody Allen, who was doing stand-up at the time, must have been influenced by this book, not just in the artist-talking-to-therapist scenes but in the Jew-goes-to-WASP-girlfriend's-home-for-Thanksgiving scene in Annie Hall.10. Even with the psychoanalyst set-up, Roth cleverly gets in stuff Portnoy wouldn\u2019t necessarily tell his therapist, but which is richly detailed and adds to the novel\u2019s texture. Smart.11. The infamous liver scene makes the pastry-shtupping in American Pie (surely an homage) seem tame.12. How funny is it that the book was published in 1969? 69, get it? (groan)13. In 1969 it was way more acceptable to be misogynistic and homophobic in print. Not so funny today. (different kind of groan)14. As Katie Roiphe points out in an excellent essay from In Praise of Messy Lives: Essays, today\u2019s literary male novelists (Dave Eggers, Jonathan Franzen, Michael Chabon) sure don\u2019t write about sex the way Roth, Updike and Mailer did when they were their age.15. There's an exuberance and a vitality to this novel that\u2019s missing from a lot of the current literary fiction I read.16. The book\u2019s baseball sequences, memories, what have you\u2026 I\u2019m not even especially fond of the game, but Roth writes them with affection, tenderness and grace. And his portrait of middle-aged Jewish husband-dom is as sensitive and moving as his depiction of that era's discreet anti-Semitism is disturbing.17. Not everything works (a trip to Israel, for instance), but damn this is still a fine book.18. It was adapted into a movie starring Richard Benjamin (who also starred in his Goodbye, Columbus), and I recall seeing scenes from it late at night on TV, but it looked overdone and (checking the internet) it got really mixed reviews. So: thanks, but no thanks.19. If you do want to see a movie that captures Roth\u2019s anarchic, self-obsessed spirit, check out Alex Ross Perry\u2019s Listen Up Philip, which pays homage to the man in the central character, title and even the font used in the marketing.20. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by those American bestsellers from the late 60s to early 70s by writers dealing with the fallout of the sexual revolution. Now I\u2019m curious about John Updike\u2019s Couples and Erica Jong\u2019s Fear Of Flying.But mostly\u202621. I want to read more Philip Roth."}, {"userName": "Malbadeen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128745-malbadeen", "userReview": "It's recently been brought to my attention that my book reviews frequently are not actually about the book. And I'm wondering why would you want to know about the book when all you have to do is click on the little blurb about the book and then get on with the fascinating reading about...oh, say where I bought my milk last Tuesday or my fondest/most traumatic childhood memory, etc, etc.And, yet. I aim to please so here is my sincere attempt to tell you something about this book. It (the book) goes something like this:sexsexsexsexguiltguiltguiltguiltsexsexsexguiltguiltmoms faultguiltmoms faultmoms faultguilt sexsexguiltkinda dads fault toomostly moms faultguiltsexsexsexself loathingJewish loathingprotestant loathingprotestant awemore jewish loathingagain with the Protestant loathingsexsexguilt guiltguiltguiltpartial reconciliation with perceptions of all things Jewishattempt at sexfailure at sexguiltguiltguiltmom's faultNow that I've, no doubt drawn you into the plot line and compelled you to pick up the book for yourself, let me share with you some of my personal thoughts on the book.Growing up conservative/fundamentalist(?) Christian, I am no stranger to guilt. As a matter of fact some times I feel that Catholics and Jewish people think they have the market cornered on guilt, well, you know what? taint so. I got some pretty messed up voices going on in my head too, ya know. And maybe I can't articulate my guilt trips into clever phrases or pinpoint experiences but I can tell you that guilt taught me a thing or two.1. If I don't pick up that clutter someone else is going to have to. When I was younger this meant my mom, whom after setting aside her career as an artist to raise 5 kids and nearly had (maybe did have at one point) a nervous breakdown from the lack of money, the accumulation of clutter and my argumentative nature. In my adult life this means the custodian, whom after leaving Vietnam as an educated person has to toil with 2 and sometimes 3 jobs to send his son (and seemingly only hope at respectability in this career driven society of ours) to college.2. Flour is not cheap and ingredients are not to be wasted! oh, the shame, the shame of ruining yet ANOTHER batch of gingerbread men.3. pre-marital sex is BAD. BAD! BAD! BAD! Offering yourself as anything less than a virgin to your someday husband is tantamount to giving someone a big bag of steaming compost with worms crawling through it for their birthday. The only thing worse than pre-marital sex is being gay.*it might be worth noting here that there was some guilt reprieve and gargantuan amounts of titillating conversation regarding what exactly you COULD do, short of having sex but even that was fraught with the anxiety of \"accidentally\" having sex. and I\"m still a little hazy on whether or not I can participate in oral sex. I'm assuming it's a no go, while (okay Catholics and Jewish people, I have to admit I've got it easier here) masturbating is okay AS LONG AS one doesn't start fantasizing about others while masturbating. Which you gotta hand it to them (wa-ha-ha) is that not the purest form of masturbation?4. Paper is meant to be used and re-used and re-used and re-used and re-used. Buying new paper is an intolerable opulence reserved for gluttonous pigs and ONLY gluttonous pigs. etc, etc, etc, so, did I find Portnoy's excessive guilt to be unreasonable or unreadable, not at all. I found it to be hilarious in it's familiarity. Matter of fact I found most of the book to be hilarious, which I hadn't anticipated. Some passages that I found particularly amusing are as follows:-when he ate pudding he shouldn't have, \"Well, good Christ, how was I supposed to know all that, Hanna? Who looks into the fine points when he's hungry? I'm eight years old and chocolate pudding happens to get me hot.-Talking to his \"doctor\", \"All I do is complain, the repugnance seems, bottomless, and I'm beginning to wonder if maybe enough isn't enough. I hear myself indulging in the kind of ritualized bellyaching that is just what gives psychoanalytic patients such a bad name with the general public\"-a child hood sexual fantasy, \"Her favorite line of prose is a masterpiece, 'Fuck my pussy, Fuckface, till I faint.' when I fart in the bathtub, she kneels naked on the tile floor, leans all the way over, and kisses the bubbles.\"-While observing \"goys\" at the skating rink, \"Jesus, look how guiltlessly they eat between meals! what girls!\"-about a non Jewish girlfriend, \".....played polo (yes, a games form on top of a horse!)But humor aside, I also appreciated some other aspects of the story. I loved the line, \"What I'm saying, Doctor, is that I don't seem to stick my dick up these girls, as much as I stick it up their backgrounds-as though through fucking I will discover America\". I remember standing alone in NYC (coming from a small town in Oregon) at age 17 and seeing the enormous variety of people and thinking how great it would be to be with the deaf man, the black man, the man in a wheel chair, the businessman, etc,etc,etc. Thinking how much I would KNOW if I could be with all of them (not simultaneously - gross! and not to worry, mom-should you come across this- I wasn't thinking sleep with them, just dates ya know, just some museums trips and a dinner here or there. okay maybe some light petting too, but really that's as far as that fantasy went). In the end I didn't broaden my horizons that way, I ended up dating one guy. One very nice Jewish boy. But still, I like the idea.And finally I'd like to say that I think I damn near cried at one point near the end and yes, I did also nearly cry this week when I saw a mud flap of that silhouetted naked lady because I so hate the \"ideal\" that society feels so comfortable imposing on us less than \"perfect\" females, and I was a little chocked up when my son said, \"I like having you for a mom\", and all of this near teary-ness might indicate a certain hormonal fluctuation orrrrrrrrr it might indicate that I'm a sensitive genius? consider. Regardless, I felt sorry for the pathetic schlep at one point.And thus concludes my thorough look at Portnoy's complaints plot points as well as the ubiquitous ME, ME, ME portion of my review."}, {"userName": "Lu\u00eds C.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34132356-lu-s-c", "userReview": "The case of an American Jew torn between the perfection imposed by parents and personal freedom, touches the universal! Alexander (at least for me) is not the prototype of the living Jew in the United States, suffocated by a severely exemplary education, where the parents choose the route to follow for their son, the latter who finds this life bland and demanding, who throws herself into the most insatiable sexuality (from his childhood), he is a universal being who exists everywhere in the world: he can be Christian, Jewish, Muslim... etc, he has doubts about the belief, and the importance of this propriety and these morals, he no longer believes in the foundation of the family or marriage.And so Alexander's monologue in front of his psychiatrist (the reader rather) continues with a lot of humor and g(roth)esque. Childhood stories (a \"big masturbator\") and sex stories (with the Monkey in particular). Alexander hesitates to choose between life according to the expectations of his family or the free life that escapes him in the impossibility of making a choice! So he has no life, he has an image, a very pale copy of a life. In addition he develops a very pessimistic vision of marriage, a tragicomic vision!Alexander touches us, captivates us with his vision of things, he does not deny his belonging or hates his parents, but he opposes certain uses or beliefs.Roth was able to present to us the soul of an American Jew without clich\u00e9s, with an excellent mastery of the character of his character, and with a humor (I would not say to the Woody Allen) full of irony (original)."}, {"userName": "G.R.

Then I realised I'd forgotten about Portnoy's Complaint.There is a school of thought which says to write well you have to write about what you know. On that basis I know I definitely did not like this book, although that unfortunately does not guarantee that I will excel at writing about it. With that in mind Philip Roth is official King of writing about what you know and his throne is probably made from giant piles of books in which he has written about being himself or a variant thereof. This book deals with several favorite Roth topics:Being male (tick)Being Jewish (tick)Being an American Jewish Male (tick)A mild obsession with the penis (tick)Moderate biographical references throughout his works of fiction thus allowing us to see the author but never really get to know him (tick).Not fitting into any of these categories, being neither male, Jewish, American or in possession of that vital bit of equipment (penis, not brain before anyone makes jokes) this book did not win me over. A monologue of sexual repression poured forth by the eponymous Alexander Portnoy, a young man who is so tied to the apron strings of his mother that he's only managed to liberate his right hand and his libido. Given the subject matter I think that it would be better dubbed a \"manologue\" rather than a monologue.The highlight of the book for many (and this forms a lynch pin of many non Goodreads reviews and critiques) is Alexander Portnoy's sexual adventures with a piece of raw liver. Man meat meets cold meat in a way which might give you disturbing nightmares about visiting the deli. The misused liver is then served up to the family as part of a delicious traditional Jewish recipe later that same day. Gehakte leber anyone? And don't even ask what the special ingredient in the schmaltz and gribenes is!"}, {"userName": "Michael Finocchiaro", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro", "userReview": "This is the book that made Philip Roth both famous and scandalous. Portnoy is a mother-obsessed sexual maniac and actually quite hilarious. Who else would have had his character masturbating with a cow liver other than the author of the equally darkly humorous Sabbath's Theater? This book and the reaction to it drives the Nathan Zuckerman series of books which all refer back to the public reaction with equal measures of awe and dismay. The book itself is a classic and extremely well-written as only Roth can write.RIP (1933-2018).

What a mistake. She was displeased with my choice in reading material, and wasn't shy about letting me know. This was many years before Philip Roth won the Pulitzer Prize, making him somewhat more respectable to the American Jewish community. To be frank, though, even if he had already won the Pulitzer at that time, Grammy likely still would have seen \"Portnoy's Complaint,\" and probably anything else by Roth, as a shanda fur die goyim and best avoided by her grandson. As an already somewhat lapsed Jew at the time, though, I found the novel hilarious, shocking and frighteningly accurate, if a bit exaggerated.At more than double the age I was then, I decided to revisit \"Portnoy's Complaint\" for the first time, partly because I want to see if it's held up for me after all these years, and partly to see how it compares to the handful of other Roth novels I've read in recent years, including \"The Anatomy Lesson\" and \"The Plot Against America.\" So what did I find? As an older and now completely lapsed Jew, I found \"Portnoy's Complaint\" hilarious, shocking and frighteningly accurate, if a bit exaggerated. It also stands heads and shoulders above the other Roth novels I've read. As far as I can tell, there's \"Portnoy's Complaint,\" and then there's everything else he's written.I won't bother saying much about the book's content here because either you've already read it don't need to be told about it, or you should read the book, and I don't want to ruin it for you by recounting the best parts. (Frankly, the whole book's great, and singling out the best parts would be a pretty daunting task.) But I do have one caveat: I'm not sure how well this book would resonate with anyone who didn't grow up as a male in a Jewish family in America. I'm not saying other people shouldn't read this book -- they should -- but I am saying that much of both its comedy and its meaningfulness likely will be lost on all readers who aren't male American Jews. As just one small example, only such a reader could truly appreciate the brilliance of a suicide note, from a son to his mother, mentioned in passing:\nMrs. Blumenthal called. Please bring your mah-jongg rules to the game tonight. Ronald\n\"Portnoy's Complain\" is chock-full of profanity (including judicious use of the dreaded c-word), sexual depravity (and not just the famous meat scene), and ethnic stereotypes (including a hilarious depiction of the home life of WASPs). I've seen some people criticize this book for being too much of a comedy, too prone to Borscht Belt-style humor. Well, yes, but so what? The book is intended as a comedy, and the entire novel even ends with a punchline -- and not just any punchline, but a punchline that wouldn't be out of place on a Catskills stage.Anyhow, there's no need for me to say much more about \"Portnoy's Complaint.\" Plus, I have an easier time writing lengthy reviews of books I hate than ones I love wholeheartedly. Much like Alexander Portnoy, I'm not very good at being positive and upbeat. I'm just glad that the book held up as well as it did for me after all these years. Sorry, Grammy."}, {"userName": "Deniz Balc\u0131", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13959560-deniz-balc", "userReview": "Yorumumu daha sonra girece\u011fim."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36555254-robin", "userReview": "The title is apt for this book, because the entire thing is a complaint, made by Alexander Portnoy to his shrink. Oh, boy.Initially I put this on my TBR list because Joe Goldberg, the well-read psychopath in Caroline Kepnes' You and Hidden Bodies lists it as his favourite book. A bit of a twisted road to get to Philip Roth's infamous, sexually explicit work that caused a big splash when published in 1969.While cleverly written and quite funny in some parts, the rant-like nature of this book got a little tired after a while, and soon it was apparent that the story arc wasn't going anywhere interesting for me.Portnoy complains mainly about his overbearing Jewish parents (particularly his mother - can you say Oedipus Complex?), his Jewishness, his attraction to shikses, and his inability to pick a nice girl and have a normal relationship. And round and round we go. There are some pretty over the top scenes which depict him wildly masturbating (to successful fruition) while his mother screams from the other side of the door.This was my introduction to Philip Roth.

What\u2019s with the smug smile on that face of yours? What\u2019s with that satisfied look? You think you\u2019re now a goy or something? Are you thinking of a shikse or something? Are you high? You think just because you wrote a bunch of anti-semitic, auto-erotic stuff you\u2019re some bigshot? What\u2019s the sense with that piece of crap? Don\u2019t you dare turn your back on me you balding Kike! You wanker! You kosher prick! You\u2026 oh, where\u2019s the sense in this? Come on, mate. Is this really just to ridicule society? What\u2019s the gist, the point, the essence? To say things which nobody has said before? Is it just anger, contempt? Sure, I get the whole defy the boundaries of society thing, to be rid of the cultural standards and stuff. Freedom from the restrictive paradigm! I get it, I do. Fuck society. Fuck culture, marriage, family, democracy, capitalism, sexual-restraint. Fuck them all! But is it just that? Why go through all the girlfriends? I bet that\u2019s boasting there, Philip. Just because you had cunt doesn\u2019t mean we wanna hear about it. All you did was give me a boner in some parts. That wasn\u2019t a very nice thing to do given all the whining coming with it. You\u2019re an asshole, Roth! You\u2019re worse. You\u2019re thinking of doing perverse stuff to your own Mother! That\u2019s going beyond the oedipal tendencies, bud. Are you suggesting that we should practice incest because fuck the society? Incest because fuck the law? You motherfucker! That\u2019s gross, man. Is that the point? What about all that wanking? Is is just to make me wanna wank myself? Well, you succeeded mate. I may have wanked somewhere in between reading your book. Satisfied, Roth? You corrupted a youth. If someone catches me doing the deed, Imma tell them I learned it from the venerated Philip Roth. But I\u2019m telling you, you didn\u2019t succeed with that whole incest thing. You stay out of my family! And really the liver? You thought up that it should be fed to a family? I bet you did that in real life. What is this semi-autobiographical? Because I\u2019m telling ya, some things here were a little too graphic to be made up. Come on, bud. Say it. I did all this when I was younger. There\u2019s a good boy. So you just wanted to share life experiences, eh? No? Then what is it? Ah, I think I\u2019ve got it. Now, Phil. Mind if I call you Phil? So is this really just another Catcher in the Rye, except you know, you have crazy substituting the teenage angst here. Is it really just I\u2019m too good for you stuff? Just another anarchy dude, another all that \u201cmy life, my rules\u201d crap. The world\u2019s your oyster kid. Joke\u2019s on you, it\u2019s not. What\u2019s with all the sexual stuff? To prove that sex is a natural instinct and shouldn\u2019t be so shameful? Sure, that\u2019s pretty good. But is that all? Defy life, sex is normal. Is that it? Bullshit, Phil! You may be a chronic-wanker, but you\u2019re not stupid enough to write a book about this stuff. This is all movie crap. This is the bread and butter of scriptwriters, not novelists. You\u2019ve got more pride than that. You\u2019ve won a Pulitzer for cryin out loud! Why write this? What are you trying to tell me? Why all the babble! Are you a Nazi? Are you trying to justify the holocaust? What is with this book? Is it to make me be a better man? Is it supposed to show the inadequacies of my complaints, the shallowness of it all? Are you using reverse psychology?! It won\u2019t work, boyo. We gentiles are a smarter breed than you give us credit for. You cunt! You sexist, racist, homophobic son of a woman. Are you trying to show us the thoughts of the superior Caucasian man? Hehe! Now I\u2019m the racist one. Sorry, Phil. Didn\u2019t mean to hurt ya there. But I\u2019m still stumped here. What\u2019s the big picture? What\u2019s it saying to me? Libido is libertarian? I guess I can work with that. Hahaha! Wait, humor won\u2019t work here, Phil. You wrote and book and I read it. You have to answer me here. No, you don\u2019t have the right to remain silent. No, you can\u2019t invoke your right to self-incrimination. Say it! Open up! Spill the beans! Let the cat out of the bag! Try to see the big picture, you say? Ah! I see! It\u2019s in the punch-line! What, no comment? So it\u2019s about the doctor. I get it now, sonny. You thought that you freed yourself from the chains of society. You broke everything, you howled! You didn\u2019t give a crap about anything. Heck, you even tore the tag off the mattress! But really, you weren\u2019t freed. The fact that you were talking to a shrink proved that you thought something was wrong with you. You say you didn\u2019t give a shit, but you put yourself under observation. You say you lived big, but you confined yourself with a mental-health professional. You were under invisible chains, your freedom was an illusion. Why the silence now, Phil? Say something. What? I\u2019m confusing you with Portnoy? But you wrote it, mate. Doesn\u2019t that sort of identify you with the protagonist? What? I\u2019m an asshole? Alright, whatever. You\u2019re the man. I\u2019m just saying, freedom from societal-norms is an illusion.

Essentially those who would not have him like historically against Jewish peoples (dude, you work for the mayor and are educated! You do what you want!). I am not Jewish and I wasn't alive in the '60s. Somewhere anyone is going to feel like that they don't belong. What I really liked about Portnoy's Complaint is the not fitting in the anyone should feel that way. You don't have to feel like you owe your family. How someone else feels about you is a lot about them. A lot of talking oneself into it doesn't hurt, I won't regret it later, what is the right thing to do. Sex as sex, not the whole damned future. You can live for the now and then still regret the past when the next now comes up. Or be afraid you are going to regret it. That can be anxiety inducing enough on its own. (If the book had been written a couple of decades later there would be worse things than disappointing your parents with no grandchildren.) The good thing about this book is that it is not easy to say for sure and pin Alexander Portnoy to one thing. Oh yeah, he felt sorry for himself, hemmed in and restrained. Unsatisfied always. He succumbed to worrying about what he should feel as much anyone else. He did believe that he was better than the Monkey (I liked the Monkey. If she became \"clingy\" and hoped for a new life outta Portnoy... Well, he might be her some day. Left alone out of years of pleasing only himself. Monkey chose her sexual freedom and later discovered the tragedy of shame. I wish she didn't have to feel shame! She could have been him before when younger. It's not fair thirty for her was old. He was 33!). The conquering getting back at them bullshit was boring and backtracking on the good stuff. The freedom with a price came to a conversational death by boring and big fat lie. It doesn't mean there wasn't anything else in there. I was just bored when it became about BEING Jewish instead of being any man. Besides, it doesn't feel like the truth! If you are going to be your own person, what does being Jewish have to do with the picture? Especially since you aren't religious, Portnoy? It was too good before. Me against them instead of Me I wish it didn't have to be against anyone. Sighs That would be soemthing that would mean something to me (wishing) instead of a funny story about a guy who can talk circles around what he really wants. He did talk circles. I liked how he slipped up and was confused about his omnipresent mama, to side with dad or not (were they the same or not?), his sensible and taken for granted sister.

La voglia di vivere e di essere libero, sembra affermare Alexander Portnoy, aspirazione che si esprime prevalentemente nell'ambiente creato dal dialogo tra caratteristiche sociali e familiari e desideri e qualit\u00e0 individuali: in questo caso, sessualit\u00e0, ebraismo, societ\u00e0 borghese e intellettualismo. E cos\u00ec la scrittura, sotto forma di monologo psicoanalitico, diventa un flusso che \u00e8 metafora della vita, dell'atto sessuale come liberazione di energia, dell'affermazione professionale come prova della potenza virile, del sarcasmo verso l'altro e del solipsismo come difesa da narcisismo e disprezzo di s\u00e9. \u201cChe cosa \u00e8 avvenuto del buon senso che avevo a nove, dieci, undici anni? Come ho fatto a diventare un tale nemico e fustigatore di me stesso? E cos\u00ec solo! Oh, cos\u00ec solo! Nient'altro che il s\u00e9! Rinchiuso in me stesso! Quali sono le parole che sceglie Portnoy per salvarsi da questo isolamento forzato, quale teatro inscena per rappresentare la sua emancipazione dalla schiavit\u00f9 dell'impotenza? Meshuggener inguaribile, uomo di successo e di cultura, ha in mente il solo obiettivo di vivere alla grande e inseguire, tra baseball e erotismo, ogni shikse che gli introduca le sue grazie e accolga la sua insaziabile fame di femmina, in una fantasmagoria della fica, la passera, dove la donna \u00e8 soggetto di fantasie, il corpo femminile oggetto di amore e odio, venerazione e maledizione, dipendenza e estasi: Portnoy \u00e8 un essere in balia di libido e pulsioni, tutte dirette alla femminilit\u00e0, al sesso femminile, in una mitologia orgiastica dove lo shlong, il putz, l'organo maschile, \u00e8 mediatore e totem di un incontro che si fa parodia linguistica della psicologia freudiana e del dispotismo della tradizione tout court. Tra farsa e tragedia edipica, Portnoy si rivela a seconda dei momenti infante sperduto con la nostalgia della madre che lo minaccia di evirazione con il coltello di cucina, giovane maschio che vede l'erezione come stato di divina prigionia e diviene soggetto di necessaria educazione all'onanismo sfrenato, uomo adulto virile e dominante che innalza contro la repressione puritana l'idolo del proibito, scelta negativa che conduce a una morale pansessuale e edonistica. Nella sua cronica insoddisfazione, nei suoi insuccessi iterati, Portnoy pensa se stesso come un mentecatto con una sofferenza significante e dignitosa, un ebreo infelice che disprezza se stesso, dove l'esagerazione viene eletta a stile esistenziale. Ogni confine \u00e8 pregiudizio, la vita \u00e8 desiderio illimitato, la relazione un dispiegamento narcisistico: la scrittura \u00e8 luogo dove pu\u00f2 prendere forma un rovesciamento anarchico del reale, evitando la negazione e superando nella dissolutezza la paura di crescere in un delirio dionisiaco connotato da oralit\u00e0 dissacrante e invettiva al turpiloquio. \u201cIl succo del mio ragionamento, Dottore, \u00e8 che non mi par tanto di ficcare il mio uccello in queste ragazze, quanto di ficcarlo nei loro ambienti sociali... come se scopando volessi scoprire l'America. Conquistare l'America, \u00e8 forse pi\u00f9 corretto\u201d. Il piacere dei sensi \u00e8 antidoto al soffocare angoscioso del quotidiano e l'irripetibilit\u00e0 dell'esperienza sessuale acquisisce una funzione liberatoria e rituale, nel trionfo di una ironia antivitalistica. Il Lamento di Portnoy \u00e8 un romanzo confessione pieno di comicit\u00e0 viscerale, con un eroe americano ibrido e privo di certezze, irregolare e asociale anche nel successo, in un racconto satirico che \u00e8 pi\u00f9 complesso e versatile di come appaia; genera il riso e la catarsi, tratta di colpa e trasgressione, risolve su differenti piani il conflitto tra coscienza e istinto, suggerendo nell'impossibile e disastrosa ricerca dell'altro l'esistere di un valore vitale e doloroso che pu\u00f2 restituire almeno parzialmente il senso della propria pienezza. Nello scandalo appassionato e nell'intenso pathos, un curioso e mai rassegnato interrogare.\u201cDottore, forse altri suoi pazienti sognano \u2013 ma io, guardi, a me le cose succedono per davvero, tutte. Io ho una vita priva di contenuto latente. A me i sogni mi succedono! Dottore, non m'\u00e8 riuscito di rizzarlo nello Stato di Israele! Beh, che gliene pare di questo come simbolismo, bubi?

God, it's probably shameful to admit that I AM PORTNOY, but it would be just like me to say that very thing and mirror the guilt of the guy in the book. You wish your parents could read this, especially my neat freak, worrywart mom. I think a lot of Catholic households and Jewish households are not a lot different. This shit is funny and real and insightful. If the rest of the book is as good as the first 50 pages then we shall be quite pleased.(Yes. I'm reading the old yellow paperback edition. $1 from Half Price.)Getting close to a third of the way in...What is it Dali said: \"Stop stealing my dreams?\" I say to Roth: \"You've stolen my life, the angst in my head.\" I'm sort of in a mindmeld with this book. The conflicting feelings over one's parents, the tugs of opposing impulses: to respect and abhor, to compromise and rebel. This book is making me appreciate the efforts of my own mother more, whereas lately I've been inclined to overemphasize her faults; the deficiencies passed from her to me. Many lovely ruminations, not just masturbation... Reading transfixed.I'm officially in awe of Roth, and the achievement of this book. Just surpassed the two-third mark in the evening after beginning this yesterday evening. The conflicts between outward respectability and inner desires; the baggage of youth; the rebellion against morality and tradition; the inner conflict (stated ostensibly as a therapy session); the anxiety and humiliation -- the insecurity of being the outsider, and of fighting against your own minority status; the grotesque beauty and brutality; the longing, the confusion, the pettiness, and the self-awareness thereof; the conflict of living two sets of values... This ALL SPEAKS to me. Roth is so focused, yet so diffuse. Every word of this is wise and sad and raw and real. This is referred to as a comic novel, but while there are laughs there's much more poignancy, for me. I just dig the shit out of this book. I mean, so much so that it might now be my favorite novel ever. But let's not get too hasty. Still going...OK, well, this had everything for me. EVERYTHING!

I thought to read the end as a commenter noted it was a shaggy dog story, which made me wonder what the punch-line was, but as I read about this woman he called \"the monkey,\" I became so furious in how he wrote of her with such hatred that I had to know more about their relationship, which took me back another section, and then another, till I'd finally been led to read the entire dang book. And while I was sure I'd write something hateful about Roth after first learning of his attitude towards the Monkey, leading me to foam at the mouth in outrage and plan to write up a summation of the evidence proving Portnoy's homosexuality, I've since not changed my mind about Portnoy, but come to see some humor in some of the events he relates, and so I can say it was worth reading this book if only for the passages on the perfect child and pianist Ronald Nimkin (p. 96), for which I give Roth kudos by enabling me to laugh about a suicide of all tragedies, and for the passage in which the Monkey accuses Portnoy of making her a lesbian by their fulfilling their mutual fantasy of sleeping with another woman. And so for these two wonderful moments, I give Portnoy two stars. But then, I disagree that all this had to offer was a shaggy dog ending. As a shaggy dog story, this was a rather lame one. Really, what I would have loved would be to have it be told from the Monkey's perspective. She is the true star of this tale. She is the one whose adventures and neuroses I want to follow. But I could never expect Roth to pull this off successfully considering his great antipathy for womankind. ****************************************************************(done at page 64) OK, I'm sick of Portnoy. I don't care about his testicles, I don't care where and how he masturbates, I don't care whom he thinks of to get off, I don't care that he doesn't believe in god, I don't care what will happen to his nagging mother, weak father, and pleading sister. I don't wish them ill: I simply don't care about them. May they rest in peace. Don't worry, I own the book.

Di questo parla Lamento di Portnoy.Se avete la (s)fortuna di provenire da una societ\u00e0 tradizionalista, con una forte impronta familistica, se avete la (s)fortuna di avere avuto dei genitori apprensivi, una madre affettuosa ma soffocante ed autoritaria, se avete la (s)fortuna di essere un uomo in tale societ\u00e0, se da voi ci si aspetta tanto (troppo), ebbene non vi servir\u00e0 molto per capire questo libro e quello che dice.Da bravo meridionale emigrato soddisfo molte delle condizioni suddette. Cos\u00ec non ho fatto alcuna fatica a immedesimarmi nel libro e rivedermi nella figura di Alexander Portnoy (ad onor del vero ci rivedo pi\u00f9 mio fratello maggiore, mi ha salvato l'essere terzogenito: sono cresciuto pi\u00f9 capafr\u00e9sca avendo subito meno attenzioni, quindi con meno interesse intorno e meno aspettative). Dalle figure genitoriali, alla rivalsa sessuale (la mappa mentale degli USA da colonizzare stato per stato non \u00e8 troppo dissimile da quella dell'Europa che avevo in mente nei primi del 2000), passando per il disagio delle proprie origini che si converte in motivo di superiorit\u00e0 in un ambiente esterno (studiatevi la categoria dei terroni fuggiaschi per capire cosa intendo), il malcelato amore per la propria cucina, l'affermazione non economica ma sociale in un ruolo \"giusto\" e tanto tanto altro. Insomma tante, troppe cose durante la lettura mi sembravano affini o addirittura autobiografiche, tanto da chiedermi se non fossi la reincarnazione di almeno una parte dell'anima di Roth (per me il romanzo \u00e8 autobiografico, ci scommetto quello che volete) posto che \u00e8 ancora in vita.Certo i distinguo non mancano. Mio padre non \u00e8 stitico, n\u00e9 mia madre \u00e8 cos\u00ec melodrammatica (anche se certe frasi sono in ciclostilato), e nessuno dei due pu\u00f2 essere considerato ignorante, anzi. N\u00e9 ho l'anafettivit\u00e0 nei rapporti di coppia di Portnoy. N\u00e9 tuttavia le mie origini possono essere ricondotte a popolazioni dalla leggendaria intelligenza (vi assicuro per\u00f2 che non sono tonto). Per\u00f2, devo ammettere, nonostante Portnoy sia un po' stronzo, ipocrita, egoista non riesco proprio a non avere un moto di simpatia nei suoi confronti.E alla fine il messaggio di Roth \u00e8 chiaro, usando l'espediente psicanalitico: dalle tue origini non ti ci stacchi, che l'imprinting \u00e8 qualcosa che ti porti dietro per tutta la vita e con cui ci devi convivere dovunque tu sia.

The book was Marieke Hardy pick of a classic and it received such high praise by the whole panel, describing it as funny, awkward, rude and a work of a genius.Portnoy\u2019s Complaint is a one sided conversation between Alex Portnoy and his psychoanalyst, of growing up in a Jewish household with loud, workaholic and overprotective parents, his sexual awakening, his career and his failure to commit to a lasting relationship.I do agree with the panel, it was hilarious in some parts. I laughed so hard hearing Alex reminisce of the time when he was a teen living at home. His father\u2019s battle with constipation. And Alex trying to find a discreet place to release his sexual urges, without his smothering mother knocking on the bathroom wanting to know why Alex is taking so long. The excuses that he came up with and the whole drama surrounding these episodes were just hilarious. His parents were delightfully over the top. They remind me of George and Jerry\u2019s parents from Seinfeld.In my opinion, Alex\u2019s complaints as a young boy of his parent\u2019s behaviour were worthy of a complaint. They were tremendously suffocating, living at home with them and under their guarded eye, I could totally understand Alex\u2019s frustration for space and independence. But his complaints carried into his adult life that eventually he started to sound like a whinger. So many times I felt like telling him to just suck it up, grow up and stop acting like a baby.

Niente da fare: tutto ci\u00f2 che scrive quest'uomo \u00e8 pura letteratura - o almeno \u00e8 questa la sensazione che ho avuto ogni volta che ho terminato la lettura di una sua opera.Le 220 pagine di Lamento di Portnoy sono lo sfogo, sotto forma di soliloquio, di un giovane uomo che inveisce contro le convinzioni che la religione radica in una societ\u00e0 - in questo caso si tratta di quella ebraica, ma il concetto pu\u00f2 essere esteso a tutte le altre - e le conseguenze che esse hanno sulla vita di un bambino, poi adolescente, poi uomo. Alexander Portnoy, sul lettino del suo analista, d\u00e0 libero sfogo a tutto ci\u00f2 che gli passa per la mente e le sue elucubrazioni, che prendono vita dai ricordi e dai pi\u00f9 disparati aneddoti servendosi di salti temporali da far impallidire i pi\u00f9 impavidi lettori, sono in totale armonia tra loro. Ecco la peculiarit\u00e0 di Roth: ogni suo romanzo \u00e8 un'architettura, ogni incastro \u00e8 l\u00ec dove deve stare e la sensazione che dona la lettura di una sua opera \u00e8 comparabile ad un orgasmo della letteratura. A proposito di orgasmo: il sesso \u00e8 l'ossessione di Alexander Portnoy, croce e delizia della sua esistenza. La figura della madre \u00e8 onnipresente: una madre ebrea che ha un qualcosa di vagamente tirannico della quale lui cerca di liberarsi. E poi c'\u00e8 il padre, afflitto da stitichezza cronica, succube della moglie. In questo lamento lungo un libro, Alex se la prende soprattutto con la religione ebraica che ha tentato di plasmarlo e forse un po' ci \u00e8 riuscita, in fondo, perch\u00e9 tutto ci\u00f2 che vuole \u00e8 scrollarsi di dosso certe idee che si porta dentro fin da bambino. E questo sfogo tumultuoso trascina il lettore in momenti di pura ilarit\u00e0 che divertono e rendono la lettura un'esperienza fuori del comune, come solo Roth sa fare.\"Dottor Spielvogel, non \u00e8 per niente un sollievo abbandonarsi al biasimo - il biasimo \u00e8 di per s\u00e9 sofferenza, ovviamente - nondimeno, cosa avevano questi genitori ebrei, cosa, da riuscire a convincere noialtri ragazzini ebrei di essere da una parte principi, rari come gli unicorni, geniali, brillanti e belli come mai nessuno nella storia dell'infanzia... redentori e perfezione assoluta da una parte, e dall'altra molesti, incompetenti, scriteriati, imbelli, egoisti, perfidi stronzetti ingrati!\""}, {"userName": "Julie Ehlers", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2120450-julie-ehlers", "userReview": "A round of applause for Portnoy\u2019s Complaint. I can only imagine how daring and groundbreaking this book must have felt when it was first released in the late 1960s. An entire novel written as a rant to the narrator\u2019s psychoanalyst! Imagine! And what\u2019s more, the book manages to keep up its energy and momentum all the way through\u2014it\u2019s entertaining and funny, and insightful in the way only something truly groundbreaking can be. Honestly, despite all the responses and imitations this book no doubt engendered, I think Portnoy\u2019s Complaint will always be in a category all its own, and I mean that in a good way.Really too bad about all the misogyny. My appreciation was somewhat tempered by the fact that this book was clearly written under the impression that women just aren\u2019t really people in the same way men are. (There was definitely racism and homophobia too, but the misogyny was especially pervasive.) On the plus side, it really made it clear how far we\u2019ve come since then. Bless all the women writers who\u2019ve found their voices since the publication of Portnoy\u2019s Complaint\u2014knowing they\u2019re all out there made it possible for me to enjoy this book without succumbing to the rage it could have easily engendered otherwise. Sincere congratulations, Portnoy\u2019s Complaint, for being so daring so many years ago and such an amusing relic now.

I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted illegally.)Regular readers will remember that I'm in the middle of a long-term literary project right now, to read all eleven novels making up Philip Roth's autobiographical \"Zuckerman cycle\" in order to better understand the Postmodernist Era they discuss, from its start (right around Kennedy's assassination) to its end (9/11); but since so many of at least the early novels in the series concern themselves so directly with Roth's first big mainstream hit, 1969's filthy and funny Portnoy's Complaint, I thought it would be instructive to read that as well, to better understand the way that Roth's life changed because of it. For those who don't know, after an early start as a traditional, academic-style Late Modernist writer who was getting published in The New Yorker in the early '60s, this hilarious look at the sexual dysfunctions inherent in the New York Jewish lifestyle, and its inherent clashes against the prevailing \"let it all hang out\" countercultural mood, was exactly what mainstream America needed at the exact moment they needed it, just like Woody Allen was providing in cinemas at the same time; and so not only was it a hit with the usual intellectual crowd, but it broke through to become a massive general hit, an eventual Hollywood film, and even a tittering codeword among the culture at large, right at the same time that his fellow young New Yorker author John Updike was doing the same thing with his saucy novel Couples (the very first mainstream book to discuss the topic of suburban wife-swapping, after obscenity laws in the US getting relaxed just a few years earlier).And to be fair, this is still a dirty, dirty book, with it easy to understand why merely carrying a copy around back then was enough to signal to anyone else that you could \"dig it,\" which much like Woody Allen takes the image of the nebbish, self-deprecatory Jewish city boy and almost accidentally turns it into a new type of nerdy sex symbol, as we follow poor Portnoy's adventures as first an onanistic teen and then a goy-obsessed young man, flailing about in the high-minded hippie atmosphere around him but still managing to have crazy sex on a regular basis anyway. And it's easy to see why so many older Jews got so upset by this book too; because not only does it lay out a lot of the quiet little dysfunctional moments of the Jewish community to a large Christian audience, a direct predecessor to Seinfeld that I've discussed in more depth in my Zuckerman write-ups, but indeed a lot of its humor derives explicitly from all the neurotic hangups that were created among Roth's generation by all their uptight, obsessed-with-appearances, Holocaust-surviving parents, making it not just a funny sex comedy but an astute look at the first generation of Jews to grow up after World War Two, and the clashes that occurred when they first came of age in the countercultural '60s, which I'm sure made it even more of a must-read among the young hipsters of the time. A great, moving, blush-inducing novel that still holds up really well to this day, read it to understand what was getting your parents all squirmy in the years that they were having you."}, {"userName": "Tristan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3781470-tristan", "userReview": "So this - or so I'm informed - is where the archetype of the self-hating, sexually repressed, neurotic Jew originated. Hmm. A funny confessional book (absolutely crammed with that glorious Yiddish), Portnoy's Complaint certainly is historically significant for its rambunctious iconoclasm, although I doubt -apart from its at the time largely unspoken observations of the restrictions and expectations Jewish identity brings with it - it will have much staying power compared with others of its \"genre\" in the future. Portnoy never solidifying himself in my eyes as a particularly memorable character also didn't exactly help in this area. I feel I have delved in the mindscape of that kind of character countless of times. Perhaps at the time of publication (1969, genious marketing decision eh?) he was something fresh. Not so much now. 45 years of popular culture have seen to that.It's probably rather clear by now I didn't really connect with this, although I recognize it is well-written and structurally sound. My theory is that this is a clear case of familiarity breeding (oh so subtle, but unignorable) contempt. After all, the unending expounding on -in certain circles risqu\u00e9 -sexual indulgences has been a rich subject ever since Henry Miller did it - with guns blazing, sort of speak - in the 1930s, laying the groundwork for everyone else after that. I've read my fair share of all that in my twenties. Needless to say, by now I am beset by a weariness of the subject altogether. There is no great insight to be gained from it anymore. Yes, human sexuality can be aberrant, disgusting and messy, and I'm sure one can explicate its coarse mechanisms in excruciating detail. Can we move on now? Frankly, it's become tedious. Sexually explicit language (while it can elicit great hilarity if used appropiately) just has lost its power to shock or impress. For me personally, my taste has evolved towards barely noticed innuendo and symbolism, so there is not much in it for me anymore. That's what's called \"maturing\", I guess.Talking about age and its vicissitudes, I am rather surprised this came out when Roth was already 36, since it very much feels like a book a twenty something year old - admittedly a highly intelligent one - would write. Pretty reasonable to assume Woody Allen attentively perused it and viewed it as a template for some of his own work, as well. He definitely mined its contents for all it was worth. So thank you, Mr. Roth, good Sir! You were -at least partly - the impetus for some terrific cinematic concoctions. Okay, that's enough of my kvetching for now. Do excuse me. I feel the irresistible urge to put on 'Annie Hall' for the umpteenth time."}], "description": "With a new Afterword by the author for the 25th Anniversary edition.\"Touching as well as hilariously lewd....
