For example, when Mowat said he had spent two summers and a winter studying wolves, the Toronto Star, a newspaper in Toronto, Canada, wrote that Mowat had only spent 90 hours studying the wolves. Mowat has admitted he doesn\u2019t let the facts get in the way of a good story.While this may be very disappointing - personally, I like to be able to trust the information in a non-fiction book and dislike the modern fashion of \u201ccreative non-fiction\u201d. The world as it is is fascinating without need of embellishment. True, sometimes situations need to be simplified in order to keep a storylike manageable, but the problem with making too free with the facts is that everything in the story then becomes a fairy-story. Defenders of the techniques would correctly argue \u2013 as with Farley Mowat\u2019s books \u2013 that massaging the facts to serve a greater mission is admissable. This is what politicians and lobbyists and spin-doctors also propound. The result is that all public discourse becomes debased.Mowat\u2019s first book was \u201cPeople of the Deer\u201d published in 1952. It tells the story of his time with the Ihalmiut, a group of Inuit (Eskimo) who live on the great Barrens plains of northern central Canada in an area now known as the Kivalliq Region of present-day Nunavut. They are the only Inuit not to live by the sea. Caribou (reindeer), not seal meat, is an important part of their diet.When Mowat lived with them in the late 1940s, he estimated that the Ihalmiut had numbered 7,000 in 1886, down to 40 by 1947-48. By 1950, only 30 remained. Their destruction was due to changes in their hunting dynamics (from hunting for food to hunting for furs), introduction of flour and sugar into their diet (through fur trader contact), disease (probably diphtheria), the failure of their primary food source (barren-ground caribou), and sickened sled dogs (possibly rabies).It was Mowat\u2019s book, \u2018People of the Deer\u201d that rescued the Ihalmiut from extinction. His book made Mowat into a literary celebrity and without its publication the Canadian government could have conveniently continued to ignore these people.Instead, Mowat\u2019s indignation, his explanations of the ways of the people and his entertaining storytelling contributed to the shift in the Canadian government\u2019s Inuit policy that \u2013 despite many cruel blunders \u2013 did eventually ensure their survival.So if some of the information in \u201cPeople ofthe Deer\u201d is oversimplified or just plain wrong (as revealed by later studies that have had the luxury of longer research time and greater research dollars) perhaps Mowat can be forgiven for deciding that reaching a wide audience by entertaining them was more important than academic exactness. His works have been translated into 52 languages and he has sold more than 14 million books.For more reviews, essays and stories, please visit my website:Serendipities of a Writer's life www.dennisonberwick.info"}, {"userName": "Book Concierge", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge", "userReview": "People of the Deer\n \u2013 Farley Mowatt4****From the Forward - On an evening when the sun hovered above the horizon\u2019s lip, I sat beside a man who was not of my race, and watched a spectacle so overwhelming in its magnitude that I had no words for it.Below us, on the undulating darkness of the barren plains, a tide of life flowed out of the dim south and engulfed the world, submerged it so that it sank beneath a living sea. The very air was heavy with the breath of life itself. There was a sound of breathing and of moving that was like a rising wind. It was as if the inanimate and brutal crust of rock had been imbued with the essential spark and had risen from its ageless rigidity to claim the rights of life.Farley Mowatt went into the vast Barren Plains of North central Canada to study the caribou, and the Ihalmiut people who depended on \u201cthe deer\u201d for their very existence. He lived among them in the late 1940s, when their tribe had dwindled from several thousand in about 1900 to less than 50 individuals in 1947. Mowatt examines the various factors that led to the demise of The People of the Deer in this fascinating book.He spends a significant part of the book imparting some of the traditional stories of the Ihalmiut people, and when so doing, uses a completely different style and syntax. I felt as if I were sitting by a campfire, listening to an oral history; I was captivated and intrigued. But I still preferred those section when Mowatt was writing as himself. His writing about the landscape is poetic, and puts me smack dab in the middle of the Barrens with him. For example:There was an absolute and tangible silence, broken only by the fluid dip of paddles and the gentle mutter of water underneath the bow of the canoe. The lake itself was frozen in the dead, unearthly grip of perfect calm.Islands rose suddenly before us, like surfacing sea monsters. They appeared soundlessly, lifted clear of the horizon, then floated faintly in the sky as their mirage images dissolved. The shore drew away from us and twisted so that its low, uncertain progress gave us no clear conception of whether it was one mile or ten miles away. Angkuni lost all semblance of reality and of concrete form. Its shores and islands had an amorphous quality which defied the eye and left the mind with no clear memory of what has passed astern of the canoe.The events described in the book occurred nearly 70 years ago, and I have little idea how things may have changed (or if they have changed at all) for the Ihalmiut and other native peoples. I could not help but think about global warming, the loss of habitat, the expansion of technology, etc. in the 21st century. The time of the People of the Deer must surely be past, and that saddens me."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "I read this book for class and found it to be slightly outdated, but very gripping and well-written."}, {"userName": "LeeAnn Heringer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3013237-leeann-heringer", "userReview": "Twenty-first century man doesn't goes out into the wilderness without a flight plan, GPS, satellite phones, emergency SOS beacons, a corporate sponsor.

During his life, Mowat was quite bitter that his ability to lie and distort was never given the full recognition that it deserved. He was especially infuriated at the praise lavished on Truman Capote's new genre of \"nonfiction novels\" asserting that his works contained far more falsehood's than any of Capote's.The literary community in Canada was not impressed. They dismissed Mowat as a talentless writer who produced nature books for children. Desperate to preserve his reputation for posterity, Mowat left vast quantities of his letters, drafts, and journals so that academics would be able to establish the true magnitude of his falsehoods. Once the research began, Mowat's reputation soared. When he was alive the critics noted that for thirty years in succession, he had published a book describing the previous three years that he had passed in some exotic location such as the glacier fields north of the Arctic Circle or the uninhabited Siberian steppes. They assumed that Mowat had often stretched twelve month trips to 24 or 36 months. They were stunned to discover that Mowat's three year trips had almost invariably taken place in less than six weeks. Naturally, when the critics discovered what Mowat had done, they rallied to his side. They noted that Mowat's lurid and wildly inaccurate tales of environmental danger, destruction of rare species and mass starvation of Inuit, Dene and Eskimos had prompted Canada's government to respond aggressively to every problem. The hunting of endangered species was banned while projects to build pipelines were shelved. The People of the Deer addressed the great distress in the 1950s of Canada's native peoples who lived north of the tree line. The Inuit and Dene of the far north typically lived in small nomadic bands comprised of 50 or fewer people. They slept in tents in the summer and igloos in the winter. They had no electricity, running water, schools or hospitals. In Following the publication of this book, the Canadian government decided to settle all the nomadic groups to larger centres having modern infrastructures, schools and health services. Native populations have soared, illiteracy is now a thing of the past and the natives are now practicing trades and professions.The People of the Deer is one of the very few books ever written by Mowat whose value outlived its political usefulness. This is because Mowat did spend at least 12 months in the territories he described which was not something that would ever happen again. I endorse the reading of this book to anyone able to borrow it from a library. If you find that you must either buy it at a bookstore or download from Amazon, I would advise you not to because you run the risk of clicking on the wrong title and thus spending money on one of his other books."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802652-debbie", "userReview": "I'm interested so many people give this book shining reviews. Did they read it recently, or are they remembering enjoying it back in their youth?A member of my book club had heard of it, so we chose it to try something off the beaten path, so to speak. But I soon found the book terribly dated with politically incorrect language (half breed, primitive peoples, etc.) and the writing painfully pretentious. On any given page I found sentences such as \"The sterile, unbreathing land of winter breathed deeply now, and its breath was that of a strong woman in the grip of passion.\" (p. 21) Oh, come on!But I don't think its the dated language or the mediocre writing that has placed this book in the dust bin of history,(or that it should have!) but the fact that Farley Mowat is basically discredited as a non-fiction writer. (See http://www.salon.com/people/bc/1999/0... for a sample rant.)There are some interesting stories in the books - which might be true - and Mowat's heart seems to be in the right place, but I'm guessing that these days there are better books out there about the indigenous people of northern Canada."}, {"userName": "Bob Newman", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72341080-bob-newman", "userReview": "\"...now that the caribou are gone....\"A large number of Western ethnographers have gone forth to study various peoples all around the world, in both developed and developing countries. How many of them were able to write such a powerful work as PEOPLE OF THE DEER ? Not many. Farley Mowat, a well-known Canadian writer, trained as a zoologist, includes beautiful description of the nature he encountered in his two year sojourn in the part of (modern) Nunavut back in the 1940s when that part of North America was scarcely known to outsiders. He befriended some of the Ihalmiut, the caribou-hunting, inland Inuit (once known as 'Eskimos' which is actually an Indian term). He learned some of their language, lived with them, hunted with them, and described most aspects of their lives. A third part of the book concerns his anger at what happened to them. The Ihalmiut suffered the fate of so many peoples in history (and no doubt in pre-history), brushed aside by a more powerful group. In this case, white disease, white commercial interests, white missionaries, and white rule from faroff doomed them to extinction with few white people being aware of what happened. The Ihalmiut may or may not be extinct....I don't know....but certainly their traditional way of life died many years ago and they became 'wards of the state', moved around, led to eat different food, and prey to white ideas of 'progress'. Are there many caribou today ? I don't know, but even at best, modern life would dictate another lifestyle. Never mind controversy. This is a most powerful book, full of beautiful and fascinating details about the lives and beliefs of a people most of us will never see. I found it wonderful, a great read and recommend it to anyone with an ounce of curiosity about other cultures. My edition had attractively drawn portraits of the people he met.

However, it is truly beautifully written about the death of a people. The author - who lived with the tribe for 2 years to attempt to understand the people from their point of view - did an expert job of recanting what happened, how it happened. He makes a very determined attempt to see things differently than his point of view. My opinion is that he succeeds in doing so. Though a sociologist, the book is luridly written. It is easy for one to visualize what the writer is experiencing. In modern times, you'd expect such good writing from travel journalist/book writers. Here it is holey unexpected and appreciated.

Mowat lived with the Ihalmiut people for several years and learned their language. The Ihalmiuts are Inuits that lived in the \"Barrens\" west of Churchill in Canada, and they depended on Caribou for their survival. There was a lot to admire about the Ihalmiut culture. They treated their children with love, and never used corporal punishment. Ihalmiut people shared their food, and tools generously with their neighbors.

I feel like I am reading the transcript of a 1970s wildlife documentary and not the story of a group of people. The main characters of the story might as well be caribou and not human beings for all the story really goes into any details about them or their emotional lives, as opposed to just the bare bones of their survival and surroundings, i.e. their behavioural adaptations to the north.

It was excellent and made me hunger to read another, which I just did with People of the Deer.In 1886, the Ihalmiut of northern Canada numbered 7,000 souls; by 1946, when 25-year-old Farley Mowat travelled to the Arctic, their population had dwindled to only 40. Living among them, he observed the millennia-old migration of the caribou and endured the bleak winters, food shortages and continual, devastating intrusions of interlopers bent on exploiting the Arctic. In this seminal book, Mowat details a genocide wrought by misunderstanding and neglect. Debated long after its publication, this powerful story of the Ihalmiut continues to haunt the Canadian conscience.This is a very powerful and extremely depressing story about the extinction brought on to a race of people by, of course, the white man. Mowat does a great job in telling the Ihalmiut story. He did not just observe them but took the time to learn their language, at least a small portion of it, as they did not speak English, and lived among them. Learning a little of their language allowed him to hear the Ihalmiut's story of the good times, when the deer (caribou) numbered in the thousands.Mowat was very thorough in telling the story of their destruction, how the white man came and set up trading posts to trade food, guns and ammo for white fox pelts. This first contact, of course, brought disease to the people. When the price of fox furs fell, the trading posts just closed up shop. The people would go hungry and the disease could take a better hold of them.The caribou, their main source of food and fuel, started to fade in numbers. He watched as the people he had grown so fond of died off.This was Farley Mowat's first book and is extraordinary. Mowat not only tells us of the problems the people face through missionaries, the Canadian government and even the RCMP, but offers solutions at the end. You can sense Mowat's inner anger seething all the way through the book.He made another trip to visit the Ihalmuit in 1958 where he apparently follows up on what happened to those first people he met. I'm not sure if I'm up for that one but do want to read more stories by him. I'll be looking for a happier story, though.People of the Deer is really a must read for any Canadian."}, {"userName": "K.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/861629-k", "userReview": "FASCINATING!!! Stayed up last night to finish this amazing book. I have to admit that I'm not a very good non-fiction reader and usually I would especially be sleeping while trying to read a biological/anthropological/ zoological/conservationist-like slanted book--but this author is a really amazing author with the ability to submerge his readers into the world he's inhabiting--making you care about the people or animals or places he's writing about it a very intimate way. I really don't know how to describe why I find his works so fascinating and readable when they're so different from what I'm usually reading. It must be that I find his style/wit/mind-set to be real, honest and lovable. This book had me everywhere from gagging to laughing to crying to angry. It is the story of the author's 2 year experience with the Ihalmiut, an indiginous Canadian-arctic people now either all the way or nearly extinct. His thoughts about their diet (and our awful de-natured white-man diet) had me wondering if Sally Fallon had read this book in preparation to write \"Nourishing Traditions.\" His thoughts on how they raised their children had me wondering if Oliver and Rachel DeMille read this in preparation for writing \"A Thomas Jefferson Education.\" His thoughts on how they treated each other and their lack of the \"anger\" emotion had me wondering if the Arbinger people had read this book in preparation for writing their great books. It was simply a fabulous experience and I look forward to reading more of his works, as I have equally appreciated the others I have already read. I checked out his biography on wikipedia just now. Apparently some have doubted his stories enough to call him a liar and a fake. I wonder. What would be his motivation? Self-aggrandizement? That doesn't ring true to me--but what do I know? As I read his books, I don't see a reason for him doing such a thing, although it could be. However, his voice just seems so honest and fervent. I'll take a chance on him and believe the best.

Specifically, he describes his relationship with the Ihalmuit people (people of the deer), a specific group of Inuit who lived in the interior of the arctic. These people numbered in the thousands at the end of the 19th century, and by 1947 when Mowat went up to live with them, they numbered well under 100 (pretty fucked up). He learns their language and seems to earn their trust, and through this he describes living with them, his observations of their way of life, many of their customs and history, and much of their spiritual beliefs. I learned a lot from this book-the importance of deer in all that these Inuit do (food, clothing and shelter), the destructiveness of white mans interference (traders who change the way the Inuit live and then leave them in the lurch), the interesting communal lives that they lead, and the fantastical spirits they believe in and guide them in their lives. This is a book every Canadian should read (and it wouldn't hurt Americans to read it either!). In fact, as I read it I was surprised that it had not been required reading in high school. It is a book that could open the reader's eyes to the plight of indigenous people in this country, it teaches us some of our own painful history. I always find it interesting to read books about other cultures-what is so sad about this book is that this particular culture, full of kind, hardworking people, has now pretty much died out. Its a cautionary tale of immense importance, although unfortunately was to late for most of Canada's indigenous populations to benefit from, and was also ignored rather than strictly heeded.

Of course this is Farley Mowatt's truth, a person's truth is to some extent only their own. He does have a goal to influence government policies in regards to native peoples, animal populations and environmental usage; and he has been to some extent successful in this. He has also been successful in educating and influencing public opinion in regards to the above subjects. I want to put a quote in this review from Wiki:\"His stories are fast-paced, gripping, personal, and conversational.\" This description is exactly the way I found \"People of the Deer\" to read. The book also includes drawings of the Eskimo people he got to know personally and spent time living with.

Since the Ilhamiut follow the caribou (deer) as their only means of survival, when that migration becomes challenged because of encroaching business, government and missionary efforts, the results have become disastrous. Mowat relates how they make their close, their diet, their family structures, their folklore and mythologies, their terrors, their hunting genius, their hospitality, their language characteristics, their people up close, and he is such a gifted, expert writer that this study should, I believe, be studies as a prototype for creative non-fiction, as a treatise on preserving native cultures, and as a record and tribute to a great but ignored people.

There is a great sadness that pervades the book, as the contact with white people has been terribly destructive to their society, and there were only a few dozens people left at the time of his contact with him. Their destruction was brought about by contact with European diseases, the convincing of people to hunt fox and other animals for fur to trade instead of hunting caribou for meat and the subsequent precipitous exit of the fur traders during the depression which resulted in mass starvation, and the massive extermination of the caribou by people south of the Barrens.

He has a storyteller\u2019s flair and a lovely grasp of narrative flow.People Of The Deer was published in 1952 after Mowat spent two years with the Ihalmiut people of Canada, Inuit who live inland and traditionally depend on the reindeer as their main source of livelihood. He was accepted by Ihalmiut, got to know them and became part of their everyday lives and they, his. This ability of Mowat\u2019s to integrate himself into another culture is one of his greatest strengths, given the kind of books he writes.Like many of his books, People Of The Deer is an indictment, this time an indictment of the treatment of the Ihalmiut by the white man. Mowat\u2019s books are often like protest songs or punk songs, or like Michael Moore\u2019s movies but subtle. He certainly pulls punches but, in my opinion, it makes his points all the more poignant. And his point always, always comes across in full.An excellent book and a truly good read."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17928588-rebecca", "userReview": "Mowat travelled far and through hardship to learn the stories of the Ihalmiut. What lives these arctic people led and how fascinating to learn about them! They were married to the land and relied upon the caribou body and soul. \"It was as if the endless lines of the deer imparted to Ohoto something of their own immeasurable vitality. It was borne in upon me again that the affinity between the Ihalmiut and the deer was more than a merely physical tie. It was as if the People were required to eat the spirit of Tuktu (deer), the ephemeral presence which comes when the deer are in the land, and vanishes when the deer vanish.\"I enjoyed the two chapters about Kakumee, that \"evil genius of the Barrens\" immensely. \"Kakumee's face was like a masterful devil-mask that had weathered and cracked through the centuries under the storms and the sun...Kakumee looked at me and smiled and his smile was as cold as that of a hangman.\" Mowat is a good story teller and his descriptions of the Ihalmiut he meets as well as the barren country he travels both compel and excite the imagination."}, {"userName": "Braedy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38772621-braedy", "userReview": "This book gives you an answer to your question \"What did our ancestors really do to the aboriginal people?\"Farley Mowat takes us on an adventure back in time to the Barren Lands, living alongside a small group of Ihalmiut, a community of inland Inuit called The People. He shares important and fantastic stories of their culture, customs, legends, and constant struggle to adapt to an ever-changing world.There are areas of this book that deserve 5 stars, and there are some that deserve a 3, so that's where I come up with the 4 star rating.

This book was written in the 40's when Mowat was in his early 20's. What amazed me the most about this book was the lived experience Mowat had. He had an experience none of us ever will. The people that he lived with are now gone. What saddens me is that as a white person, we ultimately killed off an entire group of people with our ignorance and selfishness. That is what makes this book phenomenal for me - understanding through our mistakes what we did wrong, and what we need to do better in regards to cultural acceptance. Several chapters are focused on dreams/visions, I wasn't really interested in this part of the book, I was more interested in Mowat's experiences. And what an experience he had! The writing and wording is a bit off, but one needs to remember, this book was written 70 years ago."}, {"userName": "Monty", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/285761-monty", "userReview": "I read the 1951 edition thinking I would be reading an anthropologically oriented book about indigenous people in Canada. Instead I was treated to a treatise on one man's experience living/traveling with a group of native people in the Barrens, people whose main source of food and life was deer. If not for the threatened extinction of these people this book would not have been written according the last two chapters of the book where the author states his prime purpose of writing the book was to find a way to force the Canadian government to do something to prevent the extinction of these people, to do something similar to what the Greenland government did for the native people there. I did get to learn about some of the beliefs and customs of the people Mowat lived with, and was amazed at the extensive creation myth he recounted--it is completely different from other creation stories I have read. Anyway, I enjoyed book."}, {"userName": "Enik\u0151", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1195946-enik", "userReview": "I'm really glad I read this book, but not because it was funny or entertaining. It was a sad book, or melancholy to say the least. There were a lot of interesting episodes in it, some of them quite humourous, like the scene of the author's first meal with the People. But underneath all the descriptions of the life and beliefs of the People of the Deer, there is doom and gloom. I would really like to find a copy of The Desperate People to read more about them and to find out what happened to them, but I am almost afraid to find out.This is definitely a book that people should read if they have any sense of social consciousness at all - actually , they should read it to develop some! I recommend this book to everyone, especially to Canadians, since this is about stuff that happened in our own Northern backyard."}, {"userName": "J", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4204813-j", "userReview": "I am currently reading this book for school and am having a tough time understanding it. I find it hard for me to grasp all the information when so much is presented. At this point, the book is frustrating me and I am not very fond of it. Can anyone help me out with chapter summaries or something of the sort? I really do like books like these, but find it easier to understand when they are presented shortly and clearly which from what I have read of this book is not the case. Over the summer, I had to read the book SALT by Mark Kurlansky. Although a lot of the information was interesting, it was presented in the MOST boring way possible. I could not stand reading SALT because it just went on and on. So, as I asked before, PLEASE SOMEONE HELP! THANKS!!"}], "description": "In 1886, the Ihalmiut people of northern Canada numbered seven thousand; by 1946, when Farley Mowat began his two-year stay in the Arctic, the population had fallen to just forty. With them, he observed for the first time the phenomenon that would inspire him for the rest of his life: the millennia-old migration of the Arctic's caribou herds. He also endured bleak, interminable winters, suffered agonizing shortages of food, and witnessed the continual, devastating intrusions of outsiders bent on exploitation. Here, in this classic and first book to demonstrate the mammoth literary talent that would produce some of the most memorable books of the next half-century, best-selling author Farley Mowat chronicles his harrowing experiences. People of the Deer is the lyrical ethnography of a beautiful and endangered society. It is a mournful reproach to those who would manipulate and destroy indigenous cultures throughout the world. Most of all, it is a tribute to the last People of the Deer, the diminished Ihalmiuts, whose calamitous encounter with our civilization resulted in their unnecessary demise.", "title": "People of the Deer", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72530.People_of_the_Deer", "average": 4.05, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328076084l/72530.jpg", "reviews": 79, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/41013.Farley_Mowat", "name": "Farley Mowat"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "History", "Cultural", "Anthropology", "Environment"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72530.People_of_the_Deer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/329536.People_of_the_Deer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72533.People_of_the_Deer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22017074-people-of-the-deer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72659.Never_Cry_Wolf", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/785656.Owls_in_the_Family", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/546693.Woman_in_the_Mists", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/291179.The_Dog_Who_Wouldn_t_Be", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/785625.The_Boat_Who_Wouldn_t_Float"]}
