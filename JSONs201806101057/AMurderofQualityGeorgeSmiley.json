But that does not prevent A Murder of Quality (1962) from being a well-written, entertaining book.In an introduction to a paperback edition issued almost thirty years after its original publication, le Carre wrote that \u201crereading the book now, I find a flawed thriller redeemed by ferocious and quite funny social comment.\u201d I think that is an accurate assessment. Some of the social comment targets the non-conformist Christian communities of the laboring class, but the most ferocious\u2014and most amusing\u2014satire is reserved for the upper-class English boarding school, which the author pillories for its cruelty, its insularity, and its snobbishness. Le Carre knows whereof he speaks, for he attended Sherborne in Dorset (which he loathed) and taught briefly at Eton (which he regarded with ambivalent respect).The mystery\u2014the murder of a young master's wife who is on record stating that her husband is trying to kill her\u2014has enough thrills to keep the pages turning, but the real charm of the book is in its treatment of upperclass English education. But I was surprised and also pleased to find the atmosphere enriched by a very gothic character: a crazy woman named Jane who lives in an abandoned medieval church.A Murder of Quality although an enjoyable book is nothing special. But it was the calm before the storm: le Carre's next book would be The Spy that Came in from the Cold."}, {"userName": "Jaline", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7234171-jaline", "userReview": "A dog that had not bitten the postman; a devil that rode upon the wind; a woman who knew that she would die; a little, worried man in an overcoat standing in the snow outside his hotel, and the laborious chime of the Abbey clock telling him to go to bed.\nIn this second book in the George Smiley series, Miss Brimley calls him because she is concerned about a letter she received for the small publication, The Christian Voice where a woman named Stella (Glaston) Rode writes that she fears her husband is going to kill her. Ailsa Brimley used to work with George Smiley years before and she wanted him to check into this before going to the police. One phone call and George discovers that the murder has already been committed. Even though it takes place in Carne, where his ex-wife grew up and where her family still live, he feels compelled to go and is urged to do so by Ailsa Brimley.Thus begins A Murder of Quality and the story grips you and carries you along through to the end. It is centered on a boy\u2019s school and brings with it many different characters, plus spouses, plus boys in the school, plus extras. John Le Carr\u00e9 is truly a master of his craft. As I mentioned, this is his second book and it was published in 1962. This novel is so polished, professional, and gripping, it kept me up until the wee hours to find out not only who committed the crime, but why. And the author delivers. When I say professional, I don\u2019t mean it is stuffy or formulaic in any way. It means instead that the pacing is perfect, the story is absorbing, and the quality of the writing is exceptional. It\u2019s very hard to believe that his first book had only been written the year before. My respect has expanded accordingly.It is a pleasure to recommend this book, and I am delighted that I still have 7 more in this series to look forward to!"}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "I haven't exactly rushed to read John le Carr\u00e9's books, but whenever I've gotten around to it, I'm always glad I did!The man can write. He's not the best. It's not all perfect, but it's damn good. The words just flow. The plots are solid. The characters feel like real people, which is sometimes a knock on mystery/crime writers. Carr\u00e9 spends more time rounding out his characters than your typical who-dun-it writer. Sometimes that means the action slows down and the intensity slackens, but that's all right. A change of pace is good!A Murder of Quality goes old school. Literally, this is about the students, professors and institution of an exclusive boy's prep school. Think Eton. Tradition and having \"the right stuff\" are of paramount importance. The school has standards to maintain and by god they WILL be maintained!Does that mean certain individuals, who are just too individual, need to be permanently removed like a blot might be scrubbed away? Former intelligence officer George Smiley is discreetly on the scene to discover what he can. Smiley is a central figure in many of Carr\u00e9's books. He's a likable old chap. Sensible, smart and crafty, and rather unassuming. No, not at all pompous. You root for him to take it out of the windbag or bring the snooty character down a peg. Without being overtly charming or particularly outstanding in any way, it's amazing how easily you suddenly find yourself rooting for Smiley. This low-key character blends into the background of this equally low-key book, and yet you still pull for him from the edge of your seat by the end. A Murder of Quality is another book of quality by Carr\u00e9!"}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6022914-james", "userReview": "All this time I had been clear in my mind that George Smiley was a spy master and that John le Carr\u00e9 writes spy novels. \nA Murder of Quality\n, the second novel in the George Smiley series, blew both of those assumptions away completely. While you could argue that Smiley is technically a spy, he's retired from the service. When his friend and former colleague from their days in the intelligence services, Ailsa Brimley, receives a paranoid letter from a subscriber to her magazine, The Christian Voice, the wife of a schoolteacher claiming that her husband intends to kill her. Brim is determined to make sure she investigates the claim from such a loyal subscriber and so she goes to the only man she knows who can advise her: George Smiley.There are no spies here, no moles, no cold war, no double-cross at Checkpoint Charlie. This is a straight up murder mystery, but one that sets up Smiley's understated detecting capabilities perfectly: a murder committed exactly as in the letter but the husband has a solid alibi. Luckily, Smiley has a tenuous connection with a colleague of the husband and sees an opportunity to take advantage of the rules of politeness and invite himself down to the school to have a poke around. Before long Smiley and the local detective are secretly working the case together: Detective Inspector Rigby the official side of the investigation and Smiley the eyes and ears in the school itself \u2013 asking the questions in a way that the police never could.Of course Smiley's going to solve the case, that's never in doubt. And, while the story is your typical murder mystery, le Carr\u00e9 never really plays into that trope of letting the reader play along and pit themselves against the detective. Instead he seems to want you to just sit in for the ride, watching Smiley's methods, learning how he operates. To some extent it feels like a primer for the Smiley we can expect in the rest of the novels, but that also felt like the skill of the novel. At no point did I really want to compete with Smiley, I was enjoying the novel too damn much..."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75157-carol", "userReview": "My husband is quite a fan of John LeCarre and convinced me that I should read this one. It is a small novel (146 pages) compared to his later books of 300 or more pages and a little mystery instead of a cold war spy novel. Not being the greatest fan of a mystery novel (I tend to read them too fast, or peek at the ending - because I can't stand the suspense -- or I'm up until the wee hours of the morning because I can't go to sleep until I find out \"who did it\"), I was surprised how much I enjoyed this one, managed to read it slowly and thoroughly enjoyed the author's writing. I think I enjoyed LeCarre's writing even more than the mystery.Example: \"Smiley himself was one of those solitaries who seem to have come into the world fully educated at the age of eighteen. Obscurity was his nature, as well as his profession. The byways of espionage are not populated by the brash and colourful adventurers of fiction. A man who, like Smiley has lived and worked for years among his country's enemies learns only one prayer: that he may never, never be noticed. Assimilation is his highest aim. He learns to love the crowds who pass him in the street without a glance; he clings to them for his anonymity and his safety. His fear makes him servile --- he could embrace the shoppers who jostle him in their impatience, and force him from the pavement. He could adore the officials, the police, the bus conductors, for the terse indifference of their attitudes.\"But this fear, this servility, this dependence, had developed in Smiley a perception for the coulour of human beings; a swift, feminine sensitivity to their characters and motives. He knew mankind as a huntsman knows his cover, as a fox the wood. For a spy must hunt while he is hunted, and the crowd is his estate. He could collect their gestures and their words, record the interplay of glance and movement, as a huntsman can record the twisted bracken and the broken twig, or as a fox detects the signs of danger.\"I may have to read another LeCarre novel."}, {"userName": "Bettie\u262f", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie", "userReview": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011cfjwDescription: A public school in the early 1960s.

Moreover, he makes it look easy. Unless you stop and pay attention, it just seems like ordinary, good writing. But in reality, he has a gift.It was a peculiarity of Smiley's character that throughout the whole of his clandestine work he had never managed to reconcile the means to the end. A stringent critic of his own motives, he had discovered after long observation that he tended to be less a creature of intellect than his tastes and habits might suggest; once in the war he had been described by his superiors as possessing the cunning of Satan and the conscience of a virgin, which seemed to him not wholly unjust.It's hard to find a more lovable genre character than Smiley. You want him as a stuffed animal, to cuddle in bed with on rainy fall mornings.Rather than an espionage novel, this is a straight murder mystery, with Smiley acting as citizen-detective as a favor to a friend. It's a bit convoluted, and there are character twists which may or may not make sense. It's also a superb snapshot of brutal attitudes about class, and worth reading for that alone."}, {"userName": "Zoeytron", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12656534-zoeytron", "userReview": "Reading John Le Carre's writing is like treating yourself to a fine wine. It is not to be sped through or swigged. His words and passages lend themselves to being slowly consumed and savored. A Murder of Quality was set in present day when it was published over 50 years ago. Thus the sound of a milk truck chugging from house to house in the early morning hours with the milkman making his front porch deliveries is not out of place. Elevator lifts still boast a uniformed elevator operator, \"What floor, please?\" As an aside, the price printed on the cover of my copy of this paperback book is fifty cents. George Smiley, ex-British Secret Intelligence agent, is asked by a longtime friend to look into a matter which turns into a murder most foul. In this particular tale, there is no espionage, no spies, nary a mole to be ferreted out. It is a simple murder mystery, told by the master."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan", "userReview": "This is the second novel featuring George Smiley; the first is, \"Call for the Dead\". This is unlike most of the Smiley books, in that it is really a classic crime story, much in the style of an Agatha Christie. Set in an exclusive boarding school, Carne School in Dorset, this is obviously something which the author feels strongly about, considering that he spent much of his life from the age of five (so young!) in such institutions, as well as teaching at Eton.In this book, Smiley is contacted by Miss Ailsa Brimley, who he knew from the war. She works at a small magazine, the Christian Voice, which has a loyal and long standing readership. One of the readers, who has subscribed since the beginning, is Stella Rode - now a wife of one of the masters at Carne. When she contacts the letters page to say she fears her husband is trying to kill her, Miss Brimley takes it seriously and turns to Smiley. However, when he investigates, he finds that Mrs Rode was killed the previous evening, in a vicious attack at her home.This is an unusual novel in the Smiley series, but well worth reading if you enjoy crime and mystery books and also offers insights into the character of George Smiley - as the area where the story is set is the one in which his wife, Ann, grew up. It also has an interesting setting and Miss Brimley is an excellent character, as are the snobbish and tradition bound masters at the school. If you wish to read on, the next book is the classic, \"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\".I listened to this on Audible and it is wonderfully read by Michael Jayston; whose voice is just perfect for Smiley."}, {"userName": "Tiffany Reisz", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4612196-tiffany-reisz", "userReview": "A good little murder mystery that kept me guessing until the end"}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3301814-james", "userReview": "Started off brilliantly but ended with a whimper, as the ending felt contrived and unrealistic. I think as the author himself put it not bad as a social satire but weak as a thriller. The story starts when a colleague of Smiley contacts him to help with a letter she has received from a reader of the magazine she edits. As Smiley gets more involved all the great ingredients you find in le carre`s book are there - great characters minutely observed, a taste for the depressing england of the post war period, and finally an intricate problem that Smiley progressively gets closer to solving. Also the environment of the public school captured wonderfully (based on the authors time at Eton as a teacher). What just wrecked the whole thing for me is that the actions of the victim in the book were completely inconsistent, with the first 100 or so pages presenting one type of person and in the last 40 pages presenting the complete opposite. I suspect I am too thick to get it and maybe the different depiction was yet another reflection of the snobby hideous characters. Who knows, I would it give it a miss."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura", "userReview": "From BBC Radio 4 Extra:A public school in the early 1960s.

I suspect it is also something of a footnote when compared with the more famous and celebrated books that came in its wake. However, 'A Murder of Quality' is still well worth reading. Beautifully written and expertly plotted, it also takes a razor sharp scalpel to snobbery and the British class system, and has a pleasingly authentic and complex psychological dimension. As with 'Call for the Dead', the first George Smiley novel, part of what is so marvellous about this book is how John le Carr\u00e9 allows the reader to enter Smiley\u2019s mind and the slow, deliberate machinations as he grapples with complex problems.

The unassuming and easily forgettable Smiley takes us along with him on his journey to discover the murderer and it is this journey that makes this book so special.The murder occurs at Carne, an elite English boarding school for boys. The wife of one of the Master teachers is viciously killed.Along the way to discovering the murderer, we become immersed in the English educational/church society studying contrasts between the haves and have nots. We learn the sometimes sad truths behind the illusions of wealth and power: faded dreams, compromises made, and less than desirable alliances formed to maintain the status quo.Le Carr\u00e9's characters are colorful, well-developed, and believable. The dialogue is sophisticated and subtle, with a clever but gentle cynical eye toward long established institutions. His books, this one no exception, deal with important social issues. They are presented so naturally and eloquently through the characters' interactions and through Smiley's observations, it's almost as if this knowledge is absorbed by magic. Of course it is le Carr\u00e9's writing talent, artistic ability, and his keen wit that makes the magic happen.It is a sad book. Smiley doesn't take murder or those involved in it lightly. He understands complexities and is a thoughtful man. Le Carre makes him so.Every time I read a novel by LeCarr\u00e9 I feel a little confused and a bit overwhelmed at first. But I have learned to slow down relax and enjoy each wonderful tale. It is worth the extra effort and slower pace to be so richly rewarded."}, {"userName": "Jaksen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7233842-jaksen", "userReview": "What a book...And despite a lot of low reviews, this book really says a lot about British 'culture' when it comes to the public school, a place where boys (or girls) are introduced to their place in society. Really, that's how this book reads and le Carre is not a big fan of it. The condescension of the 'betters' to the 'lower classes' just reeks through every page, and the descriptions of personalities who exist only when there's an audience, wow, is so current to what's happening in today's world. Written in the early 60's, so much of the societal factors and the reasons people do what they do - it rings as clearly as if it were written in 2017.A woman writes to the editor of a small Christian newspaper, indicating her life is in danger and she fears her husband. The editor passes the information to Smiley, but too late, the woman has already been murdered. Mr. George Smiley goes to investigate. The dead woman was married to a teacher at 'Carne,' a public (private, elite, upper-class) boy's school, but she didn't quite fit in, was sort of a maverick who ignored the societal rules and manners she was expected to uphold. But why was she killed?This is the kind of book where, at the end, I thought, omg the writer gave us SO MANY CLUES as to why she was killed, so what am I, blind? Yeah, I was. The book has a great many twists and turns, and what you expect to be so - well, it just ain't necessarily so. So there.I don't understand the low reviews. There are portions of the book which describe personalities we all know from the news - politics, entertainment, the media, etc. - which have always been with us, but who often fool us with their exterior selves. He mentions many times that we never really know anyone, that the nicest folks can conceal the worst parts of themselves. In that manner the book isn't merely a mystery with a former spy as the central protagonist/investigator, it's a deeply nuanced psychological study as well.It's one of those books I want to re-read. I don't find too many of those."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-chris", "userReview": "George Smilely solves a murder.

In this book George Smiley who is retired from the British Secret Service, is called by an old friend, Ailsa Brimley of a small newspaper to investigate a troubling letter she received from a worried reader.

Smiley immerses himself with the professors and locals and listens and learns about them and the community. As he uncovers their secrets and hatreds, he solves the mystery. Smiley is such a likable, smart and unassuming character. It\u2019s a lot of fun to read this series.

At the end of it all, I think I enjoyed the book a lot more than my husband did\u2026but it's still something of a disappointment.Like Le Carr\u00e9's first book, A Murder of Quality has the same problems for me as a) a book placed in time before my birth and b) a book set in England\u2014and in the English boarding school system, at that\u2014putting it outside of my common cultural context. I do think that most of it is reasonably clear from context, but it does require a little mental translation. Less enjoyable is the casual sexism/misogyny that permeates the book. Though I think that Le Carr\u00e9 often has both an incisive and pitiless eye when it comes to people in general, there's definitely a greater sense of compassion and empathy when it comes to his male characters than his female ones. And, aside from the characters who clearly have no good use for women, there's enough inferential condemnation and failure to present any of the female characters in the same sympathetic light of all the male characters that it can only be authorial, especially since Call for the Dead had the exact same issues with women and a wholesale condemnation of marriage.Sadly, to some extent, I feel like this is the price of admission to a book written in the 60's, and, even more so, for a Le Carr\u00e9 novel. So, putting that aside\u2026It took 22 pages for me to really get into the book. This is definitely different from Call for the Dead and, I assume, the other Smiley books in that it isn't really a spy novel or a thriller at all; it's a rather straightforward English mystery. Mysteries basically go one of two ways; either the author lays clues like breadcrumbs throughout the narrative, giving the reader a chance to put the pieces together ahead of the big reveal at the end, or authors withhold key information, making it impossible for the reader to put the pieces together themselves. I feel like A Murder of Quality tries to have it both ways. That is, there are definitely clues dropped all the way along, some of them more obvious than others, Le Carr\u00e9 also withholds strategic pieces. For me, this meant that, although I had a reasonable idea of who the end killer would turn out to be, I couldn't pin down means or motive or even if I was right about the killer until the big confession scene at the end. For the most part, the journey itself was enjoyable. Academia seems to be much the same, regardless of country. I liked how Le Carr\u00e9 pit characters' opposing viewpoints and unreliable narration against each other to disguise important information. As I said before, I think Le Carr\u00e9 has the same eye he ascribes to Smiley in understanding people, even at their worst, and I think it's his greatest talent as a writer. Unfortunately, it's not quite a powerful enough talent to make this lackluster mystery work.Personally, I don't enjoy mysteries where the author withholds the important information in an attempt to stay ahead of his reader. It feels like cheating; an author who doesn't trust his skills of camouflage to either a) keep his reader guessing or, if not b) make the journey enjoyable enough that the reader doesn't care that they figured it all out ahead of time. The fact that Le Carr\u00e9 does dispense certain clues while holding back on others, connecting the pieces only at the end gave me exactly that feeling of a rigged game where only the House can win. Moreover, the fact that all the pieces are only connected in the last dozen or so pages of the book, after the excessively slow wind-up, makes the ending feel sloppy and rushed; P.T. Barnum rushing his circus attendees out the egress before they can see the wires and trap doors and costume zippers. In one sense, it's hard for me to dissect how much A Murder of Quality suffers for age; as a kid and teen, I read any number of 'old' mysteries in this same secretive vein\u2014hell, all the Sherlock Holmes mysteries are a variation on this theme\u2014and there are still current authors who write this way. It's a legitimate means, even if I don't like it personally. But I don't think any amount of forgiveness for the story's age can make up for the rushed and inadequately resolved ending. This is still one of his early books, though. Hopefully, Le Carr\u00e9 will improve on both his faults and his strengths as he goes on."}, {"userName": "Neil", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33119635-neil", "userReview": "I have started a small project to read my way through all the George Smiley novels. There are 9 of them including the one released just this year (2017) that I will get to eventually. Many of the earlier ones I read at or around the time they were released, but, for most of them, that is several decades ago and my memories are fuzzy, to say the least. In fact, if I am honest, I can't remember if this one is one I read or whether this was my first reading of it! With memories that vague, I think I should consider it my first reading even if it actually isn't.We think of George Smiley as a spy and of the novels he is in as spy novels. The first in the series (Call for the Dead) does have spies in it, but it is not a spy novel. It is a detective novel set in an espionage environment. This second novel does away with the spies and is a pure detective novel. This is because the first in the series saw Smiley leave the service for \"retirement\" so he is now a gentleman of leisure free to assist a friend who receives are mysterious letter.The mysterious letter is from a woman who believes her husband is planning to kill her. Then she is murdered. Needless to say, it is not simple to find out whether it was her husband who did it and Smiley's work to uncover the killer and their motive is what the book is about. As I say, it's a detective novel.In fact, reading this in 2017, when there is a plethora of detective stories on the television, it is hard not to think that you are actually reading Morse or Lewis or Shetland or .... My wife loves these TV programmes (and reads all the books, too), and this novel sits alongside them as a short but well-told murder mystery that gradually uncovers people's dark, hidden secrets. There are never any happy people in a detective novel!It is a very quick read - just 147 pages. But it gives us a clearer idea of who Smiley is, fills in some background about his failed marriage and is fun to read. Next up is The Spy Who Came In from the Cold which is the novel that shot Le Carre to international fame (and really is a spy novel, albeit one in which Smiley has a very insignificant part)."}, {"userName": "Travis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1609738-travis", "userReview": "I just checked this out from the library for some light reading during a trip, thinking it was the only Le Carre I hadn't read--only to discover a few pages into it that I had read it after all. So, I read it again.I'm a real fan of Le Carre's spy novels (especially \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy,..\" and \"The Night Manager,\" most of which handily transcend the genre and wrestle with deeper issues in much more sophisticated ways than do the works of any other writer of spy fiction save Graham Greene. To read a Le Carre is akin to engaging in an all-night conversation with a learned colleague of subtle wit and rare insight into the human condition and its body politic. The conversation proceeds slowly and sometimes leaves you leaning forward in your chair wishihg you had listened with greater attention. But it almost always rewards you with a richer (though usually less optimistic) understanding of life than you had when you began.This book (e Carre's second novel), along with \"Call for the Dead\" (his first), are less vintage Le Carre than mature Agatha Christie--they introduce characters that will inhabit future Le Carre works, and they benefit from the same merciless scrutiny of British social mores and ills as do his spy novels, but otherwise they are both solid mystery tales, witty and fun to unravel. This one is about the dark underbelly of an elite boarding school, investigated with as much attention to detail as the gruesome death of a teacher's non-conformist wife.If you're interested in Le Carre (and you should be, if the current world politics at all trouble your sleep), then this is a good place to start, not at all as ponderous and dense as his later work, but just as engaging."}, {"userName": "Bam", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5922426-bam", "userReview": "The second book in the George Smiley series is another intriguing mystery.

His preliminary check into the matter finds the woman has already been brutally murdered.

Luckily, he concerns himself with many of the same themes, as evidenced by this quote about Smiley: \"Making his way through the Carne streets, he reflected for the hundredth time on the obscurity of motive in human action: there is no true thing on earth. There is no constant, no dependable point, not even in the purest logic or the most obscure mysticism; least of all in the motives of men when they are moved to act violently.\" There was an unpredictable twist, and a neat and tidy ending, both worthy of more famous \"mystery\" novelists.

However, as opposed to the first novel, which was a fusion of noir and espionage featuring Smiley as a de facto 'detective' in the mode of Marlowe or Spade, this is much more along the lines of the old-school 'whodunnit', and while Le Carre deconstructs the conventions of the genre, how much mileage one ultimately gets from this book depends upon their appreciation for that type of mystery."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26734926-emma", "userReview": "I absolutely adored this short murder mystery by John le Carre.

She was working class, had simple tastes and was famously disliked by the other faculty members and their wives.

Not those with fancy gadgets but those who work in the dark, not drawing attention to themselves, carefully collecting intel and coding their messages.

This book is about a murder, no espionage.Smiley having quit his job after getting fed up with his idiot boss a book ago is asked by a friend to investigate a murder. I like that Smiley is not your average dashing hero, he's fat, he wears large glasses and looks like a fool.
