In Killer Insight, Abby Cooper, professional psychic, finds herself flying to a friends wedding to fill in for a newly missing bridesmaid after breaking up with her boyfriend, FBI agent Dutch Rivers. It doesn't take long for Abby's crew to start singing, and Abby soon realizes that the bridesmaid she's filling in for isn't missing, she's dead. She pairs up with the bride-to-be's older brother (who she may or may not have a one night stand with...I'm not telling!) to solve the murders. In the process she paints a very large bulls-eye on her back.For any of you who have read some of my earlier reviews on previous books in this series, you'll be aware of the fact that I'm not exactly in love with Dutch. In fact, he's not my cup of tea at all. Most of the time I'm urging Abby to break up with him in my head. So, it surprised me when I almost cried when they broke up at the beginning of the book. (I say almost as I was on the bus and put the book away quickly before I embarrassed myself). This goes to prove just how good of a write Laurie is.She made that scene so realistic for me. Nothing in it seemed outlandish, or even made me roll my eyes. It was perfectly written. Good enough to get someone who didn't even think the two of them belonged together to shed a tear over the thought of them losing each other.That was just one of the examples of her great writing skills that were in this book. I believe it to be one of the better in the series thus far (and I'm looking forward to reading more!)My recommendations: If you haven't read any of the Abby Cooper books, start with the first one and don't stop! If you have read all of them up until now, and wondering if you should continue...what are you thinking? Pick up the next one and get reading!!"}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31036585-jill", "userReview": "That didn't end at all how I was expecting.

She hasn't gotten a call from him in days, and she believes he doesn't want her anymore. But when she goes to Colorado for a friend's wedding things start to get really complicated for her. People start dying who know her friend, and she ends up around her childhood crush a lot. Add into the fact that another killer is on the loose, and Abby is making some crazy choices in this one as well. But it was nice to see her respected by the police at least somewhat in this one. The only thing that annoyed me was what Abby with her crush, I wish she hadn't made that mistake. But other than that I thought the story was really interesting, and I enjoyed it a lot.

And that\u2019s exactly what the Abby Cooper: Psychic Eye mystery series is. Never deep, complicated, or overwhelmingly reeling, I found the first three books in the series to be fun and easy. I took them at face value and didn\u2019t judge harshly. After all, they entertained me.I ignored Abby\u2019s annoying behavior (e.g. a woman never tells a man that she sat by the phone all week waiting for him to call \u2013 unless she\u2019s a Victoria Laurie heroine named Abby Cooper). A woman also never makes a scene in public over tedious mishaps on her boyfriend\u2019s part \u2013 another one of Abby\u2019s favorite pastimes. Nevertheless, I got over it, also ignoring the unrealistic characters, such as Abby\u2019s richer-than-Bill-Gates sister, Cat, who always seems to show up for\u2026 absolutely no reason at all. I\u2019ve seen Abby\u2019s sister described as \u201ca beloved character\u201d on other reader reviews. Personally, I sigh in exasperation any time she she\u2019s even mentioned, and pray to the heavens that Laurie doesn\u2019t find some humdrum reason for Cat to make an appearance. Which happens in every single book. Even though she lives a plane ride away.Then there\u2019s Abby\u2019s boyfriend, Dutch, an FBI agent whose personality changes from book to book. He\u2019s either depicted as the perfect boyfriend, and also the most easygoing boyfriend to put up with Abby\u2019s erratic behavior, or, come the next book in the series, the most thoughtless ass Laurie could dream up. Mostly, however, I\u2019ve always ignored (which is VERY hard for me to do) the run-on sentences, comma splices, occasional missing period, and other numerous grammatical errors.Then comes Killer Insight, the fourth book in the series. Like I said, I take these books for the mindless fluff that I figure they\u2019re supposed to be and focus on the fact that they entertain me. Killer Insight, however, is slow, boring, predictable, and, quite frankly, almost painful. Without entertainment, the annoying characters, weak writing, and lack of depth make each page excruciatingly agonizing to get through. Even making it from one sentence to the next seems like a hardship that no reader should have to bear. The plot: After a fight with Dutch (he's inconsiderate and completely oblivious to it this time around), Abby finds herself bolting to Colorado to be a bridesmaid in an old friend's wedding. But things take a nasty turn when the other bridesmaids start disappearing and all evidence turns to the groom. Seems like a good enough premise for some light chick lit, right? Well, it's a shame what could have been.The first three books are exciting, fast-paced thrillers, all worth reading if you enjoy a guilty pleasure now and then. But Killer Insight falls flat. If you\u2019re a fan of the series, read the fourth installment at your own risk. But don\u2019t feel bad if you have to put the book aside and skip on to the next. You won\u2019t miss a thing.

Although it can be a stand alone book, I really like the way I'm getting to know the characters as the series progresses.In Killer Insight, Abby, a professional psychic who sometimes helps the police with cases, and her FBI agent boyfriend, Dutch, have had a less than romantic Valentine's Day dinner, culminating in Abby realizing the relationship is over and asking Dutch to please leave. Heartbroken, she reluctantly agrees to fly to Denver to be a bridesmaid for her friend Ellie, thinking the change of scenery will do her some good. The scenery is definitely an improvement when she sees her friend's hunky policeman brother Duffy! Unfortunately she also intuitively learns that one of the bridesmaids is dead. Not wanting to upset Ellie, she voices her concern to Duffy, and the two of them try to solve the mystery of the missing bridesmaid. A serial rapist/murderer is also in the area, and some of the clues are pointing at Ellie's fianc\u00e9. As the bridesmaids start dropping like flies, Abby's change of scenery may be a permanent one unless they can catch the killer. I loved this one just as I did the others because I really got caught up in the characters and the storyline. Just when I thought I had the mystery figured out and was waiting for the denouement, there would be another interesting plot twist! I also really like the way Abby uses her gift and how she worries about the ethics of whether or not to tell her friend the messages she is receiving. The little bit of romance to help Abby's bruised heart was nice, too! A great, engrossing read!"}, {"userName": "Sharon ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2605384-sharon", "userReview": "Bumping up to 3 stars....Parts of this book I liked, the other parts were just meh....Abby finds herself running away from a relationship (meh #1) to be a bridesmaid in her best friend's wedding. Her heart really isn't to it, but she goes because they are very close....yet she knows none of the other bridesmaids (meh #2), Her pyschic intuition is off and she's not quite to her intuitive self (meh #3) and finds herself in a heap load of dead bridesmaids. Like I said, I did enjoy certain parts. I understand that these books are very light reading and I do/have looked over certain things. But the mehs just keep bugging me.Meh #1 - As much a I like Dutch, I don't like how he doesn't embrace Abby's gift of sight as openly as she would like,but I think her blaming their \"break up\" on him was a no no. It was most def Abby that did all the breaking as Dutch just wanted some breathing room to focus on his new job with the FBI. He adores her and she didn't give the caveman his chance to try to take his foot out of his mouth.Meh #2- Abby had never even heard of any of these women. I just have a hard time with that. If you're besties with someone, you must have some inclination of who her friend is spending her time with. Plus the fact that she's basically a fill in for a missing bridesmaid just irritated me. (Granted that Abby does live 1200 miles away)Meh #3- I don't really like how Abby just gives people readings all willy nilly-like. Some people aren't prepared for that kind of shock and she's often blurting things out. But in this case she was just \"off\"?? I just don't buy it. Espcially since she was off on numerous occasions."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22522957-amy", "userReview": "Should you read this book? Answer: Have you been reading the series? If Yes, then you probably should to keep up with the story-line. If No, then I would pass.Here's why:This novel is not Victoria Laurie's best. While the book ends with a bang, it takes forever to get there. The last 50 pages are the best of the whole book, by far. The beginning of the book drags as Abby deals with personal issues about her relationship with Dutch and her burgeoning relationship with Duffy. The conflict between Dutch feels contrived and Abby's flight from Michigan (while remaining true to character) seem like an easy way to deal with the interpersonal relationship between Dutch and Abby which wraps up in a nice package at the end of the book.Victoria Laurie never really deals with what went on between her Abby and Dutch. For a book series that seems so extraordinary, Victoria Laurie always, previously, had her characters seem so real, the way she dealt with them in this book seems to take after a romantic comedy.The over-arching mystery in this novel takes a back-seat to the aforementioned romance triangle. This is sad, as the mystery could have been taken a lot further than it was. It wasn't gripping as the previous books in the series were. This book was much easier to put down than Victoria Laurie's previous books. The twist does redeem this book, that is if you can get through the beginning.Don't feel disheartened by this novel in the Psychic Eye series, overall it is a brilliantly written series that balances both wit and intriguing mysteries.

I'm reading these books for some light fun. That being the case, I try very hard to ignore inconsistencies and things that make me go \"what the hell?\". Still, a few things... Abby is supposedly close friends with the bride, but (ignoring the fact that we never heard about the girl in the previous books [which is fine to me, I suppose the author can't plan out everything]) it feels like they're great childhood friends. It doesn't seem as if Abby knows much about her friends current life, which causes a bit of a disconnect. The way she broke up with Dutch was seriously lame, and this was the part of the book I winced over every time I read it. I'm not thrilled with their relationship, but breaking up with him so quickly and easily... On one hand I think Abby relies too much on her psychic powers, but I usually think she doesn't rely on them enough (or doesn't listen to them enough). I also dislike the way the author constructs the book, so that there's a shot of the present, and then the book rewinds and Abby tells the story up to then. I hated the way the author sometimes interjects Abby going \"If I knew I would regret this...\" so on and so forth in her previous books, but in this one, it was even worse. The end was... meh. I actually liked the plot of the book until the end. The way Abby resolves her relationship with Duffy is really convenient. As is the way she resolves her relationship with Dutch.
