I debated asking her if she accepted tips and decided against it.\nThis was such an enjoyable reading experience. I laughed, I remembered, I nodded along with some of the author's experiences and cringed at others. I suppose this is like the evil (and totally honest) twin to What to Expect When You're Expecting.O'Connell doesn't waste time with the bullshit. I have no idea if this book will have the same effect on those who haven't had a baby, or men, but it was so great to read a book that gets in to all the funny miserable gory details of pregnancy and early motherhood. The author's style is frank, witty and engaging as she navigates through the self-doubt and insecurities while pregnant, the birth and recovery period, and trying to hold her relationship together whilst breastfeeding and depressed.There's so many books painting birth and motherhood as a beautiful, uplifting experience. So many mommy bloggers on Pinterest bossing life with their mason jar salads, labelled containers of everything from flour to quinoa to chia seed (seriously, wtf?), and their freezers full of expressed breast milk. I don't know about you, but this is not my reality.And Now We Have Everything definitely makes you want to share your own experiences. I totally get feeling like you'll never be good enough. I get waking up obsessively and squinting at your baby to see if he's still breathing, convinced that he isn't. I get spending months feeling like a lactating pair of breasts and not a human being. Breasts have been sexualized in the society I live in, but there's no cure for this sexualization quite like the pain and messiness of breastfeeding. I am so over breasts.And, hell, there is so much pressure! Especially in the U.S. (or California, at least). Growing up, many of the women I knew formula-fed their babies. My siblings and I were all formula-fed. This is mostly because our mothers couldn't afford to not go back to work and milking humans with a machine wasn't a thing. But for me, in Southern California, nobody asked me what I wanted to do. It was just accepted that I would breastfeed unless - gasp - I was unable to. When my second baby had trouble latching in the first few days, we had to supplement with formula, and the nurse looked at me gravely and assured me \"Please don't worry, you will still be able to breastfeed\" and all I was actually worried about was that my baby got some food.\nBreastfeeding was not the most incredible experience of my life, and my baby is still mortal. He still gets sick. I went to great lengths to do it, for reasons I can no longer relate to. Or none other than this: I so desperately wanted to do the right thing, and I had no idea what that was yet.\nI love that O'Connell dispels myths surrounding childbirth. She paints it not as a beautiful, miraculous experience, but as a painful, gory, unglamorous one. As she notes at one point, people seem reluctant to be honest with women about what an unpleasant experience it can be - as if they're afraid the human race will die out or something - urging them to \"embrace the pain and make it part of themselves\" or some other crap. Yeah, maybe that works for some women, but there are many who feel like failures when it doesn't.Most of all I just love how this book forgives us-- for being unable to breastfeed, for saying \"f--- you\" to a natural birth, for crying despairingly while listening to Alison Krauss sing Baby Mine (shut up), for spending a year looking like shit, for being crazy, for not being perfect.

But I'm trying to decide if I want to, and reading this memoir allowed me to feel like I was sitting inside a close friend's mind while she experienced everything for me. (Convenient! Except the body horror.)The writing is inviting, especially for a child of the internet like me: at turns bitingly sarcastic, deeply self-reflective, and breathtakingly vulnerable. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in what it's like to suddenly create a whole person out of tiny cells...and really, it's a valuable primer on being a woman, generally.

Well, it\u2019s actually for a couple reasons, one that has to do with all women and one more for O\u2019Connell.As a woman with now adult children, I can say for all of us that NO ONE is ever really ready for motherhood. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the more ready a woman thinks she is, probably the less ready she actually is. I think it might be a little like war. You can read all about it, and you might even get trained to go to war, but until you\u2019ve actually been there, you just can\u2019t know. Motherhood is an on-the-fly job. You figure it out as you go. As I said, my kids are adults and I\u2019m still figuring it out!Meaghan O\u2019Connell might have been slightly less ready than the average women, but not for lack of trying. O\u2019Connell had already known that she wanted a baby, so when she turned up pregnant at 29, the decision for her and her fianc\u00e9e, Dustin, to have the baby was a relatively easy one. From the onset, O\u2019Connell was a slave to information, to answers to the unanswerable questions of how things would go for her, before, during and after the birth of her son. She was a Google maniac constantly trying to calm her many, many fears. For me her anxiety bordered on the neurotic and her experiences, while large to her, were not really all that different from many other women\u2019s. O\u2019Connell implies that she wasn\u2019t ready for motherhood because of the timing and where she was in life, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019d have been any more ready at 40. Her journey was her journey to take.O\u2019Connell\u2019s writing in And Now We Have Everything was sharp, funny and wonderfully easy to read, though I grew weary of her unrelenting angst. I\u2019m sure younger woman will appreciate the book more than I did. Still, I\u2019d like to issue a warning to readers who might be considering having a first baby: And Now We Have Everything tells the events surrounding one woman\u2019s journey into motherhood. Yours will be your own, and likely much different. Please, read with that in mind.

It took 10 months before I stopped getting flashbacks and shaking every time something reminded me of childbirth. After almost two years, I still have not physically recovered fully although the PT says this is as good as it gets and this reduced state of health and wellness counts as \"healed\". And I got off easy compared to many. There is no other routine lifecycle event that we pressure people into undergoing that is anything like childbirth.If you look around for the acknowledgement of what childbirth is really like for women in our society, it\u2019s hidden under a cheerful, polished veneer of \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Books like the Girlfriend\u2019s Guide titter cheerfully that bikini season is permanently over and yes you will pee every time you sneeze for the rest of your life, but *it\u2019s all worth it!* Nobody warns you of the other possible side-effects or long-term ramifications, even though the list is longer than any that you will hear at the end of a pharmaceuticals advertisement. Nobody can really prepare you for what it\u2019s like, but neither does anyone really try. \u201cIt\u2019s all worth it.\u201d One is not allowed to be grumpy or bitter about having a baby, because there are so many who would love the opportunity. It\u2019s in poor taste, so much of a First World Problem that even the first world has no sympathy. And so, nobody says anything.Until now. Meaghan O\u2019Connell\u2019s \u201cAnd Now We Have Everything\u201d is the scream of rage every woman should read before they move on to the frothy cheer of Hypnobabies, The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, and the rest of the misleading canon of motherhood that we feed women to convince them that it\u2019s all No Big Deal and if they think it is, the problem is with them.It's a personal memoir, so I didn\u2019t identify with everything, but the overall experience and sentiment rang true. My \u201cPTSD\u201d returned while I read. I shook. I cried. I wanted to shout \"Yes!\" and \"Exactly!\" and \"You said it!\" at various points where she perfectly captures the post-partum struggle of existing as a human being. I wanted to call Meaghan up and start a mommy group where we can all sit around complain about how shitty it all is, and mock the people who would have us believe there\u2019s a comparison between human and feline childbirth, or that \u201cnever sleeping again\u201d is a perfectly normal way to exist, or that living with chronic pain is desirable when it's in service of a baby.Of course, if you're one of those people with no expectations of a life beyond motherhood, or who think that \"it's all worth it\" means that a child is perfect compensation for any loss incurred in its creation, then this is not the book for you. But it's okay: you've already got a million books that are for you.

I feel incredibly ambivalent about having children of my own, and I think in some ways I took her decision and enthusiasm (which was never fully explained to my satisfaction) personally and that's not her fault.

Pregnancy, she says, confers a disorienting authority. After a lifetime of being doubted in girlhood, only as a mom-to-be do strangers and relatives ask after her well-being and wait seriously on her orders.

It was a refreshingly honest account that did not shy away from the pain, inconveniences and overwhelming experiences that are part and parcel of the journey.The memoir starts in New York when the author was a late-20s hopeful writer, and within pages we are swept up in finding out that she is unexpectedly pregnant. I really enjoyed the honesty and humanity that leapt off the page and instantly made the author\u2019s experience relatable (even to me as a non-mother). So many memoirs of motherhood exclude women who have not experienced the journey first-hand, so I particularly appreciated how inclusive this one felt.This was also a fascinating parallel to read following my recent read of Jessie Greengrass\u2019s \u2018Sight\u2019 \u2013 a literary fiction reflecting on motherhood and perceptions of one\u2019s body. Where \u2018Sight\u2019 contemplates motherhood in a very introspective manner, O\u2019Connell\u2019s memoir exposes its gritty reality, and labours the need to give women the autonomy they deserve during motherhood (rather than treating women like delicate little flowers). Later in the memoir she recalls a writer that she drew from during her own pregnancy and how she set up this utopian image of the perfect birth and it\u2019s attainability for all women. Months after giving birth to her son, O\u2019Connell is listening to this writer interviewed on a podcast and breaks down when she admits that it isn\u2019t all sunshine and roses, and that if we told women it was a painful awful experience no one would want to go through it. In many ways I feel like this memoir is the book that O\u2019Connell was looking for to guide her own experience of motherhood as she embarked upon it.What is so effective about O\u2019Connell\u2019s book is that she does share so much of this pain, and I think her experience arms and empowers other women with more realistic expectations than are sometimes proffered by social media and other books on the experience.This was a short but compelling read, and I greatly appreciated O\u2019Connell\u2019s humor and candor sharing such intimate moments.Thanks to NetGalley and Little, Brown & Company for providing a copy in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19267835-christine", "userReview": "There are certain periods in life I would not want to travel back to and one of them is early motherhood. It's amazing the difference between the perceived version (the loving mother tenderly gazing at her newborn child, the child cooing back) and the everyday, well, monotony - desperation for time alone, hating breastfeeding, feeling like a lump and no longer recognizing your own body, the crying (the baby, yourself), the constant attachment. Is it obvious by this point that I too suffered from severe post-partum depression?This is why I praise Meaghan O'Connell's brutally honest look at the everyday side of new motherhood and all of its complexities - the side so many people hide, whether intentionally or not. There is enough of the fluffy romanticized side out there; it needs to be balanced with a dose of reality. No wonder so many of us are thrown into a tailspin when our actuality doesn't match the versions we've imagined.This book nails down the fact that everyone has a unique experience - some mothers love parts that others despise, some women love pregnancy while others can't wait to get the baby out, and even though there are billions of people on earth, every birth story somehow manages to be one-of-a-kind. There is a literal tug-of-war battle that rages within a lot of new mothers - that of feeling more in love than ever yet, with equal strength on certain days, wanting to escape.I have to admit that because I personally found the first year so difficult, it was almost hard to relive some of that time via this memoir, but I appreciate the honest account. Anyone considering parenthood should read this book first - not to change your mind or to be scared off or to lose the fantasy altogether, but to get a glimpse of the real parts that can't be ignored because they don't fit the unrealistic idealized versions that we're often presented with. Parenthood is everything all at once: love and sadness and worry and pain and hard times and best times and fear and happiness and every conceivable emotion rolled up into lives that affect one another in ways you just can't anticipate until you're actually living within your own unique version of it. Meghan O'Connell conveyed this whirlwind of chaos perfectly within her memoir without guilt or apology."}, {"userName": "C.

I want to hug the author and tell her that her ability to write openly and honestly about her feelings throughout her pregnancy and beyond is not just freeing, it's empowering and therpeutic! I've always known that, if I were to become a mother, it would not be in the happy, rainbows and sunshine, wish fulfilled, life purpose finding, sort of way. I will likely harbor resentment for my husband, who even now without children, is always productive and always go with the flow. I will likely want people to know me as everything but, or at least everything before, a mom. I will likely not look at my offspring and feel overwhelmed with happiness so much as overwhelmed with fear and anxiety. I shouldn't need someone to say \"me too\" in order to be okay with my own thoughts and emotions, but damn if it doesn't feel good to hear it any way. In just over 5 months, I will become a mom. I cringe when I hear that word and I hate everything pastel and I want my husband to feel despair like I do (even though I shouldn't wish this upon him). Here I am, not interested in researching about my future small human, but hungrily reading about a woman who became a parent to a child, struggled and cried, and then found her own sense of joy with her new family IN DUE TIME.

O'Connell offers the most valuable gift a woman can give to other women, which is her unrelenting honesty and vulnerability. But she does so with enough self-awareness and critical thought so as not to conclude her experiences of pregnancy, birth and motherhood apply to everybody. This is a clear-eyed portrayal of one woman's experience, with an author who knows her experience is shared by some women - in fact, many more women than the public understanding reflects. The book didn't improve - nor, importantly, worsen - the prospect of parenthood for me. Rather than comfort or reassure me that there's anything I can do to prepare to avoid the common challenges, the book more-so reinforced the idea that you truly can't predict anything - the birth, the baby, the breastfeeding, the aftermath - and so it's best to go in with as much acceptance as possible. It's a confronting read at times, but refreshing when we're typically marinating in a sea of Insta-parenting perfection and, if you're my age (29) and in a long-term relationship, regularly interrogated about plans for your uterus. I would have loved to see a heavier wielding of O'Connell's wit, only because it is so formidable when it is employed. Will definitely be keeping an eye on future work from this author."}, {"userName": "VeganMedusa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3157657-veganmedusa", "userReview": "So many mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, I read it in about a day, but on the other hand, it was kind of a love to hate exercise. I nearly gave up near the beginning when the author, a 29 year old New Yorker, mentioned that she and her boyfriend were using the 'pull-out method' and she'd gotten pregnant because she'd told him that she'd just finished her period so wasn't fertile. I'd expect that from a 19 year old, but 29? A 29 year old city woman (and man)? I mean, I had a Catholic school education too, but I didn't stay at that level of knowledge for the next decade, you know? At that point I decided she was so stupid that I wasn't interested in anything she could possibly say (later, in the post-birth sex part of the book, I found out her boyfriend is just as stupid and self-centred in his own way). But it sort of became compelling. The shallowness, the self-centredness, the stupidity, the whining. But also, the honesty. And every now and then there'd be a nugget of something real and important. Which in the end, was enough for me to keep going. So, a quick read, which might mean something more to younger women like her (I'm talking early twenties, because I think that's about where her mental/emotional age was)."}, {"userName": "Alexandra", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10825384-alexandra", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this! Not a mother but found the reviews intriguing and really loved the author's authentic voice. As an \"old\" millennial, whatever that means, her inner monologue seemed very true to myself and concerns and thoughts I have. It's fun to hear about the evolution of her relationship through having a child and the ups and downs and her reflection on it (like realizing somewhat after the fact how depressed she was). Hopefully more real reflections like this will help women recognize things like postpartum more easily and feel more comfortable with life when it is not the sunshine-y picture that seemed promised. I didn't find the part about the birth as horrifying or graphic as some reviewers did, but I'm in a medical profession and have been reading more than I want to about the high rates of pregnancy and birth complications lately on NPR so comparatively it wasn't quite as awful..."}], "description": "Operating Instructions\n for the Millennial set: a fiercely honest account of becoming a mother before feeling like a grown up.Meaghan O'Connell always felt totally alienated by the cutesy, sanctimonious, sentimental tone of most writing about motherhood. After getting accidentally pregnant in her twenties, she realized that the book she needed--a brutally honest, agenda-less take on the emotional and existential impact of motherhood--didn't exist. So she decided to write it herself.And Now We Have Everything is O'Connell's brave exploration of transitioning into motherhood as a fledgling young adult. With her dark humor and hair-trigger B.S. detector, O'Connell addresses the pervasive imposter syndrome that comes with unplanned pregnancy, the second adolescence of a changing postpartum body, the problem of sex post-baby, the weird push to make \"mom friends,\" and the fascinating strangeness of stepping into a new, not-yet-comfortable identity. Most unforgettably, O'Connell brings us into the delivery room as no writer has before, rendering childbirth in all its feverish gore and glory, and shattering the fantasies of a \"magical\" or \"natural\" experience that warp our expectations and erode maternal self-esteem.Channeling fears and anxieties that are, shockingly, still taboo and often unspoken, And Now We Have Everything is an unflinchingly frank, funny, and intimate motherhood story for our times, about needing to have a baby in order to stop being one yourself.", "title": "And Now We Have Everything: On Motherhood Before I Was Ready", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35959678-and-now-we-have-everything", "average": 4.15, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1509033722l/35959678.jpg", "reviews": 196, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4107475.Meaghan_O_Connell", "name": "Meaghan O'Connell"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Parenting", "Feminism", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35959678-and-now-we-have-everything", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37548422-and-now-we-have-everything", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23517167-a-birth-story", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8540473-coming-and-crying", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11968729-reverence-library", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
