Ha! But I\u2019d do anything for some extra excitement. Nuff said. This is the author's debut. I don\u2019t see that she has anything to improve on if I was to be honest! I just love her original stories, she's got a flair for it.This one in particular shows me we are of the same era. I love when the books I read contain little tid bits of pop culture references that I can relate to and really bond with. Teletubies and Bananarama\u2019s song \u2018Venus\u2019 being a couple of them. The Kettle triplets jumping around to this song with abandoned pleasure made me smile. I smiled all the way through with this Aussie story. All the characters were quirky and real, the story line funny, and every step of the way was completely engaging. \"He\u2019s experiencing empathy for the first time in his life\u201d said Cat with a noticeable lack of empathy. \u2018About time.\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s just surprised, poor Dad\u2019, said Gemma, who had always suffered from excessive empathy. Lyn had seen her walking down a street of parked cars, winding each time she saw a parking ticket on a windscreen.\" (This is pretty close to me actually, I empathise with Gemma, I really really do!)Here\u2019s another bit of gold \u201cSomeone did a ladylike fart during Beginners Yoga for Mums-to-Be\u201d. It doesn\u2019t get better than that. Down to earth and a touch self-deprecating, AKA real!I love a good contemporary read, it\u2019s not all about rocket science, and for me it\u2019s all about enjoyable bantering fiction. I met Liane Moriarty this year and am not at all surprised that I love every book she\u2019s written. The little stories she told at the event I attended I can relate back to all her work and enjoy knowing that little bit more. Highly recommended reading if you\u2019re like me and enjoy being able to laugh at yourself, it's full of all the non-serious funny stuff you could ever imagine.

( Originally published in 2003)I had heard so much about Liane Moriarty I put several of her books on hold at the library a little while back. I read them as they became available, in no particular order. I love, love, love this author\u2019s style of writing. But, while I cool my heels, still waiting on \u2018Truly, Madly, Guilty\u201d to become available, at my library, (llllooooonnnnnngggg wait!),I reached back deeper into the author\u2019s backlisted titles and pulled this one out of the hat. Everything I love about Moriarty is evident in this novel, the almost whimsical quality of the story, the dark undertones, and loads of emotions and family drama, but alas, this one fell a little flat for me. I suppose it was partly the lopsided way things turned out, with poor Cat getting a raw deal all the way around, and around, and around, while her sisters toy with and flirt with fate and suffer little or no consequences. The ending, well, frankly, I thought it sucked. While the reader gets a slight glimmer of hope for our poor trod upon Cat, it was not enough to make up for all she went through. Sorry, but the HEA must be firmer than that, especially after putting me through an emotional spin cycle. The humor that is another trademark of this author was also muted. I usually find myself laughing out loud at the sharp wit and humor, even when it has a slightly dark edge to it, but nothing in the dialogue tickled my funny bone, and the sisters often got on my nerves.I suppose I enjoyed the little bit of irony involving the triplets parents the best, although it was not the HEA I was anticipating in the book, I suppose it will just have to do. I may have to write the author and beg her to publish an additional epilogue for this one to assure me Cat\u2019s life turned to be as full as the rest of her family\u2019s. For some reason, I really need to know the details! Overall, I was a little bummed out over this one, but I\u2019m still a big fan and still feel very excited about catching up with all of Ms. Moriarty's backlisted titles and about reading the new book! 2 stars"}, {"userName": "Cathrine \u262f\ufe0f ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22600410-cathrine", "userReview": "2.5 starsMy least favorite of the authors books.

It's told in each of their voices, transitioning from past to present as they each face a critical issue. The dynamics of how they interact with each other is also an important aspect of their story. I very much enjoyed this story as the character development was outstanding. I felt I truly knew each sister and how they would behave at every juncture. The transitions to the past were timely as they aptly provided context for the three women's present characterizations. The twists in their stories, especially Gemma's, were stunning, catching me off guard. The men in their lives created even more texture to the story as they represented choices that deeply impacted their individual and collective destinies. Lastly, there were passages provided intermittently throughout the book that were observations by strangers. That was a unique device that gave additional insights about the family interactions and it really worked for me. I really liked the story and the audio performance though it was sometimes difficult to initially identify when the story was transitioning. Otherwise, I thought the narrator perfectly captured the characters and I could always distinguish the three women.

The ex-advertising copywriter delivers Sydney based tales featuring gritty women who have loud, forthright conversations and live complex, secret ridden lives. I\u2019ve heard her output described as chic lit, but but this feels like a diminishment of what are uniformly snappy, funny and often hard hitting stories. My advice is grab one and judge for yourselves \u2013 if you\u2019re not already a convert, that is.In this book \u2013 her first \u2013 we are introduced to triplets, the Kettle sisters. They\u2019re enjoying a birthday meal in a busy restaurant and raucously celebrating their shared milestone. Then it all kicks off. It\u2019s typical of the author\u2019s style that we\u2019re then taken back in time to a date some twelve months or so earlier and walked through events leading up to that night. I wouldn\u2019t call it a mystery novel but we do discover a few hidden facts along the way. It\u2019s really a story built on excellent character development and superb dialogue. It\u2019s funny and snappy and sharp. It\u2019s also sad and thought provoking, with some dark issues lurking in the background. All in all, It\u2019s just fantastically entertaining.Moriarty uses some brilliant tricks to keep the whole thing fresh. She regularly slips in short vignettes of people who have observed the triplets at various times in their lives. And she switches perspective regularly, so we see the story from different angles. The result is a tale that kept me on my toes. I know from experience that she\u2019s likely to spring a surprise or two and, in truth, I had no idea what events would unfold in order to bring me to the fateful night.I listened to this on audio, as I have all of her books, read by the wonderful Caroline Lee. She brings the whole thing alive with huge energy and aplomb, the only minor slip up being the imposition of a Geordie accent on a Mancunian. A minor issue, for which I forgive her.This book is probably a 4.5 \u2013 stopped from a top mark simply by the lack of a killer twist. But I did love it. I\u2019ve listed below my ratings for the stand alone books I\u2019ve read from this author (she\u2019s also dashed off a three volume series I\u2019ve yet to check out). But I\u2019m gobbling up her books up at some rate and am thankful she has a new book coming out this year.The Last Anniversary 3*What Alice Forgot 4*The Husband\u2019s Secret 4*Big Little Lies 5*The Hypnotists Love Story \u2013 not read yet but already loaded and just waiting its turn!"}, {"userName": "Tan Markovic", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65256214-tan-markovic", "userReview": "A stong 4 out of 5.Another funny, drama-filled, soap opera like, juuuuicy novel from Liane Moriarty and it's crept in my favourites from her.The story follows three triplet sisters, in their thirties, who all have very different personalities and outlooks on life and explores how their complex relationships with each other withstand all the dramas that life throws at them. Spoiler alert: a lot.Despite all their dramas and some dark themes being explored, the author is SO good at still creating humour, and I laughed throughout this entire novel.I think what makes me love Liane Moriarty's storytelling is the sheer honesty with which she describes her characters and their inner thoughts. I continuously find myself thinking 'Yes! That's exactly what I thought, but never dared say it'.Between each chapter, small episodes are featured from onlooking strangers and their views on the sisters interactions from when they were young to present day. These offered an important dynamic to the story I feel; showing that despite not always being able to see it first hand, they were very close and had strong relationships with each other.I absolutely whizzed through this book it grabbed my attention from the get go.

The book then goes back to the events leading up to the big blowout to provide some context.Having read quite a few Liane Moriarty the twists and turns in this book were predictable, and I felt like this is one of my least favorite of her books due to the ending. Moriarty is usually great at tying up all the loose ends at the end, but this one is left open ended which I didn't enjoy as much. I like that she makes everything look so bleak and then ends on a happy note, and while this one did sort of end on a happy note, it wasn't as happy as it could have been I suppose, which is partially why I read her books.They are an escape from the usual dark books I read, and unfortunately this one wasn't much of an escape."}, {"userName": "Carla Caruso", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13172407-carla-caruso", "userReview": "How have I only just properly discovered Aussie author Liane Moriarty? I loved this book, and can't believe it's her first novel (she now has many more under her belt) - it's so richly written. I kept seeing Liane's name about the place, then was drawn to reading her debut tome as it's about triplet sisters and I'm preggers with twins. Well, I will definitely be searching out more of her titles.The Kettle sisters depicted and their various partners, exes and rellies all seem so real and will 'live on' in your mind - no joke. I particularly loved the quirky, dreamy triplet Gemma - the other two, Cat and Lyn, were a bit harder around the edges, but very realistically painted.The book touched on some heavy issues, from miscarriage to domestic abuse, without losing its overall light, cheery tone.My only tiny niggle was that there were often flashbacks or time-jumps right when something big and dramatic happened and you wanted to see what would unfold next. But, in saying that, it was likely a clever tactic by Liane to keep you turning the pages.

I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as her more popular Big Little Lies, but I did.It may not be literary fiction, but Moriarty can write characters incredibly well. Most importantly, their stories are so relatable, so real. It goes without saying that being about triplet sisters made things even more interesting as most of us are intrigued by twins, triplets and so on. Moriarty masterfully interspersed bystanders' povs with the sisters'. It works really well to convey the plot and, especially, the characters' many layers. This is a novel about family, relationships, sibling relationships that can be intense, vicious at times, but also so loving and all consuming, as only relationships between women can be.4.5 starsThis novel goes towards my Aussie Authors Challenge 2018 on www.bookloverbookreviews.com"}, {"userName": "Ali (Readaholic \u221e)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31852697-ali-readaholic", "userReview": "\u201cIt was always like that.

Cat, Gemma and Lyn Kettle are a strange sight when they are together and their lives take turns over the next year that no one could foresee. Right from the beginning I was hooked as the book opens to the sisters celebrating their Thirty-fourth birthday. The story then jumps back to the previous year and all that has happened in the fascinating triplets lives. The story is told from multiple perspectives. I found it relatively easy to follow along with the point of view at each point in the story. I found the interaction between the three girls and the other characters in the story very entertaining. The characters are well developed and very believable. I loved each of the sisters and their individual personalities. They have a very lovable and dysfunctional family dynamic that really did have me laughing out loud quite a few times. Great summer reading!

I suppose I can forgive her since this was her debut novel. I really liked the pace of this book. Stories that drag tend to bore me, as I'm sure they do most people. There was always something happening or some type of drama needing to be resolved in this story. I really particularly love how, at least in all of the stories I have read from her, Liane Moriarty starts her books with some type of tragedy, but you don't know who it happened to, who did it, or why they did it. It makes for an interesting read.This story only got three stars from me because, as I stated before, I have a little bit higher expectations from this author than what was provided in this book.

She's really come a long way since this one. Or should I say, she and her characters have really matured over time. I was not following, understanding, or caring about anyone here at first. But the more I got to know the characters, or really just Gemma (the triplet who was fraternal), the more I liked it. The other two triplets were identical twins, so Gemma was more unique and her sisters let her know how different she was. I didn't care for Cat or Lyn. For three sisters turning 34 years old, I thought, they sure didn't act it. But thinking back to when I was 33, I was still doing some pretty silly things too.This would be my least favorite of Moriarity's many books.

It was fascinating how upset they got about them.\u201dHaving been quite disappointed in my last Moriarty read (Truly Madly Guilty) I was very pleased with Three Wishes. I think this was her debut novel, and man it was good. Probably the funniest one I've read by her. Sure, her other books also have lough out loud moments, but this one was loaded with them. Also, Moriarty needs to write more books because I have only two to go before I've read all of her works. I've just had such a craving for women fiction this year, particularly Liane Moriarty's women fiction . It's only March of 2018, but I've already read 3 of her books. \u200b\u201cYou're having one of those days of accumulating misery when you argue violently with someone in a position of power: a bank teller, a dry cleaner, a three-year-old.\u201dI don't know why recently I've been having such craving for women fiction. Maybe because I'm getting closer and closer to being thirty, and her books usually focus on women of that age. Maybe because I cannot get enough of family drama, social life problems, motherhood, relationships and anything else that life throws at women in her books. But I inhale simply inhale her books. \u201cThe year Lyn turned twenty-two someone switched her life over to fast-forward and forgot to change it back again. That\u2019s how it felt.\u201d\u200bThe story follows three women, in this case triplets, and their lives - husbands, kids, family relations. Most of Moriarty's books follow this patter, and in some cases it does gets repetitive, but this book felt fresh for some reason. Maybe because it was her first work, when she found her style. Maybe because the way the story was told brought different perspectives, I don't know, but it was very, very enjoyable. Surprisingly I enjoyed all of the characters in this book, all of the female characters at least: Gemma, Lyn and Cat - all brought something to the table that I could either relate to or just learn from. Gemma was probably my favorite though. Three Wishes deals with grief, separation, siblings relations, divorce, infertility and many more issues. I loved how Moriarty never pulled her punches and always wrote things that I thought myself at times, but was too shamed to admit them. She painted her characters real and flowed, and I loved that. There was no magic solution, no over the top happy ending - it was just life. \u200bDefinitely recommend.

It changes p.o.v. between the 3 sisters and also has little pointless excerts from a strangers p.o.v. that is never discussed in the book. It really doesn't go anywhere and I didn't learn anything. Lyn is married to her husband (once a married man whose marriage she ruined), a 2 year old terror of a daughter, and a teen step-daughter (teen says it all). She runs a small breakfast catering company and has the perfect life. Really, she has no issues. Gemma, is the whishy-washy one. She was once engaged to a moody, controlling man who so happened to walk in front of a bus, literally. Since then, she has floated around and house sits. She has no permanent place or person in her life. She meets Charlie and finds him to be \"the one\", however, she struggles with the fact that his sister is having an affair with her sister Cat's husband. She eventually becomes pregnant and in the end, she's with Charlie and they live happily ever after.Cat has a great husband (or so she thinks) and a great job. Until one evening her and Dan are watching a movie and he subtly tells her he's cheated on her. Cat is the epitomy of what a cheated wife would feel like (I assume) and after having him sleep on the couch a couple weeks, tries to take him back with a little dose of counseling. She has had a history of miscarriages, but when she finds out she's pregnant again, they try to make it work. Not until she miscarries again does he reveal he's been continuing his affair for a year. As predictable as it can get, Dan ends up with the girl he was having an affair with, Cat ends up alone and desperately wanting a baby, Lyn is fine and Gemma has a happy ending.

Based on publication dates, this title appears to be her first novel (at least her first book listed on goodreads). As good as Three Wishes is, I can honestly say she has gotten better and better with each novel. Three Wishes follows three thirty-three-year-old triplet sisters and describes a year in their lives when their worlds are turned upside down. The way the story and POV's are set up creates some time hopping which was a bit distracting/confusing for me at times, and in turn caused my connection to the story to ebb and flow, but overall it was minimal and that is my only real complaint. I think I have said this in every review I have written for Ms. Moriarty, but I'll say it again: It is as if she has lived the lives of her characters and has personally battled every issue she writes about. Her characters are that real, the emotions are that palpable, and the thought processes and responses are that relatable. In Three Wishes, issues surrounding miscarriage, domestic abuse, and infidelity are addressed. Something I noticed about this book that I haven't seen in some of her others is the use of humor to buffer the intensity of the issues addressed. There were a few parts when I literally laughed out loud. But it's important to note that the overall feel of this book is not light and funny. It's deeply real, it's painful, and just as some parts made me laugh, other parts brought tears to my eyes. I would recommend Three Wishes to existing fans of Liane Moriarty. If you haven't read Ms. Moriarty before then read this one and just know that her novels just keep getting better and better!My favorite quote:\"Do you fight a lot? Do triplets fight more than normal?\" \"The Kettle triplets do but I don't think we're normal. Mom used to take us to a club for triplets when we were little and some of them adored one another. We were so disgusted, we threw rocks at them. Little savages...We got expelled from the triplet club for a whole month.\""}, {"userName": "Chachic", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3294750-chachic", "userReview": "Originally posted here.One of my goals this year is to do more readalongs because they're a lot of fun. I read Three Wishes by Liane Moriarty along with two good friends, Janice and Holly. I first discovered Liane Moriarty, Australian author of contemporary fiction, when I read \nWhat Alice Forgot\n last year. I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to read the rest of her books. The cute cupcake cover for Three Wishes is deceiving. I thought I'd be reading a book about quirky triplets, something light and fun. Maybe there would be a couple of problems thrown in but I definitely wasn't expecting the book to feel as emotionally heavy as it did. Also, the synopsis describes the book as a family comedy but I didn't think it was funny. The narrative does change from one Kettle sister to another but I feel like the focus is more on Cat's marriage problems and how her husband cheated on her. As a result, she's a very angry person throughout most of the book and that affects the dynamics with her sisters. It also felt like Cat, Lyn and Gemma weren't as close as they wanted people to think. Sure, they meet regularly and they talk to each other all the time, but it felt like they weren't really there for each other when it mattered. Now I don't want to mention spoilers but it did frustrate me that the sisters kept major life events from each other. Some snippets that I included in Goodreads status updates:\"The bills would keep on coming, no matter what else was happening in your life and that was good because it gave you purpose. You worked so you could pay them. You rested on the weekends and generated more bills. Then you went back to work to pay for them. That was the reason for getting up tomorrow. That was the meaning of life.\"Also, this:\"Death was the hot bath you promised yourself while you endured small talk and uncomfortable shoes. You could stop pretending to have a good time when you were dead.\"Not very cheerful, right? I'm sorry to say that I didn't enjoy reading Three Wishes as much as I was expecting. I wasn't invested in any of the Kettle sisters and I just wanted to finish the book so I can move on to a better one. It has taken me a while to write this review and I'm already on another readalong with Janice and Holly - we're reading Whiskey Road by Karen Siplin. We haven't been lucky in our readalong choices so far but I'm keeping my fingers crossed. If you're interested in giving Liane Moriarty's writing a try, I suggest that you start with What Alice Forgot. It was a more enjoyable read for me than Three Wishes. Although like I always say, people don't always react the same way even if we do share reading tastes so you might like this book a lot more than I did. I've seen more positive reviews so it may not just be a book for me."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32014561-sara", "userReview": "It is actually a 3.5 stars rounded up to 4.I have some mixed feelings about this book, on one side, it gripped me from the start, and I liked reading it. I had difficulties putting it down, which is the good part. However, upon finishing it, I was left with a bittersweet after taste. This book made me nervous, and left me unsatisfied.The writing style at the beginning is a bit confusing, but once you get used to it, it becomes enjoyable. It is the story of three twins, and the narrative perspective keeps changing between the three, which gives you insights on each sister. Plus interspersed in the book there are some anecdotes about the triplet narrated by random people that are cute.There are many references to their time growing up, I found these parts to be somewhat a bit too heavy, I skip read through some of their juvenile stories, or the stories about the grandma. When a topic is not much about the main plot it bores me quickly, there were a tiny bit too many in the book I think, some not that relevant.However, what made me nervous was the ending; the review is going to get a bit spoilery from now on, even if I am not giving away facts, in fact, I am not even giving you names. So if you have not read the book yet and don\u2019t want any anticipation, I suggest you STOP HERE. If you have read the book, I would like to know if it was just me, or if you had the same impression\u2026Sister 1: She has a perfect life from the start, she keeps it throughout the book, with some minor, minor, minor, did I mention minor?, hiccups. She even gets annoyed at the suffering of sister 3, she irritated me a bit. She is a know-it-all \u2026 I didn\u2019t find her very sympathetic; she could have been more understanding and less judging. However, she\u2019s not all bad\u2026 but I would never ever want her as a sister! (Especially to be compared to, I sympathized with sister3 and adored sister2)Sister 2: She is the adorable kind, with her head in the clouds, always good. A bit distracted, but who cares? She had a rough past, but her path in the book is upwards until she reaches the hilltop and gets her well-deserved happy ending.Sister 3: She is so abused by the author I was appalled. It is one blow after the other, a relentless succession of sad happenings, and each one worst and more painful than the previous. In a couple of points I was crying for her, like really sobbing! The scene in the park was heartbreaking, I was glad nobody was around to witness me cry that hard over a book. After all this suffering she doesn\u2019t get any real retribution, you just get a faraway flicker of hope, a wink of the eye and that\u2019s it. It was infuriating, after all that suffering both her sisters get/keep the wonderful life, and she, well she doesn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to imagine what her happy ending could become... I wanted to read it! As I said in the beginning, this lack of retribution left me nervous, and unsatisfied!"}, {"userName": "Susan Elizabeth Phillips", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5890362-susan-elizabeth-phillips", "userReview": "If you love \u201csister books\u201d as I do, this is another winner from Moriarty."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5609944-bonnie", "userReview": "This is the third book I've read by Liane Moriarty and I think one of the reasons I've notched five stars for all of them is not because I necessarily 'enjoyed' reading them but because I couldn't stop thinking about them. \"Three Wishes\" also tackles uncomfortably sticky relationships with friends and siblings and spouses.

Gemma is the flighty one and can't seem to hold onto a job, or a boyfriend to save her life. While sarcastic Cat has always been in control and ready to take charge especially when it comes to her job and her marriage. And organized Lyn seems to have it all: the career, the loving husband, and the kids. As these three independent yet devoted sisters get ready to celebrate their thirty-fourth birthday, each will deal with heartaches and joys aplenty. From rocky marriages to unexpected pregnancies and even long-secret revelations brought to light, these three women manage to conquer each new obstacle in the trademark Kettle way - together.I suppose I should go ahead and say that Liane Moriarty will now be added to my auto-buy list of chick lit authors. Up there with Jennifer Cruise and Julie James, Moriarty manages to capture the distinct personalities of these three dynamic women in such an endearing way without ever glossing over their less than savory attributes. Cat, Gemma, and Lyn are human. They make mistakes. But they each love deeply and are fiercely loyal to each other which makes me love them that much more. I adored their constant banter, which never fails to highlight their individual temperaments and how they continually poke fun at their infamous triplet status.Cleverly added to the sisters' narrative, Liane Moriarty randomly included various accounts of strangers memories of meeting the triplets. As odd as it may seem, these vignettes (often hilarious) though from an outsiders point of view, often helped me to get a better handle on certain events and made each sister that much more understandable and accessible. Very clever Ms. Moriarty.Three Wishes is an utter winner all about the highs and lows of being part of a close-knit family of sisters. I simply cannot wait to see what I discover from this fabulous author next."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7350746-rachel", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. I was gonna say adored it but I'm not sure if it's a lifelong adoration or a moment in time adoration. But the important thing is I really enjoyed this title while I read it. It's especially relatable to those of us with weird dysfunctional families who mean well and laugh out loud funny while tackling serious moments in life. It's about the individual's lives but also the life of A FAMILY, despite little things like the parents (of the original family for the purpose of the book) divorce and miscarriages and marital discord in the now and yet the family is resilient which helps bolster the adult children of the family and their families and its another of life's circles as their individual resiliency also bolsters the family's unity and future so that they all grow and are there for the upcoming generation.  As with any good book in particular by this author my biggest regret is I'm done reading it. No matter what genre you like even if this is just a really smart \"beach read\" for you, you'll enjoy it I think. I'm sorry if I'm not actually saying a ton but I like to err on the NO SPOILER side.

Together, laughter, drama, and mayhem seem to follow them. But apart, each is dealing with her own share of ups and downs.
