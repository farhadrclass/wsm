I could see something like it really happening. They outlawed guns, so some Government scientist in the US developed a flu to use in the war going on in the Middle East (which I don't know how you fight in a war without guns) Maybe I missed that part. anyway, the wrong people caught wind of what the US were doing, and came here to the Alpha tower where the studies on the virus took place. Some crazy Bastards released the infected test subjects into the US and now it's survival time. The story takes place around this father who's trying to save his six year old son from the flu infested flesh eating zombies. They're strong, fast, and seems to have some type of intelligence.

Something intense and the total opposite to a sweet love story. So I was a little (well, maybe a lot) excited to be drawn in not only by the cover, but by the blurb of this story, and was sucked right in from the get go.I looooved the main character, Rhys in this story. He's just an average guy, getting on with his mundanely average life, and going through average day to day struggles. There's nothing exceptional about him, except for his love for his son whom he rarely gets to see. Yet despite his 'averageness' you can't help but love his spirit and his evolving strength throughout the hell which unfolds within his life.This story is extremely well written, and flowed beautifully for me. I'm so glad I came across this little gem, and can't wait to read book 2 in the series, or anything else by this fabulous author for that matter.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fA Five Star Edge Of Your Seat Read"}, {"userName": "Lorraine Southern", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51182405-lorraine-southern", "userReview": "4 stars ****Thoroughly enjoyed this.

I loved the cover and really liked the premise -- post-apocalyptic survival thriller. Didn't know how the key disaster/event (a plague) would play out, only wished for no zombies (not a big fan of those, you know).Anyway, I started reading. And got hooked right on the first scene. This story is raw in its portrait of the human nature and the instinct one has to survive. Shocking many times, but necessarily so in this kind of tale. Very well done. The tone was set straightaway and showed the punches wouldn't be pulled; nothing, no one, could be taken for granted, except that Rhys would live 'till the end of the book -- and that only because I already knew he would be in the next one.I loved to be shown first hand how the plague was unleashed. How the actions of a few changed the fate of so many (as we all know it happens in real life). While I watched the crisis develop I couldn't but wish for the players to just do something to stop it. \"No, don't do that; leave!\" \"Do not listen to him. DO. NOT.\" But of course, they did. And the predictability on those parts only enhanced the feeling of helplessness, so similar to the way the characters felt. It brought them to life. Though they'd been so well presented earlier they were fully human beings, and close to my heart (except for You Know Who when you read the book), when Hell broke loose. This story is still playing in my mind now and I expect it will continue to do so for a while. Will I read it again? Well, were there not a sequel I would say, definitely. But since at least one exists already, I'll say maybe; it depends on how the whole picture will end. So far, all I can say is I didn't want to put it down, nor to have it end. And it left me craving for the next installment. Never mind that it's full of zombies.Note: I was lucky enough to be offered a copy of this book by the author."}, {"userName": "Jaffa Kintigh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33812227-jaffa-kintigh", "userReview": "The Alpha Plague is an apocalyptic survival thriller done right. Working well as a stand-alone though in actuality the first of a series, this novel covers just the first few hours of a viral plague: The Blurb:Rhys is an average guy who works as average job in Summit City--a purpose built government complex on the outskirts of London. The Alpha Tower stands in the center of the city. An enigma, nobody knows what happens behind its dark glass. Rhys is about to find out. At ground zero and with chaos spilling out into the street, Rhys has the slightest of head starts. If he can remain ahead of the pandemonium, then maybe he can get to his loved ones before the plague does.Falling within the broader category of zombie apocalypses, this take is toward the rage spectrum of 28 Days Later rather than the lumbering Walking Dead variety, which makes it all the worse for Rhys and his kick-ass partner-by-circumstance Vicky in his quest to escape Summit City and save his 6 y.o. son, Flynn, who's at school some miles away.Rhys and Vicky are fallible protagonists with limited resources, but courage and determination worthy of rooting for in this non-stop action thriller."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46407197-anna", "userReview": "Read this for my fandom book club whose theme for February is Sci-Fi, I honestly could not put the book down.

Due to a biological warfare experiment escaping, a plague of what can only be called instant-zombies is released from it. Scurrying ahead of the growing plague are Rhys and Vicky, trying to stay alive long enough to escape the island and reach Rhys\u2019s son.I read the 260 or so pages of this novel in a day, which demonstrates how fast paced it is. The chapters are short and all end on enough of a cliff-hanger to keep reading. The characters \u2013 essentially just two \u2013 are well enough developed and interesting enough to care about.The plot is essentially 28 Days Later compressed to something more like 28 Seconds Later. The zombies are instantly produced and very fast moving, and the island is quickly overwhelmed. Complicating matters is an apparent lack of guns or weapons, which seems to include the police not having any tasers or riot control hardware.The story is competently written and the action clear and concise. But there are oddities. Rhys seems to regard Vicky as a romantic opportunity rather than a partner in survival, even in tense scenes where they\u2019re running for their lives. There\u2019s a constant and monotonous use of one profanity (You know the one: Four letters, starts with an F).

Sometimes, we just need a little of what we know done well. The Alpha Plague was that for me.Rhy's motivation throughout is to get to his son. I can understand that Vicky's participation in getting him off the island stems from guilt, but the way their relationship grows in a few hours felt a little forced. I did enjoy how they bounced off of each other, each with their own personality traits and opinions which aided in keeping them both alive.The storyline behind the 'release' of the infection is well believable in this day and age. Biological warfare gone wrong is a scary thought, especially if the enemy know what you are doing and how to use it to their advantage.

Then the forced guilt trip to save his son. Her quick desire to help risk her life for this poor slob who was so unfit, it was hardly believable he could keep up with her, much less accomplish some of the feats he accomplished. Throughout the whole book he talks about how important his son is, and how its so important that he save his son that when Vicky sacrifices herself so he can get to his son, what does Rhys do? He ignores his change to save his son to go save Vicky who only put herself in danger so HE COULD SAVE HIS SON! So much for priorities when you're new best friend is a hot athletic blonde woman 10 years younger than you, eh? Another major gripe for me was the city. A city of office buildings, right? In the train station, Rhys explains that its always empty between work hours because everyone is working. Okay, so why the fuck are there shops everywhere that he and Vicky can escape into if no one in that city is out and about during work hours to shop in them? The city is described as being so generic one gets lost easily in its maze of sameness, so its obviously not a tourist destination. So why is there a florist, and a sports shop and as we find later in the second book there's also a bloody bike shop!? And that's not even the worst thing about these shops. Not only do they not fit in with the description of the city, but for someone writing about the \"future,\" Michael Robertson has completely ignored all modern evidence that the retail industry is dying and will probably be almost non-existent in this future. It's not like this data wasn't available to the author in 2015. Another thing that bothered me was the Sledgehammer conveniently placed at the top of the building being constructed. As someone who owns and uses a sledgehammer on occasion, I could not figure out for the life of me why a sledgehammer would be on the roof of an unfinished skyscraper. That is most commonly a tool for demolition. What clod would heave a 16 lb. sledgehammer up to the top of a skyscraper? For what reason would anyone need it up there? At 16 lbs, is it even rational that someone would accidentally carry it up to the roof? Convenient, yes, rational, no.

If you have ever seen World War Z the movie, and wondered what it would have been like to have been someone on the ground with all of the crazies, trying to escape through all of the diseased as they turned and tried to attack each other, then this is the story you want to read.Rhys is at ground zero when the plague is released and is caught in the maelstrom as the world comes crashing down. Rhys is desperate to find his son Flynn, as well as escape from the horror that is unleashing around him.He meets another woman Vicki, who is also trying to survive, and she reluctantly agrees to help him try and find his son, as she is terrified at what is unfolding around her, knowing that she should just get out whilst she can. Vicki knows what is going on, knows she should get as far away as possible before the world ends. This is an incredibly brutal, and graphically intense story. As a warning to anyone that is not big on language or violence, this is not the book for you, there is a bit of language, and a lot of violence. Of course, with this type of book, the violence is a given, and the language is nothing over the top and is used in an effective way. I really like the Author, and the language issue is just an example of this, some go over the top with it, others just don\u2019t have any (which is just ridiculous in this type of story), but Robertson had a good blend that accounts for reality, but will also not offend the majority of people. The desperate battle of Rhys and Vicki as they fight their way through this city under siege, trying desperately to get away from these diseased creatures that want nothing more than to rip your throat out is told with breathtaking skill. It is terrifying in its realism, but also thrilling as Rhys and Vicki climb up stairways, onto roofs, ladders, and fight for their lives, all to save a little boy.The characters themselves are incredibly real, from the scared Father, who is not perfect, but realises today is the day he has to step up. To Vicki, a girl with secrets of her own, a past she doesn\u2019t want revealed, but with a heart in the right place. Of course, there are thousands of diseased psycho\u2019s ready to tear everything and everyone apart.If you like apocalyptic scenarios \u2013 you have to read this, as it is totally brilliant, and has some good twists and variations. Overall, this is a brilliant book and an exceptional start to a series that is going to be so good, you won\u2019t be able to put it down."}, {"userName": "Walter Scott", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42162845-walter-scott", "userReview": "A thriller that is better than it needed to beFrom the opening sentence to the last one, this is a thrill wide. There are not many main characters \u2013 Rhys and Vicky, primarily. They are fairly normal people. As the story moves forward, you learn a lot about each character, and the characters learn much more about themselves. They have a lot of adapting to figure out. They need to learn to trust each other.There is a zombie-like plague, and the infected run faster than most uninfected humans. Baseball bats figure prominently when Rhys and Vicki encounter the infected, and most of those scenes bring to mind The Walking Dead.But this is not a cookie-cutter zombie story. Michael Roberts has taken the time to build a world in which the characters, settings, and threats will catch you by surprise, and there are a few plot innovations that certainly were new to me.This book, the first of a series, can be downloaded from Amazon for free.

Sure, it emphasises his love but it's not like anyone in a zombie infested city is going to nick it. And besides, isn't it the future? Surely he has an electronic copy.
