You want to despise Giovanni because he is not afraid of the stink of love. You want to kill him in the name of all your lying moralities. And you--you are immoral. You are, by far, the most immoral man I have met in all my life. Look, look what you have done to me. Do you think you could have done this if I did not love you? Is this what you should do to love?\u2019\u201d\nJames Baldwin in Harlem.David is an American living in Paris attempting to find himself. His girlfriend Hella is in Spain taking some time to think about whether she wants to commit the rest of her life to David. Meanwhile David is out of funds and his father is willing to let him starve a bit in the hopes that he will come home. He is, after all, getting a bit old, pushing thirty, to still be looking for himself. There is this legitimate fear that he will never find himself, and if that is the case he might as well come home and rejoin the real world of marriages, careers, and cocktails. He meets Giovanni, not because he is looking for someone, but because he is paying the price of borrowing money from Jacques, an old lecherous American business man who will lend you money, but it will cost you time entertaining him with your presence and your conversation. Hopefully you are not so desperate that it will cost you even more. Jacques finds Giovanni attractive and hopes that David can convince the young man to have a drink with them. The best laid plans of salacious old men rarely bear fruit. They have to be patient and wait for the specter of starvation to land them a pliable playmate. This is one of those times when it all backfires on Jacques, but he will continue to spin a web and wait for a bobble in finances. After all, Paris is an expensive city and with so many young men on the verge of destitution he only has to wait for a tug on one of his many sugared threads. David goes home with Giovanni.\u201dI was trembling. I thought, if I do not open the door at once and get out of here, I am lost. But I knew I could not open the door, I knew it was too late; soon it was too late to do anything but moan. He pulled me against him, putting himself into my arms as though he were giving me himself to carry, and slowly pulled me down with him to that bed. With everything in me screaming No! yet the sum of me sighed Yes.\u201dGiovanni\u2019s Room comes to define David\u2019s whole Parisian experience. \u201dThe table was loaded with yellowing newspapers and empty bottles and it held a single brown and wrinkled potato in which even the sprouting eyes were rotten. Red wine had been spilled on the floor, it had been allowed to dry and it made the air in the room sweet and heavy. But it was not the room\u2019s disorder which was frightening, it was the fact that when one began searching for the key to this disorder one realized that it was not be found in any of the usual places. For this was not a matter of habit or circumstance or temperament; it was a matter of punishment and grief.\u201d\nJames Baldwin in Paris.David is astute enough to recognize that this is not just a fling for Giovanni, but a true attempt to not only find love, but to also escape the past, the present, and an increasingly gloomy looking future. \u201dI understood why Giovanni had wanted me and had brought me to his last retreat. I was to destroy this room and give to Giovanni a new and better life. This life could only be my own, which, in order to transform Giovanni\u2019s, must first become part of Giovanni\u2019s room.\u201dDavid, operating with a safety net, can afford to have an \u201cunnatural\u201d fling, after all he is in France not America, but for Giovanni this is a heart and soul relationship. As David dances around his own desires and the realization that he must eventually straighten up and become a devoted member of heterosexual America it becomes increasingly difficult to know what to do about Giovanni. \u201dThe beast which Giovanni had awakened in me would never go to sleep again; but one day I would not be with Giovanni anymore, And would I then, like all the others, find myself turning and following all kinds of boys down God knows what dark avenues, into what dark places?\u201dHella, like a lifeboat on the horizon, writes to say she has made her choice. She is coming back to Paris to be with David. Elation and dread suddenly tinge the unraveling of all of his loosely conceived relationships.Under the guise of some bizarre logic David decides he must be with a woman, as if to create a demarcation line between Giovanni and Hella. It doesn\u2019t really matter what woman, just a woman. The lucky winner is Sue, but David doesn\u2019t get away without a dagger of remorse pricking his darkening soul. \u201d\u2019Maybe you\u2019ll be lonely again,\u2019 she said, finally. \u2018I guess I won\u2019t mind if you come looking for me.\u2019 She wore the strangest smile I had ever seen. It was pained and vindictive and humiliated but she inexpertly smeared across this grimace a bright, girlish gaiety--as rigid as the skeleton beneath her flabby body. If fate ever allowed Sue to reach me, she would kill me with just that smile.\u201dI\u2019ll leave the rest to you fair reader. There are more twists and turns and the fates of many rest on the resolve of one man and whether he can be honest about his own nature. \nThe Elegant Mr. James BaldwinJames Baldwin\u2019s publisher gave him some advice in regards to this manuscript. He felt he must \u201cburn the book because the theme of homosexuality would alienate him from his readership among black people.\u201d Fortunately, he was wrong. Critics, thank goodness, were kind to the book because of Baldwin\u2019s reputation and status as a writer. Sure this book makes the list of best gay/lesbian books ever written, but it also makes the list of many BEST BOOKS ever written.I\u2019m going to come out of the closet and say I\u2019m a heterosexual male, although why... I\u2019m not sure... except that I\u2019m just wired that way. The same way that the various sexually self-designated people are wired to be attracted to a multitude of diversely sexually oriented people. To say this is a gay novel certainly is not an attempt to denigrate the book, but it does seem to limit the scope of the vision. There is viciousness, lust, loneliness, deception, sorrow, tenderness, despair, and ultimately tragedy that makes this book easily one of the top 100 best books I\u2019ve ever read. Every reader will find something of themselves in this book, maybe not the part of themselves that they want to hold up to the mirror, but certainly a fragment, disdainful in nature or worthy of pity, that can not be denied. This really should be my second or third reading of this novel, but somehow it has been on my radar and fallen off my radar numerous times over the years. A helpful nudge from John Irving in his book In One Person convinced me that I needed to quit dawdling and read this book. The Paris of the 1950s doesn\u2019t exist anymore, but luckily for you and I it is still vibrantly alive in the pages of this book.

I've been avoiding reviewing it, a bit, because it boils so much to the surface. No summary or review could do this book total justice. What Baldwin achieves is a desperate account of two gay-or-bisexual men struggling with their sexuality, their society, and most importantly their identities: identities which are at once masculine and yet deprived of that masculinity by their complicity with a society that doesn't understand them. Baldwin's artistry is formulating a novel about same-sex love that isn't an absurdly supportive utopia nor a bland coming-out story (see: all LGBT literature, most of which is aimed at young adults, and is stylistically reflective of that audience). Giovanni's Room is the dusk to E.M. Forster's dawn in Maurice. Baldwin's real achievement is to make his story universal. The love between Giovanni and David is not a \"homosexual love\" or \"same sex love\" - it's just love, and Baldwin tells us that is all love needs to be to be real. Perhaps it is the effect of reading Barthes that I find myself disdainful towards the self-bulwarking of gay \"otherness\" - newspaper stories which send the overt message of \"gays can do it too!\" actually serve to reinforce that gays are something other than normal. Those stories do not change the perception that \"gays cannot\" but rather reinforce it by providing the exception to the rule. \"A little 'confessed' evil saves one from acknowledging a lot of hidden evil'\" By admitting the small prejudice, you allow the larger prejudices to grow disproportionately. Baldwin refuses to let his novel be about gay men in love, and instead makes it about two people in love. The closest comparison I can find in my literary repertory is The Age of Innocence, which I think is an apt sister novel to Baldwin's. Restrained by a rigged society and his engagement to the fair Hella, David must give up his true passion for Giovanni. But it is so much the worse ending for Giovanni than Ellen Olenska: while Ellen lives a supposedly fulfilling life in Paris, Giovanni rapidly descends to corruption, self-loathing, and death: \n\"If you cannot love me, I will die. Before you came I wanted to die, I have told you many times. It is cruel to have made me want to live only to make my death more bloody.\"\nDavid's role in Giovanni's life is not that of a passive lover, he and Giovanni share something real, a true kinship which David cannot feel for Hella and which Giovanni cannot bear to lose. I find significance in the names of the three lovers, David, Hella, and Giovanni. David is from the Hebrew for beloved, and he is mutually beloved by Hella and Giovanni, though he largely resents those loves, first Hella's then Giovanni's. He feels as burdened by their loves as he does by the constraints of appearances and by society, and so he can never be truly happy, he can never truly relish in the love of another, because he cannot bear to the the object of affection, only the subject. David is profoundly selfish, and profoundly evasive to the attention he receives. He paradoxically wants love but cannot bear the responsibilities that go with it. In the Bible, David is much loved by God, but his sexual transgressions with Bathsheba bring hate and misfortune to him. Baldwin's David likewise betrays Hella, and the war between his compunction and his survival instinct ruin what life remains for him: Giovanni is gone, Hella is gone, what remains of his life is a homelessness (if, in fact, home is where the heart is) and an emptiness. He is inconsolably lost: he is haunted by the past that remains inside him, but also by the past which has escaped him: \nPeople who remember court madness through pain, the pain of the perpetually recurring death of their innocence; people who forget court another kind of madness, the madness of the denial of pain and the hatred of innocence; and the world is mostly divided between madmen who remember and madmen forget.\nDavid manages to be doubly the madman.Hella, derived from \"Helga,\" though with the unavoidable echo of \"Hell,\" means, ironically, \"blessed.\" What is she blessed with? She is naive and insecure, she is alternatively too timid and too bold to find love with David. She chooses a long engagement and spends that time alone in Spain rather than in Paris with David. Hella reminds me very much of James' \"innocents abroad\" - and for that reason I find her being blessed only by way of her avoiding the ultimate corruption of David's black heart. Her blessing seems to her like a curse, but ultimately we feel she is far better off alone than she would be had she tied the know with our narrator, a man so confused and self-loathing he is incapable of loving anyone. For David, he knows that life with Hella would be a \"Hell\" to him, it would be to chain him to something less than love, something like friendship, but which would block him forever from his true passion. His love for Giovanni has made love for Hella impossible, and marriage to her would be a constant reminder of what he has lost.Giovanni is a derivative from the Hebrew for \"God's Gift\" - and he is a blessing to David. Giovanni shows David what love is capable of being, what it means to find love and solace in another human on this Earth. But David cannot accept this gift. He grows hateful of it. It is not love or deference for Hella which makes David give up Giovanni, but his own blindness and self-hatred. He is not deserving of Giovanni's love, and it makes us hateful to ourselves, even the most selfish of us, to receive something in the name of our merits when we have not lived up to those merits. Those undeserved gifts are a constant reminder of our inadequacies and instead of raising us up they tear us asunder from the inside-out. Giovanni is the gift of real freedom, the freedom of choice - the gift that God bestowed on man. \"For nothing is more unbearable, once one has it, than freedom.\" David cannot bear the responsibility of choice: particularly the choice between a precarious bliss with Giovanni and an assured unhappiness with Hella."}, {"userName": "Dolors", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors", "userReview": "It is under the foreign sky of Paris, where identity is protected by anonymity and the most darkest secrets do not transcend the limits of a room, that David, an American young man, is forced to face the convoluted layers of the true nature of his identity. Told in the first-person narrator, Giovanni's Room bewilders the reader because of the perturbing sensitivity with which Baldwin portrays an extremely delicate predicament; that of listening to the self-deprecating inner voices that corrode the consciousness of those who deny their true selves for the sake of indoctrinated conventionalism and a false sense of security. Desire, repression and an imposed sense of duty present a battle of sorts that is embodied in the deadly love triangle formed by David, his betrothed Hella and his lover Giovanni, who, unlike David, accepts his homosexuality as his only reality. Frightened by the consequences of acknowledging his strong feelings for Giovanni, David enters a spiral of self-deception that drags Hella down to the gutters of an atavistic marriage that complies with the rigid social structures of the American way of life that doesn't contemplate love between equals. Deep down, David's dilemma runs deeper than his stubborn denial for the sake of appearances, his moral struggle discloses a man who doesn't want to dispense with the inborn social status associated to gender. This book is an obscure, passionate and explicit defiance against racial and gender bias discrimination. Baldwin's deliberate choice to construct a story in which all the characters are white and to bestow thematic relevance to homosexuality is a public denouncement of the preestablished canons promoted by a comfortable majority that sets the boundaries of a mainstream value system.The image of the empty room with its crumbling walls and a tousled bed is spine-chilling in its validity because it cuts across the apology for the homosexual rights. It is also a universal metaphor that symbolizes that part of ourselves that we desperately want to escape from in a blind struggle against our deepest fears, against the foibles that we agonize over to conceal at all costs, against the irrepressible need for acceptance, even if that means to sacrifice those we love the most, even if that means to sentence ourselves to live of inessential memories and become the ghostly shadow of our past desires. Beautiful and terrible, \u201dGiovanni\u2019s Room\u201d is in the end a painful and bitingly honest introspection into the infernos of the nature of humankind, for as David turns his back and leaves the room again and again, we fool ourselves into believing that had we been in his place, we would have acted differently, would have had courage to be fair, would have been more sincere with ourselves and our needs and those of our beloveds.Wouldn\u2019t we?\u201cUntil I die there will be moments, moments seeming to rise up out of the ground like Macbeth\u2019s witches, when his face will come before me, the face in all its changes, when the exact timbre of his voice and tricks of his speech will nearly burst my ears, when his smell will overpower my nostrils.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Rowena", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena", "userReview": "I wasn't sure any Baldwin book would surpass his Go Tell is to the Mountain, which I loved, but this one was even better and an immediate favourite. This story was wonderfully-written and explored a gay storyline which I have never encountered in African-American writing from Baldwin's era.Supposedly quite a few prolific African-American writers were not such big fans of Baldwin due to this reason.This story is set in Paris and is about an American man, David, who is in love with both a man, Giovanni, and a woman, Hella. He really struggles to come to terms with his sexuality,and to reconcile his inner conflict. Baldwin really captures the Parisian atmosphere, and it's obvious he was well-acquainted with the city. Reading his depiction of Paris has really activated my wanderlust. There's more to the story than the gay storyline, though. Questions are raised about authenticity, the meaning of home, whether we act out of fear or love, etc.I can honestly say, I have never read writing quite like it before. This is one I plan on purchasing to re-read."}, {"userName": "Huda Yahya", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7878381-huda-yahya", "userReview":

He is the reason I read (or at least one of the reasons) good fiction. It transports me into the experience of the other. His writing is a gift. The emotions of this novel are expressed as if Baldwin's heart was set aflame in Paris. In Giovanni's room, Baldwin carves his pain and his struggle with fire into the oppressive clouds of the Parisian night. I sort of knew what I was wading into reading Giovanni's Room. I knew Baldwin was gay and this was considered both a great novel AND a great piece of gay fiction. It is hard to imagine, however, Baldwin ever wanting to be dropped into ANY corner, locked into any room. Black. Gay. Saint. Yes, the man was certainly all those, but he was also so much more.I don't want to come across as presumptuous, but I think Baldwin would reject the idea that this is a gay novel. I think Baldwin is expressing the anguish and the pain felt by ALL those who are denied (for whatever reason) the ability to freely love. The closet is far too dark, far too cold, far too confining, and does not allow for the other. Baldwin is teaching that we NEED the other to be human. Baldwin's novels are essentially that. They transcend race, sexuality, gender. They are about the need to be recognized, loved, and free. It reminds me, someone who has been prodigiously privileged because of my race (white), sexuality (straight), gender (cis) about the pain others go through just to catch a moment of things I take for granted every day."}, {"userName": "Iris", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17717848-iris", "userReview": "I am in awe of James Baldwin's seamless way with words.

The motif of water and the ocean and its metaphorical association with time, Giovanni's room itself, the inescapable self and claustrophobia particularly struck me- I feel overwhelmed and shaken by this tragic, beautiful, poignant and haunting novel. There is so much of literary and aesthetic worth to be explored in this book and also so much to be said about human psychology and consciousness, about the dangers of lying to oneself and hurting others, the dangers of self-hatred and lack of acceptance. I long to read another of Baldwin's books.

There is darkness all around him, there is silence in him. Then the door opens and he stands alone, the whole world falling away from him. And the brief corner of the sky seems to be shrieking, though he does not hear a sound. Then the earth tilts, he is thrown forward on his face in darkness, and his journey begins.\n\nSometimes you read a book and you suddenly find yourself hijacked by a form of spellbinding intensity that spews from a participant narrator. You're pulled into the room, Giovanni's Room, and you soon find yourself emotionally involved with David's mental battle. You may not even like David, or like the way he treats people (his fiancee and his lover ), and yet, you're with him, rooting for him during his most piercing revelations. You even have sympathy for his dilemmas and meanders. But why is this? Blame Baldwin. Blame it on his hypnotic lyricism and pure poignancy that entraps the reader. Blame it on his story of self-conflict and melancholy, of reflection and remorse, of truth and lies and anything that embeds itself within the fabric of a life marred by deceit. Blame it on the forthrightness of a narrator whose words you follow intently:\n\nI remember that life in that room seemed to be occurring beneath the sea. Time flowed past indifferently above us; hours and days had no meaning. In the beginning, our life together held a joy and amazement which was newborn every day. Beneath the joy, of course, was anguish and beneath the amazement was fear; but they did not work themselves to the beginning until our high beginning was aloes on our tongues.\n\nThe story starts in the present tense, with David (our narrator) reflecting on his life with Giovanni, his male lover. The story starts and you immediately sense that something has gone wrong, that you are at the cusp of what seems to be romantic tragedy, because David is embittered with remorse, regret and self-loathe: \"people are too various to be treated so lightly. I am too various to be trusted.\" And then the story veers to the past tense, when David tells us the story from Giovanni's Room, a setting that was once the center of his life. He feels responsible for Giovanni's fate (as he narrates Giovanni is in prison), and he feels responsible for breaking his fiancee's(Hella) heart. David has come a long way, from New York to Paris, to avoid the conflict taking place within him. He is a gay man who wants to have a wife and a family. He is a gay man who wants to be accepted by society. He is a motherless gay son who wants to be accepted by his father:\n\nA cavern opened in my mind, black, full of rumor, suggestion, of half-heard, half-forgotten, half-understood stories, full of dirty words. I thought I saw my future in that cavern. I was afraid. I could have cried, cried for shame and terror, cried for not understanding how this could have happened to me, how this could have happened in me.\n\nDavid's story of self-actualization is told in such a way that makes it relatable; to think of this vast world of ever-changing spectrum and to wonder wherein one can really find oneself. In this case, an American in Paris, a gay man in a conservative society, a young man figuring out his sexuality - the mistakes that accompany such awakenings. Reading this book, I was reminded of the sort of picture I yearned for in The Picture of Dorian Gray, and while the setting, mood, and even some themes are reminiscent of The American by Henry James, what Baldwin does better is introduce characters only as they move the story forward, as a result, you see these characters more clearly. I can only imagine why this masterly written novel did not get more publicity, but the answer I come up with saddens me, for this is a transcendent piece of art that seems to be one of Baldwin's more poignant pieces.\n\nWhen one begins to search for the crucial, the definitive moment, the moment which changed all others, one finds oneself pressing, in great pain, through a maze of false signals and abruptly locking doors."}, {"userName": "Donna Ho Shing", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31940761-donna-ho-shing", "userReview": "Here's what l shall do: buy all Baldwin's books, every single one and just read them all.

An American in Paris, David is escaping from the conventional expectations he feels from his father, and pretty much everyone else in greater society. In Paris, he feels freer to live and love more honestly. But even in Paris, he and Giovanni are trapped in a shabby room with sightless windows, lest anyone see them together. It is suffocating, dingy, and he longs desperately to get OUT of this room, away from his self-loathing, out where he can be 'normal'. Out, where his girlfriend Hella waits for him, with the potential for a traditional, acceptable life that has all the perfect shapes, and the appropriate pronouns. David doesn't realise that the suffocating closet he lives in has nothing whatsoever to do with Giovanni's room. His self-made prison goes with him like a shell on a turtle. It is always there, and is constructed completely from fear and repression. It is so much a part of David that it won't be removed. It will shield him from societal rejection, yes, but it also bars freedom, love, connection with another human, the ability for others to really know him.\n\"And no matter what I was doing, another me sat in my belly, absolutely cold with terror over the question of my life.\"\nThis little novella is tight, packed with claustrophobic doom. It has an American-in-Europe charm to it reminiscent of Highsmith's The Talented Mr. Ripley. It's evident from the first page that James Baldwin is a beautiful writer, who wrote about things that he knew about, personally. He faced awful disadvantages being not only a black man in mid-20th-century, but a black, gay man. And how interesting that he decided to write a book featuring two gay, white characters. By doing that, he aptly demonstrates that being a gay guy in 1956 was a hell that even racial privilege couldn't avoid.There's some odd, (dare I say) misogynistic-y stuff floating around here, which is a bit disappointing. Lines like this: \"Women are like water. They are tempting like that, and they can be that treacherous, and they can seem to be that bottomless, you know? - and they can be that shallow. And that dirty.\" I guess they can be, anyone can be tempting, treacherous, shallow and/or dirty. But women as a group? My disappointment was evened out somewhat by the character of Hella, who is intelligent, honest, and laments being dependent on a man. This book addresses the specifics of living and loving out loud, using the example of being homosexual in an unaccepting world. But I think it translates well in a general way to all those who live secretively, whatever that secret may be. It speaks to those whose identity is so private, they feel painful isolation, to those whose fear has grown out of proportion, their need to conceal overshadowing the potential for happiness. This is the great tragedy at the heart of this book, and for those who live this reality. \n\"...love him and let him love you.

I only heard of Baldwin a few years prior, via other GR friends' reviews of his books. I had his books on my TBR list, but they were there with six hundred other books ... Anyway, that documentary pushed me to seek some of his books. It didn't occur to me when watching the documentary that Baldwin was gay. The poor man, being black and gay, during a very reprehensible period in US history. Not only he had to fight against the white people, against the system because of his race, he had to hide and fight his own community's homophobia. No wonder he escaped to France for a while. Anyway, I had to remind myself that Giovanni's Room is not autobiographical, although it must have drawn inspiration from his personal experiences. I plan to read a bit more about Balwin and this novel.As I was reading Giovanni's Room I had to remind myself several times that the main character, David, an American in Paris, was a white man. David is in the closet and is ashamed by his one time encounter with a male friend. As the only child of a nice man, he feels it's his duty to be the \"right\" way. It's not only that, it's the 1950s and earlier, homosexuality is illegal. Paris though is more relaxed. While the cat was away, in this case, Hetta, David's fiancee, he has a dalliance with Giovanni, a beautiful and passionate Italian bartender, whom he met in a gay bar. The two have a passionate affair for a little while, even sharing Giovanni's small room. Giovanni's small, cluttered, dirty room is a metaphor of sorts for David's complex feelings, especially when he knows the time is approaching when he has to make a decision - to have a respectable life that includes a wife and kids or to give in to his preferences?It's important to remember that this was published in 1959. That's quite a feat in itself. The fact that it was written by a black man, way before the Civil movement, makes this novel even more significant.Baldwin's writing is beautifully lyrical and packaged tightly. You can sense the doubt and dread, the fear, the self-loathing. None of the male characters is likeable, that includes David himself.

Baldwin treats complex relationships with some warmth and no easy or comfortable answers. There is debate as to whether Baldwin is focussing on bisexuality, but you have to look at the context and the sense that the two main characters are on a journey of self discovery with varying degrees of acceptance.The two main protagonists are David and Giovanni. David is an American currently living in Paris. He has a girlfriend, also an American, who is spending some time in Spain. David goes out for a drink with a gay acquaintance and meets Giovanni who is working in a bar. A passionate affair ensues, focussed on the room where Giovanni lives and where David spends much of his time. This idyllic, but doomed state of affairs continues until David\u2019s girlfriend returns from Spain and decisions have to be made. Some of the novel is told in flashback and so the reader already knows the denouement; the point is the journey; the how. Considering this was written and set in the 1950s, it is a brave book with a clear battle between different value sets and a debate about what love is and isn\u2019t. I wonder whether like Death in Venice we are looking at the Apollo/Dionysius split. Giovanni representing the passionate and unreasoning: David representing Apollo, more reserved, cerebral with the repression of emotion and denial of feeling. David feels like almost a detached observer of his own life. He has a very brief sexual relationship with a girl he meets, knowing it means more to her and knowing that for him it means very little. He detaches himself and is at a distance from his involvement and there is no care or concern for the needs, wants and feeling of the other. David does this with all those he relates to. He cannot accept his own self and this makes him very dangerous and damaging to others. To an extent, all the characters settle for what they don\u2019t seem to be.You could say that love doesn\u2019t conquer all, but I\u2019m not sure this is really about love at all; apart from Giovanni, who is destroyed by betrayal. It is about society\u2019s expectations and about battles with identity and roles.

You're not the only one fumbling in the dark of man loves woman when each acts as so, you're not the only one realizing the gap between living and a life, you're not the first to discover that noose around your neck, so why the running? Why the fuss? You have a woman sacrificing her personhood on one of your shoulders, a man saving his existence on the other, and the thought of having them both defeats you utterly.If you had been the sole defeated, you may have been redeemed. But no. You ignored the truth of women surviving in the 1950's, you belittled the love of a man with far more than you to lose, and wrenched yourself out of your belovedly loathed dreamland in as bloody a manner as can be. Off you go, another quest for what you cannot bear to lose even to the undisclosed desires of your confusion and your shame, your manhood and your lust, the path your father led you and the lies with which you pave your way, off to a future of balancing over the gap.The worst of it is that you acted as anyone would. Better, maybe, worse, perhaps, but the reader knows the garrote of love and the lemming of its lifelines. There is no hating you without hating what they themselves commit in the name of affection and a socially acceptable relationship. Outside of that is only a sick sense of empathy and an even sicker sense of gratefulness that their personal hell is not your own.The rest, as we say, is history, and we are doomed to repeat it.\n\"Well then,\" he continued, \"as though with enough time and all that fearful energy and virtue you people have, everything will be settled, solved, put in its place. And when I say everything,\" he added, grimly, \"I mean all the serious, dreadful things, like pain and death and love, in which you Americans do not believe.\""}, {"userName": "Edward Lorn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8850418-edward-lorn", "userReview": "I'm disappointed. This book failed to deliver.Buh-buh-but E.! You gave it five stars. Shuddup, random person on the internet. You have no power here!But how can you give it five stars if it failed?Because it didn't make me gay.Oh, okay. Wait... what?It failed in making me gay. Homosexual, if you will. I do not, after having read this book, find men sexually attractive. Well, there is Johnny Depp. That's one pretty man. But, overall, I'm still, like, 99.9% straight. What the fuck are you talking about?Even after having read this book, I cannot, for the life of me, choose to be gay. And who wouldn't want to be gay. Come on! But it's not working. I mean, I should be just jonesing for penis right now, right?That's... that's not how it works...Here, random person possibly growing more and more offended with every line of this false dialogue (psssst... it's actually just me talking to myself. I bet you're shocked. I know, right!), let me explain.Whiny bitches from a bygone age found this book disgusting and felt sure that it would spread the GAY AGENDA! Some felt that, just by reading this novel, you'd fall into a nest of vipers and partake in lurid booty sex with all the mens. Just reading this text could brainwash you into needing the D, especially if you, yourself, were in possession of some D. What was the general public to do? I keep hearing how whiny and triggered this new generation is today, but when you look back at the \"good ol' days\", you find that previous generations were scared of fucking EVERYTHING: gay people and women and commies and invisible men. Hell, some of these fools are still scared of all that. And Tom Cruise forbid your skin color is darker than Elmer's glue. How can old folks have been so terrified of such silly misconceptions but then turn around and call today's young people \"too sensitive\"? Get the fuck outta here, ya muppets.Giovanni's Room is a terrific novel that follows an American in France. Our narrator's fiance has gone off to find herself and left him behind. He falls into a crowd of eccentrics, and ends up having a love affair with a man named Giovanni. The book is beautifully written. Some of the best, if not the best writing I've come across. Every word builds on the next, changing prose into music. Absolutely gorgeous. The level of word mastery on display here is awe inspiring. It will be a pleasure, I have no doubt, going through this author's back catalog. The only complaint I have are some ideas used that devalue women. Hella (the narrator's fiance) says at one point that all women are good for is getting pregnant and the narrator agrees. Giovanni and the narrator also have discussions on the uselessness of women. Didn't much care for that, but I couldn't tell if it was author intrusion or the character's personal beliefs. Because it wasn't obvious which, I'm not deducting any stars. Also, I call this guy \"the narrator\" because he's called both David and Butch in the book. Butch could've been a nickname, though, because only his father called him that. Unless I missed something. If that's the case, let me know in the comments. In summation: Giovanni's Room won't make you gay, but it will break your heart. If you love beautiful writing and touching stories, give it a try. My highest possible recommendation. Final Judgment: More James Baldwin now, please."}, {"userName": "Orsodimondo", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10490224-orsodimondo", "userReview": "IL CRIMINE DELL\u2019INNOCENZA Piccolo grande romanzo. Piccolo perch\u00e9 breve. Grande perch\u00e9 bello. Molto bello, e ricco, denso, stratificato.Erwin Blumenfeld.Trent\u2019anni dopo averlo scritto, Baldwin ne parlava cos\u00ec:La stanza di Giovanni \u00e8 su cosa succede se hai paura di amare un\u2019altra persona.E infatti un passo del romanzo recita:Qualcuno, disse Jacques, tuo padre o il mio, ci avrebbero dovuto dire che non sono mai state molte le persone morte d\u2019amore. Ma milioni di persone sono morte e stanno morendo ora dopo ora per mancanza d\u2019amore.A me per\u00f2 sembra che questa sia una spiegazione limitata. Non mi pare ci si possa rinchiudere unicamente nel territorio dei cosiddetti cuori d\u2019inverno.Come se Baldwin volesse distrarre da un altro tema, ancora pi\u00f9 centrale, non volesse sentirsi inchiodato a quell\u2019altro. Lui nero e omosessuale.Vivian Maier.Il tema centrale \u00e8 la diversit\u00e0. In questo caso, diversit\u00e0 di desiderio sessuale. Ancor pi\u00f9 chiaramente, \u00e8 l\u2019omosessualit\u00e0. Quella maschile.David, il protagonista del romanzo, rifiuta la sua omosessualit\u00e0 (o meglio, bisessualit\u00e0): perch\u00e9 per un uomo andare/amare un altro uomo era tab\u00f9. Proibito. In US era ancora reato.E probabilmente anche per questo David, e lo stesso Baldwin, si sono trasferiti nella ben pi\u00f9 liberale Parigi.Dove, comunque, nel 1956, rimaneva qualcosa al limite.Stavo tremando. Pensai: se non apro subito la porta ed esco da qui sono perduto. Ma sapevo che non sarei riuscito ad aprire la porta, sapevo che era troppo tardi; presto sarebbe stato troppo tardi per fare qualsiasi cosa se non gemere. Mi attiro a s\u00e9, mettendosi nelle mie braccia come se volesse darsi a me affinch\u00e9 lo prendessi in braccio, e lentamente mi trascin\u00f2 con s\u00e9 su quel letto. Ogni singola parte di me urlava no!, ma la totalit\u00e0 sospir\u00f2 s\u00ec.La diversit\u00e0 di razza viene omessa, tutti i protagonisti sono bianchi. Ma si rispecchia in parte nella diversit\u00e0 di classe: Giovanni \u00e8 un contadino, per giunta italiano, e per giunta meridionale \u2013 esserne attratti ma anche disprezzarlo era parte della stessa reazione, del suo effetto. Ed \u00e8 proprio lui che paga per tutti.David, il protagonista americano, sufficientemente abbiente da poter vivere all\u2019estero senza lavorare, e senza neppure dover cercare lavoro, senza far null\u2019altro che passare il tempo, \u00e8 sicuramente di tutt\u2019altra classe. E pu\u00f2 permettersi di disprezzare Giovanni perch\u00e9 non cerca lavoro con abbastanza determinazione.Fa parte della magia di Baldwin, e di questo magnifico romanzo cult, il mettere in scena solo personaggi squallidi: tutti, dal primo all\u2019ultimo, quale pi\u00f9, quale meno, nessuno suscita ammirazione, identificazione - ma tutti sono umani pi\u00f9 che umani, tutti stimolano empatia, tutti suscitano emozione e pensiero.Il documentario del 2016 diretto da Raoul Peck dedicato al romanzo di Baldwin rimasto incompleto \u2018Remember This House\u2019. Peck, di Haiti, \u00e8 l\u2019autore di quello che secondo me \u00e8 il miglior film sul genocidio del Rwanda, \u2018Sometimes in April\u2019.La stanza \u00e8 quella di Giovanni, piccola disordinata caotica sporca asfissiante. Ma da un\u2019altra stanza muove e ritorna il racconto: quella presa in affitto a St Paul de Vence da David e Hella, la sua promessa sposa, per scappare da Parigi, per allontanarsi da Giovanni, credendo di ritrovare se stessi. Ma David rimane solo, Hella torna a casa in US, si lascia David alle spalle. Non si sposeranno.E qui, forse, ha davvero ragione Baldwin, \u201cLa stanza di Giovanni\u201d \u00e8 su cosa succede se hai paura di amare un\u2019altra persona: perch\u00e9 per David anche con Hella non funziona, l\u2019amore \u00e8 autoimposto fino a che non si pu\u00f2 pi\u00f9 andare oltre, e il gioco \u00e8 smascherato, il velo cade, e si rimane soli. Soli come David in quella stanza, davanti alla finestra: al di l\u00e0, il cielo che s\u2019avvolge di tramonto, e poi sera, e poi notte \u2013 al di qua, il suo riflesso sul vetro, immagine sbiadita di s\u00e9 che lo scava, lo spinge a ricordare, pensare, sentirsi in colpa. Raccontare.Un\u2019immagine dal film dell\u2019ottimo Robert Gu\u00e9diguain \u2018\u00c0 la place du coeur\u2019, 1998, tratto dal romanzo di Baldwin \u2018If Beale Street Could Talk\u2019, che sembra sar\u00e0 presto nuovamente portato sullo schermo, questa volta dal premio Oscar Barry Jenkins.Ricordo che la vita, in quella stanza, sembrava svolgersi al di sotto della superficie del mare. Il tempo scorreva indifferente sopra di noi, le ore e i giorni non avevano significato. All\u2019inizio la vita insieme racchiudeva una gioia e uno stupore che erano nuovi ogni giorno. Al di sotto della gioia, naturalmente, c\u2019era angoscia, e sotto lo stupore, paura; ma non si fecero strada in noi finch\u00e9 l\u2019iniziale euforia non divenne come aloe sulla lingua. A quel punto l\u2019angoscia e la paura erano diventate le superfici sulle quali slittavamo e scivolavamo, perdendo l\u2019equilibrio, la dignit\u00e0 e l\u2019orgoglio. Il volto di Giovanni, che avevo memorizzato tante mattine, pomeriggi e notti, si indur\u00ec davanti ai miei occhi, inizi\u00f2 a cedere in punti segreti, inizi\u00f2 a incrinarsi. La luce nei suoi occhi divent\u00f2 un bagliore, la fronte ampia e bella inizi\u00f2 a lasciar intravedere il teschio al di sotto. Le labbra sensuali si rivolsero all\u2019interno, assorbite dal dolore che gli sgorgava dal cuore. Divenne il volto di uno sconosciuto \u2013 o forse guardarlo mi faceva sentire cos\u00ec in colpa che speravo fosse il volto di uno sconosciuto. Tutto il mio sforzo di memorizzazione non mi aveva preparato per la metamorfosi che la memoria aveva contribuito a provocare.Non molto dopo la pubblicazione di questo romanzo, Miles Davis era in tourn\u00e9e a Parigi. Boris Vian lo mise in contatto con Louis Malle che cercava le musiche per il suo nuovo film \u201cAscensore per il patibolo\u201d: Miles e i suoi musicisti improvvisarono una colonna sonora indimenticabile guardando le scene del film.

Love this man."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "This is a tragedy of failed love in post-war Paris, featuring a protagonist as hard to judge as Camus' \"The Stranger.\" The narrator, David, is a young man on an extended stay from the U.S. on parental funds, ostensibly to develop his writing skills, but in reality to play. A transient gay fling with an impoverished, artistic Bohemian leads to an idyllic cohabitation while his fianc\u00e9 travels in the East. You know it didn\u2019t last from the beginning of the book, but as the affair proceeds, you feel the delicious wonder of their love that is so liberating, you want it to last forever. Where so many travel tales open you to the adventure of exploring new worlds, this book sets the benchmark for a story of creating a world inside a room with the universe of two people. But then such a wrenching you are bound for. There is no focus on race in this tale, but the need for gays to \"pass\" as straight is revealed to be as much a corrupting a force as blacks considering passing as white not so long ago. And the phenomenon of internalized racism has its close parallel with the self\u2019s importation of society\u2019s disgust with same sex relations over much of history. I am always surprised when I learn of people who \u201cdiscover\u201d they are gay after long periods of living as straight. In this story I get some of such a reality when I learn how David has succeeded in erasing his early sexual experience with Joey at 13, a love discarded in a mental closet. First love is such a powerful theme in literature, but see if this little excerpt with Joey doesn\u2019t get some special power and rank over other accounts from Baldwin\u2019s skill and from the incident being so forbidden at the time:Joey raised his head as I lowered mine and we kissed, as it were by accident. Then, for the first time in my life, I was really aware of another person\u2019s body, of another person\u2019s smell. We had our arms around each other. It was like holding in my hand some rare, exhausted, nearly doomed bird which I ad miraculously happened to find. I was very frightened, I was sure he was frightened too, and we shut our eyes. To remember it so clearly, so painfully tonight tells me I never for an instant truly forgotten it. I feel in myself now a faint, dreadful stirring of what so overwhelmingly stirred in me then, great thirsty eat, and trembling, and tenderness so painful I thought my heart would burst. But out of this astounding, intolerable pain came joy, we have each other joy that night. It seemed, then, that a lifetime would not be long enough for me to act with Joey the act of love.And see if there isn\u2019t something immortal here, something akin to the literary equivalent of a first climb of Everest:It was borne in on me: But Joey is a boy.. I saw suddenly the power in his thighs, in his arms, and in his loosely curled fists. The power and the promise and the mystery of that body made me suddenly afraid. The body suddenly seemed the black opening of a cavern in which I would be tortured till madness came, in which I would lose my manhood. Precisely, I wanted to know that mystery and feel that power and have that promise fulfilled through me. The sweat on my back grew cold. I grew ashamed. The very bed, in its sweet disorder, testified to vileness. I wondered what Joey\u2019s mother would say when she saw the sheets. Then I thought of my father, who had no one in the world but me, my mother having died when I was little. A cavern opened in my mind, black, full of rumor, suggestion, of half-heard, half-forgotten, half-understood stories, full of dirty words. I thought I saw my future in that cavern. I was afraid. I could have cried, cried for shame and terror, cried for not understanding how this could have happened to me, how this could have happened in me.But all that is just background to the story here, but critical background. Once a person feels compelled to live a lie, some of one\u2019s humanity inevitably gets eroded. The consequences of the moral choices and lies that David tells to Giovanni and to his future wife led me to some hateful responses, struggling all the while to find the forgiveness he was surely due. Much has changed since this was written, and much has not. There is still a frontier for anyone trying to chart the course of a bisexual identity, for, as explored recently in John Irving\u2019s wonderful \u201cIn One Person\u201d, they find themselves rejected or mistrusted by most gays and straights alike."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "In James Baldwin\u2019s words:They said I was a Negro writer and I would reach a very special audience. . . . And I would be dead if I alienated that audience. That, in effect, nobody would accept that book\u2014coming from me. . . . My agent told me to burn it\u2026. [the publishers] told me, \u2018This new book will ruin your career, \u2026 and we won\u2019t publish this book as a favor to you.\u2019 Fair enough, James Baldwin wanted to avoid being pigeonholed as a black writer. So made his protagonist here white. So here we have a black writer presenting a gay love story about white people. And this book was published in the mid fifties. I mean, wow. That\u2019s fearless. That\u2019s reckless. If you look at the constellation of five star reviews and general critical opinion Giovanni\u2019s Room is a resounding success. I can see why \u2013 this is a novel about a (white) American guy in Paris who\u2019s proposed marriage to a woman who\u2019s gone off for a few weeks to think about it (she has her issues too) and in the meantime he\u2019s swept giddily into a love affair with a very handsome Italian waiter, with whom he ends up living, in the famous room, whilst horrifiedly waiting for The Fianc\u00e9e to return, at which point he has to figure out what to do. Giovanni has wonderful pecs but can that justify a life of skulking and self-loathing and gradually turning into a porky middle aged fairy which is what, apparently, your fate is if you\u2019re a gay man? Because according to our first person narrator, Americans are like this, French people are like that, men are like this, women are like that (he and his pals generalize like crazy), and gay men are either like this or like that, there\u2019s nothing in between. So gay men are either middle aged, flabby wealthy fairies (his word) or \u201cknife-thin\u201d waiters and rent boys. One or the other. So many generalisations about so many people amidst this intense prose. Baldwin\u2019s great control of place and atmosphere and melodramatic breathlessness pretty much successfully rushes you past all this dubious sexual politics which hardly any reviews mention. This book therefore gets like a million points for being a gay love story and exposing some gay men\u2019s strong desire to stay in the closet and (I think) in the end saying that if you deny your own nature you\u2019ll be left with less than nothing. But jeez, you could pull all kinds of quotes from here which gay-bashers would just love. It was really uncomfortable reading at times, for a whole number of reasons.

Why do we even read straight romances? So boring!Giovanni's Room is a perfect novel. Clear and merciless and focused. Okay, and screamingly melodramatic, but I've never had a problem with melodrama. And it contains an amazing straight sex scene - one of those rare ones that exist for a reason. It's a nightmare of a scene.\"You play it safe long enough,\" says an older gay man to the closeted David, \"and you'll end up trapped in your own dirty body, forever and forever and forever - like me.\" It's an awful warning. This is 1956, and it's just barely possible that David could have lived more or less publicly as a gay man - Ginsberg was doing it - but it would have taken a lot of courage. Maybe not as much as it took for Baldwin, who was also black.

With a sharp, probing imagination, James Baldwin's now-classic narrative delves into the mystery of loving and creates a moving, highly controversial story of death and passion that reveals the unspoken complexities of the human heart.", "title": "Giovanni's Room", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17288631-giovanni-s-room", "average": 4.22, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1377632064l/17288631.jpg", "reviews": 2775, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10427.James_Baldwin", "name": "James Baldwin"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Classics", "Lgbt", "Glbt", "Novels"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17288631-giovanni-s-room", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15998979-giovanni-s-room", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/828503.Giovanni_s_Room", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/527433.Giovanni_s_Room", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1072197.Giovanni_s_Room", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38462.Giovanni_s_Room", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/828507.Giovanni_s_Room", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/828508.Giovanni_s_Room", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733998-giovanni-s-room", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17714095-la-stanza-di-giovanni", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38514475", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/828504.Giovanni_s_Room", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17143.Go_Tell_It_on_the_Mountain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/464260.The_Fire_Next_Time", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/410810.Notes_of_a_Native_Son", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38474.Another_Country", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38463.If_Beale_Street_Could_Talk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
