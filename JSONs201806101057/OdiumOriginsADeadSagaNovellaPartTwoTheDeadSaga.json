Well, these beginnings were kind of dark, some even before they were faced with the apocalypse. Imagine just hanging around the carnival, then seeing the girl of your dreams, then saving her life, then seeing her die. Or how about the abused wife, who has made excuses for her husband for a little too long. A husband who shows just how little he cares when the chips fall. Gives new meaning to the phrase \u201cI can\u2019t wait until you are a zombie\u201d. And what about Karma, is she really a blonde, and why does everyone underestimate the blonde? All this and more for your reading pleasure. I guess it is enough to hold me over until the next installment of Odium.  So this bundle of fun is served up in usual Claire Riley style. With a little bit of giggle factor, and a lot of things you just did not quite see coming. Oh yeah, and all the blood and gore you can stomach. You get to keep guessing about how everyone gets together, but you can see some of the correlations in this book. I love how you get to see what makes everyone develop into the person they are, and how it happened. Ms. Riley does not just get to think up her backstory to each of her characters, she gets to blow it up and put it on the big screen of your mind for you.  While this is meant to be the origins of some of the characters of Odium Origins II, this can be a stand alone book as you do not need to have read any of the Odium series to understand anything. If this is your first venture in to Claire Riley\u2019s books, I think it will encourage you to read more."}, {"userName": "Eli Constant", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16763100-eli-constant", "userReview": "Wicked-good counterpart to Riley's Odium Series. One of my pet peeves when reading a full-length novel is lack of backstory. I'm a fan of characters, realistic ticks, traits, the 'ugly' side of a person, the 'attractive' aspects of a person. Riley does a bang-up job of keeping her characters real within Odium 1 & 2 (the full length series books), but what she does within the Origins books is something I find often lacking in a lot of novels, especially in this genre (i.e. horror/zombies/apoc.). She gives us the 'why' behind the characters- what turned them into 'crazies' or 'victims' or 'fighters'. Don't go into this novella thinking you're going to get some happy-go-lucky drivel that you'd feed your toddler for noontime snack. This is unattractive humanity at its very basest, but within that daily horror is levity, relief, and 'beating the odds'. There are enough good 'feels' to counteract the 'I want to punch that character's face in', but not so many instances of levity that you'll come away smiling with warm happy thoughts. More than likely, if you come away smiling, it'll be because a complete jerk got his just rewards. Now that is worth buying a book for. All in all, I feel this second installment in Riley's Origins novellas to be right up there with some of her best work. It keeps you reading- I would have finished in a matter of hours had 'real' life not knocked on my proverbial mental door."}, {"userName": "Melanie Marsh", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8058065-melanie-marsh", "userReview": "Once again, Claire C. Riley has blown me away with her ability to make me actually FEEL while reading. It would be different, I suppose, if she were writing in a more dramatic type genre, but no. She writes HORROR! I\u2019m not used to feeling so emotional while reading a Horror book. It\u2019s a surprisingly pleasant feeling to be honest.In this installment, we learn the back-stories of Matthew, Susan, Max, and Anne and Dean. These characters have each been through Hell and we learn a small portion of who the are in the Dead Saga, though not nearly enough. I can\u2019t help but feel sorry for them each for different reason. I want to hug every single one of them and then cook dinner for them! You can tell they are mostly all good people at heart, so it\u2019s extra hard to read about bad things happening to good people. On thing about Claire\u2019s word choices is that she makes you WANT to get to know them better. In Odium Origins 2, the intensity is almost overwhelming, but absolutely in a good way. It\u2019s so intense that you can\u2019t help but feel the character\u2019s emotions as they are experiencing the zombie apocalypse. Confusion, panic, fear, sorrow and eventually hope. You can feel the confusion and fear when everything first goes down, and the disbelief when they finally realize it\u2019s a nightmare come true. When they get angry that the world has come to this, you can feel their desire to destroy that which has caused them such pain. Every swing of a bat or machete is felt with such strength and intensity you can see the blood splatter it causes. You can feel when the character\u2019s weapon sinks into a skull. When a character dies, there is such sorrow at losing one of the few who have not yet been turned into zombies; and eventually the hope that someday either they will encounter those who they haven\u2019t been able to locate, or the hope of being able to successfully destroy the \u201cthings\u201d that their loved ones have become.I seriously love this book. I love the characters as well as the feeling that Claire puts into them. She really knows how to bring them to life in ways I have never encountered before. She is very obviously growing as an author. While her first few books were also really good, you can see the progression in her talent as she releases more and more stories for us to devour like a zombie with a plate full of brains.I would recommend this book to everyone. If they were to tell me they haven\u2019t yet read The Dead Saga or the Obsession series, I would insist they pick them both up right away. The Dead Saga books is still one of the only zombie series that I think has enough going on to set it apart from the run of the mill survivor stories we get in most zombie apocalypse books. Claire\u2019s books are anything but ordinary, but I guess you will just have to find out how when you read the stories yourself!"}, {"userName": "San", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17586355-san", "userReview": "I was given an ARC in return for an honest and fair review.Odium Origins II is yet another great book from within the Odium Saga/World. In this book we get the backstory to a number of characters that were in the background in Odium II. Theses stories bring us back to the very beginning of the apocalypse. And show the perspective from the eyes of these individuals.Odium Origins II deals with more then just the horror of the apocalypse, it deals with issues within the lives of these individuals before the apocalypse. Some of which is heart wrenchingly sad. The characters are bold and strong, whereas others are the lowest of the low (scum of the earth). The author Claire has managed to capture these characteristics to aplomb. Where you are really rooting for some of the characters and with others you'd kill them there and then if you could.The world is dark, horrific and disturbing. Yet it keeps you hooked to the last page. Every story shows humans at their very best and worst. A brilliant read and a must for zombie horror fans.The Odium universe just got bigger and better! I highly recommend this...Bring on Odium III"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29054422-jessica", "userReview": "Maaan oh man. I got sucked right into this one. I lovelovelove this second foray into the Odium Origin stories. This group is all about the underdog. The put-upon, beaten-down, looks-stupid-so-its-a-fact, doormats. Claire C Riley has done a splendidly gross group of stories here with the perfect set of surprises in each story. I won't rehash each plot, because I'm sure someone else will, but if you like come-from-behinds, zombies, and blondes you will love this novella.(As an aside, and I'm not sure why, but after I finished this, Simple Minds' Don't You Forget about Me was stuck in my brain) Thank you Claire C Riley."}, {"userName": "Susan Pigott", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21108291-susan-pigott", "userReview": "I was given an ARC for a fair and honest review.WOW! I think this was the most intense reading for me. I found myself clinching my fist, not breathing, laughing and crying, all at the same time. Claire's characters are so real, that the reader becomes one of them. After reading Origins, I actually looked outside to see if the apocalypse had started. I like Origins because you get to know some background on characters from Odium. I strongly recommend this book and any and all of her other stories too!"}, {"userName": "Halima Rahman", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11369249-halima-rahman", "userReview": "I love these glimpses Claire C Riley gives us into a characters past & \"the beginning\". I always love reading about who, what, why & where the characters are when the apocalypse kicks off & how their journey takes them from living everyday life into survival mode - crossing paths with Nina & gang. The stand-out feature of this book is in the action-based pacing. The narrative is once again brilliant & I could really feel the characters going through the stages of emotions. As with the rest of the Odium series - the Origins part 2 also includes the essential zombie story elements-- monsters trying to eat people, people becoming monsters, tragic loss, Relationships, love & hate & world full of tragedy and disaster. I definitely recommend this one. It's a great read! The entire odium series has got me hooked - every character & every story - the author has a way of making her readers live the apocalypse. I'm really looking forward to Odium III - especially after Riley left me exhausted, breathless & speechless in Odium II & in Odium origins part 2."}, {"userName": "Maribel Zamora", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12712945-maribel-zamora", "userReview": "I almost love to hate reading The Odium novellas because it makes the characters that much more real. The glimpses we get into their past, of where they were when it all started, of who and what they lost hurts. I mean why would it matter there\u2019re alive right? Well it does, it matters greatly. For if we weren\u2019t privy to them we would just see the person they are now, who they became after the apocalypse, almost a shell of who they once were. We wouldn\u2019t have gotten to see the hopeless romantic- who got the chance to look into the eyes of quite possibly his true love, a woman that was set free from one to hell to be thrust into another- but more or less on HER own terms, an underestimated blonde- although unfortunate circumstances got to show what she is actually made of, and the highs and lows your everyday teenager goes through. Each character in OOII has shown \u2013 you can be your own HERO.Eeeeeek Can\u2019t wait for book3 #Mikey"}, {"userName": "Becky Stephens", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24779079-becky-stephens", "userReview": "Odium Origins Part Two contains more back stories from the Odium Dead Saga. Returning to the start of the zombie apocalypse, we see it from various points of view whose lives are completely different. It is those differences that define how the individuals react to the start of the apocalypse in very different ways.While I was rooting for the demise of certain heinous characters - and not by zombie - others I just felt sorry for, and worry about their mental health in the months and years to come. My favorite characters were, by far, Max and Constance. These two kick-ass partners will survive no matter what.I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review.

Personally I love this series. Odium origins 2 covers four character stories of characters from odium the dead saga. All four stories are amazing. I am so thankful that Claire is doing these origin stories to get to know all these supporting characters. Claire has a fan for life with me and I am so looking forward to the next chapter of the odium saga and what is in store for all these characters down the road. On a side note thank you Claire for making Mathew an awesome character :)"}, {"userName": "Kelli Mcelreath", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32390572-kelli-mcelreath", "userReview": "I have read all in this series and I am a mega fan.

His friend Darrell who is equally non-Bimbo-ish saves them from the ride. This first story was actually called HOUSE OF GLASS. After losing his new girl and his old friend he meets up with a lady named Jessica and they driveaway in the Prius.The second story,THE BOOK NERD, is about Susan and her abusive husband Ken who are having a business dinner with Ken's colleague Phil. Susan has been a secret prepper for many years because she is an avid BookReader of any type of genre.In BIG GIRLS DON'T CRY, The Hero (Reluctant?) is a quick thinking office gal, Max, who wears kitten heels and saves most of the office from zombies, even the catty, jealous woman, because she believes us girls need to stick together. She is joined by her girlfriend Constance and they drive off into the sunset to find their dog Chi-Chi.The Friends, Anne and Dean, in THE GHOST TOWN give a great background story of a strange town that Mikey and Nina travel through in another Odium book.
