Ok so this was a good try at an interesting story, but instead it seemed far fetched and over done . So first things first , it needs an editor ! The dialog is too choppy, the characters are possessive, (what man's eyes change color and size and say things like \"you're mine, I possess you\"?) whiny and repetitive, the author seemed to be shooting for a 50 shades Esq book but instead writes a knock off only. Travis doesn't know if he's a rock star or a big wig CEO and is all mysterious and has perverted love for a kid. The overused nicknames of Chief, Mischief and Trav were on my last nerve . Mischief tried to be a mature woman in kinky situations and then became child like referring to her parents as momma and daddy and acting all jealous throwing tantrums like a preteen girl. So annoying! One of the biggest issues for me was not understanding what demographic we were in . There were so many British slang words and terms used , it was very distracting . Then the next paragraph everyone sounded like country bumpkins! Where the heck were they in this book ?? This book was disappointing period. A rushed, underdeveloped story that needs an editor desperately. I don't even know if I care enough to read the next book after that lame cliff hanger ."}, {"userName": "Spoiler Whore-Momoa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3531683-spoiler-whore-momoa", "userReview": "This is the type of book that you shouldn't like but end up really liking it for some reason. Some will hate it, some will not finish it, and some will love it. I really liked it. It has all the elements that I love to read in a book. Childhood crushes, secret romances, angst, crazy best friend, drama, family dynamics, laughter, heartbreak and smokin' sex. And the cliffhanger. Oh yes, there's a mother fucking helluva cliffhanger...I don't have to feel this pain anymore...Nuff saidBack to the story. Violet or Mischief is the daughter of Chief, President of the Phoenix MC. She thought she knew the lifestyle but she was sheltered in a way. Her dad shows her the \"dark\" side to the club cause he doesn't want her in any of the darkness it can bring. This darkness is Travis Phoenix. He was Mischief's best friend and crush growing up. He felt the same way but didn't do anything about it due to the age difference of six years. He left town without a word to Violet and she was left heartbroken. Travis became a famous rock star but left that life to come back. Chief sees him as a son but he knows he has a dark side and secrets, just like he does. And when those secrets come out, Mischief is left devastated.Travis and Violet's chemistry is hot and their connection is solid...until a secret comes knocking on the door. Literally.Some might say that Mischief acted immature or spoiled. I didn't see that. She was daddy's favorite and it never clicked on why Chief called her that. When she finds out about the other sister, I get why she was mad. You only know so much in your life and then for it to suddenly shake up with secrets and lies even by omission can cause you to say hurtful things. I got that. Favorite line/moments:\"I am hungry.\" \"Pregnant already?\"\"Up your ass you fool; I haven't slept with him.\"\"I don't deserve you.\"\"I will be the judge of that.\"Chief narrows his eyes at me. \"Calling me father, you wound me girl.\"\"Do you ever regret coming back?\"\"No, I only regret one thing in my life Mischief and that was leaving in the first place.\"The next book will definitely be on my top TBR stack.

There is 7 years difference between Violet and Travis but she has loved him her whole life. Her Dad, Chief is the President of a motor cycle club. The legacy of being President should of gone to Travis but he doesn\u2019t want it. He wanted to be a Rockstar. So he took off to New York without saying goodbye to Mischief, or Chief or anyone\u2026 Just left\u2026 Vi was heartbroken. 4 years later he comes back. He doesn\u2019t say why hes back, just that he wanted too. He doesn\u2019t say why he left, just that he had too. But now that\u2019s he\u2019s back, he wants Violet now that she is all grown up.

I don\u2019t think I would have finished the book if it wasn\u2019t a very short read and I hate not finishing a book I have started. In Phoenix Rockstar you will meet Violet and Travis Phoenix\u2026 Violet was madly in love with Travis when she was a young teenage girl. Travis is older than her by six years and played with her emotions in my opinion. Travis took off without saying goodbye and became a famous rock star and never said another word to Violet again. Now Violet is 21 and Travis comes back into her life turning it all around.That sounds great doesn\u2019t it? I think the author could have kept the story at just that and not thrown in every clich\u00e9 possible and it would have been a great book. Violet\u2019s, which by the way is the most annoying and immature 21 year-old character in history!! Anyway Violet\u2019s father is the leader in a bike gang who Travis also belongs in... Well sort of\u2026 it\u2019s all confusing. Travis is also a CEO of a company, so basically Travis is a Rock Star, a CEO, and a biker\u2026. It was so unbelievable! Violet\u2019s father is crazy over protective and does not approve of her relationship with Travis even though her father is also Travis\u2019s friend\u2026 I totally did not understand that at all. Her father also discussed way TMI with his daughter in the room, yuck! Add in jealous ex lovers, secrets\u2026 I could go on and on\u2026One thing I did enjoy was Violet\u2019s best friend Reagan, she had some funny moments. I also enjoyed the flash back scenes of Travis and Violet before Travis left and became famous. I thought the age difference was weird but the scenes were sweet.I just couldn\u2019t over look all the unnecessary extra story lines when just Travis returning to Violet four years later would have worked really well. The story ends with a cliff hanger, I am really not sure if I want to continue on with the series or not. The book did have potential.

What a nice surprise though to find a new Author and a great story!Jenny: Yes, when we\u2019re looking for new reads and words \u201crock star, bikers and steam\u201d pop up...well, we just had to pick this one up didn't we? This story did keep my interest, but it also managed to frustrate me at times and that darn cliff-hanger!! It has ensured I will be checking out book 2. I\u2019m far too nosy not to!Gitte: We sure did! Okay let me start by saying that I loved the setting in this story, we had bikers, a bad boy tattooed rock star, hot passion and suspense. I hate cliff-hangers but if you are going to finish a story like this in style then that one rocked!! Yeah it has a cliff-hanger but book#2 is out in March!Jenny: At least we don\u2019t have to wait too long for the next one! You\u2019re so right Gitte, this had everything. Hot Rock Star, Travis. The Phoenix MC Club. Secrets, lies, steamy sex and drama, drama and wow, more drama and suspense! I did have a few issues with the book which prevented me from giving it a higher rating, but I have to say I couldn't put it down.Gitte: What did I love? I loved the flashbacks; I thought they were excellent in connecting the reader with the main characters. I loved Travis, our hero, I thought he was lush! He was complicated, sure, he was an arse at times, definitely, but he loved with a fierce passion and he went for what he wanted. He left our heroine Violet, became a rock star, a ceo of a music label and returned to her years later after breaking her heart. He is six years older than her and the motorcycle club\u2019s rule states he cannot be with the Chief\u2019s daughter \u2018Mischief\u2019 which just happens to be Violet. They share a past, one passionate kiss and a heart.\u201cSometimes all darkness needs is a little of the right kinda light. I am your light Mischief.\u201dI loved the suspense and the darkness that was in this story. It kept me hooked that\u2019s for sure.Jenny: I enjoyed the flashbacks and felt they allowed the reader to grasp a better understanding of the intensity and history of Travis and Violet\u2019s (Mischief) relationship. We were able to see glimpses and gain a feeling for the depth to which their lives were destined to always include each other.I loved Travis too! He has secrets. Well, to be honest, they all did. It was secret city in this book and they all seemed to unravel all at once! Travis left Violet without so much as a backyard glance when she was a teenager, breaking her heart and leaving her always wondering why he left the way he did. They have history, and a connection an intensity that neither could fight, even breaking MC Club rules to ensure that happens. Their feelings are just too deep rooted to ignore. Travis and Mischief certainly do share an intense and extremely passionate relationship that\u2019s for sure. Travis definitely won me over!\u201cI want you Mischief, and will not stop until you are mine\u201d TravisI loved some of the light-hearted moments in this book too, especially the Dirty Dancing scene! Oh I love Travis!Gitte: Did I love our heroine Violet. No\u2026but I did like her. She had a conflicting personality. At times she came across as independent, mature and clued up. At other times she was na\u00efve, very childish for her age and her behaviour frustrated me. Oh and the whining\u2026pack it in already!! Violet has loved Travis ever since she was a kid. The feared but respected Chief of the motorcycle club took Travis in and him and Violet forged a very strong bond from the outset. The passion, intensity and the drama these two characters share is extremely full on!Jenny: Violet drove me to despair! Just when I would start to like her she would throw a hissy fit and I\u2019d be back to disliking her and wanting to slap her! She appeared to have everyone wrapped around her finger and used that to her advantage, at times being quite cruel and hurtful to those around her. She would show a maturity beyond her years one minute and an immaturity the next that would have me rolling my eyes at her. She was definitely night and day throughout this book. I don\u2019t think I really warmed to her to be honest but I'm looking forward to her developing as a character in the next book.Gitte: Okay, what didn't I love\u2026well Violet but I have already explained why. I thought there was too much drama between Violet and Travis, again this down to her strange conflicting personality. I really didn't like the Australian slang used in this story. If you are a foreign Author to the country setting you write about, you need to make sure you use the appropriate language and slang. It doesn't work otherwise and makes the story less authentic. Authenticity is very important in my opinion. I also have to highlight that there were editing issues in this story. Miss-spelled words e.g. Travis was wearing a black skirt just to name one.Jenny: I agree. Violet frustrated me to distraction and the drama towards the end of the book was just full on. It seemed to all spill at once and I nearly got whiplash flicking from person to person, secret to secret. I have to agree wholeheartedly on the authenticity. Being Australian myself, the first thing I noticed were the the \u201cAustralianisms\u201d in this book, I picked them up immediately and it distracted me along the way. Language must indeed be authentic to allow the reader to fully immerse themselves in the character and the setting and as the slang used in this book was not in keeping with the particular setting of the story it, and at times caused me to be removed from the story at hand.Oh yes, the errors. There were a few, but the skirt one threw me!Our text conversation:Jenny: WTF? My hot, alpha rock god Travis wears a skirt to work?\u201dGitte: Shirt, Jenny. It should be shirt. Jenny: thank god!Gitte: Overall I really enjoyed this story despite how much it frustrated me at times and I cannot wait to read book #2!!Jenny: I did enjoy this story. This book did have an \u201cUndeniable\u201d feel about it. It definitely held my interest and I will be picking up book two in the series because I\u2019m dying to know where this story goes from here.!!!!"}, {"userName": "Breezy *Lover of all things Alpha Male*", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15256205-breezy-lover-of-all-things-alpha-male", "userReview": "This book is Erotica.

You have been warned - ENJOY!!Violet has been raised in a world with bikers, rough men and separated parents. The only savior in her world, was her love for Travis, her best friend. They grew up together, creating a hopeless friendship against all odds. Then he left, with no goodbye, no explanation.Travis went on and became a successful rockstar, Violet moved on and thought she was finally over it. Then Travis returns and tugs on her heart strings all over again. She finds it hard to say no, she is different now\u2026she isn\u2019t the girl he once adored; dark things have happened to her. What if she isn\u2019t what he believes he wants so badly?Come on Travis and Violet\u2019s journey of love, heartache and all the things in between.First of all this is the first novel I have read by Bec Botefuhr. And to be honest it wasn\u2019t what I was expecting. This is both good and bad. Let me explain.First you need to know that Violet is a bit of a pampered biker princess. She has a mother and father who are way too involved in her life. At 21 she is still explaining where she is going, who she is seeing, and still living at home with mom. She stays with her dad on weekends and generally acts like a spoiled brat. She throws tantrums, rebels constantly, and somehow seems like a teenager and not a grown adult. Even when she begs her father to treat her like an adult, it comes off childish.Travis is a rockstar. He is possessive, needy, and intense. ALL OF THE TIME. That being said, he is also charming and sweet. But like all the men in Violet\u2019s life, he is hiding something important. The weirdest part about reading this book for me, was that I connected to Travis more than I did Violet.There are secrets all over this book. No one seems to know how to tell the truth, and everyone is sorry once they are found out. There really are tons of things to get to in this story. Which probably explains why Botefuhr\u2019s writing seems so rushed. I felt like I was suffering whiplash in some sections of the book. She went from 3 different locations and situations in a page and a half. All that being said, she left the story in such a way that I HAVE to know what happened. I loved that ending. I loved that it wasn\u2019t a HEA. I loved the angst throughout the book. I didn\u2019t love being rushed. I wanted to feel a connection to Violet and I didn\u2019t. I would recommend the book based on the ending itself. But you have to be patient, because there isn\u2019t a whole lot of depth to our main characters. Hopefully when I read the second book I will find out more. ~B~"}, {"userName": "*Call Me By Your Name*", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3329111-call-me-by-your-name", "userReview": "Rockstar, Biker Gang, Danger, Deceit, Unrequited Love...Did I say deceit?Revised - 3 StarsBefore I start, I just want to say...I love Ed Freaking Sheeran!

I can take violence and angst and nasty things, but throw in deception and I get completely squicked out. This is the reason why it got 4 stars.

I thought the authors simplistic writing and her Aussie terminology was endearing though. EDIT:Having pondered this a while longer...now I am pissed off even more! Even Violets mother lied to her about the reason for leaving her father. When Violet asks him if he ever wanted any more children, he \"flinched\" and told her she was the only one for him. LIAR!Violet hears Travis say \"Amber\" in his sleep and when she asks him who Amber is, her says \"I don't know\". Then he says he's not ready to talk about it. What is he not ready to talk about? That while he was kissing her, when she was 17 and Annabelle was watching, Annabelle was already pregnant with HIS baby and he knew? WTF?Oh and don't forget, Travis has that secret room in his house.And what about Janice? Okay...Travis has been with Annabelle for 4 years and left her to move back home, but he had a relationship with Janice for a year, a year before he left NY. So he was cheating on Annabelle for a year and went back to her? And he continues to have Janice work for him? What an asshole! I am about to lower my rating, but I'm holding myself back!

It combined 2 of my favorite sub-genres: rock stars and motorcycle clubs; had my favorite kind of hero--the uber alpha, super sexy dirty talker; and had the erotic romance that I love, so I was really, REALLY looking forward to diving right in. Once I started reading, however, I was a little put off. It was a pretty good read with the erotic romance between a majorly hot rock star and the daughter of the president of a motorcycle club with some angst and a bit of suspense mixed in. And I enjoyed the progression of the storyline, the grittiness of the motorcycle club and the majorly smokin' hotness of the romance; however...at times, the storyline read like a series of checkpoints--it just didn't always flow smoothly. There were also some pretty obvious editing errors (\"to\" instead of \"too\" several times and other blatant misspellings). Another thing that I felt interfered with the flow of the storyline was the underuse of contractions. Instead of sounding like real dialogue, it often sounded stiff--almost like robots (or Jeanie from I Dream of Jeanie) were talking. With all this in mind, why am I still giving this 3-1/2 stars? Because the storyline was interesting enough to make me want to keep reading despite the stuff that bugged me, and I enjoyed the characters well enough (especially the sexy, possessive, dirty-talking, alpha rocker hero) to overlook the other stuff as much as possible. If the storyline had been more polished and properly edited, it would have most likely garnered 4-1/2 or maybe even 5 stars from me. And because I did enjoy the storyline and the characters as much as I did, I'm really looking forward to the 2nd book in the series!

Then here is Violet (Mischief) who has to be one of the most annoying characters ever. She is constantly crying, over everything. Then she is mad and just runs off every time she is upset. The way that Violet acts and talks is really immature. I kept thinking how childish she is throughout the book. I mean really do twenty one year old really act like that? Then there is Travis who quite frankly has me confused. I liked him but I didn't love him. Hes all about how much he love Violet and yet it didn't feel real at all.

I must admit, I enjoyed it TONS more than I thought I would! Don\u2019t get me wrong, we all know I love books on Hot, Sexy, Rocker Guys \u2013 but because of that, I have some expectations.Violet, or Mischief, grew up in a world that most of us will never experience, except through television. She grew up as a bikers daughter. From the reading, I have learned that sometimes, it\u2019s not all it is cracked up to be. She had to deal with a broken family. Being from one, I know what that is like. Then, that one faithful nights events that changed her life forever. The icing on her crappy life cake? The fact that her best friend and the man who held her heart, just up and left without so much as a goodbye. Making the best of her situations, Violet has lived the life the only way she FELT she DESERVED to.. Reserved and without much fun. I can fully understand why she is the way that she is. Though it make suck sometimes and she comes across in ways that make you want to smack her, there is a reason to her insanity. It\u2019s so hard to LIVE when your very being is telling you that you don\u2019t DESERVE to.Travis \u2013 holy freaking SHEESH! I could sit here and go on and on with describing this man to you, but I will just sum it up instead. SEXY, GORGEOUS, Bad Boy Attitude, Lead Singer of a Rock Band and all things Alpha. He can totally invade my thoughts anytime he wants to! Moving away was the very thing Travis needed to get in life in order. Now he is back and determined to win the girl he was never able to forget. The best friend that he left behind 4 years ago. Travis reminds me of the very thing I love about Alpha Males. He\u2019s strong, compassionate, determined, cocky \u2013 but with subtle arrogance, and the very thing needed to keep the pages sizzling.We watch as Travis and Violet remember just why the two of them were so close before he left. We also get to watch as they face the very life challenges that made them who they are today and are the very things that could keep them apart. But what happens when you FINALLY find EXACTLY what it is you are looking for? The one thing that finally gives your life meaning? Only to find that life has decided to throw your past in your face && that past is the very thing that could ruin your future\u2026Oh! I feel that I must mention that the lovely skin sizzling sex scenes were rather yummy to read! I only had a couple of downfalls with this novel. The first being the typos. Normally, I try to overlook them, because \u2013 let\u2019s face it, no one is perfect. This time though, it was the simple words that got me. The other thing was the cliffhanger. SERIOUSLY! Who does that? I am DYING to know what happens! Book 2 \u2013 Heart Song \u2013 in March cannot come fast enough! Phoenix Rockstar is a read for those who like romance, mixed with bad boy rockers and a side of sexy!"}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/130621-tara", "userReview": "I am not sure about this book. I think part of it was that fact that I lived in LA for ten years and the incorrect location information really seemed to bother me a bit.The story started well, but then it was all over the place and so choppy that is was not easy to follow. Bikers, assistant in a law firm, rock star, CEO.....lots of stories going on and it was really choppy.I have to say I was also not a big fan of the all deceitfulness that took place and came out in one short book, I'll leave it at that to not spoil it for anyone.It did end on quite a cliffhanger, I'll give you that.My curiosity will most likely get the best of me and I'll read the next in the series, but my hope is that it gets better from here."}, {"userName": "~Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14139338-kimberly", "userReview": "NOOOOOOO!!!
