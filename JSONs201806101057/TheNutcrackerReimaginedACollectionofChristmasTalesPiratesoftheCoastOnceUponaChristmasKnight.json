Yo lo he echado de menos.No creo que a estas historias se les pueda llamar tal. Ni siquiera historias cortas. Son m\u00e1s bien un compendio de cap\u00edtulos cortados que nos llevan al HEA de cada pareja sin pasar por la casilla de salida. Y a veces sin incluso argumento. \nThe Mercenary\u00b4s Bride por Claire Delacroix.\n Hay m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n en la descripci\u00f3n de la historia que en la historia en s\u00ed. El h\u00e9roe casi muere en Espa\u00f1a mientras intenta hacer fortuna para volver a reclamar a la hija de su se\u00f1or. Cuando vuelve, hecho unos zorros, ayuda a su se\u00f1or a deshacerse del clan enemigo. Su se\u00f1or le busca curro en el castillo de al lado y le otorga la mano de su hija. Fin.A eso lo llamo yo llegar y besar el santo.\nRealm of Angels por Kathryn Le Veque.\n Otro h\u00e9roe que le dice a la hero\u00edna que se va a casar con ella y desaparece para hacer fortuna. Y ya puestos, se casa con una princesa francesa. Y en un incendio sufre quemaduras horribles y desfigurantes en su rostro. Y vuelve a ver a su amada y se pone a trabajar en el castillo, de carnicero. Y una noche que, cubierto de harapos y maloliente, sirve la cena en los salones del castillo,va y salva a la hero\u00edna del villano y \u00e9sta, al reconocerlo, cae rendida a sus pies y tienen el benepl\u00e1cito de sus padres, porque, t\u00fa sabes, es amor verdadero.\nOnce Upon a Christmas Night por Barbara Devlin.\n Un h\u00e9roe entregadito a su amor por la hero\u00edna que espera a que el padre de \u00e9sta est\u00e9 en dificultades econ\u00f3micas para aceptar la mano de su hija como pago por su ayuda. Aunque \u00e9l lo hubiese hecho gratis. Y despu\u00e9s de un mont\u00f3n de malentendidos: Fin.\nRodrick the Bold por Suzan Tisdale.\n La hero\u00edna es secuestrada por el clan enemigo, vendida de unos a otros, maltratada hasta casi la muerte y violada repetidamente. Llega el h\u00e9roe y es todo risitas y morderse la lengua para no re\u00edr\u2026.(\u00bf\u00bf??) Un poco de no soy lo bastante bueno para el otro y HEA.\nPrelude to the Highlander\u00b4s Gift por Eliza Knight.\n Agradecer a la autora que en la introducci\u00f3n nos advierta que m\u00e1s que una historia estos ser\u00e1n los primeros cap\u00edtulos de su nueva novela, que ser\u00e1 publicada en 2018.A\u00fan as\u00ed, no me parece justo tener que pagar por el avance de una novela.No la le\u00ed.\nBrash: Frederick por Hildie McQueen.\n He le\u00eddo el primer cap\u00edtulo y uno de los \u00faltimos en los que aparece Clara (la hermana del h\u00e9roe).En el primer cap\u00edtulo el h\u00e9roe pone una Glock (pistola para los no entendidos) en la cabeza del futuro marido de su hermana el d\u00eda antes de su boda. Y el t\u00edo se queja de que, y cito, the a**hole left his sister high and dry at the church on her wedding day.Sip.Sin comentarios.En el \u00faltimo que le\u00ed, Clara (la hermana) perdona a su futuro marido por huir (\u00bf\u00bf??) y se casa con \u00e9l, porque es el amor de su vida.A\u00fan estoy flipando.Este h\u00e9roe s\u00ed que es una joyita, y lo dem\u00e1s son tonter\u00edas.Y campana y se acab\u00f3. Ya no puedo m\u00e1s. Aqu\u00ed lo dejo. Hay 4 historias m\u00e1s que dejo sin leer.***I wasn\u00b4t going to review this book but, seeing that there are only 5 and 4 stars reviews here, I think maybe a warning would be welcome. I would have appreciated it.I wouldn\u00b4t call these stories stories per se, not even short stories. They are a compendium of chapters which led us to their HEA\u00b4s without a proper beginning and sometimes neither a plot. \nThe Mercenary\u00b4s Bride by Claire Delacroix.\n The blurb is richer than the story.The hero almost died in Spain when he was improving his wealth so he could go back and ask for the hand of his chief\u00b4s daughter.When he returned, he was a complete wreck, but helped his ex-master to overcome an enemy clan attack. Grateful, his ex-chief gives him a job in a nearby castle and his daughter\u00b4s hand.My, my, beginner\u00b4s luck so much?\nRealm of Angels by Kathryn Le Veque.\n Again a hero who tells the heroine he is going to marry her, but on the way to ask her father, he stumble into a French princess and decide to let the princess help him to improve his wealth (again) but then, he end up marrying the princess(and that\u00b4s all we know about it). But before the wedding, he is involved in a fire and suffers burns and disfigurements in his face. So the princess dismiss him and he comes back to see his love (from afar) and work as a butcher in her father\u00b4s castle. And one night he, who is dirty and smelly and is wearing drags, is serving the family in the dining room (well, you know, its medieval equivalent which right now I don\u00b4t remember\u2026) and saves the heroine from the villain and she recognizes him and she gives him her heart with her parents approval, because you know, it\u00b4s true love.\nOnce Upon a Christmas Night by Barbara Devlin.\n The hero is totally in love with the heroine but wait until her father asks him for help (he is in financial trouble) and accepts the heroine\u00b4s hand as payment for the help. Although he would have done it for free. And after lots of misunderstandings: the HEA.\nRodrick the Bold by Suzan Tisdale.\n The heroine is kidnapped, sold, beaten almost to death and repeatedly raped by the enemy clan and, as soon as the hero shows, she has to bit her lip to not laugh, she giggle\u2026(\u00bf\u00bf??) Add a bit of I\u00b4m not good enough for you and Ta-daaah!: The End. *sigh*\nPrelude to the Highlander\u00b4s Gift by Eliza Knight.\n Thanks to the author for the warning that this one is not a story. It\u00b4s a teaser from her next book (available in 2018)\u2026\u2026. Are you kidding me?I don\u00b4t think is fair I have to pay for a teaser (without knowing it)I didn\u00b4t read it.\nBrash: Frederick by Hildie McQueen.\n I had read the first chapter and the next with Clara (the hero\u00b4s sister) in it.In the first chapter, the hero holds a Glock (a gun, for those who aren\u00b4t acquainted with the word) against the head of Clara\u00b4s fianc\u00e9 the day before their wedding. The fianc\u00e9 fled in terror and the hero thinks, and I quote:  the a**hole left his sister high and dry at the church on her wedding day.Yep.No comment.In the next chapter in which Clara appears, she forgives her fianc\u00e9 for running away and marries him because he is the love of her life (and vice versa)This hero is a gem\u2026I throw in the towel, people.You win.There are four more stories I\u00b4m not going to read."}, {"userName": "Becca", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15807787-becca", "userReview": "I read only the installment from Claire Delacroix. My review is below.Claire Delacroix is a favorite author of mine so I am always pleased when she has a new release. The novella in this collection is the start of a new series called the Brides of Inverfyre. For those who have read and enjoyed the Kinfairlie and Ravensmuir series, you will also like this, especially because the Hawk and Aileen have a strong presence in this tale.Mhairi is a headstrong middle child. She is unlike most women and prefers to hunt, handle a knife, and find her own way. Her determination leads her to spending forbidden time learning the art of the blade with her father's chief of defense, Quentin. For his defiance of the laird, Quentin is expelled from the keep. Determined to one day reclaim Mhairi for his own, he leaves to find his fortune, only to lose everything and return to Inverfyre years later maimed and disgraced but set on keeping a promise to Mhairi. The romance in this story focuses more on reclaiming a lost love. Mhairi and Quentin fell in love seven years ago off the page and the story starts upon Quentin's return. It is a quick paced adventure that tells the tale of Quentin's redemption and Mhairi's acceptance rather than how they met. For this short format, I think this choice was a good one. I liked how the two leads trusted each other and were devoted to one another. However, I would like to note that these two do not get to spend a lot of page time together. The adventure and intrigue (there is an enemy clan out for vengeance) is good, but most of the romance is off page. I think the purpose of this novella is to immerse you in the holding of the Hawk, remind you of Aileen and the Hawk and their devotion to each other, and set the stage for all of the stories to come.I read this story in two sittings and enjoyed once again returning to Inverfyre. A lot of time is spent with all of the family members so it does help if you've read some of Delacroix's other series (Kinfairlie and Ravensmuir). It isn't heavy on the romance but it does have a great story and lays a sold groundwork for more stories to come.I received this book from the author with no expectation of review and all thoughts are my own.4 stars."}, {"userName": "Maria ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32775059-maria", "userReview": "What a great way to start the upcoming holidays! I thoroughly enjoyed all of the reimagined Nutcracker stories. Each tale is reimagined by each author. What a unique and successful concept.My favorite story of the collection was Realms of Angel's by Kathryn Le Veque. The hero, Rhogan de Garr, makes an impression on you immediately. An excellent Knight who is a second son who must make his own way.Unfortunately, choices are made which lead to a completely different outcome to what he predicted, while hurting the girl of his heart.Lady Juliana de Nerra demonstrates what it is to love with your whole heart no matter what.Each story was so unique by the following authors:1. The Mercenaries Bride - Claire Delacroix2. Realm of Angels - Kathryn Le Veque3. Once Upon a Christmas Knight - Barbara Devlin4. Rodrik the Bold - Suzan Tisdale5. Prelude to the Highlander's Gift - Eliza Knight6. Brash Frederick - Hilde McQueen7. Christmas at the End on Cloud Hill - Tina DeSalvo8. One Mystical Moment - Laura Landon9.

I began at the beginning and have been reading at my leisure. The Mercenary\u2019s Bride is the telling of a love, a love Mhairi held deep in her heart for a man ostracized from his clan, for daring to teach Mhairi, daughter of the clan how to use a crossbow and dagger, against specific commands from her da. This novella will be the first of a series author Claire Delacroix is starting. Kathryn Le Veque\u2019s Realm of Angels, unique in its presentation of the Mouse King, is a fantastic tale about a man who survived a fire, terribly scarred. His heart is wounded and seeks being close to a woman he loves, but carelessly let go six years ago for the lure of wealth and land. He works in the kitchen of her castle, masked to cover the hideousness of his face. This one is very touching and a testament that past errors can be overlooked when compared to the good wrought in the present.Once Upon a Christmas Knight by Barbara Devlin moves us to London, 1813. Scandal is the dominant power molding lives, but the strong can survive. Percival Henry Forester Howe receives the whiplash of untruths and ton gossip. He wishes he could have offered for Margaret Hogart, but it is no way to start a marriage \u2013 she, too, would be shunned by the ton. Just has his situation clears, he receives a visit from Margaret\u2019s father who\u2019s in a rather financial pickle, being swindle by a so-called investor. Percy is very good with his investments and has high standing among the influential. Margaret\u2019s father offers Margaret in marriage. Margaret is a rather shy woman, retiring, but plays the piano exquisitely. Can she be convinced to willingly marry Percy?Suzan Tisdale writes a brilliant tale titled Rodrick the Bold. Taking place in 1357, he makes the usual wish upon a star on Christmas Tide \u2013 \u201cI want naught more than a wife and bairns of me own. A family and home to call me own.\u201d With strange dreams plaguing him, does what they ask \u2013 seek out Muriel McFarland, daughter of a warrior who had past. Tisdale has me weeping for the plight of Muriel. She is poorly used by and man and wife who say her father had owed them money. She is to work it off. Her brother not there to protect her, she finds she\u2019s sold twice. Rodrick is her savior, but Rodrick can\u2019t figure out why he\u2019s spending so much time and money to find her for a man he should bother with.Mayhap I have lost me mind, he quietly mused. Here I am, running around the Isle looking for a lass I have never met....Why are ye doin\u2019 this to yerself? He had asked that question more than once in the past two days. Riskin\u2019 yer own neck fer a lass ye\u2019ve never met and fer a man who tried to kill ye.On a side note: Rodrick has a love-hate relationship with his horse, Caderyn. It is the humor breaking a very bad and dangerous situation. Lovely Quote: Two lost souls stood in front of a tiny window in a small room at an inn. One wishing to die, the other wanting desperately for her to live. Once cried a river of tears, the other offered up whatever he could to console her.Prelude to the Highlander\u2019s Gift, written by Eliza Knight, is quite humorous. Bella Sutherland, daughter of the Chieftain of the Sutherland Clan, must wed. Her father gives her no choice, other than one of the men at the ball they sponsored, must be her new husband. She had decided never to marry for she has a secret. Stumbling upon a conversation of some merit, a warrior has been denied marriage to Princess Elizabeth. It\u2019s because he is missing an arm, from battle. She\u2019s also heard he has other injuries. Bella seizes upon the moment and claims the warrior for herself. What is nice about this one, it\u2019s a prelude to The Highlander\u2019s Gift, releasing in 2018.The last one I\u2019ll speak on, although there are four more stories, is Brash: Frederick by Hildie McQueen. Remember, readers, this is 677 pages long! This one takes place in Montana. Kennedy Brooks is short of help, in fact desperate for it. Rick Edwards, in search for his love-struck sister\u2019s groom, happens upon Kennedy\u2019s farm; she\u2019s thinking about selling and he just might be interested. Kennedy has just come off a divorce, her ex found cheating. Animals play a large part in this contemporary romance. This is a story where hero and heroine go after what they want!Bottom Line: Lovely collection of happy ever afters ready to be read and enjoyed as you purchase your tickets to see The Nutcracker Suite ballet this season."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9656026-anna", "userReview": "The Nutcracker What do you get when you get when the story plot is to re imagine a well loved story that has been told at every Christmas time, The Nutcracker Suite?Why you fine not one fabulous author as Katharine le Veques but eleven wonderful authors writing their version of The Nutcracker reimagined.These wonderful authors Katharine le Veques, Barbara Devlin, Eliza Knight, Hilde MC Queen, Suzan Tizdale, Tina Desalvo, Layna Pimentel Laura Landon and Emma Prince take you back to different times different ways and different Nutcracker stories that you are flying through each one before you know it.Each author has you falling in love with their character's lives their situations and their path to happiness.Each author tells how they reimagined the Nutcracker would be about and each leaves you with wanting more of the character's and especially more of their individual style of writing.

I was delighted to discover that Ms. LeVeque expounded upon a character I was personally drawn to from a previous novel. As a child, Rhogan fostered in the home of Val de Nerra where he met Juliana, Val's daughter. After he became a knight, Rhogan left to fight in one of his King's campaigns against France. While Rhogan was known as an excellent knight, he continued to be haunted by the fact that he was not going to inherit lands and wealth like his friends. Concerned by his lack of fortune, Rhogan, was reluctantly swayed by the promise of land and wealth. Rhodan needed to learn that people are not always valued by the sum of their material wealth or their appearance, but by their character, what is in their heart, and how their respond to others. It was a very pleasant experience for me as I read Kathryn LeVeque's rendition of an old, well know, Christmas tale. She did a masterful job of seamlessly entwining it with a very touching medieval love story to provide the reader with a message of Hope and Everlasting Love. I believe anyone who is lucky enough to read this anthology will greatly enjoy their experience."}, {"userName": "Tracy D.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29396860-tracy-d", "userReview": "Great Collection of NovellasEach story in The Nutcracker Reimagined is a creative twist on the original tale by E.T.A. Hoffman or Alexander Dumas.I read this book specifically for the story written by Kathryn Le Veque, \"The Realm of Angels,\" as she is one of my favorite authors. Her take on The Nutcracker is about the Mouse King who actually ends up getting the girl, which is different than what happens in the original version. Kathryn has a talent at writing captivating and tender romances, great villains, and she does an excellent job of blending both into one character. However, in order for the Mouse King to get the girl, she had to create a scenario that evoked sympathy for him. Pretty hefty task, but I believe is done well. The person I felt the most sympathy for was the \"Clara character,\" Juliana. She's been in love with her knight since childhood, and on the very evening he promised to ask her father for permission to court her, he chooses greed, ambition, and a French Princess instead. Four years she holds onto her love for her knight. Even after hearing about his engagement to the princess. It's terribly sad, but is an HEA after all.Anyway, just this tale alone is worth the price of The Nutcracker Reimagined.

I loved the Scottish Highlands setting!Other stories I enjoyed included \"Rodrick the Bold,\" by Susan Tisdale, and \"Prelude to the Highlander's Gift,\" by Eliza Knight.

The stories run from the Scottish Highlands to Montana, from the 13th Century to modern day. All involve some aspect of the nutcracker story. Some are complex, others straightforward. I usually reserve holiday themed books for December, but that month got away from me. I just finished reading in early March. The authors I was familiar did not disappoint and I enjoyed discovering new authors."}], "description": "A MASTERPIECE OF HOLIDAY STORYTELLING... Imagine, if you will, that it is Christmas Eve. The candles are guttered, one by one, and a hush falls over the grand parlor. The children have gone to bed, and a tall, gloriously decorated Christmas tree looms in the shadows of the hearth\u2019s dying embers. Beside the tree a nutcracker stands guard, its broken jaw cradled in a kerchief tied about its head. All is quiet in this dark, peaceful scene until the long case clock chimes. Dulcet tones form a gentle symphony, and the parlor comes to life. Now, the magic happens. Lose yourself in The Nutcracker Reimagined, a collection of eleven Christmas tales based on the most treasured characters from the famous holiday ballet, The Nutcracker. Sugarplum fairies will dance in your head, as armies of mice and legions of dolls do battle, and a wounded nutcracker and his lady fair become the stuff of which legends are made. From Arabian dancers to living flowers and hosts of angels, enjoy these tales as reimagined characters from the beloved Christmas tradition find their own happily ever after. And as the clock\u2019s chimes signal the approaching sunrise, you\u2019ll awaken from these magical stories to discover it has all been a beautiful dream of a retold Christmas classic. ***** A limited edition collection!", "title": "The Nutcracker Reimagined: A Collection of Christmas Tales\n      \n          (Pirates of the Coast #5 Once Upon a Christmas Knight)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35716257-the-nutcracker-reimagined", "average": 4.28, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1500629901l/35716257.jpg", "reviews": 27, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5989639.Kathryn_Le_Veque", "name": "Kathryn Le Veque"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12694.Claire_Delacroix", "name": "Claire Delacroix"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6462331.Barbara_Devlin", "name": "Barbara Devlin"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2881569.Eliza_Knight", "name": "Eliza Knight"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5406631.Suzan_Tisdale", "name": "Suzan Tisdale"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4997442.Hildie_McQueen", "name": "Hildie McQueen"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8178167.Tina_DeSalvo", "name": "Tina DeSalvo"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/153887.Ellen_Dugan", "name": "Ellen Dugan"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4150415.Laura_Landon", "name": "Laura Landon"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6939073.Layna_Pimentel", "name": "Layna Pimentel"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8526876.Emma_Prince", "name": "Emma Prince"}], "type": ["Romance", "Holiday", "Anthologies", "Romance", "Short Stories"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35716257-the-nutcracker-reimagined", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17874968-the-wolfe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15717119-the-dark-lord", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21406157-serpent", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14288670-lespada", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15747554-the-legend"]}
