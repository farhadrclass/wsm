After all ending up in the same place for the most part, all of our favorites (well MY favorites anyway) return in book #2, this time searching for a way to survive in what is exponentially becoming the end of days. As the unexplained and utterly confusing virus waves through the country decimating city after city, our ragtag group of survivors decide that if they're able to win a Navy warship, they just might make it. Like a small floating city, it has everything they need - provisions, electricity, a hospital, etc. The only problem, like everything else, it's overrun by the dead, and they'll need to make sacrifices and fight like hell in order to survive.Slightly more zombie action driven than Omega Days (book #1) and more centrally storyline motivated (without constant shifts of POV between the different groups), there is tons of fabulously horrific gore, plenty of edge of your seat breath-holding moments, oodles of tragedy, action, suspense, and my favorite... the probing of the human psyche, which proves - unfortunately - that mankind may just be the worst monsters out there, especially when placed in a situation where morals are questionable, desperation abounds, and minds are easily lost. I really enjoyed book #1 of the series, but Ship of the Dead drew me in even deeper, establishing even stronger bonds with some of the remaining cast and desperately making me want to know what happens next in Drifters (book #3 coming in January). I know there have been mixed reviews with this series, but I really enjoy them, and I would totally recommend them for fans of zombie fiction. If you don't shy away from gore, utterly deplorable antagonists, and the darker side of reality, than take a chance with John L. Campbell and the OMEGA DAYS series. While not The Walking Dead, the books have a bit of that feel, and if you like the psychological side of TWD, I really do think you'll enjoy these books. Not everyone will agree with me, but take a chance and see for yourselves... :)"}, {"userName": "Lilyn G. | Sci-Fi & Scary", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33783014-lilyn-g-sci-fi-scary", "userReview": "RTC, but just as good as the first one.

I met John Campbell at one of the booths and he was giving awaythe fuirst novel in this series, Omega Days. The only problem was that his shipment had not arrived in time so he took peoples names and addresses and said he would send them out when he got the books. I came home and as the weeks went it slipped my mind. The book finally arrived and was even a signed copy. Call me simple, but that really impressed me. A few weeks went by and I finally got around to picking it up and reading it. I loved it and couldn't wait for the next one to come out. Solast week I'm standing at the library in the new book section when this book pops out. I totally fan girled out right in the library. I made enough rackett that people came around the stacks to see what was making all the noise. I looked really dorky, but screw it. Igrabbed it and brought it home and pretty much read it from front to cover all in one shot. Around 3 am is when I finished. It was so worth the lack of sleep. Once again, John L. Campbell produced a spectacular 2nd book in this series. The book is full of zombie goodness. The survivers from the first book find the USS Nimitz (An aircraft carrier) and proceed to rid the ship of the undead and take it for their own. The undead are really not the scariest issues they have to deal with. A few of their own people have designs on other things than just surviving. I don't want to give away any more info, just know that if you love a good zombie series than I recommend picking this up. The next installment is due out in January 2015. I will be patiently waiting."}, {"userName": "Randy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11522827-randy", "userReview": "I tried to like this book, really, I did, but it was so monotonously boring and formulaic that I found myself just dropping it to go watch clouds instead.

Und das beste, kein ewiglanges Vorwort was im ersten Teil passiert ist.In diesen B\u00fcchern hei\u00dfen die Zombies Drifter und sind auch recht flink zu Fuss. Aber das andere Problem ist Monition und Nahrungsmittel, also wie in jedem Zombiebuch.Ich liebe die Personen in den B\u00fcchern, jeder hat seine Geschichte und warum er wie auch handelt wird erkl\u00e4rt. Es sind nicht Oberfl\u00e4chige Figuren und das finde ich gut da das Buch in Amerika bei Band 8 glaube ist, also kommt da noch einiges auf uns zu ;)Der Schreibstil ist fesselnd geschrieben und ich konnte es nicht aus der Hand legen.Zombieb\u00fccher gehen eigentlich immer solange sie nicht zu kitschig werden, den dann ist so ein Buch echt Mist.Ich freue mich auf Band 3 und hoffe er kommt schnell zu uns nach Deutschland.Pluspunkte:- Tolle Charaktere mit einer Geschichte.- Um die Orte wurde sich Gedanken gemacht und man hat das Gef\u00fchl mit dabei zu seinMinuspunkte:-Cover:- Es zeigt das Schiff um welches es sich in diesem Band dreht.http://buechertraumzeit.blogspot.de/2..."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34949907-ryan", "userReview": "This review is void of any major spoilers.John L. Campbell is a great author. The setting of this story takes place on an aircraft carrier the USS NIMITZ and based on how elaborate and detailed he got with the setting you can tell he really did his research for this one. Throughout the story there were zero, and I mean no typographical or grammatical errors of any kind. What Campbell excelled at in the previous book was character development where he seamlessly flows from one individual narrative to the next always keeping you intrigued by the morbid and suspenseful plot.The same characters that were introduced from the first book make a reappearance as well as a couple new ones. He ties up all of the loose ends from the cliff hanger of the prior book and injects some new perspectives of the world along with it. Fairly quickly you find out what life is like on the open sea, the whereabouts of Maxie, the outcome of Skye's heroic/foolish standoff at the belltower and how all the characters behave around one another now that their individual narratives all get tied together.Towards the beginning of the book Campbell uses a discussion amongst the survivors to lay down the \"rules\" of the infection which is just like in the TV series The Walking Dead, where bites guarantee death and reanimation but even if you die through other means you still come back a zombie. Also introduced in this book is something known as \"the slow burn\" which opens up a very interesting look at the inner workings of the virus itself.Overall I did enjoy this book and plan to continue reading the series. The characters have unique and original personalities and very fleshed out back stories. My personal favorite characters are Skye for her inner fortitude, Carney for being the most well rounded character and (although a minor character) Maya for her spunk. I won't say who but Campbell does kill off some of his major Point of View characters from the prior book and from mybperspective it is nice knowing that even the major characters are not guaranteed to be safe. I mentioned it earlier but the knowledge of the environment is a real strong quality of Campbell's. The garb of the zombies based on their locations, the layout of the ship, the geographical history of San Francisco itself, all of these are taken into consideration. And most importantly, while the zombies are the major threat in the series, this book introduces multiple human antagonists just to prove that even in this world some individuals are more dangerous when they are alive as opposed to being zombified.That being said there were a few things I didn't like so much in this installment of the series one of them being how Campbell tips his hand through blatantly obvious foreshadowing as to when a particular minor character is about to meet their demise. You really aren't surprised when a majority of the minor characters get killed off because Campbell points out their mistakes literally right before they get killed off. Another pitfall is the luck aspect. Something you expect the characters to struggle to overcome and the answer to their prayers gets dropped directly into their laps gets to be a puzzling aspect of the story. Lastly on the downside of Campbell's writing is how clich\u00e9 and corny some of the verbal exchanges are and towards the end some of the relationships that evolve into romantic ones are absolutely cringeworthy. My biggest critique of Mr. Campbell is that he is a well-researched and skilled writer but he should leave out the sappiness in his writings. Especially when every romantic relationship feels identical to one another but with different character names.The people I would recommend this book to would be the zombie-fanatics, anyone who enjoys the revolving character perspective narrative or if you're like me and are most intrigued by the moral dilemmas the characters find themselves in."}, {"userName": "Colleen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1125315-colleen", "userReview": "So all our heroes & villains from the previous book meet up on the docks of San Francisco with a relentless horde of zombies after them. Time for some nautical zombie action! (See Dead Sea and Black Tide Rising, among others.) As usual in zombie books, people want to gravitate to the usual safe places--sea, the arctic, some godforsaken forest--just once I'd like to see someone take over a Costco and just live there for a decade or two, which seems like the safer option, but anyways...Some Spoilers I guess...Across their perilous stronghold in some warehouse next to one of most populated cities in America is a partially destroyed aircraft carrier, so it's time to fight their way through its darkened hull and make that be their safe haven. Naturally, things go wrong with this cunning plan for most of them, and cherry on top is bringing along the lunatic televangelist & meth head for this assault. One thing that gets me is why not send a 2-3 person scouting team to check out the ship first? Points to them for at least trying to lure some of the topside zombies off the carrier, but why not just open the doorway they go through and just make a ton of noise for hours? Lure as many zombies overboard as they can? And then go in? Why are the folks keeping watch in all zombie books/films so terrible at it? You think your senses would be honed with fear and it's not like the living dead have ninja stealth on their side. I guess it wouldn't be as suspenseful otherwise and the book is pretty action packed since the setting is a ship packed with thousands of undead, a rapist, and a madman chasing after armageddon. I immediately started the third one."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17730391-stephanie", "userReview": "Ship of the Dead is the second book in John L. Campbell's Omega Days Series. As a fan of the first novel, I knew it would be difficult to top. However, Campbell creates a fantastic urban warfare setting with this followup. The suspense is nonstop and you will certainly find yourself holding your breath on more than one occasion. Ship of the Dead takes place on an infested aircraft carrier, the only option left for our survivors. As we watch the survivors attempt to take back this ship from the dead, we are just sitting on pins and needles for something awful to happen with every turn of the page. The characters in this novel return from Omega Days and we see who the true leaders are and are introduced to some vile personalities that many managed to hide in the first novel. This novel took on a darker tone and we experience the loss of some beloved characters. However, others step up and you find yourself rooting for some unlikely characters. John L. Campbell has a talent for writing thrilling urban horror scenes. Campbell is the perfect author for fans of The Walking Dead and other novels and comics at the top of their game in the zombie genre. He does not leave out the important fact that the dead are not the only threat in this hellish new world. The ending of Ship of the Dead is one that will leave you with your jaw on the floor and running for the next book! This is every zombie lovers ideal series!http://novelideareviews.blogspot.com/..."}, {"userName": "Chase", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46479720-chase", "userReview": "I thought the \"Ship of Dead\" by John Campbell was very entertaining and action packed. Most of the book takes place in San Francisco on a ship called the U.S.S. Nimitz where the characters are trying to find a way to control the ship and escape San Francisco. There are many problems the characters face throughout the book, like how the ship has thousands of zombies on it and the tasks they have to complete in order to start the ship. The author brings in more characters which adds more depth in the book by talking about each of the new characters backstories. Most of the story is about the characters trying to get the ship working again. I loved the page turning action and the books high intensity. Book one of Omega Days which I have already read was very good but I liked the \"Ship of the Dead better\" because of the intensity and action. I often got confused and forgetting about some characters in the first book because the author kept adding more and more people to the story. One thing I really like about this book is that the zombies and starting the ship aren't the only problems, its also the characters. Different characters throughout the book change and turn insane which also adds more depth and intensity into the book. I would recommend this book to mature readers and to people who love post-apocalyptic fiction. I would rate this book 10/10 stars."}, {"userName": "Richard Kearney", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2462027-richard-kearney", "userReview": "The second book in John Campbell's \"Omega Days\" series picks up where the first novel left off, with the main characters reaching the San Francisco harbor, on the run from a deadly horde of zombies, and seeking a safe refuge. What they find is a promising sanctuary in the form of an aircraft carrier - the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) - that came to a halt about a mile from the coast after the zombie virus struck its crew. The only problem is that the carrier is infested with zombies that stand between the survivors and their amply supplied safe haven. Campbell continues to develop the wide array of characters he introduced in the first novel, while also bringing in a few important new ones. Most of the plot is taken up with the survivors' plan to capture the ship and eliminate the zombies lurking throughout it, an adventure Campbell depicts with considerable tension, keeping the reader engaged. And along the way some major scores are settled, as some of the major characters prove to be as much of a menace as the zombies. While Campbell provides enough background detail on the characters for this novel to stand alone, it really should be read in conjunction with the first novel (Omega Days) for maximum enjoyment."}, {"userName": "Kristin Taggart", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16051353-kristin-taggart", "userReview": "(Description nicked from B&N.com.)\u201cFather Xavier Church never wanted to be a leader.
