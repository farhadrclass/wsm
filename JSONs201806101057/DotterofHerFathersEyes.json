Both vanguard and old guard are sacrificed in the collision of ideals. And sometimes the casualties aren't just metaphor and social construct. Sometimes there are literal casualties\u2014human ones. Dotter of Her Father's Eyes relates the struggles of two such human sacrifices in the battle of ideological paradigm shift. Both Lucia (James Joyce's only daughter) and Mary Talbot (this book's scribe) were real combatants in a war they may not have even been quite aware they were embroiled in. Certainly, they recognized the fact of the skirmishes that framed their lives' choices and developments, but could they have known from the inside just how monumental the transformation being wrought upon the kingdom of Western Civilization was? (It's possible, of course, but the young are rarely the most aware of the larger struggles that govern the architecture of their lives.)Ideas are important and have value because people believe in them.1 And not just in the sense of casual assent. Not like how I believe that Antarctica exists but can't be bothered to shape my life around the fact. Discovering Antarctica isn't actually there or is there but underwater or is a flying continent\u2014or probably really anything I could discover about Antarctica won't do much to ruffle the feathers of my life. If someone brings it up in conversation, the entire summation of my response would accurately be distilled to: Huh. Interesting. If, however, you and forty otherwise intelligent people tried to seriously convince me and society that having kids was actually evil, my reaction would almost certainly be more visceral (depending on how real I believed the threat to my way of life to be). At the least, there might be defensiveness and some frustration. As the threat escalates, tolerances strain and violence or unhappy legislation (for one or both sides) may erupt. In her biographical and autobiographical work, Mary Talbot (aided visually by husband and illustrator Bryan Talbot) confronts the struggle of society to lurch into the era of modernity and beyond. It's unclear whose story Talbot is more interested in (or if she even has a preference), but she introduces an inclusio whereby she in the current day finds an old ID card belonging to her now-deceased father. Inside the framing device Talbot pursues two narratives: one concerning her own formative years at the hand of her father James Atherton, a well-regarded Joycean scholar, and the other charting the development of James Joyce's own daughter Lucia and the relationship he had with her. Neither relationship is a thing of joy and beauty, but one suspects that if both girls were born to the same fathers a century later, the absence of certain social constriction might have allowed for happy endings all the way around.As delineated by Talbot, both Mary's and Lucia's lives are welled up under the pervasive irony of being the children of bastions of modernism who cannot see clear to apply modernist principles to their own patriarchal relationships. Dotter lays special emphasis on the rallying cry of the paradigm movement: \"How modern!\" Everyone around both Mary and Lucia are caught up in the transformation of culture\u2014of the evolution of the stilted, errant, grossly conservative pre-modern society into the glorious fortress of progressive social democracy found in the modern utopia. It's a period of hope and change. And each of these two fathers are in some sense heralds or ambassadors or representatives of this new civilization.The irony of course is that in the cold darkness of their hearts' hearts, they are still staunch defenders of the Old Ways\u2014hopeless, helpless relics who will unconsciously stop at nothing to crush the Spirit of the Age in its most immediately tangible bastion. They will carelessly destroy their children (or perhaps die trying), unaware that in so doing they make mockery of those values they pretend to hold dearest to their hearts. Mary's father Atherton will do so by his direct actions built of disdain and outright dismissiveness of his daughter. Joyce, on the other hand, will combat his own values through a negligence in policing he and his wife's failure to recognize Lucia as something more than their provincial understanding of the female being will allow. Compared to Atherton, Joyce appears a doting father\u2014one who truly loves and admires his daughter but simply doesn't have the grounding by which to combat either his wife's vindictiveness or to understand the place of the female in modern applications. Perhaps he was more a doer than a thinker. Atherton, however, cannot claim such excuses (as if excuses ever really exonerate one human from destroying another)\u2014he is a scholar, a thinker, and devoted to considering the ramifications of Joyce's body of work. Surely some mote of the new paradigm, some willingness to apprehend the world through inventive, fresh structures ought to have asserted itself through his studies. Still, as poor, blind humans, our penchant for adhering to comfortability and ritual and the tried-if-not-true will ever hold power over our sense of reason\u2014so while tragic and ironic, neither Joyce's nor Atherton's failures are particularly surprising.\"Sad life. Sad life,\" to quote a certain wise but immolated horse.2As a work, Dotter of Her Father's Eyes is an enjoyable, thoughtful read. (Or at least as enjoyable as a non-fictional pair of tragedies can be.) Mary Talbot's script was at all times interesting for me\u2014even if I didn't necessarily understand the purpose of combining her own story with Lucia's. Though I described Dotter as an exploration of the irony of a particular conflict between ideology and praxis, that's a layer of interpretation that I read onto the story because I felt the need to draw out an overriding theme from the work. While the irony is there pretty unquestionably, it's unclear whether this is Talbot's primary aim with the narrative. When I first finished reading, I was frustrated with not being able to discern why Talbot may have tied her story to Lucia's beyond the simplistic connection constructed by Atherton being a primary scholar of Joyce's oeuvre. My wife felt a similar dissonance and we tried to suss out Talbot's point unsuccessfully. Perhaps it's there and obvious. Perhaps we were unqualified to discover it or perhaps our concentration was too divided by the conflict of late-night readings versus days filled with the stress of juggling earning an income against good, loving child-rearing. Perhaps we were just dense (momentarily or permanently). Or perhaps Talbot didn't quite succeed in tying together the threads of her purpose.Regardless, the book is good and worth a reader's time. Both Mary and Lucia lived in horrifying and exciting times. I can't imagine the struggle of mind and heart. From my position of genetic and historical privilege, I can't imagine being a thinking person burdened under such constraints. I'm grateful then to the Talbots for bringing this segment of the historical record to light and life, no matter how nauseating. _____________________Art NoteFor his part, Bryan Talbot is in stellar form. My only other intersection with his work is his celebrated \nTale of One Bad Rat\n. In the two decades since then, he's clearly honed his artistic sensibilities and as crisp as his vision was then, it's become something truly beautiful and evocative here. Talbot uses usually monochromatic palettes of washes to indicate narrative threads and imply mood and warmth and love and panic and everything else. I never felt any question as to what a scene was meant to display. I'd love to see more of Talbot's work, especially if along these lines._____________________Two Other Notes1) It only just occurs to me that Talbot introduces her story with the faerytale-esque: \nOnce upon a timeAnd long agoA King and QueenHad a daughterHer name wasMarushkaOr LuciaOr Lucy MariaOr Mray\nI suppose then it's possible that Mary Talbot's name is Lucy Maria (named for Lucia) but she that goes by Mary, giving a touch more connection between the two women and better justifying the dual-nature of the book?_____________________Footnotes1) Terry Gilliam played this to interesting effect in his Baron Munchausen. Gilliam focuses his narrative lens on the birth of the age of reason and represents his ideological combatants as individuals with fantastic powers. Throughout the adventure, Gilliam treats us to the blending of the literal and the ideological such that the conflict between the two is made more tangible. Really, I'm not sure that Baron Munchausen has much to do with Dotter, but I think we shouldn't probably miss any opportunity to remind ourselves of Gilliam's genius. Plus, isn't this kind of what footnotes are for?2) See the first chapter of Patrick DeWitt's The Sisters Brothers._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]"}, {"userName": "Dov Zeller", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller", "userReview": "What do two women, one born in 1907 to James Joyce and Nora Barnacle, and the other born in 1954 to James S. and Nora Atherton, have in common? Have they led strangely parallel lives, and if so, how are these parallels intriguing, instructive or clarifying? That is the mystery set up at the beginning of this book by an odd, fairy tale opening. Once upon a timeAnd long agoA King and QueenHad a daughterHer name wasMarushkaOr LuciaOr Lucy MariaOr Mary.But this opening confuses me, with its flippancy. One or after another. All of the possible names of who this book might call its hero. I thought, this isn't the way a story begins, in which the hero might, really, be anyone. Clearly this opening is meant to call attention to the connection\u2014between Mary and Lucia, and the Jameses and the Noras. But right away it was a bit of a pebble in my shoe, this \"or\" and \"or\" and \"or\", as I stepped into the world of the book. It is perhaps almost fantastical that Lucia Anna Joyce and Mary M. Talbot are daughters of one James and one Nora, the first James being the modernist writer Joyce and the second a well-known Joyce scholar. And perhaps Mary and Lucia had a little more in common than just the names of their parents and the fact that one's father wrote of the other's. Both Lucia and Mary, after all, sought the love and perhaps approval of their fathers, didn't they? And both had the rhythmic prose, the voice of Joyce, in ear-shot from the beginning. As the book opens, Mary walks around with snippets of Joycean prose unconsciously salting and peppering her thoughts. It is a music that is already inside her head. But is that enough of a connection to fuel this memoir?This is a memoir/biography of two women whose lives and work are in themselves intriguing, and whose connections are interesting. But the tangling their lives up in the context of this book feels not quite settled or satisfying. I have wanted to read more about the life of Lucia Joyce since reading the recent graphic biography of Joyce \"Portrait of a Dubliner\" and I was looking forward to \"Dotter of Her Father's Eyes.\" But I don't know that there is a meaningful enough connective balance of exploration in here. The transitions between one life and another are jarring and don't do much to work in terms of shaping the text. What this book does do well is to show that what a person sees outside of a familial world might be starkly and shatteringly different from what one would see when the family is alone. The seeming charm of parents can turn to hideousness the moment a guest closes the door behind them. The book also shows that the men of so-called modernism aren't necessarily modern at all. Perhaps their art has a certain 'newness' to it, but the writers themselves might be horrifying, violent, narcissistic creeps who are unable to see women as anything but objects. I'm glad this book exists, but I wish that there were more of it, more exploration of the lives of Mary and Lucia and a deeper building of connection, any kind of connection between them. I am between a 3 and a 4 in the gr star rating system. This is a nice potential antidote to the books that are so obsessed with male writers and scholars, and the homosocial world of 20th century fiction. But, I found the book to be a bit disappointing. I suppose if I could give this book a 3.5 i would."}, {"userName": "Sam Quixote", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote", "userReview": "\"Dotter of Her Father's Eyes\" is about the father/daughter relationships of two women - Mary Talbot, wife of Bryan Talbot (writer/artist extraordinaire of such books as Luther Arkwright, One Bad Rat, Nemesis the Warlock, Sandman, and the Grandville series), and Lucia Joyce, daughter of legendary novelist James Joyce (author of Ulysses, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and Dubliners).The book alternates between the two women at similar points in their lives from childhood to adolescence to adulthood and shows parallels between them and their fathers. Mary's father was an eminent James Joyce scholar whose work \"The Books at the Wake\" remains the best book written analysing Joyce's incredibly difficult novel \"Finnegan's Wake\", and in turn an equally difficult man to get along with. Mary details her clashes with her dad who was mentally abusive to her while growing up, often belittling her achievements and dreams.Lucia's father wasn't abusive - Joyce was too wrapped up in his own writings to be that way - and he was generally quite involved in raising his daughter, but when she became a young woman wanting to become a professional dancer and start an independent career, Joyce and his shrill wife forbade it to the point where she became so frustrated she threw a chair at her mother. Incredibly this incident led to her becoming institutionalised, a forced way of life that she would never escape until her death.Mary Talbot's writing is superb and she brings to life her story with warmth and candour, perfectly matching her husband's artwork in tone and mood. The book is enthralling to read and, for Mary, ultimately a happy ending. For Lucia, it's hard to imagine a thwarted dance career and an overbearing mother could lead to a decades long imprisonment, but perhaps it really was all that - maybe there is more to her story than presented here.I loved Bryan Talbot's work in this book. It's not nearly as polished or dramatic as his work in books like Grandville, and the book is coloured infrequently, mostly in sepia tones throughout, but it's still wonderful to see. His depiction of Lucia's descent into madness is as high a quality fans have come to expect from this artist, while the drawing of he and Mary's wedding day is very beautiful in its simplicity and expression of pure happiness.\"Dotter of her Father's Eyes\" is a fascinating comic book of human relationships and the importance of an unshackled human spirit, but moreover it's a great read. Who knew that Bryan Talbot's wife was also a talented writer? Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Alex Sarll", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5866774-alex-sarll", "userReview": "I knew James Joyce's daughter Lucia ended up in a madhouse, largely because that's the subject of the chapter which seemed to be holding up Alan Moore's second novel, but little else about her. Turns out a lot of her problems stem from her none-more-modernist father being terribly old-fashioned when it came to subordination of a daughter's wishes to her father's needs (though by the sound of it the mother was even more to blame). Mary Talbot's father, a Joyce scholar, was likewise beloved by the world but a prick to her. And the intertwined story of the two women's lives is illustrated by Mary's husband Bryan, who may implicitly have been responsible for stopping Mary from going the way of Lucia, because hippy that he was he proved a much better white knight than Sam Beckett (then again, wouldn't anyone?). Mary then annotates Bryan's comics version to pick up on all the stuff he's got wrong. The whole business is quite upsetting. Why are people such dicks to their families?"}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "Interesting tale of two daughters, both sort of cast off or neglected or verbally abused by their famous fathers, one, Lucia, daughter of James Joyce, tragically lost due to parental mistreatment; the other, Mary Talbot, the author and feminist literary critic, the daughter of a famed Joyce scholar, also maligned and mistreated. Ironic, in the authors are so highly esteemed by the world, and yet so mired in patriarchal conceptions of women and girls.

Talbot, daughter of Joyce scholar James S. Atherton and a respected academic in her own right). Talbot had a pretty big \"in\" in terms of an artist for her first graphic novel, seeing as her husband is the legendary Bryan Talbot, the award-winning creator of many comics and graphic novels, from the groundbreaking The Adventures of Luther Arkwright to heartbreaking The Tale of One Bad Rat to the genre-busting Alice in Sunderland and more.Given that I've long been a fan of Bryan Talbot's work and studied (end enjoyed!) a fair bit of Joyce in my undergraduate and graduate student days, I was prepared to love this book. Sadly, I only liked it well enough - usually that's fine, but I had such high hopes, given its subject matter and pedigree. Mary is a fine writer, without question, and Bryan's artwork is top-notch as ever (although this is not the bravura performance he gave in Sunderland), but I just didn't feel that these two stories really needed to be told together, or that they benefited much from their joining. It's true that there are obvious linkages between the two (Joyce, most obviously, plus enigmatic fathers), but those links don't really add up to much in the telling, apart from those basic means of comparison.Lucia's story is heartbreaking, to be sure. A talented dancer, she found her life choices always constrained and compromised by her parents' constant moving from one country to another, even after Lucia reached adulthood. Her eventual committal to a mental institution in 1932 (her first of what became many stays) is as terrible as it is incomprehensible: After one of many rows, Lucia throws a chair at her mother, and \"Her brother made a snap decision. He had her committed\" (82). We're not given any hint previously that anyone in her family thought she had mental issue: She fights with her parents and chafes at their control, yes, but who doesn't, really? In this telling, this \"snap decision\" signals the end of Lucia's active life - the book ends less than ten pages later. It's a tragedy, without question, but an incomprehensible one here. Surely there has to be more to the story than a simple \"snap decision\" by her brother.Mary's own story, growing up the only daughter in a postwar British household, is engaging, if sad: Eager to please but also intelligent and headstrong, Mary constantly runs afoul of her father and his snap-temper. Perhaps the book's most powerful and damning observation appears on page 30: \"Claims about men being unable to express emotion irritate me to no end. My father did anger very well.\" The love story between Mary and Bryan charms though suggestion; there's enough tensions here to sustain a much longer, more detailed narrative.Visually, the book is divided into three portions: The present-day frame story, in clearly inked full color panels; Lucia's story, in borderless blue-grey; and Mary's story, borderless and primarily in sepia. The borderless panels throughout both help to emphasize the flashback nature of the narrative and allow for some beautifully blended page layouts. In Mary's story, the artwork is the least polished, with preliminary pencil lines and paste-up markings visible. I'm guessing this is somehow to make that section feel more \"authentic,\" perhaps, as it is the author's own memories? I don't know - it doesn't look incomplete, exactly, but it is rougher... maybe to mirror Mary's own pain at \"becoming\" an adult?The pages also show evidence that it was a couple who created the book. There are several places where Mary inserts a footnote about something that Bryan got \"wrong\" (the frilly apron that her mother never would have worn, the favorite children's book of Bryan's that he \"snuck \" into a montage of her favorite children's books), and a place or two where we see \"dueling footnotes\" from both author and artist. It's a cute personal touch, but it creates a bit of tension when it comes to how the book presents history: If there are factual errors (such as they are) in the Mary sections, might the same be true in the Lucia sections? If the book were Mary's (and, to a lesser extent, Bryan's) story alone, these moments would seem utterly good-natured and fun; but they introduce questions of authenticity that seem strange in a book that's based as much on research as it is on memory.Still and all, I'm glad I read Dotter of Her Father's Eyes. It's an enjoyable if at times painful set of true tales, of interest to readers of biography and history and literature. I imagine that, seeing as how it was awarded the Costa prize for biography, it will serve to introduce non-comics readers to the graphic novel format, which is a good thing, and I'm looking forward to what both Mary and Bryan have coming next.[originally posted at: http://one-sentence-reviews.blogspot.... ]"}, {"userName": "Aine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51597569-aine", "userReview": "Graphic novel in which Mary Talbot draws the parallels between her own life and that of Lucia Joyce.

If readers who wouldn't otherwise look at a graphic novel are encouraged to do so then that's great, but this isn't an outstanding example of the genre. This book covers fairly similar territory to Alison Bechdel's Fun Home, but Fun Home is much better book. Mary Talbot recounts her childhood and teenage years growing up respectably poor in Wigan with a tyrannical Father who is a school teacher and respected Joyce scholar, and she draws parallels between her life and that of James Joyce's daughter Lucia. They both struggle against the limitations and expectations their parents and wider society place upon them as women. Lucia's story ends tragically with her being committed to an insane asylum for decades, whilst Mary meets Brian Talbot and seems to go on to have a successful marriage and career. This book belongs to a subgenre of feminist literature which examines the lives of the wives, sisters or daughters of famous men. Personally, I don't really give a shit about the life of Mrs Shakespeare or Miss Milton. I'm interested enough to learn about them in the context of a biography of the great men they are connected too, but I can't see why anyone would be interested in reading a whole separate biography. Lord Byron's daughter Ada Lovelace went on to be a pioneering mathematician, she achieved things herself and interest in her isn't entirely dependent upon her connection to a great man. I am unaware of any books on the subject of the husbands, brothers or sons of famous men or women. I do not lack empathy for the Lucia Joyce, or Mary Talbot for that matter. Lucia had a really rough time and I feel sorry for her. I do take issue with the fact that people may read this book without knowing anything else about James Joyce and come away with the impression that he was a misogynist and a monstrous father. It may be true that he didn't offer his full support to Lucia in her efforts to become a modernist dancer, or stop his wife from crushing her dreams, but that wasn't Joyce's only failing or eccentricity. He was a bizarre, unique man as geniuses often are and he left a trail of bad feeling and destruction in his wake. Joyce's behaviour towards Lucia wasn't separate from his behaviour towards anyone else. When he says to his daughter \"Lucia, Lucia. Be content. It's enough if a woman can write a letter and carry an umbrella gracefully\" I think a lot of readers will come away from this utterly horrified from a feminist point of view. Joyce didn't conduct himself according to the generally accepted standards of behaviour of his time and place. He read the renaissance guide to conduct the Book of the Courtier by Baldesar Castiglioni and adopted it as a code, which lead to his brother telling him he had become more polite, but less sincere. This is exactly the kind of thing you would say or think if you lived according to the principles of the Book of the Courtier. Graham Greene said 'there is a splinter of ice in the heart of every writer' and if Joyce's actions caused pain to his family and those around him because he prioritized his writing over everything else I can't bring myself to regret that."}, {"userName": "Raina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1640308-raina", "userReview": "Bryan Talbot creates some really amazing sequential art. Grandville is a highlight of my graphic novel reading history. Alice in Sunderland is an amazing monsterwork.Apparently, Mary Talbot is both Bryan Talbot's wife AND an academic expert on things like feminism and teen magazines and other things I'd enjoy studying. This book is partially an autobiography of Mary (drawn by Bryan) and sort of a biography of the daughter of James Joyce. The two stories run parallel with different color schemes and illustration styles showing which story the Talbots are telling.It's a neat idea. Mary Talbot's father was a prominent Joycean scholar and Lucia Joyce was a dancer in Paris who studied with Raymond Duncan (Isadora's brother) and Margaret Morris. Mary had a very negative relationship with her father, and Lucia had a good one with hers, though unfortunately the restrictions around women in her time lead to an eventual tragic end. Interesting, interesting, interesting.Although Bryan's illustrations are lovely, occasionally the storytelling feels a little clunky. The narrative begins with Mary (though she's not identified) chosing to read a biography of Lucia on the train. After only a couple of pages, we transition into Mary's early life, but her story is told in first person. It is unclear whether the story is what Mary is reading or something she is thinking about. I found myself looking back and forth trying to figure out whose story was being told. Now that I know everyone's names, it's clear that this is the early life of Mary, but the way the book is introduced, it could easily have been Lucia. This is merely the first example of the occasionally confusing narrative. Another thing that struck me as odd were the notes in small print typed in a few places. They start \"NB\" and comment on the illustrations (i.e. \"My mother wouldn't have been seen dead in a frilly apron\" when the apron in the frame is a frilly one). It's never explained why those kinds of details weren't changed as the couple worked on this book together. I didn't see the point.Overall, though, I enjoyed these stories.

As\u00ed, todo resulta m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil, m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido, m\u00e1s limpio. Entonces, volvemos a escribir todo esto: Hija de James Joyce, Lucia Joyce empez\u00f3 a tener problemas mentales all\u00e1 por mil novecientos treinta. Tratada incluso por Carl Jung, poco despu\u00e9s ser\u00e1 diagnosticada esquizofr\u00e9nica, pasando pr\u00e1cticamente los \u00faltimos cincuenta a\u00f1os de su vida internada. Cincuenta a\u00f1os. Cuando apenas hab\u00eda pasado la veintena.Sin duda, si hay algo que atemoriza al ser humano son las enfermedades mentales. Ya no solo padecerlas, sino verlas en los dem\u00e1s. Los tiempos han avanzado, cierto, pero el miedo es el mismo. Lejos de afrontarlos, de buscarles una raz\u00f3n, para el hombre corriente (incluso para el hombre extraordinario) siempre fueron algo a esconder, a alejar, entre altos muros. Cualquier excepcionalidad deb\u00eda ser combatida con m\u00e9todos que solo buscaban la anulaci\u00f3n de la persona, hasta convertir esos lapsos, esos desbordamientos de la raz\u00f3n o, simplemente, esas excepcionalidades, en un todo. La ni\u00f1a de sus ojos trata la vida de Lucia Joyce desde la adolescencia hasta la enfermedad. A la vez es tambi\u00e9n la vida de Mary M. Talbot, guionista del c\u00f3mic, hija de James S. Atherton, uno de los mayores especialistas en la vida de James Joyce. Si algo conecta la vida de ambas, no es el destino, sino precisamente las circunstancias. La delgada l\u00ednea que puede separar la locura de una vida plena.Lucia Joyce viaja con sus padres y su hermano, Stephen, por buena parte de Europa. Carentes de todo dinero, el suyo es un viaje en el que lo \u00fanico que llevan encima es la pobreza y el manuscrito del Ulises, que Joyce anda escribiendo por entonces. Solo su llegada a Par\u00eds empezar\u00e1 a darle una cierta tranquilidad (precisamente con la publicaci\u00f3n del libro). Joyce era un avanzado de su tiempo para la escritura, pero profundamente conservador para algunas otras cosas. Entre ellas, que Lucia pretenda otra cosa que convertirse en una perfecta ama de casa. Pero Lucia tiene otros sue\u00f1os. En concreto la danza. Sigue cursos, entra en algunos ballets, avanza. Joyce, que sent\u00eda un profundo cari\u00f1o por ella, aun pod\u00eda intentar comprenderlo (aunque fuera como el capricho de una ni\u00f1a), pero no as\u00ed su madre, Nora Barnacle, que lo considera una estupidez. Sus \u00e9xitos iniciales no le dicen nada, y esa imposibilidad de realizarse la conducir\u00e1 a un callej\u00f3n sin salida del que no podr\u00e1 escapar.Mary M. Talbot no se puede decir que ni tan siquiera tuviera el cari\u00f1o de su padre, m\u00e1s preocupado por Joyce que por su familia. El retrato no es amable. Nada amable. Los momentos de cari\u00f1o hacia su hija son tan escasos que parecen limosnas. No son los tiempos del escritor irland\u00e9s, cierto. E incluso sus intenciones como padre pueden resultar diametralmente opuestas (aunque despu\u00e9s de todo haya una voluntad de construir la vida de su hija). Entonces se encontrar\u00e1 con Bryan, quedar\u00e1 embarazada de \u00e9l, se casar\u00e1n y su vida sufrir\u00e1 un cambio, una liberaci\u00f3n, una realizaci\u00f3n.Ese Bryan es Bryan Talbot. Seguramente, para cualquier aficionado al c\u00f3mic no es necesario presentar a Bryan Talbot (aqu\u00ed, claro, el dibujante). Dibujante underground, autor de obras como Judge Dredd, Sandman o Batman: Dark legends, por citar aquellas que m\u00e1s pueden sonar a los profanos, que no necesariamente las mejores, Talbot es uno de los dibujantes de c\u00f3mics m\u00e1s importantes del momento. Para poner en vi\u00f1etas la historia de su mujer y, tambi\u00e9n, la historia de Lucia Joyce, el artista ingl\u00e9s se entrega al uso de infinidad de recursos, en especial en lo referente a la representaci\u00f3n de las escenas (concebidas como momentos de vida) y el uso del color. Con un trazo que puede nos remite a un diario dibujado (aunque esto no est\u00e9 al alcance de muchos), simple en apariencia pero complicado en la construcci\u00f3n de esa simpleza, constituye el perfecto contrapunto a esas historias que, igualmente en su simpleza, en su ejemplaridad, contienen todo su dramatismo, toda la complejidad de las relaciones humanas, de los temores y las frustraciones.Escrito para D\u00e9tour."}, {"userName": "Linde", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5637212-linde", "userReview": "A biography and an autobiography all in one. Sort of. Mary M. Talbot is the daughter of James S Atherton, eminent Joyce scholar and author of the much acclaimed The Books at the Wake: A Study of Literary Allusions in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake and Bryan Talbot, who kindly provided the illustrations to Dotter of Her Father's Eyes, is her husband.Mary M. Talbot compares her childhood to that of James Joyce's daughter Lucia (1907 - 1982), both fathers are preoccupied with writing and appear to have increasingly less time for their daughters. Whereas Talbot turns out rather well - she is a scholar whose published works deal with \"language, gender, and power\", and she is, presumably, happily married - Lucia Joyce's childhood and later life are not quite as happy. Not much about her early life is known - though many speculations exist - born in Trieste, Italy she lived a far from stable life (the Joyce's are known to have moved house and country a lot, due to the war(s) as well as financial difficulties) which can't have been beneficial to her aspirations to become a professional dancer. In the 1930s her mental health started to deteriorate and she was eventually admitted as a patient by Carl Jung.My issue with the account of Lucia Joyce's life in this novel is that the author relies heavily on Carol Schloss's Lucia Joyce: To Dance in the Wake (2003). Schloss argues that Lucia was Joyce's muse for Finnegans Wake and, more important, that her mental state was at least partially caused by her mother, Nora Joyce. In Dotter of her Father's Eyes Nora is portrayed as someone who cared very little about her daughter's happiness which is then related to the time in which she grows up when sons were still regarded as much more important, and perhaps valuable, than daughters. I can see how Lucia's ambitions as a dancers may have been thwarted - partially - by both her parents who didn't think that a career outside the home was something for young women to aspire to at all. However, the mother-daughter relationship, to me, is nothing more than conjecture and speculation as neither Talbot nor Schloss would know how exactly Nora Joyce treated her daughter. Plus, I can't imagine her to be this evil sort of woman who doesn't care much about her daughter at all.I am giving this book three stars, mostly for the illustrations and Talbot's writing about her own life. I am not quite so enthusiastic about her account of Lucia Joyce's childhood.__________________"}, {"userName": "Camilla", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8907630-camilla", "userReview": "Dotter of Her Father's Eyes is a book of parallels. The writer, Mary Talbot is the only daughter of a (still) highly respected Joycean scholar. Upon finding his old railcard, she reminisces about her childhood and draws comparisons between it and that of Lucia Joyce, dancer daughter of James Joyce. There are small similarities (both have parents named Jim and Nora), but the main one, and indeed the focus of the book, is their troubled relationships with their fathers. Mary's is cold and emotionally abusive; Lucia's is old fashioned and refuses to let her live her life. Both women suffer as a result, and both reach out for love, with opposite effects. The artwork was a turn off for me at first. To me, it looks like an old fashioned comic book. I did come to appreciate it shortly however, and now after finishing the book I find it actually beautiful in spots. Bryan Talbot, the artist and husband of the writer, changed the color scheme to differentiate between the different stories, but the transition was always smooth an natural, despite there being no warning of a change in neither text nor art. As far as the story goes, it's good. Two strong women, one who gave up dancing, one who couldn't give up dancing, trying to cope with life with their fathers makes for a very interesting read, especially if the reader is interested in feminism in any form. The author does not try to force the similarities between Lucia's life and her own; she openly acknowledges differences, but clearly still feels connected to Joyce's daughter. The dialogue is sometimes unnatural, but this is hardly ever the case. As it's Mary Talbot's first graphic novel, I find the small lack of sincere sounding dialogue excusable. The book isn't typical of its medium. I find it to be much more intelligent and subtle than many graphic novels I've read (and enjoyed), and I think that the genre of thoughtful graphic novels is rising. I very much enjoyed this book. The story seemed cut a little short, but I suppose wanting more is the biggest sign of a good one."}, {"userName": "Graham ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11188987-graham", "userReview": "This was a very fine graphic novel, I thought. It's actually more of a memoir. The authors are husband wife, Mary Talbot who is an academic and her husband Bryan, who is a famous illustrator of graphic novels and author of Alice in Sunderland, which I think is wonderful too. Mary's father was a leading scholar of James Joyce, but a difficult and angry man. Mary's childhood is vividly and sensitively described, in words and pictures. She takes up dancing and loves it, but has to give it up. She learns that Lucia, James Joyce's daughter was also very fond of dancing, but was forced to give it up by her mother and father. I hadn't realised that Joyce was such a misogynist. Somehow I'd assumed that because he was avant garde in his literary views he would also be progressive in his social views. Silly me!Lucia's story is a tragic one, but also fascinating, for example when she is committed to a mental asylum in France under the Nazi occupation and she was lucky to survive.The parallels between Mary and Lucia are very well done, and it is intriguing (and perhaps very post-modern) that Mary and Bryan are both characters in the book.The description of 1920's Paris are another attraction, including the account of Shakespeare and Co., the famous left-bank bookshop that Annie and I visited on our visit to Paris in 2012. It is full of references to Hemingway, Joyce, and the other writers who frequented it. I also hadn't realised that Beckett had been so close to Joyce - and in fact had a friendship with Lucia.Altogether a very rewarding book in a small compass. It has won the Costa prize for fiction (or possibly biography), the first time a graphic novel has won a major literary category. Whether it wins the overall Costa prize for best book we shall learn in February, I think. It must be a strong contender."}, {"userName": "Shauna Masura", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6290731-shauna-masura", "userReview": "Part memoir, part biography, Dotter of Her Father's Eyes is also a graphic novel with it's own brand of angst and parental disdain. Two women from different time periods, related only through their fathers interests, are compared to one another in a number of ways. The daughter of author James Joyce tries to make her way in the Parisian dance world of the 1920's, with her own promise outweighed by the genius of her father. Eventually sent to an insane asylum, she was never able to reunite with the family that cast her off. Meanwhile in the 1960's, the daughter of a Joycean scholar (author Mary Talbot) relives her young adult life, growing up under a father who never related to her in a meaningful way. He spent all his time so wrapped up in the works of another man that he never appreciated the family he created. These parallel lives are drenched in teenage self-importance and a deeply troubled sense that others do not consider their desires. Both young women are also stifled by their inability to find their own voices and unable to flourish under parental pressures. Dotter of Her Father's Eyes is a story that many young people might be able to relate to, but presents no critical thought or substance behind the actions of self-indulgent teens. It is pure activity and narrative without reflection and meaning. Illustrations are standard-issue comics yet utilize multiple color palettes to represent different story lines. The present is saturated in realistic tones; the life of Lucia Joyce is presented in monochromatic black and white; and the story of Mary Talbot is muted and subdued. All in all, Dotter of Her Father's Eyes is not really worth the read."}, {"userName": "Elia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6496061-elia", "userReview": "There are two things I should say before reviewing this book: one, I despise James Joyce, and two, I rarely read biographies of any sort. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed Dotter of Her Father's Eyes. The book is really two separate biographies interwoven - the biography of author Mary Talbot and the biography of James Joyce's daughter Lucia, wich intersect in creative and unusual ways.Talbot's story mainly focuses on her relationship with her father - a Joycean scholar and a mean, terrible, controlling man - and the inpact he had on her as an a young girl and later as an adult. This story (set mainly in the 60's and 70's and told in sepia tones with occasional bursts of color and Talbot's occasional commentary on the art (beautifully rendered by Talbot's husband Bryan)) occasinally jumps over to the soty of Lucia Joyce and her relationship with dance. These sections are clearly differentiated from the Talbot sections by being told in a sort of grayish blue wash, that harkens back to the silent films popular in the 1920's and 30s (the era in which these passages are set). As an avowed daddy's girl, I found my heart breaking for both Talbot, who clearly feared and often hated her father while at the same time desperately longing for his love and acceptance as well as for Joyce. The latter woman being someone who by contrast had a loving father who nonetheless suceeded in crushing her spirit by failing to support her one true love - her career as a dancer.Overall I found this book to be quite enjoyable, and though it did nothing to change my oppinion of Joyce as a writer, it did serve to make me care for an admire his daughter as well as both Talbots' talents in writing and in art."}, {"userName": "Mymbleth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39609336-mymbleth", "userReview": "B. Talbot's art style is warm and engaging, and I enjoyed the two author's small diversions into aspects of their own relationship. Though, the lasting note of their marriage in the novel is Mary's horrific childbirthing experience and sudden plunge into motherhood, which jars with the creative and happy collaborative relationship that the book's existence evidences. In general I would have preferred much more detail of Mary's later life and career, to form a more poignant contrast with Lucia Joyce's stifled artistic career, instead of the repetitive emphasis of her childhood self in screaming matches with her father. Having recently read Fun Home, I can't help but contrast the two, and find Dotter suffering in the comparison. It seems a little too lightweight for the subject matter, and lacks the real soul-baring insight of Bechdel's bio/autobio.

Mary's father James S. Atherton is a dedicated Joycean scholar. So\u00a0this is a story of two daughters and their fathers - who never crossed path, so there are 2 parallel story lines.I, for one, was quite confused at the beginning about who is who.

Mary Talbot and her husband Bryan combine to produce this work which interleaves incidents from Mary\u2019s own growing up years and her relationship with her father and of Lucia Joyce, daughter of famed writer James Joyce (of Ulysess fame).Mary\u2019s father is a famed Joycean scholar and respected among his peers and in professional circles, but at home he increasingly becomes distant, angry, snide and keeps a sarcastic undertone for most of his interactions with his growing daughter. As she pursues her arts degree and PhD, and finds love and marriage with Bryan, her interactions with him become increasingly fraught and distant. Lucia Joyce, on the other hand, appears to have a caring father \u2013 but one who was not as modernist in his personal thoughts as he was considered in literary circles. Her passion in dance threatened to take her to great heights, but a constant demonizing from her mother and a patriarchal underpinning of her ambitions by even her father does not help. In order to placate his eternally caustic wife, Joyce doesn\u2019t seem to be able to encourage his daughter, and instead belittles her talents suggesting that all a woman needs to do is be able to walk gracefully into a room. This shocking lack of perspective leads to her slow disintegration and estrangement from her family. More curiously, even Mary\u2019s father despite obviously studying Joyce in depth does not seem to gleam these simple observations and put it forth in his dealings with his own family. His lack of warmth and understanding to his family is harder to understand considering the source (Joyce\u2019s life) he has to work with. Though Mary has a relatively more serene passage in life, these troubling episodes reflect the dangers of equating public and professional respect and admiration into the private space. Despite being respectively admired in their professional worlds, both these men seemed lacking in their handling of their personal life.It was a nice theme, but a bit too slight for my taste. Apart from what I\u2019ve mentioned above, I couldn\u2019t find much to champion the cause of interleaving the stories. At times, the jumps seemed disjointed. It would have been fascinating to have a more detailed look at Lucia\u2019s life though. However, the book is worthwhile for lovers of graphic novels. The artwork is beautiful and the story interesting enough. And you do take away a simple but seemingly hard to grasp fact of life \u2013 Treat your family well.

On the book it is \u201cDotter of her Father\u2019s Eyes\u201d, a lower case \u201ch\u201d, where one would normally expect \u201cDotter of Her Father\u2019s Eyes\u201d. It\u2019s a small thing, and something I only noticed when I was looking at the cover as I started to write this, but it\u2019s a good example of how much this book rewards close and repeated readings. The lower case here is significant as the whole book is about gender, about the oppression of women during the twentieth century and their changing status.The book deals with Mary Talbot\u2019s upbringing and her relationship with her father, a leading Joycean scholar, in parallel with that of James Joyce\u2019s tragic daughter Lucia. The narrative rarely takes place in the present, but in an early scene where Mary is chatting to two of here colleagues about Lucia Joyce who ask if she is finding parallels, she replies:\u201cI bloody hope not! She spent most of her life in mental institutions.\u201dAs the story goes on though, we do find some parallels, but the gender has changed. Lucia is oppressed and opposed in her creativity, and dealt with coldly, by her mother, who seems bitter that Lucia is, initially at least, able to be more independent than her mother could ever have dreamed of being. It isn\u2019t spelled out in the book, but one gets the impression that her mother\u2019s deep lying resentment comes from having the burden of being responsible for raising a family whilst her husband indulges every artistic whim, dragging the family hither and thither with little to no security other than can be obtained by his reputation as a Modernist genius.Lucia has a talent and a drive for dance, and it is her relentless pursuit of this, which only mirrors her father\u2019s relentless pursuit of literary perfection, which results in her persecution and mental instability. Ultimately she is betrayed by her father, on whom she should have been able to rely as a fellow artist, in this exchange:\u201cLucia, dearest, this latest obsession is doing you no good. You have to stop. Find some other creative outlet. This dancing is too much for you.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s my life, Babbo. How can I not dance?\u201d\u201cLucia, Lucia. Be content. It\u2019s enough if a woman can write a letter and carry an umbrella gracefully.\u201dAlthough Lucia is not committed to an asylum until her brother does it after she attacks her mother during an argument, it feels like this is where she is broken. The one person you would expect support from, who seems to pride himself on how unconventional he is, reveals his own conventional prejudices on a woman\u2019s place in society.As mentioned before, there do appear to be parallels between Mary and Lucia. These help show how the role of women in society has changed somewhat over the years, but more importantly also help bring home the impact of these attitudes due to Mary being brought up in a \u201cnormal\u201d (for want of a better word) household in the north-west of England. For somebody like me, from a similar area if not era, Mary\u2019s story brings the message home very effectively.Mary\u2019s story shows her father, her \u201ccold mad feary father\u201d to be emotionally distant and angry, with the occasional bouts of closeness. He is emotionally and physically violent towards his daughter, and loves to put her down. Two instances of this come to the fore immediately. The first is when Mary\u2019s mother is reading out her good school report which states that Mary always tries, to which her father retorts, \u201cMary is always trying. How true!\u201d. this scene goes on to show him decrying all women using a latin phrase from a poem. When he should be building up his daughter\u2019s confidence, he seems to wish to demolish it simply so he can, in his own eyes, look clever. The other is when she completes her BA at Preston Polytechnic, whilst she has a young family to tend to, and to which he says, \u201cB.A? Bloomin\u2019 Awful!\u201d. However unlike Lucia, Mary is empowered to stand up for herself, to defy this misogynist:\u201cNo, Dad. Brilliant Achievement!\u201dTo be honest, the emotional response in the reader at this point is to cheer her to the rafters.There are other obvious parallels between Lucia and Mary\u2019s experiences. Mary too desires to be a ballerina. In a class at her primary school the children are being asked what they wish to do when they grow up. A girl who answers that she would like to be a nurse gains approval, \u201cWell that\u2019s a nice job for a girl...\". Mary makes a rather innocent but cutting answer:\u201cAnd Mary, what about you?\u201d\u201cI want to be a ballerina, Sister Bernadette.\u201d\u201cWell now, that\u2019s pretty, I suppose. And if God doesn\u2019t want you to be a ballerina, what else would you like to do?\u201d\u201cDraw a pension, Sister.\u201dThis is an allusion to a remark made by one of her working class neighbours who where looking after her whilst her mother was at work after school. Class runs through this as well, which is to be expected of a story emerging from Britain, but it is pretty much subsumed by that of gender. After all women where subject to prejudice and misogyny regardless of what class they belonged to.One scene that does need to mentioned is the rather horrific birth scene. I was born in the same era as Mary and Bryan\u2019s sons in 1970, and the thought that women had to experience such neglect for the physical and emotional well being during birth such a short time ago is quite appalling.In all of this I have failed to mention Bryan Talbot\u2019s artwork. In most cases with an artists so well known, you could say that it was in his usual style and up to his usual standard. Unfortunately that is never the case with Mr. Talbot. It is up to his usual standard in every way. In terms of pure storytelling, this is a comic which a lot of artists would do well to study. Clear and concise, it gets all the information required over to the reader so that you are never forced to read a page two or three times just to understand what is going on at the most fundamental level.Any reader of Bryan\u2019s though would understand that the man has no set style. He has a huge range, using what is most appropriate to the story being told, whether that is the intense science fiction action caperings of Luther Arkwright, the distressing but uplifting \u201cTale of One Bad Rat\u201d, the experimental \u201cAlice in Sunderland\u201d or sundry others. In this he has used a ligne clair style for the most part, with deviation for some of the more emotionally dramatic sequences involving Lucia. Particularly effective is the page design for Lucia\u2019s committal to asylum. Overall there is so much to this book that it will take me a few more readings to fully appreciate everything that is being said. There is a lot more to it than I have mentioned here, and I look forward to Mary M Talbot\u2019s historical graphic novel. If it is a fraction as good as this then it will still be better than 99% of everything else."}], "description": "Part personal history, part biography, Dotter of Her Father''s Eyes contrasts two coming-of-age narratives: that of Lucia, the daughter of James Joyce, and that of author Mary Talbot, daughter of the eminent Joycean scholar James S.
