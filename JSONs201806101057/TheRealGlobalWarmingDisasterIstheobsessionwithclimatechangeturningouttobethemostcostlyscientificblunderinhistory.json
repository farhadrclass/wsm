No, I'm not a Conservative. No, I'm not religious. No, I'm not a redneck. Just any quick search to the comments section of any article about \"climate change not being man-made\" will display numerous angry replies akin to \"the scientists say you're wrong. I believe in the scientists. I never question science or wonder if some 'science' is inaccurate, biased, money-fueled or alarmist. You who doubts man-made climate change must be wrong because scientists are always right. If you doubt man-made climate change and support the use of coal and oil, you must be some kind of backwoods, uber-religious Trump-supporter.\" (for the record, I do believe in climate change, I just don't believe that it is caused by human activity).So, finally a book comes along that dares to question man-made climate change. It has in recent years become taboo almost to question it, because science tells us on our television screens and in our newspapers that everything we as a civilized society use day-to-day, from manufactured goods to fuel for our cars, is going to heat up the world by a possible 5 whole degrees (I hate Winter, bring it on!). So we are told that we need to start being more \"progressive\" - and that means adopting the aesthetics of an episode of The Jetsons by putting up wind turbines, solar panels, buying self-driving cars, building disposable houses that look more like boxes than homes, you name it. And this stuff is not only visually ugly, but it is expensive and not really showing results. Here in the province of Nova Scotia, we have wind turbines. Come up through New Brunswick to our border and you will see numerous rows of wind turbines, idly sitting, not moving, not generating much of anything, right outside the tourist bureau. Not only do they block a beautiful view of the ocean, but they seem to have been set up only to impress tourists. \"Ooh, look how green and innovative we are!\" even though most of the province still functions on coal, oil, hydroelectric and natural gas. When they do run, these wind turbines are incredibly loud and annoying if you happen to be near them. What they actually do to make a difference, I have no idea. It's not my problem, but I think there are far more important things Nova Scotia could be paying for.The Real Global Warming Disaster questions everything that North American society has come to believe so firmly. Is global warming research really environmentally-focused, or is it all about business and politics? What, if anything, is the difference that all this new \"green technology\" is making? Why are scientists who disagree with man-made climate change being shunned and silenced by the voices of the majority? Isn't science supposed to take into account everybody's arguments, research and findings to be truly sound? This book is in-depth, informative and interesting, and one that everyone should read, whether they believe in man-made climate change or not, because although it's an opposing viewpoint to what we have become used to, it's good to hear both sides of every story."}, {"userName": "Paul McMeekin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1480929-paul-mcmeekin", "userReview": "Everyone should read this.Despite what your 'beliefs' are (and for many people global warming is a belief rather than a known scientific fact) what is clear is that there are two sides to this story. The worrying thing is that only one side is being heard and this is mostly driven by political motives. Proper scientific debate should give equal credence to evidence on all sides, yet anyone who is sceptical about global warming is derided and labeled as being tantamount to a holocaust denier. The irony is that this attitude itself has more in common with facism that the desire to have proper scientific debate without being muzzled."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8724103-peter", "userReview": "A thoroughly researched and well-presented analysis of the recent climate change discourse.

For Booker, the real global warmingdisaster is a misreading of scientific evidence, combined with mediascare stories. Imagined fears, he says, have bulldozed governmentsinto disproportionate and potentially ruinous responses.His scope is wide. From the Medieval Warming to the Little IceAge, Kyoto to Copenhagen, Booker sets out to show that, whenit comes to climate change, there\u2019s nothing new under the sun.But he\u2019s scathing in his contempt for scientists who attempt toairbrush earlier historical changes out of their analyses, just toconvince their audience that today\u2019s climate change is manmade.He\u2019s especially hard on Al Gore\u2019s use of emotive language\u2013 \u201cticking time bomb\u201d \u201ccatastrophe\u201d \u201cepic destruction\u201d\u2013 andshoots down each of Gore\u2019s \u201cinconvenient truths\u201d. He\u2019s equallyscornful of the Met Office forecast of a scorching 2008, justwhen the Northern Hemisphere was suffering the coldest startto a winter for decades.But Booker\u2019s fiercest fire is directed at the Inter-governmental Panelon Climate Change (IPCC), a group of \u201czealots who have repeatedlyrigged the evidence to support their theory.\u201d Far from being a crosssection of scientific opinion, says Booker, the IPCC is committed to strengthening their case for an already firmly held view.As for the vast sums of money being spent on alternative energy sources, the author demonstrates the inadequacy of theirimpact: the 10,000 turbines built in the entire United Statesgenerate no more than the output of large coal-fired powerstation, and they still need back-up from conventional powerstations. Taken together, says Booker, renewables add up to \u201cthemost expensive economic suicide note ever written.\u201dChristopher Booker doesn\u2019t deny the climate is changing. Buthe does see the need for a proper debate on why it\u2019s changing.It should be possible, he suggests, to challenge the consensuswithout being branded insane. His is a persuasive and thoughtprovokingbook that\u2019s sure to unsettle many who thought the science of climate change was settled."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5080146-chris", "userReview": "It's not easy to write a review of this book, not because I didn't enjoy it, but rather because I find myself writing why I agree with Christopher Booker and disagree with all the environmentalists. So it may be best to keep this short, but I would certainly suggest that everyone, regardless of which view you agree with, read this, as this will balance out the argument that we are not being allowed to debate.The reason I picked this book up in the first place was because I have never accepted the 'consensus' view about Global Warming that we are pummeled with by the media day and night, and it's nice to see that someone is not too scared to write a book that disagrees with that view too.I had been thinking that there would be an awful lot of science in the book, and, there is some but, what the book really does is show us is to what extent the people that present us with the 'consensus' bully and attempt to intimidate those who disagree with their view. It also points out how those who tell us that global warming is our fault refuse to fully release their data which is needed to prove that their computer modelling is without fault. We also find out that a lot, if not most, of the statistical data is cherry picked or altered to 'prove' their argument. It's also interesting to find out that the papers that the IPCC present to the world are agreed on my scientists and proof readers, then altered without their knowledge so that they exactly match the views of the governments and IPCC. If more books like this were out there (And trust me, as a bookseller, there aren't that many compared with the 'pro global warming' books) then maybe, the topic wouldn't be such a volatile one to discuss."}, {"userName": "Anita", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3801578-anita", "userReview": "Having read several books on the global warming scandal (my first and favourite being \"Heaven and Earth\") I needed no more convincing that the 'science' behind the scares were bogus.

Those who do are derided as being in the pay of sinister right-wing organizations and are dismissed as \u2018deniers\u2019. The proposition that man-made CO2 is resulting in a dramatic rise in global temperatures is apparently an incontestable fact which is supported by the overwhelming consensus of scientists. Unless humans dramatically alter their way of living\u2014enforced by politicians across the world\u2014the earth\u2019s climate will be irreversibly changed to such an extent that the majority of life it current sustains will potentially perish. It all sounds terrifying. It all sounds utterly disastrous. And indeed it would be if it wasn\u2019t the fact that it is completely unsupported by the scientific evidence. The real global warming disaster, as Christopher Booker explains in this well-researched book, is that a fringe idea based on no hard evidence has become the political issue of our age which threatens to dismantle civilisation in the West and prevent development in the Third World. How we find ourselves in the midst of such hysteria?The answer, according to Booker, is a combination of factors, few of which have anything to do with science. The truth is that a variety of political groups have recognized the concept of anthropogenic global warming as being a vindication for their existence. For Marxists and Environmentalists (fundamentally the same people today) it has given them a guise under which to promote their radical Left-wing politics. Bloated NGOs have found a justification for their existence and continual appeals for cash. And globalists have found an issue that cannot be confined to national entities and thus requires the promotion of supranational legislative bodies such as the United Nations and European Union. Throw in ideologically motivated scientists, self-aggrandizing politicians and a media in desperate need for sensational headlines and you have a recipe for disaster. How this developed is meticulously documented by Booker.There is no scientific consensus or overwhelming evidence to support the view that human behaviour is affecting the earth\u2019s climate. Booker convincingly argues that the scientific process has been utterly distorted and corrupted in the process of promoting the Warmist idea. From reports issues by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (most certainly not \u20182, 500 leading scientists\u2019 but rather a small group of connected academics with an a priori commitment to the warming theory) to Al Gore\u2019s propaganda film \u2018An Inconvenient Truth\u2019 (lambasted by a British High Court judge for its blatant misrepresenting of the data), the evidence put forward has not remotely measured up to a high scientific standard. Most readers will be shocked at the outright deceit Booker exposes that has often been promulgated as science. One example is the claim that polar bear numbers are dramatically reducing to the point of near extinction. The evidence used to support this outlandish claim was an article reporting on four bears dying in a storm. From this insignificant routine event, polar bears have become the icon invoked to demonstrate the deadly effects of climate change, despite the fact that their numbers are actually increasing. As Booker emphasizes, this is the sort of tomfoolery upon which Governments are basing policy.When it comes to scientists who have produced actual evidence that strongly suggests global temperatures are affected by the surface activity of the sun rather than CO2 levels, the response has been one of hostility, intimidation and suppression. Booker produces a litany of highly qualified scientists whose characters and professional integrity have been slandered and vilified for publicly dissenting from \u2018consensus\u2019 view. This is not how science is supposed to work.The book is well researched, extremely well written and is probably the best book one can buy on the history of the global warming concept. Any fair-minded reader should come away, if not a convinced sceptic, then at least troubled at how indistinguishable an apparently scientific idea has become with an ideological crusade. At best the story of the anthropogenic global warming scare is an interesting, if frightening, insight into the hysteria that results from a mixing of dodgy science, politics and sensationalist media. More likely it will be much worse as we witness Western Governments compete to dismantle their own economies whilst denying developing countries the cheap fuel that would enable them to rise out of poverty. Booker has done humanity a profound service by writing in this book and pointing out what will be the real disastrous consequences from global warming."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73440530-ryan", "userReview": "I came to this book already with a growing scepticism to much of the narrative on global warming.Having gone through secondary school during the 2000's and early 2010's in Britain much of the narrative on global warming was thoroughly drilled into myself and many of my peers. The fog of conventional wisdom and lazy thinking meant that I continued to believe in it wholeheartedly until a few years ago when I began to read the opposing view.This book I would say is a great starting point for anyone who is either a) looking to have their views challenged or b) would like a general overview of the sceptics' case on which to then do further reading.In terms of the science, there is sufficient detail to get a basic understanding of some of the variables and factors that shape our climate, in this regard it is by no means comprehensive. Mr Booker does also highlight some of the inconsistencies in the warmists claims. Where the book really shines in on the chronicling of the environmentalist movement and the political decisions made up until the time of the publishing of the book. In this respect, I think the main and best argument against the current orthodoxy is made. In particular the fact that if you take the warmists claims to be true, current measures are little more than a plaster on a gaping wound, as well as the fact that in their current forms all renewable sources of energy (in particular wind) are in a number of ways, not sufficient. I would also recommend reading Mr Booker's columns on the Telegraph website, as he also deals with the issues of the national grid and the consequences of the current push towards electric cars.You will most likely come away either with your current views shaken, bolstered or at the very least challenged. It's clear not only from this book but other sources that the science definitely isn't settled on the subject and whilst I would refrain from dismissing it out of hand the sceptic's case seems more and more compelling and the consequence of these policies more and more costly."}, {"userName": "Mariyan Traykov", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27041120-mariyan-traykov", "userReview": "Thought provoking read.

The title alone can make people start shouting and arguing as soon as I say I have read it. The fact that I give this book four stars will probably make a lot of people very angry. But let me make this clear: I don't necessarily agree with everything this book says. However, I think it makes a very convincing argument and is extremely well written, and it certainly gave me a lot to think about. Hence, I had to give it four stars.Books like these are not only for people who don't believe in global warming. Sure, if you don't then you will probably love this book, because it provides a million and one reasons why the issue has been blown way out of proportion (in the author's opinion). But I think even those who do believe in human-induced climate change can gain a lot from it. To fully understand an issue, you have to look at it from both sides. The government and the media shoves the 'Global Warming Is The Worst Thing To Happen Ever!' side at as every day. This book provides a refreshing look at the other side, made up of cynics and scientists who don't necessarily dispute climate change, but do think that it has been grossly overexaggerated.Don't read this book because you want to scorn at the counter-arguments for climate change. Read this book because you are interested in looking at both sides of a topical issue, then form your own opinion. I'm not saying that you'll like what it says. I disagreed with much of it and wondered at a lot more.

It shows how the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is run by a small group of 'global warming' zealots, who have repeatedly rigged evidence to support their theory.
