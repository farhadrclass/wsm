Also, he'd like to look around for his possibly still-living brother...if there's enough time and he's not killed by hospital zombies. Against all odds (yet again...yawn), John survives the death trap hospital - getting a lookie loo at his wife's peacefully rotting corpse and then honoring her memory by tossing her on a couch and burning the hospital to the ground. Could John have sent her to a fiery grave without risking his/Charlie's lives by touring the zombie-filled hospital? Sure, but who passes up the chance to look at his/her long-dead spouse's decomposing remains? What's that?...Every sane/rational person, you say?- During their escape from the burning hospital, John and his band of suicidals happen upon a note his brother posted on a nearby bridge over one year ago which miraculously (but cryptically) reveals his location. - John finds and rescues his brother (+ sister-in-law and 2 kids) from an isolated cabin where, after managing to survive for over one year, they just so happen to be only days/hours/minutes from certain death due to starvation, zombies, one or more COUGARS who escaped from \"the zoo\", and an imminent raid by Wile E. Coyote (desperate, starving, and equipped with ACME Rocket-Powered Roller Skates). - After doing battle with the zombies and escaping the cabin, John takes his brother/brother's family back to the burgeoning civilization of Leport. He spends a few days with his brother (reminiscing about the old days, exchanging tales of zany post-apocalypse antics), then decides that he must immediately move his own family (including infant son) to the same perilous wilderness cabin from which he just extricated his brother. Let me repeat: John \"Savior of the World\" Talon, thus far portrayed as unilaterally focused on restoring safe communities (\"taking it back\"), suddenly resolves to abandon his friends/newly rescued brother and make a hasty retreat to the isolation and danger of the woods because.....? Life in Leport (post-restored running water) not rustic enough? Town not big enough for 2 Talon boys? Yeah, totally reasonable decision-making in a zombie apocalypse. - Speaking of unbelievable plot elements, let us not forget about Trevor's discovery of the government's \"secret files\" in which their evil plans are laid bare. Just as John suspected (yet again thanks to the evil-detecting radar in his tummy and neck hairs), the evacuation camps/\"State Centers\" were actually a ruse crafted by the evil US government to trick weaker, less self-sufficient Americans into evacuating there. Why? So the quivering mass of socialist leaches could be used as guinea pigs for \"zombie experiments\", of course!! [Little known fact: a shortage of scientific-grade zombie specimens is a common problem, even during a worldwide zombie apocalypse]. Now ain't it just like that evil US government to zombify the majority of its citizens, create an army of the undead, and then use said zombie army to impose control over the few remaining strong, self-sufficient Americans? Incorrigible - that US government is, I tell you - absolutely incorrigible! Word is that they also put fluoride in the water supply to turn us all communist...and they are hiding all around us, just waiting to confiscate our guns...(OMG excuse any typos, the light is so dim in my underground bunker)...buy gold coins...form a militia...

Better yet, an actual plot.There are quite a few things that happen in this book, and things do move along, but by the time you've finished, there is no sense that the plot of the series has actually moved along. Sure the lead characters, their women and children are all in a new place, but that's about it. In the meantime, what you get is something like an old time Western only with zombies with our never wrong hero, visiting various communities, and/or finding survivors who need to be rescued - always in the nick of time - before he wonders off to do the same thing again, for somebody else. Time and time again, he comes across a situation that is black and white, giving him the chance to chose between right and wrong - and he's NEVER wrong - with the result being that a lot of zombies and / or several humans will die.Due to this, characters appear, then disappear all the time with no time to become people to be related too and that's doubly so for the female characters, even those who would otherwise be in the lead roles. All they tend to do is look after the hero's toddler son, and worry about the hero returning, which of course he always does, before almost immediately leaving again for another pointless journey. Fact is we probably know more about the guns being used than the women.That said the set pieces when they happen are done well. The big zombie battles are exciting, although the encounters with other humans, both good and bad, less so.I am still going to continue with the series as it is said to get better. Here's hoping."}, {"userName": "Jodi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5166491-jodi", "userReview": "This is more of a 2.5 but I'll leave it at a 3. The story flows a bit more easily in this book but the character of John grated heavily on my nerves. He's even more Rambo than the first book, if you can believe it. My 3 issues with this novel were 1) Grammar - there seemed to be fewer punctuation and misspelling problems but the lack paragraph indentation was annoying. Also, the author uses the phrase \"idly wondered\" twice in two pages and again about 20 pages later. Not a super big deal but it shouldn't happen in a well-edited book.2) Sexism {SPOILER} - Sarah has been relegated to being the worried girlfriend while John roams about zombie bashing and rescuing survivors. Near the end of the novel, John and his pal, Charlie, TELL their girlfriends they're getting married. They don't ask. That was the end of my tolerance for this character and for the series in general.3) Politics - {SPOILER} John discovers that the US govt planned the zombie protection areas not to save civilians but to experiment on them. PUH-LEASE. Big government is the bad guy here and it's utterly ridiculous. However, the story is compelling and as in the first novel, the action is worth reading. This could be a decent series if an editor were able to fix the grammatical mistakes and encourage the author to let go of his right wing conspiracy theories and let John be an actual human being instead of Mr. Can-Do-No-Wrong.After the telling not asking marriage thing, though, I'll be skipping the next installment."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16951188-mike", "userReview": "I have read book 1 & 2 and thought they were entertaining as there was never a dull moment. The pace was fast and there was nonstop action. However, I can\u2019t get past the fact that the main character John use to be a desk jockey in his prior life and is now a bad ass killing machine who knows how to do EVERYTHING. Furthermore, what kind of dad leaves his baby for 2 days \u2013 2 months to go exploring and clear out zombies? Last but not least, John made a series of questionable / ridiculous decisions.Book 2 ended on a positive note and I might end there. I'm not sure if I want to continue the series.

It really frustrates me when stories drag their feet, but luckily there's no chance of that happening here. If you liked the first of these books, then you'll like this one. It's written very much in the same vein as the book that preceded it, and it moves the story on nicely.The pros and cons are much the same as the book before as well... to be honest, I might as well just say that if you enjoyed the last book then read this. It's not a carbon copy, but it is enough like the other book in tone and progression that you won't be disappointed. 4-stars."}, {"userName": "Angela Coz", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72443332-angela-coz", "userReview": "I gotta say, I love zombie stuff. I'm a bit obsessed. That's probably the biggest reason why I enjoyed this book so much.

In every dark alley, they are lurking. Behind every door, they are hiding. For each survivor of the Upheaval, every day brings the same grim reality: the dead are coming. For every community that managed to survive, for every band that came together, questions nag their minds. Are they alone? Are they the last ones left? Does humanity die with them? As the dead roam the abandoned highways and walk among the ruins of the living, one group will make a stand to halt the tide and take it back.\"\n\u00a0Taking it Back is the second book in The White Flag series. I can't deny the fact that I expected more from this book. In book one, we start out when the outbreak occurs to how do we find stability and some normalcy in the new world. John Talon is able to provide this for his son, and many other grateful survivors. Together they work to make this new place a home. In this new world, we know\u00a0there are people out there who will destroy everything in their path to get what they need, including John Talon's sanctuary.\u00a0Flash forward book 2. Here we are, stuck with John Talon again as he goes on wild hunt to expand what he's grown. This. Is. All. This. Book. Offers. I was extremely disappointed and quite frankly, could not find the motivation to want to read this book. Honestly, it's stopped me from picking up America the Dead..even though I know I will...eventually.\u00a0Talluto gives us repetitive writing with no\u00a0 action to even\u00a0make it bearable. The only time I was zooming through pages was during the huge zombie fight. I wanted and hoped for more gore and more war. During the new world it caaaannnnot be as easy as it has been for John Talon. There has to be other groups out there who want to take what they've created. There have to be hoards of zombies where near-death and death occurs cutting the characters so deep that they adapt wise and cold to the dead world. I'm holding on hope to find this in book 3, America the Dead."}, {"userName": "George", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4219638-george", "userReview": "Another pretty good entry into Zombie fiction! The story keeps moving at a pretty brisk pace. Unlike the first novel this does bring a few new elements into the zombie mythos (glowing eyes and zombie children that move fast). It also introduces an explanation for the 'why' of the outbreak of the zombie virus. For the most part the story is believable (once you get past the zombies part). I liked that people seemed to help each other more than in the Walking Dead novels (where there is a pretty bleak picture of human nature). There were a few grammatical errors, but nothing huge; overall the writing was pretty solid. I think the only thing that bugged me was the mixture of real locations with fictional names and real locations with real names. The survivors are based on LePort (really Lemont/Lockport combined) and travel through Joslin (Joliet), but travel through Coal City, Romeoville, Morris, Seneca, Ottawa, etc. Also a few real locations seem to be moved geographically. I'm not sure why there was the mixture of names and locations, but for someone familiar with the area the story takes place in, it was a bit annoying, especially when some things like street names were even based on real streets. But overall this was a great, well written, exciting read."}, {"userName": "Ryan H", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14998572-ryan-h", "userReview": "This was a great continuation of the series. It picks up almost where the last book left off and there is tons of action. One thing I admire is the creativity the author uses to explore innovative ways to deal with our undead friends. As well if the author does a great job of creating new places for survivors to bunker down and wait out the apocalypse. If that isn't enough to like the modes of transportation and the way the survivors get around is also very creative. There were many pop culture references throughout the book as well that gives the reader a chuckle. I listened to the audiobook edition of this book and the narration was fabulous the pacing was very crucial and great especially when there was more exciting scenes coming up. You have to give credit where credit is due and this narrator does a pretty good woman's voice and trust me I mean that in the best way, take it as a compliment. I can't wait to see what step four of our survivors plans are. Please release book 3 and audiobook form pronto!"}, {"userName": "Johnny Jellyspoon", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27034557-johnny-jellyspoon", "userReview": "The story was gripping and led the reader along at a good pace, although down a fairly well trodden path. The protagonist is a pen pushers ultimate fantasy, and this takes quite a suspension of disbelief; how did he go from administrator to Clint Eastwood in one short step? As with similar novels, the zombies are something of a side show to the somewhat right of centre moralising and air of gritty individualism. The survivors are polarised neatly into 2 camps, the 'good' ones who are trying to rebuild civilisation,and the rest, who are rapist, paedophiles, psychotics etc; this is formulaic and a little tired. Also, the majority of the characters lack depth or are barely credible.The thing that lets the book down most though is the lack of editing; it just needs a general tidy really. Obviously Mr Talluto is no Shakespeare, but that is not a problem with this sort of book, and it deserves 3 stars just for being a good yarn. I would certainly read more of these."}, {"userName": "Chad", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8635667-chad", "userReview": "[In this book it is revealed that the U.S. government knew about the virus for quite some time and set up the camps to cull the population of the useless elements as part of an overall plan to turn people into slaves and take over the whole world.

It's interesting how John and his group manage to clear out small towns of zombies and then set-up small settlements along the river. During the winter, zombies are either frozen or extremely slow, and the various groups of survivors can easily dispose of the undead threats.John's goal is to have each small settlement become self-sufficient, establish communication with others and develop a trade system along the river. Their travels through infected towns are filled with action, terror and hope - leaving readers to cheer on the teams as they scavenge and kill zombies. However, not all of them make it back to the base camp.\"Taking It Back\" is an easy read, but as in the first installment, typos, missing / added words within sentences continues.

This book was a hot pile of garbage. There is no noticeable plot besides that John Talon does stuff and always comes out on top. There is nearly no character development which left me not caring either way what happens to any of the main characters, which was fine because nothing noteworthy happens to them. The role of female characters in this book is simply to get rescued from sexual slavers or to constantly fawn over Talon and make him promise that he is going to come back from whatever suicide mission that he feels like he must embark on. I'm not sure how a book as thin in so many areas is rated over a 4, but I'm not going to worry about that, this is the end of the road for me as far as the 'White Flag of the Dead' is concerned."}, {"userName": "RJ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4187755-rj", "userReview": "Continuing their desire to take back as much of the territory as they can, we move into book two.

Our group proceeds to push their boundaries out further. Adding to their geographical area and their survivor community our intrepid crew pushes on.

The main character is too macho and same goes with other characters- Politics. Everything the goverment does is bad.
