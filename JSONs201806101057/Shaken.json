I actually felt like I was there when the earthquake happened, then again, I'm extremely grateful that I wasn't. Eric Walters is naturally an AMAZING driver and this isn't any different than his other stories. He is an amazing writer and this story truly brings out his talent of writing a fabulous story in a completely different perspective. I would recommend this to anyone! MUST READ!!What is written above is what I thought of the book when I first read it a couple of years ago. My view has DEFINITELY changed now. The book is NOT realistic. I thought that since Walters went to Haiti after the quake he would show a little more emotion, but no. Very disappointing with the ending. It was so abrupt and seemed like he just gave up. When people died he simply said something like \"I crawled up and cried\" then continued onto the next chapter. There were no details to portray the emotions! The way he made the Joshua seem SOOOO heroic was frustrating. When he went into the house to save the baby and he told Phillippe to leave because it's better the debris falling on one person rather than two! JEEZ! Joshua was previously displayed as a teenage boy with minimal muscle. Now he was going to throw away debris to save a baby... BY HIMSELF? No. The overall book didn't interest me and I found it to be quite lacking in many places. As you can see, not the same as what I thought before. I actually don't know why my thoughts would have changed so drastically."}, {"userName": "Shruthi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20417038-shruthi", "userReview": "I've never read an Eric Walters book and actually enjoyed it and unfortunately this book wasn't much better than any of his previous books. I enjoyed the very beginning of the book, and maybe I would have enjoyed this more if it was either more personal and followed Joshua's life as he dealt with the grief of his mother's death or if it was more factual and had more to do with the actual earthquake and the citizens of Haiti.Everything I didn't like about this:- It had an incredibly slow beginning- It was repetitive- None of the characters felt real- Agnostic boy finds his faith after a disaster (really???)- Pacing in general Rating: 60/100Age: 12 & upWarning: death,"}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5713415-helen", "userReview": "This was the first book I\u2019ve read by Eric Walter, and after hearing such great things about this Canadian author, I decided to give one of his newer books a try. I guess my expectations for this book was a little too high as I was a little disappointed with the book. It got boring at times, and only near the end did it get really good. It wasn\u2019t a bad book though. What I really like is Walter\u2019s writing style; it\u2019s very believable. The book\u2019s plot was done well, though slow at times, and not really focusing on Haiti and the earthquake, but still great. The light shone on Naomi, and her need of getting more insulin, but that\u2019s okay. If there was a girl slowly dying at your feet, begging for insulin, I bet you'd be thinking a lot about getting what she needed; I know I would. So, I understood why Walter focused more on Naomi at parts. After reading some other reviews on this book, I know that this book wasn\u2019t one of his best, so I\u2019ll definitely be reading his other books. I liked the message in the book, but I wish it was a bit longer; I wanted to know more! 3.5 Stars! Doing a book report on this book 7 glad I chose this.;:)"}, {"userName": "Nicholas Dunn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24452048-nicholas-dunn", "userReview": "This book is realistic fiction and it takes place a few years back when the earthquake devastated Haiti. A young teen, Josh, goes to Haiti for helping the poor with his father (before the earth quake hit). But, things take a turn for the worst. The earthquake strikes while the church group is there and kills over a hundred thousand people. Now Josh must find his father and start helping clean up the devastated country. Will Josh make it out alive? Find out by reading Shaken. Personally, I didn't like this book at all because it was too boring and I personally don't really like how religious it was because they prayed every chapter but it did help me learn more about Haiti. I don't recommend this book to anyone, unless they are into books that take a while to get exciting."}, {"userName": "Emily Eskowich", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5240236-emily-eskowich", "userReview": "This was, for me, a good way to learn about the disaster that took place in Haiti, while seeing past the facts regurgitated through countless newscasts and cutting straight down to the very real feelings and emotions that conceivably took place. The unique thing about this novel is that Walters chose to write it not from the viewpoint of a Haitian, but rather from the perspective of a young man visiting with his Church group, Native to north america. This gives readers a good dose of relatability and you also get the background story of how (Josh) is struggling with his Faith after his mother's death, and the very real conflictive emotions he feels toward having to be strong for his father and sister. This book truly has me Shaken to my core."}, {"userName": "Darlene", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6882407-darlene", "userReview": "This was a great book.

Just a couple months after his father takes Josh, his sister Sarah, and a few people from the church on a mission trip to Haiti to help build an orphanage. In this review I will talk about the three fiction elements exposition, climax, and resolution. Then I\u2019ll compare this book to a monomyth. Lastly I\u2019ll talk about the importance of God in this book and in real life. First the exposition Josh and the rest of the mission trip arrive in Haiti.(pg 28) When they get to Haiti they start helping to build a dining hall at the orphanage.(pg 75) The climax the scariest and suspenseful part starts when the earthquake hits.(pg 143) The resolution is Josh, Namoi, and Philippe get to the embassy and find out that Josh's dad and sister are alive and get to go back to Canada. These are all the important events in this book.Second Josh's journey. In Shaken the call to adventure is when Josh and the rest of the mission trip is sent Haiti \u201cAir Canada Flight 950 to Port-au-Prince will begin boarding shortly.\u201d(pg 2) The first threshold is the mission trip boarding the plane. \u201cI threw my backpack into the overhead compartment.\u201d (pg 10) The first abyss is when Sarah Josh\u2019s sister got her bag stolen and Josh chases after the thief and retrieves it luckily the thief didn\u2019t pull out a weapon. \u201cI ran behind the path he ploughed for me.\u201d(pg 41) Abyss Two, when the earthquake hit and Iris and Michelle get trapped under a collapsed building so Josh and Philippe dig them up unfortunately Michelle died. \u201cI looked around. There was no sign of Iris or Michelle\u201d (pg 151). These are some awesome parts from Shaken.The last thing I will explain is very important. How God affects our lives like Josh\u2019s. In our lives we must learn to trust God like Josh did in the book because it God is the reason we live, succeed and sometimes even fail. It is all to make sure we always trust him and he is always the main goal in life. I hope God will make a difference in everyones life at one point.Hopefully you enjoy the book because of the fiction elements and the hero\u2019s journey. I like the way Eric Walters takes a real event and makes a wonderful book out of it. Be sure to get other books by Eric Walters."}, {"userName": "Thomas Norstein", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56326532-thomas-norstein", "userReview": "[The dangers were interesting, and I liked how they shared with the two hungry girls who's mother passed in the earthquake.I also liked Philippe as a character, and the way that Josh refused to enter the embassy without hi was really nice.

Then he goes on a trip to Haiti as a mission lead by his father and along his sister,Sarah.He meets with one of his dad's friend, Pastor Dave. He leads them to an orphanage where they would be staying for the week. First Joshua thinks it would be a waste of time but grows a friendship with a boy named \"Philippe\", a orphan boy same aged as him. But then an earthquake happens at Haiti and Joshua and the other have to survive but when a girl named,\"Naomi\", gets sick and in need of insulin, Josh,Philippe and Naomi have to travel to Port au Prince to get it before it is too late and also to find his missing father and sister.  I chose this book because this book is basically relating to the real natural earthquake that happen in Haiti on Jan.12,2010.This talks about how a trip to Haiti changed a Canadian boy life. I finish this book because this book was my must read book since Gr.6. I loved the books that the author,Eric Walter writes about. His book,Shaken is an incredible book that make the reader wanting to read this book. I would recommend this book to those who are a fan of a Canadian author like Eric Walter or those who likes to read about going into a new place could change a person's life by a lot."}, {"userName": "Alexandre Blackburn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4736095-alexandre-blackburn", "userReview": "Shaken, newest young adult novel from Canadian author Eric Walters. An exceptional inspiring story about courage and hope while faced through horrible circumstances. This book, offers insight in the catastrophic Haitian earthquake, and Joshua, the main character. Fifteen-year-old Josh`s life has been turned completely upside down: his mother died recently and moved away from his life. His father, a minister and several other kids, including his sister travel on a missionary trip to Haiti to help build an orphanage in the Haitian country side. Everyone around him believes in god and that god will help you and be with you no matter what. But the young man has faith issues, losing it and questioning it. But then one night catastrophe hits Haiti-the earthquake. The difficulties of faith and hope really trigger emotional pain for Josh, how will he find the courage and hope to help himself and others. How will Josh ever find faith to understand what has happened. This novel embarks you in a journey of hope and soul searching and how anyone with the right mind set can help others around them. Eric Walters wrote this book with such care and precision that you can picture every word in your mind as if you visited the country yesterday. Shaken, is definitely a book for who ever is ready to be inspired and taken through an incredible adventure."}, {"userName": "Kaithlyn", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5478016-kaithlyn", "userReview": "The book was okay, i did like it :) I felt the tension that I was looking for on the rising action and on the climax. In the last part though, i thought it was a cliff-hanger. The events that was happening in the book made me predict a lot of things that would happen at the end, but i just became disappointed at the last part cause I didn't see what i expected. But overall, the book was good. It's a good book cause you would know what it feels like being stuck on an Earthquake. I also used this book for my book report in school :)I also want to put here my friend's (Bailey's) opinion about this book, and she has a point:\"This book opened my eyes to see the unbelievable and how truly when there is a natural disaster and we hear about it on the radio or on television, and we constantly think about it for a week then it seems to dissipate from our minds and we move on when truly the pain never ends and we feel no pain for others.

Eric Walters is an absolute vulture of an author. I believe he has shells of stories based on different types of natural disasters, and then he just puts in really bland first-world characters who learn Important Lessons and go home happy at the end of the day. I think this type of storytelling is really irresponsible and offensive. It's like that episode of 30 Rock, but for real.

The book helped me learn a lot about Haiti. I was really young when the earthquake happened in Haiti and I didn't realise the extent of the damage that the earthquake brought... Another big issue this book deals with is religion. I'm a \"cradle catholic\" so I can identify with Joshua to some extent. Sometimes when things happen in your life, you tend to wonder if God is still listening or if any higher power is listening or if there is anyone listening at all. Sometimes all you have left is faith. Faith in something. I acknowledge that this book was kind of dry at some parts, but still a great book nonetheless. I suggest you don't read this book if you don't have an open mind about religion (whether you're religious or athiest)."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6101087-elaine", "userReview": "I was so disappointed in this Eric Walters book about the earthquake in Haiti. I liked the idea of a teenage boy going to Haiti on a mission trip with his Dad, sister and a group of volunteers from their church, helping to build an orphanage. However, the doubting of the Bible, the questioning if God is real, the disrespect of prayer, overshadowed the entire story. The character Josh was struggling with his faith but he came across too disrespectful and blasphemous. Even when he came to terms with God's will and how He answers our prayers, there was too much negativity at that point to take his thoughts seriously. Eric Walters had a good idea but the book was too unbalanced."}, {"userName": "Sydney", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5109019-sydney", "userReview": "im only giving this book 2 stars because of nthe fact that the book wasn`t all about Haiti, and the earthquale they endured, it more more about getting Namoi her insulin.
