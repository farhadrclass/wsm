His worlds are hauntingly believable, and surprisingly comforting despite (or perhaps because of) that.In Trader, familiar and beloved characters mix with fantastic newcomers. A man wakes to find his body is no longer his own, and the rest of the story loosely revolves around identity: the finding of your own, and the struggles that come from not knowing who you are - whether you belong in your body or not. It's not as serious as all that, though - or rather, it is serious but told in such a lilting, gentle way that it's almost soothing to read.I always love the intersection of urban life and myth that de Lint creates, and I think here he has managed it perfectly. There are few books whose worlds I would truly like to remain in, but de Lint's Newford is unquestionably one of them."}, {"userName": "Ambrosia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1811588-ambrosia", "userReview": "Charles de Lint is rapidly becoming one of my new favorite authors - frankly, given how long I've enjoyed similar urban fantasists like Neil Gaiman, I can't believe it's taken me this long to come across his stuff. And his handling of this premise makes it slightly horrifying and definitely compelling enough to overcome its slight shop-wear. This particular volume was recommended to me by a fellow musician, as proof of de Lint's fine grasp of what it means to be a musician. I must say, in that sphere especially, I'm very impressed; there's a scene in this book where a normally-placid character sees another character playing an instrument very dear to him, and completely loses his temper at her. It gave me chills; I have little in the way of a temper, myself, but I could see reacting in a similar manner if I were in such a situation.That said, it feels a little rougher than the other (far more recent) book of de Lint's I'd read; less structured, with a lot of philosophy and ideas on the nature of identity that don't quite gel. But I did very much like the theme of living a life so full that there's no room for spirits to get in and work their mischief. One of the themes that goes underexplored in our cultural narrative is how contentment can be as much a trap as despair; if you're more or less happy with how things are going, you're far less likely to stretch yourself and risk upsetting the balance. But eventually that desire not to risk one's happiness turns into a rut, if not an outright prison.And while it didn't really bother me any, I was amused at how often I found myself thinking \"Oh yeah, this book was written in the nineties.\" A teenager without a cell phone (and a mention of a 'cellular telephone' as an unusual accoutrement). A woman dating another woman and being nervous about how her friends and daughter would react to it, even in a major urban area. Several mentions of cassette tapes, or a brick-and-mortar video-rental store. Still a good story, but it definitely took a little bit of mental readjustment every now and then."}, {"userName": "JG (The Introverted Reader)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48404-jg-the-introverted-reader", "userReview": "Max Trader is a luthier who wakes up one morning in a body not his own. After the initial panic and a little further investigation, Trader finds out that charming, womanizing rake, Johnny Devlin, has wished for a different life and somehow they have traded bodies. Devlin has no intention of trying to switch back. He gets a fresh start while Trader tries to navigate his way through the wreckage of Johnny's life. While learning about Johnny, though, Devlin learns a few things about his own life and how he needs to start living as large as trees, to paraphrase. Characters, characters, characters. What draws me to Charles de Lint are his characters, and he did not disappoint with this one. Trader is a mild-mannered kind of guy, mostly forgettable except for his talent, but he's willing to learn from this unbelievable experience he has. He learns to live his life to the fullest and not take a single day for granted.So that one's obvious. What makes this a de Lint book is that even the secondary characters grow and learn and change. Trader and Devlin's switch is like a stone thrown into a still pond: the effects ripple out in ways that you don't see coming. Even minor characters learn self-acceptance, the value of having your own life outside of a relationship, acceptance of others, forgiveness, open-mindedness and all kinds of Important Life Lessons. I've loaned out my copy already or I would throw out a couple of quotes that sum all of this up much better than I can. Expect to see a revised version of this review when I get my copy back. Finally got it back!\"The thing to do is to be happy with yourself, with what's in your own life; then if a relationship comes along it's a bonus, something to enjoy instead of the thing your life revolves around.\"\"Look inside yourself for the answers--you're the only one who knows what's best for you. Everybody else is only guessing.\"What kept this from being five stars are two of the characters who actually grow the most. They were the whiniest women I have read about in a long time. Oh, they felt real alright. I know plenty of women who moan on and on and on about their boyfriends, the lack of, or the fact that they need a life apart from. They are not women I want to spend time with, either in books or in real life. I have very little tolerance for that kind of thing. It's an important lesson to get out there, but spare me. Please. What's a little unusual about this novel is that there isn't really a bad guy. Devlin's not anyone's idea of a nice guy, but the real antagonists are apathy, inertia, missed opportunities, wasted talent, and a lack of self-awareness. Devlin's actually sort of the poster child for the \"wherever you go, there you are\" theme running through the book. He gets a new life, but he's unwilling to change and makes the same old mistakes all over again.This falls pretty early in the Newford books, which I will still maintain that you don't have to read in order, but it was pretty cool to go back and read an early book and see how the regulars were doing back then. I finally know who Tanya is and how she and Geordie meet, and I finally realize that there are hints of Jilly's \nThe Onion Girl (Newford, Book 11)\n trials this early.On a side note, I adore the cover art that John Jude Palancar creates for de Lint's books.Anyway, this is a great example of why Charles de Lint is my favorite author. He tells a great story with an important message without being preachy, all while creating characters who honestly feel like old friends to me at this point. Reading this one has given me the urge to go on a Newford re-reading binge. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94602-kelly", "userReview": "This book was slightly more mature for De Lint. It still brings up his favorite \"don't overlook the spirits in homeless people!\" theme a lot, and his sentimental view points of emos, goths, slackers, and all those other disaffected groups. He finds redemption in them. Which is sweet on some level, but again. He tends to beat it to death. The device for this one is about two vastly different guys who get their bodies swapped and their lives changed. One's a horrible guy and one's a good one. The metaphor about living in a new skin might be heavy, but it's well done. His writing is quality. I may have rolled my eyes, but something caught me about it anyway.

World: De Lint's Newford is magical. It's dense, it's fully fleshed out, and a living breathing character in the story. The depth and tone and lived in feeling of the world is a delight. There are no info dumps, you are in the hands of a master storyteller and the world is awesome. Story: The story on premise has been done so many times and the book recognizes this and even calls itself out. But in the hands of De Lint and the characters and the setting make this so much more. This story is beautiful, is melancholy and it has so much heart it's amazing. The first two thirds of the book is stunning. The last third is beautiful. Characters: The heart of this book. Every character is so beautifully flawed and read. You will instantly fall in love with Max, Zeffy, Nia and everyone. The characters moments are quiet and beautiful, the emotions real and heavy. These characters are perfect. This premise has been done but wow the writing and the execution is perfection.

But that isn't the reason you read this one. You read it because Charles de Lint is a masterful storyteller who creates loveable (and hateable) characters, places you wish you could visit, and has this wonderful way of bringing magic and wonder into the real world in a way that seems completely plausible. I really enjoyed this story. At the risk of spoiling just a little, I must also say that had it ended any other way my review would be one star less for predictability, but it ended perfectly--not neatly, not nicely, but believably, and it was very satisfying.

Despite all of this, I adore his books. He goes so far beyond making up for slight weaknesses in his style that it seems petty to even bring them up. The characters in his books are more like real people I actually know than any other literary characters I've ever encountered, and I feel like he understands and captures the tragic beauty of the human condition in a way that art rarely achieves. His stuff is incredible, and \"Trader\" is no exception.This is a book about Max Trader, a luthier (that's someone who builds guitars) who wakes up one morning in the body of a good-for-nothing wasteoid. The wasteoid, Johnny Devlin, woke up in Max's body too, and now, while Max is having to deal with the fact that Johnny's broke, getting evicted, and in a lot of trouble with his ex-girlfriend, Johnny's busily seeing how quickly he can run Max's life into the ground. The story focuses on Max rather than Johnny, though, and there's a sad beauty in seeing a good person try to deal with a bad hand that he incurred through no fault of his own. There's a much larger metaphor here too, in that a lot of people go through this sort of thing in real life, without any fantastical switching of brains, and also have to pick up the pieces. It made me consider the plight of the homeless in much more detail than I ever had before.There's a lot more to the story, involving Max's teenage neighbor and her mom, Johnny's ex-girlfriend and her musician roommate, and of course, those De Lint mainstays Geordie Riddell and Jilly Coppercorn, who seem to show up in every book he writes (and thank god for that--they are both awesome characters). At the heart of it all, though, is the story of a man who has to figure out who he really is despite losing all outward signs of being that person. De Lint keeps you interested, makes you care--sometimes even about characters that shouldn't be sympathetic at all--and provides some insight about people and how they interact, insight that's well worth taking in and remembering. \"Trader\" is well worth your time."}, {"userName": "Stephen Gallup", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1266077-stephen-gallup", "userReview": "I was casually browsing the book sale table at the library when this title caught my eye. \"Trader\" -- my first thought was that it might be about trading stocks or futures. Picking it up, I realized it was a fantasy -- way over at the other end of the spectrum, although on second thought the ambitions of your average trader probably do border on fantasy. But never mind that. I bought it anyway. Nominally about Max Trader, a renowned but introverted maker of fine guitars, the story shows what happens when, inexplicably, he wakes up one morning in a stranger's body, having somehow traded places overnight with an unsavory guy who is about to be evicted from his apartment.The tale of Max's quest to get back what used to be his, and what he learns along the way, amounts to a rite of passage toward a more authentic life, and I have only minor quibbles about that. However, four other main characters get essentially as much attention in the unfolding narrative as does Max, and that's where the problems lie. The author tells the story in what I think of as \"basket-weaver\" style, by which I mean the chapters alternate from Max to Leffy (an aspiring guitarist who dreams of playing professionally if she can overcome her shyness), Tanya (Leffy's roommate, a talented actress who has stopped acting), Nia (an alienated teenager), and Lisa (Nia's mom, who is preoccupied with the trauma of coming out of the closet). Most chapters conclude with minor cliffhangers, making the switch to another point of view somewhat irksome, but for me the book's basic flaw was that all these other characters are not very interesting. I suppose the idea is that all of them are in the process of learning to live more authentically, but even so their dialog in particular is utterly banal and put me in mind of the kind of mass-market chick-lit you see in grocery stores. I don't like to skim, but I found myself doing that every time these other characters started talking.Aside from that, De Lint is competent at what he does. (He should be, given all the titles to his credit -- nine pages on goodreads. Prolific!) It's escapism, which for me definitely serves a purpose every so often."}, {"userName": "Marie Browne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7953626-marie-browne", "userReview": "This book starts with a good boost for me because I really like the way DeLint writes. Trader is another of his urban fantasy books that brings back a lot of his favourite characters such as Jilly and Geordie but introduces us to some new players as well.As usual the action has a musical/arty theme and his characters tend to be a little boho and 'alternative'.The only reason I'm giving this only three stars is that, in this book, his moral message is delivered with a slightly less subtle hand than usual (in my opinion). The base line of this is that, after some of his other work such as Memory and Dream or Someplace to be Flying this falls a little flat (and as a dyed in the wool De Lint fan that is hard to admit). His conversations seem either preachy or a little wooden and the time spent in the other-world seem rushed and he misses out on a huge opportunity to explore that world with the reader. He says a lot about 'this' is here and 'that' is there but he doesn't say why. In no way can Trader be considered a bad book, it isn't, it's perfectly readable and I don't think anyone will have trouble getting to the end of it, there just wasn't enough depth to it to keep me entirely happy."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/250814-mark", "userReview": "Charles de Lint is probably one of the most brilliant writers at making you feel wretched one minute and then tremendous the next.

Many of his books center around the archetypal town of Newford (which I've always thought of as in Canada, for some reason) where dark and dangerous things always seem to happen.

Also, the quote sums up how one should view art and having it revealed through a character is the best way to bring home a truth.Truth. Identity. Those are the main themes in Trader. Max Trader is a luthier, maker of guitars and has created a comfortable life for himself in the fictional city of Newford. (De Lint has written a series of novels based in Newford and all are worth checking out.) Johnny Devlin is a ne\u2019er-do-well living on the edge in the city. Somehow, both men\u2019s identities get switched and they live life in each other\u2019s bodies. Johnny assumes Max\u2019s life without no trouble. While, Max becomes homeless, poor, friendless, and has to pick up the pieces from his new identity.De Lint does an excellent job in using both first person (for Max) and third person (for Johnny and the other characters) to create a sense of how switching identities would effect both men and the people in their circle of friends. Also, there is several subplots with some of the Newford characters that have appeared various books and a mother and daughter who have lost connection with one another. All the characters were engaging, believable and kept me turning the pages.I have to admit that I was a little disappointed in how De Lint resolved the switching identities of both men as they entered the spirit world based on a combination of Celtic and Native American mythology. I had a different expectation on how that issue would be resolved and De Lint took it in a different direction. Beside that issue, I enjoyed Trader and it brought me back to when I read a lot of De Lint novels in the mid 1990s as a bookseller. It had been a long time since I\u2019ve read a De Lint novel, and it did not disappoint me all these years later.

Most people I\u2019ve spoken with about de Lint\u2019s writing tell me that he\u2019s urban fantasy, so I was waiting for werewolves lurking in the hedges or vampires tromping down the sidewalks, interspersed with more sexual encounters than one could shake a stick at. De Lint does none of this, and I must say: I am so much happier for it. Unlike other novels I\u2019ve read in the urban fantasy genre, de Lint creates a town that is seemingly normal, and changes only thing about it: he takes one man\u2019s soul, and swaps it with another. Trader, the man the book is named after, is a luthier (that is, he crafts guitars). One morning he wakes up and finds that\u2019s he\u2019s not quite himself. On the contrary, he is now in someone else\u2019s body; the body of Johnny Devlin, low-life and lady killer. Trader doesn\u2019t quite know what to believe, and the people around him only see Devlin; while some notice the change in his behavior, they think it\u2019s Devlin\u2019s way of swindling them out of something. Now a man no one trusts, Trader is on his own. This story really struck a chord with me (oh, see what I did there?). Trader at first feels lost, confused, and upset; emotions that, more than likely, any person has felt. Trader evokes a sympathy within the reader; before being body snatched, he had a good, quiet life, making beautiful guitars. After the switch with Devlin, Trader\u2019s life is turned on it\u2019s head; he\u2019s made to clean up the mess this man has made of his existence. In turn, Devlin uses his slippery wiles to attempt to ruin Trader\u2019s life. The book bounces back and forth between character points of view: Trader and Devlin; Nia and her mother, Lisa, who are Trader\u2019s upstairs neighbors; Zeffy and her roommate, Tanya, who are two women Devlin knows. The switching of the souls touches all of these lives, and a few others that we don\u2019t hear from directly, and changes them. All in all, I definitely enjoyed this story. De Lint doesn\u2019t wait to get into the action; by the end of the first chapter, the souls of Devlin and Trader have been switched, and things are starting to fall apart. I was intrigued right from the beginning, and the book didn\u2019t let me go until the very end. I was told by a good friend that this book is a good introduction to de Lint, and I couldn\u2019t agree more.

It's been on my bookshelf for years, and I've always known I would love it. But for some reason I kept reading only the first few pages, and when I'd see it in my shelves would remember how glorious they were. I kept wanting a \"perfect\" time to read it - just as I did with Wuthering Heights (which I kept thinking of as a \"winter book\" and eventually read in mid-summer). Similarly, I finally read Trader not during a season I'd picked (I always thought fall would be a good time, and in a cold place), but when I came home from break and didn't feel like buying something new at the bookstore.I wasn't disappointed. This gets five stars. I'd forgotten how important it was to me as a kid to find a book that had an engrossing plot, and now I remember why I loved mystery stories so much. I felt impatient to finish; I wanted to know what happened. I was mad I couldn't find out quickly enough. I read it whenever I could, but I read slowly; his writing and his world were just too beautiful to speed through. My only, only complaint isn't really about the book, but I noticed more than a few mistakes that a copy editor should have picked up. Sometimes there was no pronoun antecedent, other times a completely missing comma or period. Just things that stopped the flow a little bit, but made me feel more affection for de Lint, I think, as I was reminded that he was a real person giving me this story. I loved de Lint's urban fantasy world, the city of Newford (so blessedly pre-Information Age, and anonymous), and the skill and sympathy he used with his characters. I want to read everything by him. This made me feel more hopeful about the world, about people, about the beauty in cold and lonely things and how little and how much we need to be happy (completely contradictory statement, I know). Magic. (And ahhhh - just saw that his Newford series concerns the same characters. So excited to return to them again.)"}, {"userName": "Andrew Dyer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4879864-andrew-dyer", "userReview": "This book was intresting and keeped my intrest through out the whole book. This book out of most I have read really gave me a suprise through out the story with not only looking through the life of Leonard Trader but the different perspectives of other chaters as the story played out. \"trader\" realy gets enjoying to read whihle looking at a situation of a person how has swithed bodys with someone else and brings in other perceptions as you coutinue to read.Mostly Lenard Trader was try to find a way back to his own life and life style but, once he meets his body with Johnny Devlin inhabating it he soon come into a comfrintation/relization that shows his inabelity to find a solution with this person for loosing his body to him has caused the Johnney to exept this fate for he had ruind his other life and now has a great oppertunitey to starte over,which inturn means he will not give up this chance and try to set things right. After this scean we move to some one else perspective to let the readers mind settle and allow for some time to bring in other characters into the story but, soon come back to Trader to see what his new step whould be after having no clue how this all came to be and what to do next.The story is mosty about trader and him thinck about what he lost and coming to a relization to what he done in his life. He soon finds that even though he was living pretty well he was empty inside for he realy did not have much connection with others. This story then shows the people closses to him or will be in the future and there struggels or life challages in which show there sruggles ifn life and what they face.I was glade this book had a surreal parts at the end because it just showed the cosaquences of some one greedy and evil even if it was shortly talked about. This book is a good read to anyone."}, {"userName": "Isabel (kittiwake)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7038421-isabel-kittiwake", "userReview": "When Max Trader wakes up in the body of Johnny Devlin, a man he has never met, he can not believe that his comfortable life has been usurped by a loser who is just about to get evicted for non-payment of rent. But Max lives in Newford where the threshold of the world of spirits that most people only visit in their dreams is easily breached, and the street people are closer to the liminal zone than most, so when he finds himself living in a park with a stray dog, his new friends and the real Johnny's not so friendly acquaintances help him come to terms with what has happened and decide what to do about it.One thing that has sometimes irritated me about Charles de Lint is the idea that apart from street people it is only creative types like artists and musicians who are going to have otherworldly experiences. In this book however, although Max Trader is a master craftsman, a successful and well-respected luthier, it is not the creative side of his life that left him vulnerable to the body swap, but his social isolation and lack of connection with other people. The charming but feckless Johnny Devlin just went to bed wishing that his problems would all go away, and once he had Max's comfortable apartment and his bank accounts, he didn't want to let them go.I thought that this book was a bit too long and could have done with having a few less characters; if the author had thought up a different way for Nia to meet up with the real Max, he could have dispensed with Nia's mother Lisa and her relationship with Julie altogether. I found them the least convincing characters, and leaving out their story would probably have knocked 50 or so pages off the length."}, {"userName": "Steve Haywood", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7313771-steve-haywood", "userReview": "Max Trader is a successful luthier - a master guitar maker - with a quiet, relatively contented life.

Devlin quickly and gleefully sets up in Trader's life, while Trader - friendless, penniless and about to be homeless, attempts to reclaim some semblence of his former life...[return][return]Bodyswopping - a tired, worn out science fiction cliche you might say. But this book is actually rather good. It's the first Charles De Lint book I've read, and first and foremost I was very impressed with the quality of his writing. The language is quite evocative, he doesn't just describe things, he lets you see them, feel them, smell them. The characters are very well drawn, you quickly find yourself liking them, understanding them, and feeling for them when things go badly. The plot is probably the weakest point of the book, slow at times with not a lot happening, but then this story is very character orientated, and it's what happens to them that matters most to the reader, not a grand over-arching plot.[return][return]I've given this book 4 our of 5.

One is that I'm very keen on plot-driven novels, and the second is that there are books that I've enjoyed a lot more, and I need some way to differentiate between them."}], "description": "A novel of loss, identity, and, in the strangest of places, hope.Max Trader is a luthier, a maker of guitars.
