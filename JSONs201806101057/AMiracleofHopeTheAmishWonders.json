Lately stories in the genre have evolved into more than just stories of the simple life, in peaceful little communities in Ohio and Pennsylvania to Florida and the western reaches of the United States. Not only have the settings changed, but I've found that they've become even more romantic! Authors like Shelley Shepard Gray, Kelly Long, and now Ruth Reid have really amped up it up when it comes to the love stories between the couples in their books and I for one love it! There's nothing boring about these books and I've found most to be a lot more unique and interesting than any other books in the Christian fiction genre.The latest Plain tale, A Miracle of Hope, although not the first book by author Ruth Reid, is the first story of her's that I have read and I'm happy to say, it's a winner! I'm a sucker for marriage of convenience stories and this one hooked me from the first. Lindie was a sweet, shy character, who didn't really have a say in the matter of moving to a new state to marry a virtual stranger. It was nice to see her come out of her shell in spite of the continuing heartaches that she faces as the story comes to a peak. Josiah Plank is a gentle soul suffering through the loss of his wife as well as a secret burden that will affect his newly formed family in ways he could never imagine. Josiah and Lindie each captured my heart. It's been a while since I had a vested interest in what happens to characters so this book was a welcome change! I only hope it doesn't ruin the other two Amish stories that I'll be reading this month.A Miracle of Hope is sweet romance at its finest. The journey to love, from strangers to partners facing life's travails, is too good to miss, especially for Amish fiction fans. I was pleasantly surprised by this book and I won't hesitate to pick up the next book in the series. It will be worth the read if it's half as good as this one! ~ My Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars ~*I receive complimentary books for review from the publisher. I am not required to write positive reviews.

I think it has to be the best Amish fiction that I've read this year so far! :)I was really captivated by Lindie's story from the first page! I was impressed by this book I can tell y'all right now! lol. The story does have drama and very interesting situations which made it all the more desirable to read by the moment. This is the first book by Ruth Reid that I've read and I was very intrigued by how well she wrote this story.Josiah Plank was a very sweet hero! The romance wasn't mushy. The worst thing I can't stand in a book is very mushy romance! The romance was handled very well in this book.The book is true to its name and it's truly miraculous! If you ever read it you'll understand why! I had never seen that written in a christian novel before. I thoroughly enjoyed most of the characters in the book. I believe that the author did a very good job with the character development and plot. I really liked the theme of a marriage of convenience throughout the story. For some reason I'm drawn to mail order brides and marriages of convenience. To me it was a pretty clean and decent book with the theme of marriage of convenience as the plot. I really commend the author keeping it that way because all I want is to read a very entrancing story and I don't need the unnecessary details!I need to include that there were some situations in this book may be a bit mature because it does deal with her situation of her being with child before she's kinda forced into a marriage of convenience. I though it was dealt with very well in my opinion but some readers may not feel comfortable reading about it. Whatever works for you!I commend the author of this book for holding the reins very well in the way of romance while delivering a very sweet and touching story! I thoroughly enjoyed this story!!! I also loved the book cover vibrant and different! I highly recommend this book if you're looking for an Amish read. I'm certainly looking forward to more books by Ruth Reid!"}, {"userName": "Nancee", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5786956-nancee", "userReview": "Young, unwed and pregnant, Lindie was scorned in her community, and her brother arranged for her marriage of convenience to his best friend. Josiah's first wife had died suddenly, leaving him to raise his young daughter alone. Born deaf, Josiah's daughter needed someone to look after her, and Josiah needed a helpmate to run the household. Lindie's brother escorted her by bus from Ohio to the North Woods of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. After her initial meeting with Josiah he announced his feelings regarding the marriage. \"I'm nett capable of falling in love again. Your bruder is mistaken if he's told you otherwise. Even in time, I won't.\" Isolated and far from home and family, loneliness and a sick stomach were Lindie's constant companions throughout the days. A life of despair lurked as she worked through the details of her life.Ruth Reid is a new author to me. I must say that she has a new fan! This is a book that I couldn't put down, even when I should have been asleep. The hours flew by as I read the story of Lindie, Josiah and Hannah, a withdrawn and shy 8-year-old. The obstacles and complications that stemmed from previous events evident in their relationship made for a compelling story. The author's expression \"cabin fever\" when relating to Michigan winters is authentic. Those of us who are lifelong residents of the state can attest to that fact. The isolation and weather conditions described in the North Woods are factual, and when applied to Lindie's circumstances imparted her sense of desertion. The author has a gift for creating characterizations with a depth of feeling throughout their development. Hope, faith and forgiveness are deeply ingrained in this story. I highly recommend this author of Amish fiction. A Miracle of Hope was beautifully scripted!Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from LitFuse Publicity Group in exchange for my honest review.

I have become much more discriminating in my tastes concerning this genre, and authors with whom I am not familiar don't generally get and easy 5-star rating. And as I began reading this book, I wasn't too taken with Ruth Reid's writing style. It was hard to follow, and I thought that the story may not be all the intriguing. But I continued to read with an open mind.Once I realized the difficult issues both Josiah and Lindie had to face, I found my interest growing immeasurably. Rape and cancer are hot topics even in today's post-modern society, but when placed within the Amish framework, it is even more intense. Throw in a deaf/mute child and arranged marriage without love and you have a recipe for potential disaster. But all the reader needs to do is read the title to get an inkling of how the book ends. I actually shed a few tears on the last pages because I wasn't sure if the book ended as I felt it should have. I was quite relieved to read the last page!As to the Christian message, it is strong and real. Both Josiah and Lindie learn to trust God in everything, and I believe that is why the book concluded as it did. The gospel message is not there in so many words, but the reader can find true inspiration and reliance on God encouraged and rewarded.I was sent a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.

I loved the two main characters, Lindie and Josiah. Lindie was just so obviously lost and overwhelmed with her situation, but she still tried to be the best wife in name only she could be to Josiah. And Lindie struggled so much with his daughter, Hannah, but she was determined to do the best by her that she could.Josiah caught my heart from the beginning. He was dealing with so much from the past few years. The death of his wife, the death of his mother, and a daughter who seemed to have retreated into her own little world. I loved that he was very clear about what this marriage would entail, but then ended up being a very caring man towards Lindie.The progression of events in this book was perfect. The way Josiah and Lindi dealt with each other, and the way in which their feelings slowly changed seemed very authentic. I can say the same thing about Hannah\u2019s progression as well. There was not a magic solution to how she reacted to things. It was gradual and seemed very realistic.If you are a fan of Amish fiction, and have not read this book, I highly recommend it.

Here goes. I think this is probably the best book that Ruth has written, I have enjoyed all her books that I have read to this point, but this book was the best of them all. Don't get me wrong the other books were good, but this one just stood out for me. I enjoyed the storyline, I thought her writing was crisp and clear, and she told the story wonderfully. A great book, with a great ending. (that I wont give any spoilers on.) I loved Lindie, and I also got exasperated by her unwillingness to open up and share what had happened to her. My heart broke for Hannah, and I wanted to take all her hurts away, just a young child with so much hurt in her life, loosing her mother, and now a new change. Great storyline, and I loved the sitting too. I love Michigan, and the UP was a great setting for this story. Overall I give this book 5 stars.

This incredibly heartwarming romance is beautifully written with a compelling storyline but it is the extraordinary cast of characters that completely stole my heart.Unmarried and pregnant, Lindie Wyse is out of options when she agrees to an arranged marriage with her brother's friend, Josiah Plank. Starting over in a new community with an older husband is difficult but Lindie is determined to be a good wife and mother to Josiah's daughter, Hannah. Her feelings about her pregnancy are ambivalent and she is struggling to bond with her unborn child. Lindie's new life is also complicated by her inability to communicate with Hannah and her uneasiness around her new husband. In the beginning, Lindie is quite shy and timid. She is also very reluctant to discuss her past and the circumstances surrounding her pregnancy. She is undergoing a slight crisis of faith as she tries to understand God's plan for her and her baby. Lindie tries to be an obedient wife but she does not hesitate to voice her opinions where Hannah is concerned. She lets her instincts guide her relationship with her young stepdaughter and Hannah soon begins to flourish under Lindie's care. Still deeply mourning the death of his wife Caroline, Josiah never thought he would remarry but he agrees to a marriage of convenience for Hannah's sake. Amid his growing concern for Lindie's health and that of her unborn baby, Josiah is shocked by the realization that he is beginning to fall in love with his young wife. Conflicted by his unexpected feelings for Lindie and his loyalty to Caroline, Josiah must figure out how to move forward with his life. Josiah is kind, caring and compassionate. He takes a gentle approach with Lindie, but he is quite firm when it comes to matters of her health. Although he has strict ideas about how he wants Hannah raised, he does listen to Lindie and changes his stance on a few of his viewpoints. Josiah is at first reluctant to give in to his feelings for Lindie and he finds it difficult to reconcile his need for her with his desire to keep his love alive for his first wife. Just as things are finally coming together for Josiah and Lindie, an unforeseen health issue threatens their future. The community rallies around the couple and provides them some much needed assistance as they face this difficult battle. Josiah is accepting of their fate but Lindie's faith refuses to let her give up and she rises to the challenge facing them.A Miracle of Hope exemplifies everything I love about Amish novels: a slower paced, simpler life, community support and strong beliefs. Ruth Reid takes all of these essential ingredients, adds in some complications that take faith and love to overcome and the resulting story is heartfelt, emotional and most importantly, believable. An incredible journey of love and faith that I hated to see come to an end and leaves me eagerly anticipating the next installment of The Amish Wonders series."}, {"userName": "Jalynn Patterson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8725733-jalynn-patterson", "userReview": "About the Book:Lindie Wyse is pregnant out of wedlock and thinks an arranged marriage is the only way to preserve her future. Josiah Plank is certain he'll never love again, but he needs someone to care for his eight-year-old daughter, Hannah. The two take on their arrangement tentatively at first but soon realize they are each in for more than they imagined.Lindie experiences a breakthrough with Hannah when she recognizes Hannah's special gifts, but a risky pregnancy and serious health issues threaten to demolish the foundation Josiah and Lindie are building. Will their growing love survive despite their struggles, or will their hearts become as cold as the northern winter?About the Author:Ruth Reid is a CBA and ECPA best-selling author of the Heaven on Earth series. She's a full-time pharmacist who resides in Florida with her husband and three children.My Review: What fear young Lindie must of felt as she met with her soon to be husband. An arranged marriage indeed, one that she was not only prepared for but was one that was sprang on her just days prior to meeting Josiah. Not only was she nervous about this whole arrangement but she was so far from her home&family, and in a new district all complete with morning sickness.  Poor Lindie doesn't really know what to think or how to feel about this man that has taken upon himself to help her out of the \"fix\" she is in, especially when it seems that they are getting closer and closer emotionally. She soon finds herself falling for Josiah and his daughter Hannah. Hannah is such a presence in this story even though she is deaf and not too accepting of Lindie at first. Soon you can start to see where the three of them come together as a family. The story is action filled from the very beginning and throughout the book I just couldn't bring myself to put it down. I love the constant banter that starts to develop between the two main characters. I was very irritated by the father in law of Josiah's that was actually his former wife's father. I feel that he was holding Lindie to as standard that she wasn't able to achieve because noone can love them like Caroline did, that was a given. I think Lindie surprised them all including herself.

You feel like you know the characters. With Lindie, sensing her unease, desire to start over, and more (can't tell you!). I understood Josiah's need to fill a hole in his family, without considering the whole of his heart. Speaking of hearts, mine ached for little Hannah. I felt Simon's struggle with the loss of his daughter and this new woman stepping into her life.Lindie is lost, Josiah is broken. What happens when these two come together in an arranged marriage? Is the love growing between them enough? Or will their ever after need A Miracle of Hope.While it could have easily fallen into traditional plot lines and become uninteresting, it didn't. I guessed a few things early on but it didn't detract from the story in anyway. Would I recommend this book? Absolutely! I sat down to read this book one night, and before I knew it I was half done. I spend the next day counting down the hours until I could get home and finish it. Which I did. It's a great book for fans of Amish fiction, stories of arranged marriages in modern times, finding hope and more.

She had no idea what she would do to support herself and her unborn child until her brother, Eli, had the idea of an arranged marriage. Was it what she wanted?

In this first book, a young woman has a marriage arranged by her brother who doesn\u2019t know what happened one night when his sister didn\u2019t come right home after the singing gathering. When Lindie turned up pregnant, her brother arranged for her to leave Ohio and marry a complete stranger in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.At first Lindie and Josiah enter marriage as a commitment with boundaries that only these two know about. The closer it comes to Lindie\u2019s due date the more Josiah looks sickly and is afraid a past illness has resurfaced. Now, will they both enter these trials believing God can heal and deliver them or will their faith crumble?I really was captivated by the story and eagerly anticipate reading the next two books in the series. While the following book isn\u2019t tied together to book one by characters, it takes place in the same area. Book two is titled, A Woodland Miracle followed by book three, A Dream of Miracles.I really like being able to sit back and read a good tale for hours without having to filter some aspects I read in other books. I have been to the UP in Michigan and it is beautiful, and I am sure very cold as portrayed in the novel when winter comes.

Josiah makes it clear to Lindie that he will not love her and he will not give her children not knowing that she is already pregnant and that her shy and timid nature has more to do with the circumstances surrounding her pregnancy than her personality. After all, Lindie is more than willing to push back when it comes to helping her step-daughter deal with her grief and wayward nature.The Amish aspects of this novel are more undertones than central to the novel. It very easily could have been placed in the past and written as a mail-order bride novel than an Amish one. And one aspect of the plot is contradictory to everything I\u2019ve learned about Amish culture. Hannah loves coloring like most young girls and Lindie recognizes her talent for drawing advocating that Josiah purchase colored pencils and paintbrushes for the little girl. I could have believed that the Amish community would have allowed Hannah to draw and color given that it is one of her forms of communication, but the addition of an Amish family to one of her drawings goes against the Amish ban on creating graven images. And yet neither Lindie, Josiah, or Hannah\u2019s grandfather, who is a minister in the community, has anything but praise for Hannah\u2019s drawing, which bugged me throughout the novel.Even so, I enjoyed all the main characters in this book because they are so well-written and each one has a back story to be explored in the novel. Although I figured out Lindie\u2019s secret within the first few chapters, I still found myself waiting with baited breath for her to tell Josiah. Perhaps the plot becomes too emotional; I could have lived without the second medical crisis.

Poor Lindie \u2013 forced into an arranged marriage in a completely different state, also means a completely district and leaving behind everything to become instant step-mom to Josiah\u2019s deaf 8 year old daughter. Talk about a way to begin a story! Josiah and Lindie have a lot of emotional baggage that they must overcome in order to become the family that Hannah and Lindie\u2019s child needs. There quite a few twists, one of which I figured out quite early on about Lindie\u2019s pregnancy but some of the twists took me by surprise, some were sad and some were happy but through it all Lindie and Josiah grow together.While this is a Christian/Amish romance it\u2019s not a typical one as the couple is usually already in love \u2013 this one shows how two people who know nothing about each other, if they allow God to be at the center of their relationship, can become one with each other. There are moments of tenderness but nothing that made me uncomfortable to read, but since Lindie and Josiah are married if they had kissed more I wouldn\u2019t have an issue with it. I would have liked the growth of their relationship to sort of slow down, while it was great and the plot well developed it seemed that they wrapped everything up in a neat, tidy package too quickly.I truly enjoyed this book and as I said above I look forward to reading more of Ruth\u2019s works as I became quickly caught up in the world of these characters and it was a quick read that I enjoyed in an afternoon.

It won't be the last! My interest was piqued partly because this book takes place in Michigan, where I live, and I hadn't realized there were any Amish settlements in the Upper Peninsula. It also didn't seem to follow the usual pattern of Amish fiction (this book centers around a marriage of convenience). But as I read, I noticed parallels to another book I enjoyed where a widower struggles to raise a traumatized, mute daughter, and whose hearts are unlocked by an unexpected love (\"A Promise for Miriam,\" by Vannetta Chapmen). I was also sometimes reminded of Laura Ingalls Wilder's \"A Long Winter.\"The characters in this book grabbed my interest, and I only wished they ALL had more room to develop. My other disappointment was the pacing of the book. Some scenes were quite detailed, while others seemed to grab more pages than they deserved. Some aspects of the story were skipped over too quickly or omitted altogether. I would have liked more details of everyday life in this U.P. settlement, or the ripening love between Lindie and Josiah, and the \"thawing\" of his daughter, Hannah, and his father-in-law, Simon. Instead, strained relationships and health problems alike seem to suddenly and miraculously heal.What I did like was the way the book was woven around Lindie's unwanted pregnancy. I could certainly identify with her morning sickness! I liked the non-typical marriage that Lindie and Josiah forged, and the honesty that eventually helped their love for each other grow. Reid's writing is gentle and natural, interspersed with authentic Amish words and phrases that fit together like corners on a quilt. I feel this is a good book, well-worth your time to read. I look forward to finding more of Ruth Reid's books SOON!"}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18935266-maria", "userReview": "A Miracle of Hope is the first book in The Amish Wonders series by Ruth Reid. The two main characters were complex, realistic, and extremely likable. Even though I haven't been through what they have, the author portrayed their emotions so well I could feel their angst as they tried to keep looking to God amidst their pain.Feeling unloved and unwanted, Lindie Wyse, agrees to her brother's proposal to marry a widower in far away Michigan. What will her betrothed think when he finds out she is three months pregnant?The only reason Josiah Plank agreed to Eli Wyse's arrangement was for the sake of his deaf, eight year old daughter, Hannah. Determined to make Lindie understand that she will be forever trapped in a loveless marriage, Josiah makes it clear that their marriage will be in name only. When Lindie still agrees to marry him, they get married that day. Lindie begins to feel overwhelmed with all the challenges of being newly wed. Learning sign language, dealing with a disgruntled child, morning sickness, running the house, and becoming adjusted to a new community are only some of the myriad problems she has to face. Meanwhile, Josiah has his own issues to deal with one of which is a persistent cough. As they navigate their many problems, they come to rely on each other more than they ever thought they could. How can Josiah possibly love Lindie when even her fiance couldn't? I could not put this book down and read it in a couple of days. It was just sooo good! I was pulled in right from the get go so be prepared for a reading frenzy. haha I think Lindie was the best part of the book. She seemed so normal with how she was dealing with her pregnancy and marriage, and I loved the focus of this book on trusting in God no matter the circumstances. What a great story of how God can redeem anything!I was given this book free from Booksneeze in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Krystal", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5250533-krystal", "userReview": "DISCLAIMER: I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. This has not affected my review in any way, all opinions contained in this review are my own. I offered to read this book for a friend of mine for her blog, and I figured that even though this isn't my normal genre of reading, the premise was something that I thought I would enjoy. Thankfully, A Miracle of Hope certainly delivered on that. Right off the bat, I was intrigued by each and every one of these characters. I wanted to know what secrets they were hiding, and if their relationship would develop into more than just a \"marriage of convenience\" between two people who seemingly didn't want this at all. As the story unfolded, and more details came to light about their pasts, I couldn't help but feel as though I knew them. I worried for them. I laughed with them. I even cried with them. One of the things I most liked about this novel was the fact that it wasn't your run of the mill \"two people meet, immediately fall in love despite their circumstances and live happily ever after\" type of book. They each had completely different obstacles that they had to overcome, and for a long while, I wasn't sure if they would be able to indeed overcome the obstacles placed before them.Throughout this novel the presence of God is prevalent, and their unyielding faith in Him even when things looked their darkest was refreshing, and apologetically honest. A Miracle of Hope is a clean, page turning romance full of hope, love and second chances in the face of odds that are very unfavorable. Each of the characters brings something different to the table, which made it decidedly easy to fall in love with them.Overall, I was unfamiliar with Ruth Reid, and her works to date, but she has definitely found a new fan in me! I cannot wait to read more by this author!"}, {"userName": "Deborah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16793358-deborah", "userReview": "She\u2019s heard about forgiveness all her life, but how far does God\u2019s mercy truly reach?Lindie Wyse thinks an arranged marriage is the only way to preserve a future for herself and her unborn child.

I sympathized with Lindie throughout the whole book, because here she is, a woman with a child in her belly, no husband, and no one to love her. Her brother's friend offers to marry her, but all he needs is a housewife and mother for his eight year old deaf daughter.Things go well after a time, but inevitably, they go terribly wrong as well. I enjoyed the roller coaster ride through their lives, and how just when they think life is finally settling down, something always popped up. It was a page turning Amish romance, which I attribute primarily to the fact that Reid makes this novel so different than everything out there in the genre. It was an excellent read, and something I recommend to lovers of Amish fiction, as well as those who are on the fence about giving the genre a second chance.

I did not know what to expect since I'm not an Amish fiction expert and have never read a book by this author previously. I thoroughly enjoyed this story! I love marriage-of-convenience storylines but this plotline is hard to find in contemporary books. However, the author did an excellent job setting this plotline in a contemporary Amish setting. Lindie and Josiah were realistic and admirable characters. Lindie's brother arranges a marriage for her once he learns she is pregnant (after she stays out one night). Josiah is a widower with a deaf 8 year old daughter, Hannah. He loved his first wife but he needs to re-marry so someone could care for his prone-to-wander daughter while he is working. In a letter to Lindie, Josiah writes that he will give her his name but not his heart. But how he ends up taking back those words! Their love story was believable and a joy to watch---2 strangers falling in love slowly and completely. Both Lindie and Josiah experienced great tragedy and both were exactly what each other needed. Even though the marriage and the obstacles that arose were difficult, Josiah and Lindie were committed to the marriage. Hannah was also a sweet girl with a special gift of healing and foresight. I enjoyed the writing, I felt all the emotions from the characters and felt compelled to keep reading to see what happens. There is a strong spiritual message that God works everything out for His glory. Even though Lindie thought God was doing one thing, it turned out He had an even better plan. It was a great reminder of how what man meant for evil, God could turn to good. I also love the book cover. I think it captures exactly how Lindie was described and even the deer in the background is significant. Overall, I highly recommend this book!"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2521894-laura", "userReview": "Title: A MIRACLE OF HOPEAuthor: Ruth ReidPublisher: Thomas NelsonDecember 2013ISBN: 978-1401688295Genre: AmishShe\u2019s heard about forgiveness all her life, but how far does God\u2019s mercy truly reach?Lindie Wyse thinks an arranged marriage is the only way to preserve a future for herself and her unborn child.

Read Miracle of Hope by Ruth Reid and find out!A quick moving plot really pulled me right into this story, but it was the depth of the characters, and the ease in which I connected with them that kept me reading to see what would ultimately happen in this story. Learning the backstories of these characters provided so many layers allowing a true glimpse at who they were and the life events that had shaped them into the people they were, but it was the trials that they continued to face that made me hope for a positive outcome for this Amish family. While I connected with Lindie, it was the story of Josiah and his young daughter Hannah that really touched my heart. The author deals with a few subjects that isn't always touched on in \"Amish\" fiction and for me this made the story more realistic. Fans of Amish fiction will love this one, but I recommend this story to anyone looking for a bit of inspiration where you can't help but hope for the best outcome for the characters in the story.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review."}, {"userName": "Abbie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4270443-abbie", "userReview": "Lindie is single and pregnant.

Josiah can't believe he has agreed to marry Lindie what had he been thinking? As Lindie settles into his home he finds himself caring for her yet serious health issues threaten to undo everything. This is book one in a new series by Ruth Reid. This book deals with unwed pregnancy and cancer yet still keeps a positive tone. It\u2019s a well written book.What I liked: Both Lindie and Josiah were good characters. I liked how they both had depth and their was more to their story then what the initial information showed. I felt bad for Lindie and what she had gone through and the fact she had to marry yet Josiah showed her compassion.What I did not like: I was a little confused about Josiah\u2019s daughter and her gift. It seemed to play a big part of the plot yet it seemed surrounded with mystery. Even at the end of the book I was left scratching my head a little not feeling like it was explained very well. Overall this was a well written book and I really enjoyed it. It has a darker feel to it dealing with both Lindies pregnancy and Josiah\u2019s illness yet both characters remain strong throughout the book. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.

I LOVE THIS BOOK!!! Ruth is a great writer that has come up with an excellent plot and a great set up. This is the first book from her that I've read and I'm hooked! If I didn't want to read her other books before (which I did LOL!) I sure do now!!! From the beginning this book had me hooked! I didn't want to put it down. The whole concept is great. The secrets that come out are shocking and the whole journey is amazing. It is a story with Faith, hope, love, fear, pain, healing, secrets, miracles, and understanding. Lindie is a fabulous character strong and brave, I LOVE Josiah he is everything a husband and dad should be, and I love Hannah a child wise beyond her years yet so innocent and sweet! I love how they rise above hardships as their Faith grows. The messages are great, from God's faithfulness, unending love, and mercy to His's will and plan always being far better than we could have ever realized.
