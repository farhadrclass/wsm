You know, the Hallmark show? The Christian historical romance that borders on cheesy where everything always turns out okay? Yeah, that\u2019s the one. It\u2019s one of my favorites. In this show, community is about celebrating together in the good times and supporting each other through the hard times. Faith in God is the norm, and that faith actually means something. And love always finds a way. The show idyllic and wholesome and just makes me really happy every time I watch it. It\u2019s my visual comfort food.Last week, Chris and I very unexpectedly became foster parents for two little boys. A couple of days ago, they just as suddenly returned home to their mom. Our emotions during this time went haywire; we were terrified because we\u2019ve never been parents and didn\u2019t know what to do, we were thrilled with the boys themselves and fell in love with them despite our efforts not to get attached, and we were a weird mix of devastated (for us) and relieved (for them) when they went home so soon. When they left and our house felt just the slightest bit hollow, I needed to disappear into a book. But the books I\u2019m reading currently, while they\u2019re great books, they were darker than what I needed. So I decided to read the book that inspired my favorite feel-good show.The book wasn\u2019t perfect. It was stilted and felt a tad forced in places. It was different from the show that I\u2019ve come to love, even though they shared a common name and framework. But it was exactly what I needed when I picked it up. It was short and sweet and full of love and hope and Jesus. Though Christian historical fiction is not one of my favorite genres, it\u2019s what I tend to turn to whenever I\u2019m going through a rough patch in my life. I love how unapologetic the characters are about their faith, and how that faith permeates their lives. I also love how faith is just an expected aspect of life in these bygone eras. And in the vast majority of the books in this genre, you go in knowing that everything is going to turn out okay, and that a happy ending is almost inevitable. Janette Oke provided me with exactly what I needed here. It gave me some of the hope I needed when I wasn\u2019t feeling all that hopeful. Even though I enjoy the show more than I did this book, I\u2019ll probably continue with the series at some point.

This is a typical Christian romance. The gorgeous heroine, the gorgeous hero, the cliche emotions and phrases, and the unoriginal conversations about God and faith. For a while, I thought I would like it, because Elizabeth had some spirit and she wasn't perfect. But as soon as she fell in love with that Wynn, pfft - end of the good stuff. From then on it was crying and pining and frustration and all those klutzy moments that are supposed to make you sigh at the romance. I found it absolutely amazing that, even though Wynn is a Canadian Mountie and supposedly \"married\" to his job, he still finds the time to be EVERYWHERE Elizabeth is, even though she skips from Calgary to Pine Springs every other chapter. And he always shows up at the right moments too. When she's in trouble, Wynn is always there. To fix her stove, to carry her when she \"sprains\" her ankle, to drive her home from church, to buy her box lunch (which, I should add is one of the most overused settings in Christian romance. If you want to have romance, just stage a box lunch fundraiser and have the love-interest bid up a storm), and to kiss her so she doesn't faint. Yes, you read that right, folks. Elizabeth runs into a bear on the way home from a student's house, she promptly faints and is rescued from a certain mauling by Wynn, who conveniently shows up to carry her out of danger (gag). Then, when he perceives that she looks rather pale, he kisses her to take her mind off the bear. She then misunderstands his apology for his sudden action and runs off in the direction OF THE BEAR. Makes sense, no?And then, when they go sledding and she twists her ankle slightly, Elizabeth pretends that she can't walk only to have an excuse to rest her cheek against his broad, red-coated chest after he gently swoops her up. The next day she admits her deceit and realizes that when Wynn checked her ankle HE lied and said it was injured so that he would have an excuse to carry her. Nothing like a relationship built on mutual deceit, eh? Then there were all those times when Elizabeth fell, tripped, or did some other clumsy thing (unintentionally, these times) so that Wynn was forced to catch her, steady her, or hold her. Cliche, I say. It seemed to me that for a schoolteacher, who was impressed upon me as intelligent enough for her chosen career, should not be able to figure out the things that I knew for a fact as soon as they were mentioned. Honestly, Elizabeth was so slow. She sits there and puzzles things out until you want to shake her. Is it so hard to believe that a man who paid 10+ dollars for your lunch, puts up with all your klutziness, lies in order to carry you a few feet, solicitously kisses you so that you do not faint, and always turns up at every tense moment to rescue you, could possibly be in LOVE with you? Apparently Elizabeth, who can teach kids from kindergarten to high school, cannot grasp these obvious things that are staring her in the face. *sigh* All in all, a quick, mindless read that did not make me laugh, cry or learn (three things the back of the book advised I should do), so I suppose it was mostly wasted time. I will, however, read the sequel to see if it can make me laugh, cry and rejoice, though I have small faith in its ability to do so."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9871824-ashley", "userReview": "**These books aren't anywhere near as amazing and profound as SGW's Prairie Winds trilogy, but I love them anyway!**Its been years since I've read these, but I have definitely read them a few times.

It is a shorter read, and while nothing is unpredictable, the setting and characters hold a lot of charm. I was surprised (happy) to see that it was written in first-person because that is not done very often inspirational fiction. The plot flowed well, and I appreciated the look into such a secluded and wild place. I've always found the life of teachers during this time period fascinating, and Elizabeth was a kindred spirit of sorts, with her tea-drinking and book-reading. It's easy to see why readers liker her. She has great voice; the only thing that bugged me was when the love interest came on the scene, she suddenly lost her wits (not just on their first meeting either), and that was annoying to me when she was so independent and adventurous in other ways. But even that I could overlook since it's a shorter book and holds a lot of appeal in it's other aspects.I hope to eventually get to the rest of the series!"}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah", "userReview": "I'd never been very attracted by Oke's books just because I wasn't drawn by the synopses.

Seriously? I am not joking? Because I know that that has happened to me. When Calls the Heart is my favorite book ever. That is why I reread this book to fulfill Reading Resolution #38 (Reread your favorite book). When by It Starts with a Book and I were creating this list, we both thought that rereading your favorite book would be a fun idea. At the beginning of the year, I wasn\u2019t sure what book I would use for this resolution. Then, after watching an episode from the Hallmark TV show, When Calls the Heart, I picked up this book and started reading it for the who-knows-what time.When I first read this book, I couldn\u2019t put it down. In less than a few days, I finished the entire When Calls the Heart Saga. I fell in love with Wynn and Elizabeth. Janette did an amazing job writing their story. I love, love, love (if you couldn\u2019t tell) the whole saga.Throughout the years, there have been many different covers of this book. So, I am rating just the cover above. That is the cover of the book that is on my bookshelf. I am giving this cover 4 stars. It may seem like an old-fashioned cover, but that is why I love it! If you get the whole saga in the old covers, you will see how the art keeps getting better and better, clearer and clearer.

Who wouldn't? It is wonderful. It was inspired (loosely) on the first book in the Canadian West series, When Calls the Heart. I have heard great things about Janette Oke, so I decided to give her Canadian West a try. Here are my thoughts:When Calls the Heart was intriguing and humorous. I started the book and really enjoyed the beginning, when Elizabeth first gets the invitation to head West, and her emotions and reactions and thoughts are normal and easily understood. Actually, her whole character and the way she acts throughout the entire book is so easily understood. The plot was simple and fun - it is a good, light summer read. It wasn't as much fun as the movie version (starring Stephen Amell as Wynn Delaney, and Maggie Grace as 'Aunt' Elizabeth Thatcher), but it was enjoyable. I related some of the things that both Wynn and Elizabeth did throughout the story to my older sister and we both ended up laughing. It was fun.The 'boxed lunch' scene in the school when the men are bidding for the boxed lunches made by the ladies was quite humorous. The game was that the ladies would make and bring a boxed lunch (enough to feed two people or more) and the men would bid on the lunch and whoever won got to eat the lunch with the lady who made it...Poor, poor Wynn...being snubbed by Elizabeth again and again and he has no idea why! :)The ending was very satisfactory. Honestly, Elizabeth's hasty decision to leave town was just that - hasty. Thank goodness Wynn caught up with her at the train station!Overall, a cute clean romance I would recommend to Janette Oke fans and historical fiction/romance readers."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1812322-sandy", "userReview": "I had to read this book for our week on Christian fiction for my grown-up books class. And the reason why I didn't like this book wasn't because it was Christian fiction, as I had expected. I actually thought that the spiritual/religious part was pretty tastefull and not overly preachy. Cheesy at parts, but tolerable. Not that I have a problem with religion or anything (I don't at all), but I just don't like being preached to and feeling like fictional characters are morally superior to me because they constantly talk about religion, which I think (admittedly, stereotypically) often happens in these kinds of books. But I could handle it here.The problem is that the writing is pretty terrible. It's an interesting enough premise and there are sections of the story that are nice. But it's just not pulled together very well. I had been hoping that the romantic tension - what the summary on the back builds up to be at the center of the story - would keep things interesting, but Elizabeth and Wynn's motives and their resulting actions just didn't add up in my mind, and I just have a hard time believing that it can all culminate in a \"I'm-going-back-East/Please-don't-leave-me\" scene like we got in the final chapters.

This is quality historical fiction, and it even surprised me how much I enjoyed the story. I'm in love with the basic plot, that Elizabeth (who comes from a fine, cultured family) is heading out West for adventure, to teach. She's feeling restless at home, and why not expand one's borders -- and help others at the same time? She has a good heart, that girl. And her heart may discover more than she expects it to on this journey... There are some touching scenes in the book -- and a few hilarious episodes too, like Elizabeth's encounter(s) with furry critters in her rustic home! I relished in every minute of the book -- even when I could see things coming (like Wynn), and Elizabeth never could. That's alright though; it made for some entertaining moments.Janette Oke's writing style is fantastic. It feel like it could have been published just last year, when in fact, this book originally came out in 1983?! This blows my mind.

(And yet did I binge-watch both seasons on Netflix? Yes, yes I did...) To my horror, I found the show to be significantly better than the book: *actual* character development, some semblance of frontier grittiness (but not much), and a romance that develops (instead of coming out of nowhere). This book reads more like a diary than a novel, which in and of itself isn't a problem--it's Oke's underdeveloped characterization, clunky writing, and poor plot development that kills it for me. Characterization- As a main character, Elizabeth is such a Mary Sue--almost too perfect. Elizabeth just frustrated me. She is adamant about not being married, yet wonders when she'll share her home with a husband. She is clearly from the upper class and grew up with servants, yet says that all women should be confident in their kitchen abilities. She doesn't understand that cats eat mice, yet after her struggles with both cats and mousetraps, she wonders if there's a move \"civilized way\" (122) to deal with the problem. - Oke doesn't bother to develop Wynn's character at all. We only find out on page 175 (of a 220-page book) that he's a Mountie, but we don't know anything about his job, his feelings (other than the usual \"If the RCMP wanted a Mountie to have a wife, they would have issued him one\" trope), or what even makes him attractive to Elizabeth. All we get is that Elizabeth seems to fall in love/lust with him at first sight, for reasons unspecified to the reader. (He's also a mansplainer (witness the scene about the fire and the dampers), which Elizabeth finds frustrating. A point in her favor!)- The supporting characters are bland and run together. What differentiates one child from another? What makes one townsperson any different from another? Most of them were just nondescript. Oke does a nice job at defining Jon's family, though. They were the only characters that felt real and not stock characters.Clunky writing- We get pages and pages about mice in the teacherage but precious little about the relationship between Elizabeth and Wynn. Why do they like each other? What is it about the other person that is so bewitching? We'll never know because Oke chose not to reveal their feelings. I know more about Elizabeth's feelings toward Napoleon the Mouse than of those toward Wynn, the man she \"wants to change his mind on marriage\" (176). - Oke sets this in a small town, yet Elizabeth has no idea that Wynn is single. Even in religious fiction, I assume that small-town gossip should be alive and well. How did Elizabeth have no interaction with other townspeople to not know? - Everything seems too sanitized: Elizabeth has no real problems in the town, she's easily able to get back to Calgary (to be fair, the show also does this, just worse: it would probably take days to get from the West back to Hamilton, but it only seems to take the characters a few hours), she's wanting for nothing, she has no crisis with any of the families, etc. It's just too clean to be accurate--there's nothing gritty about Oke's frontier. Even Laura Ingalls Wilder's frontier (as edited as it is) showed real hardship. Elizabeth could have been in a suburb of Toronto for all the setting played a part. Poor plot development- Besides reiterating that Oke gives us absolutely no clues as to why there is even a relationship between Elizabeth and Wynn, Elizabeth's career trajectory in the town and sudden desire to leave seems to come out of nowhere. The bear attack is the catalyst for her desire to leave?! (And I have to mention the ridiculous plot device of Wynn having to kiss Elizabeth so that she doesn't faint. What is this?!) In the rest of the diary-like book, we were given no indications that she was feeling such strong second feelings. - Oke detailed Elizabeth's interactions with her family in Toronto and Calgary quite well, but the rest of the story felt rushed and underdeveloped. (Except for the mouse parts. She definitely developed the mouse parts.) We don't really see anything about Elizabeth's life in the town or if/how she's changed from being a Toronto city teacher to a rural frontier one. Overall, I was shocked at how much better the show was than the book (words I don't often say...but the bar was set quite low)--and just how lacking this book is in every way from the classic \"young teacher heads to remote area, adventures and romance ensue\" novel, Christy. Everything Oke did in this book, Catherine Marshall did better. Life struggles, fish-out-of-water sensations, growing up, crises of faith, and relationships: Christy much better described the real challenges of being a 19-year-old teacher in the early part of the twentieth century."}, {"userName": "Kaye", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/885151-kaye", "userReview": "1983 Rating: 4.5 stars2014 Rating: 3 starsThis is the first time I've re-read this book since it came out thirty years ago. As a YA reader, I absolutely adored it and the first two or three sequels (I think I read four books in this series as they came out); it went quite well with the Sunfire romances from Scholastic that I was reading at the time. I do remember that I enjoyed them much more than the Love Comes Softly series that I was reading around the same time. (I went to a very small, very conservative Christian school for junior high, and Oke's books were available in the school library and so were acceptable to carry around and read on breaks; most of the rest of what I read at home wasn't.)I've been . . . well, \"enjoying\" is a bit strong of a term . . . entertained recently by the Hallmark series inspired by When Calls the Heart, so I thought now would be as good a time as any to re-read it. I'm going to count this as my Inspy Historical Romance in my 2014 Genre Reading Challenge, though there are a few things about this book that, even by my definition, disqualify it from that genre.First, it's written in first-person. I'm not a big fan of first-person historicals and I have a hard time counting anything but those in the Gothic subgenre as \"romance\" novels---because for me, romance novels need to include the hero's POV as well as the heroine's.Second, though she gets a glimpse of the hero about 1/3 of the way into the book, she doesn't actually meet him and have a conversation with him until 50% of the way in. There's \"insta-love\" (because, let's recall, this is an Inspy romance, so it's definitely not insta-lust) on her part. His? We don't know---because, again, we don't get his POV.Third, there's very little relationship development between the two of them in the last 50% of the book because they're so rarely together. A picnic here, a family dinner there. All the while, he's maintaining his attitude that Mounties shouldn't marry because it's selfish---unfair to the woman, who won't be able to handle the kind of rough living that a Mountie in the outback of Canada (can I call it that?) would have to deal with.Other than those things, it's pretty standard Prairie Romance fare: City Girl goes West to teach in Country Town and has to learn how to rough-it while falling in love with Local Law Man. It even includes the Big Misunderstanding trope: she believes he's married and the father of one of the boys in her school. This Big Misunderstanding carries through most of the last half of the book because, let's face it, there is almost no relationship development, so there's no conversation in which the truth can be revealed. And Wynn never uses the terms \"my sister-in-law\" or \"my nephew,\" which might clue her in. If he's as interested in Elizabeth as he's supposed to be, you'd think that, after continually getting the cold shoulder from her, he might take the opportunity to drop a few terms like that into a conversation to see if that makes a difference.This book is basically Christy-lite: first person, wide-eyed, naive heroine; country school house; learning the quirks of a small town, etc. The good thing here, though, is that there's no love triangle forced upon the heroine. (Oh, and as far as that goes, in Christy, I'm Team-David all the way!)Revisiting this book, I was really surprised by how little a presence the Mounties have, and what little attention is paid to the fact that Wynn is a Mountie. I guess because I have the memory of the story as it continues after they're married in the sequels, and because that's a huge draw of the TV show (ahhhhh, Mountie Jack!), I expected it to be more of a...thing in the book. The red serge coat, the boots, the hat, etc. But it's really downplayed in the book.Another thing that surprised me going back to this one was how light it is on the Inspy part. It's clean, she goes to church, she prays, she's shown reading her Bible. There was one long \"internal sermon\" section that I skipped over (when she's having a long internal monologue over what she's just read in her quiet time), but other than that, there isn't any Bible thumping, verse quoting, witnessing/evangelizing, or sermonizing in this book (unlike in Love Comes Softly, where there's a full presentation of the gospel so Marty can get saved to be worthy of Clark's love). All said, this was a quick, light read, and, while at twelve years old, I couldn't wait for the next book in the series, I do believe that a revisit to the first volume is quite enough for me now."}, {"userName": "Elinor", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11258836-elinor", "userReview": "Since my own novel Wildwood relates to pioneer history in Alberta, I wanted to check out another historical novel by this extremely popular author who has written 75 books, sold 23 million copies, and has seen a TV series based on her books! Janette Oke is considered a Christian author but references to God were infrequent in this novel, about a young woman from Toronto who takes up a teaching position in a rural Alberta school. Many of her experiences were amusing (huddled inside her cabin, fearing that pack of coyotes outside would tear her to pieces), while others were heartwarming (when her little community raises money to send a handicapped child to Calgary for treatment). There is a romance element as she finds herself attracted to the handsome Mountie, and I'm sure the relationship progresses in subsequent books in the series. This was altogether a very pleasant read and I can understand why Janette Oke has so many fans worldwide."}, {"userName": "TJ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2346207-tj", "userReview": "Average, just average.

I LOVED that Elizabeth was level headed and reasonable. I loved the way faith and God were woven into the book.I also maybe made fun of how, much like the Call the Midwife show and the NHS, this book (and presumably series) sometimes seemed to be one big ad for Canadian Mounties."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10069096-elizabeth", "userReview": "Ok so let me explain myself first. I first heard about this book from the tv show that my mother dragged me into watching. I had been putting it off and so we would watch something else because I'm not a huge fan of Hallmark shows/movies because I find them to be too corny/cliche for me. Well I finally gave in and still thought it was cheesy/corny/cliche/eye rolling but I found myself wanting to watch more and more of the tv show which then made me curious about the book series. To my surprise the book series and tv show are drastically different from each other but I still enjoyed reading this book. This book could easily be a stand alone book. Overall 4 star rating."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4877728-melissa", "userReview": "This was a wonderful little book. I have read some of Janette Oke's books before and enjoyed them, so when I spotted this series I was excited to start reading it.When Calls the Heart is the first book in Oke's Canadian West Series. It follows a main character of Elizabeth and is written in the first person from her perspective.A school teacher back East, she travels to the West to begin a new school teaching job at the advice of her brother Jon. Before she learns of her assignment, the superintendent tries to woo her, and in failing to do so seemingly banishes her 150 miles North to the town of Pine Springs.Determined to make the best of it, Elizabeth travels there and sets up her school. She is delighted to find that she has her own little home by the schoolhouse instead of boarding and also that her brother's handsome friend Wynn Delaney is also in residence at Pine Springs as well.The children she teaches are mostly charming and her heart goes out to all of them in unique ways. She makes close friends with a family of immigrants nearby and these children frequently appear in the novel to help her out and spend time with her so she doesn't become too lonely on her own.Another student in particular, a boy named Andy, is frequently sick but a favorite of hers and all the other children. Having been in an accident when he was quite young, he has trouble learning but is always positive and supportive of everyone else. When his sickness gets worse they raise money to send him to a doctor. This involves a fundraiser put on by Elizabeth and the schoolchildren.During this fundraiser, Wynn, whom she now believes to be married, wins an auction for a lunch with her and she is so thoroughly embarrassed to be pursued by a \"married\" man that she sets forth a sequence of events to turn him down at every opportunity, despite secretly admiring him.It is only when she discovers her mistake that she realizes her deep feelings for him and can only be saddened as he appears to love his job more than her. He is very particular to his job and does not feel that being the wife of a Mountie is anything he would do to someone he loves.Oke, while being a Christian writer, does not get overly hard handed or preachy with her writing. While some references and scriptures may be written in, she prefers to lead by example; having her characters do acts of good rather than preach about them. This makes it easy for even those who are not very religious to read her books. Her writing, while not overly complex suits the romance genre just fine and you can connect to her characters as they seem like real people. They aren't just perfect characters that do whatever is right and good, they have flaws just like everyone else.Oke also took the time to include a bit of history in this story which helps the reader to understand the background and setting of the novel. She elaborates on the town of Calgary and also of the Mounties as one of the main characters, Wynn Delaney, is a Mountie himself.I really enjoyed the premise of this novel. Most often writers have the heroine just falling into the arms of their chosen man. Elizabeth is not like that. She is strong enough on her own and doesn't need a man, she only consents because she is truly in love, not dependent upon him. I feel that this shapes her character a lot better than if she had just stuck to regular romance and had Elizabeth completely infatuated with the man. It made the story more believable.The only fault I would find with the novel is Wynn's quick change of heart at the end. While it was written to seem that he couldn't stomach the thought of being without her, due to his earlier convictions that were so strong, it just seems unlikely that he would change his mind so easily.Janette Oke is a fantastic story teller and her novels reflect life on the early plains of Canada. They are a pleasure to read and are perfect for a lazy Sunday or rainy afternoon.When Calls the HeartCopyright 1983220 pages"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7545257-jessica", "userReview": "This was probably one of the best Christian Fiction books I've ever read. The story was so wonderful. I loved how realistic everything was. The plotline flowed naturally as did the romance. It wasn't forced. It wasn't clich\u00e9 or cheesy. It was just right.Elizabeth's story was great. I loved how her teaching so far from home came about. Having seen the series on Hallmark first, I decided to read the books after my mom said they were better. She was right, they are better. For starters, you learn a lot about Elizabeth (Not the one from the tv series but an older relation who came before her who is mentioned in the pilot episode.) I liked seeing her rich and lavish lifestyle in contrast to what she came to live in her new, more rustic home as a country teacher. Her stories about her ordeals of the first few days - dealing with mice, new students, and a much simpler, more rugged lifestyle \u2013 were captivating. I found myself swept up in the story despite my original qualms about the story set up and point of view.Wynn was just plain awesome. Loved his character. It was so much better reading his and Elizabeth's love story unfold rather than watching that pilot episode on Hallmark. There was so much more detail and explanation behind Wynn's actions. I loved that their romance unfolded naturally. It felt more realistic and lifelike compared to many of the Christian romantic/historical fictions published these days. Also, that ending... Oh my, it was perfect! That's all I'm going to say on the subject.I somewhat liked the hallmark tv series, but I LOVED the books. I already started reading the sequel!"}, {"userName": "Sarah Beth", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth", "userReview": "Janette Oke and I go way back. In the waning days of my total obsession with Oregon Trail books as a child, I came across her books in middle school and became obsessed with them for their innocent love stories (my mother was thankful for this too) and their historical fiction settings. I'm a pretty voracious reader, but Janette Oke is a very prolific writer, so I think her Canadian West series are the only ones I never read. (And this is terrible, but the copies my library had had hideous ugly, plastic peeling covers and brown/tan cover pictures - total violation of the don't judge a book by it's cover!!). When I saw this book as a free kindle ebook, I was instantly nostalgic for my pre-teen Janette Oke days and started reading it. As far as Christian fiction goes, Oke is among the least pushy and preachy of the bunch. Her interweaving of faith in her characters is very tastefully done and I never feel like I'm reading a religious book, but just a novel about people who happen to hold their faith as important. I really loved Elizabeth and her story as a one-room schoolteacher on the Canadian frontier. Her struggles living on her own and coping with mice and making do reminded me a lot of Little House on the Prairie. Wynn is obviously Elizabeth's crush from the beginning and I admired his character and his dedication to his profession. My only complaint with this book is it was too short! I didn't feel like it gave enough time to fully develop the characters or the love story. Otherwise a very sweet, simple read. 3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5862081-jessica", "userReview": "The first 3/4th's of the book were the funniest, most realistic fiction I may have read before. The troubles that Elizabeth faces are small everyday issues about learning new customs, how to live on your own for the first time, and dealing with animal pests. It might sound very boring, but Elizabeth's thoughts are so well-written I felt like I really was reading a real person's diary from the time. I could relate to many of her troubles from when I first moved out on my own.If that had been all the story was, I would have given it four stars. But thrown in at the very end was a love story that ruined the intense realism of the first sections. Elizabeth and the \"love of her life\" interact very rarely and suddenly every unlikely stereotypical romance trope is thrown out, including Elizabeth falling, fainting, and being rescued from life-threatening danger. The love between the two just doesn't seem real, despite Elizabeth's repeated assertions she's fallen in love with some guy she's met like three times and talked to (for a few sentences) twice.My final comment is on the Christian content of the book. It was refreshing to read a historical fiction of this genre that didn't preach or contain some convoluted message about redemption and forgiveness and how life is incomplete without God (hint hint for the reader). Instead it merely portrayed a very religious woman living in a time period when religion was very important to most people."}], "description": "Nothing in her cultured East Coast upbringing prepared Elizabeth for a teaching position on the Canadian frontier.
