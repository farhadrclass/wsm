Sort of a historical Gothic suspense novel with a little bit of romance and a Caribbean twist. Oh yeah, and a little Chinese subplot on the side. It's a tad dated, but still enjoyable.

I think the book blurb is sufficient to whet the appetite of potential readers, and I'm too lazy to try to recap what doesn't need fixing.Thoughts? Very enjoyable romantic suspense in a believable historical setting. Lots of surprise twists and turns and people who turn out to be not exactly who they're supposed to be. A spectacular death (oooh, the spear, the lightning bolt!), an adventure at sea on the lam from the law, a wild ride in a hurricane and a hunt for long-lost Spanish gold. What more can a reader want? My only quibbles was the foreshadowing was a bit heavy handed, plus some slow spots here and there. Oh, and don't let that racy cover fool you. While there is a romantic element, you're not going to get in-your-face sex at all."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3919132-linda", "userReview": "In 1897, Miss Emma Delaney\u2019s uncle betrothed her to Mr. Oliver Foy. She had just turned eighteen years of age. He was 36 and was one of the island of Jamaica\u2019s prime bachelors. He was a gentleman during their brief engagement. But soon after the wedding ceremony, Emma discovered their holy wedlock dissolved into a marriage from hell. On a stormy night and with the assistance of a dear friend, the young woman escaped on a small ship that Daniel Choong had built. Originally her servant, Daniel became her companion, teacher and guardian. With his guidance, Emma survived. \u2019I found that the secret of true contentment in the life we lived was never to think more than a day into the future and never to think of the past at all. We had only three concerns; the weather, the boat and our provisions.\u2019Three years passed in a short period of time. Then fate takes a hand. The Long Masquerade referred to Emma disguised as \u2018Casey\u2019. It was a combination of historical fiction, light adventure and mild suspense with a setting in the West Indies and England. I was surprised at the original publication year: 1981. Because of some innuendoes, I expected an earlier declaration by at least two decades. Still, if you are a fan of Ms. Brent, it is a must-read. For those of you looking for romance, Emma/Casey finally earns a well-deserved HEA. *Free on openlibrary.org*"}, {"userName": "Tweety", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21428432-tweety", "userReview": "That was the most breath taking ending I have ever read. I can't believe it's all over\u2026\nAlong the coast of Jamaica Emma lives with her Aunt, Uncle and Daniel. She has been an orphan since she was too little to remember. Though her family cares for her, there isn't much love lost between them. So when they tell her what they have decided Emma is surprised to say the least that her Aunt and Uncle have excepted a proposal of marriage for her. She's only met her intended a few times, but she knows he's handsome, likable and rich. So, feeling there is nothing else to do she marries him as if in a dream, only to wake up in a nightmare. She has married the Devil himself in Oliver Foy.Sometimes he fools her, and she almost believes that he wants to change. Then he breaks out into a worse monster than before. Daniel warns her, that the night of the great tropical storm she must watch for her life.That's when everything changes, and the Adventure begins. That night Emma runs away with Daniel, her father figure on his beautiful sail/steam boat where they go diving for numerous things. They become fugitives, hunted and searched for. When things cool down and Emma plays the part of a Coolie woman, talking pigeon English when she must speak. (Emma is Sooo funny!) But this sweet dream, that Emma wishes could last forever, ends suddenly in a horrific storm and Daniel proves to be true friend to the end.  Now Emma is in far greater danger of living a masquerade that she can not hide long. Unless she can end it all, she will be uncovered and never find happiness again. Love, Love Loved this book! \nWhat\n could be better than Murder, Treasure, Hidden Identities, Masked Feelings all set along the shimmering Jamaican coast and England? And Emma, she was Perfect! No, not the goodies-two-shoes type perfect but the Human Perfect. She had moments of panic, fear, and joy. I couldn't help but love her! There are a few swears and minimal violence seen by reader. But marital rape Is obviously in it as well as wife beating. Thankfully, Oliver Foy is only in the first third so after that the ominous cloud created by his presence is lifted. All though it has all these elements, none of it is glorified or described in detail, it just goes black. PG-13 Some other books that I feel are just as good, Golden Urchin, ( which Was better believe it or not), Trade Wind and Lord of the Far Island. All of these belong on my Grab-During-Fire shelf."}, {"userName": "Dorcas", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21426381-dorcas", "userReview": "4 StarsFirst off, ignore the cover. This can hardly be called a romance, let alone a bodice ripper. I think there are two chaste kisses in the whole book. Yes, TWO!. No, three but we don't count her nasty husband's kiss. OK! Now that we've got that out of the way, lets talk about the book itself... I love Madeleine Brent! She (who was actually a he) puts the reader right there in the story and from page one you feel invested in the characters. And then the adventure and locations, you never 'stay put' in a M.B. book, youre always seeing new places and cultures. (If you like Anne Maybury, MMKaye, Victoria Holt etc you will love Madeleine Brent). In this case, the story starts off in Jamaica... The beginning is a bit sordid, in that Emma marries a man who is a horrid beast who abuses her. When the abuse culminates during a hurricane and her actual life is in danger she manages to run away with a half chinese man (former servant, like a father to her) on his sail/steam boat. They make it look as though they die in the storm and then basically change their identities and wander the islands for three years. Emma is incognito as 'the coolie's woman', speaking creole pidgen and diving for lobsters etc. Love her pidgen!!Without giving the plot away, she ends up in England and finally in Jamaica again. There is danger at home, danger at sea, and finally danger under the sea....Why 4 stars?I thought the middle of the story dragged a bit. The author allows us to see the peacefulness her life became at that juncture but I found it a bit dull. Also, her husband at the beginning was such a jerk (think Dragonwyck but without the charm) that it was hard to enjoy the few chapters where she is married to him, and yet it was needed to lay the 'terror foundation'..Once she is on the boat with Daniel (the chinese 'father') the excitement really kicks up and later when she comes back to Jamaica, very satisfying exciting ending! M.B. really delivers on her culminating suspense!! I can't tell you, you have to read it!CONTENT:SEX: None shown to reader but marital rape/abuse was obviously an issue at the beginning.VIOLENCE: Action violence. Some people get killed.PROFANITY: a few very mild cussesMY RATING: PG-13 (because of the marital abuse~ FYI the abuse is behind closed doors but its still creepy cos you know what happens)"}, {"userName": "Bree (AnotherLookBook)", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2778736-bree-anotherlookbook", "userReview": "A historical novel about a woman who escapes a dangerous marriage to a wealthy Jamaican, trading material comfort for a life of disguise and hardship on the seas. 1981.Full review (and other awesome recommendations) at Another look bookI have 5% battery life left on my laptop...let's dim the screen and get typing! Haha.I read this book back during the summer, but ever since then it's been on my \"must review\" list. I do so love Madeleine Brent, and am equally delighted and terrified at the prospect of making it through all of his historical fiction novels. I usually try to \"hoard\" my favorite authors' books, but with Brent's works it's simply not possible.I loved the gothic element of The Long Masquerade. I loved, once again, the demonstration of practical skills by the novel's heroine. The relationships were unconventional, unexpected, and usually delightful. The only relationship that was *definitely* not delightful was the heroine's marriage early on in the novel. This section only covered about 30 pages (so like 1/10 of the book), but it was the plot element that colored the whole book and had longstanding plot repercussions. If you can make it through this fairly distressing 1/10 of the book, you'll simply adore the rest of it. (Especially in comparison to that 1/10!)Overall, a great read that I'd definitely recommend to fans of historical fiction, strong-minded, useful heroines, and a healthy dash of the gothic.6% battery life left now!

The Jamaican location and descriptions of both water and high location coffee planting estate during the late Victorian period era held a spell indeed. People mixed of classes and origins, and the orphan Emma promised off in marriage by her uncle to Oliver Fry, owner of the larger estate just next door.And the tale gets increasingly tempestuous as the marriage turns into one of violent abuse. Only accomplished in secret. This is not a romance as the cover seems to depict. Not at all. It's an adventure story, much as in the spirit of those old film roll fills called \"The Perils of Pauline\".Because Emma, turned Casey is high seas hand and disguised for 3 years after her escape. And then the adventures become so tumultuous that all belief became, for me, too serial calamitous to be cohesive.Eventually she saves a life and travels to England using another life's \"name\"- new identity. Marries there too and then it all goes wrong. Again. But this time in circumstance and law; Chad, her husband is more than decent. It's not of a current writing style or sensibility (post 2000). Regardless of the excellent word craft and conversational \"disguising\" that's evident throughout- the nature of the reoccurring coincidences became cartoon like. Super hero slant cartoon like, at that.The first half was a 4. But by the end of this tale- that outlandish circumstance quotient is exactly what reduced it an entire star. The fact that as much as she was an independent thinker and a tremendously strong in the physical woman, the men end up determining more than she did for her own end effect. This is fiction in a sense of larger than life characters and is neither historical fiction or romance in the sense of how they are written currently.

The other cover is pretty much like a Harlequin romance, which is far from it. What I like about this Gothic books (written by MB, VH..) is that the plot takes place in exotic places. Here is in the Caribbean, besides England.I was not prepared for the abuse though. It is a PG rated book, so there is nothing described, but that does not make what Emma goes thru less horrible. She marries a beast who abuses her physical, sexual and mentally. She manages to escape after thinking her husband died, along with a man she loves as a father. I enjoyed her adventures as a coolie sailor girl. Once she is back to England things slowed down a bit. Maybe it was because I did not like Sam, the man who rescues her.This may be the first time the physical aspect of the book may influence my like/dislike of the story:If you want to buy this book, please avoid the Souvenir Press Edition! This is the ugliest book I have in my personal library. Or that I ever had in my hands. The material is cheap, looks like a school textbook. The paper is the kind it is used in offices, the ink shines under the light, the margin may be 3cm top (1.18 inches?) and 3cm bottom and the text itself is tiny and squeezed together. On the top of that, there are a lot of stains and some orthographic mistakes. When I was immersed in the book it was almost fine, but every time I had to restart I had the temptation to burn it. It is the cheapest looking book, although the price is not cheap.DON'T BUY THIS EDITION!

The other two I've read are Moonraker's Bride and Golden Urchin. All three contain these common themes: 1) Heroine grows up in difficult circumstances in a different country outside of England, 2) She learns skills she doesn't think are that important but ends up saving everyone using those exact skills she learned growing up, 3) She eventually ends up coming to England and has to learn how to become a true lady and act appropriately in society, 4) The love interest doesn't feel like he can express his love until the end of the book when they think they're all going to die, 5) They all end up financially set for life due to some hidden treasure or inheritance. I've really enjoyed Brent's writing and even though each book is similar I've enjoyed them all. However, after three books so similar in plot, I think I need a little variation.As for The Long Masquerade, I almost stopped reading when it got to the part with the abusive husband. It made me sick to think about. Fortunately, it wasn't ever detailed or graphic and it didn't last too long.

I really am sorry that he (yes, his real name was Peter O'Donnell) has passed away and we will no longer be able to read his wonderful stories.
