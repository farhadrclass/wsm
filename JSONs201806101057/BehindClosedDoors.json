The characters are underdeveloped and I feel no connection to them whatsoever. Valerie is unbelievably, annoyingly naive. She's had 7 pregnancies in 6 years (resulting in 5 children and 2 miscarriages), despite the fact that her husband uses condoms b/c he doesn't want to have children. Lol. The storyline just feels very one-dimensional with no depth of emotion to speak of. It's all just words on a page to me about a woman I would like to strangle myself, if her husband weren't already doing so. The best comparison I can make of this author is to Danielle Steele (who I've also tried and failed to like). I normally dislike starting books without finishing them, but I think I might move on to something else. Maybe I'll just flip through the rest of the book to see if anything interesting happens."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6519998-lisa", "userReview": "It took a while to get into this book, but I'm glad I stuck with it.While others have complained about character development, I think it was written this way to show the abuse and how it can can shape and form the lives of the whole family. The choices and the paths each of the kids took and how their lives ended up. It wasn't a chick lit fluffy story that gets all wrapped up in a bow. Nor was it an emotional journey detailing and resolving every little thing that happened in Valarie's life.I don't think this book is for everyone, but I enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3294105-cynthia", "userReview": "A really good read about a women, abuse, and her family over three generations."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3663222-emma", "userReview": "I wasn't so sure about reading this book but it turned out really well.

I found myself thinking about the characters all through the day and could not wait to revisit them. I felt so bad for Valerie and all that she had been through. At times there was some fluff which is what kept it from meeting my 5 star scale . I would definitely recommend this book . Purchase your copy so you can put it on your shelf and go back to it again. I know I am."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4427991-mary", "userReview": "Raised in a large, loving, closely-knit Irish Catholic family living in Vermont, Valerie O'Connor is a sheltered and innocent young woman who comes of age during the 1950s. At the age of eighteen, Valerie meets and falls desperately in love with twenty-five-year-old Jack Marsh - a handsome, dashing Korean War veteran and a member of the Air Force. Valerie has been raised with the belief that a wife is subservient to her husband and a mother must keep her family together no matter what. However, little does she know that she is about to begin a relationship that is doomed from the start.Jack Marsh is a damaged man; a man whose inner demons cause him to take his fears and insecurities out on his wife and five children. During their many years of marriage, Valerie has learned to say nothing when Jack, now an airline mechanic, arrives home after midnight, silent and emotionally distant. She ignores the shirts that smell of strange perfume and the handkerchiefs smeared with suspicious lipstick stains. She endures without complaint the bouts of drunken rage, the sudden bursts of violence, the morning after scenes of devastatingly sincere, choking remorse. And, whatever the consequences, Valerie will never discuss such private issues with her children; who are themselves too terrified to speak lest they become their father's next victims. To make matters worse, Jack moves Valerie and their children all the way across the country, taking Valerie away from her family, isolating her from the very people who know her and care for her the most. Too proud to ask for help or to admit her failure as a wife and a mother, Valerie is unable to protect either herself or her children from Jack's increasingly visible and physically violent rages.As they grow up, the five Marsh children will carve out their own very different futures. One by one, pushed to the extreme, the children will manage to escape their fractured home. In one fashion or another, each child will ultimately leave, until they are all gone - even Ricky, the youngest son and the one who is perhaps the most troubled. The only one left is Jack, and Valerie finally must face the reality of her marriage and her life.And then, as if out of the ashes, another generation begins. Will history repeat itself? Valerie's children worry, and even though they have successfully escaped their dysfunctional family, they will never escape the devastating effects it has had on each of their lives. This is a powerful story of a marriage begun with the best of intentions, but cursed by a legacy of violence that will have shocking consequences - a story that resonates with us all.I absolutely loved this book; couldn't put it down. In my opinion, Susan R. Sloan is an excellent writer. This is only the third book by Ms. Sloan that I've read, but it most certainly will not be the last one that I read. I give this book an A+! - if I could give it an A+++!, I most certainly would! :)"}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2679733-michelle", "userReview": "This was my first time reading a book by Susan R. Sloan, and will probably be my last.My favorite part of reading is the character development, where the character becomes someone you care about so you feel drawn back to the book to see whats going to happen, but 'Behind Closed Doors' didn't do that for me. Yes, I was interested in seeing where everyone's lives went but I could have easily just put the book down, and not have returned. In their 60+ years of marriage Valerie and Jack had five children and three out of the five left the Marsh home to escape their abusive father. However, once they left the house you didn't read about them again, until almost the last pages of the book. Sloan did however develop the character of Ricky--the youngest son of Valerie and Jack. But I guess the question is why just him? Yes, he had a difficult childhood, which lead him to be rebellious in his adolescence, but for me I would have liked to have seen that much effort put into the other children as well. Instead Sloan ties their story lines off in a few short sentences closer to end of the novel, which was disappointing.So what did I enjoy about 'Behind Closed Doors?' Not much I guess, I did enjoy how Sloan started the book out at present day, and then went back to the Fifties when Jack and Valerie meet and followed them from there. But other than that this book left more to be desired."}, {"userName": "Bev Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5162540-bev-taylor", "userReview": "where secrets are too terrible to reveal valerie has led a sheltered life but then meets someone who she thinks is the man of her dreams h/e she soon finds out that all is not perfect - not to mention the sex! h/e she puts up with this for the sake of getting pregnant after 5 children she loses her uterus so that is it. she throws herself into motherhood but her husband has a fear of her leaving her. this because his mother died while giving birth to him her children go their separate ways - some good, some bad and then it is just her and her husband. now both in their sixties. how will it end? bev"}, {"userName": "Didichan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7082498-didichan", "userReview": "Raine could you be any more cheap... i am starting to understand what TSTL heroine is... goodness i hate girls that are just to easy ... this the reason i hate romantic suspense .... the girls have no self respect.... the man called her a slut or was it whore ... this story is was than a cheap xrated video ... what a disgusting book .. i would never read any think by this woman again with her disrespect for me and her female lead that lack any sense of dignity ... sicking"}, {"userName": "Paula", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4063711-paula", "userReview": "While I enjoyed reading this book, I thought it was just ok with a lot of unfinished threads, ie, if a woman who wanted 10 kids (whose husband wanted none?!) how come we never read another word about her hysterectomy?

Several sudden and mysterious transformations that were inadequately explained made the story loose it's appeal. I think it tried to tell too much over too much time.
