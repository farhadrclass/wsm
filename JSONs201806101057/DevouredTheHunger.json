When he awakes in the hospital, he is shocked to find a plague has struck Pittsburgh, a plague that mutates its victims and turns them into eyeless, savage, flesh-eating horrors! Even with help from some new friends, can Lance escape the abattoir Pittsburgh has become?After reading his West of Hell trilogy, Jason Brant invited me to give his Hunger series a shot. It took me a while to take the bait but Brant soon had me hooked once again.Before even opening the book, or whatever the equivalent of opening an e-book is, I kept thinking \"Zombies? Aren't we all getting tired of that shit?\" Brant puts his spin on the survival horror tale and I Devoured it in two sittings. Besides, his plague victims aren't zombies. They have some virus that makes their eyes fall out and their brain functions go haywire, mutating them into cannibal feral things with fangs and caveman brows.The protagonist of the tale, Lance York, was a guy I could really get behind. He wasn't a hyper-prepared militant or a survivalist super hero. He's kind of a screw up, he's going through a divorce, and is unemployed. Oh, and he's also infertile. Lance spends the first part of the book escaping the hospital and dealing with his soon to be ex-wife and her boyfriend. The book kicks into high gear once Lance finally escapes the hospital, deals with militants, and hooks up with Cassandra, an ax-wielding failed artist. The scope ratchets up with every revelation. By the time Lance gets his legs under him, it's pretty apparent that civilization is going down the toilet pretty quickly. The gore and carnage are the stars of the show here and they spend a lot of time on stage. The Vladdies, as Cassandra calls them, are pretty terrifying. However, the militia assholes were much bigger villains considering they're human and the Vladdies are practically forces of nature.While this is the first book in a trilogy, it's pretty satisfying on its own with no cliffhanger ending or anything else that might leave a reader feeling cheated.I can't find anything bad to say about this book. Like Edward Lorn, Jason Brant is self-publishing done right. Four out of five stars."}, {"userName": "Mr. Matt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15984059-mr-matt", "userReview": "Lance is having what can only be considered a monumentally bad day. He's unemployed. He bombed his job interview. His wife is leaving him and he's pretty sure she's also sleeping with an obnoxiously successful former co-worker. And he bumps into one of the infected. Oh, and he gets hit by a car. Lance wakes up in the hospital and all hell begins breaking loose. The Xavier virus is on the loose and the infection is spreading alarmingly. Attempts at quarantine fail and in a matter of days the city of Pittsburgh is burning.This book was not great fiction, it was awesome fiction. I loved every page of it - from Lance's escape form the hospital, to his holing up in his apartment, to the flight to Heinz field and the ultimate cataclysmic collapse. I identified with Lance. As he struggled to survive I found myself thinking, yeah, that's what I would do. He felt real. He worried about other people. He tried to stay out of trouble. He tried to do the right thing. And Cass, wow, she is a little bit of a caricature, but how can you not like a battle-axe wielding blonde built like an Amazon? And she's got a mouth like a sailor. Bonus!Very impressed with this book (and the author). I thought I was picking up another zombie apocalypse (yawn) and discovered a diamond in the rough. Brant has a knack for building characters, driving an action packed story and making me give a damn. I ripped through this book in pretty much two major binge reading sessions. So much fun.My only knock against the book is the presence of the crazy \"minute men\" militia. They are almost a requirement in apocalypse literature. The infected are like the weather - a menace and problem that must be dealt with - but the real foe are other people. I wish that the author had found a differnet twist to drive the story, but it's fine. The book was just fun.Five gory, blood-stained stars out of five. I'm pretty sure that my mom would not appreciate it, but it was a complete and total blast to read.Down graded to four stars on further reflection. I liked the book but is it really five stars.

I love the way by which Brant has created a unique plague-based transformation that begins to appear to turn humans into zombies, which is merely the first phase in a more vampire-esque ultimate transformation.The ending of what appears to be book 1 in an ongoing series left me satisfied, yet eager for Brant's return to this world so I can see what happens next.A great writer, an intriguing story and a fun dynamic between the main characters - what more could a reader want?"}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15307591-jamie", "userReview": "This was my second Jason Brant novel. I had previously read Gehanna - his West of Hell series book 1 and really enjoyed it. In fact I bought the West of Hell Omnibus edition and fully intended to read it but then I got to looking at the cover of this book: Devoured (The Hunger Volume 1) and it just drew me to it so I thought I'd read the sample to see what it was like and I was immediately sucked into a swirling vortex of pure awesomeness and was unable to put the book down so I ended up buying it and those two seconds waiting for it to fully load on my kindle were pure torture.Jason Brant doesn't mess around. One of the things I loved about this book is that the action starts up right out of the gate and doesn't let up until the very last harrowing page. Everything you could want from a good post-apocalyptic zombie invasion was here. A mutant zombie horde - check! Lots and lots of action - check! Just enough gore to satisfy you but not enough to make you hurl while eating your lunch - check! The one thing I generally don't like about some action heavy oriented novels is that the characters usually suffer from it but have no fear, Mr Brant has seemingly mastered the fine art of balancing action and character depth. The characters in Devoured are ones that you can not only relate to but also root for and for that this book gets a huge nod from me.Lance is the main hero of the tale. I love the fact that he's just an ordinary guy. In fact life has been very unkind to Lance York. In the real world he hasn't been able to hold down a job in years, his wife can't stand the sight of him and his marriage is crumbling faster than a zombie can eat your brains. Lance has pretty much lost what self esteem and self respect he once had and as the world begins to go to the zombies he finally starts to come into his own. He's a good guy, the kind of person you'd want on your side if you all of the sudden found yourself at the bottom of the food chain while zombies and crazy militants ran around killing everyone.Lance survives the initial destruction of mankind by hiding out in a restaurant for a while and when things quickly turn for the worse and it looks like his brains are going to be eaten after all he is saved by one of the most unlikeliest heroines to ever grace the pages of zombie fiction. Enter Cassie or Cass as she demands to be called She carries a big axe, is full of attitude, (and I mean that in the most awesome way possible) and has a whacked out sense of fashion, and ho she's the true bada** (self censored) of the tale. Her interactions with Lance are priceless and I love how his self confidence goes way up after meeting her. I also love the fact that the woman is the true action hero of the tale. She's athletic, strong and quick on her feet as well as her mind. Lance on the other hand is a bit out of shape not that he let's that stop him but Cass, well she's something else. I had such an amazingly fun time reading this book. It's not your average run-of-the-mill zombie book and these are in no way your average zombies and trust me, this makes all the difference in the world. If you are looking for an action-packed read with witty dialogue, colorful characters and a unique take on a genre that already has so many books to choose from then you can hardly do better than Devoured. I've already bought and started reading the second book: Consumed and I happily give this one a very enthusiastic 5 Stars. Heck, I wish I could give this an extra star just for Cass alone. She's freaking awesome! Great read and I highly recommend it!!!http://jamiesbookblog.com/devoured-ja..."}, {"userName": "Terri Baldwin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12420797-terri-baldwin", "userReview": "Lance, by his own admission, was a loser. Stuck in a failed marriage and unable to keep a job, he had succumbed to depression and had pretty much given up. While walking down the street talking to an old coworker that he hadn\u2019t seen in years, he noticed an incoherent woman stumbling toward an intersection and certain death. He was struck by a car when he pushed the woman to safety, but the insanity was just beginning. While in the hospital, he learned that the woman was infected with a virus that had turned her into a cannibalistic monster. She wasn\u2019t the only infected; it seemed the entire city of Pittsburgh was under attack, and the military closed in to quarantine the hospital. With the help of a doctor and a staff sergeant with a conscious, Lance was able to get his soon-to-be ex wife and her boyfriend (his old coworker), to safety and to escape the hospital. His journey to safety, however, was far from over!Jason Brant has made me afraid of the dark once again! His rendering of these \u201cVladdies\u201d was horrifying. They\u2019re a terrifying cross between demons, zombies and vampires, and the true stuff of nightmares! Lance and his travelling companion Cass were quite a pair. The banter made me smile even while my heart was pounding and I was struggling to remind myself that it was okay to exhale! These two \u201cfailures\u201d came into their own and proved their own opinions of themselves wrong. They managed to be stronger than they thought, while still keeping their insecurities. This made them completely believable characters that I rooted for with a vengeance! I try to imagine myself stuck in a situation like this, and I hope to be 1/10th of the person that Cass was.This book was so fast paced that there was absolutely never a dull moment. It held my attention from the first page to the last, and I darn-near threw my kindle when the battery died. This is also a book that I thought about even when I wasn\u2019t reading it\u2026 very few books affect me like that. I am both nervous about and looking forward to the next book in the series. Jason has a way of making even the bizarre terrifyingly real, and this book was no exception. As a Pennsylvania girl, the location of the book hit me a little hard. My home was being invaded!

Jason Brant has taken a fresh new approach to the PA genre. These monsters have some \"zombie\" characteristics, but then he turns the whole \"normal\" apocalypse over on it's head.The story is driven by the two great characters created by Brant. Lance and Cassie are both so well developed. Lance is down on his luck and is such a nice guy (and we all know nice guys finish last) we are pulling for him to survive.

These creatures are part vampire, part zombie. They aren't dead like zombies but they are mostly mindless, rotting creatures. They have an aversion to sun and superhuman strength\u00a0like vampires and they eat and drink people like a combo of both. Brant did a good job of reinventing the zombie and vampire genre.The best part was that the hero and heroine were\u00a0normal people. Lance is unemployed and getting a divorce. He, his wife, and her boyfriend are stuck in the hospital when shit hits the fan. Terrorist have released this virus gas on the US that turns people into vampire/zombie hybrids that have a violent\u00a0hunger. Not much to do but run, hide, and survive in a world that is slowly ending.Lance is not super strong, smart, or intelligent. He's just an average Joe who wants to survive. But he has heart and he's brave even when he doesn't want to be. Cass is a little different. She dresses like a slutty Goth and wields an axe. She's not a real fighter but she plays a good one when it's needed. She has grit and snark, and she's kind of a bitch, which is why I\u00a0liked her so much. That's why Lance liked her too. She's different and exciting.Together they stumble their way through the zombie/vampire apocalypse, fighting the creatures and bad humans that seem to pop up in hoards when the world starts to fall apart. There is a lot of action, suspense, and gore to go around. Devoured was just plain fun and exciting.\nThe Bad\nThe beginning was slow. I liked the story but I am not sure if\u00a0enough happened for me to continue the series.\nThe Snuggly\nThere is a sex scene. Not very sexy or detailed, it just was.\u00a0What else are two people going to do when they might die tomorrow?\nFinal Thoughts\nI am 50-50 on continuing this series. I really liked Devoured and I do want to see what happens next but there are so many other books I still need to read. Decisions, decisions. Still, this book is free so, yes, grab it. It's good. Very recommended.\n\nQuotes\nLance watched as it fed on the three men, moving back and forth between the bodies. It took\u00a0a bite out of one before going to the next, as if it was trying to decide which to feast upon first. \nThe sigh tstretched Lance's mind to its limit. People weren't meant to see such things. His stomach twisted, wanting to spill its contents. He struggled to keep his emotions in check, knowing that his survival depended on staying as calm as possible.\n\u00a0This review was originally posted on Bad Bird Reads"}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8645705-lisa", "userReview": "Gehenna, Tartarus, and Sheol entertained us with zombies in the Old West. The Gate and The Dark made our sleep uneasy with thoughts of horrifying, demonic monsters that had gained access to our world. Now Devoured terrifies us with a new and meaner type of super-vampire that ushers in the Apocalypse.Lance\u2019s life is rather challenging at the moment. The economy is down. He is out of a job. His wife is divorcing him. What else could go wrong? Plenty. Trust me. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever experienced anything as bad as what Lance is about to.A compassionate fellow, he has pity on a sick young lady he sees stumbling through town. When she heads straight out into traffic, he does the gallant thing and tries to save her. As a reward for his good deed, he gets hit and ends up in the hospital. Then the world falls apart. Literally.From the confines of his hospital room, he watches through the window as things go completely crazy outside. Things inside the hospital aren\u2019t much better. Daywalkers, more people who act just like the woman had, are being brought in. Doctors and nurses are attacked. Soon even the other patients are attacked.Lance escapes from the hospital, thinking it will be easier to survive outside. If it is any easier, it is only because there are more places to hide from these ravenous creatures. The need for survival takes precedence over the need for food and water.He teams up with a surprising ally, and together they fight their way through this horde of monsters that only keeps growing meaner and stronger. During the day, they fight off the Daywalkers. At night, they fight off the ones who have advanced to Vladdies.Lance is just a normal, everyday guy who watches as the unthinkable happens around him. The story is told from his point of view. The characters are very realistic in their dialogue and how they react to such a traumatic situation. If you aren\u2019t careful, you might find yourself caught up in the story and so anxious to find out what happens next that you read too fast and skip over something vital.The action never lets up or slows down. If you want to read a book where you can\u2019t wait to see what happens on the next page, then you will enjoy this one. But even in the midst of the terror that is going on, the author manages to sneak in some humor.Things are not back to normal at the end of the book. I\u2019m not sure that things could ever get back to normal if such events were to really happen. The story isn\u2019t over yet though. I wasn\u2019t tempted to throw things when I reached the end, but I\u2019m super excited to read the sequel, Consumed.Remember, this is a horror book so you can expect edge-of-your-seat moments, blood, gore, colorful language, and a desire to hunt down the author and demand that he tells you what happens next.

It\u2019s based off a short story he wrote titled LOTION, written for Apocalypse: An Anthology by Authors and Readers.The novel starts off with Lance York \u2013 a man who, by his own admission, is a loser. Barely able to hold a job and coming upon an impending divorce, Lance sees no light in sight. Things get even worse for the poor man when, after saving a sickly woman from being hit by a car, he finds himself stuck in a quarantined hospital. Things escalate quickly as the sickly woman makes a return, but as something else. She has begun to mutate, as has many others. Cities begin to fall, the military steps in but proves to be ineffective, and civilization starts its inevitable collapse. All within the span of a day.Lance now has to survive in this newly ravaged world, coming to terms with the drastic changes to his life and assimilating to the new laws of the new, burnt world. It\u2019s kill or be killed now, and Lance, with his new companion Cass who is much more than she appears, decides it\u2019s not him who\u2019s going down.This story was brilliantly written, each scene depicted with such detail and care that it was like a true horror movie in my head. There are humorous parts as well, as is Jason Brant\u2019s signature, timed well and not out-of-place like some novels tend to do. There\u2019s always a good joke to be had when the tension begins to cease, and Jason Brant makes sure the joke is spoken!The monsters in this novel were unique. They\u2019re vampires, sort of. They aren\u2019t your average, run-of-the-mill blood suckers. They\u2019re mutated monsters who have nothing of their past human lives left inside of them except for a few snippets of intelligence \u2013 which only makes them more terrifying. The Vladdies \u2013 as Brant has dubbed them \u2013 can only come out at night, but that doesn\u2019t mean the daytime is safe. Those who were recently infected are still able to roam in the light, and prove to be a threat bigger than you\u2019d expect. No time and nowhere is safe from these creatures, and though things look bleak Lance and Cass trudge on in the hopes of finding salvation.I sincerely enjoyed this book and positively can\u2019t wait for the next one!"}, {"userName": "Gadget Girl", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23283946-gadget-girl", "userReview": "This was the first book Ive read from Jason Brant and it wont be my last. I had downloaded this for free quite awhile ago but only just got round to reading it. What a fantastic fast paced read, I was hooked and completely sucked into this fast paced storyline from the very first page...why on earth...hadn't I read this earlier...doh!If you love your zombie dystonian horror and gore you so need to read this next as its quite different to your normal zombie-esk reads. These monsters are a horrific combination of zombies and vampires similar to those of the Blade trilogy with larger bodies and more grotesque features making these creatures almost impossible to fight and so much more terrifying.What's great about this book is that most of us can relate to or know someone like Lance who is in a really bad place, with a nagging wife, not enough money and is feeling quite down. Jason has made us as the reader really feel for this guy as he's so realistic and completely believable. I was almost shouting at the screen when I discovered more about his scheming wife...no more spoilers here...grrr.Its been brilliantly written and I was completely sucked into this storyline and I absolutely loved watching Lance develop naturally throughout the book from this downtrodden guy to a more confident ass-kicking hero which is so convincing. Part of the reason for this new found confidence was Cassie who saved his butt from not just the night and day-walkers but the Militia (its not just monsters to be scared of out there).She is a likable, cocky young woman who is confident and strong not scared to kick ass when needed. Girl power at its best...yesss! However her constant use of the word \"dumbass\" aimed at Lance was actually getting on my nerves as funny, quirky and likable as she is; even though it ends up as a term of endearment.We watch Lances confidence grow as the two of them fight together to get to the national safety point and of course this isn't going to go easy or is it even going to be safe?I found myself speeding through this book unable to put it down; another 6am finish on this lol!

I found the book a very fast read, finishing it in one day and part of a night of reading.There is a very out of shape hero. He is far from an expert in weapons or unarmed fighting techniques. He has watched alot of television and movies, so he is acquainted, at an intellectual level, with the issues around a zombie apocalypse. This is good preparation because that is what he wakes up to in the hospital near the beginning of the book.The monsters in the book are not strictly zombies, they are a zombie-vampire hybrid. They have problems with bright lights and the sun when they have undergone full transformation. There are what the hero calls daywalkers, who are on the road to transformation, but are not in the final state. The final monsters are overwhelmingly dangerous and are a challenge to heavily armed military units. Another villain in the story is uninfected humans who descend into barbarism and self serving evil.After several days of difficult1y with all the villains mentioned, with the addition of stupid bureaucrats and poorly organized military types, our hero finds a great partner in the form of a beautiful, sexy babe with a big axe. Think of Buffy as a yuppy artist. The two fight their way through the city of Pittsburgh in the attempt to survive the end of civilization.I found the book adequate to mostly hold my attention, but did not notice anything that made me want to read the next one in the series. I have never read any other zombie story, not counting I am Legend from 1950, so I don't know how fans of the genre would like this story. I suspect aficionados of the genre might find the story routine and predictable, but only they can judge.

Chaos takes over and Lance finds himself smack dab in the middle of a new Pittsburgh, one that's overrun by daywalkers and Vladdies. But even uninfected people can be enemies and Lance is forced to do what he must to survive while still maintaining his humanity.Although the beginning is a little slow, once the action started, I couldn't put the book down. Brant has a gritty writing style that really brings life into this story while still injecting it with some great humor. Yes, it gets a little gory at parts, but it is a horror novel, so that's to be expected. I loved that the conflict came not only from running from the infected but also from some opportunistic humans and Lance's desire to do the right thing. Lance was a great character. His \"every man\" point of view definitely added dimension to the story. My favorite character, however, was Cass. She is Brant's most well-developed female character yet and I found her to be relateable, funny and just the right amount kick ass.

Despite his self-described shortcomings, feeling like a miserable failure and suffering from depression, he continued to strive to climb out of that hole. The dissolution of his marriage is heartbreaking at times, and I couldn't help but feel for him as he tried to cope with it on top of everything else. The character, as a whole, is another shining example of the author's skill at creating a hero from the underdog.The monsters creating all the havoc for our hero are unsettling, to say the least.

The main character in Devoured, on the other hand, is the ordinary guy in the street. A bit of a loser according to his `charming' soon-to-be-ex-wife, and even to an extent, himself, but when the world starting crumbling, he became the person we will all want on our side when the odds are stacked against us.The creatures in this book are not zombie as we know them, they are different in a few very important ways - and are terrifying.Devoured is the first book in the series - `The Hunger' - no cliffhanger, thank goodness, just a very good book with lots of action, surprises, terrifying moments, and as we have come to expect from Jason Brant - humor.

What would you do to survive? Lance is a guy who is down on his luck. He is jobless and in the process of getting a divorce from his wife. He more or less is feeling sorry for himself. In an act of heroism he tries to save a woman's life, only to end up landing himself in the hospital. Then all hell brakes loose as a deadly plague hits the USA. I am a big fan of Jason Brant books. This one is right up there with all his other books. Yes, it is full of gore as usual, but not to the point that it makes you ill. As I have come to expect he adds his own little bit of humor to his book, and I could see some of his personality in his characters. It is also well-written. There is none of those horrendous grammar or spelling errors I have found in other indie books. This one is well worth the price. Especially for those who are fans of thriller/ apocalypse genres."}, {"userName": "Rene Folsom", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9083028-rene-folsom", "userReview": "This is definitely another fast-paced, action-packed thriller from the talented Jason Brant. Lance starts out as a whiny shell of a man, and for good reason. His life is in the toilet. Yet he continues to try and survive in a world consumed by monsters who go bump in the night. The story really gets interesting when Lance meets a sassy, strong female who is dead set on giving him a run for his money. Not only is Cass awesome, but she makes Lance a stronger man as their relationship they quickly develops and keeps you glued to the page while you follow them through this new world of chaos and destruction. I can't wait to find out what happens next on their journey."}, {"userName": "Cedric", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51377295-cedric", "userReview": "A plague/zombie invasion? This book is an amazing book with lots of action. The story is a about a man named Lance and his life is going horribly. When he thinks that his life could not get any worse it does. Lance has to try and survive in the outside world trying to not get eaten. I think that the book was great. Its very suspenseful and also scary at some parts.

It was all about the girl on the cover.Yeah, the girl on the cover. She pops up only at about 55% of the book. First it was all about Lance and I didn't like Lance, especially at the beginning of the novel. He's in his mid-thirties and can't hold a job (kind of a familiar situation), his divorcing his wife (not my case) and he's in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. Oh yeah, he's impotent. Really, at first he was hard to put up with him. When Cass appeared, everything improved.Let me get straight one thing first: Cass is the typical female character created by a man. She doesn't feel right; she's just the creation of a male mind. I mean, is there a girl out there ready to fight zombies in mini-skirt? So you have to worry about not just being killed but also not flashing at the same time. Not believable, sorry. She comes off as a sort of robot ready to kill everything on her path with an axe.Maybe a little more explanation of the monster thing would have been useful. At the end of the book the reader still don't know the why and how of the zombie apocalypse. S/he knows they change really quickly and become a sort of gorilla crossbred with three others types of apes.The scariest part? The one about the militia... Men are actually more dangerous than gorilla-zombies...Let's start with book #2 and I'll se where all this is going."}, {"userName": "Jamie Goheen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72230359-jamie-goheen", "userReview": "I read this a few months ago but I'll add my review before I read the rest of the series. I enjoyed this novel. It is very unique. The 'zombie' genre is filling up but this author has a very different take on the concept. I'm also familiar with Pittsburgh so that added an extra layer of interest for me. The book was exciting. It isn't great literature or the sort of book that provokes emotion or extreme attachment to the characters but it is an interesting story. It is very fast-paced and the author does a great job of creating plausible motivations for his characters. I pay a great deal of attention to such things because fantasy is the genre closest to my heart. Obviously the settings in the fantasy genre are not part of reality but motivations and feelings/emotions are still understandable. This novel started with the main character having the mother of all bad days and circumstances really didn't improve for him. He did meet a great woman though and she is even more capable of taking out the monsters than he is. I would recommend this book for a fun and exciting read. I plan to start the second book in the series today."}, {"userName": "Cheryl Earle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51293747-cheryl-earle", "userReview": "This is a five star apocalyptic read of what should be a stunning series!I'd been plodding along reading my normal fare and I was becoming quite bogged down and losing interest in reading when I decided to give this book a shot. O.M.G. ..... best decision ever!It is one of the best apocalyptic stories I have read. I opened the first page and before I knew it I was done and looking where the rest of it was. Fair warning - it does sort of end with things up in the air, not necessarily a cliff hanger, but you're definitely left salivating for more, which follows on in book two of the trilogy.It would be unfair to call it yet another zombie book. For one, the infected don't die and there's a nice distinction between the recently infected and what turns out to be those changed completely by the Xavier virus. One rule the day, the other the night - basically you're stuffed however you look at it. Towards the end you realise that things may be about to become a lot worse when changes are noticed in the \"Vladdies\" by our protagonist. Brant has an interesting collection of characters that leave you wondering who exactly the real monsters are? I have read another book by the author and he does seem to love the underdog ...... and so do I.The goodies, the baddies, the misguided, the monsters and the monstrous .... it has everything. Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Katherine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64177366-katherine", "userReview": "This is a surprising little gem of a read, I really was surprised by how fun it was. I understand the girl on the front cover is the same as the girl on Chrissy Peebles books but I a assume she is a favourite to use, anyway we are not here to judge the book by the cover.Lance as a character is pretty relatable because quite a lot of people have been through depression, breakups, divorce and unemployment. He really isn't in the best of positions to start off with and then forced to face vampirism fuelled mutations with nothing more than a shotgun and an army knife. I like how he tries to make the best of a bad situation despite what has happened to him and what is happening.I know the survival story has been done many times but I find this to be a little different, the infected are more like mutated vampires. This gives it a 'Last Man on Earth' / 'I Am Legend' vibe to it but with more survivors. I love post apocalyptic zombie novels but this is refreshing to have another type of infected person/danger that is that much harder to get away from."}, {"userName": "John Gibbons", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13995742-john-gibbons", "userReview": "I have told myself that I would restrain from giving 5 stars unless absolutely earned. In my view a 3 star is a pretty good rating. Jason Brant has earned a 5. The book's pacing and prose was tight, with just enough description that it Didn't bog down the action. I usually would yawn at apocalypse stories as the heroes are usually a Green Beret or some shit, so it was refreshing to have a Joe Nobody as the hero. The author also does a swell job of balancing the action between the monsters, both human and inhuman. This would make a great movie, and I have to say is my second favorite apocalypse story next to Blood Crazy by Simon Clark.

Pittsburgh resident Lance York is down on his luck and things take a turn for the worse following a failed job interview. He saves a sick woman who turns out to have a nasty case of the plague and wakes up in hospital. The story follows Lance as he lurches from on crisis to another whilst trying to survive while the plague spreads like wildfire. Along the way he comes across a variety of people, good and bad. And so on.This is a straightforward end-of-the-world caused by plague/virus novel. Jason Brant tries to twist is slightly by giving a different take on the \"zombies\", so kudos to him for that. However, there's no getting away from the fact that there's nothing new here. Brant keeps it simple and his style works well for this kind of novel, although there is some terrible dialogue and monologue. Unlike some serials, the ending leaves it open for a sequel without leaving everything hanging.As a footnote, I couldn't help noticing that the cover is almost identical to Jenny Undead apart from the text and the woman's hair colour."}], "description": "Alternate cover edition for ASIN  B00DPK3D0G.Day One: A series of terrorist attacks spread a cloud of noxious gas over highly populated areas.
