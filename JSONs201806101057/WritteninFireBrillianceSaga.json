Overall, the series was creative and an excellent spin on the \"superheroes among us\" genre. When I read the concluding story to any series, I expect it to go out with a bang. It needs to wrap up the major issues with a great climax and either close off the universe or leave it open for more.  Written in Fire  has left room for more stories within this universe and has plenty of big bangs but in the most important areas, the bangs were too often squeaks. Plot Summary The story continues in the world inhabited by \"normals and brilliants\" as conceived by Marcus Sakey originally of Flint, Michigan. If you have seen the news lately (lead laced water scandal) its nice to have something positive with a connection to this downtrodden city.Nick Cooper, former government agent and tier 1 brilliant, continues his quest for vengeance and for peace between normals and brilliants. At time where tension between the groups is at an all time high, the world is confronted with a serum that will turn a normal into a brilliant. All of the warring factions want it for their own reason. Unfortunately, the serum is not stable and neither is the serum's inventor. Nick must seek revenge while confronting the new dangers this serum presents to world. My Take  Written in Fire  is a mixed bag. On the positive side, the author has created a compelling world with a truly unique (at least to me) take on the \"superpower\". Each gift that a brilliant has seems entirely probable. Gifts occur as a result of advance pattern recognition which have developed as some type of evolutionary step. No one is flying, moving things with their mind or shapeshifting yet these changes in humanity have lead to major advancements in most all areas of study and science. This is the greatest strength of the book and the series. The ability of the author to take something as unbelievable as \"superpowers\" and to integrate into a reality that requires little suspension of disbelief, is itself superhuman. I enjoy science fiction that feels like it would be possible. If you feel the same, you are likely to enjoy this series.In addition to the great setup, the author did a great job of weaving the underlying, sinister plan from beginning to end. The reader is lead down the path of obfuscation and misdirection and is none the wiser. I thought the underlying plot was very well crafted and never left me feelings cheated or disappointed. On this front, the author receives high marks for wrapping up the various scheming and conniving.So why did I feel some disappointment with the concluding volume. Were this the second book in the series, I would have been more generous with my rating. While I was content in the completion of the storylines, there were several confrontations that were destined to occur. The first two books set a high expectation for these final collisions. Instead of a violent crash, we were given a fender bender. While much of the series has been quite inspired, the character resolutions were not. While the plot was strong, character and emotional resolutions need improvement. Leave me happy or angry with resolution but don't leave me feeling ripped off. Had these necessary collisions been more fulfilling, the novel may have been the best of the bunch. Can this Novel Stand Alone  Not a chance. While the novel does an admirable job of bringing you back up to speed, there is a sea of history you will need to appreciate the finale. Final Thoughts Overall, this series is well worth your time. If you have read the first two, you will not want to miss the conclusion. The strength of the Brilliance universe and strength of plot redeems the novel's missteps. While I am disappointed for what was not, I enjoyed what was. As an added bonus, the ending leaves open the possibility that we may see future novels within this world. I for one, would welcome more.Content AdvisoriesIt is difficult to find commentary on the sex/violence/language content of book if you are interested. I make an effort to give you the information so you can make an informed decision before reading. *Disclaimer* I do not take note or count the occurrences of adult language as I read. I am simply giving approximations.Scale 1 - Lowest 5 - Highest Sex - 2There were a couple of sexual encounters but they were quite tame. They were of the variety that cut away from scene before the real action begins. Language -F-words - 5 instances Mild Profanity - 41 instances Religious exclamations - 11 instances Violence - 3.5There is violence throughout the story. The story is essentially that of a war. There is lots of shoot and lots of dead bodies. While this accounts for much of the violence, it tends to avoid graphic descriptions. There are some scenes of torture which are moderate graphic but short."}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review. Many thanks to NetGalley and Thomas & Mercer for making it available.Boy, do I hate it when a book series ends...I devoured the first two books in Marcus Sakey's fantastic Brilliance trilogy, so I both eagerly anticipated and dreaded the arrival of the last book in the series, \nWritten in Fire\n. I've finally caught my breath, as the action and the tension intensified as the book drew to a close!One percent of the country's population is composed of brilliants, those with extraordinary physical, cognitive, emotional, and/or perceptive gifts. But despite these talents and abilities, these so-called \"abnorms\" have been feared, reviled, mistreated, and targeted for all kinds of abuse in the 30 years since their discovery became public knowledge. This mistreatment has brought the country to the brink of civil war, norm vs. abnorm, in a battle for the very heart and soul of society.\nWritten in Fire\n begins with the country reeling from a devastating attack by the abnorm community. This has led to laws which require that all abnorms be microchipped for easy tracking, but even worse, lynch mobs across the country are targeting and killing them simply for being different. But the country still wants more, still wants retribution. While secret plans are being hatched within the U.S. government, a citizen-led militia of thousands of people is planning to attack the settlement where many of the abnorms live. And in the settlement itself, the most notable abnorm\u2014a brilliant terrorist unwilling to stop until the world realizes the absolute power of brilliants\u2014plots ultimate chaos and destruction.Nick Cooper, a former detective who used to hide his own abilities as a brilliant to help the government track others like him who wished to do evil, understands why his fellow brilliants are angry. But at the same time, he cannot allow the world he knows, the world in which his family lives, to be destroyed by civil war. He'll do everything he can to fight his old nemeses to bring an end to the forces which want to harm the country\u2014no matter what the cost.While this book is tremendously imaginative, much of its plot rings eerily familiar to current circumstances, with so many people fearful of all Muslims, demanding they be tracked, barred from entering the country, even killed. But this book explores both sides of the argument: Should years of mistreatment and abuse justify violence and destruction? Is it right to categorically fear what we don't know or understand? Is self-defense really a valid argument for attack?What I've loved so much about these books is that Sakey balances thought-provoking plot, pulse-pounding action, and truly complex, memorable characters, even the villains. By the third book I found myself truly attached to these characters I feel I've gotten to \"know.\" Much like some other series, this book is definitely a bit darker than its predecessors, but that didn't dull my enjoyment in any way. And while I often feel books in a series can be read out of sequence, I'd definitely recommend picking up \nBrilliance\n, the first book, first, and then reading them in order to feel the full power of Sakey's storytelling.I won't soon forget this series, and I'll be interested to see what Sakey comes up with next. But in the meantime, I'll miss Nick, Natalie, Shannon, Bobby, Ethan, John Smith, the Epsteins, and so much more. Don't pass these books up.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo...."}, {"userName": "Faith", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17430801-faith", "userReview": "I thought that this final book of the trilogy was a little better than the second book (which I thought was mainly a placeholder) but not as good as the first book. I don't think that there was enough plot for three books, but trilogies seem to be the norm these days.I was particularly troubled by a few things in this book. Among other things, the annoying love triangle was, unfortunately, still ongoing. The characters spent a lot of time explaining their positions to each other. The author resorted to the awful cliche of having a character, when confronting his target, pause to chat with him rather than just shooting him. Cooper, while conducting a commando raid, actually forgets he has a gun and just watches as one of the abnormals pulls one of his stunts to thwart the attack. The explanation of John Smith's actions made no sense at all. The chaos he caused over the course of several years (and three books) was completely unnecessary for him to achieve his ultimate goal. Maybe they will fix some of these weaknesses in the inevitable movie, but I doubt it. Ultimately, I thought these books took a good, but not terribly original, idea and dragged it out too long. There were too many lapses of logic along the way.I received a free copy of this book from the publisher."}, {"userName": "Blake Crouch", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52535740-blake-crouch", "userReview": "Beginning with Brilliance and A Better World, and culminating in the pitch-perfect trilogy-finisher, Written in Fire, Marcus Sakey has created an astonishing achievement\u2014a portrait of our world five minutes into the future.

While the premise isn't overtly original (substitute \"brilliants\" with \"mutants\" in any X-Men comic and you'd have pretty much have the same story), the execution and colorful characters really made the whole thing gel. It was a smart thriller series and a lot of fun to read.The end to the trilogy for me, however, sucked all the fun right out of it. I felt this book fell into so many cliches, from terrible dialogue to hero journeys to an end of the world scheme through weaponizing a flu virus (wow, are we back in the 90's?!?). If the first book in the series had read like this one, I wouldn't have stuck around for more. Add to it that much of the technological aspects, which were cleverly researched in the first two books, were just passed over in this one. It felt hurried, under-developed, and more like a draft than a final product.It's sad to see a good thing end but worse to watch it go down in flames. Sadly, if there is another book in this series (which there probably will be) I won't be jumping along for the ride. 2 1/2 stars out of 5."}, {"userName": "Joe Slavinsky", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51527381-joe-slavinsky", "userReview": "I don't have a lot to say about this roller-coaster thrill ride, as I'm still gasping for breath.

And exciting it was! I listened to this on audiobook while working out, and it made me want to work out longer just so I could continue the book. Luke Daniels is a phenomenal narrator, and one of my favorites. Where we were left off at the end of book two was quite intense. White House destroyed? Check. Multitude of dead? Check. Encroaching Civil War? Check. This can't possibly end well, can it? Nick Cooper has got his hands full. The Brilliants versus Non-Brilliants controversy has reached its pinnacle, and if there is a way for the United States to avoid a full-blown war and an even greater death toll on both sides, Nick is going to have to dig deep, along with his cohorts, and come up with a solution. Sorry Nick, no rest for the weary.I found this conclusion to be entirely engaging and exciting. I loved Nick Cooper and getting his perspective. Nick isn't perfect, and his personal life was a bit of a mess, but he so genuinely wants to do the right thing for the world, and for brilliants and non-brilliants alike, that his humanity shines through. He's the kind of protagonist you can't help but root for. We also get some great perspectives from other characters, really rounding out the story, whether from good guys or bad guys or just characters with insights that really made you think. I also appreciated that the conclusion wasn't wrapped up in a nice bow. Life isn't that simple. But the things that were resolved were terrific.

Terrorist John Smith wants the persecution of brilliants/twists to stop, and seems to be several steps ahead of everyone by grabbing some scientific research. Meanwhile, a ragtag group of militia are making a move on the New Canaan Holdfast of billionaire Erik Epstein using unorthodox means to combat the defenses. Our hero Nick Cooper has to intercede to stop the escalation into all-out war. I found this last book a little slow at times, caring not a whit about the militia nor about Nick's feelings for his ex-wife and killer girlfriend. I liked the further development of Soren as a character, but felt Millie's role was marginalized.

The first book in this trilogy Brilliance ranks as one of my favorite books of all time and although Written in Fire does not reach the heights of the first novel, it comes darn close. Part Science Fiction, action thriller, with a dash of futurism, politics, psychology and military action, the entire Brilliance Saga is a thinly veiled allegory of human nature and society\u2019s innate ability to unite and turn against the metaphorical them. In this, Sakey explores the divisions of our society, exposes the faultlines running through civilization and pokes at them such that the veneer of civilization melts away , leaving the reader with borderline chaos. It is the flirtation of the abyss that makes Written in Fire so compelling, almost like watching a train wreck happen and being powerless to stop it. Coupled with brilliant (pun intended) characterization driving the plot along, Written in Fire accomplishes the impossible and closes an already spectacular trilogy out on a high note.For the uninitiated the Brilliance trilogy is focused on the appearance of a group of people known as the abnorms or brilliants. Starting in the year 1980, one percent of the world are born with amazing, savant like gifts, ways of thinking, organizing information, cataloging of data, reacting differently to surrounding stimuli etc. They were not born with Xmen like powers, i.e, no one is shooting optic blasts out of their eyes or manipulating magnetism, but the most powerful Brilliants possess the ability to quickly sense patterns in the stock market, thereby crashing the market, or being the tactical equivalent of Hannibal, Julius Ceasar, Alexander the Great combined. Others have the ability to recognize body language in others, allowing them to discern hidden motives and intentions of other people. While, others are able to identify vectors in a crowd, effectively shifting to where people are not paying attention, thereby remaining invisible. Some are born just flat out geniuses, able to create new technology, see programing code as if it were a simple song etc. Even though the population of Brilliants is small, only about 1% of the population of the world, they are a seen as a threat to the rest of us, the normal, people born without their great gifts. As a result, and as with any minority group they are both persecuted and loved for their gifts while also immensely feared, and on both sides Brilliant and normal there are voices pushing for War, a way to remake the world order with one group permanently dominating the other.At the onset of Written In Fire, the first salvos of the War have already been fired. The White House is a smoking ruin, destroyed by a commandeered missile launched from a US submarine by the Brilliants from their sanctuary in Wyoming. Thousands of American troops laying siege to the Brilliant\u2019s sanctuary have also been slaughtered when the Brilliants turned their own weapons against them. (Unbeknownst to the public these attacks where in self-defense after the Defense Secretary ordered the soldiers surrounding the Brilliants Sanctuary to attack.) Madison Square Garden is a concentration camp, riots are breaking out all over the country, the Speaker of the House is the new president, and food shortages and fear are gripping the country. Brilliants the country over are being blamed for the deaths of the soldiers and the attempted decapitation of the Government, lynchings, beatings etc are now common place. To make matters worse, a rightwing militia bent on revenge is now marching on the Brilliants sanctuary in Wyoming seeking to wipe every Brilliant , man ,woman and child off the map. Yes, this world stinks. All the while there is one hope, as a genius scientist has discovered how to make normal people Brilliants, and a race ensues to find this man before his research can be coopted for nefarious ends.Whew! The board has been set for a great novel and this one does not disappoint. However great the plot, what drives this novel forward is the well written characters. The author does a great job writing believable and real characters, ones that we all can relate to. We intimately know the motivations of all the main characters, their fears, their wishes and what drives each of them. The heroes in the novel are expertly described, their motivations and desires laid bare for the reader to understand and relate to. For instance, driving the main character Nick Cooper, is the desire to protect his family, every action stems from this, it drives every morally ambiguous decision he makes yet as a father it is a decision I could certainly relate to. Cooper also serves as the moral center of the novel, twisted as that may be, revealing to both sides, Brilliant and Human, that sanitized decisions made at the highest levels of power have real impact on the lives of the people the powerful are trying to protect. Torn between both worlds, all Cooper wants is peace and he will fight to the death trying to avert a war that seems all but inevitable. However, heroes aside, the highlight of the novel are the villains of which there are many. The villains are multi-faceted each with come with competing yet understandable agendas. The author takes the time to paint a great picture on each of them detailing what motivates their goals, and why they all think the way they do. As with the heroes of the novel, you know exactly what drives the villains and I could easily see their points of view if I placed myself in their shoes. At the onset of the novel, I thought for instance that I was going to hate the leaders of the Right Wing militia leading the charge against the New Canaan Holdfast, the sanctuary of the Brilliants, but I remembered 9/11. I remembered the rage I felt that day when the Twin Towers were hit, the thirst for revenge at times clouding basic reason. Placing myself in that frame of mind, I imagined a world where in a single day the White House was destroyed, the president and many of the cabinet killed, a world where the Stock Exchange was bombed a few weeks before, a couple of American cities lay under siege by Brilliant Terrorists, and to top it all off, I lost both my sons in the Desert of Wyoming to a sneak attack. Putting myself in their shoes, I felt these people, though still deranged, their pain and what drove them. I may not have liked them or even wanted them to win, but I understood them. This was a nice touch. Even the uber-Villain John Smith, comes across as less a nihilist terrorist but more of a deranged visionary, a man who believes that given human nature the prospects for peace are small, with society\u2019s institutions to corrupt and engrained to embrace the change needed to instill and maintain peace. In his mind perhaps it is just better to burn the whole thing down and start all over. Crazy, but given John\u2019s background the atrocities committed against his people and what he went through, I understood once again where he was coming from. All of the major characters are written like this, you as a reader know what drives them and why, you know their innermost fears, their wants and desires and this makes for a fulfilling book. The characters are not just plot devices but living breathing people. Great job.Sakey also does a great job showcasing the downsides of Brilliance, none moreso than the character of Soren, a character who experiences eleven seconds for every one second of our own. Soren more than anything embodies the tragic character of the novel, a person so cut off and isolated from the beauty that arises from simple human interaction such as simple communication and art that it has made him effectively a monster. Imagine living life never able to comprehend music or even simple communication with your neighbor as their every word or musical note are mashed together in incomprehensible gibberish. On the flip side, we have Millie a reader of amazing power. Imagine that you are able to read the thoughts and intentions of the people around you, but you can\u2019t turn off the power. As such, you are always bombarded with the thoughts and intentions of those around you, inundating you with their wants and desires, always in danger of supplanting your own. Imagine how isolating both of these abilities would be, a point brought home powerfully in the novel. As I mentioned earlier, the Trilogy in my opinion is a thinly veiled allegory about society, and the ability of civilization to turn in on itself and eat its own rather than come together. In the novel we see the brilliants effectively serving as the \u201cother\u201d, a strictly powerful \u201cother\u201d, but an \u201cother\u201d nonetheless. Substitute any persecuted group, in today\u2019s political discussion and you can see how Sakey subtly weaves in the themes of alienation, tribalism, group identification and the human tendency to fear the unknown. Fearing persecution it is only natural for an oppressed or minority group to seek refuge among them, i.e form a minority enclave, which we see happens in the novel, but this enclave ironically only fosters more suspicion and mistrust among the majority. Taking these disparate themes and running with him, Sakey shows that unless we overcome our fear and mistrust of those different than ourselves, we are effectively bringing to past the very future we all claim that we are trying to avoid. We are in a sense rushing towards the abyss with the best of intentions at heart. The fault lines in his fictional society are laid bare and the very idea of community, what it means to be a nation or a country are vividly at stake. Sakey also shows how radical or the loudest voices on both sides of a discussion inevitably drive conflict whereas the voice in the middle, the silent voice in the middle is asking for peace and simply to raise their children in safety. Sprinkling in a little commentary of foreign policy by proxy, Sakey also shows how third party allies inevitably have different goals than their sponsor, a potent lesson for contemporary foreign policy makers the world over. All in all, the themes in this series and book are applicable to our world today in a real and viable way.If I had to fault this book, I would have to say that the ending of the novel and the final cessation of conflict comes across as simply too easy. I won\u2019t spoil it, but I\u2019m not sure that a moment of appealing to the better angels of our nature would have worked as effectively as the novel portends. Possibly, but I am more cynical of human nature. Likewise, the budding love triangle in the novel is tidied up a little to nicely, but it does work. The epilogue though powerful is a little too open ended for my taste. I would have preferred more closure, but that is just me.All in all, Written in Fire is an amazing book and a fitting conclusion to the Brilliance Trilogy. I cannot praise this book highly enough and I give it my most enthusiastic recommendation. This trilogy has cemented itself among my favorite trilogies of all time. Thanks for creating and sharing this world with all of us Mr. Sakey, books and series like this are why I love to read."}, {"userName": "Logan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20455676-logan", "userReview": "This trilogy was enjoyable in the way most action packed summer blockbusters are. However, Written in Fire was the weakest of the three in terms of consistency, logic and overall charm.The first two-thirds of the book was just as enjoyable as the previous two stories\u2014Brilliance and A Better World. Written in Fire suffers from serious issues with characters completely diverting from their originally established personality traits, and not in a good way.I found myself cringing throughout the last 100 or so pages and was glad to have finished this story arc when I did because I wasn't confident in my ability to handle any more of Nick Cooper's heroism. Part of me believes that Sakey simply lost himself in the story and identified with Cooper so intimately that he couldn't help but turn him into\u2013quite literally\u2013the sole person responsible for saving the world. Below are the issues I had with the book, including details that count as spoilers, so readers: consider yourselves warned.....I love reading. Being consumed by a story and staying up till late on a worknight just to finish one more chapter is one of my favorite pastimes. As an avid reader of fiction, I'm able to shelve my grasp on \"reality\" in order to enjoy a compelling story. Rarely do I even find myself bothered by characters making irrational decisions, regardless of if it goes against how their character has been established leading up to a certain point. But dammit, there were just too many inconsistencies here, and in a story that relies on characters following certain paths based on their particular genetic mutation. Eric Epstein, the world's richest man, has made his wealth because he's able to digest vast amounts of data to determine things such as stock futures and coming trends. Shannon is able to \"see\" vectors that allow her to anticipate movement so she's able to move fluidly without being seen. John Smith, other than having the most generic name ever, is a master strategist that never sets himself up for failure (except for that one time he did.) Nick Cooper, our protagonist, can identify subtle patterns within people's twitches and gestures, allowing him to understand their intentions. Soren's mind works so much faster than everyone else's that 11 seconds to him seems like just seem like 1 second to us, which somehow also enables him to quite literally dodge bullets.All of these super cool and interesting things fall apart in the final part of this trilogy, and everything we learned about these people and their unique capabilities is thrown out the window.Here are the things that bother me most about Written in Fire, in no particular order:- Epstein is able to use data to predict basically everything that happens in the world\u2014except for a ragtag militia of non-abnorms calling his bluff on the finger missile strikes, amongst other things. - Speaking of Epstein, the supposed smartest man on the planet is consistently outwitted by non-abnorms throughout pretty much the entirety of this book. - So Epstein and the NCH release a bulletin advising citizens to retreat to Tesla and hunker down for the inevitable invasion of the SOL. Except for the 600+ children living on the outskirts in what's essentially a makeshift refugee camp. (HUH?!?)- Not only that, but of these children somewhere around 300 of them had been rescued from an academy. The other half came from within the NCH and volunteered/were volunteered to buddy up with the rescued children to help with their rehabilitation. I guess these kids were just abandoned by their families who were bunkered at Tesla? - Nick Cooper does too much. He escapes death numerous times, ends the conflict and negotiates a treaty between the NCH and USA, kills all the main bad guys, bangs all of the women in his life without repercussion and constantly does what makes other characters abnorm better than them. - Cooper also gets away with too much. What bothered me the most was the relationship he has with Natalie (his ex-wife, mother of his children and a normal) and Shannon (his sexy little badass spy-chick). Throughout the series he expresses love for both of them. He has sex with both of them. Not once does he show regret for the affair until the very end\u2014when Natalie, who had previously told Nick that he has always and continues to love him, changes her mind and no longer wants to reestablish their relationship. Oh, and she tells him this THE MOMENT BEFORE Nick was going to break it to her that he wants to be with Shannon (probably because she's younger and childless, no doubt). - Other things Cooper gets away with: he escapes death when his heart is punctured, thanks to some kind of voodoo magic medicine or something idk. He has the ear of two presidents and Epstein, with all of them seemingly bowing down and doing whatever he tells them to. The NCH and Tesla is undergoing siege from an invading force that has full intention of killing them all and burning the city to the ground, yet Cooper is able to sneak past the ONE security guy posted at the elevator that goes straight to Epstein's lair. - When the SOL breaches into Tesla, the city's citizens are suddenly able to perform like trained soldiers. Lawyers, bakers, accountants and stay-at-home moms keep their cool under fire and successfully stall an invasion by brutish men of which many are ex-military. - Cooper\u2013who had supposedly made most of his decisions based on his intention of protecting his family\u2013actually leaves his family to go fight the bad guys with his new side chick. In fact, he has no idea where Natalie is when fighting breaks out between the two sides. And he never even recognizes this fact. It appeared as though he simply didn't care, but I betcha he would care if she had been killed and he was suddenly responsible for his kids when all he wanted was to span the globe on special missions with Shannon. - The secretary of defense was able to convince the POTUS and entire JCOS that the military had been so retrograded that there was nothing to be done? He was able to single-handedly give attack orders to a combined force of over 70,000+ soldiers, including Air Force, Army and Marine assets? No. Just...no. Those are ten things that really bugged me about the last chapter of the Brilliance saga. There were several more instances that stuck out, but I think you get the picture. Overall the book wasn't bad. The first 2/3rds was just as intriguing and interesting ad the first two books, but the cheesy lines and illogical decisions made by certain characters in the last act really left me wanting more.

Brilliants have extraordinary senses which can be used in good ways or bad. Nick Cooper, who is a brilliant, uses his skills working as an agent to help the U.S. government track down other brilliants that use their extrasensory powers to commit evil acts. Nick and his partner find themselves tracking a terrorist who has bombed a restaurant, killing many innocent men, women and children. As the investigation unfolds and government secrets come to light, Nick finds himself questioning whether he works for the good guys or the bad guys. 4/5 starsIn the second book in the series, A Better World, Nick became an advisor to the President of the United States. The world\u2019s growing fear of brilliants has escalated due to the activities of a terrorist known as John Smith. Nick works with the government to bring down John Smith, but it\u2019s still questionable which side Nick should be fighting for in order to keep his family and the rest of the world safe. 4/5 starsWritten in Fire is the final book in Marcus Sakey\u2019s trilogy. The White House is in ruins. The President has been killed. Cities have been taken over. The brilliants have become feared and are being persecuted by normal people everywhere. The United States is close to civil war. Nick has lost his job and come close to dying. While working to end the terrorism and stop a war, Nick must find the one person who may have a solution to bringing peace to the nation. 3.5/5 starsNick Cooper is a good hero and the dynamics between Nick, his children, his girlfriend, his ex-wife, his co-workers and even the terrorists are wonderfully written. We care about Nick because he genuinely cares about what is best for all of them. Nick isn\u2019t always right and he doesn\u2019t always come out on top. We get glimpses of how the government, the populace and the bad guys think and what defines their actions. There is always that gnawing question of which side is right. Does either side have all the answers? In the world today, we are experiencing terrible acts between people more and more frequently, whether it is over race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. The Brilliance Trilogy can be applied to any of these as an example of what can happen between two disparate groups of people and how far out of control it can become.While the first two books were amazing, hold-on-by-the-seat-of-your-pants thrillers, this third and final installment failed to excite me in the same way. Most of the great action already happened and there is nothing original added here. It seemed like the storyline grew tiring at this point. However, the series as a whole is definitely a worthy read and even though it\u2019s labeled as a trilogy, the author did leave us with one hanging tidbit that may lead to another book."}, {"userName": "Sally Ember", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15085128-sally-ember", "userReview": "I really liked the first book Brilliance of this trilogy and looked forward to reading this conclusion Written in Fire very much after having read the second one A Better World. I was only slightly disappointed in the second one, in that it devolved into a lot of fighting/conflicts and villains vs. not-villains kinds of tropes and got away from the importance of the premise. But, instead of improving and going back to the story I wanted to know more about---how it was to live in a family, a community, a state, a nation, a world, in which a small but significant percentage of the population were obviously gifted in ways the rest would never be (purportedly)---instead, Mr. Sakey Marcus Sakey decided to go even further down the very uninteresting route of so many sci-fi and fantasy novels these days: violence and sociopathology played out large. It was even worse in this concluding book, which I found so tedious, boring and repetitive that I skimmed all the fight scenesThe romantic triangle (such as it was) was very under-written and overly simplified, with a very neat bow tying it up; not at all like \"real life.\" Since I had brought this one and the second on vacation with me and finished them both, his writing and the stories were gripping enough that I kept reading. Both could have been so much better....If you like sci-fi and fighting, you will probably like this, but it is very disappointing as a conclusion."}, {"userName": "Etienne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11486904-etienne", "userReview": "Cette trilogie est l'exemple parfait d'une histoire trop \u00e9tir\u00e9e.

Spoilers beyond this point, be warned. So I came to the Brilliance saga looking for entertainment. The print/audio book equivalent of a well crafted action movie. I wasn't even looking for Fifth Element or Starship Troopers quality here my friends--just a little brain vacation. The first two installments of Sakey's series did just that; a mashup of Season 1 Heroes and 24.Then book 3 just kind of went of the rails...I mean it's become preeeetty clear that Nick Cooper is (potentially one of many--I have never read his other books) Sakey's beloved Mary Sue. The man does TOO MUCH. Escape death? Check; super-secret-brilliant-science-medicine. \"Get her back\"? Check; Ex Wife suddenly is madly in love with Coop again. Insists on fucking him even though he's been plowing a svelte spy babe a handful of years her junior. \"Get the hot chick\"? Check; I mean--obviously his ex wife who wants to fuck him again is hot. But like; Shannon the 2-D love interest is SUPER HOT. And even though they barely know each other, and he is romantically and sexually involved with his ex wife...Well...Shannon just can't HELP herself. Coop manages to slip by unscathed even after Natalie throws down the \"stand by her man\" gauntlet at Shannon's feet. because OBVIOUSLY. Seriously--I was practically SURPRISED when Coop didn't somehow crowbar a way to have a Threesome in the final analysis. \"Get the ear and backup of people in Power?\" Yeah like: the POTUS (plural), Eric, Bobby (who served his ultimate service as flimsy FOIL character; dying to motivate Coop to go out and beat the \"Unbeatable Man\"...but we'll save that for the next point) And each and every one of them seem to just fall in line with minimal effort. \"Beat the Unbeatable Man?\" Double check. John Smith--the peerless strategic mastermind...erm I mean--not so Peerless? He does get outsmarted and out-planned by good ol' COOP-A-LOOP! I mean--John does get a sick teenager out in the world before our Dashing Hero turns him into swiss cheese. But really--this is the 3rd book in a 3 book series. It ends with Coop having been the near sole savior of the world--on his way to bang his super-model-spy girlfriend...He won ok. And Sorin--the man who can more or less bend time and neatly step out of the way of bullets...yeah--COOP'D :Sigh: I mean I could go on--but y'all have read some diverse Mary Sues. You know how it goes. Part of me sort of delights in seeing a grown man do this so obviously in a popular commercial work.

If you liked the first 2 books (BRILLIANCE and A BETTER WORLD) in the Brilliance trilogy you will also like Written in Fire. The third book has all the aspects of the first two: action-packed sequences, stunning plot developments, surprising character deaths and thought-provoking dilemmas.The former secret agent Nick Cooper is still the main character, but the love triangle between Shannon, the Girl Who Walks Through Walls, and Nicole, the mother of his two children and ex-wife, is even more intense and integral to the plot.However, the stakes have been raised here much higher than in the other books. The World is really on fire, with the White House destroyed, the President killed and civil war has broken out between the 1% of the population that are abnorms and the rest of the population, with neighbor killing neighbor.The key flashpoint is the New Canaan Holdfast (an abnorm refuge taking up about 1/4 of Wyoming) where a vigilante army of norms is amassing to get revenge for the events that occurred at the end of A BETTER WORLD in order to snuff out the brilliance phenomenon once and for all.An artificial way of converting humans to abnorms has been found and both sides are searching for the scientist(s) who created it, with one side trying to get it to as many people as possible, despite the side effects, which appear to be more serious the older you are (and less flexible/resilient your brain is to rewiring).The author does an excellent job of putting our characters in situations where there are no easy ways out and where bad things will happen to good people. This is one of the best parts of the book because the moral quandaries are very thought-provoking.I don't want to spoil the ending but it seems like the author wants to have it both ways. It is unclear as to which side wins in the end; in fact it's not clear to me which side I WANTED to win.(One side says abnorms should take over the world because they are the next evolutionary step of humanity and the other side says abnorms should be microchipped and exterminated to preserve humanity as we know it.)

Here's the thing every time I've talked about this book with someone I always end up circling back to what I consider a giant hole in an otherwise pretty tight storyline so as opposed to speculating I'll just ask the question.....

Or at least it started out that way. The first book has its flaws, but it's a very entertaining story that reads like a 90s action movie. I enjoyed it enough to read book 2, where the story begins to lose steam and a lot of the flaws in the writing become more evident. By book 3 it's almost painful. There's plenty of cliches and ridiculous plots. The internal monologues are agonizingly repetitive. You know the old advice \"show don't tell\"? Sakey has clearly never heard such advice. Every time a character thinks of another, they end up thinking a full recap of all plots involving that character. For example (spoilers for books 1 & 2 ahead), when Cooper needs Shannon's help, he always thinks something like \"Shannon...who he'd previously called the woman who walks through walls. Who he had made love with. Who had saved his wife and kids...\" etc. This type of monologue happens multifarious times throughout the trilogy, regardless of which character is thinking or who they are thinking about. It's not limited to thoughts about characters either. If a character is thinking about a situation, he/she also does a full recap of everything related to that situation. It's so overdone that it becomes comical after a while. Much of the plot seems like it exists just to fill another novel when this probably could have been wrapped up more smoothly just by making book 2 a few dozen pages longer. Overall I'd give the trilogy 3 stars, but this is by far the weakest of the three."}, {"userName": "yoav", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61849316-yoav", "userReview": "This is the third book in the \"brilliance\" trilogy.

But it is written in fire or more exactly drowning in an endless mumbo jambo, every thought or a feeling that a catcher has, is describe in length, as a flashback to the past that is basically summering everything that was happening previously (is Natalie frightened, it can't be, she was a brave girl, but then she got married, had children her ex did this and that so no she isn't afraid for her self but that her kids won't have a mom - and this go on for three pages!). One of the characters is gifted in a way that every second for us feels to him as 11 seconds - Reading this book might be torture for him.
