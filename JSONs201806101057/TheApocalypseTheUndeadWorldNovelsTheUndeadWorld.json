Having read Peter mer Edith's work I tried this series and could hardly put it down. The only complaint I have is how Jillybean is treated. She goes on with a family that takes advantage of her more than love her. I love this author's work and can't wait for more. Also check out his novel Sprite, which challenges this series as one of Merediths work."}], "description": "If you love a bloody good Zombie adventure, don't miss The Apocalypse! The FULL Undead World Series! Greed, terrorism, and simple bad luck conspire to bring mankind to its knees as a viral infection spreads out of control, reducing those infected to undead horrors that feed upon the rest. It's a time of misery and death for most, however there are some who are lucky, some who are ruthless, and some who are just too damned tough to go down without a fight. This is their story. What the readers say about the #1 Amazon thriller: The Apocalypse: \"No frills, just raw and earnest fear.\" David Powel, author \"The characters have depth, and meaning. They are flawed which makes them more believable and infinitely more identifiable...\" Mark Tufo author of Zombie Fallout \"This has everything I love in a good story: interesting characters, vivid details, fast pacing, and a shocker at the end.\"", "title": "The Apocalypse The Undead World: Novels 1-7\n      \n          (The Undead World #1-7)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29089962-the-apocalypse-the-undead-world", "average": 4.75, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1455416697l/29089962.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/224479.Peter_Meredith", "name": "Peter Meredith"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29089962-the-apocalypse-the-undead-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19162258-the-apocalypse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21463064-the-apocalypse-survivors", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22585543-the-apocalypse-outcasts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24714564-war-of-the-undead-day-one", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23353755-the-apocalypse-fugitives"]}
