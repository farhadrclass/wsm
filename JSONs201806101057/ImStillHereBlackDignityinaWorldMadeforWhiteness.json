She writes it clearly and well. And everyone who has not already internalized the message of white privilege needs to keep reading these books until they can understand what it is like to not have white privilege. However, there is so little in this book and in others that might push us forward. And don't get me wrong, I don't mean optimism and hope, but change. I get the feeling in all these books that white supremacy is so ingrained that whatever is done is an indication of white supremacy. and sometimes, I think that's right. But I also feel ready for some books about going forward. A branch of help for those who might want to help.

I had high hopes for her first book and I was hooked from the first page. I had intended to only read the first few chapters and before I knew it, I chucked my plans for the day and wrapped myself up in the pages of Austin's story.By the time I finished reading, I was even more in awe of Austin. I'm Still Here is truly phenomenal.Austin shares how even her very name challenges people's assumptions. People expect to a white man when they see the name Austin; they don't always know what to do with the Black woman before them. She grew up and has worked in majority-white schools, organizations, and churches. And with those majority-white spaces come stereotypes, biases, and prejudices.Austin shares her trajectory from believing she\u00a0was the white culture whisperer after college to seeing how white supremacy infected programs supposedly dedicated to racial reconciliation.\u00a0\"The role of the bridge builder sounds appealing until it becomes clear how often the bridge is your broken back.\" p. 42In chapter 5, titled Whiteness At Work, Austin details the microaggressions she experienced in her average workday at a Christian organization. It was staggering to see them listed out and know this was just an average day. One of many. And then to see how the organization had no interest in changing when Austin pointed out the biases present, despite its supposed commitment to diversity in the workplace.\u00a0It is little wonder why Austin finds white people so exhausting. I can only imagine the bone-deep tiredness that comes after a lifetime of existing as a Black woman in primarily white spaces.\u00a0White readers will need to pay special attention to the sections exploring the difference between white fragility and taking full ownership of facing your own racism. If you are white, you have internalized racism, even if you don't see it. This is what it is to live in a society stacked in your favor from the moment you are born and this is why it's important for us to confront our privilege and interrogate our biases.More importantly, we cannot\u2014we must not\u2014rely on People Of Color to help us do that. As Austin notes, she is \"not the priest for the white soul\" (p. 65.)\u00a0I was very moved by\u00a0Interlude: Letter To My Son. I was also moved when Austin shared about her fears that crop up whenever her husband or dad travels. She worries they'll be pulled over and won't make it home. It's horrifying that this is not an unrealistic fear, that there's nothing we can say in reassurance. It's a profound reminder of why we need to keep fighting for justice and the eradication of white supremacy at every level.\u00a0There are tough truths here but there is also joy as Austin reflects on the gifts the Black church has given her and what she loves about being a Black woman. I loved reading about her memories of her childhood and time with her family, as well as her love for books and the library.Each chapter builds upon the one before it in a way that is masterful. This mastery becomes especially clear in the final two chapters. The last chapter is a reflection on hope and hopelessness and it is precisely what I needed to read for so many reasons.\u00a0\"This is the shadow of hope. Knowing that we may never see the realization of our dreams, and yet still showing up.\" p. 105Then I read the final paragraph and Austin brought it all home and my only thought was, \"holy shit.\" It was that powerful. I read it again and then again and let her words sink in. The whole book builds toward that moment and it is absolutely incredible getting there. Highly recommended.Disclosure: I was provided a review copy from Convergent in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Chanequa Walker-Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6960207-chanequa-walker-barnes", "userReview": "Absolutely breathtaking! Just a few pages into this book, I knew that I had to finish it in one day. Austin Channing Brown does what many of us have been needing for so long: she centers her Black womanhood in her memoir of racial justice, reconciliation, and Christianity. By doing so, she demonstrates what womanist theologians have consistently claimed: when you begin with the experiences and needs of Black women, you articulate a theology that encompasses all. This is a memoir, to be sure, but it is every bit a work of theology, in which Brown makes bold claims about who God is and who God intends for us to be to one another."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9593601-kevin", "userReview": "Some honest, poignant, and approachable conversation on race. I've read a lot of books on race, and sometimes they can be intimidating. The topic is heavy enough, but sometimes the books are academic in nature or are such a high level that you really have to wade through them. Brown's feels much more approachable. That's not to say she doesn't tackle heavy stuff (she does) or have hard things to say (she does) or is intellectually light (it's not), but it just feels very conversational. It's also a book I felt like I needed to read again as soon as I finished it."}, {"userName": "Dale", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4696608-dale", "userReview": "At its core this is a hard book full of hard teachings. This I know - she has many more valid points than I would like to admit.To be published in May of 2018 by Convergent Books.Let me address the title of the book for all of you that will get hung up on the word \"whiteness.\"Let me use a rough analogy to explain it.I am an overweight person. I used to be even more overweight (I have lost 85 pounds). I weighed enough that I had to buy almost all of my clothes online or in special stores. Most major chains literally sold nothing that would fit me. Certain brands make it very clear that they refuse to make clothes for heavy people because they don't want them wearing their brand. Once, I had a salesperson yell at me from across her empty mall store when she saw me walk in that they didn't carry my size (I was looking for something for my daughter).The normal (easy to find, available everywhere) clothing world was not made for me. I was living in a world designed for thinner people.This is how the author, Austin Channing Brown, feels about modern America. It is designed for white people. Period. Everyone else makes large accommodations to the majority while white America makes small ones. For example, in media most television shows feature white characters with maybe a token non-white character. For example, just this month the Marvel movie \nBlack Panther\n came out. It is the eighteenth Marvel movie. It is also the first one with a main character who is not a white man. 1 of 18 is not a very good ratio.Brown grew up in White America in suburban parochial schools. She is not a stranger to the mostly white religious organizations that she has been hired to help with their diversity issues. But, too often, she has been hired as a token hire rather than a guide to how to truly embrace a different part of the body of Christ. It is not enough to get the numbers right.I understand her first sentence of the book: \"White people are exhausting.\" I am a white man who teaches at a majority minority school. The culture of the school is simply not mine (separated by race and at least one generation) and there are times when I leave school exhausted by the constant mental translating I have to do just to keep up. I understood her comment immediately.There are weird things that Brown experiences that I also have experienced. For example, she has white people at work that want to ...Read more at: http://dwdsreviews.blogspot.com/2018/..."}, {"userName": "Christy Childers", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2292055-christy-childers", "userReview": "Austin Channing Brown is straightforward & honest about her experiences as a black woman in America, making this a great addition to the ongoing racial justice conversation."}, {"userName": "Shannon Whitehead", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26009478-shannon-whitehead", "userReview": "There\u2019s much for everyone to learn from this book\u2014the black community, the Church, and the majority culture.

She grew up in mostly White neighborhoods, going to mostly White schools. She didn't have her first Black teacher until college. She has mostly worked for Christian non-profits that were also mostly white. But being saturated in White culture does not change her appearance or make those that are inclined to judge her based on her gender and skin color any less likely to judge her. Part of what has been assumed by many is that if we just get kids a good education and help them 'speak white' or even give them White sounding names as Austin's parents intentionally did, that integration will be made easier. But Austin is here to say, racism is still real. This is a book that needs to be read. Not just by Black Women, although I think that is the primary audience, but by everyone else that is not a Black Woman because those of us that are not Black Women need to hear what a Black woman is saying about the work it takes to be a Black woman in the world.This is not a 'everything is going to be all right because of Jesus' book.

And no that isn't a typo. Austin is a woman who was given a traditionally white male name by her parents in the hopes that her life would be a little be easier when applying for jobs. Austin talks a lot about her upbringing in Toledo where she attended private school and lived in a predominantly white neighborhood. Not only does she mention how her upbringing affected her but also how she was finally introduced into black culture and how she fell in love with the black church. She also talks a lot about her experiences in college and in the workplace, navigating prejudice and so-called \"well-intentioned\" white people.While this book covers a lot about race and how black people are perceived, the thoughts and ideas she discussed weren't things I didn't already know. However, that doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy this book. I appreciated getting to see the world through her eyes, growing up in situations that were very similar to my own upbringing. If you want to learn more about how racism has evolved in America, I think this is a good place to start. Austin's story is very approachable and she mentions a lot of other literature that can further someone's knowledge on this topic.

I literally just read this book in a single sitting (three hours). It is incredible. I couldn't put it down. Austin Channing Brown has written an accessible but honest, raw, no bullshit call to justice and love that holds white people accountable for our fragility and inaction. Seriously, required reading. Here are some of my fave quotes to give you a taste: \"Whiteness wants enough Blackness to affirm the goodness of whiteness, the progressiveness of whiteness, the openheartedness of whiteness. Whiteness likes a trickle of Blackness, but only that which can be controlled.\" Damn. Truth. \"This is partly what makes the fragility of whiteness so damn dangerous. It ignores the personhood of people of color and instead makes the feelings of whiteness the most important thing.... If Black people are dying in the street, we must consult with white feelings before naming the evils of police brutality. If white family members are being racist, we must take Grandpa's feelings into account before we proclaim our objections to such speech... White fragility protects whiteness and forces Black people to fend for themselves.\" \"Diversity gets treated like a passing trend... In the mind of whiteness, half-baked efforts at diversity are enough, because the status quo is fine. It is better than slavery, better than Jim Crow. What more could Black people possibly ask than this? \"Is there more?\" white innocence asks before bursting into tears at the possibility that we would dare question its sincerity. It's hard to be calm in a world made for whiteness.\" \"When white people stop short of reconciliation, it's often because they are motivated by a deep need to believe in their own goodness, and for that goodness to be affirmed over and over and over again... But reconciliation is not about white feelings. It's about diverting power and attention to the oppressed, toward the powerless. It's not enough to dabble at diversity and inclusion while leaving the existing authority structure in place. Reconciliation demands more.\" \"I need a love that is troubled by injustice... A love that has no tolerance for hate, no excuses for racist decisions, no contentment in the status quo. I need a love that is fierce in its resilience and sacrifice. I need a love that chooses justice.\""}, {"userName": "Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1351359-lesley", "userReview": "We\u2019ve seen this before: persistent white refusal to acknowledge structural racism, the softening of America\u2019s racist history, the lone black person as reluctant racism confessor for white colleagues.

Brown poignantly describes the death of her cousin in jail, \u201cI had to reject the notion that my cousin's life was somehow less valuable because he did not meet \u201cChristian criteria\u201d of innocence and perfection\u201d (p 150).

Austin Channing Brown's first encounter with a racialized America came at age 7, when she discovered her parents named her Austin to deceive future employers into thinking she was a white man. Growing up in majority-white schools, organizations, and churches, Austin writes, \"I had to learn what it means to love blackness,\" a journey that led to a lifetime spent navigating America's racial divide as a writer, speaker and expert who helps organizations practice genuine inclusion.In a time when nearly all institutions (schools, churches, universities, businesses) claim to value \"diversity\" in their mission statements, I'm Still Here is a powerful account of how and why our actions so often fall short of our words. Austin writes in breathtaking detail about her journey to self-worth and the pitfalls that kill our attempts at racial justice, in stories that bear witness to the complexity of America's social fabric--from Black Cleveland neighborhoods to private schools in the middle-class suburbs, from prison walls to the boardrooms at majority-white organizations.For readers who have engaged with America's legacy on race through the writing of Ta-Nehisi Coates and Michael Eric Dyson, I'm Still Here is an illuminating look at how white, middle-class, Evangelicalism has participated in an era of rising racial hostility, inviting the reader to confront apathy, recognize God's ongoing work in the world, and discover how blackness--if we let it--can save us all.", "title": "I'm Still Here: Black Dignity in a World Made for Whiteness", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35883430-i-m-still-here", "average": 4.51, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1510037868l/35883430.jpg", "reviews": 122, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14160036.Austin_Channing_Brown", "name": "Austin Channing Brown"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Race", "Autobiography", "Social Movements", "Christian"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35883430-i-m-still-here", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40212393-i-m-still-here", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25891696-today-s-christian-woman---everyone-wants-community", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28062510-today-s-christian-woman---the-case-for-a-creator", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28360689-today-s-christian-woman---faith", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28379163-today-s-christian-woman---why-doesn-t-god-answer"]}
