Solid hardback. I have about 80 copies in the bookshop. 12 of them are supporting the little fridge up to a reasonable height. Two of them are under the cash desk which otherwise would be a bit wobbly. Another 8 (in two's) are against the ends of the four shelves under the galavanise bit of roof where it leaks when it rains hard (not now, post Irma I need a new roof as I have two huge holes in it, so I moved the books) . Sometimes prior to the hurricanes, when it rained a bit everyday and they didn't dry out they got mouldy so I replaced them with some more. I've got lots to spare. I have to be honest though, I've never even sold a single copy.You might wonder why I would buy 80 copies of a book that doesn't sell. I didn't. I acquired them through no fault of my own. What happened was the book was remaindered in huge quantities and I buy from this particular remainder house. Some while back I'd ordered about 8 boxes of books but 10 came. Two of them were full of Fried Green Tomatoes. I immediately got on to the company who said yes they knew of the situation and would refund my shipping costs and the debits on my account. What had happened was that they let one of their members of staff go (customer service, she was a bit... prickly at best and teeth-achingly rude at other times). They didn't exactly fire her they just didn't renew her contract. So to get her revenge in the time left to her with the company she distributed this and other titles (all hardback) to international customers knowing she would have left before we got the books and the shit hit the fan.Cost the company quite a lot of money, but really, you have to give the girl at least 3 stars for creativity."}, {"userName": "Miranda Reads", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71848701-miranda-reads", "userReview": "If you haven't read this yet - get it now.\nIt's funny, most people can be around someone and they gradually begin to love them and never know exactly when it happened; but Ruth knew the very second it happened to her.\n It's a love story, a friendship story and so much more. There's survival against the odds, murder, and absolute hilarity. In short - really, truly awesome.\nRemember if people talk behind your back, it only means you are two steps ahead\nMrs. Threadgoode is at the same nursing home as Evelyn's spiteful mother-in-law. During one such visit, Evelyn stops by Mrs. Threadgoode's room, and soon an everlasting friendship sparks. Mrs. Threadgoode tells Evelyn stories from a not-so-distant past, when racism was rampart and certain home values were taken utterly seriously. She tells of larger-than-life Idgie, sweet and gentle Ruth, and of course a whole cast of truly unforgettable characters. \nYou never know what's in a person's heart until they're tested, do you?\nHer stories give Evelyn a new outlook on life - suddenly, she's not the mousy, dissatisfied middle-aged wife - she's got spunk. She's got character. And she'd be damned if she let one more person walk all over her.\nFace it girls. I'm older and I have more insurance.\n Gah.  It's one of those books that just sweeps you off your feet and holds a special place in your heart forever. It's fluffy, but the kind of fluff that has you squealing with happiness and chasing someone down to let them know how great this book is.I buddy-read this one with my mother and we really, truly bonded over these words. We laughed and teared up at the same parts. This is one experience I will treasure. \nThis book belongs on every bookshelf\nAudiobook CommentsRead by Lorna Raver - and she just brought this story alive. Truly a stunning listen. She had all the right tones and inflections in all the right places. It felt like I was right there in the story."}, {"userName": "Brina", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina", "userReview": "Over the course of this year I have branched out in my reading choices. I have discovered multiple genres that I previously had not read, one of which being southern literature. It is in this regard that I found the writing of Fannie Flagg. Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe invites the reader to small town Alabama. Through Flagg's southern charm you feel as though you are a part of the town and its cast of characters. In this light that I rate this gem of a book 4.5 stars. Fried Green Tomatoes is a movie starring Jessica Tandy as Ninny Threadgoode and Kathy Bates as Evelyn Couch although I have never been privileged to view the film; thus, the book is new material for me. Evelyn Couch is a middle aged empty nester who accompanies her husband Ed to visit his mother at a nursing home. Evelyn having no patience for these visits instead strikes up a conversation with Mrs Threadgoode, which develops over the course of the book into an intimate friendship like that of a mother and daughter. I enjoy hearing older people reminisce about their lives so Mrs Threadgoode instantly became a charming character for me, and I, like Evelyn, was happy to enter into her world. Whistle Stop, Alabama is an almost defunct small town on the outskirts of Birmingham. Mrs Threadgoode, inherently knowing that she is enjoying the twilight of her life, takes Evelyn back to depression era Whistle Stop. She regales Evelyn with tales of her family, the Threadgoodes, and their colored friends, the Peaveys. In a time where people were struggling to make ends meet, the citizens of Whistle Stop appeared to enjoy life to the fullest, with the cafe being the center of their world. Whites, blacks, and people of all walks of life lived in relative harmony, epitomized by Idgie Threadgoode and her Dill Pickle Club who went off on one daring adventure after another. In no case was there a mention of poverty, and Evelyn is charmed by Mrs Threadgoode's stories. Meanwhile, in present day, Mrs Threadgoode urges Evelyn to live her life to the fullest. Just because she has entered middle age does not mean that her life is over. Written during the 1980s era of the working woman, Evelyn is coached on to get a new lease on life, a new career, and enjoy the second half of her time on this earth. In an interview following the novel, Fannie Flagg points out that she prefers older characters because they have many layers to their lives and much advice to offer to younger generations. It is in this mind set that she made Mrs Threadgoode the central point of her novel. Flagg touched on non traditional families, the 1930s modern woman, racism and the lack thereof all in one town. Like Evelyn, I was drawn in by the characters and the town of Whistle Stop and finished the novel over the course of one day because I could not get enough of Mrs Threadgoode's stories. Whistle Stop is a small town whose people make up the fabric of this country, and the Threadgoodes and their descendants are cogs who embody southern life. I enjoyed my trip through Whistle Town and am looking forward to reading more of Fannie Flagg's southern novels."}, {"userName": "Shovelmonkey1", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3926982-shovelmonkey1", "userReview": "This book is fluffy. How fluffy?It is as fluffy as floating on cloud while lying on a mattress stuffed with kittens and simultaneously wearing a pink angora jumper and a candy floss hat. This is the sort of book I enjoy when my brain decides to take a day off. But it is lovely and it is likely that even the most po-faced cynics (me) will be drawn into the warm doughy bosom of this story of love, friendship and adversity in 1930s Alabama. The history of Whistlestop, along with helpful recipe appendices allowing the transposition British readers from the grim north to the Deep South, is relayed to the beleaguered Evelyn by old Mrs Threadgoode. Aside from the odd murder, Whistle Stop is populated by a kind of chocolate-box perfection. It's a modest but model community with great food, the kindness of neighbours, life-long friendships. A kind of Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn wholesomeness oozes from between each page. Living in Toxteth I find it hard to imagine this kind of idealised community of hot-buttered-biscuit loveliness but it was nice to at least try until the piercing wail of a police siren broke the illusion."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/350937-katie", "userReview": "I really love this movie, but as usual, the book is much better and vastly different. In 1985, two women, Ninny and Evelyn, meet and develop a strong friendship. They share treats and conversation while Ninny spins the story of Whistle Stop and its inhabitants, weaving relationships through generations in an enchanting tale of the Old South. The journey is equally important for both women, allowing Ninny to remember and embrace her past while helping Evelyn to accept her past and look forward to her future. Two significant differences exist between the book and the movie; Idgie and Ruth's relationship is blatently lesbian (in the movie they were just close friends), and the racial atmosphere of Alabama was a much more pronounced theme. Flagg's storytelling is bittersweet with many touching moments, and the cast of characters is wonderful. This is a heartwarming look at life, death, love, and friendship, and a great example of Southern Literature."}, {"userName": "Lynne King", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15736557-lynne-king", "userReview": "I saw that a friend was reading this book, loved the cover and blurb and immediately ordered it for my Kindle. When I first started reading it, I thought that it was \u201cinsane\u201d but I soon realised what a gem of a book I\u2019d discovered. This has to be the best book I\u2019ve read for a long time and I have no doubt that I\u2019ll continue to look at it many times in the future.Now where to start with this multi-faceted book? I\u2019ve read quite a few excellent reviews on it and mine may be nothing in comparison but I\u2019ll try and see if I can get my own viewpoint across. It will be very difficult as there\u2019s just so much that one can explore in this book.What are its qualities? First of all, this is a very important social document of life in the south of the United States (Alabama), in the twentieth century. It is also inspirational, poignant, touching, funny, and has black humour: a body is in a coffin at Whistle Stop awaiting removal to another train. Two kids with a camera get involved here and there\u2019s also a broken nose. On another occasion, there's a meal with unknown ingredients in it, and the sauce especially is thoroughly enjoyed by all. All I can say is that it would have been evidence. There\u2019s even a gruesome murder thrown in with unexpected consequences.In addition, there\u2019s the excellent creative structure of the book. I find it quite remarkable how the author handled the time periods between the two main starting dates: the first commencing in 1929, during the Depression, in Whistle Stop, and the second in 1985 from a nursing home in Birmingham. The clever way in which the layers of all the emotions are broken down just never ceased to surprise me throughout.The book concerns four women: Idgie Threadgoode and Ruth Jamison in the earlier period, and Evelyn Couch and Ninnie Threadgoode (the sister-in-law of Idgie) in the later period. It slowly unfurls in 1929 with the simple opening, \u201cThe Whistle Stop Cafe opened up last week, right next to me at the post office, and owners Idgie Threadgoode and Ruth Jamison said business has been good ever since.\u201d This statement was made by Dot Weems from the post office in \u201cThe Weems Weekly, which is Whistle Stop\u2019s weekly bulletin. She gives regular local news throughout most of the book via this bulletin.My favourite character was Idgie (christened Imogen but this was changed by her much loved brother Buddy). One reviewer refers to her as Huck Finn and I agree with that. She is sparkling, feisty, gives wise advice, prefers to dress as a man; in fact decided at the age of eleven that she would never wear a dress again, much to the horror of her siblings. Her tall stories are incredible (a remarkable one about a pond that miraculously disappears), her remarkable loyalty to those she loves, such as her family, Ruth, employees, friends, regardless of whether they are black or white. She was criticized for feeding the \u201cblacks\u201d of the area in the cafe. Her self-effacing manner when she tries to explain to one of them that she would love to feed them in the cafe but there were people in Whistle Stop who would soon put her out of busines. Nevertheless, they could come to the back door.Ruth was brilliantly portrayed and she gets married to Frank Bennett. I just cannot put any spoilers in here. There are two magical parts with the \"bee charmer\" and the ripped out section from the Book of Ruth (which is mailed) \u201c\u2026whither thou goest, I will go\u2026.\u201dEvelyn Couch feels her life is worthless but thanks to eighty-six year old Ninnie Threadgoode, who is living in a nursing home, she rediscovers herself in middle age, loses weight and in addition makes an important discovery through arriving at the wrong church, on a lot of misconceptions she had of the people living in Alabama.When Evelyn goes to a cemetery to look at the Threadgoode family plot, she passes on to another grave and finds an envelope next to the jar of flowers, and inside was an Easter card which stated: \"For a special person as nice as you,Who's kind and considerate in all you do,The fairest, the squarest,Most loving and true,That all adds up toWonderful you\"and it was signed by the Bee Charmer.I could go on and on. The book is brilliant and it even brought tears to my eyes (very unusual for me) on several occasions. I highly recommend this to everyone."}, {"userName": "Nandakishore Varma", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma", "userReview": "Apparently, this is the tale of an old woman reminiscing to a younger one about her life in a small town in Alabama, and the changes which take place as the American South moves from its racist past to the more inclusive present. It can be read like that, and enjoyed for its simplicity, its easy pace, and engaging characters. But perceptive readers who go beyond the facade will unearth a rich treasure of allegory and metaphor: because in this novel, as with any good work of literature, the real story is on the unwritten pages.***Evelyn Couch, a middle-aged, disillusioned woman on the edge of menopause, meets Virginia (\"Ninny\") Threadgoode at the Rose Terrace Nursing Home while on a visit to her mother-in-law who is lodged there - and her life changes forever. For the eighty-six-year-old Ninny is everything she is not. Even though alone in the world, the old woman revels in life, even with the realisation that it may be snatched away at any moment: while Evelyn broods upon a largely uneventful life, Ninny delights in wandering over the colourful landscape of her memory. And as she starts sharing the stories from her childhood and youth, the younger woman gets drawn into the world of the small town of Whistle Stop in Alabama, dominated by the cafe described in the title - and its co-owner, the indomitable Idgie Threadgoode.Ninny, orphaned from childhood, had stayed with the Threadgoodes ever since she was a child - a big, benevolent southern family comprising Poppa, Momma, the steady Cleo, flashy Buddy, feminine Leona, artistic Essie Rue and the incomparable Idgie. Later on, she married Cleo and became part of the family. Now all of them are gone, leaving Ninny alone with her memories, which she shares in typical scatterbrained fashion, and a picture of southern life slowly emerges.Idgie is the centre of the narrative. She has opened the cafe with her friend Ruth Jamison who, we later come to know, is separated from her husband. The food is cooked by Sipsey and Onzell, two \"coloured\" women, and Big George, Onzell's husband. And around this cafe revolves the life of the small town, as it grows, reaches maturity, and slowly fades away into oblivion. Life with all its attendant tragedy, comedy and farce (with even a murder mystery!) flourishes in Whistle Stop.We have Ruth's son, Buddy \"Stump\" Threadgoode, missing an arm but still the heartthrob of the town. We have Jim Smokey Philips, committed to a life on the road when he is not putting in time as a helper at the cafe. We have Artis, Big George's son, the playboy of Slagtown. We have Albert, Ninny's mentally challenged son. We have Sipsey, whose thirst to be a mother is satisfied when she adopts Big George, an abandoned child... the list can go on and on. But they are all the supporting cast. The only one that really matters is Idgie.Idgie, the compulsive liar. Idgie, the hot-headed feminist. Idgie, whose tough-as-nails exterior hides a heart of gold......And as she gets more and more involved in this tale of a bygone era, Idgie inspires Evelyn to find her inner superwoman.***What impressed me most about the novel is its structure. The tale is told in snippets, as the narrative jumps across time and space. Several chapters are narrated by Ninny, while others are extracts from various periodicals (the main one being \"The Weems Weekly\" of Whistle Stop edited by Dot Weems) and some others, straightforward third person narrative but with focus on different characters. It is really like listening to the reminiscences of an old woman who is pretty far gone in years, but whose mind is still remarkably sharp except for the chronology of events.At the heart of the novel is the relationship between Idgie and Ruth: while it is no doubt lesbian, there is nary a mention of sex. Ruth's doomed marriage to Frank Bennet and the tragedy within that marriage is foreshadowed early - but the author drags on the suspense till the very end about what actually happened to Frank Bennet. Through these flawed characters and their tortured relationships, the changing face of America across half a century is brilliantly portrayed.A lovely read."}, {"userName": "Kaloyana",

The movie had its heartbreaking moments, but one was still left with quite a bit of humor and a general feeling of the significance of living life to the fullest. The book featured many more characters (and tragedies!) than the movie chose to portray, and the sadness of some of the stories dragged down the more humorous parts of the book.

So here it goes-Blue gums, Miss Fancy, Naughty Bird, Hogs, Catfish, Blue jays, Whistle Stop, Alabama, Pink Cadillac, Boots, Opal, Dumplings, Fried chicken, Willie Boy, Blue Polka, Flower girl, Dill Pickle Club. Now as much as I loved this book, there are a few things that struck me as peculiar. The understated homosexuality of the lead pair; how could it be so readily accepted by the townspeople? Fannie Flagg never describes it in the sexual context. Apart from the first few romantic interchanges, there are not much detailed descriptions of any personal/romantic communication between Ruth and Idgie. Well without any certainty I can say that this understatement of homosexuality and ambiguity serves a purpose in the way our reading of the book is directed. The relationship seems to spill copiously both in the spheres of a genuine asexual female friendship and a beautiful romantic bond between the two women. Neither can one place it just in the one and not in the other. It is beautiful in both ways and so does it illuminate the prospect and possibilities of bonding between women. How much can they change each other and themselves for the better with greater self-esteem and self-identification. I would consider this book one of the most enjoyable reads ever. A southern kind of story, it is beautiful, warm, and humourous. Makes me yearn for places I have never been, and for a moment in history I can never live."}, {"userName": "Erin \u2615 *Proud Book Hoarder*", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3048260-erin-proud-book-hoarder", "userReview": "[Ruth\u2019s ending (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4821226-nick", "userReview": "Evelyn Couch, an empty-nester woman who is unable to find meaning in her life, finds personal strength and a new zest for living through the stories and friendship of Mrs. Threadgoode, a nursing home resident.  Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe is essentially about the relationships of two sets of women\u2014Evelyn and Mrs. Threadgoode in the present (1980s) and Idgie and Ruth in the past. At the start of the novel, Evelyn has no purpose and finds her life unbearable. Her kids are grown and don\u2019t talk to her, her marriage is essentially loveless, and she has no job or friends. During her visits to see her mother-in-law in the nursing home, Evelyn starts to develop a close friendship with Mrs. Threadgoode, another resident at the home. Mrs. Threadgoode recounts stories of life in Whistle Stop, Alabama from about the 1920s onward. Many of these stories center on two close friends and lesbian lovers, Ruth and Idgie. Evelyn\u2019s and Mrs. Threadgoode\u2019s growing friendship and inspiration from the strength of Idgie and Ruth help Evelyn become a happier, more confident person. The importance of friendship is the central, unifying theme for the whole novel. The story skips around to different times, different cities, and different characters. Yet through all of the changes that occur over time and place, the constant is that kindness and friendship can triumph the many hardships that people might face in life.  Fried Green Tomatoes  is a very emotional book. The characters are very likable (with the one obvious exception) and easy to empathize with. Consequently, readers will share in the emotions of the characters through both joyful and painful times. It\u2019s also hard not to feel a sense of sorrow and loss for the gradual transformation of Whistle Stop from a bustling village into a ghost town. I really enjoyed the book. Other readers my get more out of the relationships in the book than I did. I was much more interested in the story and setting. I was lost in a sort of nostalgia for the caf\u00e9 and the \u201csimpler times\u201d of Depression-era Whistle Stop. Although the book has a leisurely pace, I found that it read very quickly; I couldn\u2019t put it down because I had to know what was going to happen next. I highly recommend it.  Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe will most likely appeal to women who are 30 or older and people who enjoy reading historical fiction or books that take place in the South."}, {"userName": "Gabrielle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle", "userReview": "I know I should feel guilty for loving this book as much as I do. I mean, it only has one measly murder, no mad scientist, no bloodshed and it\u2019s not about the end of the world as we know it... But sorry, not sorry: I just love it. \u201cFried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Caf\u00e9\u201d is just too damn awesome for me to shelve it with my junk food books. Certainly, it is chick-lit: the little Alabama town is populated by people who are way too nice and quaint to be true (even the miscreants have hearts of gold!) and there is a theme of female empowerment that is just a little bit too obvious. But those flaws are easily forgotten by the touching (but never cheesy) tale of friendship between two women, and the poignant (but never clich\u00e9d) love story of two other women.Evelyn Couch is having a mid-life crisis: her marriage is\u2026 well\u2026 duller than rain, she is hitting menopause and feels as if she has let her entire life pass her by. She meets Ninnie Threadgoode at the nursing home where her mother-in-law resides, and they become fast friends. Ninnie is one hell of a story teller, with a sharp wit and a twisted sense of humor. Every time Evelyn drops by the nursing home, Ninnie regales her with stories about her sister-in-law Idgie Threadgoode, who ran the titular Whistle Stop Caf\u00e9 with her \u201cfriend\u201d Ruth Jamison in the 1930\u2019s. The two timelines are beautifully interweaved to draw the engaging story of these four women.The characterisation is lovely, if flirting a little closely with some stereotypes: Idgie can be described as a female Huck Finn, Ruth is every bit the sweet and dutiful Southern Belle, Ninnie is the filter-less old lady and Evelyn is the sad housewife who turns her life around. But that is just their surface, and the book shows them growing and changing, through good times and bad times. What truly matters here is the bond between these women, how they care for and support each other no matter what, and how being in each other\u2019s lives has made them better people. You become very emotionally invested in all four main characters, which makes the book a breeze to read, despite its relative bulkiness.(Rant that contains some spoilers: I saw the movie before I read the book, and while the movie hints at the nature of Idgie and Ruth\u2019s relationship, I had never really caught on to it until I read the book, which makes it completely unambiguous. I re-watched the movie after I finished the book and spent most of it smacking myself in the face for not having figured it out before. I think that Idgie and Ruth being a couple is actually relevant to Evelyn\u2019s arc of the story: these women are an inspiration for her not because they were lesbians, but because they were not afraid of being themselves, and found a family in people not related to them by blood, which is how Evelyn eventually comes to see Ninnie \u2013 as family, not as a romantic interest. The fact that the people of Whistle Stop accepted their relationship might seem unrealistically optimistic, but I think that Flagg wanted to show that you can be accepted for being yourself no matter what that is. It is also my understanding that Flagg expressed confusion about her own sexual orientation after publishing \u201cFried Green Tomatoes\u201d: the small town community embracing Ruth and Idgie regardless of their sexuality might also have been wishful thinking on her part because she yearned for the kind of support and acceptance the Whistle Stop folks and the Threadgoode family show her characters.)Do not let the deceptively simple story fool you: this is a heartwarming book about love, grief, friendship, community and how the changing times affect our lives. Nothing in \u201cFried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Caf\u00e9\u201d is really new under the sun, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less of a refreshing and sweet read that makes me smile and cry. The movie is just as lovely, and I recommend both enthusiastically."}, {"userName": "Francesca", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31502192-francesca", "userReview": "This book is a master class in writing a novel. First of all you have a solid story which takes you down the path and never wanders too far. Every element adds to the story, none of the side plots or extra details take anything away, they just keep adding to it. Secondly you have a cast of wonderful characters who are three dimensional and real. None of the characters feel unnecessary and they all add to the over all feeling of the book. There are two main stories in this book. One is of Evelyn Couch and Mrs Threadgoode in the 1980's. The other is of Idgie, Ruth, and Whistle Stop ranging from the 1920's all the way through to the present day of Evelyn and Mrs Threadgoode. Both stories are full of life, and love, and discovery. They are so immersive that you can't help but be sucked up into the world of the novel. There are twists and turns and fluffiness galore. How a book manages to be simultaneously serious, hard hitting, and fluffy, I have no idea but this book manages it. The book explores many themes. It tackles racism, the wars, feminism, morals, murder, self-discovery, and it serves them all up in a very tasty dish (pun intended). I was so emotionally invested in the characters that I cried several times throughout this book and that doesn't happen often when I read. I am eternally grateful that I was on the balcony of my hotel room when I read the last part of the book, where only my Mum was able to see me full on ugly crying, and not by the pool where all the other guests of the hotel would have thought I was crazy. This novel touched me and I have discovered a new favourite book along with new favourite characters and a new favourite couple (OTP alert!). I can not recommend this book highly enough. It's beautiful and charming and deserves every ounce of praise that it gets."}, {"userName": "Carmine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43396096-carmine", "userReview": "Vivere nella luce La vita va vissuta fino in fondo, senza serbare rancore o alimentare rimpianti per ci\u00f2 che non si \u00e8 fatto.I ricordi diventano un ponte tra il fulgido passato e lo sbiadito presente; la necessit\u00e0 di raccontare passa per l'affabulazione fantastica, la quale impreziosisce normali storie di vita e diventa quasi linguaggio pacificatore per accettare se stessi di fronte all'inesorabile incedere del tempo.Da qualche parte, chiss\u00e0 a che orari, ci dovr\u00e0 pur essere un treno per arrivare a Whistle Stop..."}, {"userName": "Paakhi Srivastava", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14989526-paakhi-srivastava", "userReview": "Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe is a unique book. It has an interesting plot, lots of black humor, a rapid to and fro journey between two completely different spaces and times, glimpses of history and some wonderful characters. Let me take you through each of these:The plot of the story is mundane that grows poignant as one reads through it. Evelyn is an empty nester, menopausal, overweight, neglected wife who meets the 86 years old high spirited Mrs. Ninny Threadgoode at the Rose Terrace Nursing Home. And\u2026 Mrs. Threadgoode starts to talk.... it is through these conversations that the author entices you to have an acquaintance with The Whistle Stop community during 1920s to 1950's. But the enthusiasm with which Ninny Threadgoode introduces the characters is very distracting at the beginning. I could not help but identify with Evelyn who, I assume must have been equally baffled. However, the reader gradually develops a fondness for each character. I marvel at the author\u2019s skill at characterization though, each one is introduced episodically, all the characters seem real. I loved each character and wondered, 'what happened to that one?' I am quite glad that Flagg concluded each character\u2019s life story. The narrative is notable because the flashbacks and flashforwards occur with ease and the transition comes through the \u2018weekly news\u2019 which lends coherence despite seeming discontinuity. Fannie Flagg throws at you this volley of comic instances, intermittent conversations and \u2018weekly news\u2019 wrapped in black humor which all finds resolution at the end. Skirting along an episodic narrative, Flagg broaches the issues of domestic abuse, racial discrimination and depression around that time. Of particular significance is the attitude of benevolence, equality and amity with the then called \u2018colored\u2019 people. This is opposed to descriptions of oppression and discrimination that we normally come across in other books written around the same time as this one. The main premise of the book remains to be of love, friendship and loyalty that go beyond differences of all kind. The same influences Evelyn, to overcome hesitations, self defeating beliefs and doubts that aid in personal liberation. Ninny Threadgoode\u2019s dealing with her arduous life is something that you can take home from the book. It is remarkable that with much ease she takes a lighter perspective on everything. In one conversation, Ninny tells Evelyn with time the differences between a married couple become apparent and how easily you develop liking for them because they are a part of the very person you love. :) Here, I conclude this review and recommend this book which is so full of goodness."}, {"userName": "Morana Mazor", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30488471-morana-mazor", "userReview": "Sigurno ste vi gledali film, tamo negdje u devetesetima..

In this case, I found the movie to be better than the book.I think the fact that book jumped around a lot made it a bit hard to follow. And the ending was definitely bittersweet with so many characters who had lived with each other for decades who ended up moving on when their little town started to die. I guess this book made me a bit homesick and sad, since I see my hometown going the same way. It's slowly dying and eventually I think in a generation it will be almost a ghost town. \"Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe\" begins with a woman named Evelyn who on a weekly basis just forced to visit her mother in law at the retirement home the older woman now lives. She ends up sitting next to an elderly woman named Ninny Threadgood who proceeds to tell her stories about her family and friends that lived in Whistle Stop, Alabama. At first Evelyn feels annoyed this woman has latched onto her, but she soon starts to live for the weekly stories of Idgie, Buddy, Ruth, Stump, Big George, Sipsey, Dottie Weems, and others. I think that Evelyn and even Ninny were developed a lot. Others in the story I wish we could follow up with more. We just got quick vignettes with them. For example, Big George's kids popped in and out of the story, I would even say so did Ruth and Idgie. I would honestly say the character after Evelyn and Ninny I felt was developed very well was Dottie Weems. We are only introduced to her by way of weekly bulletins about Whistle Stop, but her humor and love for the town was great. I will say that the main reason why I just couldn't give this book higher than four stars was the fact that I thought that Flagg kind of took the easy way out not really describing the relationship between Idgie and Ruth. I'm assuming that they were both lesbians or at least that's how the book portrayed them. And that fact that everybody in the small town of Alabama in the 1930s was fine with Idgie and Ruth living together and Ruth's son Stump being called her son I thought was a bit of a reach. I can't see people being okay, but the fact that just called Idgie \"wild\" which I'm assuming was code for being gay was also weird to me. That's the only part of the book that felt kind of false to me. But then I also feel sad because I don't think the movie really showed her as being gay just as liking to wear men's clothes. So like I said I'm just kind of of two minds of how those two characters were shown. I just wish we had gotten more scenes between them. Flagg does also touch upon the racism of the south in 1930s and the late 1980s. I did think she slowly shows that for some people even for some of the so called good characters they still had prejudices towards African Americans. For example, Evelyn realizing that she was just raised to be just scared of black men and when she finally went to the church and got to hang out with more African Americans felt at home I did not find uplifting, but sad. I do think the way that the book just portrayed African Americans in a couple of places did make me cringe. The writing was really good. Flagg can tell a story. The flow got off in the middle. The book just jumps from subject to subject before finally hitting it's stride again.Whistle Stop as I said above reminded me a lot of my hometown and a lot of dying towns in the US. The ending as I said was bittersweet though I was a bit confused by it. We get to see what happened to one character and I'm surprised they were at another location far from Alabama."}, {"userName": "Marieke", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8009682-marieke", "userReview": "My reading of this book has a weird story that goes with it. In 1989 my grandmother came to stay with me while my mom was traveling somewhere for a chunk of time. I don't know where or for how long, but that's immaterial. I was a senior in high school and there was this little \"women's bookstore\" a couple of towns away, meaning I could find lesbian stuff, which was highly sought after by my newly-out pre-internet self. There were other stores on that particular Main Street, so it didn't seem strange that I would be asking my grandmother to drive me there to \"do some shopping\". After arriving, she went off to some 5 and dime or something while I beelined it for the lesbians. I browsed for quite a while, soaking in all that womyn's energy and looking for something to buy. I already had picked up a couple of magazines and wanted a book, too. I picked up book after book, reading the back and seeing if I might want it. When Fried Green Tomatoes was in my hands...my grandmother walked in to get me. That's the book I bought. Good thing I really, really liked it. I was supremely excited when it was made into a movie. While the movie wasn't as good as the book (at the time; it's now a beloved film) it starred Mary Stuart Masterson which really, really helped me get over that."}, {"userName": "Erica", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica", "userReview": "This story is racist as hell.Just in case you were wondering.I'd never been interested in this book or the movie. This wasn't at all my cup of tea when it came out; I was in the middle of my high school career and only reading classics or fantasy and some science fiction. Domestic fiction, especially Southern, was an anathema. I'm not sure why I had this on my Overdrive wish list. Maybe it showed up on its own? Or maybe I've just expanded my reading interests (now I'll read anything that isn't full of romance because: GROSS!) far enough that this fell into my net at some point. Whatever the case, I finally listened to this book that was all the rage for years during my more youthful times.And it's racist as hell.So probably it should be one star, right?Probably.But I can't honestly say I didn't enjoy large parts of this book.Actually, this was a weird read, sort of two versions that happened simultaneously. Putting the story in the context of 1987, it was pretty open-minded and possibly even progressive, at least for white people, specifically middle-class white women. Any non-white American readers at the time would have seen just how shittily this story treats its black characters.Still, it evokes that nostalgia for the years between World Wars, of gritty, bootstrap-pulling characters in a tiny town who get along just fine, where the sheriff is a member of the KKK but runs out another group of KKKers because the fine people of Whistlestop take care of their own, including their coloreds. Pie is served for a nickel, wife-abusers go missing and no one's interested in looking any deeper into their whereabouts, a band of hobos and prostitutes live down by a river (not in a van) but don't bother the townsfolk none. Kids die or lose body parts on the railroad tracks and it's sad but everyone comes out ok in the end because that's just how things were back then. There's a golden glow over the town and not just in Ninnie Threadgoode's rosy, sentimental memories.30 years later, the racism is blatant and loud, covered with that \"I'm not a racist\" veneer that bigoted white people, specifically middle-class white women, love to use. There's lots of \"I have black friends!\"...(so I've been given license to say shit and believe shit I want to say and believe even though I know it's shit) going on. It's cringeworthy and it sucked. And it's sappy, overly nostalgic for something that has never actually existed.But then there's this strong current of feminism running throughout the book. Not third wave feminism, but that coming-out-of-the-dark ages feminism that just seemed to have occurred naturally after the 60's, a sort of after-shock from the first wave. Also, there's a lesbian couple that isn't presented as \"OMG, look how forward this book is by featuring a lesbian couple!\" but, rather, is just another couple among many in the story. I think that, more than anything, shocked me because I don't remember 1987 being a terribly inclusive time for gay folk. Hell, contemporary media still can't treat a lesbian couple as just another couple. I'm sure this book was hotly contested in churchy circles but Flagg introduced Ninnie Threadgoode, octogenarian and devout Christian who loves Oral Roberts but doesn't like Tammy Faye, as an even-minded (racist as hell) moderate conservative, white, former-housewife who is now in a nursing home. How was she received? I don't know because I didn't care about this book when it came out but I think if this were the big blockbuster novel of the summer now, there'd be plenty of bitching about its portrayal of moral decline on Facebook despite the Ninnie avatar.Actually, Ninnie's stories of old Whistlestop reminded me so much of the stories in Big Fish, seemingly tall tales that have been gilded with the patina of remembered better times that were never actually any better at all. There was a strong sense of \"Even though things were hard, people and life were more wholesome back then\" throughout the story; sentimentality at its finest. But that sort of narrative is appealing on several levels; it's nice to think there was a better time, even if we know there really wasn't.I did appreciate the still-relevant topics of aging and the fear of not being young anymore, of first friendships and first endings, of finding oneself, of dying towns and forgotten people. I was also amused that Sipsey's recipes are my family's recipes, I grew up with that cooking. Is it Southern or is that just how people across the nation cooked? I don't know, I just know that that's how I make chicken and dumplings, too.All in all, this is a story well-told with strong characters and an interesting, meandering plot but it really is racist as hell."}, {"userName": "Alex Farrand", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37663070-alex-farrand", "userReview": "This book is about love, friendship, and family. It starts off with a woman named Evelyn, who doesn't understand herself and is depressed, and by hearing an 80 year-old woman's story about Whistle Stop helps her develop her courage and strength. This novel is a historical fiction about the 1930s, so expect to read about racism. There is a mild discussion/example about institutional racism, white privilege, and many, many awful stereotypes. There are actually a lot of \"isms\" in this book that you will be reading about. This book could be classified as a political novel.There are a few things I didn't like:1) The story was out of chronological order. It drove me nuts. We would go to 1936 to 1955 back to 1940 to finish up the story of 1936. One smooth pace please. I understood why some parts were out of order, but I wish majority of it was in order.2) I didn't like the newspaper articles. Sometimes it did help push the story a long and told you of the next topic, but otherwise I just found is useless.Otherwise I liked it. It was funny, and sometimes sad. Very close to the movie as I recall, so bonus. I am so glad my favorite part in the movie was in the book. So glad. Evelyn was the funniest when she was discovering her feminist side. The feminist theories were very prevalent in this book, which I loved. I am very happy about it, because I haven't read much of those in sometime. I also think this book is still relevant in our time, especially right now. I don't want to start a political battle.

The book characters are more defined and the plot is much more rich and long. In the book, you can discover not only new characters but also new parts of their lives. I have to say that in the middle part of the novel I got a bit tired of this deconstructed structure where you move from the past to the present but at the end, I got used to. And of course, the ending, for me is the perfect ending, where you can laugh but also you can cry, two same feeling that I always feel when I watch the movie.

heart-warming story, you can\u2019t go wrong with one of Fannie Flagg\u2019s novels. I should be rating this 4 stars but decided to upgrade it to 5 because I would love to sit down with Mrs Virginia (Ninny) like old friends, listening to her reminiscing, and perhaps try some of Sipsey\u2019s recipes included at the end of the book. Fav.

The tale she tells is also of two women--of the irrepressibly daredevilish tomboy Idgie and her friend Ruth--who back in the thirties ran a little place in Whistle Stop, Alabama, a Southern kind of Cafe Wobegon offering good barbecue and good coffee and all kinds of love and laughter, even an occasional murder. And as the past unfolds, the present--for Evelyn and for us--will never be quite the same again. . . .", "title": "Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/534606.Fried_Green_Tomatoes_at_the_Whistle_Stop_Cafe", "average": 4.27, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320429709l/534606.jpg", "reviews": 4973, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6125.Fannie_Flagg", "name": "Fannie Flagg"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Lgbt", "Womens Fiction", "Classics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/534606.Fried_Green_Tomatoes_at_the_Whistle_Stop_Cafe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/733967.Fried_Green_Tomatoes_at_the_Whistle_Stop_Cafe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9375.Fried_Green_Tomatoes_at_the_Whistle_Stop_Cafe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10332146-fried-green-tomatoes-at-the-whistle-stop-cafe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18266838-fried-green-tomatoes-at-the-whistle-stop-cafe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30342838", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8907670-pomodori-verdi-fritti-al-caff-di-whistle-stop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402012.Fried_Green_Tomatoes_at_the_Whistle_Stop_Cafe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22429449-fried-green-tomatoes-at-the-whistle-stop-cafe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23236936-pohane-zelene-raj-ice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31311836-fried-green-tomatoes-at-the-whistle-stop-cafe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28240733", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17345258-the-all-girl-filling-station-s-last-reunion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84022.Welcome_to_the_World_Baby_Girl_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31493.Standing_in_the_Rainbow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199530.Can_t_Wait_to_Get_to_Heaven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199532.A_Redbird_Christmas"]}
