Ultimately a quick, enjoyable read and even a little scary at times. I loved the inclusion of the graphic novel element and I loved that it mostly kept me guessing. I wished there had been at least one more twist because it felt like everything came together a bit too easily and that the main characters were extremely trusting of this random jackdaw guy, but like I said - still enjoyable.My only real complaint was HOW HARD this author was trying to prove they know Seattle - if I made a drinking game out of the completely unnecessary obscure Seattle references in this book, I would be dead by now. It was insane - and hilarious. It's Seattle, we get it. Except you clearly don't know Seattle because you committed the fatal flaw of saying it always rains/we never see the sun. Really? You reference an old Seattle newspaper that went out of print in 2009 but can't look up basic Seattle weather?

The story main plot is good, even the set up for it came fast that I thought the rest of the novel will be fast packed with actions..alas, it wasn't as I expected..The Story--------Three years after her best friend died, May start seeing the character they created together Princess X everywhere from Posters, Stickers even Graffiti. And an entire underground culture, focused around a webcomic at IAmPrincessX.com.The more May explores the webcomic, the more she sees disturbing similarities between Libby's real life story and Princess X online. Even the drawings was the same of Libby's..With help of her next door computer genius, Trick, they try to unsolve the story behind the site..and the person who running this phenomenon..and hoping that would lead to her best friend, Libby, who lives.It was really fine mystery, but it solve itself after very few chapters, pretty too early..thanks to the Princess X comics that was not-so-symbolic, obviously clearing the story of what happened to Libby after the accident.Then comes the hunt for the 4 keys that would lead May to the Princess X...with a help of don't-call-me-dude-countless-times Patrick who have even a better character set up and development more than May and Libby.The hunt was a bit slow written ,too much describing the places which was fine by me in longer and bit different kind of novels, but here in a YA fun mystery set in real life was a bit longer than it should be.-I didn't mind though the fun described city of Seattle and the fun facts about where Starbucks was started. Or The Fremont Troll, I liked these tours-Also some of the mentioning of the Dark Net interested me, since I encountered with it previously with Stephen King's Mr. Mercedes..and later in Night Film.But even as the mystery and the hunt unfolded and things started to heat up by the cemetery scene... we back to the slow pace writing and even introduced to a new character in length that was in my opinion totally unnecessary.. add this to a typical unrealistic Hollywood climax that was better concluded into faster paced comic better than these many pages.May I didn't feel the novel make good use of the excellent character development of Patrick in the story or may be I didn't feel much the emotional part between May and Libby enough.All in all made me disappointed a bit for such highly anticipated read...since I like some YA Novels,specially when the plot seems original and promising, and the romance part is minor like in this case..but something went wrong for me and even felt a bit bored. So it may be just me, right? May be iI just anticipate it would be faster or more convenient to me.I still would recommend to give it a try if it's promising enough to you..\nTo Princess X, With love,Mohammed ArabeyFrom 11 November 2015to 15 November 2015"}, {"userName": "Beth Cato", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8706020-beth-cato", "userReview": "I read almost the entire book in one sitting.

So, I'm judging this book solely on May's storyline and not on Princess X's storyline since little snippets aren't enough to get a feel for that whole plot point.Disclaimer number 2: This book is NOTHING like Sarah Dessen's novels...not even if you turn your head and squint. So, if that's the main reason you're picking up I Am Princess X (like it was for me), then you might want to steer clear of this book.Now, I don't give 1 star ratings lightly. In fact, I always feel incredibly guilty about giving out 1 star ratings that I tend to just up it to two stars. However, I just couldn't find anything to like about I Am Princess X. I found it all to be a big, jumbled mess. But most of all, I found it to be way too inconsistent to find it in any way enjoyable...or rather May was incredibly inconsistent. One thing (and granted, this one is a minor thing), that bothered me was that she's a teenager...and with that mentality, she should be somewhat tech-savvy. Or at least savvy enough to know that if your frigging computer won't turn on and you think your battery is fried, how 'bout you leave it on the charger and see if it, oh I don't know, actually CHARGES? Common sense! I get that the whole point of that was so that May could meet Trick and get the whole Princess X investigation going, but really? She couldn't have gotten an actual computer virus or something more difficult to solve than \"My computer won't turn on because I'm an idiot who hasn't charged it?\" And another thing: Princess X is supposed to be this whole huge phenomenon that's all over the internet and you're telling me that May, who mentions she has numerous social media accounts, has no clue that something this huge exists? Uh, no. I call BS. Again, May wasn't the brightest bulb. Because the one thing you should worry about when you're trying to find your BFF and numerous people are being threatened and being hurt is what your hair looks like when you accidentally get on TV. May, you're shallow...sit down. And the amount of times the word \"dude\" was used in this book aggravated me...I think I now hate that word more than I hate \"bae\" (and I LOATHE bae). Oh, and you can also find news reports of crimes that have happened YEARS ago without having to resort to printing out newspapers in the library. So May's dad, you sit down, too.I also wasn't enamored by the writing in I Am Princess X. It seemed stilted and forced. I found myself thinking that maybe I would have liked it better had it been told in the first person narrative (especially since May's supposed to be this great writer) or maybe it would've actually made me dislike May (instead of just thinking of her as ridiculous). Princess X (I no longer feel like writing the full title) was also a whole bunch of telling. This wasn't a story that peaked my imagination and made me actually see the events happening in my mind. I don't like flowery, purple prose, but a little descriptive writing doesn't hurt anybody and can be good for the soul. But there were no descriptions here. I was also told every little mind-numbingly boring thing May and Trick did. May walked to get a Coke out of a can...Trick and May walked to get coffee because May likes coffee with chocolate in it because it doesn't taste like coffee...is that coffee going to sprout a human with a katana sword and stab somebody? No? Then, okay, it's not important, so get back to the actual plot. May also didn't pick up one of her father's calls because she knew her voice would sound like mud when she did...what exactly does mud sound like? Really, I want to know. Princess X also had paper-thin development...plot-wise, character-wise, everything-wise.I'm just going to stop here to avoid giving away any spoilers. I will say that I didn't like I Am Princess X. The mystery behind the whole thing could have been slightly interesting, but it wasn't. I didn't like the writing (but the author's written over a dozen novels so clearly other people do) or the resolution of the plot...or the plot itself (despite the fact that it sounded interesting). I say, skip it. (Or maybe check it out and tell me if the illustrations make the story better)."}, {"userName": "Chloe J", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59573555-chloe-j", "userReview": "Princess X is a about a teenage girl named May who had a best friend named Libby,when they were young they came up with a character that they called Princess X and they wrote comics about her. May always wrote the story's and Libby always drew the the pictures, but a couple years ago Libby and her mother tragically died in a car crash. After the incident May moved to another city with her mom since her parents were divorced, and she stopped writing Princess X fantasies. It was a sunny summer day when May came to visit her home town, she started thinking about Libby and went to read some of their comics but then discovered that her dad had given them away, so May went searching for the comics around the city. After many days of searching May came to a stoplight and couldn't believe what she saw, on the metal pole there was a Princess X sticker with a website name on it. Libby quickly wrote down the website name and rushed home to find that her computer wasn't working, and that's what led her to the computer genius Trick. After Trick fixed May's computer May discovered that Trick also had an interest in Princess X. They searched the website together and started to find clues that only May could understand like old locker combinations, and hangouts that May and Libby shared. Is Libby alive?I really enjoyed this book, especially because of the mystery and how well I could picture everything in my head.

Like I should have expected anything else from Cherie Priest! I didn't know much about the story, and so I was very surprised by the twists and turns that it took. Really enjoyed it, couldn't put it down!But I can't bring myself to give it five stars because . . . There's a part at the end, where everything is so tense, and then four people who should totally know better do the most confusingly daft thing I've ever heard of. I mean, it makes no sense for about ten pages. I had to go back, reread the bit before, and confirm that yes, that was really what they were doing. Why? No idea. I mean, not to spoil anything, but they're looking for something, something they know the size and shape of, and it is large, and they have discussed the largeness and where it would potentially be kept, and then they proceed to look in places where it could not possibly be, wasting precious time. Like behind books on a bookcase, and in kitchen drawers, when they know they are looking for something the size of a small car. No, I'm serious. And I just . . . I couldn't get over that. It didn't ruin the book, but it was just temporarily not good, when the rest of the book was awesome.So, you know, read that bit (you have to, it's the lead up to the climax), but just read it quickly.

While walking on the streets of Seattle May sees a sticker for Princess X, but that couldn't be there because Princess X died along with Libby when she died, or is Libby still alive? I Am Princess X is a fun and cute book to read, the illustrations are wonderful and eye-catching. The story is mainly centered around May and Trick and their quest to find out who is the creator of the Princess X website. The book is fairly fast-paced and it shouldn't take you very long to read it (although it did for me).May and Trick (Patrick) are our two MCs. May used to be best friends with Libby until she died and they created Princess X together. To be honest May's character was a bit dull, she didn't really have any special qualities at all. Her main focus was on Libby and finding her. I would have loved for the author to give May a bit more background, because she wasn't that interesting. Patrick helps May throughout the novel with the tech-y part of finding out who's behind Princess X and whether or not Libby is still alive. Sort of like May, Patrick was dull. There wasn't a lot of personality to him, although I did like the banter between him and May.Like I said before the story is fairly fast-paced. While the author doesn't really do a good job at the characters she did an excellent job at the plot. At first I didn't really think this book would make for a good story, aside from the illustrations I didn't think it would be that good, but I really liked it. The author does a good job at making you wonder who's behind Princess X and whether or not Libby is still alive. I guess the big reveal towards the end of the book wasn't that big of a deal, but it was still fun to figure out who was behind Princess X (although I had a pretty good idea who it was *wink wink*). Although some parts of the story were a bit too convenient, such as how the comic for I Am Princess X aligned just right with what actually happened. I just have to say I really liked the graphic novel part of the story, they were incorporated quite nicely with the story. Overall this was a fun read and I would definitely recommend."}, {"userName": "Tanya (Girl Plus Books)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416997-tanya-girl-plus-books", "userReview": "I saw I Am Princess X mentioned on a book blog not too long ago and it caught my eye. Enough so that I nabbed it from the library. This is a YA (that often felt more like a MG) novel about May and her friend Libby. As children they created Princess X - Libby drew and May wrote. A few years after Libby's untimely death May starts to see Princess X stickers all around and begins to dig into the how's and why's. This was a fun blend of traditional story telling and a graphic novel/comic. When May discovers the Princess X web comic, fantasy and reality start to blend as she pieces together clues from the comic to solve the real life mystery of what really happened to Libby. However, the \"mystery\" of what happened to Libby isn't particularly mysterious since it's basically all spelled out right in the comic. And it didn't take a genius to decipher the clues. Add in the fact that May's new friend just happens to be a hacker extraordinaire (gee, how handy!) and all answers basically just fell in their laps. Middle grade readers will probably have fun with the comic aspect and the few \"action\" scenes but this is just too dumbed down for teens.

May wrote the stories, Libby drew the comics. Both girls lived vicariously through the Princess' adventures until the day Libby died. Supposedly. For years, May dreams of her friend misses the days they spent creating a world for themselves. Until the day she discovers a sticker that looks remarkably like their Princess X. This leads her on a search throughout the city for more proof and she quickly realizes that there are just too many parallels for the comic to be coincidence. With the help of her neighbor and hacker (with slightly criminal leanings) Trick, May begins to delve deeper into the world of Princess X and realizes that Libby's death may not have been as real as she had believed. She is still out there, and she has left clues so that Libby can find her and bring her home. I Am Princess X is a really unique blend of graphic novel and traditional storytelling. Sprinkled throughout the book are pieces of a graphic novel that features a princess trying to escape her captor and find several items of power in order to save her kingdom. The illustrations are beautiful and the story of Princess X melds with the mystery of the missing girl in a really interesting way. I do wish my review copy had included more of the illustrations, but I will definitely be picking up a finished copy when it is released. I enjoyed the characters but I do wish there had been more development and that they had been more consistent, for example Trick is given the backstory of having made some poor decisions, losing his scholarship and doing whatever he can in order to earn enough money to pay for school himself. However, once he meets May, he drops all of that in order to run around the city looking for clues to Libby's whereabouts. I was pretty happy with the complete lack of a romantic storyline. That is downright refreshing in a YA novel and I felt that May had a pretty realistic relationship with her parents. Unfortunately, I Am Princess X suffered from that same old issue when writers who are used to writing for an adult audience make the foray into young adult. They just don't seem to give young readers enough credit. This leads to a strange style of writing where they appear to \"dumb things down\", as if the writer thought she had to make it easier in order for a teen to \"get it\". This meant there was lots of repetition of things that we already knew (like the fact that she went to Libby's funeral or that she prefers hot chocolate to coffee), bland statements of facts and recaps of events, with little to no nuance to the mystery itself. It also made reference to tech and social media in a very \"look, I'm a cool adult, I know what twitter is\" kind of way. Ultimately, I am Princess X is a suspenseful story about a missing girl. And it does this very well. May searches for clues in the comics and then those translate into real life adventures to find the \"keys\" Libby has left behind. There is a real sense of danger as the bad guy is your Criminal Minds type kidnapper with an intelligent manner of planning and some serious tech savvy skills that keep the kids running. It is a great read for those interested in a quick mystery and it will really appeal to fans of graphic novels who want to explore how the genre can work within a traditional story.

What started with Libby's drawing of a badass princess in red Chucks, and budding writer May's insistence that she needed no magic wand, only a sword, became volumes and volumes of the life of Princess X.\nLibby and May did not leave Princess X on the sidewalk. They took her home and, together, they built an imaginary empire.\nOnce upon a few years later,The life of Princess X was tragically cut short when, at the age of thirteen, Libby was killed when her mother drove their car off a bridge, having fallen asleep at the wheel..... Supposedly.All May knows about the case, at the time, is that her friend is dead, and her father had their house professionally cleaned out as he left the shattered remains of his life in Seattle behind him.And those cleaners took a closet shelf full of Princess X with them.\nLibby was dead. Princess X disappeared.May lost her friend, again and again and again.\nOnce upon a now,May's been jumping back and forth between Atlanta and Seattle ever since her parents split up, shortly after Libby's death.One day, wanting out of the apartment while her father works, May takes a walk downtown as she ponders the novel she'd like to write.But May instead finds Princess X.Kind of. What May finds is a sticker that definitely has Princess X on it.Her dad says it's a coincidence. After all, her and Libby's boxes of Princess X writings and pictures were picked up by a thrift shop service. Maybe someone found them and decided to take Princess X on themselves.May could almost be convinced, until a little snooping leads her to IAmPrincessX.com, the website that hosts the Princess X webcomic.Sure that this is her Princess X, solidified by the fact nobody knows who draws and writes it, May launches into Sherlock mode.Details May never knew about Libby and her mother's death come to light, and she knows her friend is still alive.Libby is Princess X.With the help of the in-need-of-work teenage computer hacker expert upstairs, who finds even more about the case than May could, and the clues she picks up from the comic, (clues only she could find) she sets off to find her friend and bring whoever killed Libby's mother and possibly held her captive to justice.The expert, Trick, has landed in some serious Dutch himself, losing a scholarship to Washington U for hacking into his high school's computer system to knock the girl who dumped him's grades down a few pegs. He agreed to help May for the money (all six bucks and fifty cents she could offer).He stayed for the mystery.But when the chase turns deadly, May and Trick become tangled up in a bigger game than they could've possibly imagined.And this is no comic book trial.\nThis wasn't just an adventure, it was life or death. And what could you say about life and death?\nOh. My. GOD.I fell hard and fast for this book, folks.May's character was so real to me. As a nerdy kid and not *exactly* cool 'young-adult', I could relate to her immediately.The mystery doesn't kick in completely until the last quarter of the book, but that wasn't the point.The point was about friendship and about how something you love can never be gone if you always keep it close to your heart.The mystery itself wasn't hardboiled the say the least. I knew where most of it was going, but I was totally cool with that. Wanna know why?There was enough going on (not a lick of it romantic, might I add) that the mystery wasn't all that important to me. May's adventures with Trick, the hunt for Princess X's Easter Eggs in the real world, were like the best urbex scavenger hunt ever.And, again, there were two teenagers who didn't fall in doe-eyed instalove two seconds after meeting. They-GASP!Become friends!Un-freaking-heard of, right?Two insignificant sidenotes are that May and her dad watched The Venture Bros. and for the first time in a while, I ran into a character who says 'supper' instead of 'dinner', like I do.Just really helped me relate more. Cherie Priest has written several books for adults, and this is her first one aimed at teens. I can tell she's still getting her feet under her in YA, but this was a solid first book in the genre.Part of me wants more, but the other part is glad the characters' stories were all resolved, within reason, and the author is done with this set.I'm honestly just really glad to see geek girls of the non-manic pixie variety and a positive male-female friendship that didn't have to be romantic, especially in YA.The art by Kali Cliesmier was great. I read a lot of webcomics (I mean a lot ) and it definitely felt authentic.I'm only gonna share the one because there isn't a ton of it in the book.

May wrote in the comic and Libby was the illustrator. One day May was told that Libby's mom accidentally drove their car off of the bridge and Libby and her mom died. A few years later May started seeing Princess X showing up everywhere, so she got on her computer and found a web comic all about Pricess X, but they were all stories May had never heard before. So who was putting them there? Nobody knew about Princess X besides Libby and May. May continued reading the web comic and the further she got into it the more she was sure, that her best friend was still alive, but May was still so scared about her best friend because the we comic said that May was in a lot of trouble because a very dangerous man called, \"The Needle Man\" was after her and everyone who came looking for her. May teamed up with a boy named Patrick, and together they found more clues that all pointed to the fact that Libby was still alive. I Am Princess X had me on the edge of my seat every single time I picked it up to read. It made me feel so scared about what could happen to Libby or May if The Needle Man found them. This book kind of reminds me of  A Wrinkle in Time because in both of the books the characters are trying to save someone really close to them, and they both seem to be adventure books to me.  I Am Princess X  is one of my favorite books I have ever read. I recommend this book to people who like adventure books that keep you on the edge of your seat that have a little bit of realistic fiction in them too."}, {"userName": "Tanja Voosen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5464546-tanja-voosen", "userReview": "Zu diesem Buch habe ich sehr spontan gegriffen, weil es auch vor kurzem auf Deutsch erschienen ist. Ich hatte keinerlei Erwartungen an die Story und wusste auch nicht recht, was mich erwartet. Das Buch beinhaltet nicht nur Text, sondern auch ausgesprochen genial gemachte Graphic Novel Elemente, da im Zentrum des Buchs ein Web-Comic mit den Namen \"Princess X\" steht. In diesem Comic sind Hinweise versteckt, die unsere Protagonistin May nutzt, um ihre tot geglaubte beste Freundin zu finden. Es gab keine Liebesgeschichte, was f\u00fcr mich ein gro\u00dfer Pluspunkt war, denn der Fokus lag ganz auf der Freundschaft zweier M\u00e4dchen, die durch einen tragischen Vorfall auseinander gerissen worden. Ich finde auch, man ahnt das ganze Buch \u00fcber gar nicht wirklich, ob Libby nun doch noch am Leben ist oder eben nicht! Man bangt, hofft und folgt den Hinweisen...Die wilde Hinweis-Suche durch ganz Seattle gefiel mit unheimlich gut! Das Buch ist kurz, bringt vieles gezielt auf den Punkt, bleibt aber dabei wirklich spannend. Ich habe die Story fast an einem St\u00fcck gelesen und konnte kaum noch aufh\u00f6ren. Es war eben auch einfach mal etwas anderes! Der Mystery-Faktor ist zwar nicht riesig, aber die Geheimnisse, die zutage kommen waren nicht gerade leichte Kost und doch sehr tiefgr\u00fcndig. Auch die Figuren waren allesamt sympathisch und man konnte ihnen voll und ganz folgen. Und wirklich, die wundervollen Comic-Sequenzen waren einfach so mega cool!!!Ein schnelllebiges, originelles Abenteuer durch Wort und Bild :D"}, {"userName": "Ingram", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58910009-ingram", "userReview": "Thanks to Evan for the recommendation! Although I don't usually like mystery books, I could not put this one down. The story starts with two outcasts - Libby and May - who can't play at recess so they start drawing with chalk on the sidewalk at school. They become fast friends and together create this story of Princess X. A few years later, Libby dies in a car crash with her mom. May is devastated because she's lost her only friend and all of their Princess X stories. When May is a teenager, she starts seeing Princess X stickers all over town. With the help of a tech-saavy neighbor, May starts investigating the stickers, a mysterious online comic that looks very familiar, and clues left by a mysterious guy with bleached blonde hair. The adventure that follows is exciting, scary, and will keep you guessing until the very end! The twists and turns made me anxious to keep reading, but in a good way! It was an ending I did not expect! I love that the main character is a strong, independent female who never gives up on her friends. This would be a great book to read as a book club with your friends! May reminds me of Katniss from The Hunger Games - she is on an adventure the entire book and never gives up on her friends. If you like adventures and mystery, you will love this book!"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4063913-beth", "userReview": "This is a strange book. I'd go so far as to say it's MG, not YA, despite having teenage protagonists, because this is a novel in the vein of a lot of MG: young intrepid protagonists solving wacky mystery on their own. And it is a wacky mystery, and the motivations of the evil character are murky, and I am Princess X ultimately feels like a showpiece for child detecting in the internet age. Lots of tech references are dropped - this is a book that'll date pretty quickly, I think - and the mystery ends up being completely preposterous. I didn't believe the story: not the main character's loneliness, or her complete lack of friends given the way she interacted with Patrick, or Patrick's involvement, or Jack's, or the ease with which the webcomic becomes famous and May conveniently solves it all."}, {"userName": "Divya", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59237027-divya", "userReview": "I love this book so much!"}, {"userName": "Krista Regester", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53724042-krista-regester", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book for it's uniqueness and compelling characters. Unfortunately the story just didn't seem realistic to me, and it wasn't quite fantasy either. Since I listened to it I didn't get to experience the illustrated parts, and the way these sections were portrayed were pretty rough. There was a lot of funky music, weird voices, and stretched out sequences I could have done without. Overall, I loved that it was a kick ass female lead book that a middle school audience would definitely appreciate."}, {"userName": "Alison Strandell", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33550827-alison-strandell", "userReview": "I love it!!! The book has regular novel with some graphic novel mixed in, and it would be an interesting read for both guys or girls. There is non-stop action and mystery, almost like a Jason Bourne or Taken or Ocean's Eleven movie, but for younger people. I love how relevant tech is included, like the Dark net and hackers. The setting of Seattle with all the coffee drinking and underground parts of the city is cool. I only would have wanted more explanation about the killer's motives. Must be because I really like crime shows with the specific details. A super enjoyable read!!"}], "description": "Best friends, big fans, a mysterious webcomic, and a long-lost girl collide in this riveting novel, perfect for fans of both Cory Doctorow and Sarah Dessen; illustrated throughout with comics.Once upon a time, two best friends created a princess together. Libby drew the pictures, May wrote the tales, and their heroine, Princess X, slayed all the dragons and scaled all the mountains their imaginations could conjure. Once upon a few years later, Libby was in the car with her mom, driving across the Ballard Bridge on a rainy night. When the car went over the side, Libby passed away, and Princess X died with her. Once upon a now: May is sixteen and lonely, wandering the streets of Seattle, when she sees a sticker slapped in a corner window. Princess X? When May looks around, she sees the Princess everywhere: Stickers. Patches. Graffiti. There's an entire underground culture, focused around a webcomic at IAmPrincessX.com. The more May explores the webcomic, the more she sees disturbing similarities between Libby's story and Princess X online.
