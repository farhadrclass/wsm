It is the first one I read by this author and now I am wondering why I never read her books before? After all, I was raised on Sci-Fi and Fantasy, this should have been in my radar long time ago! However, I think my reluctance of reading books in an unfinished series might have something to do with it. So, I end up being the last one at the party most of the time, but I say \"Better late than Never!!\"!!! This book was published first in 1987 and I can recognize many of the style markers for that time, markers which I miss dearly nowadays... One in particular is the technical side of the Sci-Fi, still heavily relying on the science, rather then fantasy. Being raised by two ENGINEERS, and the way my mind seems to like to structure itself, I love the writing in which we take in consideration all physical laws as we know them and build on them, or despite of them, instead of just coming up with impossibilities which defy logic on all levels, and justified by saying \"Well, it is Fantasy, everything goes!\". Those writers tend to forget that all of us, no matter how ignorant of science itself, live in a physical world in which, no matter how much we might not like it, every action DOES have a reaction!!! Or as the Fantasy writers like to say, there is a PRICE for all magic! \n\"... \"Don't be afraid of trouble, Silver. They're a sign of life. We'll deal with them together - tomorrow\".\u201d ...\"\nMs. BUJOLD has created a world based on scientific possibilities and has brought it and all of its inhabitants to life in a somewhat linear and minimalistic, but very powerful and enjoyable way. There are about 4-5 POV's, but the main characters is Leo, the teaching engineer, who has been brought on board of this space habitat in order to teach the very unexpected young and naive students, the Quaddies, a genetically created new species of humans, designed to function best and mostly exclusively at 0 Gravity environments. This experiment has been funded by a mega for profit corporation and is treating them as a biological tool, with no rights, no desires, feelings, or anything remotely acknowledging them as human. Thus they reserve the right to use them and discard them as they see fit, especially since the whole 25-26 year old experiment has been conducted clandestinely. In the moment I met the first Quaddie, Tony, I was in love!!! They have been raised in with a myriad of wrong ideas, but with some true caring and idealism as well. Many things they are made to do, which I found despicable and abhorrent, they did with no issues because they had not been thought they were not right... Their distance from violence and intrigues is also what makes them so lovable, loving and I was disarmed by their innocence. Contrasted to the cold-hearted calculation and pure cynicism of the company management, I wanted to cry, not only for them, but for humanity and the path we seem to be on even now, regular and \"insignificant\" humans and environment be damned!!! \n\"... \u201cWere you BORN inhuman or did you grow so by degrees?! MS, MD, PHD?\u201d ...\"\nClaire and her baby were adorable, but Silver stole the show! This rebellious, but still good hearted young woman braved all the unknown challenges, as terrifying for her as they were, in order to bring on a change for her people and find herself in the process. And the nursery supervisor was the heart of all the humans in the book. Compelling indeed!\n\"... \u201cIt's an ancient and honorable term for the final step in any engineering project. Turn it on, see if it smokes.\u201d...\"\nOverall, I loved the book and found it perfectly balanced, despite reading over and over in some of the reviews that there was not enough action... The massage was hefty enough to compensate for all the little weaknesses. For a Sci-Fi, it is a very pleasant read!!!I wish you all happy Reading and may you always find what you seek in the pages of a good book!!"}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "Update 10/3/17 Re-readI think I just relaxed into this read, knowing damn well that it was going to be a novel of revolution against corporate idiots and assholes. Understanding that this came out in '88 goes a long way to grooving to the sense of hate and loathing we all felt during that time period. Or is that just me? Maybe it's just me.Fortunately, I love the Children's Crusade and the RAH feel, from the Can-Do engineering and idealistic gruffness to the all-out freedom brigade. :)If I had to compare this to most SF in general, I'd still have to give it top marks. But as a piece of the Vorkosigan universe? It's in it and a few pieces carry over. That's about it. :) It's fine. lolOriginal review:Unfortunately for me, I've already read a number of the Miles books, so when I got around to reading this, I just wanted Miles. I was doing an injustice to the novel, although I didn't realize it at the time. So, I'm going back and reading all of the novels in chronological order to get a better and more mature grip on the series that I remember so fondly.Firstly, I like Graf. Secondly, I like the quaddies. I saw that the quaddies were mushrooms and ripe for the picking, and half-expected a Moon is a Harsh Mistress treatment. It didn't happen, just a mere run-away novel, but I did enjoy the ultimate set-up. As a novel on its own, I think it might have deserved more agency and action, but in the wider scheme of things, I was perfectly happy. I am a fan-boy, after all.The characters weren't quite as delightful as some by the same author, but they weren't a slouch by any standard. It's hard to turn engineers into full-blown heroes, but it was fun to see.Oh, wait... I do recall reading all of Heinlein... :) Maybe it's not so hard. Still fun, after all these years.On a positive note, I think she's better than Heinlein in world-building and tight-gripped control of technology and consequence. Some of her characters are a lot better than his, too. I think this is very high praise, by the way. I grew up on Heinlein and enjoyed every single page."}, {"userName": "Evgeny", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9340136-evgeny", "userReview": "An Engineer dies and goes to hell.

We like this guy.\"God demands, \"If you don't send him to me immediately, I'll sue!\"The Devil laughs. \"Where are YOU going to get a lawyer?\"\nA buddy read with Choko.For those unfamiliar with Lois McMaster Bujold I will give a quick introduction. One of the reviewers said that she is to Hugo awards what Meryl Streep is to Oscars. I am talking about the time when Hugo awards were about the quality and not politics. In my opinion when it comes to women science fiction writers absolutely nobody write space opera better. She is also the best counterargument to the idea that there are no women science fiction writers (or quality women science fiction writers). Last but not least she is a very nice person (which should not actually matter, but I consider it as an additional bonus). This series is the main reason Ms. Bujold is one of the most respected modern science fiction writers. Here comes the biggest problem with the series I had. There are at least 3 possible ordering of it: publication, chronological, and author recommended. My usual rule is, if in doubt go with chronological. In here we decided not to go against the biggest expect on this, so I we went with author recommended. Recommended or chronological, this is the first book to read.This is a prequel which happens way before the main character of the series, Miles Vorkosigan was born. Actually it happened way before his parents were born. Leo Graff was a good engineer and even better teacher of his profession. His next assignment happened to be a Clay Habitat in a far corner of known space. This is where he met Quaddies; I was shocked by them and there is no way I am going to spoil it. Let me just say that if there ever was a time to stand up for little (literally speaking) people, this was it. Leo ended up being the only one who was in the right time and place to do it - and he decided he cannot let the matters be. A good engineer can successfully solve any problem using engineering methods and Leo was a very good one - remember Scotty?The first thing I want to say is about engineers. Scotty notwithstanding this is a very underrated profession. Salespeople sell, managers manage, lawyers make even more complicated laws, and do not let me start on politicians. At this same time engineers actually build stuff: something necessary and useful for all. They are the guys building bridges on Federal freeways. They are the guys making sure the bridges will stand under heavy non-stop traffic providing the upkeep people will not use salt on the pavement during winter time. They are the guys keeping the bridge standing even after the said salt has eaten through and began its work on the metal base - after all nobody is going to pay for the new bridge. This example by the way is taken from the real life and my fellow Montrealers/Montr\u00e9alais know the bridge in question. This is one of the few books showing the hard and so much needed work of engineers. Even if Leo Graff as a character would be completely eclipsed by Miles Vorkosigan in the following books, he and his work are fascinating.  \"On the sixth day God saw He couldn't do it all, so He created ENGINEERS.\"Setting that profession aside the book touched on quite a few important subjects - did I mention it won a Nebular Award for best novel (among others)? It is also never boring. My only regret is that I have not read the whole series before. This is a recommended book and series from one of the modern science fiction masters. My special thanks go to Choko for mercilessly dragging gently guiding me into the buddy read of the series."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish", "userReview": "No fate but what we make.That could be the motto for this story and I loved the concept. This is a quite old scifi book, belonging to a quite long series. But it didn't show in the way I first thought. The story is about an engineer arriving on a space station in order to teach some employees of the company he works for as well. When he arrives, however, he discovers that the students are children and genetically altered ones at that. The worst, though, is how they are being treated by the \"normal\" humans as they have no human rights. They are things to be worked and bred. And all too soon this is exactly what endagers them all.Hence, this book is about basic human rights, gender equality (consider the age of the story, then you can stand next to me clapping at the author), technology vs. humanity (in a way) and what makes us individuals and human.I liked how fun and fast-paced this was. The world Bujold built here came to life effortlessly and though a lot of ideas where incorporated, each topic was addressed with enough details and they fit together seemlessly too. The characters were lively and quirky in their ways (though some stood out a bit more than others, naturally) and many story elements were quite chuckle-worthy, at least for people with enough Schadenfreude (like myself). Most of all, I liked how the author played tricks on the reader (myself included). I was actually shocked and confused about the supposed sexism I encountered in the first third of the book, but Bujold wonderfully turned those concepts upside down (making them fit perfectly with the setting), creating powerful reversals that became equally powerful statements.I know that we won't get to see the people from this story again as the rest of the series will play several hundred years in the future, which actually makes me sad. But at least we'll get to see some Quaddies in other installments so in a way the author lets us see what became of them as a society."}, {"userName": "mark monday", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131922-mark-monday", "userReview": "engineer encounters hideous situation involving exploitation of a unique group of workers. engineer fights against this hideous situation.so this is really a 2 star book, whatever, I'm giving it 3 stars because yeah I liked it, and more importantly I would never give 2 stars to a friend and at this point I kinda feel like Lois McMaster Bujold is my friend. I've been working my way back and forth through her Vorkosigan Saga and I think that not only do I believe in everything she believes in - the points she wants to make and the anger she feels at some things and her perspective on gender & race & sexual identity, all that - but I think that she has been working out those points as a sort of conversation with this series' readers about progressive values and fighting against authority, about how different people stand up in different ways but those different ways may amount to the same kind of courage, a conversation about how Bujold herself feels about these sorts of things and how her own viewpoint has progressed (well, perhaps progressed... maybe she has just become increasingly sophisticated in how she expresses her viewpoint and values). so what if the situation presented is a bit maudlin, the villain obnoxiously rote and two-dimensional, too much mechanical-technical-engineering mumbo jumbo, the ending rather on the wish fulfillment side of things, some unnecessary infantilizing of the labor force in question, etc... well what of it. the novel was for the most part fun, exciting, moving, and thoughtful. that's how I like my space operas. the central character is great and just as appealing is the major supporting character Silver, whose characterization is surprisingly dynamic. Bujold moves her past her race's adorable but limited childlike attributes; she eventually displays cunning, insight, leadership, a sensitive sort of ruthlessness, and in the end transcends what could have been a clich\u00e9d type - the ambitious young lady who uses sex to get ahead. and the ending... well, sometimes I like wish fulfillment, so sue me. Bujold would later improve her technique - but the awesome person she clearly is, well, that's already present in this early work. sister, I really dig you."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31814285-daniel", "userReview": "Prvo imamo Dreamweaver's Dilemma interesantnu pri\u010dicu o opsnostima nove tehnologije prikazane kroz blago detektivsku pri\u010du.

I've been delighted to give 3 of those 5 stars- Happy to give 6 of them a very solid 4 stars - Only Shards of Honour has gotten a 3 stars from me (before now)- Despite being a Nebula award winner, I'd say this is the weakest Bujold I've read.That's not to say \nFalling Free\n is bad - 3 stars is defined as \"liked it\" and I certainly did that (I read most of it in one sitting in the tub), it's just that I know Bujold can do better than this.So... about the book.\nFalling Free\n is set in the same universe as the stories about Miles Vorkosigan, but waaaay earlier in the timeline, and nothing to do with the planet of Barrayar - so none of the familiarity of shared characters or locations from the main series (which reminded me of Small Gods within Pratchett's Discworld series). The hero is a level-headed engineer (which reminded me of Clarke's Fountains of Paradise, which I read a few months ago) called Graf. Graf is assigned to teach space welding on a secret-project space-habitat. When he gets there, Graf discovers the habitat is populated by a genetically engineered 'new breed' of humans calls Quaddies, with extra arms instead of legs - adapted for permanent life in zero-gee. This is a great, visual concept. Win. FROM HERE BE SPOILERS!When news of a scientific breakthrough (artificial gravity) hits the secret-project, the decision is made (by evil senior company execs) to kill the project, sterilise the Quaddies and imprison them on a planet. Graf decides to throw in his lot with the Quaddies and rescue them. Cue space habitat rebellion (which reminded me of parts of Vinge's Deepness in the Sky). So what's the problem?What usually makes Bujold's sci-fi sing is her superb characters. Loveable, unpredictable, proactive, dynamic and exciting - but flawed, error-prone, egotistical, etc. If you've never read Bujold and you're just checking out this title, you're in for a treat because she's ace, this just isn't her best. In this book (I can't believe I'm saying this...) all her characters felt flat.Graf is too 'perfect'.Van Atta is too 'bad'.Claire and Tony are too 'nice'. Silver is the only characters with a bit of complexity/ambiguity, but everything she does is driven by someone else (sleeping with Van Atta because he wants it, helping Claire and Tony escape because they want to, leading the rebellion because Graf suggests it, etc).The adventure skips along at a good pace, and I was never tempted to put it down, but once the character 'types' had been set-up, I spent the rest of the book waiting for someone (anyone!) to break from their type... to do something unexpected. All the big moments are foreshadowed in multiple ways - this is structured, engineered storytelling - but it makes the whole shebang feel like it's running on rails - there was no suspense regarding if things would work out OK, but plenty of curiosity as to how the obstacles would be overcome.\nFalling Free\n is a good addition to the Vorkosiverse - but it's like a bread roll in the middle of a great meal - nothing wrong with a tasty bread roll, but in context it's a palette cleanser to set you up for the more complex tastes to follow. More Miles please..!After this I read: Diplomatic Immunity"}, {"userName": "Apatt", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt", "userReview": "Falling Free is one of several Hugo winners for Lois McMaster Bujold, she is practically sci-fi\u2019s counterpart to Meryl Streep in term of awards. This book is set in her popular Vorkosigan universe but does not have any Vorkosigan in it, not even a mention. In the time setting of this book Miles Vorkosigan will not be born for another 200 years. However, this does not mean this book is like a cup of coffee without any coffee in it, it is well worth anybody\u2019s time.Basically this is a story of a race of bioengineered humans called the \u201cQuadies\u201d. They have four arms but no legs, the lower pair of arms are placed where the legs normally are. This configuration is designed for living and operating naturally in freefall. They live in a space habitat where they carry out engineering and other work for no payment. Their needs are provided by GalacTech, the company that fund their creation and own them. As such the Quadies are basically lower than second class citizens, they are perhaps only a few steps above beasts of burden. They lack the most basic human rights, as these do not extend to transhuman rights.As you can imagine the central theme of this book is about the right to live a good life, free from tyranny. A right which we would have to extend to any sentient beings we create, be they transhumans or artificial intelligences. Thematically it reminds me a little of Heinlein\u2019s The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. However, Falling Free is not some heavy-handed propaganda, Ms. Bujold never loses sight of her role as a storyteller. The story of the Quadies\u2019 struggle for independence and freedom is told in Bujold\u2019s dependable breezy and graceful narrative style. The ethical aspect of the story is for the readers to infer at their leisure or completely ignore if they just want to kick back and soak in a few hours of escapism.As always Bujold is able to create a cast of relatable characters, the hero Leo Graf (human with legs) is suitably resourceful, honorable, slightly insecure and humble. The main Quaddies characters are very likable and tend to have a childlike earnestness to them. The villain of the piece, Mr. Van Atta, the general manager of the space habitat project, is not one of fiction\u2019s most formidable antagonists. He lacks the competency, his villainy is more of a \u201cboo-hiss\u201d variety. This is not a densely plotted novel, but it does move along at a fair clip.The Vorkosigan series is often classified as \u201cmilitary science fiction\u201d but Falling Free does not have any military in it, just a few ineffective security guards. This is closer to being a \u201chard SF\u201d novel than a military one. In fact the science or the \u201cSFnal\u201d aspect of the book may be its best features. The advantages of having four arms and no legs is vividly depicted, as is the Quaddies\u2019s first experience of a planet with gravity, how mobility suddenly becomes much more of an issue. I can just about imagine being a Quaddie. The outcome of the book is fairly predictable but given the plot trajectory I do not see that Bujold had any choice. If you are new to the Vorkosigan series Falling Free is not a bad start, it works 100% as a standalone book, though I believe there are some better books in the series.About 4.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Lightreads", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads", "userReview": "A few hundred years before the events of the Vorkosigan books, a galactic corporation genetically engineered the Quaddies, people perfectly suited to zero gravity engineering and construction work because of their extra pair of arms instead of legs. A human engineer comes aboard the project, and through a series of events which do not need exploring at this juncture he finds himself spearheading nothing less than a revolution in a desperate bid to get the Quaddies safely out of corporate control when they\u2019re slated for termination.Huh. So about 75 pages into this book I went \u201cum what?\u201d and ran off to check the publication date. Because I knew it was early Bujold, but I didn\u2019t realize how early. I mean, it\u2019s classic Bujold SF \u2013 powered by character concerns as much as technology \u2013 but it\u2019s, you know . . . early. I was tipped off by the wobbly POV, the slightly hasty character development, the wild coincidences \u2013 the entire plot hinges on a typo at one point, for God\u2019s sake! There\u2019s also the slightly troubling shape of the thing, the way the revolution is powered by a human with his big human ideas, and the Quaddies are just a bunch of kids following along.Still, it is Bujold, and there are flashes of what will later be her more concentrated moments of clarity and brilliance:\u201cI\u2019m no worse than anyone else.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m giving you the chance to be better, don\u2019t you see . . .\u201dThe moral compass of the book points a bit too uncomplicatedly for my taste, but the heart of the thing is true. It\u2019s about choices and self-determination, about how being a bystander makes you complicit in horror because choosing to do nothing is a choice too. The theme and narrative line of direction waver a bit \u2013 sometimes blaring in your ear, sometimes too tenuous \u2013 but they sound a clear note for all that.Ah well.

Cherryh\u2019s book Downbelow Station. In both books a huge intergalactic company is using and abusing a population of people who are considered somehow \u201cless than\u201d humans. In DbS, it was an alien race, the Hisa (also known as Downers in human slang). Here in Falling Free it is the quaddies, the result of human genome manipulation, who have four arms instead of two arms & two legs, supposedly to be make them more suited to zero gravity.There are strong hints of the Frankenstein story, with people often being physically ill when first meeting a quaddie. There is also a security agent on the nearest planet who reacts poorly to them, having envisioned monsters rather than people. So-called normal people react very negatively towards quaddies, just as people reacted with fear & hostility to Frankenstein\u2019s creature.I also couldn\u2019t help but think of Octavia Butler\u2019s work, dealing as it does with issues of slavery and power differentials. Butler\u2019s works are much more powerful, but this novel does deal with some of the same themes. The quaddies are considered property, rather than employees, and the breeding program that the company had devised for them reminded me strongly of a slave owner using a stock breeding scheme for his slaves rather than acknowledging their personal relationships and preferences. Add to that the sexual exploitation of at least one of the female quaddies, and that parallel becomes undeniable.This book takes place in the Vorkosigan universe, but does not mention the family at all (for those of you who are most interested in Cordelia and Miles). Once again, like with Ethan of Athos, I am left wishing that Bujold had continued on with this story line, instead of this volume being a one-off.

I have read many of them previously, but out of order. This is my first exposure to Falling Free and despite some minor issues, I think it's held up pretty well.Leo Graf is a testing engineer whose latest posting at the Cay Habitat leads to some surprises. The people he's come to teach zero-G engineering practicalities to are an engineered variety of human: free-fall adapted \"quaddies\" with a second set of arms instead of legs. But the catch is that they've also been engineered as slave labor for the corporation that created them.While I've not read this before, I have read Diplomatic Immunity where we get the future of the quaddies in Miles's time. I don't remember a great deal about it, but now I'm looking forward to picking up some of the nuances relating to their origin that I probably missed the first time around.This is a very simple story, that of slaves fleeing from a horrible master and making their own destiny. The good and bad are very well-separated with the bad guy being both evil and incompetent, so the outcome is never in doubt as the situation is just too stark. Where a lot of the tension comes in is whether Graf and the quaddies can escape without paying a terrible cost in lives and people left behind.Solid, but there are far better and more nuanced commentary on slave peoples available in modern speculative fiction, notably The Fifth Season and the rest of that trilogy."}, {"userName": "Veronique", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12371602-veronique", "userReview": "\"If you ever have to make a choice between learning and inspiration, boy, choose learning.

Yes, it has an old fashioned aspect (it was written in the late 1980s), perhaps due to the cringing mysoginy and racism. Stereotypes abound too, with the big 'baddie', who became more farcical as the story progressed, employed by a soulless corporation, interested only in financial gain. Do hold on however.

Leo is the nice guy, Mr. Fix-it, and apparently based on Bujold's father, who was an engineer and wrote a definitive book on non-destructive testing.The bad guy is a proper slimebag, the quaddies are all nice, naive kids. Bujold's imagery is very vivid. The story is well plotted and paced, if a little predictable. Every now and then she geeks out and over-indulges in engineering babble.The ending feels a bit as if there could have been more, and I read somewhere that Bujold had indeed planned to write another book to tell the rest of the story.Chronologically Falling Free is the first book in the Vorkosigan Saga. It is more of a prequel though, as it is set 200 years before the main series, without the central character of the series. I plan to buddy read the whole series with some friends, in the mentioned chronological order, not in order of publication.

Residing in the space habitat are a thousand young and very young quaddies, genetically engineered with no legs but four arms and hands to be especially well adapted for working in a gravitation-free environment. Everything at first seems fine, except that the director is inhumane. He looks at the quaddies as if they are mutants, they are property of his corporation. They can be manipulated and worked in any way he feels is desirable.This is an exciting story, with some interesting novel concepts about genetic engineering, spelling out the differences for the quaddies between a gravitation-free environment and living on a regular planet. The story is filled with engineering details, reminding me a bit of The Martian, which also is jam-packed with engineering. Only here, the engineering details are not a major theme of the story--they serve more as a backdrop.I have two issues with this book. First, since I have read many other books by Lois McMaster Bujold, I know what type of ending is in store, ahead of time. My second issue, is that the program's director is too evil. People generally are not so black-and-white. If Leo Graf were not so perfect, and the director had not been portrayed as 100% evil, then the story could have been more interesting.I did not read this book; I listened to the audiobook, narrated like all the other Bujold books by Grover Gardner . He does a very good job reading the story, and I never had any trouble following who was speaking during the dialogs.

I don't know anything about Vorkosigan saga nor about this author save the fact that she got a Nebula award for this novel, which I happen to think she deserved. I\u2019m not sure will I explore this saga or not. I mean, taken the fact how much I was impressed by this novel, sure I would love to but with so many books on my reading list, who knows? In any case, this review will focus solely on this novel and explore it as such. My focus with this review is the novel itself and what I believe are its literary merits. Let's get to reviewing part, shall we? Saying that I really liked this novel is kind of an understatement but the reason why I\u2019m giving it four and not five stars is that I like to keep five stars for those novels that really changed my life. This one didn\u2019t feel life-changing to me nor did I have a sensation of having my mind completely blown away\u2026. what it felt like was a great novel. \u2026really brilliant piece of writing! I really do feel like singing praises to this novel because I really think that it is great, its characters are incredibly well developed and the plot is bullet proof. As a story, it is a page turner! I enjoyed reading it so much. As a SF novel, it is everything I love about this genre. The very reason why I love SF so much is that it often explores the most complex questions of our existence, the philological and moral dilemmas that lie deep in our soul. This novel has really gone into depth, into what makes us human, what makes us moral or immoral. In addition, I liked how it showcased that making a moral decision can be incredibly difficult and seriously challenging. That all being said, it still managed to be such an exciting story. It is action packed and keeps you on your toes, all that while managing to contain a real message and feeling of profoundness? Did I manage that the characters feel so alive that it impossible not to love them and feel deeply for them? If that doesn\u2019t make it a fantastic read, what is a fantastic read? If this isn\u2019t a great novel, what is a great novel?  I would even go so far as to say that I can\u2019t imagine an average SF fan not liking this novel. As soon as I started reading it, I had that warm feeling inside that good science fiction always grants me. Sure, we all have different tastes and I\u2019m sure that there are people who won\u2019t fall madly in love with this one, but it just seemed to me that it is a novel worth liking. Not that you should like it, I mean we live in a free world or at least that is where we should be living. I just have this idea in my head of it being likeable because I don\u2019t see it as having any weak points. The story is great, the writing is very good and it flows naturally with the story. Yes, the writing isn\u2019t exactly poetic but for this kind of story it need not be. It is logical, well organized and it works with the story not against it.  Where does the main literary merit of this novel lie? I\u2019m kind of divided on that one. I would say it has two main strongpoints: its focus on ethics (it presents very credible ethical dilemma and explores it wonderfully) and its characterisation (the protagonist is masterfully portrayed and the author even managed to make a whole new species look credible- no easy task at any rate).My final thoughts?This is an amazing SF novel, among the best that this genre has to offer. I immensely enjoyed reading it. I can\u2019t find any flaws with it whatsoever and I consider it to be an exceptional piece of writing. That all being said, I didn\u2019t feel that special connection with it, that feeling of having my soul stripped bare but that sensation only happened a few times in my life, so that doesn\u2019t make this novel a lesser one. It is not one of those novels that changed my life, but it felt like a great piece of writing nevertheless. I\u2019m as certain as I can possibly be that this novel deserves to be praised."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10743961-rob", "userReview": "Executive Summary: Much like Ethan of Athos this one had a very strange premise. I thought it was alright, but I'm hoping the series focuses on Miles again soon.Audiobook: Grover Gardner does another good job. When you're not sure about a book, having a good narrator can be a big help.\nFull Review\nI had issues with this book. It wasn't the idea of Quaddies themselves, but the idea of genetically engineering what are essentially slaves. Leo was a pretty good character, but the book felt like a sort of White Savior story at times. Leo wasn't as bad about this as some of the others. He seemed more about helping them help themselves than being their savior.The quaddies themselves weren't so much there to be saved as they were people born into a bad situation that wasn't of their own making. I don't remember the names of any of the other characters at this point, but the main antagonist was an awful human being who treated the quaddies like property instead of people.I read this book a few months ago now, so some of the details aren't as clear, but I remember one of the main female quaddies was my favorite.I struggled with this book at times, but there are some interesting ideas explored here. I'd probably have preferred something a bit more light and fun. I'll continue the series as it looks like the next one finally returns to Miles.

Taking place almost entirely on a spacestation and with a very peculiar crew, it's both traditional and, with her own twists, somewhat innovative, making this a wonderful introduction to this long and very popular series.This prequel to the Vorkosigan saga takes place a couple of hundred years prior to Miles' birth, and introduces us to a very interesting people called \"quaddies\", and a loveable and loving man named Leo Graf. Considered simply \u201ca genetic experiment\u201d, the thousand quaddies in their spacestation in orbit around a distant planet are scheduled to be killed off as they\u2019ve become non-profitable for the company that bred them. These intelligent children (the oldest is almost twenty) have been carefully socialized to conform and \u201cbehave\u201d, and they need to start breaking rules and thinking for themselves before it\u2019s too late. Wonderful beginning to this much-lauded series - I very much enjoyed my introduction to the Vorkosigan saga.

She also writes about the workplace and politics so, so well.Here, for example, is a gem:\"And those who can't teach, Leo finished silently, go into administration.\" This book is largely about a race of genetically modified children who can exist well in zero gravity environments. Bujold attacks the kinds of thinking in individuals and corporations/beaurocracies that can cause the justification of the elimination of 'inefficiencies' even in the case of sentient beings.Leo Graf finds himself fighting for the rights of the Quaddies and I felt swept into his decision for its rightness, much like I have when following Miles' stories.\"The solution had been lying around him in pieces all this time, invisible until he'd changed.

I've read both Shards of Honor and Barrayar, the next two books in the saga and Falling Free does not appear to relate, but that is just fine, because I liked this tale.Leo Graf, our main protagonist, is an engineer who is sent to work at the Cay Habitat in zero gravity with a group of very intelligent yet emotionally naive Quaddies. Quaddies are genetically engineered human beings bred with a second set of arms in place of legs (for a total of four arms). They were engineered in such a way as they do not suffer the typical side effects common to humans due to prolonged time in space, such as bone loss and atrophy of the muscles in the lower extremities. They were never intended to live their lives in space and were to serve as a space bound work force. Leo's job is to educate the Quaddies about engineering.\u201cThis is the most important thing I will ever say to you. The human mind is the ultimate testing device. You can take all the notes you want on the technical data, anything you forget you can look up again, but this must be engraved on your hearts in letters of fire. There is nothing, nothing, nothing, more important to me in the men and women I train then their absolute personal integrity. Whether you function as welders or inspectors, the laws of physics are implacable lie detectors. You may fool men. You will never fool metal. That\u2019s all.\u201d \u2015 Lois McMaster Bujold, Falling FreeLeo soon finds himself in a bit of an ethical dilemma. He does not like the pretended benevolence with which the Quaddies are treated by their care takers and recognizes it as actually something more akin to the type of patriarchal benevolence practiced by a master toward a slave. In fact, as it turns out, the Quaddies are less than slaves, if that is possible, as they are characterized as post-fetal experimental tissue cultures. This is particularly significant when, suddenly deemed obsolete, the Company decides to sterilize the entire lot of Quaddies and house them downside somewhere until they die.Leo teaches the very naive and childlike (most really are technically children) Quaddies that they are to be valued as any other human being and he helps them break away from the care takers in order to strike out on their own among the stars.I've read multiple reviews of this book and overall people tend to believe this book to be passable but definitely not one of Bujold's best. Personally I find that Falling Free has some of the most honest and brave character portrayals, showing people as they really are... hovering somewhere in the realm between good and evil. Certainly there are characters that cross the line, but most of us have our moments good or bad) and these characters do too. They, like most humans, make decisions based on their own self-interest, even the good/right decisions. And, as with much of humanity over history, the people in this book have found ways to neatly reason their trespasses. This tale also explores what can happen to a person who does not value their self-worth, that they might sell themselves cheaply, as does Silver, a very bright and pretty Quaddie who she allows her body to be used for small favors.Leo is a true hero. He puts himself in the line of fire, so to speak, in order to help the Quaddies escape sterilization and an unjust imprisonment for the chance to begin a new life on their own.\u201cThere was no limit to what one man might do, if he gave all, and held back nothing.\u201d \u2015 Lois McMaster Bujold, Falling FreeThis story has a happy ending. I wouldn't have it any other way.All of that said, Falling Free is none too subtle. It makes some very clear statements about slavery, prejudice, humanity and what constitutes humanity, justice, honesty, and human duty. While I appreciate subtlety, I can tolerate Bujold's presentation here. It works for me.There is one thing about which I did experience a bit of discomfort with regards to this tale, and it may be simply my misunderstanding, and I hope this is the case. The Quaddies are described as being children essentially, teenagers. Yet, their caretakers encourage them to mate on cue. In other words, they decide who should try to become pregnant, and with whom. Like cattle, eh? I am uncomfortable with this on the one hand and yet, I had to keep reminding myself, on the other hand, teenagers do have sex and have children and while this isn't the preference, it happens all over the world and is acceptable in many cultures. In that regard I can't find a lot of fault with it, and this further lends to the bravery had honesty with which this story was written. In that, it challenges some of our long held understandings of what is \"supposed\" to be right and wrong.To me, this is what good writing is all about."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5054531-becky", "userReview": "I wasn't sure how I felt about a Bujold novel without either Cordelia or Miles, but I shouldn't have worried and this was an easy read.

Unfortunately, that makes for a very black and white conflict, which felt a little flat at times.

The story is about the origin of the quaddies, humans genetically engineered for work in free fall, whose most striking adaptation is the replacement of their legs with arms (and hands). Leo Graf is an engineer and teacher assigned to the habitat where the quaddies are being \u201creared\u201d. The corporation he works for intends to use them for free fall work, thus avoiding the costly planetside leaves necessary to ensure good health for normal humans. The thousand quaddies are young, the oldest only just out of adolescence, and are being treated like children, with no voice in their future. Legally, they are the property of the corporation, even as they live their lives, work hard, even procreate. As artificial gravity is invented, the quaddies become instantly obsolete, the need for free fall work decreasing dramatically. They are no longer cost effective for the company, which orders the experiment terminated, meaning sterilization and confinement to barracks (read, prison) on a planet. For the free fall adapted quaddies, gravity wells are an unnatural, dangerous and generally terrible environment. At this point Graf rebels and plans the exodus of the quaddies, away to make their own lives.This is one of the best novels I have ever read. The characters, \u201cnormal\u201d and quaddie alike are well rounded, interesting, authentic. Bujold quickly manages to turn the quaddies from freaks into just \u201cdifferent humans\u201d in the mind of the reader. The plot is excellently constructed, with disparate elements and personalities meshing well to create an engaging whole with many page turner moments.The illustrations of morality are particularly poignant. The company brass thinks of the quaddies as little more than animals. Creatures to be disposed of when their usefulness has run its course. Leo Graf and some of the other staff, on the other hand, sees them as people, as children to be protected. The parallels with slavery are obvious, but more clever is the message that corporate leaders often have a lack of scruples making them morally little better than the slave-masters of previous centuries.
