It received a lot of positive reviews and was described as a coming-of-age story set in the Texas panhandle. I don't know who the hell's definition of coming-of-age involves statutory rape, some good old fashion date rape, and a totally implausible lead character. Laura is 16 and has filled her mother's role in cooking, cleaning, and providing child care to her 3 brothers after her mother and older sister abandon the family. So, logically, she decides to have a sexual relationship with a 35 year-old married father of two. The author spends a lot of time describing the sex scenes and very little time developing the character of the cradle robber. I felt totally gross reading this. I kept reading it hoping he would die or she would hit her head really hard. Needless to say, the ending was less satisfying."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14240703-nicole", "userReview": "I just can't rate this book. Here's what I can say: I'm glad I'm finished with it. I was interested in how the book turned out, mostly because I was waiting on Laura and John to get caught, one of the older family members who knew about the affair to do something about it, or for someone to put an end to it. As I put the book down each evening, I felt scuzzy about even reading it. I mean, who writes (or reads) a book about a married man in his 30s carrying on with a 16 year old girl for a year (and even goes so far as to call it \"love making\" several times)?! There are aspects of the story that are compelling (her mom and sister leave, she steps up, death of a boy, etc.), but I can't get over the repeated raping of this poor girl who was powerless against this grown man, especially since it is written as of it were a love story. This is not okay. No. No. No."}, {"userName": "Sara Strand", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10582065-sara-strand", "userReview": "The quick and dirty of this book is that it focuses around a family of 5 kids, specifically the middle child, Laura Tate. The mother leaves- which is the catalyst for lots of things in Laura's life specifically her relationship with a married man. One she babysits for no less. But what is amazing about this book is that you really kind of root for Laura and John, even though you know that it's wrong. You sympathize with Laura because at the tender age of 16 she doesn't really understand that every action has a reaction. She believes that if nobody knows then nobody really gets hurt and everything is ok- which hello? I think we all learned in college that life doesn't work that way. :)The other part of the book that really kind of tugged at me was the mother leaving. Through the whole book you are trying to look for clues because it's like you want to solve that mystery for them. You can assume what some excuses would be but really? Who could do that. There is a part where Laura wonders if maybe the life her mother had, a husband and children, even though it's what she had always wanted- maybe it really felt like a cage to her. Like she was trapped and couldn't leave- that that was her life forever. And really? I can sympathize that. I mean I have always wanted to be married with kids and all Suzie-Homemaker and here I am. But sometimes I feel like this is it. This is my life and I'm not quite satisfied. Like I'm missing a big piece of me or something. Does that make sense?But this book really hooked me. And even though some things you know are morally wrong are happening (like the affair) you really do kind of root for her. Probably because you know in your own life you can't do that.This is a FANTASTIC author and highly recommend his book. I look forward to other books in the future of his- great writing that really pulls you in."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9931126-cindy", "userReview": "First of all, let me say that I do not condone the behaviors in this book. In fact, they made me squirm! That being said, this book is NOT about the right and wrong of the behaviors! If that is all you focus on, you will think it an abomination! This book centers on sixteen-year-old, Laura. It explores how the choices of the \"adults\" (and I have to really stretch to call them that) in her life ultimately funnel down and affect her. You will find yourself wanting to protect this girl as you witness her fledgling efforts to navigate a world far too complex for one so unequipped. The author captures, beautifully, the child/adult psyche of a teenager. When, like a tender seedling, Laura's own wisdom starts to emerge, you will want to cry, laugh, yell, give \"high-fives\" and shout \"hallelujah!\""}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1646158-leslie", "userReview": "Imagine a baseball game in which the pitcher throws the same pitch to every batter for all 9 innings.

How a man could develop the character of a teenage girl so believably is a feat that not many are able to achieve. What you will find is a lovely, sad, hopeful tale of a teenage girl trying to make her way through life without a mother to guide her, making choices shaped by her desire to feel like more than a replacement for the mother who abandoned a household of boys in an age when there weren't many choices for women."}, {"userName": "Noose", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14344323-noose", "userReview": "I liked it.

The woman had abandoned her family. No explanation, no nothing. What was there to admire in that. What? she wondered.\"Laura Tate is growing up in the Texas panhandle in the 1960s when her mother abandons her family. While I would classify this as a \"coming of age\" story, it's more about a girl who comes of age too quickly, and the focus is really WHY she makes the decisions she does, and the question of if she would have made the same choices had her mother stayed to guide her through the early stages of womanhood. I think that question is extremely powerful, and while the story got away from itself in some parts, I remained focused on that integral question.Laura finds herself involved with a man twice her age; at first it starts as an infatuation, and then it turns to love - albeit sixteen year old love - and then into somewhat of an obsession before Laura has an epiphany that has you rooting almost out loud for her. We get a front row seat as Laura experiences desire, shame, love, hatred, disbelief, loss of control, and a whole slew of other emotions as she navigates her clandestine relationship with John. \"She had wanted to believe that it was okay, that there was beauty in what they had done, and that the heat of flesh on flesh was a worthy thing, and sometimes pure, so pure, the closest she had ever come to that invisible life she sensed was on the other side of this life. But now she knew that she had just been deceiving herself.\""}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16524-andrea", "userReview": "I won this book online on a blog that I had visited, and to be honest, that is why I chose to read this book -- it was free, and it was on my bookshelf. The book was an easy read, and I enjoyed reading it. I found myself having a hard time putting it down. It was one of those books where I wanted to get to the end of each chapter and then start immediately on the next just to see what would happen next. Laura Tate, the main character in the book, has an affair with a married man, and at times, I felt kind of weird for enjoying the story as much as I did, given the fact that she was 16 years old and he was a grown man, and as much as she was involved and interested in the relationship and in the man, I can't help but believe an older man who is sleeping with a 16 year-old girl has to be taking advantage of her. Nonetheless, the story had some suspense to it at times, and that kept my interest. I've passed the book on to two others who have read it and enjoyed it, so I would definitely recommend this book to others to read."}, {"userName": "Bill Hopkins", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19009917-bill-hopkins", "userReview": "Excellent for the first 80%. I was really absorbed and could not put it down. Loved the writing style. Characters seemed realistic and nostalgic at the same time. Great book about growing up in the late 50's in small-town Texas. I could almost imagine myself in some of the scenes. Reminded me of The Last Picture Show. A few shortcomings. The ending is disappointing. Maybe I just don't like happy endings but this was just too wholesome. I felt like the author wasn't sure how to end the story and just grabbed scenes from a feel-good tv movie. The sermon at the funeral should be cut out. The scene between Laura and Anne was laugh out loud ridiculous. I decided to give the book 5 stars anyway because I liked most of it a lot. Really its 4 .5. Five stars for the first 80% and about 2 stars for the last part."}, {"userName": "Vivian", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9737165-vivian", "userReview": "I did not love this book. The relationship between the main character and her \"lover\" made me want to scream. What was amazing though was that although this book was written by a male author, he truly captured the angst of young love in a pubescent girl's life. This book really hit on the concept of the vulnerability of a young motherless girl who just desperately wanted to be loved. The reality that a grown man would take advantage of this need is horrifyingly spot on. Could not put this one down."}, {"userName": "Tessyohnka", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6726621-tessyohnka", "userReview": "Well, there was way too much detail in this book about sex between a teenage girl and a man twice her age for my taste -- and the scene between that teenage girl and the man's wife near the end of the story was something out of a terrible movie. I'm giving it three stars instead of only two, however, because the scene with Mrs. Tate and the tree was so intriguing as was her reaction to the birth of Greta's pups and because most of the characters were well crafted until Mrs Letig's transition into something strangely not believable."}, {"userName": "Len Joy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13413308-len-joy", "userReview": "A sixteen year old girl has an affair with a man twice her age in a small Texas town circa 1960.
