This is the first of the Miss Julia books by Ann B. Ross that I have read, and it can be read as a standalone, but I feel like it's best to read them as a series. There was a good deal of flashbacks/recaps of prior events, and I got kind of lost in those sections, wanting the story to move more quickly. Nonetheless, this was still enjoyable, and I loved several of the characters because they felt so real. Miss Julia was so entertaining, and Sam, Hazel Marie, Little Lloyd, and Lillian were all very endearing."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4191554-debbie", "userReview": "Miss Julia can't help but make me smile.

In this novel, Julia remembers back to how things were when Little Lloyd and his mother Hazel Marie first moved into her home---especially that first Christmas and how much they have added to her life. Although there is another plot by her scheming uncle Vernon Puckett to keep Hazel Marie from having access to Little Lloyd's inheritance, this plot line lacked the spunky spirit shown by Miss Julia in previous novels. It felt like more of a rehash of the past than some new adventure she was getting into."}, {"userName": "Anne Hawn Smith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2393446-anne-hawn-smith", "userReview": "This book is entertaining, but a the back flash of Christmas is a little confusing. I was listening using an audiobook and I wasn't sure if it had been recorded wrong. Nevertheless, it was entertaining as are all the books in the series.When Hazel Marie's dastardly uncle comes back, he wrecks havoc with the household. He is bound and determined to prove that little Lloyd is not Wesley Lloyd's son and not heir to the Springer money.

I love the way the author takes a character, Miss Julia, with oodles of flaws (snobby, out-of-touch with the real world) and grows her into a loving, generous person.I doubt if I will listen to any other books in this series because there is so much recapping of previous stories it would drive me batty.

Ross\u2019s delightful series. Hazel Marie has settled in as part of the family, with Miss Julia's working hard to get Hazel Marie and Little Lloyd accepted by the members of the church community. Then Sam, Miss Julia's husband, hears from the cousin of Hazel Marie who kidnapped Little Lloyd in the first book. Brother Vernon Puckett, a self-styled preacher, has come up with claims that Little Lloyd is not the son of Miss Julia's late husband but rather another man she was seeing at the same time. Determined not to allow Brother Vernon Puckett from getting his way, Miss Julia and Sam work to find the truth and keep Little Lloyd from losing his inheritance.Read the rest of this review, more reviews, and other wonderful, geeky articles on FangirlNation"}, {"userName": "Sherrill Watson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26093561-sherrill-watson", "userReview": "Julia is in her 70s; formerly married to Wesley Lloyd Springer, now married to Sam, a former ('cause he's old) lawyer.

Meanwhile, Little Lloyd has endeared himself to her and to us, and so has Hazel Marie Prickett.

She is like a madcap Angela Lansbury careening through her small southern town trying to please everyone while dealing with her many personal crazy friends and relations.

Ross's most recent novel, Miss Julia's School of Beauty, was a New York Times extended bestseller, with more fans drawn to Miss Julia's adventures every outing. Miss Julia Stands Her Ground finds our steel magnolia looking forward to many peaceful and happy years with her new husband, Sam. But she still has plenty to worry about. When Hazel Marie's troublemaking uncle, Brother Vernon Puckett, comes back to town, he claims to have conclusive proof that Little Lloyd is not the son of Miss Julia's late, philandering husband Wesley Lloyd Springer-a fact to which Miss Julia would have gladly subscribed a few years back. But that was then, before Miss Julia's life revolved around Little Lloyd, before that magical holiday when he became the apple of her eye.With DNA testing the only possible way to settle the dispute, Miss Julia shudders at the thought of exhuming her dead husband's body. But her housekeeper Lillian has a few souvenirs of Wesley Lloyd's life tucked away that, though a little creepy, might just be the key to ending the whole ugly mess.

Miss Julia is an opinionated, willful southern woman (who asks her new husband \"Oh Sam, what should I do?\") whose truly awful husband of 45 years has died. Julia takes in his mistress and her son by this bozo. This is so comically stereotypical that you'll think it was written in the 50's - including the black servant with the slow drawl.

The aspersion-casting culprit is none other than Brother Vern, aka Vernon Puckett, Hazel Marie's uncle. If you like plot surprises, DO NOT read the book jacket; it's a plot spoiler. One thing I like a lot about this book is Julia's reminiscences about Christmases Past: first those with the odious, miserly, stingy Wesley Lloyd, then her first Christmas with Hazel Marie and Little Lloyd. These chapters give us valuable glimpses into what she became under Wesley Lloyd\u2019s spirit-crushing influence, and what she became without it.Through the flashback we discover how Miss Julia\u2019s brittle exterior finally began to crack and her frozen-over center to soften. We learn why the cream of Abbotsville society found it in its best interest (pun not intended but highly appropriate) to include Hazel Marie in their social circle. We see Miss Julia\u2019s progression in her feelings for Little Lloyd, and get a bit teary when he recaptures for her the true spirit of Christmas. Now we know why she cherishes him. And now we know that nothing will change how she feels about that little boy, no matter what.One thing I criticize is an amateurish carelessness about the book's timeline. In the space of just a few days, Ross whipsaws us from what should be late September to early December. That alone would have warranted a three-star rating in my view, since that is so basic, but the flashback redeems it.Read more in my Miss Julia blog at http://bit.ly/1KzWrZI."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1638879-linda", "userReview": "This may be my favorite of the series so far. It's near Christmas when Miss Julia (a lady of a certain age) finds out from her new husband that her late husband's illegitimate son might actually have a different father. However, since Miss Julia has come to love Little Lloyd and his mother as the family she never had, this news devastates her.She and her husband Sam determine the best course of action is to keep this a secret and work it out on their own. Fate intervenes of course and 1/4 of the book takes us in a flashback to Miss Julia's 1st Christmas as a widow and her 1st Christmas with Little Lloyd and his mother, Hazel Marie. It is very telling, moving and answers a lot of questions about the unusual family.The subplot is that forces inside her church want to stir up trouble by nominating Miss Julia to be the first woman to sit on this particular congregations Session.Sometimes Miss Julia comes off a bit ridiculous and ungrateful.

Miss Julia is a lovely southern belle in comtemporary times. She is widowed from a disappointing long term marriage that continues to haunt her into her new marriage. Miss Julia is the perfect southern, Christian woman; so forgiving and suuportive of all the people that her deceased husband used and discarded before his sudden death. His rich estate left Miss Julia carefree except for the fatherless son that fortuitously appears, and the unscrupulous minister whose church stood to inherit all and leave Miss Julia out in the cold.

It almost felt like Ross decided to fill in some holes that she wished had been included in the first few books.
