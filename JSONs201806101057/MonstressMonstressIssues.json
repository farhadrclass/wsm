It's feisty, it's creepy, it's bloody and it's beautiful and I have to say that I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed this which I picked up on a whim. I hadn't heard anything about this before it was released, in fact the only reason I picked it up was for the stellar cover art, but my goodness I am thrilled that I did because already i have a new favourite series and I am desperate for the next one to come out. This story focuses on a world where mutants, monsters and humans live with the humans dominating the monsters. The humans can buy and sell the creatures for as much or as little as they please, essentially they're slaves, and it's a world which has come to pass because of a big war which happened previously.We follow Maika who is a very human-like monster who has been bought as a slave by a wealthy lady. The Lady Sophia who buys her is evil and corrupt and she sees her 'purchases' as just that, property. She thinks she is allowed to do all sorts of horrible and cruel things, but Maika is not so sure she agrees and she has different ideas.This is a triple-length issue with over 70pgs so I would highly recommend snatching it up right away! You get an awful lot of explanation about the world (very necessary to effectively hook you in and keep you interested) and you also get to see that this place is not a place you'd want to be, despite the beautiful artwork of some of the scenes.I adored the colour and art work for this, It's flawless and timeless with some oriental influences and stellar imagery which stands out to you instantly. I couldn't put this down once I started reading it and I am so very excited to get the next issue whenever it's out and hope to continue the story which has only just begun.I would HIGHLY recommend this if you like weird, creepy, beautiful, disturbing, feisty tales because it's all of that and more. Also, there's a SUPER CUTE fox-cub child who is my favourite character and is so beautiful (how can anyone want to hurt her!?) 5*s for sure, fantastic!!!"}, {"userName": "Heidi The Hippie Reader", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-hippie-reader", "userReview": "I wasn't impressed by Monstress. The story is downright confusing until the end of each issue when the reader is given a history lesson (info dump) by a talking cat with multiple tails. Let me attempt a summary of just the beginning (it gets really complicated after that):There's a teen. There's something special about her but we're not sure what. She's purchased by a religious cult with others of her kind. They're shipped to a prison fortress and tortured- for what, who knows? Maika (the girl) knows that she has to get out of this horrible place, but her \"power\" is unreliable. There are a bunch of flashbacks to explain where Maika came from and it seems to be as awful as where she is now. Will she survive? Will she figure out what her power is and learn to control it? Will anybody tell me what the heck is going on? Who are these witch/nuns? And why does the fox girl have such big eyes?I managed to get into the story towards the end, but I was completely turned off by the F-bombs peppered throughout the text. I mean, there's a whole language to choose from, and that's the best you can do? I'm not opposed to a few well-timed ones, but it turned into the go-to exclamation. Also, what's up with the females who are drawn so un-lifelike that it looks like their balloon filled chests are going to float away at any moment? Now, to be fair, they weren't ALL ridiculously drawn, but some were. I understand that this kind of depiction is a stylistic choice, but it's not my cup of tea. In addition, there is some seriously disturbing and graphic violence in this. With the popularity of various Tarantino films, I know that this type of art has its audience. But, again, I am not in the audience.The bad guys in this are really, really bad, like unbelievably so. I think graphic novels are more fun when there are grey areas. Torturing children doesn't leave a whole lot of room for sympathy.I wanted to like Monstress as it has a lot of things that I do enjoy: magic, steampunk, gods, fairy-type creatures. But, there was just so much more that I didn't like, that it soured the experience for me. I understand that I'm in the minority here so if you're a graphic novel aficionado you may want to give Monstress a read through anyway as many of my friends seemed to enjoy it."}, {"userName": "Mitticus", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4765800-mitticus", "userReview": "There is more hunger in the world than love.\nGorgeous Art *_*plenty Violence - kind of psycho and sadistic related than war related.Mysterious Heroine, who can kick ass, (with just one arm)No romance , until now.\u00bfPost-apocaliptic? not sure yet.

So, when I heard that Marjorie Liu was creating a new comic book series called \u201cMonstress\u201d and I had heard a lot of good things about this series, I just had to check this series out!\nWhat is this story about?\nThe story starts off with Maika being sold to a witch named Sophia and it turns out that this was a part of plan that Maika conjured up when she was at her homeland to get inside the witches\u2019 strong hold in order to find out what happened to her mother. It also turns out that Maika possesses a dangerous power where she is psychically linked to a monster of tremendous power and she is prone to have beastly urges whenever she is in danger. Now, not only does Maika have to control her dangerous powers, but she must survive the horrors of the war between the humans and the supernatural forces!\nWhat I loved about this story:\nMarjorie Liu\u2019s writing: Wow! For a first time reader of Marjorie Liu\u2019s works, I must say that I was quite impressed with Marjorie Liu\u2019s beautiful writing of this issue! I loved the way that Marjorie Liu wrote the world that the characters live in as it seems like Ancient China with some supernatural touches to the universe that really made this world so mesmerizing to read about. I also loved the way that Marjorie Liu wrote Maika\u2019s character as Maika is shown as being a strong female protagonist who suffers a horrific injury as she loses her arm in the war and yet is still determined enough to sneak into the witches\u2019 strong hold to find out the truth about her mother. I also think that the beastly aspect of Maika\u2019s character really made her interesting and I would love to see where they take her character in the next issue!Sana Takeda\u2019s artwork: Sana Takeda\u2019s artwork is just simply beautiful to look at! I just loved the way that Sana Takeda made the characters\u2019 hairs glow throughout the pages, especially with Maika\u2019s long and raven hair glowing at various places of her head. I also loved the way that Sana Takeda drew the steampunk aesthetics to the story as we see many machines and rusted pipes throughout the artwork and it really gives the story a dark and gritty futuristic feel.\nWhat made me feel uncomfortable about this story:\nFor anyone who does not like strong language, there were a couple of utterings of the \u201cf\u201d word throughout the story that might offend some people. Some readers might want to skim through the curse words if they get offended by them.\nFinal Thoughts:\nOverall, \u201cMonstress Volume One: Awakening Part One\u201d is a truly fantastic introduction to Marjorie Liu\u2019s \u201cMonstress\u201d series and I definitely cannot wait to check out the next few issues of this series!Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog"}, {"userName": "Alice Cai", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67934812-alice-cai", "userReview": "0.25* I feel kind of bad because other people really like it and I genuinely think it's shit. I can't figure out what's good about this at all. HOW IS THIS GOOD? I'M SO CONFUSED.

Hungry for blood and desperate answers she seeks to stealthily destroy everything in her wake to find out more about her mother, her past and the power that grows poisonous within her.Nothing will stop her, not even death. Hence, with her killer one-hand moves and crafty mind she infiltrates Zamara, a city where human witches capture Arcanic slaves, all for the sake of experimental testing and thus, begins Maika Halfwolf's tale.Firstly, this spectacular art deserves credit for bringing the story to life. I mean you can practically feel the evil glint resonating in her eyes.The story takes place in a dark, miserable, prejudiced world where death and fear simultaneously knock on everyone's door No one can forget the events that occurred and no forgiveness resounds.

The world building is just beginning, yet is quite intriguing. Our main character is Maika who's on a quest both internally and externally. She's fighting the monster inside her, and has gone after witches who are caught in a bloody war. At least that's what I think so far. I'm sure there are many twists and turns to come. The characters are diverse. Some human, some half human, and some monsters. The setting is Asian in feel but an altiverse to our own.

I really can\u2019t stress enough how much I loved all the imagery. I will readily admit to being a complete novice when it comes to comics, having read pretty much just Saga and Locke and Key, but even as a novice I feel secure in saying that this is one comic that you just can\u2019t miss. Even if you are not into comics, it is worth picking up, maybe discover a love for a different style of story telling. And, as an added bonus (because quite frankly I would want to read this just for the art), the story is definitely quite intriguing as well.Maika may look human, but there is more to her than originally meets the eye. We are introduced to her as she is being auctioned off as a monster, the auctioneer touting her unique human appearance. The only flaw they mention her missing half an arm. So, we have a beautiful protagonist with a disability, labeled as a monster and a mysterious background! Definitely peaked my interest.In this first issue, we are introduced to a fantastic world that is portrayed with breathtaking images. We get glimpses of others \u201cmonsters\u201d with Maika, we can see they are not human, but variances among them look very cool. And the fox girl? She is absolutely adorable. I will admit, I left this first issue felling like I am not fully understanding where these individuals come from or what their abilities may be. I just know they are not human and are sold as slaves. I really want to learn more about who and what they are, and what makes the humans feel entitled to treat them as a commodity rather than actual people with rights, so I will continue to read in hopes of getting answers. The first issue is only 72 pages, and is not meant to answer all the questions, its meant to be an introduction and leave you wanting more. And it strongly succeeded at that.Maika comes across as very strong, a woman with a past that we\u2019ve yet to really learn about. A woman who has secrets and has powers that she can tap into. And a woman who will not hesitate to kill when she needs to. She may have been sold as a slave at auction, but she certainly is not submissive. Pretty much she is the rather kick ass type of character that I love.As much as I focused on the beauty of this comic, I should mention it is also brutal. The imagery is captivating, but can also be bloody and violent. If gore and violence are bothersome or disturbing for you, then just be warned you will find a bit of that. This is a mature comic and as such is intended for a mature audience.Overall, I found Monstress to be a wonderful balance of beauty and darkness. This first issue left me feeling like I\u2019ve just been introduced to Maika and her world. I have more questions, but I see them as reasons to read on and watch for that next issue!

It was all so amazing I cant recommend it enough. The premise is kind of hard to explain. Its about a girl who infiltrates a witch stronghold by posing as a slave in the hopes of finding someone they took from her. This is definitely one of the better graphic novels Ive read. I absolutely loved the artwork. It was very detailed and rich. The art told as much of the story as the writing. It was so beautiful and captivating. It portrayed the dark and twisted story wonderfully. I thought the concept for the premise was really interesting. The story was very imaginative and unique. I havent read anything like this. The plot and the art was so creative and worked so well together. It was just the right amount of bloody action and feisty attitude for me. It didnt take long for me to feel connected to the characters and root for them. We all have a little weird inside and I think a lot of people cant relate to that. I thought the little fox was just the cutest thing in the world and I wanted to protect her.I also enjoyed how well developped it felt. I usually feel like the story in graphic novels is missing something due to the lack of writing but this wasnt the case with this story.

ARTWORK. ARTWORK.+ The storyline in this book is pretty good. It\u2019s definitely one that\u2019s worth a try. Though I did have a few problems with the info-dump during the previous page of every chapter that I may or may not have read-slash-understood.+ This book was a bit creepy. And it\u2019s the good kind of creepy, by the way. One of the scenes I loved the most were those with the gigantic eyeball. I love that dude.+ GOOORE! I\u2019d probably recommend this books for older teens (though I\u2019m not sure I can actually say something about that, because I\u2019m only 15 and I\u2019ve already managed to read and love this comic). Moving on, this book had a handful of gore in it and it was AWESOME. If you\u2019re a fan of violence like I am, then you\u2019re in for a treat, my friend.+ DIVERSITY!

Okay, it does makes sense for her to be a bit of an unhappy one: she's an orphan, struggles to survive the trauma of war and also lost half an arm somewhere along her way.

Gorgeous!!! Whats even better, is this first issue is longer than usual, almost double issue, so there is much more to admire. Beautiful. The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 is because there is so much still to be revealed, so much that I don't know. But it has an amazing start. I have a feeling I am going to adore this heroine (anti-heroine? who knows, we shall see...). I am absolutely excited that we are getting more comics with bad ass females leads. I can not wait for the next issue!!"}, {"userName": "Mei", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6876967-mei", "userReview": "I received this book from Netgalley for my honest review. WOW!!!It's been a while I've read comics, but this one is plain and simple fantastic!The graphic is excellent and the detail wonderful!Each table is a small work of art!The story is also very, very interesting and the change between the action parts and the revealing past parts is perfectly balanced!There're not enough words to described how much I enjoyed reading (and looking) this series!Beautiful, haunting and poignant.Very recommended to all who enjoy great comics!"}, {"userName": "Giedre", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5487874-giedre", "userReview": "Marjorie Liu and Sana Takeda make a great team. It's a bigger first issue, which was a clever way to start Monstress\u2014I'm definitely hooked. Though I might wait for the whole first volume to come out, because I don't enjoy reading separate issues as much. We'll see.
