I have to say, Sarah Crossan is killing it with these kinds of books. She manages to capture so many emotions while saying so little, it's so impressive. Sometimes it's nice to read a book where the majority of descriptions are left out and what's on paper is just the core of the story. I would 100% recommend this because it's wonderful, powerful and beautiful. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\"it was all about how things looked from the outside; what other people thought was all that was important, and how we felt about ourselves was irrelevant. Our desires didn\u2019t matter.\"\u2018You stay in today, Joe, cos tomorrow\u2019s a story that ain\u2019t been written yet.No use in rehearsing it. No use at all.\u2019\"WHAT CAN WE FORGIVE?

We\u2019re dirt.Although,I guess that\u2019s a lot easier than having to admitthat by killing our brotherthey\u2019re just pummeling more people.\n Sarah Crossan has done it again.  Moonrise is a heartbreaking YA novel written in verse dealing with a very serious issue - the death penalty. Focusing on the family of the guy on death row, we're enlightened to the impact of capital punishment on those who weren't sentenced. The issues of poverty, parental neglect, a flawed criminal justice system, and police coerced confessions are all present in the story as well.We're with Joe when he is seven years old receiving a phone call to the house phone from his older eighteen year old brother Ed saying he was arrested. The book then jumps forward ten years when Joe is arriving in Wakeling, Texas from New York because his brother called and said he needs him. The execution date is set. Joe is going to do what he can to help even if that just means being there.\nI\u2019m here \u2018cause he\u2019s my blood.He needs me.It\u2019s what I have to do.But if I had a choice?I\u2019d be on a plane home\u2013 I\u2019d be gone.\nThroughout are flashbacks where Joe remembers the past when Ed and his mother were still around. These help to illustrate the relationships Joe had within his family and how things changed once Ed went to prison. It becomes clear Joe looked up to his brother and had a deep love for him. So to see him for the first time ten years later behind plexiglass is huge. Joe wants to understand and have all the time he can with his older brother while they still can.\u201cI\u2019d still be sitting here if you did it.I\u2019d know you didn\u2019t deserve this.\u201dWhat struck me most were things I understood too well. That realization and need to understand that you can't just call and reach someone in prison whenever you want. The need to be there for a person who needs you regardless of the emotional toll it's taking on you because if family can't be there, then who else will? My heart broke for Joe. I can't even grasp being told my brother is sentenced for execution. To come to terms with a date of death set on the calendar is just outrageous to think about. But it's not something we should just ignore.This is a book that will stick with me. It's emotional, well-written, and beyond thought-provoking. Crossan is my all-time favorite free verse writer. Her books are all fairly quick reads because of her writing style, but damn are they powerful! This was my third book from Crossan and most certainly won't be my last."}, {"userName": "Colleen Fauchelle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16800062-colleen-fauchelle", "userReview": "It made me cry."}, {"userName": "Kate~Bibliophile Book Club", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9841866-kate-bibliophile-book-club", "userReview": "Stunning book. I didn\u2019t expect to get so invested in it to be honest, it\u2019s not my usual kind of read. But I couldn\u2019t put it down. Super short chapters give a sense of urgency to the story and it really draws you in. Just beautiful.Moonrise was one of the December book club choices in Rick O\u2019Shea\u2019s Book Club over on Facebook, so naturally I was curious enough to download this from my local library and see what it was like. I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be so good!As the blurb says, Joe hasn\u2019t seen his brother in a decade as Ed is on Death Row. But now the inevitable has happened, a date has been set for his execution, so Joe decides to go and spend the last few weeks near Ed to try to make up for lost time.Moonrise follows Joe in those few weeks, through hope and desperation, as he spends time with Ed. It is a really great narrative as Joe gets a job close to the prison and he also meets people from the town near the prison. This isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing, as not everyone is too pleased to be talking about Ed and what he did/ didn\u2019t do.The further in to Moonrise I got, the more I started to hope along with Joe. They were appealing Ed\u2019s case, hopeful for a stay of execution, or wrongful imprisonment, and with each hurdle Joe\u2019s resilience takes another knock. I really felt for him as a character. I just wanted it all to work out.Moonrise is a brilliant story. It will put you through an emotional wringer. I got invested in the characters, so much so that I still think about them weeks after reading. I just loved how this book got under my skin.Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Figgy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5056662-figgy", "userReview": "Review to come.

Moonrise is a poignant and provoking narrative of seventeen year old Joseph Moon and his brother who is scheduled to be executed in Kirkland Texas.As children, Edward, Angela and Joseph were often neglected, their mother a verbally abusive alcoholic. Parental responsibilities are entrusted to Karen, their mother's single, Christian sister. At seventeen years of age, Edward escaped the confines of their regimented home only to be incarcerated for the death of a police officer. Edward's execution has been scheduled and despite Karen's disapproval, Joseph begins his journey to farewell his brother. The narrative is incredibly distressing as the responsibility is placed upon Joseph, temporarily living within the decrepit Kirkland motel, abandoned by Karen and Angela. Capital punishment is a contentious discussion, sanctioned throughout the United States although abolished in Australia. Intense and confronting, the nonlinear narrative explores the familial relationship between siblings. Edward has been imprisoned for ten years and estranged from his siblings and with their mother absent, Karen has denied Angela and Joseph access to their brother. Sarah Crossan is a monumental storyteller and with so few words is, able to captivate and immerse readers.

Verse can make it more difficult to get a sense of the characters emotions, and in hand makes it harder to find a connection to them - equaling to a story you feel nothing for.THIS book, however, somehow manages to avoid doing this and accomplishes in going further than just gently tugging on our emotions.

I have only ever read Crossan's ya dystopian books (Breathe and Resist) which I really enjoyed and hoped this would be another winner. It was.Moonrise follows Joe Moon who travels to Texas from New York to see his older brother, Ed, who is on Death Row. This book is written entirely in verse which makes the story punchier and hard-hitting, and works really well with the subject matter discussed. Honestly, this book made me feel an array of emotions and I was utterly devastated by the ending. I think Death Row will always be a highly controversial topic (and rightly so) and this depiction tugged at my heartstrings. Moonrise forced me to question the ethics and morality behind Death Row and the injustices which prevail in a severely flawed and corrupt system. The fact that such tragedies still occur in modern society is heartbreaking.A powerful read which will stay with me for a long time to come."}, {"userName": "Lotte", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2461086-lotte", "userReview": "Ik dacht: ik lees even een stukje in dit boek - en vier uur later had ik hem uit.

But it's also a book about love in all its forms, and about life and injustice and hope in hopeless situations.I don't know how she does it, because I am agressively opposed to free verse poetry (in fact, if I'm honest, I hate all poetry) but her words are just so beautiful and readable and her characters are so real and complex and vulnerable, I literally can't get enough of this author's writing.There is romance in the book, but it complements the main story instead of overshadowing it or seeming to be included for the sake of it. While Moonrise is a criticism of police brutality and of capital punishment, but it never goes overboard with condemnation. This bookshould be required reading for everyone (*coughs* Daily Mail *coughs*) who has ever said 'Bring back hanging'. Crossan pitches her arguments perfectly for maximum effect using exactly the right words to leave you feeling like you've been put through the emotional wringer and stillbegging for more.

This is the second book I\u2019ve read by Crossan. I read One a few years ago and loved it. When I received Moonrise in the mail to review I was excited to read it. I\u2019m just going to get this out of the way now. Not a lot of books have made me cry but I\u2019ll admit that I was actually crying at the end of this book. Actual tears! Which for me means it was a really good book and one of the reasons I gave it five stars. I just got so attached to Joe and Ed and I wanted them to have a happy ending.In Moonrise, Ed is on death row for a crime he says he didn\u2019t commit. I\u2019m going to admit that I was a little skeptical at first. I know it\u2019s supposed to be innocent until proven guilty but Ed was in prison. No one wants to think the justice system screws up and that innocent people are, right now, sitting in prison for something they didn\u2019t do. And especially not on death row. But the justice system isn\u2019t perfect and mistakes are made. Innocent people have been executed and are imprisoned. This isn\u2019t related to the book but, for example, Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey. I believe they\u2019re both innocent. If you haven\u2019t seen Making a Murderer then I highly recommend it. Although it made me very angry. This book shows what happens when the justice system fails.But it also shows what one family is willing to do for someone they love. Even if they\u2019re aren\u2019t sure what to believe. Ed\u2019s family wants to be there for him at the end, when he needs them the most. Especially if it might be the last time they see each other.Moonrise is told in verse. I\u2019ve only read one other book told this way and it was also by Crossan and I loved that too. Even though it was sad. I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d be able to connect with the story or characters with the book being written this way but both Moonrise and One was amazing and so, so sad.I think I might have to pick up more of Crossan\u2019s books.

Whenever there is a murder, and someone is convicted and sentenced to death, we automatically feel for the victim's family. This book challenged me to look at it from the other side. The story is told from the point of view of Joe, a 17 year old man, who's brother had received his execution date after 10 years on death row. Joe was quite young, when his brother was incarcerated, but was determined to be with him during his final days. I really loved the way Crossan showed them reconnecting. We saw their interactions in the present, as well as flashbacks, which clearly illustrated Joe's love, affection, and admiration for his brother. Crossan also clearly illustrated the emotional toll Ed's impending death was having on Joe. He was dealing with some deep abandonment issues, and this just compounded those. The issue of capital punishment was what inspired this book, but it was the focus on the family dynamic, which captured my heart. The book is heartbreaking and left me in tears, but there was this underlying idea of family and love, which touched my heart. *ARC provided in exchange for an honest review.

Missing loved ones is tough and even though Joe tries to make the best of things he knows he hasn't been very lucky so far. I had tears in my eyes when I read about his situation.

Te ver van Joe en zijn labiele gezin om op bezoek te gaan. Wanneer de executiedatum bekend is, is Joe vastbesloten om zijn broer nog een keer te zien. Eenmaal in Texas bezoekt hij Ed elke dag in de gevangenis. \u201cEen soort niemandsland. Een plek waar niemand woont. Een tijdelijke opslagruimte.\u201dNa het lezen van dit boek moest ik even nadenken over wat ik in mijn recensie zou gaan zetten. Ik heb gelachen en gehuild, maar wauw dit boek is zo mooi. Er vliegen veel gedachten door mijn hoofd, maar hoe zet ik dit logisch op papier? Een gezin, of beter gezegd, een half uit elkaar gevallen gezin, probeert zo goed als het gaat te leven met de middelen die ze hebben. Vader is lang geleden overleden, zijn labiele moeder vertrok toen hij elf was en Ed vertrok toen Joe zeven was. Zijn zus Angela bleef bij hem en tante Karen kwam uiteindelijk om voor hen te zorgen.De band die Crossan beschrijft tussen Joe en Ed, is anders. Ze schreven brieven naar elkaar, maar hebben elkaar tien jaar niet gezien. Het is een vreemde, maar toch ook dezelfde. De Ed met wie hij vroeger speelde en Star Wars keek, is nu Ed die wacht op zijn dood, maar hoe goed kent Joe hem nog? \u201cJe kunt alle feiten weten over iemand - lengte, gewicht, hoe hij zijn ei graag eet - maar je zult nooit precies doorhebben wat zo iemand drijft.\u201dDe personages vind ik sterk neergezet. Ik geloofde Joe, maar ik geloofde ook in Ed. Bijna elke pagina gaat over de dood en de weg er naartoe, maar toch proef je af en toe ook een vleugje hoop. Hoop die je bijna niet wilt voelen, omdat je niet iets wilt hopen wat misschien niet waargemaakt wordt. \u201cHoop was niet echt mijn specialiteit.\u201dNet als \u2018Een\u2019 is dit boek ook geschreven in versvorm en ik vind dat zo bijzonder. Dat je in zo weinig woorden, zoveel kunt vertellen en zoveel los kunt maken. De hoofdstukken bestaan soms maar uit een paar zinnen, maar daardoor worden ze alleen maar belangrijker. De cadans van de zinnen zorgt soms voor een bepaalde rust en soms komt iets alleen maar harder binnen. Crossan snijdt dit onderwerp aan zonder zelf een oordeel te geven, ge\u00efnspireerd door een documentaire die in haar hoofd bleef hangen. Met dit boek laat Crossan zien dat een crimineel ook familie heeft, vrienden, mensen die van hem houden. En hoe stom de situatie ook is, het brengt de familie van Joe toch ook bij elkaar. Dit is een boek over de dood, hoop, maar ook veel liefde."}], "description": "'They think I hurt someone. But I didn't.
