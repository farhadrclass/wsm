The story of the 1500 Isabelle was very interesting, although could have been developed a little more, I think. I actually had a hard time putting the book down in the first three quarters or more. However, by the end, I was pretty much tired of it. Tired, because it was so odd and unbelievable, and I'd really stopped caring for Ella, the modern-day main character.I loved the idea of what was happening -- the same land, same family, a modern day version of the character trying to solve a puzzle or a mystery of what had happened to her long-ago counterpart. But there were parts of it that added nothing to the story and made the characters less likeable.I liked Ella a lot in the beginning, but didn't understand why the author gave her the relationship she did with Jean-Paul. It just didn't make sense, and didn't develop the story any more. Odd.I realize this sounds like I didn't like it at all. Which isn't true -- I did, but became sort of disillusioned with the characters in the end.I cared more about some of the side characters than I did for Ella -- Mathilde, Sylvie, Jacob, Susanne. And of course, Marie.This was definitely an interesting book, and I did learn quite a bit of French history while reading it. But I think the author had a great idea and didn't know how to write the story around it, so the rest was weak."}, {"userName": "Tea Jovanovi\u0107", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3103000-tea-jovanovi", "userReview": "Meni li\u010dno je ovo najdra\u017ea Trejsina knjiga...

I had read Girl With a Pearl Earring and been very impressed, so I picked up this one expecting something as good. Well, maybe not AS good, since The Virgin Blue was her first book and I was prepared to give her some wriggle room for growth and learning and so on.Let me say that I think the book's premise is very strong, and I really loved the 'flashbacks' to Isabella. In my opinion, these segments were strong and interesting and well-written.Where the book fell down was with Ella, the modern voice. I hated her character. I found her whiny and self-absorbed and I simply did not understand her motivations for the affair. The breakdown in the relationship with her husband simply did not get conveyed nearly enough, and I ended up feeling badly for Rick instead of seeing Ella's side. Truthfully, she had no side. Another thing that annoyed me was Ella's supposed fluency in French - achieved in just a month! I speak French, and there is no way that anyone would be able to argue about Vietnam and feminism and politics within a month of lessons. Come on. Really?Finally, the ending. What a let-down. I hated the way that the 'past' and the 'present' melded together. It was meant to be dramatic, but it made me roll my eyes. No suspense for me, no 'aha!' moment, nothing. Just a sense of relief that it was over at last. On the whole, I'd rate this as the poorest book that I have read by an otherwise quite remarkable author."}, {"userName": "Xeyra", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/651743-xeyra", "userReview": "Apparently, this was Tracy Chevalier's first novel, quite different from most of her other ones. I have read two other novels by this author, \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" and \"The Lady and the Unicorn\", and have enjoyed both very much. This author has a style that appeals to me, simple and straightfoward but with a beauty of its own in the way she captures the characters that compose her stories.Although I liked \"The Virgin Blue\", reading it in two days, I ended up fairly confused as to what had happened and why in some particular occasions. I couldn't understand the character's motivations, perhaps because I did not fully compreend the historical background in which part of it took place and what beliefs the people held. I was lost, at times, not understanding why some people reacted or acted the way they did and though some things are explained, many other questions were left unanswered in my mind. In fact, the ending was somewhat abrupt, at least where the past is concerned, as well as some of the relationships portrayed, which I thought moved too fast."}, {"userName": "Cat Tutt", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17037622-cat-tutt", "userReview": "4.5 starsThis book gets a pretty easy 4.5 stars from me. I'm a sucker for a good historical fiction with a female character researching her connection to her family's past, which is the basic sum of the plot. That said, this book had a lot going for it aside from my natural affinity for the plot line.I will admit that a lot of my historical fiction reading has been by certain authors and set in certain areas, which may make the book more novel to me than to a more widely read historical fiction fan, but the setting and historical backdrops were both somewhat unfamiliar to me. I've read books set in or around Paris, but not in the French countryside, as this is. I thought she did a nice job of painting a picture of what life might be like for an American woman moving to a small town in France. Picturesque and lovely, but also judgmental and nosy. I guess the judgmental and nosy part is universal in small towns. The other main setting of the book is the mountains of Switzerland, which was also new to me.I was wholly unfamiliar with the persecution of the Huguenots by the Catholics in that time and place, aside from having heard of St Bartholowmew's Massacre in passing. The book really fed my nerdy side with the historical references and explanations given on a subject I knew little about and took an immediate interest in.Trying to put aside my bias towards these sorts of books, I still feel it was a very strong story. There was good pacing with new story lines developing through the whole book, leading up to what I found to be rather a surprise ending. I thought the writing was very good and was descriptive without being over the top. My overall opinion of this book is that it would be a good choice for someone thinking of dipping a toe into the historical fiction genre. I feel like it has a faster pace and less background historical information than some I have read, which I take away .5 star for, but would make it a good foray into the genre for someone new to historical fiction."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/742077-anne", "userReview": "I picked it up and a day and a half later, I set it down. At first, I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, but 20 pages in and I was completely hooked. Since I haven't read anything else by Tracy Chevallier, I wasn't sure I would enjoy her writing. I was happy to discover she has a natural knack for character development, I found her to be a very honest author, unafraid to describe what \"we\" are really feeling inside. Exposing the vulnerability of human nature with her intertwining stories of love, hate, religion, persecution, adultery and redemption.The pace of the novel starts off a little slowly, there is a lot to get through to grasp all the characters and their roles. Halfway muddling through the French dialog was a little difficult at first, but well worth the effort. And as the story progressed, became more intense and began revealing the secrets shared by the two main characters, the chapters became shorter and shorter, the structure of the chapters began to change, which increased the pace set early on. My only wish is that there had been more follow through with a few revelations that Ella (our main character from the modern age) discovered about her ancestors. (specifically the painter Nicolas Tournier...Who was this cat after all? Tracy never says for sure) And I wish there had been more between Ella and Susanne her cousin from Switzerland; they shared the family secret but their relationship ended too quickly for me. And later with Ella and Elizabeth her cousin from France. They shared a kindred spirit, but Tracy left me desiring more of the relationships. Ella's feelings toward Elizabeth were contradictory with the way the story ended. At first she doesn't know if she wants to relate to her, but in the end she's spending quality time with Elizabeth but no reconsiliation has been made for her original emotions regarding Elizabeth and the Tournier family history. Also, there was no explanation as to who's teeth they discovered under the chimney at La Baume du Monsieur, Tracy discusses it briefly in regards to Hannah (the grandmother from the 1500's) and her belief that \"the home is safe, the hearth will protect us...\", it was a little confusing because it was never fully explained. And lastly, did they burry Marie near Deborah? She wanted to see her again. Did she finally rest near her? The only reason I can criticize these things is because I enjoyed the book so much, I wish there had been more to it. I was left wanting more...Is there any better compliment to an author?"}, {"userName": "Suzette", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1088728-suzette", "userReview": "Definitely not as good as Girl with a Pearl Earring. I was really enjoying the first two-thirds of the book, but I didn't like the direction it took after that. There are two parallel stories happening and the modern one is less believable than the one that takes places four hundred years ago. I liked the character Isabelle from the 1500's much better than Ella from modern day. I'll still read more by Chevalier.

Because one of the two main characters \"develops\" memories from her distant relative (distant being 400ish years ago), I started to wonder about memories and if we will ever figure out a way to \"harvest\" and save memories to be viewed when \"host\" is no longer with us. It seems crazy, but maybe at one time, it seemed crazy to think we could hear a voice or see a picture of someone long after they were gone. The story itself was very good, and I enjoyed the language the author used, her use of imagery and the way she described Ella's and Isabelle's feelings. What I did not appreciate was the way the book ended. I understand the agenda of an author to leave the reader to make up some bit of their own when tying up loose ends, but I think this author left too much to the imagination. I wanted to know more about what happens to Ella and what happened to Isabelle. But, I loved the history behind this story, I loved the use of the French language (which was awesome since I was listening to it in my car on the way to my class in Gorham), and I really loved this author's style of writing."}, {"userName": "Haydee", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/644911-haydee", "userReview": "Okay, maybe 1.5 stars is more fair. Anyway, this book annoyed the heck out of me! This is my third Chevalier novel(also read \"Girl w/ a Pearl Earring\" and \"The Lady and the Unicorn) and enjoyed the first two--this is her first novel and I think it shows. There are 2 main characters in this book--both women, but living centuries apart. Ella, the present-day character, is an American ex-pat living in France with her husband, and Isabelle is her distant ancestor living in France during the time of the Huguenots. My main problem with the novel is that Ella is just plain annoying--selfish, self-centered and self-absorbed. I'm supposed to sympathize with her because oh how women have suffered at the hands of men(including Isabelle, mostly b/c she had the \"misfortune\" of being born with red hair and having a fascination for the Virgin Mary in Protestant France--but that's another long story)! But boy, does she make it hard.In the end, I finished the novel b/c I was curious about what happened to Isabelle.

The interesting thing to me was that the story took place at two different times in history but in the same geographic area. The first chapter introduces us to Isabelle, a girl who lives in France in the 1600s during a religious upheaval. Isabelle is seen as odd by her town because of her red hair, which was uncommon at the time. In chapter two we meet Ella, an American who has moved to France with her husband. Over the course of the novel Ella searches out her family history and finds that her family originated near where she now lives. The story is historical fiction while also discussing changes in relationships, personal revelations, and major life changes for many of the characters. I especially found the story changes by chapter interesting, and the way that Chevalier integrates the two main characters\u2019 stories toward the end. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in historical fiction and world literature.

I liked the first one I read (The Lady and the Unicorn), I adored the second one I read (Falling Angels) and was disappointed with the third (The Girl in the Pearl Earrings). This is the 4th, and once again, disappointed. The thing that disappoints me most is that the subject material is so rich, I can see how the book could be so good. I know nothing about the Huguenots in France and would love to read more. I love history, I love genealogy and so forth. This could have been a really great story.Instead, one of the protagonists I really didn't care for (the modern Ella). I did like the way the author showed how it was difficult to adjust to life in small town France. The book described that well, in a way I could understand. But the character herself, I didn't much care for.The way the magical elements were woven into the story also didn't make sense to me. I found the blue dream hokey, the hair that grew mysteriously red overnight unbelievable, and so forth. I've read a lot of books with magical elements to them so that as a plot device or aspect of the story doesn't bother me. But it didn't fit well here.There were also lose ends that were never tied up and things that were never explained. I'm not referring to an open ended ending, which can be excellent sometimes. I'm referring to the painter that ended up being a dead end. Why was he even in the story? It did not move the plot forward or contribute in any way. It was frustrating.Finally, the sections taking place in the 1500s were confusing and hard for me to follow. I find the French way of writing dialog difficult to read. They never sound like characters speaking in my head. I also thought there were too many names and the action was difficult to follow. I ended up confused and had to read back a few pages to get the characters straight.Once again, highly disappointing since I love the idea behind it."}, {"userName": "Cami", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/682023-cami", "userReview": "This was a very interesting book about two women, centuries apart, linked through blood and circumstances. Ella Turner moves to France with her husband Rick for his job. She has nothing to do with her days (she was a midwife in the U.S., but cannot yet practice in France) and begins researching her family history. In nearly every other chapter we read of Isabella, who lived 400 years earlier. She is beginning her adult life with a marriage and child on the way. Forced to give up her beliefs in the Catholic church and the Virgin Mary as well as her skill in midwifery, she lives with her husband's family, the Tourniers.

Sepertinya Tracy menggunakan wanita sebagai tokoh sentral dalam karya-karyanya. Membaca buku ini, kita dibawa kembali ke alam-alam pedesaan dan pertanian Prancis pada awal abad 16. Sepertinya tidak seru bila tidak didahului dengan konteks historis.Latar BelakangSebuah gerakan yang awalnya mengkritisi kebijakan gereja (katolik Roma). Seorang bernama Martin Luther memulai gerakan itu di Jerman pada tahun 1517. Pokok-pokok yang dipertanyakannya adalah mengenai remisi atas dosa yang dapat diperjualbelikan serta tidak diperbolehkannya menerjemahkan Alkitab dari bahasa latin ke bahasa lainnya. Hal itu dinilai tidak fair, manakala tidak semua orang (terutama orang awam) mengerti bahasa latin. Gerakan ini dinamakan dengan nama Reformasi. Karena gerakan memprotes kebijakan gereja (katolik) itulah maka aelanjutnya Luther dan pengikutnya dinamakan Protestant.Raja Henry VIII\u00a0dari Inggris pertama kali tidak setuju dengan gerakan Luther. Ia khawatir dengan bahwa bila orang akan 'menyerang' gereja maka suatu saat akan menyerang monarki. Namun ia berubah pikiran ketika Pope Clement VII-Pemimpin tertinggi gereja Katolik di Roma- menolak membatalkan pernikahannya dengan Catherine of Aragon. Sebelumnya Catherine telah menikah dengan saudara Henry VII yaitu Raja Arthur. Namun pernikahan Catherine dan Raja Arthur hanya lima bulan, sebab Raja Arthur meninggal dunia dan kemudian Catherine menikah dengan saudaranya, Henry VIII. Pada dasarnya Henry VIII ingin mempertahankan dinasti Tudor, dengan mencari keturunan laki-laki. Pernikahannya dengan Catherine mendapatkan seorang putri. Akhirnya, Henry VIII memutuskan memisahkan gereja Inggris dengan Gereja Katolik Roma, dan pada tahun 1534 ia mengangkat dirinya sendiri sebagai pemimpin tertinggi gereja sekaligus pemimpin tertinggi negara. Henry VIII akhirnya membolehkan Alkitab bahasa Ibrani untuk diterjemahkan dalam bahasa Inggris dan digunakan di seluruh gereja di Inggris. \nNicolas Tournier yang disebut-sebut dalam Novel ini, tidak ada hubungannya dengan Ella Tournier. Ia disebut Tracy sehubungan dengan lukisan \"Entobment\"Lukisan ini dibuat pada awal abad 17, yang dikenal sebagai zaman Baroque. Zaman Baroque dikenal juga dengan abad Renaissance atau abad pencerahan. Lukisan pada zaman baroque memiliki karakter drama besar (seperti kisah di Alkitab), menggunakan warna yang kaya dan dalam, dan memiliki bayangan gelap maupun cahaya yang kuat.Yang menjadi sorotan utama Tracy pada lukisan ini adalah kain warna biru yang dikenakan Perawan Maria. Warna itu yang selalu dilihatnya dalam mimpi buruk Ella Tournier. Perjumpaan Empat AbadTracy menggunakan tokoh Ella Tournier dan Isabelle du Muolin yang dihubungkan oleh sebuah peristiwa tragis. Dari abad 16, diceritakan mengenai keluarga-keluarga yang tinggal di daerah pertanian Prancis Selatan yang dinamakan Huguenots. Istilah itu diberikan oleh pengikut Calvin, yaitu orang-orang yang mengikuti gerakan reformasinya Martin Luther di wilayah Prancis. Itu terjadi kira-kira tahun 1560 hingga 1629. Raja Charles IX dari Prancis ibunya, Catherine de M\u00e9dicis, mengkhawatirkan pertumbuhan dari Huguenots yang dipimpin oleh Gaspard de Coligny (16 February 1519 \u2013 24 August 1572). Kekhawatiran itu semakin bertambah ketika putri Catherine, Margaret of Valois menikah dengan Henry IV pada 18 August 1572. Henry III adalah dari Protestant, dan pernikahan itu pasti akan membuat pengaruh Huguenot di Prancis semakin kuat. Charles diperintah ibunya untuk membunuh para pemimpin Huguenot. Pembunuhan massal Huguenot tersebut dikenal dengan Massacre of Saint Bartholomew\u2019s Day. Dinamakan dengan istilah Saint Bartholomeuw Days, karena gereja Katolik untuk memberi penghormatan khusus pada orang-orang suci seperti\u00a0Saint Bartholomeuw yang jatuh setiap tanggal 24 Agustus. Gaspard de Coligny adalah pemimpin Huguenot yang pertama kali dibunuh pada tanggal 24 Agustus 1572.\u00a0Akhirnya bukan hanya pemimpin Huguenot, namun Huguenot itu sendiri dikejar dan dibunuh. Bukan hanya di ibukota negara, namun pembunuhan tersebut menyebar ke seluruh Prancis dan hal itulah memicu kembali Perang antara Katolik Prancis dan Protestant (Huguenot) yang sebelumnya sudah menyepakati perdamaian yang tertuang dalam Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Perjanjian perdamaian itu sendiri ditandatangani oleh Charles IX dan Gaspard de Coligny pada tahun 1570.\nLukisan Fran\u00e7ois Dubois (1529\u20131584) \"\nLe massacre de la Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy\"\u00a0\nDubois adalah saksi mata peristiwa iniSetelah lebih 30 tahun pertikaian antara Huguenot dan Katolik, akhirnya pada tahun 1598 dikeluarkan Dekrit Nantes yang dikeluarkan oleh Raja Henry IV (13 December 1553 \u2013 14 May 1610). Isi dekrit itu antara lain mengakui persamaan hak dan kemerdekaan antara Huguenot dan Katolik dalam hak-hak warganegara. Dekrit itu juga memisahkan antara Agama dan politik kenegaraan dan membolehkan unsur-unsur sekuler masuk dalam kehidupan bernegara. Ketika terjadi pembunuhan massal Huguenot, Henry IV dilindungi oleh istrinya, Margaret. Henry IV sendiri, pada tahun 1598 'berpindah' dari Protestan ke Katolik, karena Raja yang diakui di Prancis adalah Katolik.Dan dari pihak gereja katolik, menganulir pernikahan Henry IV dan Margaret yang dilakukan pada tahun 1572 yang lalu. Namun, kelak dekrit ini ditolak oleh cucu Henry IV, yaitu Louis XIV. Pada tahun 1685, Louis XIV mengeluarkan Dekrit Fontainebleau yang menyatakan bahwa Protestantism adalah illegal . Hal itu membuat 400,000 Huguenot meninggalkan Prancis, pindah Inggris, Prussia, Belanda, Switzerland, dan Afrika Selatan. Ella Tournier mewakili dari abad 20, sedangkan Isabelle du Muolin mewakili dari abad 17. Kedua wanita ini diceritakan oleh Tracy yaitu \u00a0memiliki profesi yang sama: bidan, memiliki rambut merah, seorang istri, dan menjalin hubungan dengan seorang pria idaman selain suami mereka. Selain itu, Tracy membuat kesamaan mereka dalam hal perpindahan tempat tinggal. Ella, tadinya bertempat tinggal di San Fransisco, ia melakukan profesinya dengan senang, namun karena ia mengikuti kepindahan Rick, suaminya yang berprofesi sebagai seorang arsitek ke Prancis, ia pun meninggalkan pekerjaannya dan belajar bahasa Prancis dengan Maddame Sentier. Ayah Ella menyarankannya agar menghubungi saudara dari keluarga mereka yang tinggal di Moutier, sebuah kota kecil di barat laut Swiss.Isabelle de Muolin terbiasa membantu persalinan ibu-ibu di desanya. Suatu kali ia membantu persalinan kakaknya Marie, namun sayang Marie dan anaknya tidak tertolong. Dan ketika Isabelle mengandung anak ketiga, ia berharap anaknya perempuan-setelah Petite Jean dan Jacob- dan ternyata, ia diberikan anak perempuan dan diberi nama seperti kakaknya, Marie. Sejak menikah dengan Ettiene Tournier, Isabelle ikut dengan keluarga suaminya. Ia merasakan 'penolakan' dari mertuanya, terutama ibu mertuanya, Hannah. Yang pertama karena Isabelle berasal dari keluarga yang miskin dan kedua, karena Isabelle memiliki rambut merah. Kain Biru dan Rambut MerahPada abad pertengahan, lukisan yang menggambarkan Perawan Maria, diambil dari warna biru yang dimiliki oleh batu perhiasan yang dinamakan Lapis Lazuli. Lapis Lazuli ini lebih bernilai dari emas dan ditambang di daerah yang kita kenal sekarang Afganistan. Lapis, berasal dari bahasa Latin yang berarti batu. Lazuli, berasal dari bahasa Latin lazulu turunan dari bahasa Arab, \"lazaward\", bahasa Persia, \"lazhward\" yang berarti biru atau sorga. Batu ini sudah lama menjadi hiasan kalung dan perhiasan sejak abad prasejarah. Pelukis seperti Fra Angelico menggunakan bubuk batu ini sebagai pewarna biru yang disebut \"Ultramarine\" pada jubah Maria pada lukisan di bawah ini.\nJudul: The Flight into Egypt (c.1450)Mengapa biru?1. menurut artikel di sini, orang mesir kuno menggunakan lapiz lazuli (yang berwarna biru) sebagai representasi sorga.2. menurut artikel di sini karena pada abad pertengahan, warna biru adalah warna asli Byzantium dan menggambarkan warna seorang permaisuri. Mary dianggap sebagai permaisuri sorga.\n'St Mary Magdalene' oleh: Piero di CosimoMengapa merah?ada konotasi negatif dengan warna merah pada abad pertengahan. Warna merah dianggap warna yang berhubungan dengan iblis, kejahatan. Dari sumber ini diketahui:1. dalam mitos Jerman, Dewa Thor (nama lainnya: \u00c1sa-Th\u00f3r, Donar, Donner, Th\u00f3r, Thunder, Tor) memiliki rambut merah2. Wotan, ayah Thor, memiliki mata dan janggut berwarna merah.3. Wanita berambut merah dianggap bereputasi jelek karena diasosiasikan wanita penyihir.4. Pepatah Eropa kuno yang mendiskriminasikan orang yang berambut merah dan berjanggut merah: \"Red hair, evil hair\" and \"Red beard - devil\u2019s way\".Entah prasangka darimana bahwa yang berambut dan berjenggot merah diliputi kuasa jahat. Ada sedikit penjelasan-walaupun tidak berdasar- bahwa di abad pertengahan visualisasi Yudas, salah satu murid Yesus yang mengkhianatinya, dalam lukisan, berambut merah. Selain itu, St Mary Magdalene digambarkan sebagai wanita pendosa datang kepada Yesus, juga berambut merah. Dari sebuah artikel, beginilah gambaran pada orang yang berambut merah pada abad pertengahan:\n\"false, dangerous, tricky, shameless, over-sexed, deceitful, hot-tempered, unfaithful, foolish, war-like, crude, vulgar, low-class and unlucky for those who meet them\"\nMitos dan PengetahuanDari cerita yang dituliskan oleh Tracy, kita dapat membandingkan bagaimana kehidupan pada awal abad renaissance serta kehidupan di abad saat ini. Pada cerita Isabelle, semuanya serba terikat dengan tradisi dan mitos. Ia adalah 'korban' tradisi tersebut. Ia seperti tidak punya posisi tawar dengan apa yang dilakukan orang-orang yang mengolok-oloknya dengan kata La Rousse. Di keluarganya pun, Isabelle seperti tidak diperhitungkan. Ibunya meninggal karena infeksi gigitan serigala, dan ia satu-satunya perempuan di rumah, namun ayahnya lebih mempercayai saudara laki-lakinya mengurus pertanian. Isabelle juga difitnah karena seorang anak yang terkena kaca patri. Padahal kaca itu sendiri pecah karena terkena lemparan orang. Isabelle juga menerima perlakuan tidak senonoh dari Etiene Tournier yang kelak menjadi suaminya. Dan yang lebih miris, Isabelle tidak mendapatkan pembelaan dari Etiene, sebab sesungguhnya Etiene tidak mencintai Isabelle. Demikian juga ayah Isabelle, ia tidak menyetujui Etiene menjadi menantunya. Ayahnya tidak suka dengan keluarga Tournier. Perlakuan yang manis hanya diperoleh Isabelle dari Susanne, iparnya. Mungkin hanya Susanne yang waras tidak mempercayai mitos rambut merah Isabelle.\nalun-alun Lisle-sur-TarnPada cerita Ella Tournier, ia adalah seorang wanita yang berpendidikan dan mandiri. Ia tidak tinggal diam di rumah manakala suaminya bekerja. Ella menggambarkan suasana alun-alun Lisle-sur-Tarn seperti kota impiannya. Empat penjuru alun-alun yang dikelilingi ruko di sepanjang jalan serta sebuah air mancur di tengah-tengah alun-alun tersebut. Ia juga mengikuti kelas Bahasa Prancis bersama Madame Sentier. Ia juga berkenalan dengan seorang pustakawan yang bernama Jean-Paul yang ternyata belajar ilmu kepustakaan di Columbia University. Perkenalan dengan pustakawan tersebut membawa keuntungan bagi Ella, sebab Jean-Paul banyak mengetahui sejarah dan memiliki jejaring perpustakaan di daerah Prancis. Ella juga diberi kebebasan oleh Rick untuk melakukan perjalanan sendiri mencari kerabatnya di Moutier.Di Moutier, bertemu kisah Isabelle dan Ella. Ella merasakan perbedaan penataan kota antara di\u00a0Lisle-sur-Tarn dengan di Moutier. di Lisle-sur-Tarn lebih tertata rapi dibanding Moutier, namun orang Swiss (Moutier) lebih ramah dari pada orang Prancis (Lisle-sur-Tarn).\u00a0Bertemunya Ella dengan saudaranya, Jacob Tournier membawa pada silsilah keluarga Tournier. Ella dibawa ke rumah pertanian milik leluhur. Dan disitulah mimpi-mimpi buruknya terjawab.Terlepas dari kisah nyata dan fiksi yang diramu oleh Tracy dalam buku ini. Ada beberapa hal yang menjadi catatan saya ketika membaca dan menelaah kisah The Virgin Blue ini. Pertama, munculnya perubahan mendasar dalam kehidupan beragama dan politik memiliki dampak yang sangat luas. Mungkin sejarah akan bercerita dari sisi puncaknya saja, namun di tingkat rakyat bawah, perubahan tersebut sering kali tidak berpihak pada yang lemah. Kedua, pendidikan dan pengetahuan adalah peluang untuk membasmi kekerdilan berpikir. Pada akhir abad pertengahan, perempuan tidak diberikan wadah untuk sebagai mitra pengambil keputusan (kecuali ratu). Padahal, ia juga seorang manusia yang juga memberi kontribusi yang tidak kalah banyak dengan laki-laki. Selain itu, pada masa itu perempuan sering menjadi 'korban' mitos yang menyudutkan mereka. Dan mampukah (agama) membela mereka? sampai sekarang masih ditemukan perempuan yang tidak dibela hak-haknya. Ketiga, masing-masing orang memiliki spiritualitas yang berbeda, kita tidak perlu mengganggu apalagi menghakimi. Dalam sejarah seringkali yang digunakan adalah pendekatan kekuasaan bila ditemukan adanya perbedaan keyakinan.Pesan dari Isabelle, sebuah kerinduan akan pada tempat masa lalu yang penuh dengan kelimpahan. Kita baru dapat mengerti sesuatu sangat berharga saat kita temukan bahwa kita sangat sulit memperolehnya kembali.Ketika kita memiliki segalanya, kita menganggapnya biasa-biasa saja. Seperti air. Kita tidak berpikir tentang air sampai merasa haus dan tidak ada air.

Or possibly two sides of the same story. In one story, set in modern day, American Ella Turner is a midwife studying for re-licensing after relocating with her husband to France. She investigates her ancestral roots for something to do and becomes intrigued in both her family history and the local librarian, Jean-Paul. The other story is that of Isabelle du Moulin, a French Protestant woman who marries into the Tournier family and who escapes persecution by the Catholics by fleeing into Switzerland. The stories of Ella and Isabelle run in parallel and it's not hard to see that Isabelle is a proxy for Ella or vice versa, what with Ella's hair turning red as Isabelle's does, both of them being midwives, and both being married to less than ideal husbands. There's a \"wolfish\" love interest in both stories too (the double-quotes are for the grimace that accompanies the word). I read the book in one sitting and found it to be highly satisfying, in the way that well-written, entertaining detective fiction is, even if you can see the ending from a way off. I suppose it's inevitable that I compare this book with Chevalier's more well-known Girl with a Pearl Earring. I enjoyed this one more because of a clearer structure and quicker pace. On the other hand, I can also spot a fatal flaw in trying to make the ending too clear, in making the narrator of one story the author of the other. It ruins that lovely sense of distance that's created in Isabelle's story and the effect of having the two stories exist simultaneously in time. I'd like very much to cut the Epilogue out of every edition and have the uneasy thought of Isabelle's ending jar in the reader's mind with the happy satisfaction of Ella's story."}, {"userName": "Elena T.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39086536-elena-t", "userReview": "XVI secolo, in Francia: tutto il villaggio conosce Isabelle du Moulin come La Rossa, una ragazza dai capelli color rame, ma l'arrivo dei calvinisti \u2013 adepti al fanatismo della Riforma- renderanno il nomignolo di Isabelle sinonimo di stregoneria.

Part of the story was of Isabelle, a 15th century woman who was \"cursed\" with having red hair - the same color of hair as the Virgin Mary was portrayed as having. The time period was about the time when the Huguenots were being chased out of France into Sweden. The other part of the story is about Ella, a modern day woman who is researching the mystery behind her family ancestry after a move to France.In essence, this is partly a historical tale and partly a mystery.I loved the historical story. It was fascinating to read Isabella's story and I loved that the author focused so intensely on the characters. The bits of historical detail were interesting but not so much that I felt as if I were reading a text book. This part of the story really came to life for me.The modern day story (aside from the mystery/research angle) was a bit cliche. There were times I felt a connection with Ella and times when I just wanted to smack her around. Also there was this weird mysticism thing going on that was just..strange, and things feel into place for Ella way too easily. If you read the book, you'll understand what I'm talking about.My neighbor gave me this book to read and I'll be happy to tell her I enjoyed it, I really did. I read it in an evening - so it's definitely an interesting read.

The overlapping stories are fascinating, exciting, and propel a sense of reality that sometimes other fiction can not accomplish. I believe that Tracy Chevalier is a talented writer (story teller) because of her characters, subjects, and environments, in which she places those characters. After watching a short video with her being interviewed about her newest book, \"Remarkable Creatures,\" I realize how her creative mind works and what inspires her. She is very attentive to details and lets them fester before initiating her whole story. She may have lots of ideas for a story, but then they all meld together to make something wonderful, like this book. I wanted to go to Poland after reading this book and research/search about my Polish family history - like Ella does in France, in this story. The results of Ella's search seem very lucky and satisfying, which I like in stories of this nature. I'm starting to realize that Chevalier is possibly one of my favorites writers. This is the second book of hers that I've read; I've got more to read. The first of course was \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" which I also gave four stars.

Let me just say that I loved, loved, LOVED this novel! I couldn't bear to put it down and so I read it practically straight through in a matter of hours.Chevalier's description of the people and towns of France both in present day and in the past are amazingly full of life and incredibly beautiful. It was impossible not to fall in love with France while reading The Virgin Blue. The author's love both for history and art is easy to see and infectious - I am eager to read her other novels as soon as I can get my hands on them.The characters are well-written and and believable and the plot is quick-moving and engrossing. The Virgin Blue is possibly the best book that I've read this year.

Her books, Girl with a Pearl Earring and Falling Angels were terrific. This book was good and I did finish it, but it fell short compared to her others. I enjoyed the story of Isabelle du Moulin more so than Ella Turner's story. Isabelle is a tragic heroine and I wanted to learn more about her and her situation. Ella's story, while less tragic certainly, entertained me but did not grasp me. I felt distant from her somehow. I think she created her own problems and then looked for others to solve them. I would have preferred a better ending as well. I still felt at a bit of a loss as to Isabelle's life and her subsequent demise.

All the family's beliefs are challenged, especially as Isabelle's sister and then her mother die. Her brothers leave to fight in a war, never to return. She tells her father that she will marry and she and her husband will live with him and help with the farm, but the man that she marries, Etienne, is from a family that her father hates. Soon the Reformation comes to their community and they are forced to flee for their lives. Four hundred years later, Ella Turner travels to France and moves into a small town with her husband, Rick. Ella is at first enthusiastic about the town but she is surprised at behavior of its citizens and so, while brushing up on her French with hopes of becoming a midwife, she is soon involved in looking into her family history. Two women both facing challenges of culture, perception and belief. As Chevalier weaves their two stories together, it creates a full, rich tale of a family history. While I found it interesting how different these women are, they both seek a place of their own, a feeling of safety and sureness.

It uses the same concept of alternating a historical plot with present day events, and both modern heroines are facing similar issues.The modern story follows Ella, a woman with French ancestry who moves to France because of her husband's work. They decide to live in a small French town and Ella gets involved with a local librarian while researching her geneology. The \"flashback\" sequences follow Isabelle, who has married into a Calvinist family who does not completely accept her because of her red hair, profession as a midwife (Ella is also a midwife), and her loyalty to the virgin Mary (Calvinists were strictly opposed to any vestiges of Catholic \"intermediary\" saints, especially Mary).The Virgin Blue starts out with fairly long chapters clearly separated into medieval and current time periods, but at the denoument the events are blended together in a rapid succession that was a little disorienting, but suited the narrative, since the events themselves were confused.There were some hints at the supernatural in the form of mysterious connections between Ella and other female descendents of Isabelle that were never fully explored.

Now, after a while, I think this concept might get a bit formulaic and redundant. In this book, I can see that she is actively trying to avoid just such a situation. Rather than imagining how the portrait came to be, as in \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\", Chevalier instead concentrates solely on the girl in the portrait and tries to imagine her life. The pacing of the book was a bit faster than \"Pearl Earring,\" in my opinion a good thing for the plot, but the book crescendoed too late. The reader already figured out the resolution, but the author tried to keep the tension going an extra 10 pages or so, which didn't really work for me. Additionally, I'm just not a big fan of using pastlife experiences as a major plot mover. It simply seems like a cheap way to pull disparate plot lines together rather than using talent to weave them into a coherent plot.
