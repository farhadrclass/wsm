After thanking me she asked me what it was about. I told her it's about a boy and his dog. She asked me if the dog dies. I told her he does, but that it is still a good book. She asked if I had read it. I told her I hadn't - only seen the movie. She asked me to read it for her first to make sure it wasn't too sad. She's on to me...Our 14 year-old protagonist Travis comes of age when his father leaves him to be the man of the house while he does a cattle drive from Texas to Kansas. Gipson's frontiersy narrative and dialogue feels right, sounds right, for a book written for children in the 1950s about life in West Texas in the late 1860s. My memories of the movie are hazy, but it seems that the film action follows closely to the written word action, and while there is definitely sadness in the passing of Old Yeller, it doesn't feel like maudlin melancholy. As an eight year old it is the kind of book I would want to read about such weighty subjects as death, grieving, living. When I finished reading it, I handed the novel to my daughter and said, \"It's not so sad. You'll like it.\" She's read the entire Laura Ingalls Wilder series. This book is a layup.When traveling my daughter often sees me reading on a Kindle or an iPad. She knows I am reading a book - she also knows that I prefer to read a physical copy rather than an E but that our luggage can only accommodate so many books (here in Florida I've been walking around with Women and Men like a KJV Bible clutched heavily to my chest). She asks when she will be able to read a book on the iPad; I know that in her lifetime a library will be as much of an anachronism as if I had a shelf of VHS tapes - but I want to hold out for as long as I can and help her to experience the tactile enjoyment of the tree book over the ebook. This paperback copy of Old Yeller is 60 years old, in decent shape and is only just showing the ravages of time with yellowing paper and crackling spine glue. While reading the book I hand it to my daughter and ask her to flip the pages under her nose and breath in. She does so, smiles. \"You'll never get that from an ebook\", I tell her. I hope she remembers this."}, {"userName": "Lynne King", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15736557-lynne-king", "userReview": "\u201cNow Travis,\u2019 he said, \u201cyou\u2019re getting to be a big boy, and while I\u2019m gone, you\u2019ll be the man of the family. I want you to act like one. You take care of mama and Little Arliss. You look after the work and don\u2019t wait around for your mama to point out what needs to be done. Think you can do that?\u201d\u201cYessir,\u201d I said.His father had to go away to get some \u201ccash money\u201d by selling his steer. But the boy wanted a horse. The upshot being that if he acted as a man when his father was away, he would be rewarded with his wish upon his father\u2019s return.And on that note his father left with the other steer herders and they went off to the cattle market in Kansas to return in the fall.I acquired this book on another whim. I wanted something \u201clight\u201d to read and I read an excellent review by Jim on Goodreads, so decided this was the book for me and a quick, light read too. How surprised I was when I started reading it and found out what a gem, well in fact it\u2019s more of a gem, it\u2019s a diamond and I absolutely loved it!Here we are in Texas in the late 1860s, to find the settlers who indeed had their work cut out for them in order to survive and bring up their families. I\u2019m terrified of snakes here in France but to think of the wide selection of animals that could be found there on an everyday basis: bobcats, bears, wolves, panthers, rattlers, hogs, coons, etc. plus the odd raiding Indians. I\u2019m not at all surprised that the settlers would naturally have dogs as guard dogs if nothing else. I believe that I would have either stayed indoors all the time, playing the helpless female or look for a good man who wanted to settle in safer climes. But still in the 1860s, I would imagine that a woman\u2019s lot was a hard one and she had very little choice in life; certainly nothing like the 21st century career women with choices galore if they want to take advantage of it.The more I read about fourteen year old Travis\u2019 family, mama and papa, of course, and five year-old Arliss (known as Little Arliss and what a terror he was, constantly causing problems), the more I became engrossed in this exciting, poignant, adventurous and yet magical book. There was the constant thrill of their life be it with an element of death living around the corner, living in a log cabin that the parents had built in a place that they named Birdsong CreekWhen Travis loses his beloved dog Bell in a rather nasty way, he swears he\u2019ll never have another one, even though his father said that it essential for the safety of their daily lives. I know how he felt. When I lost my five year old black Labrador Jasper to a dreadful end, I also swore, no, I\u2019ll never, ever have another dog. That emotional pain and the memories I would never consider again. I can equate this to childbirth. My mother told my father after the birth of my elder brother, no more children, one\u2019s enough but still she went on to have three more children. So Travis although not wanting another dog, unsuspectingly does end up with one, and serendipitously too when one morning he finds Little Arliss playing with this ugly dog in their drinking water. Travis is furious and remembers his father telling him, when he loses Bell, to get another dog and Travis is adamant in that he won\u2019t have it. Nevertheless, his mother is clever, for when his father is away at the cattle market, 600 miles away, with Travis ostensibly in charge (albeit under her watchful eye), she persuades him to let Little Arliss have the dog for company as he will be alone so much as she and Travis will be too busy to play with him. So Travis begrudgingly agrees and slowly begins to love Old Yeller and what a blessing this dog turned out to be. I actually had a lump in my throat from time to time as I continued reading this book.\u201cWe called him Old Yeller. The name had a sort of double meaning. One part meant that his short hair was a dingy yellow, a color that we called \u201cyeller\u201d in those days. The other meant that when he opened his head (a strange turn of phase); the sound he let out came closer to being a yell than a bark.\u201dWe live through the \u201ctrials and tribulations\u201d of the family and Old Yeller surviving involvements with bears and hogs, and some of those sections were quite gruesome.I was amused when I saw that the family ate squirrel because they used to do that here about fifty years ago. I live here in France in \u201crusticana\u201d, about forty miles from a city and this is a land of hunters and fishermen, so I could truly relate to this book.Also the medicinal aspects were interesting, for example, in that when the mother used poultices for wounds she prepared \u201cmashed-up prickly-pear root to draw out the poison\u201d and also horse\u2019s hair for stitching up wounds as it was ostensibly the best.Lisbeth, who came to help out the family latterly when Travis gets involved in an accident, is a strange girl but she turns out well in the end and as for Old Yeller, what a fabulous find he turned out to be; saving the family on various occasions from some possibly very unfortunate outcomes. I could just continue in this vein. The truly sad part is when hydrophobia (rabies I guess) strikes and does the family suffer in that regard.I initially thought that Old Yeller was the catalyst in this book but it is indeed the horse as Travis, through sheer hard work, progresses through the early stages of manhood. The horse will be his ultimate reward when he has proved himself to be a man. The ultimate test for this incredible young man and was I impressed.This is an excellent read for all ages. I have the Kindle version and I\u2019m now going to order a hardback copy so that I can browse through it, as will be my want from time to time.This is an absolutely super read and my only regret is that I would have loved to have read it as a child."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "Let me say first that some love this book and to be fair I never read it except to get an idea of the story. You will find in my books low ratings for Black Beauty, The Yearling, Old Yeller and any books that have the \"pain of life motif\" in common. By the way this includes Cold Mountain. Look up my review and you'll see I try to give recognition that it's well written but just not a book I can like. And these ratings are how I feel and what I think of these books. Some will say how they love these books and how possibly there was just no other way to \"realistically\" end the story. I grew up in the Smokies and without going over my childhood, I had 2 dogs killed...shot. I've lived through the loss of beloved animals, beloved people and beloved relationships...I don't need a novel that leads me through \"what pain is\". If a book is of the \"life is tough and then you die school\", it's going to get a \"down check\" from me. While fiction does instruct, there are some lessons I learned from life, I don't need to have them rehashed in leisure time activities.This book/movie (I know but in this case I'll lump them together) scarred me and I suspect other young people. Ask anyone who has loved a dog (an animal) if the fact that you get a \"new puppy\" after you had to kill the dog makes up for it. Maybe this book is well written. I sometimes suspect that many if not most of the people who come to \"love\" books like this maybe haven't gone through that pain in life. If you have and you still love this work, well, good. I can not say that."}, {"userName": "Calista", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16731747-calista", "userReview": "Amazing! There is a reason this book is such a classic. I cried at the end. What a dog that Yeller. A frontier family survive with the help of this scoundrel dog. This book is so grounded and down to earth. They had a lot of ingenuity living on the land as they did. I appreciated how Fred handled the emotions of the characters. Everything and everyone felt so real. I felt like they were living and breathing. Travis's emotional arch is touching. This is a work of art, it really is. I'm so glad I gave this a go.

Forgive my presumptuousness, but please don't let my lack of experience stop you from reading. Here's the story of Old Yeller: Daddy, Mama, young son, and early teenage son live as a family on the Texas frontier. To provide for the family, Daddy has to go on a cattle drive to Kansas. Before he leaves, Daddy takes the oldest son aside and tells him he is going to have to be the man of the house since Daddy will be gone the next few months.When you get to this anachronistic charge, you may be tempted to throw the book down and dismiss the entire book as patriarchal and condescending. If you have sons, keep reading. You might even consider having your sons read this book. In truth, Old Yeller is the timeless story of the journey a boy goes through to become a man. I get tired of encountering men who don't know what it means to be a man, who don't speak the truth, who don't keep their word, who show no respect, who look for the easy way out, who show no backbone, and have few principles. In short, men who refuse to accept responsibility. I suspect these men have been shielded from hard and unpleasant tasks, and by being so protected, they fail to learn to do the right thing, regardless of its difficulty.I have seen Old Yeller on film two or three times and had read the book in years past multiple times. I thought I was ready. I really did.Last Sunday, I put my faithful dog to sleep.It was the right and merciful thing to do.It still broke my heart."}, {"userName": "Book Concierge", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge", "userReview": "Gipson\u2019s simply told tale of a boy and his dog living in the Texas Hill Country of 1860 is a genuine classic of children\u2019s literature. Travis Coates is only 14 years old, but while his father is off for months on a cattle drive, he is the \u201cman of the house,\u201d left on the homestead with his mother and younger brother, 5-year-old Arliss. A stray yellow mutt of a dog, with one ear virtually chewed off, and only a stump of a tail, shows up one day. He\u2019s a no good, thieving rascal \u2013 taking their meat and stealing eggs when he can \u2013 but he proves himself to be a key defender of the family when he faces a bear that is targeting Arliss. Just as Old Yeller worms his way into the family\u2019s hearts, this book will burrow into the reader\u2019s heart. I am not a \u201cdog person,\u201d but I really connected with this book. I think this in part due to the fact that I grew up in the Texas Hill Country, so the scenery was alive in my imagination. But more importantly, I connected to the way Gipson portrayed the characters\u2019 emotions \u2013 fear, love, irritation, loyalty, happiness, sorrow. This little book packs a big wallop."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "I'm so glad I listened to this again. Fantastic narrator, perfect voice for the part.I thought I remembered the book well, but I hadn't, not really. Too many years & too mixed up from seeing the movie, which changes some things. Super movie, but nothing beats the book.Gipson perfectly captured a mature 14 year old, the kind of boy I'd expect given the times, post Civil War Texas, late 1860's. He wasn't always perfect, but that just made him more real. The feelings he had were very well done as were the descriptions of life at the time. What a hard life they had. Makes me glad to live now.I won't even bother saying anything about that old yeller dog. Everyone knows. I will say the book handles the end better than the movie, IMO. Yes, it's sad, but so realistic & fantastic in its own way.If you haven't read this in sometime, I can't recommend a reread highly enough.

This book covered so many of the topics and themes of Georgics, I was surprised. This book talked a lot about the cycle of birth/death. This cycle is almost foreign to us anymore, and I believe that that isn't a good thing. Because death is such a mysterious thing, it tends to be shocking for us, and I'm quite certain that God never intended it to be so. One of my favorite quotes from the book is when Travis is talking with his dad about his feelings after Yeller's death. His dad says, \"Now the thing to do,\"he went on, \"is to try to forget it and go on being a man.\"\"How?\" I asked. \"How can you forget a thing like that?\"He studied me for a moment, then shook his head. \"I guess I don't quite mean that,\" he said. \"It's not a thing you can forget. I don't guess it's a thing that you ought to forget. What I mean is, things like that happen. They may seem might cruel and unfair, but that's how life is a part of the time. But that isn't the only way life is. A part of the time, it's mighty good. And a man can't afford to waste all the good part, worrying about the bad parts. That makes it all bad.\"Another point made in the book that I really liked was about man's dependence on the land. This is something I think we have totally lost in our society, for sure to our detriment. Two quotes I liked about this were when the father was leaving. He said to his son, \"Now, there're the cows to milk and wood to cut and young pigs to mark and fresh meat to shoot. But mainly there's the corn patch. If you don't work it right or if you let the varmints eat up the roasting ears, we'll be without bread corn for the winter.\" After the father left, Travis says, \"Now it was home, too. And while Papa was gone it was up to me to look after it.\" How many of us understand how important that really is?"}, {"userName": "Whitney", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1690016-whitney", "userReview": "This is a very good and really sad book i was crying at the end.

When I was about 9 years old, we decided to read Old Yeller together. I cannot remember why we chose the book, but I believe it was new to both of us. It was a special time for me, as I had my mom all to myself in a busy house, and we both really enjoyed the story, characters, and the writing. I remember the ending, and I won't spoil it for those who may not be familiar with the tale. What I will say, is that Old Yeller, was the first book that taught me as a youth, in a deep and powerful way, how strong the written word can be. I remember being almost shocked that I could feel such immense empathy for characters who I knew logically were not real. Even after all these years, I still have very strong feelings about this book. I will always love this book, and I hope many others will love it as well.I came across this quote recently which when I read it, I immediately thought of Old Yeller.\u201cOnce, in my father\u2019s bookshop, I heard a regular customer say that few things leave a deeper mark on a reader than the first book that finds its way into his heart.

Farm chores were a given. Then comes a mangy, ratty dog who steals eggs and such from them. He sees Arliss with the mutt at the trough. His mother suggests that the little boy will need a companion to play with, to keep Arliss company while she and Travis are working the farm. \u201cWe called him Old Yeller. The name had a sort of double meaning. One part meant that his short hair was a dingy yellow, a color that we called \u201cyeller\u201d in those days. The other meant that when he opened his head (a strange turn of phase); the sound he let out came closer to being a yell than a bark.Old Yeller slowly becomes part of their lives and saves the family in many situations, but alas Travis cannot save his precious buddy; he is the one who had to shoot Old Yeller.Gipson accurately describes 1860s Texas and weaves a great story about relationships, love, and loss."}, {"userName": "Richard Knight", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8663519-richard-knight", "userReview": "I must be a dog mood.

When his father goes on a trip leaving him to \"act a man's part,\" he throws himself into his new responsibilities. But the challenges of feeding and protecting his family prove to be greater than his boy's abilities, and he comes to depend on and love the stray dog which adopts their family.The story follows chapter after chapter of gritty, riveting and often funny adventures as the family wrestles out a living from the land, dealing with angry bulls, thieving coons, an enraged bear, vicious javelinas, and an outbreak of \"hydrophobia\" (rabies). Through these challenges, Travis grows to fill his father's shoes while Yeller makes himself indispensible, saving the family member's lives time upon time. In the culmination of the story, Yeller is bitten while fighting off a rabies-infected wolf that had attacked Travis's mother. Realizing the bite of the wolf is fatal, and that Yeller will become a danger to the family before he dies, Travis kills him.It is important to note that Travis is not forced to kill his beloved dog. He is quick to see that Yeller has been infected with rabies, and (unlike Jody in The Yearling) he does not deny that his dog is a danger to the family. Although he loves Yeller, he knows his responsibility is first toward his mother and brother. Although his mother offers to do it for him, he quickly and resolutely pays the price to protect his family. This self-sacrifice is exactly the kind of character quality our children ought to see as normal, and Travis's decision grows out of the his emerging character. It is an extraordinary act of moral courage, but it comes at the end of a story filled with ordinary acts of responsibility. In this outstanding coming-of-age story, Travis's manhood is achieved at great cost, and in this cost he proves his worth as a man."}, {"userName": "Reid", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1235793-reid", "userReview": "I am getting old enough that it is quite possible I read this classic tale many years ago, but I sure don't remember it.

Filled with the lore of backwoods Texas in the 1860s, including a great deal of information about how they went about surviving in perilous circumstances with threats on every side from the natural world and their fellow humans.The main character, of course, is a mangy cur named Old Yeller, who comes to stay with Travis's family one day, out of the blue. Travis can't stand him at first, but comes to love Yeller with his whole heart. Every day is an adventure of some sort or another on the farm, but Travis's father has gone off on a cattle drive and Travis must be depended on to keep things running. Throughout it all, Old Yeller is companion, friend and protector to the whole family.If you have never read this sweet story, give yourself a treat and pick it up.
