The first thing I have to say is Michelle Paver (so far) seems to be naming her books very precisely. It\u2019s simple yet very apt plus it mimics the subtle intensity of the action and the prose in this book. Another very subtle event is the developing relationship between Torak and Renn as they try to navigate their growing friendship. Renn\u2019s characterization is so cool. She's becoming one of my favourite literary heroines. She proves her courage and wisdom yet again. And it\u2019s also bolstered by how Torak perceives her strength, intelligence, integrity and bravery. She's also a great balance to Torak's seemingly grimmer nature. So far, especially with each new puzzle he uncovers about his past, Torak becomes less carefree and relaxed with the new family he creates with the Ravens. In fact this book has been the darkest one so far! It becomes more apparently good versus evil here. I am reminded of reading Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. That, to me at least, was the book which really changed it from a simple school story to a very dangerous adventure. Things are definitely getting more serious as this book ends and the title of the fourth has an ominous ring, but I am perversely excited to see what else will happen to Torak."}, {"userName": "Pauline", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/967928-pauline", "userReview": "\"Soul Eater\" is the third book in \"Chronicles of Ancient Darkness\", but there will be six books in all.The story continues to follow Renn and Torak in their pursuit of the Soul Eaters, who have captured wolf; Torak's canine companion and \u2018pack brother\u2019. Wolf is to be used in a series of sacrifices to protect the Soul Eaters from the demons they are to unleash into the world.Torak and Renn pursue the Soul Eaters and try to prevent the evil they wish to release.

But......it was still bloody awesome. This series is so underrated, it's unbearable. More kids need to read this! I'm so serious. Sadly there doesn't seem to be too big of a fandom. The worldbuilding was, as usual, such an amazing part of this novel. Paver grows the world, beginning from book one and I am so immersed. I'm freaking jealous of her worldbuilding skills. The characters are all multi layered and varied. Wolf is a precious cinnamon roll, Renn is a badass, Torak is an idiot but an endearing one and Finn Kedinn is wise and smart and probably my favorite character from this series. That man better not die!! i'm warning !! you michelle!!Overall I really really really loved it and I am so excited to reread Outcast! <3333 Them Soul Eaters are freaky and I am loving these stories so much. Cuz like ancient clans?? friendships between wolves and ppl?? badass leading female MC who shoot arrows?? masterful worldbuilding??? excitement?? demons?? WHY ARE YOU NOT HITTING \"WANT TO READ\". Ya'll, go find the first book and hit that to read button faster than I can say Fin Keddinn. I'd really appreciate it! And I think you will too once you read it.

Soul Eater was a fantastic book! My favourite book in the series so far! I love the characters even more as the series goes on. Paver knew what she was doing and she does it well. I seriously feel bad for Torak. Bad things just keep happening to him. Why can\u2019t he be at peace just for a little longer? Wolf being kidnapped is one of the worst things that could have happened to him. I love his dedication to find Wolf but it also blinded him which caused him to do stupid things (like fighting with Renn). Speaking of Renn, she is quickly climbing up the ranks of my favourite female characters. I love her so much! She is just awesome. Torak would not have made it without her. Without Wolf, the interactions between the two were simply great. I love how they knew each other so well but I was also annoyed but them keeping secrets from each other. I just want them to be happy with Wolf okay? (I was so happy when Wolf referred to Renn as his and Torak\u2019s pack sister)The plot was just intense. I was scared for Wolf, Renn and Torak the whole time. We got to meet the rest of the Soul-Eaters and they were so creepy. We also got to see Torak spirit walk several times and it was amazing. Everything about this book was amazing. I loved the backstory about Michelle Paver\u2019s researching trips at the end of the book. They\u2019re so entertaining.

Demi menyelamatkan saudara sekawannya, Torak dan Renn mengejar hingga ke Utara Jauh, daerah di mana salju tidak pernah mencair. Di sana, para Pemangsa Arwah telah merencanakan tindakan keji yang akan mempengaruhi Hutan dan penghuninya.SampulGw sudah melihat-lihat beberapa versi lain dari sampul novel yang sama, dan versi Indonesia adalah yang paling tidak enak dipandang mata. Putih, gak jelas, dan jelek abis. Ini salah satu sampul novel terburuk yang pernah gw lihat, titik.PenulisanPenulisan Paver detail dan menarik seperti biasa. Sayangnya, dengan berat hati, gw harus mengatakan bahwa kualitas penerjemahan di Soul Eater payah. Ada begitu banyak kalimat yang diterjemahkan mentah-mentah tanpa memperhitungkan konteks. Hasilnya adalah kalimat-kalimat aneh yang benar-benar gak masuk akal. Bagi gw, ini sangat merusak kenikmatan gw dalam membaca Soul Eater.CeritaSoul Eater menampilkan kisah yang jauh lebih berkembang dan menggigit dibandingkan kedua pendahulunya. Intensitasnya lebih terasa karena sepanjang jalan kita dapat merasakan nyawa Serigala berada di ujung tanduk. Kesan gawat inilah yang absen di dua buku sebelumnyaBuku ini juga menjadi penanda dimulainya konflik utama dengan kelompok Pemangsa Arwah. Para tokoh antagonis tersebut memang terkesan agak klise, tapi penggambaran detail ritual dan aura shaman yang diberikan Paver memberikan keunikan tersendiri bagi mereka.Karakteristik dan hubungan Torak dan Renn pun lebih digali. Kini sedikit banyak kita tahu apa yang dirasakan masing-masing terhadap satu sama lain. Karakter Renn sendiri kini lebih dipertegas, dan kadang terasa bahwa dia unggul segala-galanya dibandingkan Torak.Tak ada yang terlalu heboh di bagian ending, tapi terasa jelas bahwa penutup cerita ini adalah awal yang sempurna bagi buku keempat. Semuanya diakhiri dengan rapi dan mampu menggali rasa penasaran terhadap apa yang akan terjadi di kisah selanjutnya.Lain-LainSeperti biasa, ada peta dunia. Selain itu juga ada biografi singkat mengenai Serigala. Bacaan yang cukup menarik dan memberikan informasi yang tak sedikit mengenai karakter dan spesies mengagumkan tersebut.KesimpulanKisah Chronicles of Ancient Darkness makin menarik seiring munculnya seri terbaru. Soul Eater makin mengukuhkan hal ini. Sayang, penerjemahan yang di bawah standar sangat mengurangi kualitas buku ini. Jika Anda mengerti bahasa Inggris, tak ada salahnya untuk membeli versi aslinya yang menawarkan sampul yang lebih baik dan tentunya cerita bagus yang tak ternodai proses penerjemahan yang kacau."}, {"userName": "Lala", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5782406-lala", "userReview": "\"We keep our dead with us till spring, said Akoomik, to save them from the foxes.

Mengetahui kebenaran memang terkadang seperti menelan pil pahit. Awalnya tak mudah bagi Torak untuk mempercayai semua hal yang dibenarkan oleh Fin- Keddin, pemimpin Klan Gagak, namun ia akhirnya sadar bawa tak mungkin menghindar. Garis nasibnya telah ditentukan. Walau hal itu berarti berhadapan dengan sekumpulan Pemangsa Arwah.Tak seorang pun menduga bahwa pertemuan torak dengan Pemangsa Arwah akan secepat itu. Suatu hari di musim dingin, saat berburu rusa, Torak dan Ren sadar bahwa Serigala menghilang. Jejak serigala menghilang begitu saja. Usaha memanggil serigala pun tak membuahkan hasil karena tak sekalipun Serigala membalas lolongan Torak. Tak butuh waktu lama untuk tahu bahwa serigala telah diculik. Apalagi ketika bertemu dengan Pejalan, pria aneh dan sedikit gila.Perjalanan mencari Serigala ternyata tak mudah. Mereka mengejar hingga ke Utara Jauh, daerah di mana salju tidak pernah mencair. Seakan tak peduli akan dingin yang menggigit dan bahaya lain yang mengintai, Torak meneruskan perjalanan untuk menyelamatkan saudara sekawannya. Bahkan ketika semua itu ditentang oleh Ren yang mengusulkan untuk kembali ke Klan Gagak dan meminta bantuan. Karena Bukan hanya masalah geografis namun yang akan di hadapai mereka berdua adalah kekuatan jahat yang dimiliki sekelompok orang yang menamai dirinya sebagai Pemangsa Arwah.Petualangan kali ini benar-benar menegangkan. Tidak hanya karena Torak akhirnya berhadapan dengan para Pemangsa Arwah namun juga karena perjalanan Torak sungguh berbahaya. Yang tak kalah penting adalah banyak fakta baru tentang Pemangsa Arwah. Siapa saja dan seperti apa rupa mereka terungkap dalam buku ini.Seperti dua buku sebelumnya, Michelle Paver selalu menyisipkan keterangan tambahan. Kali ini ia membahas segala sesuatu tentang Serigala. Karakter yang satu ini memang menjadi bagian yang tak terlepaskan dari petualangan Torak. Rasanya gemas setiap kai membaca mengenai tingkah lakunya. Apalagi saat ia sedang bercanda bersama Torak. Dari keterangan yang ditulis Michelle, sekarang Serigala jauh lebih dewasa.Dari segi terjemahan sebenarnya tak ada masalah. Hanya saja akan sedikit janggal ketika mengetahui bahwa ada perubahan istilah. Kalau mengikuti serial ini dari buku pertama tentu akan sedikit merasa aneh ketika Pemakan Arwah berubah menjadi Pemangsa Arwah. Perubahan istilah seperti ini sebenarnya tak mengusik petualangan Torak namun akan lebih baik jika kekonsistenan tetap terjaga. Ini bukan pertama kali terjadi pada buku terjemahan terbitan Matahati. Untuk buku selanjutnya, Out Cast, saya jadi penasaran istilah mana yang akan digunakan nantinya."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4552039-anna", "userReview": "'Soul Eater' takes us to the Far North as Torak and Renn venture to save Wolf. They go where not many people dare to enter, and therefore our heroes are alone for most of the book. However, it didn't tire me out. This also means that there's only Torak, Renn and Wolf to stand against Soul Eaters and a whole horde of demons. Their outstanding courage really astounded me. We got to see Torak spirit walk deliberately, and the process is not as harmless and pleasant as I thought it to be. And the fact Torak invokes it on purpose makes it even more amazing. Another thing that impressed me is the depth of bonds between Torak and Wolf. It goes so far that Torak allows Wolf to bite him, knowing he can lose a hand if the latter panics, and Wolf allows Torak to hurt him knowing Torak only wants to help him. Again, Michelle Paver created fantastic atmosphere in her book. I like the descriptions of the Far North and the amount of details of Ice Clans' life. And every time an ice bear appeared I could sense that air of magnificence, strength and wilderness. Excellent job, Michelle!Unlike in previous books, Soul Eaters don't hide their true faces, and they are hideous. Oak Mage is a sadistic brute; Bat Mage is willing to sacrifice lives for her goal; Viper Mage is like an apple filled with worms - beautiful outside, but rotten inside; and Eagle Owl Mage is practically all dead inside. Besides, we learn a lot about Soul Eaters. What are their goals? How are they able to control demons? What really happened during the Great Fire that almost destroyed Soul Eaters? Eye of Viper cave is just as creepy - normally I like underground actions, but Michelle Paver creates such an eerie air and conveys the feeling of damp, stuffy and cramped place. The rituals held to find the Door and to summon demons were terrifying so I could almost feel demons' presence."}, {"userName": "Big Pete", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47746222-big-pete", "userReview": "Soul Eater opens in the silence of the forest as winter sets in. Torak and Renn are hunting, and Torak notices an owl feather lying upon the snow. He hopes it's not a bad omen. It is. In moments, Wolf is abducted and Torak and Renn hunt his pursuers, venturing into the far north, where nothing is as it seems and one slip upon the ice can spell your doom...Soul Eater is a much darker book than Wolf Brother and Spirit Walker, with less action and more travelling, but when violence comes it is savage and brutal. The relationships between the characters are more widely explored, as Torak and Renn's friendship is tested to the breaking point on their journey. The Soul Eaters make a collective appearance, all of the survivors coming together for a twisted ritual that warps the code of the Forest clans. We get more than a glimpse of this shadowy cabal, learning the names and faces of its members. Thiazzi the Oak Mage is a sadistic giant, as strong and unyielding as his Clan's symbol. Seshru the Viper Mage is a rotten heart hidden beneath a beautiful exterior. Nef the Bat Mage is a melancholic, sympathetic character who nonetheless is willing to kill for her goals. And then there is Eostra, the enigmatic Eagle Owl Mage, the spectral mastermind behind the cabal's plans. We get a fascinating look at the lifestyle of the Ice Clans, how they hunt and survive in their frozen homeland. Soul Eater is the novel where Paver's prose really hits the peak, reaching an area where it is perfect to read for all ages. She creates a claustrophobic cavern where the foul rituals take place, constructing a frozen tundra where you can feel the icy wind bite into you. I really enjoyed re-reading Soul Eater and I have no reservations about recommending it."}, {"userName": " Marla", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/593597-marla", "userReview": "[Torak took a huge risk walking into the cave. It was just dumb luck that no one recognized he wasn't the other boy. I was irritated at Torak for not trusting Renn more. I think they should've gone back for help to the Raven Clan when Wolf was taken, but that is truly adolescent thinking.Why didn't the soul eaters just wait until they got all the things together before casting the spell without adequate protection. I know they were trying to do it on certain day, but they could even wait until next year. They seemed very disorganized for people who've been planning to open the demon gate for years.Torak should Spirit Walk less. It is too dangerous to be done lightly. The Soul Eaters realize that Torak is the Spirit Walker when he takes over an ice bear to fight them.

It wasn't too interesting, so I was a bit scared going into this book. Scared of loosing interest completely. But it just kept getting better and better! The story is very fluent and everything happens so quickly, but not too quickly - You still keep up all the way through.By the time they had entered the grotto, I was struck with enormous feelings towards these character and actually felt a genuine interest in how they were going to make it. All the time there was something new and excising happening! When Renn got stuck and felt claustrophobic, I felt really uneasy too since I really, REALLY hate small spaces. There were also a couple of places where I almost started crying, and felt genuine sad. In the end where it turns out that Torak got marks as a Soul Eater; man, that was amazing! I legit let out a silent gasp as I was listening to it.Michelle's way of describing feelings and the surrounding environment is fantastic. I could feel the cold snow, the harsh ice, the sharp and steamy walls of the grotto. I could taste the seal lard and feel the pain as they went up into the north. She's also an expert at describing the life in the stone age, I feel like I'm learning so much from reading these.This feels like THE book where everything finally happens, like the first two were a buildup to this one, and I'll definitely check out the next book.

It is not a book for children of elementary school age. I would even question it for children of junior high school age. Once a teen or adult though, one would have to know the person. For myself personally, I found some parts upsetting and difficult to read. There are portions of the book which are about animal cruelty which were very upsetting to me. Also, there were portions about demons and sacrifice which were hard for me to read. On the positive side, it is a very exciting book and very fast paced. The author's extensive research on old tribes of people and their customs really made the book interesting. Also, her research on animals and their habits shone through on the pages of this book. Sometimes, I felt that I could see through the eyes of these animals and it was a wonderful, exhilarating feeling.
