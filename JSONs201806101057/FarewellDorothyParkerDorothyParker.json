But in order to make this work, the writing needs to be as clever as Parker herself, and that just doesn\u2019t happen in this book. When the mechanism for bringing the ghost into the story becomes one of the more plausible things in the story, you\u2019ve got a problem on your hands. Meister, unfortunately, seems not to have learned one of the most basic lessons of writing: Show, don\u2019t tell. She explains everything--some of it in the first two or three chapters and some of it multiple times. Her heroine, Violet Epps, writes \u201cscathing\u201d movie reviews (although the bits we see don\u2019t look all that scathing) but is a simp in real life. The explanation for this is absurd, the writing is leaden and Violet (Shrinking Violet--get it?) is an unsympathetic ninny. And in between the wants-to-be-whimsical narrative, we get bits and pieces of Parker\u2019s life. (some of which, we discover in the Afterward, aren\u2019t even true.)

The story is as original and clever as Dorothy herself and the heart and humor as endearing. It begins with Violett Epps, a movie critic who wishes that she could be as daring in real life as she comes off in her reviews. For inspiration she visits the famed Algonquin Hotel in New York, the chic meeting place for the irreverent Dorothy Parker and other famous writers back in the 1920s.But she gets more than lunch. Seems that Dorothy has returned to her old haunt (literally) as an unsettled ghost with issues to resolve. She latches on to Violet and takes them both for an unexpected ride.In this unpredictable and fast paced tale, readers will find themselves under Ellen Meister's magical spell. This is one of the most evocative and fun reads in a very long time.I had the privilege of reading an advanced copy, but you can enjoy the novel when it is published in February, 2013.Mark your calendar!!"}, {"userName": "Allison Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/673993-allison-campbell", "userReview": "FAREWELL, DOROTHY PARKER by Ellen Meister turns out to be chick lit. I'm starting this review with a disclaimer that chick lit is not normally what I read. It is possible that this is wonderful for chick lit. I was drawn to this title by the promise of Dorothy Parker's influence on a modern movie critic, Violet Epps, who is witty and confident in print, but a disaster in real life. Doesn't that sound fun? The book promises that the spirit of Dorothy Parker will help Violet find her voice and blah blah blah. At the same time, Dorothy Parker will blah blah blah until she is finally ready to go toward the light and blah blah blah.Where do I start? I disliked Violet. No, 'dislike' is too strong a word. I didn't particularly care about Violet, because she's not a fully realized character. She has a few \"defining moments\" in her past that are summarized for the reader, which I believe are meant to evoke sympathy. The explanation for her social anxiety is facile and, frankly, insulting, and a genuine depiction of a character suffering from such would have been much more sympathetic. Instead, we have a tacked-on reason why the \"heroine\" has so much trouble asserting herself outside her movie reviews, and naturally, she must confront that \"reason\" before the end of the novel and blah blah blah. At one point, Violet is reviewing a sappy film and comments, \"I said a little prayer I save for these moments: Please, surprise me. In fact, I wound up saying that prayer about a dozen times during this movie. It was never answered.\" I could not have said it better myself. The premise of this novel had such promise, but instead of being caught in a refreshing breeze, I had to plod against the current of its predictability to finally, thankfully, reach the predictable end.Violet has so much going on in her life. Her only sister died a year before. She is involved in a custody battle for Delaney, her thirteen-year-old niece. Her boyfriend is a jackass. She has a lame backstory to explain her social anxiety. A new intern at work is out to get her. I can see why she needs Dorothy's help. But even with Dorothy coaching her, Violet is reluctant to stand up for herself, long past the point of believability. I'm surprised Dorothy didn't tell her to grow a pair (or some more 1920s-ish idiom) and stop wasting her time. When Violet finally throws over the jackass boyfriend, I was relieved rather than triumphant. Check that box off the list of requisite plot developments and move on to the next one. Her plot with Dorothy to gain custody of Delaney is briefly a bright spot in the book: \"'You simply explain to him that if he and his darling, long-suffering wife don't drop the case, you will have no choice but to tell her about the affair.' 'That's almost blackmail,' Violet said. 'No, my dear. That is blackmail.'\" Then we go back to the main point of the book: Violet needs a better boyfriend. Yes, that's what I want to teach my daughter: become a strong woman so you can dump the jerk and get a nice man.If you're drawn to this title as a Dorothy Parker fan (as I was), I suggest skipping it and rereading some of Parker's writings and Meade's biography WHAT FRESH HELL IS THIS? The Dorothy in this book, along with every other character, is sketched lightly with a number two pencil and colored strictly within the lines. I was (obviously) disappointed in this novel's lack of depth, but since I don't really read chick lit, I'm not sure if that's a genre failure or particular to this novel.

I was immediately enticed by her searing quick wit, found a friend in her use of sarcasm and a kindred soulmate in deep cynicism.I was delighted when I found Farewell, Dorothy Parker. And by 'delighted' I spazzed in a most unflattering fangirl fashion. It kind of looked like this:Awkward, I know. That just goes to show my fierce love of Ms. Parker, despite the fact that such displays of over-emotion would grant me a rather stinging verbal barb from her. The premise reminded me a bit of Sophie Kinsella's Twenties Girl and while there were some similarities, as whole they were very different. Ellen Meister managed to do what I think few could; channel Dorothy Parker, write her as a fictional character with her biting wit and her 'voice' making it believable and charming, because without that this book would have fallen flat on it's face on it's way to the dumpster.If you like Dorothy Parker, unintentional humor, sarcasm, stories of self-discovery and ghosts, don't pass up ."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1710557-amy", "userReview": "Disclaimer: Every time I saw or thought of this book, Just One of those Things began running through my head. And now it's in your head, too. Just one of those things, I guess.On to my thoughts of this book. I'm a Dorothy Parker fan. I think we're a dying breed. So when I read that Ellen Meister, who is also a Dorothy Parker Fan, upon seeing all the Jane Austen spin-offs, had written a book around one of her literary favorites, I was in. The premise of the story is clever. Movie critic Violet Epps, as fiery in her reviews as she is timid in her real life, manages through a quirk of fates, to unleash the ghost of Dorothy Parker. Violet's personal life is a bit of a mess in just about every aspect: love, family, work. The quick witted Mrs Parker jumps in to help Violet strengthen her resolve, grow a backbone, get some courage, which is both helpful and horrific. In turn, Violet works to get the ghost to resolve some issues. The story itself is an interesting mix of Parkerisms, historical facts, and poignancy. Violet's love life is a mess because of her timidity. She also is involved in a nasty battle for the custody of her beloved niece, orphaned the year before when Violet's sister and brother-in-law died. Plus she has a cut-throat assistant at the office to deal with. But her relationships with the niece, love interest, and co-worker ring true. This reader was able to follow her emotional growth, even though I did cringe each time Dorothy interfered as there were some disasters when she did so. There were a few minor plot developments that irked me, but overall, I had fun reading this. I even pulled a couple of books of Parker's writings off the shelf to add to my \"to be read\" pile. My main problem with stories that revolve around a literary or historical figure being involved in a fiction book is that I often don't like how they are portrayed. While this characterization did not always match up to mine, it was fine. And probably, if I had met Mrs Parker in person, she would have terrified me. Many thanks to LibraryThing and the publisher for sending me this AR copy.3.5 stars*As Dorothy Parker once said to her boyfriend: \"Fare thee well!\"As Columbus announced when he knew he was bounced: \"It was swell, Isabelle, swell!\""}, {"userName": "Judy Collins", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-collins", "userReview": "Farewell, Dorothy Parker  (#1) by talented Ellen Meister brings back to life the ghost, quick witted literary icon, Dorothy Parker with movie critic Violet Epps, setting the stage for tantalizing, upcoming, Dorothy Parker Drank Here, (#2), coming, Feb 24, 2015.A fan of both the author and Dorothy Parker,  Meister creates a sassy fun book about Violet, a movie critic with all sorts of issues; her boyfriend and battling for custody of her recently orphaned niece Delaney.

I must confess that, although the name Dorothy Parker was familiar to me, I didn't know much of anything at all about the woman. Therefore, when it came time to read the book, I waited for about a week. During this week, I vacillated, trying to decide if I should read up on the late Mrs. Parker before I read a fictional novel that included her. In the end, I decided that since this was supposed to be fiction, it would be better to read it without any foreknowledge of the woman. Farewell, Dorothy Parker is not about Dorothy Parker, though. It is the tale of Violet Epps, a movie critic who has no problem cutting down the movies that don't entertain her, but cannot for the life of her manage to stand up to the people in her real life: her boyfriend, her niece's guardians, her boss's assistant. She lets these people do what they want, and resigns herself to the consequences of their actions. Until the day the long-dead Dorothy Parker enters her life. While at the Algonquin Hotel, Mrs. Parker drops into Violet's lap and her life, wreaking havoc with every part of Violet's life. Her romantic relationships; the battle over her niece, Delaney; her job \u2013 it's all fair game to Mrs. Parker. Dorothy Parker pulls no punches and doesn't worry about hurt feelings. She pushes Violet to become the woman Mrs. Parker knows she can be: a woman who stands up for herself and others, and doesn't put up with any crap from anyone. But Violet isn't the only one we see changing. Dorothy Parker's spirit has been hanging around the Algonquin Hotel since her death, unwilling (or maybe unable) to let go and move into the next realm. Initial impressions of Mrs. Parker lead us to believe that she's a hardened, cynical ghost \u2013 much as she appeared to be as a woman. But as the story moves on, as Mrs. Parker encourages Violet out of her shell, we begin to catch glimpses of another side to the ghost woman \u2013 a side that is kind and caring. Farewell, Dorothy Parker is largely a comedy. It hits the mark with witty dialogue and hilarious circumstances. Delaney's grandfather is particularly funny in many ways. But it also has its touching moments, where we learn about the painful pasts of each of the main characters. In learning about their hurt, it becomes even easier to empathize with them. Even the characters that are obviously not supposed to be our favorites are written in such a way that you can see their human side. You still may never be particularly fond of them, but you can see where they're coming from. There are no one dimensional characters in this book. Every one of them is the kind of person I could easily expect to run into out on the street. Mrs. Meister did an excellent job of dropping in the necessary back story on each of the characters, giving us the tidbits we needed at just the right moment. There is always a clear distinction between present and past, yet it is still smoothly woven together to make a seamless story. And as for Dorothy Parker: what can I say about the ghostly character that Meister created? She was great with a wisecrack, astonishingly perceptive, and almost brutally honest. She also had no problem manipulating a situation to either fit her own desires, or to achieve the effect that she knew Violet really wanted or needed. For a sometimes transparent character, Meister definitely made her very real. Now I'll answer the question that some of you are surely asking: Did Meister capture the essence of the real Dorothy Parker? First, let me say that the author freely admits in the acknowledgments that she took certain liberties with the facts of Mrs. Parker's life, and states clearly that this is not intended as a factual account of her life. However, after I finished the book, I did begin to do a little research into Mrs. Parker's life. Although I did not research her as thoroughly as Meister did, I did research her enough to believe that the way Mrs. Parker was depicted in the story was fairly true to life. The image I formed of Dorothy Parker from reading the book, and the image that I formed based on the factual details I found meshed very well. I would say that Meister did an excellent job of bringing Dorothy Parker back to life on the pages of the book. Dorothy Parker once said that she would never be famous because she never did anything. Obviously, she was wrong. What's wonderful, though, is that thanks to Ellen Meister, Dorothy Parker can now become famous to a new generation of people \u2013 people who will now read and learn about her after reading Meister's book. Farewell, Dorothy Parker is a wonderfully written novel that will make you laugh, touch you gently, and bring to life a woman who, in many ways, should be an inspiration to all women. I would highly recommend it to all women, and to readers in general."}, {"userName": "Myfanwy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/140287-myfanwy", "userReview": "If you\u2019ve read Ellen Meister\u2019s previous novels, then you know she is an incredibly talented and thoughtful writer.

At the heart of this novel is Violet Epps, an outwardly timid movie critic who uses her pen to speak the words she dare not say aloud. At the book\u2019s opening, Violet has lost much in her life and is in danger of losing more (she is engaged in a custody battle over her niece).It\u2019s not until the spirit of Dorothy Parker enters her world that Violet begins to find her true voice, at first through channeling Dorothy Parker, but eventually by learning that the strength she has always sought so that she might express herself by speaking as well as writing, has always existed within her. And it is in using that voice that Violet is finally able to have everything she ever wanted, but didn\u2019t dare to believe she deserved.This book will make you laugh and cry by equal measures.

Whether it\u2019s breaking up with her boyfriend or bettering her family relationships, she just doesn\u2019t have the oomph she needs. She summons her muse, Dorothy Parker, audacious and witty writer of the 1920s, to pull her out of her timidity.

I got an ARC of this book free from the publisher in exchange for writing a review. And now I have to write a review for a book that I hated.I signed up for the ARC based on my love of Dorothy Parker. I discovered one of her stories in an anthology my freshman year of college, sought out more, finally put my hands on The Portable Dorothy Parker, and then basically became obsessed with her. I wrote my senior thesis on her. I wrote another seminar paper on her in grad school. Parker is not an unusual obsession for your more bookish young ladies. She was just that awesome.Here\u2019s the thing Farewell doesn\u2019t seem to know about Dorothy Parker (or care about her): she was a devastatingly talented writer. She had an amazing grasp of structure and characterization, and she could turn a phrase like nobody\u2019s business. She didn\u2019t do it just to engage in witty repartee; she used her words to build startling, rich images. I understand the lure of the mythology surrounding Parker: her biting wit, her high-functioning alcoholism, her place among the legendary raconteurs of the Algonquin Round Table. But this book is using Parker more like someone\u2019s feisty old aunt.Our protagonist here is Violet, a mid-thirties film critic who writes with verve and edge, but lives her life as a marshmallow peep. Through some necessary contrivance, she comes into possession of a book that contains Parker\u2019s ghost. Parker becomes a de facto life coach for Violet, who is desperately in need of help with her career, her love life, and a fraught family situation. Ghost Parker, rascal that she is, often wrecks things en route to ultimately fixing them.The story is simplistic, but that\u2019s not where it goes wrong with me. What particularly bothered me\u2014without cease\u2014was the continual inability of the characters to behave in naturalistic or psychologically plausible ways. I don\u2019t mean they made choices I disagreed with\u2014great characters do that all the time. I mean that these characters made choices that made literally no sense in any context, neither as functional, responsible choices, nor as dysfunctional, damaging choices. They made contrived choices\u2014baffling choices\u2014tear-my-hair-out frustratingly inane choices.Violet\u2019s interactions with her love interest, for example, the too-good-to-be-true he\u2019s-so-hot-but-also-so-incredibly-perceptive-and-nurturing kung fu instructor, indicate that she is approximately nine years old. She is so timid around him she basically faints every time they attempt to converse. I think we\u2019re actually supposed to feel for Violet\u2019s predicament, like \u201cOh that poor shy girl!\u201d But, I reiterate, she is in her 30s. Her behavior at every turn is childish and lacks self-awareness. I feel sorry for her, all right. She earns my pity. She\u2014and her fictional sisters in foolishness\u2014are the reason I don\u2019t typically read chick lit.Another element that bothered me is that I\u2019m not sure this author really knows what is good confrontation and what isn\u2019t. Violet manages to unload her ungrateful boyfriend early on, by hemming and hawing over him forever, and then, with Parker\u2019s assistance, giving him one dramatic takedown. The book doesn\u2019t care about whether he\u2019s a good guy or not, of course; it doesn\u2019t give him a single good quality to hang a hat on, so we know we\u2019re supposed to be 100% on Violet\u2019s side. But it is not emotionally healthy to internalize your problems for an incredibly long time and then just blow up on someone for not reading your mind. You don\u2019t want to be with him, just tell him you don\u2019t want to be with him. Wish him well, send him off. You don\u2019t need to eviscerate him to prove you have a backbone. But the book is so tone-deaf that it portrays this as a victory.Later, Violet\u2019s co-worker \u2018stands up to\u2019 an editorial assistant who made overzealous corrections to his work. And the narrative specifically sets up this juxtaposition of the two, a fifty-year-old man in the prime of his career, and a twenty-something girl trying to make a name for herself. Again, not a single good quality exists to make us feel any sympathy for this young assistant, but this man dresses her down like a DICK. Neither Violet nor the author seem to see the sexism at work here, the gross entitled behavior of this man; instead Violet wishes fervently that she also\u2026could be a dick, I guess.Later, Violet \u2018stands up to\u2019 the same girl by tearing her down (incompetently, because she\u2019s Violet) and making her do demeaning work. Great management style there, excellent. She makes the girl get her coffee in the morning. Is that not an invitation to get it pissed in? But it turns out the girl likes being bitched out. She responds positively to this. It makes her feel at home. Of course it does. Because no one in this fictional world approaches anything like actual psychological realism.But I think of all of them, the ultimate baffling, \u201cWHAT WORLD IS THIS?\u201d portion of the narrative was the backstory between Violet and her dearly departed sister, Ivy. Apparently the reason Violet is so timid in personality is because she repressed her biting wit as a child after being shunned by her sister. This is written as an intense childhood trauma\u2014having her sister not speak to her for a couple of days, because Violet zinged her? First of all, Violet\u2019s beloved mother should have shut that nonsense down. These are little elementary school-aged girls; their mother should still be running interference. \u201cViolet, don\u2019t be rude.\u201d \u201cIvy, don\u2019t be so sensitive.\u201d DONE. Instead, Dear Mama is cuddling up to Violet saying, \u201cDon\u2019t cry, darling, Ivy will forgive you someday!\u201dAlso, a penchant for zingers is not like, I don\u2019t know, being a werewolf. You don\u2019t need to reign yourself in that hard. You\u2019re not going to kill anybody.There\u2019s a difference between straight talk and sass. There\u2019s a difference between backbone and bitchiness. But this book is not nuanced enough to acknowledge those differences, much less do anything with them.Contrivances and implausibilities aside, maybe I could forgive all of this if the book was well-written, but it isn\u2019t. The narrative contains endless awkward moments in which Violet recounts Dorothy Parker factoids to herself.Take this one (page 34):Violet laughed, remembering that Dorothy Parker had spent a number of years on the West Coast, writing movie scripts and fighting with studio heads. Once, in a snide reference to the power wielded by one of the most imperious moviemakers, Dorothy Parker had quipped that the streets in Hollywood were paved with Goldwyn.Still later, she referred to another studio as \u201cTwentieth Century F**ks.\u201dViolet asked Dorothy Parker if she wanted something to eat.There are at least a dozen incidences of Parker stories being shoehorned into the narrative this way. I am mystified as to why this was considered the best way to get that information in there. It seems like anything else would have been better. Have Dorothy tell the stories herself, as dialogue, for example! (Surely she must have been a recounter of her own adventures.) Or use metatextual footnotes. I\u2019ve seen it done in fiction novels. Or set the anecdotes apart from the narrative as italicized chapter headings or something. ANYTHING. Anything different.If you are a veteran reader of Dorothy Parker, I would not recommend Farewell. You will be disappointed. You will not feel her legacy is well-served. Well-drawn, complex, consistent characters such as you\u2019re accustomed to finding in Parker\u2019s own stories are not present here.If everything you know about Parker can be encapsulated in a snappy quip on a refrigerator magnet, go for it."}, {"userName": "Chelsea", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5681317-chelsea", "userReview": "When it comes to movie reviews, critic Violet Epps is a powerhouse voice. But that\u2019s only because she\u2019s learned to channel her literary hero, Dorothy Parker, the most celebrated and scathing wit of the twentieth century. If only Violet could summon that kind of strength in her personal life.Gripped by paralyzing anxiety, Violet visits the Algonquin Hotel in an attempt to pull strength from the hallowed dining room, where Dorothy Parker and so many other famous writers of the 1920s traded barbs. But she gets more than she bargained for, and the feisty spirit re-materializes . . . hitching a ride onto Violet\u2019s already troubled life.An irreverent ghost with problems of her own\u2014including a refusal to cross over to the afterlife\u2014Mrs. Parker helps Violet face her fears, becoming mentor, tormentor, and, with any luck, friend. Wickedly funny and surprisingly poignant, Farewell, Dorothy Parker perfectly re-imagines one of America\u2019s most iconic voices in a touching and unforgettable tale.Dorothy Parker (August 22, 1893 \u2013 June 7, 1967) was an American poet, short story writer, critic and satirist, best known for her wit, wisecracks, and eye for 20th-century urban foibles.From a conflicted and unhappy childhood, Parker rose to acclaim, both for her literary output in such venues as The New Yorker and as a founding member of the Algonquin Round Table. Following the breakup of the circle, Parker traveled to Hollywood to pursue screenwriting. Her successes there, including two Academy Award nominations, were curtailed as her involvement in left-wing politics led to a place on the Hollywood blacklist.Dismissive of her own talents, she deplored her reputation as a \"wisecracker\". Nevertheless, her literary output and reputation for her sharp wit have endured.I enjoyed the book very much. I liked that Violet's hero came back from the dead to encourage her! How many of us can say that about our earthly heroes?! LOLI like the themes of reaching out, inside of oneself, for strength to rise to the scary challenges of life; the themes of loss and death and saying goodbye to loved ones; walking to the light after death; new friendships and how they can change lives forever; learning from those with whom one has difficulties by reaching out and not judging solely on appearances.And, as those of you who read my reviews know, one thing I don't like is when authors have characters take the Lord's name in vain to show a their toughness or anger. Put a bunch of symbols, please, &%%#@A8^%**, and leave the rest to my imagination. I have a great imagination. :-D"}, {"userName": "Viviane Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2682057-viviane-crystal", "userReview": "Violet Epps is a scathing movie critic who is called some not-so-nice names on internet blogs by those who follow her reviews. In person, however, she is a meek person who stifled her opinions after a childhood scene with her sister that resulted in the family shunning her with silence for being so embarrassingly outspoken. Now, however, Violet needs to get some guts in order to dump her needy, self-centered boyfriend and to speak up at work where her job is threatened by a newbie trying to impress the bosses by editing Violet\u2019s reviews in a way that reads grammatically perfect but stilts Violet\u2019s style big-time!After meeting her boyfriend at the famous Algonquin Restaurant, where she fails to follow-up on her intention to call off their relationship, she accidentally slips into her bag a book signed by famous writers in the 1920s. Arriving home, however, she is shocked to discover that when the book is open, the ghost of notable writer Dorothy Parker is alive and well and is determined to change Violet from the \u201cshrinking\u201d side of that flower to an audacious, feisty woman who will speak her mind as required, with no holds.What follows is a fun, spunky, tension-ridden, but endearing tale of Violet\u2019s conversion and Dorothy\u2019s delight in carrying forward her outrageous reputation for shocking all but getting exactly what she wants. Violet will get rid of the drip, get her colleague in the right place, and meet someone who will change her world, as Dorothy urges her to learn to flirt and become a \u201chot\u201d contemporary gal. Yes, Dorothy is hysterically funny in her audacious comments and urgings which at times scare the heck out of Violet but which then make complete sense. Dorothy was a healthy dose of reality with no sugar-coated platitudes filling her writing or conversation way back when, a woman before her times but the perfect medicine for curing our heroine of the disease, excessive timidity. Absolutely delightful and great comic, romantic read!"}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1757121-sharon", "userReview": "Movie critic Violet Epps is outspoken ... on paper. In person, she suffers from crippling social anxiety. She's afraid to break up with her loser/user boyfriend. She's afraid to speak up to her niece's grandparents ... the ones whom she is battling for custody of the teenaged girl after Violet's sister and husband die in a car accident. She's afraid to talk to her kung fu instructor, Michael, because she has a crush on him.In other words, she's kind of a mess.Until the day she decides to go to the Algonquin Hotel and eat where her literary idol, Dorothy Parker, used to dine -- and to break up with Carl, the loser/user. Because Carl announces her name loudly (he believes that dating her gives him prestige), Violet is asked to sign the Algonquin's historical guest book ... which, as soon as it is opened, releases the ghost of Dorothy Parker.When Violet accidentally takes the guest book home, Dorothy comes with her.What ensues is a story so clever and poignant that I alternately laughed and yes, cried. We learn why Violet developed her social anxiety and watch Dorothy help her through it -- physically, in some instances. We are treated to Parker's sardonic wit, tempered with more love than Parker's fans might expect. We see characters who are all in pain, trying to get through life the best they can without letting anyone know how much they need anyone else. In other words, they're all very realistic people -- including, interestingly enough, Dorothy Parker's ghost.Most of all, what we get is a book that was so delightful that I finished it in a single day -- I did not want to stop reading.

The storyline was appealing and an interesting way to show tribute to Ms. Parker. I just wish that the author would have shared more of Ms. Parker than what most fans already know. I didn't learn anything that I hadn't already discovered on my own, which really was quite basic information. As far as the writing style, the text is too \"prescribed\". Ms. Meister doesn't allow the reader to think or feel for herself. Instead she consistently prescribes how the reader should think or feel by explaining every exchange between the characters. It reminds me of when a person tells a joke and no one laughs so he explains the joke to make sure his audience \"got it\". Ms. Meister used such a technique to continually force the reader to see things as prescribed instead of trusting her writing to elicit the desired affect. This made the characters flat and difficult to connect to. The juxtaposition of Ms. Meister's style with that of her mentor was quite ironic."}, {"userName": "Lormac", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3743024-lormac", "userReview": "I had to toss in the towel on this one, and that was tough to do becuase I am a big Dorothy Parker fan. I was listening to it on CD and the thought of 6 more disks like the first two was exhausting; maybe if I was reading it on paper I would have skimmed to the end, slowing down when Mrs. Parker appears, but as I had no option to do so with the CDs, I ditched it.From my limited experience with the book, I would say it comes alive when Mrs. Parker is present but otherwise, it is akin to a Hallmark Hall of Fame special - sad, lonely (but beautiful) spinster, semi-secret life as a fearsome movie critic but timid in real life, with an orphaned niece, an unsuitable boyfriend and a fluffy little dog. Clear to me (and this is no spoiler), that she will get up the gumption to dump the boyfriend, gain custody of the niece and find a handsome charming boyfriend who loves fluffy little dogs.

That biting acerbic wit! The pithy, completely to the point remarks! Why can't I have/do that? Loved all the references to DP's writings, I believe she was as self-centered as she appears in this book. She would use whoever and whatever was handy to appease her own demons. Now, having said all that, I really did not expect to like this book as much as I did. Figured everyone else on earth would get it wrong and I'm just not a talented enough writer to do it myself. I was, of course, mistaken. Ellen Meister has always been good and this novel was no exception. To make the (other) main character pretty much the opposite of Ms Parker and watch the interactions was a really good choice. Add in the stress of the sister's death and the fight for the niece just made it all work. Fun book.

Hoping a little Dorothy Parker will rub off on her she visits Algonquin Hotel, the place Parker and the Vicious Circle used to meet daily. While there the manager shares an treasured guest book with her. Inside were the signatures like Robert Benchley, George S. Kaufman, Dorothy Parker and more. Violet unintentionally ends up leaving with the guest book in her purse. Little did she know she had Dorothy\u2019s spirit as well.This truly was a fun and entertaining read but it had some sobering moments as well. Violet\u2019s sister and her husband were killed in a car accident and she is fighting to gain custody of her niece. Violet needs to be on her very best behavior and follow the judges orders and that isn\u2019t always easy but having an outspoken and sometimes overly friendly ghost nearby makes things even more difficult. It also creates havoc at work and in Violet\u2019s romantic life.Ellen Meister has brought the Vanity Fair writer to life in a very interesting way. I couldn\u2019t wait to see what would happen next and cringing when Dorothy really crossed the line. The relationship between these two ladies had me laughing out loud and crying a little too, forgetting that while she could be seen by others, Dorothy was just a spirit and they couldn\u2019t stay together forever. A spirit the helped Violet find her own voice and exceed her own expectations.Farewell Dorothy Parker is a well researched fiction story and the author admits she has taken some liberties to write the book she had been dreaming of writing.
