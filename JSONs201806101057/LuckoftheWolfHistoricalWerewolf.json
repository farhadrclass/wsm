Confused. Complicated. Why??? I couldn't figure out the point to it all. Did it really have to be so hopelessly complicated? We're following Aria, Cort, Yuri, and Babette in the story. At one point or another we get a POV from each character. Each one of those characters is unlikeable. Aria was innocent and naive and insanely easy to manipulate. Cort was ashamed of being a werewolf and came off as really repressed. He also manipulated and lied to Aria throughout most of the book. Yuri plotted with Cort to play Aria and then had another plot on top of that plot! Babette plotted with Yuri but then also plotted to thwart him. Do you see what I'm getting at here? Everyone was plotting, and more often than not, an event or person would thwart part of the plan and then they had to skew the plot even more. The outside characters would plot against the main characters-who were already plotting to escape those outside characters-while the main characters plotted against Aria. But all the main characters weren't on the same page so they were also busy plotting against each other and then plotting to make sure that they weren't discovered. Confused? I was. Through it all, Aria just hung around like a dumb cow waiting to be taken to the butcher shop.The writing in this book was really odd. I can't put my finger on what exactly this author does differently, but it results in a very distant experience for the reader. The way it's written seems to emphasize the fact that you are an outsider reading a book. I, personally, like to feel a little bit more caught up in the story. It was even more pronounced in the love scenes, by the way. This book strongly reminded me of the \"old school\" romance style. Minus the rape, that is. The events felt overwhelming and it seemed like the heroine never came out on top. She wanted to run free as a werewolf and didn't care about the life they kept trying to convince her was better. Her opinions of, and acceptance of, her previous circumstances seemed to be looked down on and scorned even at the end. It was frustrating, because I wish that Aria would have once told them to screw it and went and did what she wanted. But no...she fell in love and automatically decided that love made ignoring her wants and needs worth it. Like I said, it reminded me of the older romances. It also didn't help that strong emphasis was placed on how innocent and naive and trusting Aria was. I don't think I'll read anything else by this author. Even if I was willing to take a chance on liking the next set of characters better, I don't think I would ever search out this style of writing again. I like my third person view to be more absorbing."}, {"userName": "Laura the Highland Hussy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2043222-laura-the-highland-hussy", "userReview": "I received this book as an ARCThis book was quite a mess. I've only read one other book by Susan Krinard- Touch of the Wolf- but this was not only very similar, but not as well written.The main premise of this story is that a female werewolf named Aria who has to hide her true identity, is being taken to America from her small Austrian town. Her guardian Franz knows everything, but has yet to tell Aria anything. He has kept her hidden away from the world in a cabin in the mountains allowing her to run wild. However, once in New York, Franz is killed and all of his papers and money are stolen, so Aria still knows nothing other than her family is in San Francisco. So she takes a train to San Fran and gets kidnapped by some less than above board men.Enter our hero Cort. Beauregard Cortland Renier originally of the Louisiana bayou wins Aria at a poker game. He recognizes her as a female werewolf, and saves her from an awful fate. Thus begins the pack of lies Susan Krinard tries to feed us.Her book was so unnecessarily complicated it is unreal.Cort's friend Yuri recognizes Aria's eyes and sees her as lost relative to a wealthy family in New Orleans. He convinces Cort to go along with his plan.Meanwhile, Aria feigns amnesia for no reason I could figure out. Then Yuri and Cort bring in Babette, a former whore and the most famous madame in NOLA who is now a respectable widow in Denver. Babette's job is to train Aria the half wild wolf-girl to act like a lady a la My Fair Lady. Next the connection to the Renier family in New Orleans is kept from Aria and it becomes very like the movie Anastasia. It is my belief that Susan Krinard must have watched an Audrey Hepburn marathon before getting the idea for this book.During all this weird lying and plotting behind everyone's backs, we have a Duke from the old country who is trying to stage a coup and usurp the royal throne back in that tiny country near Austria. So he wants Aria. But even the Duke has an alias.Every character here had ulterior motives and plots that WERE COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY!! The plot could have carried on without all of the misconceptions and lies and half-truths. It was a sloppy job of trying to write an intrigue into the romance.Once everyone is done double-crossing and backstabbing each other, they end up in New Orleans where everyone is treated poorly. Cort at one point courted the beautiful daughter of the NOLA Reniers, Madeleine, but she accused him of forcing her and had her male relatives beat the crap out of him. She never then insulted Aria and Cort, and we, the readers, are just to take it?! Really? It was frustrating that Susan Krinard never gave us any resolution with any part of that, or with the bad guys. They were conveniently dead. No suffering, no finding out they were wrong, just dead with a tidy bow on top for the poor reading to just roll over and believe. Then everyone was double-crossed again, and might I add that it was out of left field! It not only didn't flow, but added to the irritating mess that I call Luck of the Wolf by Susan Krinard."}, {"userName": "Sandra Dagg", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13054860-sandra-dagg", "userReview": "I have just finished this book, and once again, a very enjoyable story. Not a 5 star story this time, but that's only because, for some reason, the characters didn't grab me quite as strongly as the ones in the previous stories did. I think I balked at the hero's continual refusal (in his mind) to believe that he was being duped by someone he wanted to believe was not all bad. He was smart, too smart I think, to fall for the other man's lies as often as he did. That is my only negative comment, otherwise, as I said, another great read!"}, {"userName": "Marilyn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4770510-marilyn", "userReview": "I have enjoyed this book like I have enjoyed all her wolf books.Look forward to more!!!!! :))))))))))))))))))))"}, {"userName": "Janice Rose", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39689423-janice-rose", "userReview": "A good first in a series!I enjoyed this story.

Happy reading!"}, {"userName": "Wenj", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3262412-wenj", "userReview": "Review provided by Black Lagoon Reviews:Luck of the Wolf by Susan Krinard is filled with calculated manipulation, betrayal and deceit while keeping the whimsical story of a budding romance alive and well. Melded wonderfully with a story that seems like it should be straight out of a fairy tale, I was enthralled with the world that was brought to life in these pages.As this was my first time reading Krinard\u2019s work I started out a little skeptical that the romance would keep me interested. However, I was soon put at ease because the plot is very intricate with layers of secrets and deceits that are continually being stripped away, thus slowly revealing the true nature of the characters. This added a nice suspense to the novel because you are never really sure at any given time what any of their true motives are throughout the story. I really enjoyed this aspect; it added a depth with the ever increasing plot-within a-plot scenarios that played out well against the more enchanting backdrop about a far away European kingdom, its murdered king and queen, and their missing daughter. It was also interesting to see how that would play out against a more menial mystery about a missing girl from a prominent New Orleans werewolf clan. Not to mention how any of this tied back to the main characters that seem so separated from these events. All in all I was really captured by the complexities and how all the threads tied into a nice bow at the end that left only a few unanswered questions.I also loved the complexities of the characters themselves. From the main characters to the secondary characters they all have a unique history and voice as well as hidden agendas and secrets. First impressions are often misleading in this respect and the true provence of the characters is slowly revealed to the readers over a long span which leads to some shocking discoveries in the long run.Like I said, first impression are often misleading in this book and mine of the main character Aria is no exception. There is a weakness and naivet\u00e9 about her at first glance and I began the story thinking she could only play the victim, hiding behind strong male leads, and while to some extent that was true, she comes to demonstrate an iron will and a stubborn disposition that was remarkable. She is a free spirit who unabashedly says whatever is on her mind, but is continually made to believe that she should be demure if she is to fit into \u2018polite society\u2019. Through her we see the hypocrisy of the time and come to love her inner defiance. She is quite a rational and intelligent female character who follows her head and her heart instead of bending to the whims and manipulations of others. This in itself conflicts greatly with her often childlike representation and we are forced to accept the woman behind the mask of innocence.Cort is likewise an interesting and complicated character. He grew up in a rather deprived part of the Louisiana swamps outside of New Orleans and after being \u2018put in his place\u2019 by the wealthy New Orleans clan he struck out on his own determined to return one day a true gentleman, both polished and civilized. He is ashamed of his dual natures choosing to ignore the werewolf inside of him, feeling it to be something barbaric and unclean. However, he comes to doubt this new sense of self when he meets Aria. She embraces that part of herself as well as luxuriating in her own less than extravagant up bringing. He is constantly conflicted between these two worlds as his head and his heart vary greatly in their desires. However, despite this inner tumult he is a devoted and loyal friend to those around him and has a humble charm that is appealing even when his stubbornness gets the better of him.Between these two, the chemistry is also wonderfully written. There is a rhythm to it with constant ebbs and flows that keep the reader on edge hoping to see the them finally come to their senses and embrace the love that we see so clearly. Constantly I was ensnared by the change of moods in the characters in this respect, eagerly waiting for the moments when they let their shields down and gave in to their inner desires.The writing style was also quite enjoyable. I loved the voices of the characters as well as the fluidity with which Krinard was able to switch point of views. It was nice being able to see inside the heads of the various characters and get a sense of them and the motives that drove them. She did a marvelous job making it an effortless change on the part of the reader and I was left not having to think about the change of tone or pace because I was instantly aware of the part I was reading. Therefore it was merely enlightening and interesting instead of tedious and annoying as most books can be when they institute this particular device. Overall, I really enjoyed this novel. While Historical Romance is not my typical genre I was really drawn into the story and intrigued by the characters. The slight addition of a paranormal twist making the characters werewolves was a definite plus for me, however I was left feeling it could have been explored a little more thoroughly. That said I definitely recommend this novel for any fan of the genre!"}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/382146-kathy", "userReview": "1882 - Cort Renier - wereworlf, born in the Bayou, fell in love with a rich Renier, she didn't want to marry him, he left his family, with the help of Yuri Chernikov he learned to be a gentleman and to supress his 'wolf', lucky at cards.

( Historical Werewolf # 7).This book is set in Victorian times and is about a girl/werewolf being raised by an old man from when she was a baby in a remote location. When she is 20 year old and with no knowledge of her parents or family, because the old man does not want to tell her,they set out on a journey from Europe to San Francisco and eventually to New Orleans to re unite her with her family. In the process the old man is killed and with him all the knowledge of who she is and why she is meeting her family now. She is rescued from an unpleasant situation by another werewolf, who has his own motives for helping her. There is mistaken identity, villains, double cross and a happy ever after ending. This is the first book I have read by this author.It was an Ok story, but I felt the story could have done with some better editing. This reader did not buy the story that an immature 20 year old werewolf/girl brought up in the wilderness would be able to fool anyone in Victorian Society to believe she was a Society Lady with only a short amount of time to learn the basics."}, {"userName": "Steph", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2142019-steph", "userReview": "Luck of the Wolf\n had a decent beginning introducing us to a female werewolf, Aria di Reinardus.

She is claiming to have amnesia ... things get a bit confusing from the point on unfortunately. Cort's friend, Yuri, recognizes Aria. He believes she just may be the missing heir to the throne of the Catarinia Werewolf Empire. He comes up with a plan to \"trade\" her back.I had hoped that, even with less than favorable reviews, this would be a decent read.

I couldn't understand the need to have Aria fake her amnesia or why her guardian, Frantz, would keep her so sheltered.I have not read any other books by Susan Krinard, but I am aware of other paranormal romance series she's written.

Revolutions. The shock of a nineteenth-century American city to a rural European girl. False identities within false identities. Court politics, rival houses, lost princesses. A commoner risen to the upper class, and a rogue Baron. The etiquette of civilised life, and the honesty of the wilderness. Love crossing social barriers, and loyalty to family and country pitched against romantic love. Greed, revenge, lust, love and honour, battling within one heart.There is certainly no shortage of good ideas in this historical supernatural romantic thriller. It's overloaded with them, but while one or two are used effectively in the story, the others just don't have justice done to them by the text, but float around without being satisfied. Despite that, the book seems to go on a bit too long. Either it needs to be simplified, or else structured, with some of the dramatic tensions being resolved before the end, leaving others to get the attention they deserve.

I wasn't thrilled with Aria and her secret keeping - I guess I understood it for awhile, but at some point - LONG before he knew the truth - she should have told the truth!Cochrane is the kind of bad guy you love to hate! Yuri is nasty in almost all circumstances! I do love that part of the plot. The shifter aspect of this story is different from most shifter stories, as most find it unappealing and wrong to shift. The whole \"Upper class\" thought pattern is wrong in so many ways for me.
