They not only are lost in the fog of grief, they are also left wondering where they should go from here ,- collectively and individually. And they each, in their own way, ask themselves: What exactly is the purpose of life and planning and dreaming if God can simply snatch it all away in the blink of an eye?For me, what could have been a very deep and powerful great read turned out to be a bit of a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it was a nice, uplifting, charitable read; the sort of story that brings a smile, invokes hope, and doesn't overtax the brain. And I'm all for that at Christmastime. However, it was simply too light and too unsubstantial to be taken altogether serious. Toss in the serendipitous love connections and it became all too cliche. At least, per my taste, that is. Chick-Lit fans will surely find the romantic elements endearingly charming. And that is a wonderful thing. Merry Christmas! May we all love broadly and pay kindness forward in our own unique ways.

This book is no exception. Five ladies have been a book club group for many years. Their friendships go beyond books and they have become supportive friends to one another. But all of this is somehow threatened when the one person that is the linchpin, Abby Wentworth, dies unexpectedly just before Christmas. The ladies get together to mourn Abby, open the Christmas gift she has left each of them, and to decide what they will do going forward. When they open the gifts, each finds an angel that Abby has painted to look very much like them. It leads them to decide that they will be \"earth angels\" for the month of December and each take on a project that will help someone else as Abby has helped them through troubled times. I loved the way each of the ladies used their particular gifts or talents and found the perfect project. What was particularly special was that the giver gained as much if not more than the receiver(s) of the gift that each of them gave. Each of their lives was enriched beyond measure and changed them into more caring, more loving, more grace filled women. Their perspectives and attitudes changed as well. Full of hope, love, and inspiration, this was a perfect Christmas read.

I had heard and read good reviews about Melody Carlson\u2019s The Christmas Angel Project and decided to give it a chance. I am so glad that I did, I absolutely loved it and wish the book in a way did not end. Abbey, Belinda, Louisa, Cassidy and Grace are five women (all different ages and walks of life) who for 15 years were in a bookclub. They all have gone through good times and bad together but suddenly the group of 5 goes down to 4. Abbey who as the women put it was the glue to the group passes away only weeks before Christmas. Abbey though leaves the women gifts of angel ornaments but each one is different. Each angel represents each woman and is special. Louisa who is the eldest in the group (my favorite character) thinks that maybe there is meaning in these angels. Abbey was an angel on earth to everyone who knew her and who met her. The women now feel that they should be earth angels but in secret to make it that much more meaningful. Louisa, lost her husband about a year ago and has had a hard time to get over it. She has always loved to paint but now that has become hard for her to do. Though, wanting to help others she volunteers her time and art supplies to the recreation center and starts an art therapy class. The class not only helps the seven in the group but it helps Louisa as well. Grace is a woman who if you saw her, you would think she had it all. She is very good at putting on an act and is all about appearances. Though in reality, things are not going well. Her husband Joel and her don\u2019t see eye to eye on rising their 19 year old twins. They don\u2019t have or make time to be together anymore and Grace usually bites off more than she can chew and blames Joel for it. Grace is an interior decorator and as her Angel Project, she has taken up doing 3 houses for families through Habitat for Humanity. Through the help of her friends and getting to know the 3 families personally (what they like, what they want and need) she is able to give them what they deserve right in time for Christmas. Belinda is a single mother of one daughter Emma. Belinda\u2019s husband left her when Emma was young and since than Belinda has given most of her time to her daughter and to her resale shop Glad Rags. Her angel project she decides to do is put on a fashion show at the high school her daughter use to go to and allow each participate to keep one outfit for free. The girls who go to the high school come from all walks of life and need positive motivation about themselves and how they dress. Belinda also, gives another chance at love with the principal. The part of their being introduced to each other is rather funny. Last but not least there is Cassidy. A woman who lost her parents when she was young. She has become a veterinarian and wants as her angel project to help those who can\u2019t afford or can\u2019t get around to the vet with their pets. She wants to be a mobile Vet Care and the people in her one client\u2019s place love the idea. Dorothy Morgan who is elderly and has a cat Mellie, just loves Cassidy and tries to set her up with her grandson Brent. Cassidy though as always had a hard time with men due to her figure and looks. But maybe just maybe he will see what lies inside Cassidy and not the appearance outside. I laughed, cried mostly, felt warm inside and the book really made me think about all that I have to be thankful to God for. It might be a Christmas themed book, though everyone should read this book if they are feeling down or just feel like they have nothing to offer this world. It makes you really thankful for the friends you have, don\u2019t take them for granted or that they will be here forever."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18944747-karen", "userReview": "An inspirational story about four friends whose mutual friend, Abby, encourages them even after her sudden passing.

Some have a magical \"Christmasy\" feel and some are simply good stories that occur during the Christmas season. Melody Carlson is an author whose novellas are always a joy to read.In The Christmas Angel Project I was anticipating something perhaps dealing with folks finding a tree decorated with paper angels which has the name, gender, and age and size of a child for whom folks can purchase and provide a gift for Christmas. This was definitely not the case in this story. As you can see from the back-cover intro to the book, it is about four ladies in a book club who lose a beloved member of the group quite suddenly and just before the holiday season. What I found interesting is that each of the ladies comes from a different walk of life, a different stage of life, and has different perspectives. They all have quirks of personality and emotional and societal needs quite different from each other. While a short little read, it had a longer-book feel to it. Of the four ladies, I found it difficult to pick the one I liked best. I felt that Cassidy and especially Grace were somewhat complainers. I liked Louisa but she kind of had to grow on me. Belinda might be my \"most favorite\" of the four ladies.I liked the fact that two of the ladies connected with a gentleman for a potential romantic relationship. Very above board and clean. And one of the ladies' rocky marriage seems to have a lift.But perhaps I'm giving too much of the story away.A good read.I received a complimentary copy as a participant in the Baker Publishing Group's review program."}, {"userName": "Leslie M.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35473206-leslie-m", "userReview": "Abby, Belinda, Louisa, Grace, and Cassidy have been \u201cbook group\u201d friends for some time.

And here's why - if you know me well, you know that I'm not really a very religious person? I grew up in a Christian family going to Christian school, and while I don't have a relationship with God in my adult life I can still respect that there are members of my family who do. That being said, I also think that people can be quick to disregard things if they get the label of being \"Christian\". In fact, sometimes I am one of those people, worried that the books might come off to preachy for me. So my goal this year is to read more books that have Christian content in an attempt to end the stigma - at least for myself.So my first pick this year was The Christmas Angel project, and I picked it with my Grandma in mind. She's such a sweetheart, and she's obsessed with angels, and she always calls me her angel. Seeing as I didn't get a chance to make it home this year for Christmas, I figured it's something that would make me feel closer to her.The Christmas Angel Project is the story of 5 women who are close friends and have a book club together. One morning they wake up to the news that one of their friends has passed away. Abby was the glue that held the girls together, and her unexpected death has the women feeling like the end of the book club is near. Each woman has her own struggles, and all were able to find hope and confidence in Abby.The women meet one last time to exchange an unexpected gift from their departed friends, and instead find inspiration to keep their group going. They will become Christmas angels and give back to the community this holiday season with Abby in their hearts, meeting every week to share their progress and lean on one another.Admittedly, this book had a bit more of a religious aspect then most books I would normally choose to read, but I knew that going in. All four women are relying on God and their faith to show them the way and to help them find the answers to their problems. And as someone who is more spiritual than religious, it wasn't something that I could relate to, really. However, the overall aspect of giving back to the community and helping one another is still something I can appreciate, and I feel like overall, that's the important thing about this book (at least for me).This was my first read by Carlson, and I really enjoyed the writing style of the novel. Very colorful descriptions without being overly taxing. The characters were well thought out. I liked how unique each woman was and the diversity. Their problems were every day life struggles - one was having difficulties with her husband, one was struggling with the death of her husband, one was struggling with her self-esteem, and another was failing to put herself out in the dating world. They're very mundane problems, but their also things that we all struggle with and the way that Carlson dealt with these issues made for good reading.Although a heartwarming read, this book is a little bit too good to be true. Everything plays out as it should so we can get the happily ever after, and it's Christmastime so I'm going to cut this novel some slack. It's a very light read. Definitely chick-lit feels, and you could sit down and finish it in one sitting.I definitely feel like this is going to be more of an enjoyable read around Christmastime, so the next time you're looking for something to get you into the holiday spirit, look no further.Read more reviews on Bibliotique."}, {"userName": "Melody", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33669615-melody", "userReview": "When I first read the synopsis of this book, the premise had me hooked. However, I'm a bit disappointed by how it turned out. The story is very enjoyable and different from any other Christmas story I read. The faith thread is also strong and brings readers a lot of hope and some much needed wisdom. Unfortunately, three of the four main characters felt a little one dimensional for me. I didn't get to know them as much as I would have liked... They didn't come to life as we only got to see one aspect of their lives. Also, the romance elements seemed a little too good to be true, especially the ending to Cassidy's story.Overall, this is a light and enjoyable Christmas read.

I look forward to reading these every year, and this one, THE CHRISTMAS ANGEL PROJECT, was one of her best. The idea of the four ladies becoming Earth Angels after the death of their best friend was unique. Grace is married, but her marriage is struggling. Her children are flunking out of college, her husband is a slob, she wants her house showcase ready and he wants it lived in. When offered a chance to decorate Habitat homes for Christmas she jumped at the chance, not realizing that she'd have to supply the furniture and decorations herself. Financially, she can't afford that, but she decides to trust God for the details. Louise is mourning two losses, both her husband and now her best friend. She is an artist and decides to be an artist therapy instructor, getting people, through art, to talk about their losses. An unique idea I love. Cassidy is a part time vet. She discovers her angel mission when she learns a lot of pets belonging to people on fixed incomes don't get medical care. She pays for the care of one cat herself, and discovers a whole opportunity. However, her boss wants nothing to do with it and threatens to fire her. Answers come in unexpected ways for Cassidy. Belinda is a bitter divorced lady who owns a swanky second hand store. She is offered the opportunity to volunteer as a fashion adviser for middle school girls. She discovers she has amazing opportunities there, both as a volunteer hairstylist, a makeup artist, and a body type fashion adviser. Plus a hot middle school principal is a plus. These four ladies, all best friends to the deceased, connect with each other. I loved all four of the individual stories, and not sure who I connected with the most. Maybe there's a part of me that is a portion of all of these ladies. I'm married with a few children not living up to their potential. I am mourning the loss of very dear family members. I understand fixed income retirees. And I can find amazing clothes for the family at thrift stores though none of them offer the services Belinda does! If you love Christmas stories you will want to read THE CHRISTMAS ANGEL PROJECT. Maybe it will inspire you to find your unique, God-given gift, and use it to bless others. For Melody Carlson, it's writing heartwarming Christmas stories. Don't miss this novella -- a great gift for yourself, the church or city library, and a friend."}, {"userName": "Julia Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29770295-julia-wilson", "userReview": "The Christmas Angel Project by Melody Carlson is a delightful festive offering. It has love, warmth and a strong focus on God's plans for life.God's plans are greater than our own. When we try to do things in our strength, we stumble along. \"He wants to direct your path - if you just take the time to listen.\" Handing the reins over to God takes the pressure off us as we surrender to Him.Prayer is of vital importance. \"It was a pathetic and desperate prayer but it was heartfelt.\" Prayer is not about being eloquent. Prayer is about being honest and being real.The Christmas Angel Project has the theme of grief and loss. The death of a loved one is painful. We never understand it and we may get angry with God. God wants us to be real with Him. We need to deal with loss in whatever way we can.The novel shows the value of friendship. There are five friends who have met in a book club for years. They are all different but their friendship binds them together. They have different skills and different needs but all support each other.Love and kindness are twin themes in the book. \"Abby lived out God's love and goodness.\" With so much hurt and trouble, the world needs kindness. A community needs kindness and giving of oneself with no thought to any reward. Kindness can be contagious and can be paid forward.Melody Carlson within the novel demonstrates that God can use everyone. If you still have a pulse, you can be useful doing kingdom work. No-one is too young or too old to be used by God.I absolutely love Melody Carlson's Christmas books. Every year a new one appears that I cannot wait to get my hands on.

They're always feel-good stories. They're almost fairy tales that start out bad but end with a Happily-Ever-After. And, The Christmas Angel Project is no exception.Abby Wentworth's small book group had been meeting for fifteen years. She started it, and the four other members helped her through a rough period when she won her battle against ovarian cancer. But, the kindergarten teacher was still only in her forties when she died the day after Thanksgiving. It comes as a shock to all of her friends. Louisa, Abby's oldest friend, was still mourning the death of her husband. Belinda saw Abby as her best friend, and she's just angry at God. For Grace, her marriage, kids and career all seem off-track, and now she's lost Abby. And, Cassidy, the youngest of the group, is a veterinarian who suffers from a poor self-image. Abby was too young to be her mother, but she was her mother-figure and her support. All four women agree it's time to give up the group because they can't go on without Abby.But, Abby left them all gifts, personalized gifts. It was if she knew she wouldn't be there, and they would all need one more boost. Together, and separately, the four women would take Abby's gift as a sign to keep going, maybe with a change here or there. The changes were inspired by Abby's words of wisdom, quotes from the Bible. And, each of Abby's friends would take it to heart. There would be more than one Christmas miracle.Carlson's Christmas stories are always slight books with little space for great character development. Even so, she gives enough about the four women that the reader truly cares as to whether or not they're able to succeed. Without spoiling the story, I can just say each woman finds blessings in the Christmas season. Carlson's The Christmas Angel Project is another sweet story with a message, just what her readers have come to expect for the season."}, {"userName": "Christian Fiction Addiction", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7431278-christian-fiction-addiction", "userReview": "T'is the season to grab a Christmas-themed book, curl up with a hot drink and let the snow fly while you are whisked away to another world! If you read one book this Christmas season, I encourage you to read Melody Carlson's tender read, \"The Christmas Angel Project\". I quite enjoyed the cast of characters that we are introduced to in this story, as Grace, Cassidy, Belinda and Louisa seek to walk through their grief of losing their close friend Abby. Although the novel is not that long, Carlson has succeeded at fleshing each character out to the point that you get a good sense of who they are and can sympathize with each one's situation. I have read other stories where characters get bogged down in their grief and the story suffers as a result, but such is not the situation with \"The Christmas Angel Project\". Rather, the gifts that Abby offers enable the characters to find meaning in their suffering, and see that God's hand is with them and is able to bring good out of their loss. As a result, this Christmas-themed read contains a profound message that can uphold us through the darkest times of the year. As a male reader, I would have liked to see more of how Abby's husband experienced his grief and found hope in his pain as I felt I was left hanging a bit. However, I can appreciate how Carlson was trying to focus on these women's stories and was writing to a target audience, and she definitely succeeds there.Wandering through the pages of \"The Christmas Angel Project\" will inspire you to look beyond yourself and see how you can bless others this Christmas. If you are looking for a book to encourage you, entertain you, and to put you in the Christmas spirit, then this may just be what you are looking for!

This book follows 4 women who are grieving the loss of their close friend and decide to become \u201cangels\u201d and do special things for those in need. Each woman is struggling with something and learns something through their experience.I liked the relationships between the women. They were all very supportive of each other and helped each other through their times of need. Each characters personality was unique and they were very well developed. I also liked the lessons that were learned along the way.I wish the story would have focused a bit more on Christmas, everything happens in the days leading up to Christmas but it\u2019s not a very \u201cChristmasy\u201d story. The story was also very predictable at times and I found the pacing to be slow.Overall this was an okay story but I don\u2019t see myself revisiting it in the future.My Rating: 3 starsI received this book from Baker Publishing Group in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Katrina Epperson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22452806-katrina-epperson", "userReview": "I loved this book!It evoked both smiles and tears for me.

The Christmas Angel Project has a gloomy start which sharply contrasts with the feel-good uplifting ending. Four women at personal crossroads are crushed when a dear friend dies unexpectedly. Cassidy, Grace, Belinda and Louisa are all facing challenging Christmases and the future looks bleak without Abby's supportive listening ear and gentle understanding to help them through. What follows is a touching story that transforms not only this diverse group of women but the reader as well. And there's even a touch or two of sweet romance! The perfect read to direct your focus to what really matters this special season...and throughout the whole year.

The book started off just fine - interesting premise for the Christmas angel project. What set me back is that it comes out fairy tale like. While it isdesirable to have upbeat stories this just doesn't feel plausible. Unless there is that long sought love fulfilled it seems that no one can be happy. Romance is fine but how contrived that in 2 of the 4 friends their projects lead them toTrue love. How rewarding it would be to just choose to do something self giving without entangling the romantic edge. Maybe it is the lack of character development that leaves the reader feeling shortchanged - the book on the superficial side. It was a nice feel good read but would like toSee more depth."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7426892-angela", "userReview": "This is a charming story of five book club friends whose main connection is friend Abby.
