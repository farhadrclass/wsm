This is the best one I've read to date! Rich in historical detail and vivid descriptions you will feel as if you are there with Laurel Tracey and Sergeant Thomas Baker. Laurel has the hardship of trying to run a 100 acre ranch on her own. Knowing she is unable to do it she buys a prisoner for a years time to work her land and protect her from squatters on her land. Thomas Baker is what some would call a hard man, unflinching,uncaring. After all he has been through who could blame him. When he was just a child there was an Indian raid on his home. His father told him to go in the crawl space under his house and not come out no matter what he heard and he heard plenty. He heard the killing of his brother,mother and father. It turned him bitter. Having no one to care for him he wanders about until he is old enough to join up and fight. Taking risks no one else will because he has no one to care about him he advances fast and moves up the ranks. He lands in jail when he can't pay off a debt.On Laurel's ranch he swears to work it and protect her. There is danger around every corner there and it has Laurel scared. She is respectful and kind to him and he feels undeserving of it. He may be a hard man and have seen bloodshed in the war but he would never let any harm come to Laurel,he would lay down his life to protect her. Historical romance at it's best with a hint of danger in the suspense.The title is so perfect for this book, An Uncommon Protector, that is exactly what Thomas Baker is. He goes above and beyond. I hope this book is next on your to buy list as it's simply a do not miss book!Excellent,excellent book. I look forward to reading many more books by Shelley Shepard Gray.I highly recommend this to fans of Historical Romantic fiction.Pub Date 07 Feb 2017 Thank you to NetGalley and Zondervan Fiction for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Marlene", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27110787-marlene", "userReview": "It seems like I don\u2019t give many solid five-star ratings. This is largely because I don\u2019t round my ratings up. I always round down, because I know I tend to be more generous than many other reviewers - and because I want to be able to see at a glance on Goodreads which books I have actually given five stars to! So I\u2019m impressed that I\u2019ve given both this book and the first in the series five stars. Good job, Shelley Shepard Gray! An Uncommon Protector (Zondervan, 2017), second in the  Lone Star Hero series by  Shelley Shepard Gray, is a Christian historical romantic suspense set in Texas in 1867 with occasional flashbacks to 1865 Johnson\u2019s Island in Ohio. The novel is a standalone story, but I\u2019d still recommend starting with book #1, \n A Loyal Heart\n. I chose An Uncommon Protector from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review, because I enjoyed the first book so much. Rating: 5 starsThe hero: Sergeant Thomas Baker, is one of a close knit group of officers who were imprisoned together at a Confederate Officers POW Camp. These men were first introduced in A Loyal Heart: the highly respected Captain Monroe, Major Ethan Kelly, Lieutenant Robert Truax, and Lieutenant Phillip Markham. They were \u201csome of the finest men he\u2019d ever met.\u201d They take their friendship with each other very seriously, keeping in touch with a strong commitment to be there for one another. While in the POW camp, Thomas tended to chafe against the Union guards. His \u201cmouth always had gotten him into trouble,\u201d ever since his family died. As a child, his father ordered him to hide during a Comanche attack, and Thomas\u2019s family was wiped out. \u201cNever again would he follow instructions he didn\u2019t agree with.\u201d Then as he grew up, he\u2019d \u201cconstantly had to fight and scrape to survive.\u201d However, Thomas \u201csure wasn\u2019t the type to sit around and feel sorry for himself.\u201d The heroine: Laurel Tracey is an orphan. Her father and brother died in the war, and her mother succumbed to influenza a few years later. Red Roan Ranch is now Laurel\u2019s, and she is alone in the world except for two mooching step-siblings. She \u201cwas attempting to run what was left of a pitiful cattle operation with barely twenty head, little money for alfalfa for them to graze on, and far too many squatters in the area. She was exhausted and beginning to think she was never going to be able to keep the ranch going.\u201d Laurel is in serious need of help. \u201cShe liked her ranch. She wanted to keep it, wanted to live there.\u201d Laurel and Thomas cross paths when he is one of a group of prisoners \u201cserving short jail terms for minor infractions,\u201d assigned to fix her fence as a charitable deed. \u201cThere was something about the man that had caught her regard and held on tight.\u201d In a brief conversation, she learns that that he is eligible for release the following day if someone hires him as an indentured servant for a year. And that\u2019s just what she does, figuring it\u2019s a good investment of her limited funds.Christian elements: I\u2019ve listed just a few quotes. Faith is strong in the story but not flaunted. I didn\u2019t see anything that concerned me. *Laurel: \u201cLet\u2019s believe him\u2026 It\u2019s the Christian thing to do.\u201d *Thomas: \u201dI am hard. But because of that, I\u2019ve learned to reach out to our Lord. I\u2019m a man who needs all the help he can get.\u201d *Of Thomas: \u201cHe\u2019d learned along time ago to stop feeling guilty about the past and concentrate on looking forward. That was his chief survival skill.\u201d What I liked: *I like that Thomas is a flawed character, but the reader sees his heart and sees him grow, and it is so easy to root for him. Laurel is a lovely character inside and out and is very brave, but she is also vulnerable. I always enjoy a hero and heroine who so obviously fit each other so well. Also, they\u2019re definitely drawn to each other, but the romance is not rushed, which makes sense for their positions as employer and indentured servant. *I enjoyed the following exchange, which simultaneously acknowledges that Thomas\u2019s presence is outside of societal norms and provides a justification for it. And the comeuppance of an obnoxious character is fun, too.Laurel\u2019s step-brother: \u201cYou being here is already ruining her reputation.\u201d Thomas: \u201cIt very well might be. But she will be safe with me.\u201d What I didn\u2019t like: I could only find two very minor issues. An odd use of the word rectify (in my opinion) and a discrepancy about Thomas\u2019s age. Thomas was 22 in 1865, he is still 22 in 1867, and it\u2019s mentioned again later that he\u2019s 22 in 1867. Oops! Perhaps that has been fixed, as I read an eARC. Not enough to bring this book down from five stars, though. If Shelley Shepard Gray writes any more books in this series, they will be auto-reads for me. (I am really hoping there will be a novel for each of the military friends.) As the rest of the author\u2019s books under this pseudonym appear to be Amish stories (which I avoid), I plan to dip my toes into her Westerns under the pseudonym  Shelley Gray. So I\u2019ve put her Chicago World\u2019s Fair Mystery series on my to-read list. I highly recommend this book to any fan of Christian historical romantic suspense. As I said earlier, the faith elements are not flaunted. They are so integrated into the characters that I think this book would also appeal to non-Christians."}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11909124-staci", "userReview": "Shelley Shepard Gray knows how to weave a solid post Civil War love story.In An Uncommon Protector, Laurel is trying to save her ranch.

I have not read the first, and completely enjoyed and understood this one. Now that I know some of the backstory and characters, I really want to read the first book.This book takes place in Texas after the Civil War. Many women are widows and fatherless, Laurel falls into this category. She is trying to keep her family ranch up and running while finding a lot of opposition. Her step-siblings are leeches and want her to sell so they can have fund, there are other ranchers trying to get hold of the property. She is a strong and determined young lady who sees an opportunity to hire and ex-convict to help her run off the unsavory characters around her.Fortunately for her, the ex-convict is a man of integrity.

Thomas Baker, while a bit rough around the edges, is loyal to the core, and when his new boss Laurel Tracey needs his help, he freely gives it. Moreover, he realizes they will need more help than just the two of them can give, so he calls upon his friends - also former soldiers, who are willing to help at almost a moments notice.Laurel, though still a woman of her time, is determined to keep her ranch and her family legacy intact. Others seek to use the fact that she is a woman alone to their advantage. Though she finds it uncomfortable to go against what society dictates, she is willing to do it for her ranch and for her very life.An Uncommon Protector is a good story. Not great for me, but good. The plot is engaging, and the characters are the best part, in my opinion. The romance is where things fell a bit flat. It moves way too fast for my preference in a story and lacks any build-up whatsoever. Other readers may not mind this as much, but it's usually a sticking point with me. I also like more historical details in a story, and this one is very light in that regard.Still, it's a sweet romance, and while they weren't my new favorite couple, I did still like Laurel and Thomas together. I do want to read book three at some point, to finally get a story that focuses on Major Kelly because he's still my favorite out of the four friends.Thank you to the publisher for a complimentary copy of this novel.

This book includes a band of brothers who swore a promise to each other in a prisoner of war camp to come to each other's aid should the need arise. The hero was a tough guy who was so tender and protective of Laurel. She was a sweet but determined heroine who trusted a convict and prisoner of war to help her save her ranch and keep her safe.

The chemistry between these two is palpable and electric from the instant their eyes first meet and just gets better as their story progresses. Both protagonists already have compelling backstories that give dimension to their characters, and the way these stories are presented \u2013 as well as the growth that each experiences along the way \u2013 makes these two of my favorite of Gray\u2019s characters!Bottom Line: An Uncommon Protector is a story bursting with everything western romance fans are looking for. Bits of intriguing history woven throughout, fantastic characters, humor, sincerity, and some sizzle too! Enhancing the story even further is a bit of mystery/suspense that keeps tensions high (and brings out Thomas\u2019 protective side quite nicely) as well as the message of redemption and \u201cvalue\u201d that is subtle but also clear and sweet.

I didn't read the first book A Loyal Heart and had no trouble following along with this book. I mostly read Ms. Gray's Amish series, but have read one of her historicals in the past so decided to give this one a try. It has an interesting premise. Single girl losing ranch so she hires a convict (when he's release on (sort of) parole or really sold on the auction block) to work for her to save the ranch. When Laurel brings Thomas home, her step-siblings rebel, attempting to call her bluff, and with no money or place to stay, walked eight miles to town. Laurel let them go. I didn't like the step-siblings at all. I did like Thomas' outspokenness, though he was inappropriate much of the time, and I'm glad he was a man of honor even if he did have a rather low opinion of himself. Laurel is learning to be outspoken, so she is struggling to find the fine footing between being a genteel lady and being owner of a ranch and forced to make her own decisions for herself and others.Ms. Gray isn't real big on faith messages, her books are more sweet romances with little to no mention of faith, so this book shouldn't be offensive to anyone (even if they are anti-Christian). If you like a strong faith message, look further, but if you like sweet romances, then Ms. Gray is a writer to consider. Her books are fun, imagitive, and light-hearted.

I picked it up on the \"new\" shelf at the library. After I started it I realized it was book two in A Lone Star Hero's Love Story. But it was certainly enjoyable as a stand alone. I was conflicted on how to review this book because there were a few parts I just didn't feel worked for me for example, Laural Tracey's position on the ranch. Supposedly she has been running the ranch all alone for a few years, but when she hires Thomas she seems to be almost helpless. If I remember right, Laural and Thomas are both 22 but they seemed years older, which in a way makes sense because of what all they had been through but then again in seemed a little off to me. The other thing that bothers me is that Thomas was sleeping in the house the second night he was there. It was hard for me to wrap my brain around that because of the time period. But I tried to put those things aside and started to enjoy it. The hero, Thomas was refreshing. He is different from most other wounded, flawed heroes. And Laural was okay, I didn't connect as much as I would have liked to. I did appreciate how well the story line moved along and didn't seem to drag out the romance for months.

Soon he realises he\u2019d do just about anything to see Laurel safe, happy and more than anything - protected. I had previously read the first book in this series, A Loyal Heart and really enjoyed it. This was a simpler tale - but no less romantic or worthy of my time. Laurel and Thomas were well likable characters and while their story may not have had as many twists and turns as the previous book - I would still heartily recommend as a cosy read, perfect for reading on a wet windy day. \u2028Can\u2019t wait for more from this series."}, {"userName": "Brittany", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18727044-brittany", "userReview": "An Uncommon Protector is a great addition to the Lone Star Hero collection. The stories in this series can stand alone. Each story contains a hero who was part of a group of Confederate POW soldiers. These men formed an incredible bond that proved to be strong even after the war was over and these stories took place. The bond between these men provided the common link between the stories. I liked both the main story and the flashbacks to the POW camp. Those flashbacks helped me understand how Thomas viewed himself within the group.This novel was really enjoyable to read. It had danger, vile characters, sweet and tender romance, and hope. I really liked both main characters. Laurel was a strong woman, yet she learned when to ask for help and rely on others. Thomas had to overcome a lot in his life. Even in this book he had growing to do, yet he was a strong and loyal defender.This story was a joy to read from start to finish and I definitely recommend it to fans of historical fiction set around the civil war era.I received a complimentary copy of this book.

Thomas and Laurel come together after Thomas' indenture to Laurel for a year to help him leave prison. Thomas is a former Confederate soldier who has a quick tongue, but loyal, and has integrity to help others and work hard. His past, the death of his parents and hard scrabble existence as a young man on his own, let him to be very independent, but loyal to those who become his family. Laurel is fighting her step-siblings and a former suitor to build up her ranch, and keep her home. They combine together to help the ranch, but as circumstance escalate, to save it and themselves from villains intent on scaring Laurel off the ranch. Loved the flashbacks into Thomas' life and his prison experiences. Both of them are genuine, honest characters, with sincere and honest hearts. I loved their mutual attraction. Laurel was more 'sweet', but definitely still hard working and willing to work and fight for her home. I can't say it was a perfect period piece, but definitely a fun read for me today. This was a cute read, but still a little deeper read for the subject matter with the Prison scenes. The secondary characters were a little flat for me, so really a 3.5, but will round up to 4 with the depth of the feelings and emotions that were portrayed with the war/prison elements. I will be reading other things by this author to see some of the other side stories from this group of Civil War Soldiers.Romance, clean, mild Christian elements. I received a copy from NetGalley in exchange for a fair and honest review."}, {"userName": "Kelly Bridgewater", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33835690-kelly-bridgewater", "userReview": "After reading Shelley Shepard Gray's Chicago World's Fair Mystery series and being pleased with two out of three of them, I had a good idea of how Gray writes. She invites me into the historical setting with no problem. I could picture the setting and see the characters moving around. I understood the character's plight and emotions. While the story is predictable and non-original, I did like the hero who was a \"bad\" guy turned right, even though I believe his crime that put him in prison wasn't that horrible. Since it is a historical romance, I knew right away that Laurel and Thomas would fall in love and end up married. While the plot idea of someone wanting to scare Laurel off her hundred acres has been overdone, I did enjoy the time I spent reading the story. Once the bad guy was revealed to Laurel and Thomas, it was a quick hand trick and the bad guy was hauled off to jail. I hoped for a better stand-off, but Gray didn't give me one. An Uncommon Protector is a great book for fans of historical romances right after the Civil War. While I prefer to read something with more suspense in it, Gray does a good job at weaving together a story that I enjoyed.I received a complimentary copy of An Uncommon Protector from Zondervan Publishing and the opinions stated are all my own"}, {"userName": "Julia Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29770295-julia-wilson", "userReview": "An Uncommon Protector by Shelley Shepard Gray is a marvellous Christian historical romance, set in the aftermath of the American Civil war. I absolutely loved it.War changes people - for better or for worse. Bonds of brothers formed in hardship, persist in peacetime, united by shared memories and promises. Women and children suffered. Men did unthinkable things. Some people still believed in goodness. \"She still believed in goodness in the world, even though she had survived a war.\"War can make or break people, freeing them from their past. In times of crisis, men turned to God. \"I realise how much they have to be thankful for and they count their blessings.Conflicts continue to rage even though war has ended. Greed drives men forwards, when really they should be thankful for all they have.There is the theme of loss. Characters who have lost their whole families still have a drive to survive. God promises to repay the years the locusts have taken.War leaves scars. Some are visible, others are hidden deep inside.There is a wonderful air of love and care that pervades the novel. Whilst some will let us down, others will always have our backs.Kindness is over the whole novel. The leading lady is kindness personified. If she can alleviate suffering with a kind word or action, she will. Shelley Shepard Gray has drawn wonderful characters once again. Her heroine is a mixture of strong yet vulnerable. In her kindness, she will not suffer fools gladly. Likewise, the leading man is a mixture too. His past has made him self reliant and reluctant to let others in. His past has also made him the caring man, the reader sees. The pair have a wonderful volley of dialogue backwards and forwards.I always adore Shelley Shepard Gray's novels and An Uncommon Protector is one of her finest. For a real treat - buy it and read it today.I received this book for free. A favourable review was not required and all views expressed are my own."}, {"userName": "Just Commonly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19895197-just-commonly", "userReview": "There is just something about A Lone Star Hero's Love Story series by Shelley Shepard Gray. Book 1, The Loyal Heart had captured my heart, and in the second book of the series, An Uncommon Protector we are once again thrown into a story of how war had affected and change people. And before we get to that, lets talk about our main characters, Thomas Baker and Laurel Tracey. Boy oh boy! Thomas Baker is one worthy hero. Rakishly handsome and with a grin that can heat through the pages to our fingers, Thomas Baker is loyal and honest, sometimes with humorous or embarrassing results. Either way, you will fall in love with him. Yet, we can't forget the partner in this uncommon love story, Laurel. She is tenacious and strong-willed. From their first encounter to the last scene of the story, their chemistry is spot on. We will not find a better pair in this story than them (though I'm really loving the banters between the team - we'll get to that in a bit). As a couple, they may be my favorite set from all the stories the author (that I've read so far). I do need to check back on another favorite of mine and confirm this claim. Speaking of characters, we have the camaraderie of the men's unit under Captain Devin's promise pact.\"What kind of men were they? What kind of men dropped everything and rode miles and miles on the basis of one telegram? Men unlike any she'd ever known.\" (225)So true it is, and that's what truly struck me with this series. There's friendship, the type that highlights loyalty in all caps, but it's much more than that. It's a promise, a promise that held true to each of these men's hearts, and in turn representative of the promise from our Lord to us. The mystery aspect was interesting, and had provided the catalyst for the story to move forward, and the chance for us to see our main characters get to know each other, and for us to meet the rest of the unit again. I am so looking forward to Major Kelly and Captain Devin's story! I love how the author easily woven in a little background of the unit, Thomas' and Laurel's backstory and bring forth the story as a whole. In all, a wonderful Book 2 in a series, that can easily be read as a standalone. I really enjoyed An Uncommon Protector, and even more so than book 1, The Loyal Heart!One of my favorite scenes:\"Miss Tracey, I would have paid good money to have you at my side when I gave Thomas orders during the war. Your presence would have saved us form many hours watching him pace and fidget.\" (228)This review first appeared on Just Commonly blog.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the author/publisher.

The War Between the States was hard on Lauren Tracey. She loses her mother, father, and her brother. She has inherited a 200 acre ranch-a ranch she is running alone. She decides to free Thomas Baker from jail and hires him for a year to help her on the ranch. The two have to solve a mystery of why her cattle are suddenly dying. Could they find that their own lives are in danger?I thought An Uncommon Protector to be a pretty good read. I liked Lauren from the start and enjoyed the chemistry between her and Thomas. Even though Thomas was just released from jail, I still felt that he was a good man. He would do anything to protect Lauren, making me love him more and more throughout the book. The story is full of historical details that I felt like I was transported back in time. There are some mystery and suspense that kept me wondering what would happen next.

The main characters are Laurel Tracey and Thomas Baker. Thomas was introduced in the first book of the series, The Loyal Heart. The flashbacks take place in Ohio in a Confederate soldier prison camp toward the end of the Civil War.Thomas Baker has really done it this time. He was caught in a poker game with men much more experienced than himself. As a result, he owed them a lot of money that he didn\u2019t have; therefore, he was put in jail. He now faces more jail time unless someone is willing to buy him for one year to work as an employee. He has no hope for that, but understands he got himself in this situation.Laurel Tracey is a lone female trying to hold on to the family ranch after the deaths of her father and brother in the Civil War and her mother\u2019s death as well. She has two ungrateful stepsiblings who are living with her and taking her for every dime she has without doing any work around the ranch. She desperately needs some help or she will be forced to sell the ranch, which is just what her stepsiblings want. Her neighbor also wants her to sell and has offered to buy the ranch or he could marry her to help her out. Laurel is determined to keep her ranch and thus determines to hire an employee, who just happens to be a former prisoner. Thomas comes to work at the ranch and immediately he and Laurel sense an attraction to each other. That very day, however, trouble starts on the ranch. After a few days, Thomas realizes he is in over his head and calls for help from his former Confederate soldier comrades.I really liked how Thomas leaned on the Lord throughout his whole life, even when he admittedly made some very poor choices. He still considered himself a Christian and didn\u2019t falter in his belief in God. I also liked the interaction between Laurel and Thomas. They always tried to do what was best for the other and also what was best in God\u2019s eyes. Thomas definitely showed his protectiveness for Laurel as she was protective of him. They both were protective of the ranch and also recognized they were protected by the Lord.
