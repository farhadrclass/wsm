Being found over a dead body is not good news for Harlow and she finds herself needing to regain her strength and discover who is now killing in the hospital she'd found as an escape. Fish Out of Water is a bit of a fantasy mixed with mystery/thriller along with a side of romance, yes sign me up for this one please. This is one of those novellas that when I finished reading I just think wow, now that is how you pack a good story into a short read. This one has a complexity to the characters and the fantasy elements that you wouldn't think you could get into a short read and still have a plot that is entertaining. The story was fast paced as it needed to be being shorter but it also gave enough depth to the world and character building to make it a very interesting read.

If you've read the series, you know that Harlow Bevans, a changeling mermaid who was once a consultant to the Eastern Conclave, was possessed by the psychotic fae serial killer Charybdis. He took control over her body and shattered her mind. As the story picks up, Harlow is a patient at the Edelweiss Mental Institution where things are supposed to be peaceful allowing for healing. One night, her door is left open and Harlow finds herself being lured to the scene of a dead boy. Harlow once hauled body parts out of lakes and rivers and streams for the Conclave, but they have since washed their hands of her. It is now time for Harlow to do something for herself, even if that means working alongside a curious character named Carter Lam. Lam is a nice guy filled with his own secrets and they work well together to uncover a dark mystery.\"Let's go make classic horror movie mistakes!\" LamFinally, some resolution to what happened to one of my favorite characters, Harlow. Plus, we get yet another update on another character, Bianca, a warg who was last seen in Camille's last installment.Overall, satisfactory."}, {"userName": "Angela (Angel's Guilty Pleasures)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7742509-angela-angel-s-guilty-pleasures", "userReview": "Hot Dame! This novella was so good! Just look at that cover. It depicts Harlow perfectly!Fish Out of Water is a novella featured in the Gemini/Black Dog world. You don\u2019t have to have read the Gemini series to understand \nFish Out of Water,\n but it might help give you more content and understanding on some things. Harlow is introduced to us in the Gemini series. At the end she\u2019s in a bad way and is in Edelweiss trying to find her footing again or at least come to terms with what happened to her. Harlow is starting to wake up. One of things that helps pull her out is the strange things going on at Edelweiss, murder and mystery. She\u2019s tossed into the middle of this dangerous mess. Then the other thing is Lam; he\u2019s nice and has secrets. I like the blossoming romance between these two. (I hope we get more from both of them.) This story takes of from the first page and we are dragged off into a mystery. It\u2019s a non-stop flurry of adventure. I LOVE this world. It's so much fun to return and see some of the secondary characters play a more permanent role.

It perfectly rounds off the traumatic events that Harlow went through in the Gemini trilogy with her possession by the evil Charybdis, this story gives her focus to deal with what happened to her as well as finishing the story of Bianca, the warg, that was briefly touched on during the Gemini series and the death of her mate as well as her pregnancy at the time..... it was lovely to hear what happened to her after she was shipped off to have the baby.Obviously the star of this novella is Harlow, the changeling mermaid but sadly for her the book is often stolen by her new co-star Carter Lam and his naughty antics, that boy is full of character and a wonderful addition to the Black Dog world. The burgeoning romance between the pair is so sweet and tender it's delicious!The world-building of the Black Dog world is fantastic as always and every book adds a little more to the mythos and as per usual Hailey's writing is gripping.... in this case it was so gripping I demolished the book in a single sitting. Wonderful book and wonderful writing!I would recommend this book to one and all but especially if you are a fan of the books already as it is a must read book in my opinion and I cannot wait to see what else comes Harlow and Carter's way!"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/251943-kelly", "userReview": "Oh my goodness, this novella was so good. Harlow was in a bad way after her run in with Charybdis and she's in Edelweiss trying to find her footing again. Or at least come to terms with what she did while she was under Charybdis's control. She's a mess, but she's not nearly as much a mess as she thinks. Being pulled into the middle of the strange goings-on at Edelweiss helps shock her back into herself. While she's not the carefree woman she was before her possession, the Harlow who lived life loud and with joy is still in there and she's waking up.One of the things that wakes her up is Lam. He's nice to look at and he makes her feel things that aren't all doom and gloom. Except Lam has his own set of secrets and they could end up hurting Harlow in the end unless he can control himself. (I believe in him. I BELIEVE!)The murders are messy and dangerous. Harlow is tossed into the middle of something dark without the means to defend herself, but she has more skills than most give her credit for.I'm LOVING being back in this world and seeing how things turn out for some of the tertiary characters we've met before. *draws glitter hearts around everyone and smiles like a sap* What can I say?

Mermaid changing, Harlow Bevans is spending some time in the Edelweiss Mental Institution after Charybdis took possession of her body and committed uncountable heinous acts. Harlow was no more than a hitchhiker in her own body-forced to watch as Charybdis hurt and killed countless people and stalked her friend, Cam.Harlow is trying to cope with the trauma that she experienced when she is pulled into a series of brutal murders occurring at the mental institution. She is one of the few people who can hear the serial killer's haunting song that lures her to the scene of the first murder. She is unwilling to be puppet again and will put herself on the line to find the killer before they strike again. Harlow teams up with the mysterious Officer Lam who is facing demons of his own. Harlow was not my favorite character from the Gemini Series but I really enjoyed what Hailey Edwards has done with this story. Hailey has some of the coolest characters and I love how she develops them within their story lines. But I digress, let's talk Harlow & Carter! SPOILER ALERT from here on out!!!!It was interesting to get a glimpse inside the mind of Harlow after her takeover from Charybdis and to hang with her on her self-discovery path. I say self-discovery rather than re-discovery since the whole reason she is on land instead of the water was because she is trying to find her place in the world. Being a magically augmented mermaid makes her even more of an outsider amongst her kind.Hello again, 'Officer' Carter Lam! I did not forget you from 'Head Above Water'. You have a pretty cool and scary abilities! Maybe a bit stalker-ish with Harlow but it all worked out in the end ;) . I found his character's transformation interesting. Going from an Officer persona with a cocky attitude to subdued and honest in his feelings and story with Harlow. After what she went through and what she needed in the moment-he fit the bill. I am glad Harlow found it in her to no longer be scared and saved his and Bianca's lives from the onryo. I really loved this line from Chapter 10:\"There was no such thing as recovery without struggle, healing without pain, redemption without surviving a crucible.\"I am a little confused about Harlow's references to the institution being a prison and her involuntary commitment being incarceration as it doesn't seem she wants to leave either. I can understand how she is struggling with the guilt of what she was forced to do under Charybdis' control and how that relates to those terms. I can also understand how she came to the conclusion that she 'deserves' to be there for her part in all of it but I am not sure that those terms tied well into the story as I thought they would.Also, I was surprised we never ran into Mai Hayashi since she and Carter have a previous connection. He also doesn't talk about his brother that was referenced in the second book of the Gemini Series.I love the author's writing style. Not a lot of beating around the bush and she starts all of her books off with a great scene that makes you want to keep reading. I finished this novella in less then 12 hours because I got 'hooked' and couldn't put it down-granted novellas are supposed to be shorter in length than the other books.I loved this story despite the two areas identified earlier. I would highly recommend it to a fellow paranormal fantasy reader. But this is not a stand alone Novella in my opinion. You really should read the 3 previous Gemini Series books and the Black Dog Series before that to understand all the dynamics in play. Thank you Hailey Edwards for creating this world. I have been addicted to your books since Thierry.Meg"}, {"userName": "Brandi Aga", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31214363-brandi-aga", "userReview": "First of all let's talk about that amazing cover! I'll admit I haven't had the pleasure of reading any of Hailey's books until this one because that cover just pulled me in. After reading this one I added all of her others to my list! Fish Out of Water is a short, intriguing, captivating story! I tend to shy away from novellas because I really love character development and just longer stories in general but I'm SO glad I went on with this one anyway. It may be short but it packs a punch! It's a little out of my element being fantasy. I found myself highlighting words and using my kindle dictionary to look up all the different mythical creatures. SO interesting... Opened up a whole new can of worms for me in the fantasy world. The setting of this book puts off an eerie.. creepy.. vibe that I just ATE UP. A mental hospital. Add a killer on the loose on top of that?! *SQUEEEEEEE* Harlow aka Pinks has the hots for a guard working her wing but he only seems to be there when no one else is around. Harlow has her doubts about him... Can she trust him? What does he want with her?! He has a few secrets up his sleeve.
