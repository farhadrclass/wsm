Vanek has already written it and gotten fifty signatures, but Stanek is too frightened to sign himself. I liked these. On Tyranny, the book we Messy Housekeepers read before this one, recommended Vaclav Havel, so we read these. Well, everyone else did, except we met last Sunday and today is Thursday. We absolutely should do a reading of \u201cAudience\u201d at the brewery in the next town over. I read a pdf of these plays on my phone. I\u2019ve never done that before."}, {"userName": "Harald", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48645206-harald", "userReview": "Three short, but subtle plays that indict the oppressive character of the communist regime in power in Czechoslovakia from 1968 to 1989. The Van\u00115k character does not confront his oppressors directly, but rather the hangers-on who have made comfortable adjustments to the regime.
