On behalf of them, I\u2019m here to PICK a bloody BATTLE with you Mr. Chetan Bhagat.Lets\u2019 start by discussing you obsession with degrading the community. I can understand the concept of laughing at one self, however I do not believe that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to do though.In all of your stories, a Punjabi mom can be just a HOUSEWIFE and a DUMB bimbo. What\u2019s up with that man? According to you, the Punjabi ladies or moms in specific, are the most shallow people on the face of the planet, right? Bothered only by SELLING their sons and bringing down their daughters. Or is it that you only reflect the kind of household you were brought up in, is that it? I think so.No\u2026I won\u2019t bother writing good things about them. I do believe it\u2019s your own personal life experiences that bleed through into your books.Let\u2019s talk about how you sound like a cheap script-writer. Why is that?Do you only write so that your books could be made into cheesy Bollywood Movies? If that is so, then why do you bother calling yourself an AUTHOR, why not a SCRIPTWRITER? I mean your books are filled with instances that are so CLICHED. You just have to have a wedding going on and then you just have to go ahead and ruin it. I say this as a reader who has read all of your books, all bad with the exception of Revolution 2020, which was marginally OK. You had this same setting going on in the book 2 States as well.Let\u2019s talk about your obsession with FEMINISM.Do you really believe in the concept of FEMINISM, or do you just like to think so? There is another term I\u2019d like to introduce you to, it\u2019s called \nPSEUDO-FEMINISM\n. That\u2019s what your book reeks of. If you don\u2019t know what it means then try googling it. If you believe, that girls should have equal rights for all things, then why put men down on the same thing. If according to you, it\u2019s ok for a girl to choose to be Career-Oriented, then why can\u2019t a man CHOOSE that he wants a home-maker, or vice versa? Most of the people don\u2019t understand what feminism is really about. It\u2019s about empowering Women, by giving them the FREEDOM of CHOICE. Not reservations and certainly not by putting MEN DOWN. Your book sounded a lot like Deepika Padukone\u2019s advertisement called \u201cMy Choice.\u201d Was that a little too much for you to comprehend? I\u2019m sorry, at times I get carried away.Let\u2019s talk about your writing and book. Shall we?Well what\u2019s the point of discussing a BAD AUTHOR? You know why I call you a bad author?Allow me to explain in just one sentence. \n\nYOU UNDERESTIMATE YOUR READERS. \n\nYou think Indians are dumb and can\u2019t read well written books and so you try to dumb it down. You\u2019re not helping, believe me. I don\u2019t know when you left India and what kind of image you carry around in your head but let me tell you that people here, me included, read top most authors they can get their hands on. They love good story telling with a smooth writing style and an enticing vocabulary, even if it means picking up a dictionary. You think your readers dumb and quite frankly insult their intellect by using phrases like \n \u201cLittle bit also you don\u2019t understand\u201d & \u201cKeep Control\u201d. \n I do believe, again, that this is a reflection of your own self. You may have been an Indian but don\u2019t let that fool you into the belief that you have an understanding of your Country. YOU DON\u2019T.BTW, This is me being an optimist, who believes that you dumb down your books on purpose. Hate to think that an IIT & IIM guy such as yourself, who actually worked at GOLDMAN SACHS, is NOT CAPABLE of writing anything better than THIS..!!I\u2019d like to add just one thing before I sign off.I think you are a worldly gentleman. You have spanned many nations and might know about many cultures across the globe. I hope you know that every single one of them too have their own issues.Saying things like  \u201cConsidering INDIA is a country where in-laws burn their brides, I guess they were nice people\u201d  about your own nation just for a cheap laugh is not very becoming. You have a knack for highlighting the issues with the Indian society through your books in a very negative manner. It portrays India as a country of savages. I\u2019d like to suggest 2 things:1.\tEven though you might not consider yourself an Indian anymore, it would be great if you could highlight such issue is a manner where it doesn\u2019t DEGRADE and DEMEAN your nation and its people.2.\tIf you truly think that you know the problems with our nation, if you think you can offer a better path and guide this country out of such horrible practices, why don\u2019t you trying becoming a part of the system and then work on it. It\u2019d be better than you commenting on such issues in an insensitive way.Ohh the Book writing part. Right. Yeah, you can't do that. Nope. You're not up to the challenge.I'll say, the amateur guy Sandip Khade is better than you since he isn't as well read as you and still he had an imaginative plot even if he couldn't do justice to it. I dare say, given an opportunity, many guys and gals in India could actually teach YOU how to write.Yeah, like I said, You ain't no Author man..!!CHEERS"}, {"userName": "Anuradha", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48159983-anuradha", "userReview": "No judgments, please! Those of you that know me, know that I sometimes read the really bad books to trash them. What better book is there than Chetan Bhagat's take on feminism? I'm not going to bother with the spoilers here, because I don't actually expect people to read this other than to trash it. If you are reading it because you think \"it's good Indian literature\", I would request you to kindly fuck off from this review, because you will not like what I have to say. Meet Radhika Mehta, smart, beautiful, rich, and a general Mary Sue. She's an Indian girl who is opinionated, has slept around, and makes a ton of money, so on cue, you're supposed to hate her, or so she says in the very first few lines of the book. Of course, because she's this quintessential overachiever, she never really believes that she is beautiful, no matter who tells her, and how many ever times they tell her. What did I say? She reeks of Mary Sue-ness. She's getting married to Brijesh; it's an arranged marriage. But because she is so rich, of course, she's paying for the wedding herself. All one crore rupees of it. Or, you know, 150,000 dollars of it. Of course, like any CB novel, the protagonist here looks at arranged marriages with much disdain. Now, I'm not one for arranged marriages myself, which is why I wouldn't agree to one and leave my husband-to-be at the altar. I wouldn't spend half the book bitching about it either. I have one question to ask Mr. Bhagat, though. Pray, tell me sir, what did your mother do to you? Why must you paint Punjabi mothers in such a regressive, conservative manner? What kind of a mother says, \"hey, kid, I'm not proud of your achievements because you earn a ton of money and now no man will marry you?\" No mother that I know of for sure. Every Punjabi mother that CB depicts is such a stereotype, it hurts my brain to read it. Chetan Bhagat does not know the meaning of \"likable protagonists\". Here's what he does: he makes his characters smart and \"unattractive\" and opinionated. These opinions are supposed to make the other characters hate or dislike or be in awe of the protagonist, and make the \"educated Indian youth\" find them appealing and endearing. The fact of the matter is that it does not work at all. I hated Radhika Mehta with such burning passion, were I to meet her in real life, I would slap her. More importantly, however, especially with respect to this book, I would like to talk about feminism. Feminism isn't a switch one can turn on and off, you know, Mr. Bhagat? So imagine my surprise when our feminist female protagonist decides not once, but twice, to quit her job because the douchebag that she fell in love with turned out to be a...douchebag. Do not write about issues that you cannot comprehend, Mr. Bhagat. Do not write about women when you don't know the first thing about them. Actually, you don't know the first thing about humans, so there. And I repeat, as a feminist myself, feminism isn't about trashing men, it's about empowering women, so don't you dare give us feminists a bad name! And seriously, if I have to read about the girl's side adjusting one more time, so help me god! Why? Why, in a book that you claim to have feminist undertones would you repeatedly put that? And I repeat again, leaving your groom at the altar, on the threshold of marriage, after you agreed to marry him does not a feminist make. Before you write your next feminist novel, Mr. Bhagat, I would recommend that you actually read up on it beforehand, rather than conjuring up your own convoluted views on it. Tell me, was this to make up for the immortal words of your previous book? You know, the whole \n\"deti hai toh de, nahi toh kat le\"\n (which roughly translates to \"give me your virginity or fuck off\") drama? You get a LOL for effort, Mr. Bhagat. Let's talk a little bit about the plot, or lack of it, rather, shall we? So Radhika dated this Debu for two years before he dumped her because his fragile male ego couldn't handle her being more successful than him. I mean, she came to his apartment to propose to him and tell him she was quitting her job, and he had his dick in another woman. Are you telling me he suddenly realised that hey, he loves her after all and flew halfway across the world to woo her on her wedding day? There is more drama in this sentence than there has been in the last three books I've read, and would you believe, it gets worse. So she moved to Hong Kong after her stint in New York, and fell in love with a married man with whom she \"made love, crazy, crazy love\" to for almost a year. And then he dumped her because he wanted her on the side and not as a wife, because she wasn't \"wife material\". Guess what? He also flies all the way to Goa to woo her back. What bullshit! It gets worse because she considers leaving her groom to be for these two dick for brains, ya know, for old times' sake. Well, she does leave her groom, but to find herself or some baloney. Much like Radhika says in the prologue, \nhere I am in a situation where I don\u2019t know what the fuck is going on\n. The situation here being this steaming pile of shit book. And Radhika, like you say so yourself, I did not like you. However, that was not because of your money, or your active sex life, or your opinions. How shallow must you think we are to not like you for such superficial reasons? No, Radhika, see, most Indian women of your freedom, education, and social standing are as rich, as sexually active, and as opinionated as you are. That their opinions make more sense is of course why we like them. I did not like you because you were a shit person with shittier opinions. Opinions that you only spouted when they suited you. You believed in feminism when it suited you. Where was this feminism when you wrecked another woman's marriage? Don't blame it on the man, you were equally responsible for it, you horrible, horrible woman. I'm not even going to venture into talking about the writing in this, because that would lead to intense and very expensive therapy for me. I will, however, leave you with some gems; make of that what you will. \nShe was the girl boys had crushes on. I was the girl who started to wear spectacles in class six.\n\nThen I joined Shri Ram College of Commerce, or SRCC. People say it is one of the best colleges for nerds.\n\nAnd what sort of a name is Brijesh? Can it be more unfashionable?\n\nI will think about marriage later, mom. I am still new at my job.\n\n\u2018You okay with the order, baby? Wanted anything else?\u2019 Debu said to me.\nAnd it goes on...Bad grammar, limited vocabulary, the usual with a side of fries. I can't even muster up enough rage to trash this book well enough. All I can say is that the Indian crowd has grown up, Mr. Bhagat, and so should you. You should read Manveer's review of this. It's hilarious.\nINITIAL REVIEW:\nI, Anuradha Herur, of fairly sane mind and definitely not enough time on my hands am going to read this book, because, really, can you imagine how much fun I'll have trashing it?

I picked up this book just to rant about it.\u201cSome people are good at taking decisions. I am not one of them.\u201dMe too, Mr. Bhagat, me too. Picking up your book was one such decision.So, Chetan Bhagat has outdone himself. Really. Some of his past works have actually been readable but not this. Even cringeworthy would be too good a word.So, yes. I ended up wasting a few hours on this book. Actually, I fucking wasted my Friday evening of this book. Oh wait, I fucking put Wheel of Time (at one of the peak points in the series) aside to pick this up. What the fuck was I thinking? THE SACRIFICES WE MAKE!Was the writing annoying? Yes. Was it cliched? Yes. Was it repetitive? Yes. Was it bad? Yes. Definitely yes.From reading all the words I went to tap tap tap on my Kindle in like less than half an hour. Also, I was groaning on like almost every page. It only gets worse when you go along. I would quote but I won\u2019t grace this book by going over it again just to find those cringeworthy lines. I mean, some of the dialogue delivery was.. bc na ho payega mujhse.The characters were just pathetic. Not losers, but ugh. The difference was all the more prominent because I had just been reading Wheel of Time. Seriously, Radhika makes Elayne and Nynaeve look like goddesses. Definitely needs some Mazrim Taim treatment. It was like jumping into a Vortex in terms of quality. Well, on the bright side, this will make that gem of a series look even better when I return to it.

I LOVE MY COUNTRY BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WON'T CRITICISE WHENEVER SOMETHING IS WRONG. I HAVE CRITICISED MANY BOOKS FROM DIFFERENT NATIONS AND YOU CAN STALK ALL MY REVIEWS TO SEE THAT. IT'LL NEVER BE FAIR FROM MY PART TO JUDGE OTHER AUTHORS HARSHLY AND BE BIASED. SO IF YOU'RE OFFENDED, DON'T READ THIS REVIEW. AND IF YOU COMMENT SOMETHING THAT WILL LEAD TO A FIGHT, I'M NOT GOING TO RESPOND YOU.This was one heck of an annoying and frustrating book. At first, I was surprised how the characters seemed extremely orthodox. So I checked the time when the book was published. I was dumbfounded that it was published recently and yet the thoughts about the people seemed from the period of 1990s. I knew Chetan Bhagat\u2019s writing was horrible and honestly, now I feel he just writes for money, not passion. Even my eighteen years old brain can understand that the story was filled clinches, stereotypes and impossible circumstances. I want the author to be more observant in his surroundings, analyse people and how they react to different situations, how problems arises in one's life and what do they do to solve it instead of being in a cloud of dream and writing irrational stuff. It had all the negative aspects like slut- shaming, body- shaming, sexism, etc.So the story begins with Radhika, an independent working girl, and her arranged marriage to Brijesh, about whom she knows nothing. The book jumps in past describing her previous love affairs and in present describing various ceremonies that are held before the marriage. You can see the stereotypical aunties who force girls to marriage or gossip something irrelevant, sister who cares more of her attire and hence she's considered selfish, mother who argues a lot, father in background doing nothing, etc. This is where I started getting angry. Open your eyes, buddy. There are many supportive and understanding Indian families out there. Radhika was a pathetic character. She was whiny, fickle, shallow, gullible and spineless. I really couldn't connect her behaviour to her success because one thing I know about the ambitious girls is that they aren't easily manipulated. The way she compares each and every thing is downright tormenting. After everything she has to face due to her ex- boyfriends, she's like \u201cOh, people do mistakes all the time, right? So maybe he might be sorry after all\u201d and considers to leave her fiance who is nothing but good to her. And comparing her fiance and ex- boyfriend\u2019s name was extremely immature. Honestly girl, you're getting married to an unknown person and you're worried about how your name is going to sound after marriage instead of getting to know about your fianc\u00e9? And how can she call herself a feminist when she doesn't give any respect to other female characters in the entire book? I know you want to show their nastiness but couldn't you attempt at least once in your life time to be matured and kind to them? Maybe then they could change their attitude towards you. No, you can't even consider that. And to describe in short about Debashish and Neel, well, they were (pardon my language) a##h#les in their own ways. They were selfish, manipulative and cunning. I was seriously going crazy with all these characters. And don't talk about the ending, it made me crazy as hell. And honestly Mr. Bhagat, couldn't you be creative instead of bringing DDLJ (an Indian movie) in a twisted, messed up way in the story? Can you really mention different cultures of India properly instead of letting it be one dimensional? I don't think I can call you an author because the book is more like a movie script. Leave the part to make your books engaging because first you need grammar lessons. I know I'm not perfect in grammar but I'm not an author. I don't think I'll buy any of his books again. And honestly, the book doesn't suit the title. Mr. Bhagat, an Indian girl is not female version of yourself. So take some trouble to get acquainted to the REAL INDIAN GIRLS, NOT THE ONES MADE UP IN YOUR MIND and ask her about her life, her ambition, her dream and her thoughts about society.

One Indian Girl is so much like a Bollywood movie that it has one complete 7-page chapter dedicated to women dancing to hit Bollywood songs. I am not kidding. Chapter 38. You can check.I will tell you something about Feminism, as best as I can in my capacity as a non-intellectual Indian who thank-god isn't a Punjabi. Cuz, Punjabis suck. Ask Chetan Bhagat. He has the dirt on them. So anyway, Feminism is a radical movement that believes that every person deserves to be treated equally - socially, economically, legally and culturally - irrespective of their gender. I could be wrong because I am not smart like Chetan Bhagat.Now I will tell you who can or cannot be called a feminist: A guide by Chetan Bhagat.1. If you are a Punjabi Aunty, you can't be a feminist. Nope. Sorry Aunty. Namaste ji.2. If you are a pretty girl who has every guy's attention in a room, you can't be a feminist you whore. 3. If you don't get good marks in your 12th Boards, you can't be a feminist. Drop le tu kamini. 4. You can't be a feminist unless you pay for your own marriage, all 1 Crore INR or 150,000 USD of it yourself. 5. But if you are a nerd and you hate girls who don't study and are really pretty because they spend so much time on make-up and grooming, then my friend, you could be a feminist.6. If you believe that the very word \"feminism\" is unnecessary and all of us should be just \"humanists\", again you will make a pretty decent feminist. I am NOT trying to be ironic. Mummy promise.7. If you think that people will not like you because you are a woman who earns more than most men and have dated *gasp* two guys, then that too will make you a pretty judgmental fucker. I mean, Feminist. That will make you a feminist.8. If you are Chetan Bhagat, you are a feminist. Humanist. I will tell you something about Radhika. She is the heroine of a very feminist friendly novel. Written by a person who understands Feminism very well. Who earns half a million dollars as an investment banker per year. Now this woman, could be doing charity. This woman could be befriending other women and having the time of her life. But what this woman does is get dumped by a total loser (which is FIIINE, could happen to anyone but 4 years later she is having second thoughts on her marriage to a PERFECTLY DECENT GUY because of the same loser), has an affair with a married man and father (again FIIIIINE, could happen to anyone but 1 year later she is enjoying Radhika ka Swayamwar right before her actual marriage) and finally dumps everyone and goes on a world tour. Isn't it ironic, that this super-feminist novel reduced its super-feminist heroine (a successful, capable, independent and BRILLIANT heroine) to nothing more than someone who despite all she has achieved couldn't find happiness until she found the right man. The right man, by the way, is the guy she dumped on her wedding day. Stop writing Chetan. Just stop.================Edit: Okay yesterday I was kinda pissed hence the ranting review. Today I can look at it a little more objectively so I though I should point out the one, only ONE good thing about this novel.The day Radhika has sex for the first time, she asked her partner to help her get off. It was a genuinely positive message about women owning their sexuality and it was very well portrayed."}, {"userName": "Anagha", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44427157-anagha", "userReview": "I was kind of interested to read this one since the tag 'feminism' was attached to it. But it didn't meet my expectations. The writing wasn't good. The story was okay. The characters weren't likeable except Brijesh(too good to be true in fact) maybe. Radhika, the biggest hypocrite in the book irritated me throughout. For example , complains all along on how people never considered her pretty and how her prettier sister was preferred by the guys. But at the same time also rejects prospective grooms just because they are 'ugly' saying things like 'I can't wake up next to a man like that'. And then rejects few more for the same reason - looks. Just for the heck of it. To 'get back' at her mother. The biggest LOLworthy moment came when she rejected a guy because he earned lesser than her. Tsk tsk. So much for feminism.If what Radhika believes is feminism, I am glad I ain't a feminist in spite of being a woman.

I started reading novels after knowing about the humorous contents his books has. And after that I make sure that I read his books the first day after its release before someone else starts giving the review. Generally people believe in giving negative reviews to his book to prove themselves intellectual, literati or whatever! The last book that made me feel that it's the Chetan Bhagat I know was 2 States. Revolution 20-20 and Half Girlfriend couldn't impress me because I felt that I was reading a movie script than a fiction novel. This time he has come up with a book in female voice named \"One Indian Girl\". I was doubtful about this one too as I believed that it would be too feminist to digest. But fortunately, I am enough impressed with the story and felt that I read a book written by one of my favorite authors.The story is about a girl who is quite feminist and does not believe in getting pulled down by her parents or anyone just because she is a girl. She makes it sure that she does things which she feels is right without worrying about anyone else. She also have to hear about how she is doing things which are okay with boys but she shouldn't do it being a girl. But she is what not many girls in India are. She has a great job out of India. She earns what 10 average men cannot earn collectively in India. She has more than one relationship which is not digestible in Indian culture. And story of such courageous and successful Indian girl makes this book a phenomenal read. Chetan Bhagat have not tried to preach much feminism which is the plus point of the book. The story is very well handled right from the prologue. As is the case with many stories, even this one gets better when the story goes back in flashback. The characterization by CB is spot-on once again. The character of Radhika is very well crafted and the writing style of CB does not allow you to think that its not been written by a girl. Yes, I agree that few sentences are provocative as they are kind of general statements which not many girls would think while being intimate with someone or dressing themselves for a party. And I am pretty sure that CB-haters are going to pick up these sentences against him to pull this book down which has already broken Pre-ordering record on Amazon.The book has not been stretched anywhere. The second flashback is not as good as the first one and it has a reason because the affair is with a person of another class itself. The climax is little filmy but has an appropriate ending. I was little unsure about what decision will the girl take in the end but the feminist point is well handled in the end and the final decision of the girl only makes you smile in the end of the book. Talking about the drawbacks I would say that too much insight of the protagonist's job has been discussed which becomes irritating after a point of time. As I said above, at few places, CB has not justified a girl's point of view correctly which looks quite fake and attention-seeking. Also, the humour is again missing just like the last two books for which CB has become popular. Overall, I give this book 3.75* out of 5. It can surely be read once.

By then I'd grown as a reader and couldn't handle the trash Bhagat dished out in the name of \"youthful-hinglish novels\"I was one of the first people to scoff and troll the author when his twitter feed announced his next *cringe* book. Definitely wasn't going to waste time, money, and effort on this book. And then I read an amazingly vitriolic review of the book by a hilarious Abhishek Sikhwal on the Daily O (you can read it here - http://www.dailyo.in/humour/chetan-bh...) I knew the book would be bad. But how bad could it be really? I already know Chetan Bhagat's prose resembles the \"cow essay\" format. He writes only about idiot people living in a make-believe world hoping his books will be made into dumb movies (and they have) So, really, what angered Sikhwal to this extent? Apparently quite a lot. Let's start with Radhika Mehta, the protagonist, a high-flying VP at Goldman-Sachs. Ms.Mehta is a self-entitled, self-pitying, snobbish brat who's always hankering for attention. In a nutshell, she's the female version of Chetan Bhagat. We never get a sense of her being independent - no matter what she does, she wants \"love\". Its not enough that she has Parents and friends (mostly non-existent) who love her. No, she needs a man to \"complete\" her. I am not saying that successful women do not need love or men, its just they don't need those things validate their existence.Bhagat in trying to give us a \u201cmodern\u201d, \u201ccareer-oriented\u201d, and \u201csuccessful\u201d Indian woman, ends up giving us a Bollywood clich\u00e9. Therefore, she \u201cwaxes\u201d, and starts wearing western outfits. Hmm, don\u2019t think Bhagat has heard or seen the likes of Chanda Kochhar.Ms. Mehta, according to the men around her, is \"smart\", \"funny\", and \"attractive\". We see no evidence of this. She's whiny, demanding attention and when she's not doing that she's giving dumbfuck solutions to dumbfuck problems at Goldman Sachs. Way to use your experience in the book Bhagat. Now, this, this is the same woman who turns into a blubbering mess when her first BF dumps her. So much so, at one point she's stalking him desperately! He broke up with you over a text message woman!! Have some self-respect! Grow a spine!The book goes steadily downhill from here. Because Ms.Mehta is a \"valuable asset\" (whatever) to the company, they transfer her everytime she threatens to resign (because she messed up on the relationship front. Boo-hoo) Let me once again remind you. She works for Goldman-frigging-Sachs. And then it drags on to end in a shaadi-waala bollywood types shenanigans which ends oh so predictably.I don\u2019t even want to talk about the men in the book. They\u2019re such caricatures that to call them a stereotype would be an understatement to stereotype. Everyone's been asking me why I read the book if I hated the author so much. Here's the thing. I don't care that the book is ridiculously dumb with prose that can be edited by a 6th grader. What bothered and scared me is the stance the book and its author have claimed to take. Its supposed to be about \"feminism\". At one point, Brijesh Gulati, Ms. Mehta's fiance tells her that there is no such thing as \"feminist\" and we all should be \"humanists\". What the hell? In the same chapter, he tells her to not use \"hi-fi words like feminism\". Asshole. I wonder if Bhagat knows about the recent movement in Saudi where women are fighting to stop being treated as men's possessions. Or real issues working women face such as unequal pay, sexism, harassment, and eve-teasing at workplace? Ms. Mehta has no such issues. She's transferred to fancy offices at her whim and given jaw-dropping bonuses. I also wonder who these vapid creatures are that he spoke to when \"researching\" for this dimwit excuse of a book. As a woman and a feminist, this book greatly disturbed me. Does Bhagat realise that he actually influences an entire generation of young (and stupid) people? That as an author who made Indian writing appealing to a large mass, he now has to be socially responsible? I wouldn't have had an issue with this book had it not boasted a feminist protagonist. Imagine a 16-yr old boy/girl reading this book and learning that feminism is a \"hi-fi\" word.  Dear Mr. Bhagat, if you are reading this, please note, be careful what you dish out. These are hard times. We already have movies glorifying stalking, eve-teasing, and objectifying women. We do not need an author to mercilessly kill feminism all because of his warped understanding of the concept. Bring back that Bhagat who so skillfully inter-weaved some very serious social messages in Five-Point Someone or Three Mistakes of My Life with simple prose. Everyone who is reading this, please read the book. Read the book and let the world know how wrong Bhagat is. Heck, let him know he shouldn't get away with writing rubbish.I don't know what young India needs. But I know it definitely doesn't need a self-important Chetan Bhagat talking about a concept he barely understands.This is one (angry) Indian girl, signing off.PS: If you want to read this book, please get in touch with me.
