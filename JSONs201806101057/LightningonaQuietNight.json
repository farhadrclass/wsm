That which is unexpected and unprecedented often carries the most chilling powerful punch. The initial action/suspense builds slowly \u2013 there are quite a few characters and more than one story thread to keep up with \u2013 but OH MY, about one-third in, it begins picking up speed with a lightening-sharp edge, and by story\u2019s end, HOLY MOLY what a wallop. From the ultra-realistic characters to the post WWII Mississippi setting to descriptive details and nuances, I was impressed with this gripping, astute novel; surprisingly, blown-away. The self-righteous, pew-sitting-do-gooders of post war Beneficent, Mississippi think that evil can\u2019t possibly touch their quaint little town. After all, their town motto says it all: \u201cA Town as Good as Its Name.\u201d So when a member of their community is found murdered within town borders (the only murder ever to have occurred in Beneficent) the only logical explanation is that an \u201coutsider\u201d is to blame. Smug and complacent in that belief, shock is short-lived and life goes on as usual. But not for long . . . \u201cWhen Pride goes in one door, virtue goes out another.\u201d As the \u2018do-good\u2019 facade starts to crumble and shocking truths begin to surface, mayhem takes pride to the edge of no-return. There are none righteous \u2013 no, not one. \u201cLightning on a Quiet Night\u201d illuminates this truth both beautifully and hauntingly. Not everyone is as virtuous as they project. Not all are as soiled as gossips declare. And not everyone in Beneficent comes out unscathed. But all are given a chance at redemption. Taylor\u2019s writing is intelligent and believable, bringing an atmospheric, realistic, literary quality and depth to Christian Fiction \u2013 a genre that\u2019s often saturated with sappy, cheesy, preachy, and unrealistic sugar-coated every-thing-works-out-perfectly novels. Yes, life can be a beautiful journey. However, it can also be messy, unlovely, painful, daunting, confusing, violent and terrifying . . . and Donn Taylor balances the good and the bad, the lovely and ugly, with inspirational grit and grace.Five, faith-based top-pick stars. Full disclosure: I received this novel through Goodreads giveaways. Thank you Donn Taylor and Lighthouse Publishing of the Carolinas."}, {"userName": "Lisa Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7092311-lisa-johnson", "userReview": "Title: Lightning on a Quiet NightAuthor: Donn TaylorWebsite: http://www.donntaylor.com/Pages: 330Year: 2014Publisher: Lighthouse Publishing of the CarolinasDonn Taylor brings to his audience a captivating mystery set in a small town named Beneficent in the mid-1940s and early 50s. A widower working for a chemical company moves into town with his grown daughter to oversee the building of plant. Stephen and Lisa Kemper feel like outsiders who work hard to be accepted by the small town. Lisa is still considering what she will choose for her graduate degree while living with her father as he adjusts to a different normal.Lisa meets Jack who is a farmer and a former serviceman, but instantly forms a dislike for him due to his utopia view of the town. Many other characters living in the town aren\u2019t just unique; they have secrets. While most in the town attend the local church, Lisa senses they aren\u2019t really paying attention to the sermons. The whole town tends is self-sufficient and above others until an unknown receipt is discovered that climactically brings clear and present danger to Jack, Lisa and the small town.This is a small town whose main challenge is speeding and boot-legging. Now, there is a murder, which everyone believes it is the work of an outsider. Wait until you unearth the reason for such a deep rooted belief by the townspeople. No matter which of the characters sticks out to you, the message for everyone becomes obvious along with the challenge to be authentic. I also came away from Donn\u2019s work of fiction seeing that no one is immune from pain and all have the capability to make choices. The choice I saw was how people could live life on past accomplishments, heartaches and/or failure or they could look up to God who knows them best. So, in a way, the fictional world in the book reaches the real world by reminding us that God loves, knows, forgives and restores anyone willing to draw near to Him. Lightening on a Quiet Night is the second novel of Donn\u2019s that I have read, and if you have not had the pleasure of perusing his work, may I suggest strongly you do! You won\u2019t regret the choice!My rating is 5+ stars.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

And also how you live out your faith and your attitude to others.The novel is set in the town of Beneficent in the post World War II years. All the inhabitants are good people, believing that nothing bad has ever, nor will ever happen in their town. The sign on entering the town, even boasts that it is 'as good as it's name'. Newcomer Lisa Kempar arrives with her father Stephen, and finds it hard to believe.Beneficent is shaken to its core, when the body of one of its own, is discovered. Everyone looks at everyone else, but they all look so 'good', that the people believe that the murderer must be an outsider.Lightning On A Quiet Night is a wonderful study in what can happen when people take their eyes off God, and focus on good works and being 'good'. Pride can bring about the downfall of an individual or a community. When one is more concerned with looking good, that looking to the One who is good, then sooner or later trouble will come.The novel emphasises the power of prayer, both in desperate situations and in repentance. God longs to bend His ear, and hear the sincere prayers of an individual. It is then, that He can bring peace and calm to the most horrendous situations.Another theme that emerges is that of forgiveness. Characters show that it is often hard to dispense forgiveness, but when they do, they feel freer and much better.Running alongside the crime, is also a developing romance. The reader enjoys journeying with the individuals concerned, and wondering if this will lead anywhere or not.I found Lightning On A Quiet Night to be a really gripping read. The action went from exciting to positively nail biting and heart racing! If you like a crime novel that keeps you guessing, and a smattering of romance, combined with the study of a small American town, then this is the novel for you.

There were no grammar/typo errors, nor any repetitive or out of line sequence sentences. Lots of exciting scenarios, with several twists/turns & a huge set of unique characters to keep track of.

The storyline seemed to \u201cjump\u201d around from one character to the other. I continued to read and began to understand that the background on several characters was presented during these first chapters to help the reader understand them in the midst of the plot. I am so glad that I hung in and continued to read the book. The storyline kept me interested and surprised at some of the twists and turns until the conclusion.\tBeneficient, Mississippi is a small southern town. The setting is in 1948 after World War II. The citizens are extremely proud of their town and its reputation of Christian community closeness free from crime. Lisa Kemper and her father are Northerners who have recently moved into the community. Mr. Kemper is to manage the chemical plant his company is building in Beneficient. Dissatisfied with small town southern living, Lisa is hanging in with her father until she begins graduate school the following year. Jack, a war veteran and hometown boy who was a member of the 1942 championship basketball team, owns a growing farm inherited from his parents when both were killed in a car accident while he was in the war. He is very proud of his town and grateful to the community for its help while he was deployed.The peaceful town\u2019s atmosphere is disrupted with the murder of a teenage girl. Who could do such a thing? \u201cNo one from their town; must be an outsider,\u201d is the mindset of all the locals. The death begins the intertwining of Jack and Lisa\u2019s lives. As the couple begins to become acquainted, the town\u2019s reputation faces other tribulations besides pride \u2013 greed, lust, theft, murder. What will happen to the citizens of Beneficient and their town? This book is well worth the time to read and find out.

I found their self-righteous beliefs representative of the community where I grew up, and was able to relate to the mentality that bad things just don't happen in Beneficent. Townspeople are shaken by the murder of a popular teenage girl. Who in their community could possibly commit such a heinous crime, certainly not one of their own? It has to be an outsider!Lisa Kemper is appalled at the ridiculous mindset in the community. Her association with war hero, Jack Davis is based on suspicion, with an attraction she can't quite comprehend. Characters throughout this well written small-town mystery are believable and representative of small-town America. They are as varied as members of any community. Personalities are creative and well depicted, a gossipy woman who can't control her nosiness, a sheriff so laid back one wonders if he knows his business, as well as a wealthy banker and his family, people who are well respected.This is a great story of \"people\" and the perceptions they hold, as well as an unpredictable mystery that captured my attention throughout. I found it difficult to put this book down, wanting to discover what would be revealed in the next chapters. I highly recommend this book for the action and discoveries that the author creates. The underlying themes of faith and redemption are commendable.

Jack begins as an enigma, a mystery that takes time to discover as each chapter peels back another layer to his character: his history, his military life, and his determination, but above all his love for the town and its people. As for the secondary characters, each promises and delivers a well rounded tale and adds the dimension needed to the story, from the red herring to the wolf in sheep's clothing.With each steady pace of the plot the reader is shown every facet of the town which prided itself as the jewel of charity and doing good. But as the Scripture says: Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.But instead of completely falling, the town and its people learn a valuable lesson in love, forgiveness, and humility. In my opinion this book is a great piece of literary prose. Multiple layers of symbolism, well developed characters, deep themes, and a range of tones and moods keep this book interesting and engaging.It quickly became one of my favorites and one that I would recommended time and time again.

Garey Review***** 5 StarsMy husband and I read this book aloud and truly enjoyed the setting, character development, mystery progression and resolution, and the humor. As the reader dips into the quiet setting where everything is suppose to be a cut above other places because it keeps up the facade that nothing bad ever happens in the blessed town, a murder of a cheerleader shocks the town into knowing that crime can occur there as in any other place. No place on earth is above sin despite the people's best wishes.Not wishing to give any spoilers in my review, I will just say that the unexpected is found on the next page or in the next chapter and you will be busy turning the pages and kept wondering, \"What next?\" The character development was perfect and thick with love interest that misinterprets the thoughts and actions leading to acceptance. The author has a good handle on the motives and expressions of his characters so they are at all points believable. We enjoyed the spiritual aspect of the book which was not overdone, but handled in a way that shows grace and mercy worked out in a church setting as one would always hope to see. Forgiveness is an issue that must be worked through, and the solutions that relate to that might be helpful to a reader going through similar issues. The author left no strings hanging at the end. His storyline was flawless.Thanks to the author, publisher, and bookfun.org for allowing me the pleasure of reviewing this book.

The author writes about a small town much like that of Mayberry from the fifties. It's a quiet friendly town, where everyone knows each other. They are neighborly and watch out for each other. One of the main focus of the town is the sports team at the school. It seems like the whole town rallies around the promising team that almost makes it to the state tournament. One stormy night a tragedy occurs that rocks the small quiet town. Their secure little quaint town will be tested and no on seems immune from the backlash of this unforgettable act of violence. The author demonstrates his ability to write a fast pace book with many twists and turns. The town has been so rigid in their belief that nothing bad could ever happen in their town, that when the unthinkable happens, they all believe it was an act of violence from an outsider. How could they believe one of their own would harm another?The characters are well written with each one having to deal with their own acceptance of life in a small town , where violence steps in and takes their security away. I loved the history of an era almost forgotten and how the author writes with a flair of familiarity that gives readers a picture of that time period. The book has mystery, a little romance and people who you come to know by the words that gracefully glide across the pages. I could not put the book down and when I finished, I felt a sense of time traveling to an era that was an important part of history."}, {"userName": "Catherine Castle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20577984-catherine-castle", "userReview": "Rich in language and DescriptionIt took me three tries to get into this book, mostly because I was reading late at night and kept falling asleep, accidentally paging forward on my phone\u2019s Kindle app, and then wondering who the characters I kept encountering were (there are quite a few introduced in the beginning) and how they figured into the story. I\u2019m glad I persevered with this story. Once I started reading during the daylight hours (when I wasn\u2019t sleep deprived) I devoured this book in two days.Well-written and well-edited, the author, Donn Taylor, has created a multilayered mystery that is rich in language and unordinary words. The book\u2019s sometimes omniscient feeling POV, scene flashbacks into various characters\u2019 POVs, poetic language, and detailed description gives the book the feel of an older, literary style rather than that of a fast-paced modern story.  The author\u2019s use of fresh lines such as \u201cmore chance of getting hit with a streetcar in Venice\u201d caught me unexpectedly, and I found myself chuckling at his wit. There were places in the story that I considered head-hopping, which is one of my big pet peeves, but I forgave the author because of the richness of his language. He also threw enough red herrings into the mix that I wasn\u2019t certain about the killer\u2019s identity. Kudos for that, Donn!This is a book heavy with religious overtones, but I didn\u2019t feel like they were out of place in the story.

And then after a few chapters, it grabs you and doesn't let go until you reach the end!  The story takes place in 1948 in a small town in Mississippi. The people that live here feel that everything is good, that their town is the best thing around, and that nothing bad can ever happen. When a girl is murdered the townsfolk are astonished, and they are quite certain the murderer is from some place else. An awakening is about to happen here and the people will never be the same again! Donn Taylor has written a beautiful story filled with mystery, suspense and romance. But it is more than that, because sometimes we need to experience change. Sometimes we grow the most in life when we are hurting. That is also when we learn to lean on God and learn to forgive. And these people in Mississippi are going to need to do some changing and growing!  Taylor has created a story filled with emotions and old fashioned values, where neighbors know and look out for each other, and where pranks don't physically harm anyone. They love their town and take pride in it. But, pride can sometimes be a problem... This story is clean (there is an affair going on, but nothing graphic) and easy to follow.

I love a good mystery where the murder is not discovered until near the end and sub-crimes come to the surface. This had all those elements and more.

It is eventually discovered that the murderer is a well- known citizen of Beneficent, a man no one suspected. These tragedies brought the people of Beneficent together in a way they never before experienced. They learned to place their faith in the Lord and not in their own virtue as they had been doing for so many years.I enjoyed this book very much and recommend it all those who enjoy suspense, love and tragedy all rolled into one novel."}, {"userName": "Carol McClain", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8079646-carol-mcclain", "userReview": "I've read most of Donn Taylor's books, and this one is, I believe one of his best. Set in 1948, he creates a memorable world when life was simpler and recovery from the war hard. Lightning is a serious book, but Taylor has a subtle humor that will leave you laughing out loud from ironic names like Mrs. Telebit,the town gossip, to character descriptions. Mr. Hahn was 4-E during the war. The proof was in the size of his family because the only thing a Mississippi farmer can plant in January is babies. When the FBI is called in and boards at Mrs. Telebits, the investigator says, \"She keeps asking who the murder suspects are, and I keep naming your deputies.\"The plot itself weaves a love story in with murder along with history in a narrative style that's compelling and will keep the pages turning until the end.When you pick up this book--buy some of Taylor's other work. You will not be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Cathy Elliott", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10212726-cathy-elliott", "userReview": "I'm a big fan of Donn Taylor's work and praise his books often. With LIGHTNING ON A QUIET NIGHT, he's produced another powerful read. While it nails the murder mystery category at a comfortable pace, the book has other traits to recommend it - an engaging love story with very real and flawed characters and a historical setting that gave this reader a nostalgic tug on the heart. I loved visiting life in Beneficent with neighbors nosy (Mrs. Telebits) and nice, where heroes joined in the community, and everyone attended the local ball game. It's small town life turned upside down with the murder of a local cheerleader, setting events in motion that reveal a side of folks formerly hidden. The writing is stellar and injected with a clever humor Donn does so well. I was caught up in the tale from first page to the compelling, even moving climax. (Please tell me there is a sequel!) Highly recommended read."}, {"userName": "Sharon Paavola", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10128090-sharon-paavola", "userReview": "Another great book that was so hard to put down! The characters are rich, real, and memorable. As a newcomer to Beneficent, Mississippi, Lisa Kemper seeks to find the good in the citizens who claim to be according to their town's name. The story unfolds and Lisa isn't the only one wondering. The sheriff is questioning the same thing. This quiet, small community is challenged as never before when tragedy hits one of their own. Unusual happenings lead Lisa and her new friend Jack Davis to fear for their lives. Jack grew up in Beneficent and was on the magical, winning basketball high school team of 1942. He struggles with his long held beliefs about his faith and fellow residents. The more the reader discovers the more pages she/he desires to read. A moving, tender, yet traumatic story is a must read!I highly recommend Lightning on a Quiet Night!I was given an ebook copy of this book by the publisher and have given my honest review."}, {"userName": "Barbara Warren", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24723747-barbara-warren", "userReview": "Beneficent, Mississippi is believed by its citizens to be \"A Town As Good As It's Name.\" But Lisa Kemper, forced to live there because her father has opened a new business in Beneficent, finds it dull and boring. She meets Jack Davis and at first she thinks he is as ordinary as the town, but for some reason she is attracted to him.Then Jack finds Callie Rakestraw's body in a ditch. She's been murdered and some people think he might know something about her death. Beneficent is no longer a peaceful, friendly place to live. There's a killer lose and Jack and Lisa are pulled deeper into the mystery as they struggle to find him before he kills someone else. As the danger grows, so does their attraction to each other. Lightning On A Quiet Night has it all, Mystery, Suspense, and a touch of Romance. I had trouble putting it down. This is the first of Donn Taylor's books I've read, but it won't be the last."}, {"userName": "Rachael", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21139362-rachael", "userReview": "This was a good read. It took me a few chapters to get into the read, and the suspense didn't build as much as some other recent books I've read in that genre. However, this was much more than just a suspense read. This was about a group of people who took too much pride in their own good works and learn some valuable lessons. The faith thread wasn't a redemption one, and I found that I enjoyed that as it has been a theme in most books this year. This book had a different feel and writing style that was refreshing. I did have a hard time connecting with the characters in this story. I never really felt as if I knew them well. The plot and faith theme were well written, however. I would recommend this read as it was enjoyable and by no means a \"cookie cutter\" type read. Three and a half stars.I was given this read through book fun for my honest opinion which I have given."}, {"userName": "Linda Marie Marsh", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33245752-linda-marie-marsh", "userReview": "BENEFICENT- doing good; generous; actively kind.

(I'm not a big mystery reader.) Donn Taylor builds a town bent on being good and righteous, so they say. Then he dismantles the town and its characters, showing their underlying nature. The reality that evil is present anywhere, despite good intentions, reminds me of M. Night Shyamalan's The Village.
