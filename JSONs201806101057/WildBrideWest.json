She has been the resident mean girl for the last 6 books. How can she have any redeeming qualities? Ms. Jill has done such a fab job of making me hate Savannah for so long, that it was really hard to get past it. People grow up. People mature. So in the end I don't hate her, but am just kinda tolerant of her. But I do love Billy and the baby.

I must say the prologue is a bit disturbing but it sets up the foundation of why Savannah is the way she is. Savannah was a different person in this book then we are use to seeing. Gone is the bitchy stuck up snob (thank goodness) and in is a kinder more sincerer woman, motherhood definitely agrees with her. Billy was always a easy to be around fun guy that enjoyed parting with the women but that too changed. We have seen these two in prior books and know how they act now we get insight to why they do the things they do. It's a beautiful thing to watch how these two lost souls work with each other to give their child the life it deserves. ***I received a copy from the author in exchange for my honest review.***"}, {"userName": "Cherie Acevedo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8441204-cherie-acevedo", "userReview": "I have to admit that I didn't care for Savannah before this book. However, learning her back story and watching her change in this book, I grew to love her. This story did not have the suspense that I have felt in Ms. Sanders' other books. However, there were many problems that Savannah and Billy have to face--getting to know each other, Billy's father, overcoming self doubts and learning that independence doesn't just mean one. Little Maggie was such a cute little bonus in the book. She brought out the best in both Savannah and Billy. This story shows that even the worst mistakes can be overcome and be made better."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11454197-laura", "userReview": "Wow - I have only read Loving Lauren in this series and I absolutely loved this book. I know I need to read 2-6 of the books, but it was still smooth flowing for me. I even went back to Loving Lauren to refresh my memory of that story and the little portions that I read of Savannah, it's amazing the transformation she made in this book! The chemistry that built between she & Billy was so romantic and funny. And the love they had for Maggie was precious. Great book & can't wait to read the rest of the series.

This book was a little different from the other West stories, but yet the same. Loved the Tracy storyline. Also how Savannah had changed but was the last to see for herself, much like real life. Jill did a great job showing how tough life can be but can also overcome life's challenges if you believe in yourself and trust others."}, {"userName": "Alison Davies", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32584569-alison-davies", "userReview": "I hated Savannah throughout this series, but we find out why in this book...

In this one the \"bad girl\" and \"bad boy\" of this small town finally get together. She finds herself pregnant and wants nothing to do with him until her parents kick her out to make her grow up.

She went from awful to pretty likable, and I really didn't think that could happen. That said, I didn't like this book much.Please remember this review is one reader's opinion. In my opinion, there were a lot of things in this one that made it difficult to read. Although I understood Billy's desire to have Savannah and the baby in his life, the way he went about getting that was far too manipulative and controlling for my liking. I wanted to like him, but that wasn't romantic, it was frustrating and borderline abusive. Why is it that people find it 'romantic' when a man forces his will on a woman? He basically took her hostage, made her vulnerable and dependent on him...And the worst par is that she allowed it. And later, after they had bonded through their forced cohabitation, Billy's reaction to her admitting to having been molested was to immediately have sex with her? I honestly could not believe what I was reading. I get that these books ride on their many many sex scenes, but in that particular case, a snuggling scene would have been far less creepy. Savannah, while likable, was a total disappointment. She was weak and far weaker and more pathetic than I wanted \u2013 and expected - her to be. The fact that Savannah had a baby then got super skinny right after not because she wanted to feel better, but because some teenagers whispered about her was SO disappointing. Instead of loving herself and owning the fact that her imperfect body carried a healthy baby to term, she let others shame her into making herself \u201cskinnier than she ever was\u201d. With all the pressures on women these days to be the perfect size for their man, even after just having had a baby, I was hoping for more from her. We'd seen how young Savannah had always made herself look perfect in order to make people like her, and I was hoping that grown up Savannah might be strong enough to buck that trend and love herself for who she was, not what she looked like. But no, there was no personal growth there at all. She was still all about making sure she could wear pretty clothes and shoes and be sexy. Of course, Billy came home and just LOVED how she was \u201cso small, so perfect\u201d and her \u201chips are not smaller than ever\u201d. Would she still have been perfect to him if she wasn't small? Totally disappointing.While this isn't the worst book I have ever read, and I was happy that Savannah's personality was redeemed, it was definitely my least favorite of the West series."}, {"userName": "A.

Savannah was on my Sh** list for sure until you opened my eyes to her and made me feel like I knew her. You did this in Breaking Travis with Travis as well (I really didn't like him)You took a really hard task and made it seem so easy and for that, as a fellow author I applaud you!Anyway I LOVED LOVED LOVED this novel.Billy is amazing and Savannah grows on you.There story devours you and drags you in.
