The book was excellent and almost written like poetry or song lyrics, in that both strong emotions and powerful situations were telegraphed through stark, short bursts of text. On the surface, this is a story of a Russian immigrant deported from the U.S. as a result of language barriers and Soviet scares of the 1920s, and the seemingly cruel path his life took as a result of that single act. But that isn't really what happened, or at least, that's not what singularly shaped his life. The exile of the book's title has more to do with how the main character finds himself removed from everything and everyone in the world, and how that place of exile defines him. During the time period of this story, 1920- 1948, most of the world experienced some form of dislocation but this main character in many ways excelled in his isolation and exile. The author does a remarkable job of exploring this story as fiction, although in notes at the end she references that it has some basis in a real story. I am grateful for her tenacity in writing the book. I loved it!"}, {"userName": "Melissa Crytzer Fry", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3857699-melissa-crytzer-fry", "userReview": "**3.5 stars**Vanessa Manko is, indeed, a talented new author. I found myself savoring many passages, even though the frequent sentence-fragment style was at first a bit difficult: \u201cHe sips his tequila from the thick, hand-blown shot glass. Its lip of indigo blue is curved, soothing. A spiky astringency. Next, warmth. Voices rise, then soften. He remembers Julia and the children on the day of parting \u2026\u201d (I grew accustomed to this style, eventually, and even realized it created an appropriate detached mood, as well as pitch-perfect characterization.)This heartbreaking story is about Austin, a man separated from his wife and children -- a man who is essentially without a country, through his deportation from the US back to his homeland of Russia. The deportation is the result of a language barrier (and a love of engineering and science) that places an \u201cAnarchist\u201d black mark on his record. He then flees with his wife and children from Russia to Mexico as a result of Russian Civil War (no spoilers here \u2013 this is in the book\u2019s description). And then, his family is admitted back to the US. But he is not. He believes his inventions will gain him re-entry to the US.The book\u2019s theme \u2013 \u201cpaper is stronger than one imagines\u201d \u2013 really hit home, especially since I live in Arizona, a state with notable immigration challenges. Papers. Having papers that prove allegiance to a country. NOT having them. What does it mean? Who are you without them? What kind of life is it to live in constant fear of being \u201ckicked out\u201d? The book subtly brought those questions to mind. It is a story about boundaries and borders and the limits of human endurance.I was most impressed with the incredible job Manko did of portraying the emotional boundaries of humans. How much can we accept and endure before cracking? Once we\u2019ve reached a certain point in a downward trajectory, can we go back \u2013 can we find happiness?Despite my admiration (and the apparent admiration of heavy-hitting authors such as Colum McCann and Siri Hustvedt, who blurb the book \u2013 as well as author Salman Rushdie, who wrote an intro accolade on the Advance Reading Copy I won from First Reads -- something he says he has never before done), I struggled with the pace of this book. And yet it\u2019s a struggle I\u2019m glad I pushed through.And in hindsight I wonder if the author purposely slowed the pace of the first 100 pages \u2013 forcing the reader to experience the same type of struggle \u2026 the same need for patience that was necessary of the main character, Austin. If this was, indeed, her intent, it\u2019s nothing short of brilliant. The story picked up at the 100-page mark, then slowed again until page 200 when it really took off.And the title ... It's such an excellent title. Once you've read the book, you'll understand just why it's perfect.While nonlinear moving timelines generally present no challenges to me, in this book, they didn\u2019t quite work for me. I also felt a deep need to \u201cknow\u201d the wife, Julia, better to make the necessary emotional connections that would have bumped this to a 4 or 5. That said, I was so moved by the latter portion of Austin\u2019s story that I awoke from sleep multiple times, worried about him. That, I believe, is the true mark of a book\u2019s power: did it get under your skin? Apparently \u2026 it did.In the end, if you are a fan of literary fiction that jostles about in time and setting (and even character), and you aren\u2019t driven by high-stakes plots, this could be the book for you. I know I will be thinking about it for a long time to come."}, {"userName": "Melinda", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30751354-melinda", "userReview": "Austin Voronkov is many things. He is an engineer, an inventor, an immigrant from Russia to Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1913, where he gets a job at a rifle factory. At the house where he rents a room, he falls in love with a woman named Julia, who becomes his wife and the mother to his three children. When Austin is wrongly accused of attending anarchist gatherings his limited grasp of English condemns him to his fate as a deportee, retreating with his new bride to his home in Russia, where he and his young family become embroiled in the Civil War and must flee once again, to Mexico.The Invention of Exile deals with themes of labeling, exile and invention and explores how loss reshapes and transforms lives, invention. An absolutely wonderful read. I loved the narrative, so many books remake the same basic plot only to change a few characters or to add minor differences, after a while they all run together not really being able to differentiate between each work. A reader can only tolerate so many love triangles, infidelity, who killed who, imaginary significant other before boredom and mundane sets in. The Invention of Exile is unique and addresses a very interesting premise, also the themes are quite moving.Manko clearly possesses a songlike graceful literary prose which adds to the beauty and depth of the narrative. She also deserves credit regarding strong character development, the reader learns all about Austin, subtly and intimately both emotionally and mentally. About 20 pages into The Invention of Exile , I asked myself the question \nWhat would I do if I were separated from my family, living in different countries all because I was incorrectly accused of something I was innocent of, I was essentially 'labeled' thus creating serious ramifications? How would I deal with the absence, the emptiness and loneliness? All the years lost? Not knowing if I will ever be together with my family only the thread of hope remains.\nAustin is a man desperate, desperate to be reunited with his family, desperate to call a country home. He's in more than exile, the man is in limbo floating with nowhere to fall softly. Loneliness is his constant companion, yearning always a reminder and hope always present. Determination, patience - Austin's weapons along with hope to once again reunite and embrace his family.\n\n\"Separation comes quite suddenly. One day you are as close as two people can be. The next, a line is drawn and you stand on opposite sides, regarding each other across an expanse that is broken and unknown.\"\n\nStinging the reader most is the family love never faltered. All the years apart, the family still longing and hoping to see and be with their father. Julia and the children were in a different type of exile - an exile of the heart which is even more difficult to deal with then distance. The years dragged on but love never faded. \n\n\"She was learning the possibility of, the power of contradiction; one could have a fundamental connection - father, daughter - but still be two mere strangers.\"\n\nIt is an immensely touching story of family, history, and the meaning of home.

The book is set in the history of US/Russian immigration and deportations of the 1920s-1940s but is ultimately not about narrating the history the events or of the characters lives but more about the internal emotion and mental state caused by unjust and uncontrollable forces of governments, bureaucracy and life. I read this book in a single sitting as I was so caught up in wanting to know how the protagonist\u2019s, Austin Voronkov, story would evolve. The emotionally compelling novel had me invested from the start with feelings of anger, sadness and loss although it took me several pages to get used to Manko\u2019s style and tone. The description of events often felt fleeting like I was trying to capture fleeting old memories - the feelings remain but the pieces of what happened remain unclear. While at times this style could be poetic, at others times it was frustrating as I became uncertain if any action would occur - or if any of the events were real. The style did invoke a sense of Austin\u2019s state of mind but it left most of the narrative action up to your imagination. Ultimately this is a book I greatly appreciated rather than fell in love with or simply enjoyed.I received this book as a free ARC through Penguin's First to Read program"}, {"userName": "Rachel Watkins", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2173746-rachel-watkins", "userReview": "Vanessa Manko's first novel is filled with love and loss.

There were moments that were descriptive and well written that were followed by passages that were so long and drawn-out, as if the writer was just trying to use up space on the page.I was intrigued by the overall story, but I felt that it stopped to abruptly. For instance, what happens once he gets back to CT and gets to see his wife Julia for the first time in 14 years? Am I, as a reader, supposed to feel release after he has crossed the border illegally? Also, I am confused about whether the character of Jake was even real. It is never made crystal clear as to whether he was a figment of Austin's imagination and weary mind or if he was a real person.All in all, I spent more time forcing myself to read this book than impatiently waiting to get back to it. Even right at the end, when I only had 10 or so pages left, I grimaced as I picked it up to finish it. I hate giving poor reviews, but this book isn't exciting.

After being unjustly labeled an anarchist and deported from the United States, engineer Austin Voronkov is isolated in Mexico as he attempts to reunite with his family on the other side of the border. While the border is extremely close (at times mere steps away), Austin is determined to gain entry to the U.S. through the proper official channels, and a quest through paperwork and official government offices begins. Any day could be the day when the right appeal is approved, the right patent accepted, the right form stamped. What sounds like tedium raises all sorts of questions -- at what point does bureaucracy become insanity, and at what point are you exiling yourself? How might a relationship, a career, a life be different if you had made a single different choice? Austin teeters on the edge of keeping up the hope that he will be reunited with his family and building a life for himself in Mexico, and the choice is further tormented by idyllic family memories and a sinister government agent who may or may not be stalking him.

Austin leads what seems to be a lonely existence but he does keep busy not just with work but by attending social events like lectures and classes to improve his English, he even joins a few clubs, but deep down there is still this loneliness that you can feel coming from Austin up from off the pages but then he meets Julia.Julia's father died and so Julia's mother lets out an extra room that they have for rent for extra income this financial predicament her mother finds herself in will change Julia's life forever because her mother lets the room to Austin. Becoming quite fond of each other they begin a general flirtation that turns into so much more. Promises are made that one day they will wed once Austin has saved enough for them to have a nice start to their new life together, but like all great love stories there is a catch or a problem that arises just when it seems like everything couldn't get any better and this happens for Austin and Julia when Austin is rounded up with a bunch of other Russians during raids to round up the growing \"Red Menace\". Imprisoned, mistreated, and interrogated Austin is soon lead into a false confession that he is an anarchist. Since Austin actually confessed to this he is automatically deported but Julia decides to marry him before he is to leave and she then travels with him back to Russia. Austin and Julia soon learn that Russia is no longer the Russia Austin used to know but instead is a hot bed of revolution with the communist gaining new ground everyday and so it is not looking good for the Voronkov's to stay there. Fleeing for safety they travel lots of different places but settle in Mexico since it is so close to the United States and Julia is fighting very hard to win their way back into the states but there is so much red tape that they find themselves raising their three children there until finally the children and Julia are given visas and are allowed to return but they have to leave Austin behind in Mexico because he is not granted a visa because of his past. Alone in Mexico Austin suffers greatly from his families absence but he doesn't give up hope as he constantly works on different designs and inventions that he thinks are brilliant enough to earn him a visa to the United States and back to his Julia and their children. Slowly the years roll by and still the answer is always no and slowly but surely Austin goes a bit mad from the stress and loneliness of it all. Pretty soon Austin's children are grown and Leo and Vera have come to Mexico to get their father a visa but again they are denied so they soon take matters into their own hands getting Austin fake papers and then they help him enter the United States illegally. Austin after all these years cannot figure out what held him back for so long and is quite confused as to why he didn't try to cross the border sooner.An emotional read, Austin's decline is hard to take and he is just so far away from his family and on his own it is heartbreaking. Even though Vera and Leo come and get their dad and bring him to the U.S. it is already to late, the damage already done, all that loneliness and stress has driven their father mad and there is no coming back from it, he will always be this way. I will not be talking about the political issues in the book given the political issues involving the U.S./Mexican border presently I don't want a whole bunch of mean comments so I will keep my politics to myself however they are a huge focus in this book.There were a few issues I had with the book, one of them is I didn't like how the book flip flopped so much in setting and time, but this did calm down a bit closer towards the end, I also didn't care for some of the narrative it just seemed to disjointed like it didn't fit which would be fine when it is the stuff about just Austin since he is foreign and doesn't speak English very well but I found this quite a bit throughout the whole book and for me it was just strange and made it harder to really grasp what the author was trying to convey to us, the reader.

Austin Voronkov didn\u2019t start his life as an exile. An engineer, he emigrated from Russia to Connecticut, and fell in love. Before he can get married and start a family, however, the US is seized with a fear of all things Russian, and he is falsely accused of being an anarchist. In the end, he gives in to the demands for answers, accepting a label to make the interrogation stop\u2014and marries and leaves with Julia, the woman he loves. The new couple are so full of love for each other, they can\u2019t imagine being separated. But time has a way of changing such surety, and soon enough Julia is leaving Austin behind\u2014just for a little while\u2014to raise their children as Americans.Soon, they promise, he will join his family in America. But Austin is stuck in Mexico City, the border at once so very close and completely unreachable, as the bureaucracy of the US government refuses to look beyond his anarchist label. Though the two try to keep in touch, and keep the family together, through letters to each other and multitudes of pleading missives to the government officials, words can\u2019t bridge the gap between two hearts, or the two disparate worlds.Something will have to change\u2014something drastic, to free Austin from his stagnation, to restore him to his family and the man he once was.For me, this book moved too slowly, but it perfectly captured the feelings of the characters. This is a slow story, which focuses on feelings and thoughts, and very little action occurs. Like Austin, who is trapped, helpless, working with all his might with little effect, the story loops in on itself, traveling back and forth between the hope of the past and the hopelessness of the present. You can\u2019t help but empathize with him as you think \u2018now something will happen\u2019 and it doesn\u2019t. Because he is thinking the same thing.When events do unfold, they tend to be subtle, layered with meaning and symbolism. And then reflected on in great detail. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell if something is really happening, or how much of events are taking place inside a character\u2019s head. It all returns to the idea of family, both as a group of people and a concept, and what makes someplace a home\u2014nationality, or certain people.One of the interesting things about this novel is that it\u2019s based on the life of the author\u2019s grandfather\u2014and of course, the real issues Russian-Americans had during a point in history when the US government viewed them with distrust.

He meets his wife Julia, but seven years later, Austin is deported partly as a result of his language limitations to defend himself against accusations of being a threat to the US government. Julia follows him and has to renounce her citizenship. They find themselves in the middle of the civil war in Russia, and their escape ultimately takes them to Mexico. Although Julia is eventually granted to re-enter the US with their children, Austin has to stay back and wait for his visa to be approved. Fourteen years later, he's still in Mexico City, fighting tirelessly and manically every day to reunite with his family.ProsI can't remember the last time a novel moved me so much to the core, as Vanessa Manko's \"The Invention of Exile\" did. It was beautifully written, almost lyrical. And although it took me a few pages to adjust to her writing to read it effortlessly, once I got into it, I couldn't put the book down.The level of vividness Manko reaches is one that most writers can only dream to reach one day. She could describe the smallest unimportant moment in such colorful and moving detail that suddenly, if removed, the novel would not be the same.This novel felt very Kafkaesque as Austin's situation in ways resembled the one Joseph K found himself in. I have never sympathized or empathized more with a character than I did with Austin, and my heart was genuinely breaking for him.ConsI don't have many bad things to say about this novel. But if I have to say one thing, it would be the non-chronological retelling of Austin and Julia's life and journey together, until he arrived in Mexico City. The actual plot takes place in 1948, in Mexico City. In addition to this there is a lot of background story being retold by the narrator. It would simply have been easier to follow, had that background story been told chronologically, since we were already jumping back and forth in time. Also, there were moments in the same paragraph when the verb tense switched for no apparent reason.ConclusionI can't begin to describe what a joy it was to read this novel. Just absolutely marvelous! It's been a while since I read Dostojevski or Kafka, but this novel certainly reminded me of them, which is a huge compliment according to me.http://theinspiredpost.blogspot.com/2..."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john", "userReview": "An Impressive Debut Novel Based on the Author\u2019s Family HistoryIn a literary style that is akin to Michael Ondaatje\u2019s exceptional storytelling and prose, without forsaking her own ample literary talent, Vanessa Manko looks back upon her family history in her memorable fictional recounting of it, \u201cThe Invention of Exile\u201d, which is yet another of this year\u2019s notable debut novels. One doesn\u2019t need to pay attention to the lavish praise bestowed upon it already by the likes of Colum McCann and Salman Rushdie, to realize that Manko\u2019s debut is a compellingly readable blend of historical and psychological fiction told admirably in her spellbinding account of Austin (Ustin) Voronkov, a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who becomes an unexpected victim in some of the worst episodes of 20th Century Russian and American history. Separated from his family for nearly a decade and a half, Voronkov barely ekes out an existence as a clock and electronics repairman in late 1940s Mexico City, clinging to his stubborn, almost delusional, belief that his inventions \u2013 a set of technical design sketches \u2013 will finally win him recognition from the American patents office in Washington, D. C. and a long awaited reunion with his wife and children. Wrongly identified as an \u201canarchist\u201d and deported immediately from the United States in 1920, Voronkov embarks on an incredible odyssey that will plunge him and his American wife into the bloody chaos that is Russia in the last throes of a civil war between the \u201cWhite Russians\u201d and the Bolsheviks, the founders of the modern Soviet Union, before finding sanctuary and a chance to lead more or less normal lives in France, and then, Mexico. Manko has written a most ambitious tale, with her settings as distant and unfamiliar as war-torn Russia and late 1940s Mexico City, on a scale one might compare favorably with the likes of Leo Tolstoy and Boris Pasternak, simply for the epic scope of its storytelling. Hers is a riveting psychological portrait of Austin Voronkov, caught accidentally upon the worst tides of 20th Century American and Russian history, and yet never once losing hope that he will be reunited eventually with his wife and children living in America. \u201cThe Invention of Exile\u201d is an important novel in grappling with issues of American immigration and the deportation of undesirables which some may think remains relevant today; regardless, it remains not only one of the finest English language debut novels published this year, but also, among this year\u2019s best works of mainstream literary fiction."}, {"userName": "Wavelength", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1907496-wavelength", "userReview": "The Invention of Exile begins during the time of the Palmer Raids.

There are so many sentences in this book that aren't really sentences at all but merely phrases with periods at the end of them. For example \"His request were minimal. Tooth powder and shaving cream. Rolling papers and drafting paper.\" The use of so much punctuation made the prose very choppy and took away any flow the story might have had. Honestly though, even without the excess punctuation, I just didn't connect to Austin who really is the only character the reader actually hears from. The book is told through a narrator and about half way through the book the narrator switches from using him to using her so we do see a tiny bit from the wife's perspective but we never really hear her voice.I will admit, I gave up maybe two thirds through because the unremitting gloom of the story was just too much. I did read the last few chapters and was dismayed at how abruptly the story ended. Ironically, shortly after returning the book to the library, I came across an essay written by the author about her grandfather in the New York Times' magazine section. Even though I didn't like her book, I felt that the author was a more talented writer who just needed a better editor to illustrate her gifts. My suspicions were confirmed when I read the essay about her grandfather. It was beautifully written and poignant and clearly shows that the author is a writer with promise."}, {"userName": "Mel Raschke", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7345643-mel-raschke", "userReview": "Government policies kept a Russian immigrant, Ustin Voronkov, whose name was changed at Ellis Island to Austin, from living with his American wife, Julia. Although he was non-political, having a background in engineering, he had taken a proletarian job at a factory and frequented a Russian-emigree social club. However, when the U.S. government instituted the anticommunist Palmer Raids, Austin erred while being interrogated and confessed to being an anarchist and thus was deported,along with his wife who refused to be separated from him and in doing so gave up her U.S. citizenship. Their hardships in the Soviet Union did not diminish their love for one another and the two of them subsequently moved to France, and then to Mexico, with the three children born to them. The family of five repeatedly applies for American visas but after many attempts, only the children and Julia are granted the same. Austin thought that in a short period of time he, too, would get a visa but that did not happen and he made a hard living repairing small appliances, such as clocks and radios while sending industrial designs to the U.S. Patent Office. A U.S. government official, \"Jack\" torments Austin by asking who his \"contacts\" are, \"what \"subversive\" activities he is engaged in, etc. Austin has some letter contact with his American children, who eventually meet him in Mexico City, where they try to help him at the U.S. consulate to obtain a visa as he does not want to cross the boarder into the U.S. illegally."}, {"userName": "Summer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21785806-summer", "userReview": "Austin, a Russian engineer, immigrates to Connecticut. By the 1920\u2019s he\u2019s fallen in love with an American, he has dreams and plans for their life together, but everything he hoped for is shattered when the government decides he\u2019s an anarchist and send him back to his homeland, where he isn\u2019t welcome either.Much of the novel takes place in Mexico with an isolated, deteriorating Austin waiting for the day he\u2019ll reunite with his wife and children in the USA. There\u2019s a lot of waiting in this book. A lot. If you\u2019re an impatient reader in love with brisk pacing and action galore, this may not be the story for you, but it\u2019s how the story had to be told, you had to feel stuck there with Austin, you had to feel the frustration and the loneliness and the only way to feel those things was to plod through his everyday uneventful hours with him, those passages weren\u2019t necessarily exciting, but they were honest.The honesty was my favorite thing here, particularly in the final third of the book where Austin\u2019s children were more involved in the plot, and the pace picked up, and I was thinking okay, this is where things will go all Hollywood mushy happy, and my sappy heart did kind of crave that because I liked Austin and his family (I wished more pages had been devoted to his wife), after all they\u2019d been through, I thought they\u2019d earned the Hollywood mushy stuff, but the truth of their situation left a stronger impression on me than perfect happiness would have.I received this through a Goodreads giveaway."}, {"userName": "Shari Wampler", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4529781-shari-wampler", "userReview": "www.thenextgoodbook.comThe Invention of Exile by Vanessa Manko291 pagesWhat\u2019s it about?This novel follows Austin Voronkov, an immigrant from Russia, from 1913 through 1948.

They mentioned that it was about an immigrant from Russia to Bridgeport, CT. I did not read further; I probably should have done so. I know many immigrants from Italy that grew up in Bridgeport so thought it would be interesting to read about a Russian one.The Connecticut segment included years 1913-1920 in pages 1-38. The remainder of the book began with the year 1948 on page 40 in Mexico City and tediously lasted there until page 259 out of 291. The book had to be tedious in order to make a reader feel the life on an exile. The author took the story of a grandfather she never met and imagined how he felt day after year, year after year trying to get back into the US where his wife and children were living. Her imagination and language portray the obsessive depressive feelings that one would have in such a situation. Life goes on and on without ever fulfilling promise but it might start with promise and happiness. At a time when there are so many opinions about immigration concerning parents and children and if families should be broken up to fulfill the law or if executive orders should be put into practice, this book injects feelings of Exile from a parent/husband's viewpoint. Although immigrant Austin is an Engineer/Inventor, he can't invent himself out of exile. So sad a life."}, {"userName": "Glencoe Public Library", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45945599-glencoe-public-library", "userReview": "Austin Voronkov is Russian. He has fled his violent homeland for the safety of Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he falls in love with Julia and works as an engineer. Austin stays connected with his homeland by joining Russian social clubs and lecture societies. In 1920 he and others are arrested at a club and deported under the assumption that they are communist sympathizers. Under duress, Austin inadvertently confessed to being ...an anarchist. He and Julia move to Paris, then other parts of Europe, virtually stateless as they begin their family and try to find a home.Because of the anarchy charge, and deportation, no nation will accept him except Mexico, where they eventually settle. As he struggles to get his family back to the U.S., Austin is advised that sending his wife and children ahead of him will make it easier for him to seek U.S. citizenship. It should only take a month or so, he is told....but it takes much longer for him to be reunited with his beloved family.The writing in this debut novel is excellent, and the author is a wonderful story teller. This is NOT a fast paced beach read that fits into that \"light but good\" category. It is what I call \"a thinker.\" You will want to read this book slowly, appreciate the writing, identify with what Austin is going through. I had so many questions at the end that I want to re-read it, which means it will be great for book club discussions.- Nancy"}, {"userName": "Marissa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18665047-marissa", "userReview": "Goodreads WinThis is about a Russian emigrant who moves to United States looking for a better life but things go astray.

Austin is an engineer and inventor who had emigrated from Russia to Connecticut, where he met and married his but he was deported and labelled an anarchist. Their subsequent travels (back to Russia, escaping the uprising and fleeing to Paris, and then relocating to Mexico) highlighted their lack of fixed address and nationality. However, it was also a difficult part of the story to believe, reconciling the couple's role as impoverished refugees and world travellers (with a young family).The main section of the book focused on Austin's separation from his family when his wife and three children were living in the US and he was waiting for immigration approval to travel from Mexico City. The book raised the question of how much is our isolation from others the result of external forces and how much of it is self-imposed? Does believing in the importance of rules, protocols, and processes make them more valid or does it prevent one from questioning their merit? Does time apart make the separation easier, or more difficult? What is the personal cost of bureaucracy?"}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie", "userReview": "Written in a flowing present-tense, jumping back and forth through time and even from Austin, the main character, to his two children and back, this story aims to capture a particular mental state, I think. It keeps scratching, scratching at the surface of Austin's thoughts until we begin to understand his madness, a madness brought on by a 14-year separation from his family. It raises the question of whether this kind of madness is necessary, then or now, and how much pain bureaucracy can inflict on individuals who wish to be with their families and come to fear those in power. To that extent, I think, it's a very successful book.But because it stays on the surface of Austin's thoughts and is in the distancing present-tense, it it difficult to actually relate to the characters, most importantly Austin. I can see why some are saying it's difficult to get into. It is almost as if the author is trying to respect Austin's privacy, but is denying us the chance to truly get to know him at the same time."}, {"userName": "Lacey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2006264-lacey", "userReview": "*I won this book from goodreads' first reads.I don't really have anything bad to say about this book. The characters were well drawn (although Anarose strikes me as a little pointless), and the writing is really quite beautiful and poetic. Austin's plight is beyond sympathetic, and it sounds more than a little familiar considering the current political climate when it comes to immigration.That said, I just . . . didn't care. Sure, I wanted Austin to get back to his family, but I wasn't dying to know if he managed it and how. And after all the build up and all the \"will he or won't he make it\" back-and-forth-ing for the story to end where it did . . . well, it didn't end. It just stopped. Bad endings can ruin books, and this one was annoying enough for me to consider dropping the whole book down to two stars. But the writing really is good, I'd definitely consider giving Vanessa Manko another shot.

The writing tried to hard to be poetic, but it comes across as scattered. There are so many sentence fragments, to the point of being annoying. The story was repetitive, the dialogue felt strained a lot of the time. I couldn't connect to the characters, and the characters felt disconnected to each other. A couple side characters are introduced and then dropped without any ceremony. One of them might have been a figment of the main character's imagination, but it feels like the author just forgot about it 2/3 of the way in. The ending is such an anticlimactic letdown. I actually kept turning pages, because I couldn't believe that I was at the end. This story had a lot of promise, but unfortunately the writing was too weak to pull it off.

He is an engineer, an inventor, an immigrant from Russia to Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1913, where he gets a job at a rifle factory. At the house where he rents a room, he falls in love with a woman named Julia, who becomes his wife and the mother of his three children. When Austin is wrongly accused of attending anarchist gatherings his limited grasp of English condemns him to his fate as a deportee, retreating with his new bride to his home in Russia, where he and his young family become embroiled in the Civil War and must flee once again, to Mexico.While Julia and the children are eventually able to return to the U.S., Austin becomes indefinitely stranded in Mexico City because of the black mark on his record. He keeps a daily correspondence with Julia, as they each exchange their hopes and fears for the future, and as they struggle to remain a family across a distance of two countries. Austin becomes convinced that his engineering designs will be awarded patents, thereby paving the way for the government to approve his return and award his long sought-after American citizenship. At the same time he becomes convinced that an FBI agent is monitoring his every move, with the intent of blocking any possible return to the United States.Austin and Julia's struggles build to crisis and heartrending resolution in this dazzling, sweeping debut. The novel is based in part on Vanessa Manko's family history and the life of a grandfather she never knew. Manko used this history as a jumping off point for the novel, which focuses on borders between the past and present, sanity and madness, while the very real U.S-Mexico border looms. The novel also explores how loss reshapes and transforms lives. It is a deeply moving testament to the enduring power of family and the meaning of home.", "title": "The Invention of Exile", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693849-the-invention-of-exile", "average": 3.07, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386953874l/18693849.jpg", "reviews": 79, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7353467.Vanessa_Manko", "name": "Vanessa Manko"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Historical", "Cultural", "Novels"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693849-the-invention-of-exile"]}
