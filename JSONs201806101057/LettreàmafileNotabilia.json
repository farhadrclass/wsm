There\u2019s the other part of me that wants to share her message, abounding in beauty, grief, tenderness, joy, life lessons overflowing with wisdom, faith. Most of all, her wisdom, the knowledge and understanding she shares on life; and while this book is a letter to the daughters she never gave birth to, she acknowledges the bond with these daughters of divine creation with the offering of these words.Eighty plus years of trials and life lessons shared, only the ones she found to be useful, not her solutions \u201dknowing you are intelligent and creative and resourceful and will use them as you see fit.\u201dIn prose that is so quintessentially hers, I could hear her distinctive voice saying these words \"I came to understand that I can never forget where I came from. My soul should always look back and wonder at the mountains I had climbed and the rivers I had forged and the challenges which still await down the road. I am strengthened by that knowledge.\u201d Her spirituality is touching without being divisive, her view of the world, of people worldwide.Of all the many things she says, shares, teaches, the words that reached in and grabbed my heart the most was in the chapter Keep the Faith\u201dWhenever I began to question whether God exists, I looked up to the sky and surely there, right there, between the sun and moon, stands my grandmother, singing a long meter hymn, a song somewhere between a moan and a lullaby and I know faith is the evidence of things unseen.Highly recommendedMany thanks to my friend Candi, whose review prompted me to read this tiny book overflowing with love and wisdom.

Here is my offering to you.\"This is a lovely series of Maya Angelou's essays dedicated to all women of the world. She shares some of her most touching life stories, divulges words of wisdom, and muses on those topics which stand as the most relevant and meaningful to her. I love her style and her humor \u2013 she was undoubtedly one classy woman who despised vulgarity and encouraged humility and simplicity. She was forward thinking, self-possessed and conveyed an attitude of hopefulness and positivity. Gosh, I know I could use an extra dose of some of these sentiments from time to time! This is the kind of book one should keep by the bedside, grab it on a bad day, and open up to a favorite passage for a bit of healing. I don't own this book, but that is exactly what I would like to do once I get my hands on my own copy. It's a quick read but also one that can be savored over a period of days as each snippet offers a distinct little lesson in life. \"The ship of my life may or may not be sailing on calm and amiable seas. The challenging days of my existence may or may not be bright and promising. Stormy or sunny days, glorious or lonely nights, I maintain an attitude of gratitude.

You are Black and White, Jewish and Muslim, Asian, Spanish-speaking, Native American and Aleut. You are fat and thin and pretty and plain, gay and straight, educated and unlettered, and I am speaking to you. Here is my offering to you.\u201dSo speaks Maya Angelou in the Preface to Letter to My Daughter, her third book of essays. The book is a slim volume, containing twenty-eight short pieces, which are titled by theme. Examples are \u201cPhilanthropy\u201d, \u201cVulgarity\u201d and \u201cViolence\u201d, which are full of nuggets of wisdom, couched in examples from her own experience. There are more personal memories too, such as \u201cMother's Long View\u201d, \u201cSurviving\u201d, \u201cIn the Valley of Humility\u201d or \u201cMt. Zion\u201d. There are even specific anecdotes about the friends and people she knows, such as \u201cBob and Decca\u201d, \u201cFannie Lou Hamer\u201d and \u201cCelia Cruz\u201d. In these cases it is clear that she feels she has learned a great deal from her friendships with these people, and wishes to impart these insights she has gained. By relating an anecdote from her past, she gets our full attention. Sometimes it is even something painfully embarrassing, where she rather wishes it had not happened. In each case, she seems to hold nothing back. There is a truth which she has learned as a result, and she wishes to share it with us, her readers,\u201cLet's tell the truth to people. When people ask, 'How are you?' have the nerve sometimes to answer truthfully. You must know, however, that people will start avoiding you because, they, too, have knees that pain them and heads that hurt and they don't want to know about yours. But think of it this way: If people avoid you, you will have more time to meditate and do fine research on a cure for whatever truly afflicts you.\u201dWe feel as we read this, that Maya Angelou is wise in a truly ancient sense. In earlier times, many cultures respected the elders in a tribe for their experience, and the younger people looked to them when making their own life decisions. Largely we have lost this ability; this automatic sense of respect. Too often the voices of the elders are lost. But Maya Angelou takes hold of this power again. She is both commanding and humble. She is both searingly honest about herself, and brutally matter-of-fact in her advice,\u201cNever whine. Whining lets a brute know that a victim is in the neighborhood.\u201d This slight volume from 2008 became a bestseller; many people viewing it as an inspirational book. The idea was initially sparked off in the author's mind when she was going through some old boxes of notes and papers, full of ideas for future books and poems. From twenty years' worth of notes written to her friend Oprah Winfrey, Maya Angelou sifted ones which she felt deserved a wider audience, as the truths in them were so universal. They should be shared, \u201cI am convinced that most people do not grow up ... We marry and dare to have children and call that growing up. I think what we do is mostly grow old. We carry accumulation of years in our bodies, and on our faces, but generally our real selves, the children inside, are innocent and shy as magnolias.\u201dThe book can be read straight through, or taken as an essay a day. \u201cEssay\u201d is perhaps rather a grand term for what is often a personal anecdote with a bit of advice thrown in, but then the book does defy categorisation, being part memoir, part poetry and part a sort of guidebook. It is a book of advice, on how to live well, and how to live a life with meaning. It navigates the fine line between homespun philosophy and inspirational religiosity quite well. (Maya Angelou has a very strong faith.) Her skilled writing, her honest compassion, and her intriguing and many personal anecdotes means that this is an appealing read for all. Yes, she identifies and speaks strongly with a Black female voice, but this can be read with empathy, and with significant meaning, by everyone,\u201cAll great artists draw from the same resource: the human heart, which tells us all that we are more alike than we are unalike.\u201dI do have one quibble, and this may be with the publishers. The volume is slight - 162 pages in large print. Of these, 28 are completely blank. Each essay is separated, not only by the rest of the page, plus perhaps the reverse being left blank, but in addition there is a whole extra page in between too. Since some of the pieces are only a couple of pages long in total anyway, this makes the reader feel the page-turn is far too quick. It is distracting. Surely a slim volume is exactly that? Some volumes of poetry are very slight, yet we don't feel \u201ccheated\u201d by the small page-count! But this feels like an attempt to bolster it up. If the publisher really felt it needed more bulk, then perhaps it could have been doubled with an earlier book, or a selection of poems. For this reason it remains at a three star read for me, although it could well be touching four, if more essays had been included - or its presentation had been more honest.Although this book came towards the end of her life, with just one more part of her autobiography (making seven in total) and one more book of poetry afterwards, I would recommend it as an introduction to Maya Angelou's writing, for anyone who has never read any. It is a feel-good book; not as devastating as the first part of her autobiography, nor as complex as some of her poetry. Of course much of her work has this same beautiful conversational tone. The essays or chapters seem to follow her autobiographies, at least at first. It is like a reprise of some of her life events covered in those, plus new ones. She uses them to illustrate her advice for life, and to inspire her readers. In a sense, she seems to be writing a commentary on her autobiographies. This book is a very easy, straightforward yet worthwhile read. Here is my favourite quotation,\u201cYou may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them. Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. Do not complain. Make every effort to change things you do not like. If you cannot make a change, change the way you have been thinking. You might find a new solution.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Marilyn C.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8170584-marilyn-c", "userReview": "4.5 Stars \"You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.\"I listened to Maya Angelou, with her mesmerizing voice, read her inspiring and thought provoking words written for the daughters she never had throughout the world.

I picked it up and settled in a comfy chair with my latte and my soon to be good friend Maya. I was ready for advice, wisdom, love and experiences from a woman who has lived many more lives than I could ever imagine. Not to mention one who puts it so eloquently.It is a craving of 20somethings to be gently advised in life from those who have already gone through the same struggles. It is especially important to 20 something women reguardless of whether we admit it or not. It is the advice that doesn't tell us how to live but more or less how not to that is needed. I am not interested in passive people and have the utmost respect for passionate, strong women(ina non-feminist way=)...which of course has lead me to Maya Angelou's work. Letter to My Daughter highlights experiences in Maya Angelou's life that have helped shape her. They range from topics such as ignorance, racism, education, love, faith, and upbringing. I was drawn in until I realized that a good portion of the chapters were taken from another work of hers , Won't Take Nothing for My Journey Now. Which I had just finished. It wouldnt surprise me if the remaining chapters were taken from other works of her's as well. Needless to say I was a little dissapointed. I wanted something new and fresh. More or less a book directed at women..( hense the title.)

Told in her own inimitable style, this book transcends genres and categories: guidebook, memoir, poetry, and pure delight.Here in short spellbinding essays are glimpses of the tumultuous life that led Angelou to an exalted place in American letters and taught her lessons in compassion and fortitude: how she was brought up by her indomitable grandmother in segregated Arkansas, taken in at thirteen by her more worldly and less religious mother, and grew to be an awkward, six-foot-tall teenager whose first experience of loveless sex paradoxically left her with her greatest gift, a son.\"If you haven't read one of Maya Angelou's bios then don't!

That was a letter to the author's son, this is a letter to the author's daughters, the two published less than a decade apart.Unlike Coates' work, this one did resonate. Maya Angelou, through the way she spoke and the way she wrote, graciously offered something I think all women need and probably a lot of men do, too. I don't know what that thing is but it's like wisdom and also acceptance and also guidance and also grace and also chiding but also humor. She's by turns self-deprecatory and fierce, humble and ridiculous and in sharing her foibles, her opinions, and her moments of triumph, she instills a desire to do better but to not be so hard on oneself when better simply isn't achievable in the moment. I am rarely inspired by authors, especially those who aim to be motivating, but Maya Angelou consistently makes me want to work at being less petty, more compassionate, stronger, more real.I'm still angry her commemorative stamp was wrong, though.Onward, to Book Three!"}, {"userName": "Bree Hill", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26896300-bree-hill", "userReview": "I read half of this on my e-reader and listened to the second half on audio.

Her 'Phenomenal Woman' and 'Still I Rise' are such liberating pieces of poetry.\"Letter to my Daughter\" is a collection of short essays through which Maya Angelou wishes to address the daughters she could never have with little nuggets of wisdom that she found useful in her own life. She shares various anecdotes, sometimes with hilarious undertones and sometimes with blunt viciousness.Raised by two strong and level-headed women, Maya Angelou herself makes for a feisty, daring woman - one who never let her vulnerability overcome her quest for living life bold and fullest.She talks about humility, about giving back, about fighting it out, about making someone else smile, about appreciating, about gratitude, about being free. She also speaks about her opinion on 'rape', about how attributing it to a power struggle trivializes the sexual violation that it actually represents. She speaks about independence and self-reliance, about her equation with her mother and how mutual respect is all that is required for two people to survive one relation. She speaks about violence and sarcasm and vulgar humor, about how indulgence in offensive humor makes us complicit in oppression of the already weaker sections of the society, about how taking little stands can go a long way for someone else. She speaks about love and faith in the tenderest possible manner.My favorite chapter was the one called \"In Self Defense\". Angelou recounts an incident about how a white woman tried to bully her and put her in place and how she had to stand up for herself because sometimes you must. You must decide where to draw the lines. You must decide where to not give in to irrational bullying. You must be able to stand up in self defense because you'd not always have someone to stand up for you. You must come to your own rescue.There is a particularly sensitive chapter on death where she reminisces her friends and her special bond with Coretta Scott King and I'd like to quote from that chapter here -\"When I find myself filling with rage over the loss of a beloved, I try as soon as possible to remember that my concerns and questions should be focussed on what I learned or what I have yet to learn from my departed love. What legacy was left which can help me in the art of living a good life?Did I learn to be kinder,To be more patient,And more generous,More loving,More ready to laugh,And more easy to accept honest tears?If I accept those legacies of my departed beloveds, I am able to say, Thank You to them for their love and Thank You to God for their lives\"In another chapter on National Spirit, she writes about America, of what it must mean to Americans, about how the educated should try to uplift the lesser privileged, in which she speaks about the necessity of intolerance towards vulgarity and more tolerance towards freedom. I believe through all my heart that what she says is befitting to any nation and it's lovers. The feeling of nationalism should be an essence of humanity and compassion and an undying but not blind love for the nation, where disappointments are worked upon collectively to strengthen the belief in one's country.I found this little book, a package of healthy wisdom, not preached but lived through the phenomenon that was Maya Angelou, to be a beautiful and a heart-warming tribute to all the women who ever lived. A book meant for re-reads for sure."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3364520-rachel", "userReview": "I guess I haven't really read Maya Angelou before so I may not have acquired the taste for her writing and the requisite knowledge of the form to understand this book.

Though this book is mostly prose, the stylization of the prose is not my favorite (or perhaps I should say it is not in my comfort zone). The book is bite sized so I read it quickly once I started, but by the end I didn't and still don't know what to think of what I read.

The first few seemed to progress in time and together tell a story of Angelou's life. At the outset I thought I would like it because it seemed to consist of bits of empowering wisdom passed on from Angelou's life experiences. These short anecdotes I enjoyed. However, as the book progressed, the bits got less focused and I became less interested in continuing to read it. The stories or bits felt oddly disjointed and increasingly random. Then there were greater jumps in time and place and individual writings started mid-thought.My tolerance for the book finally ended with a writing about violence in politics, \"National Spirit.\" The piece was trope, exactly what a politician would say, meaningless nothing about how we all should be better. I read on past this but skimmed and skipped and didn't put in much effort."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15292836-maria", "userReview": "I started this book a long, long time ago. Things became really hectic, and I wasn't able to finish it. Well yesterday was finally the right time to sit down and read it (somewhat again). I ended up starting over and I read 79 pages in one sitting. Today I read the remaining pages. I loved it. I love Maya Angelou. Her style is one of my absolute favorites.This book isn't like the storytelling in her autobiographies that are loved by so many. Rather it's a collection of her experiences, poetry, commencement address, and her other thoughts on life. What resonated most with me is how she intertwines her experiences with real life advice. Her advice never has the feel of being preachy or demeaning. It feels as it's coming from her heart. It makes you think and examine your life, who you are, who you want to be.There are many beautiful passages in here, and this provided a broader exposure to me of her writings. I enjoyed getting inside her head and learning that this great, amazing woman is so much like me, like all of us. One of my favorite quotes is in the opening letter:\"You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them. Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud. Do not complain. Make every effort to change things you do not like. If you cannot make a change, change the way you have been thinking. You might find a new solution.\"I see myself rereading this and discovering new meanings for me as I grow.

I always do a better job when it is still fresh in my mind.This slim volume has substance and unusual topics. What a remarkable life Maya Angelou lived and yet, how humble and thoughtful in her musings. I was especially struck by several chapters. I loved that she echoed my feelings on vulgarity. \"We need to have the courage to say obesity is not funny and vulgarity is not amusing. Insolent children and submissive parents are not the characters we want to admire and emulate. Flippancy and sarcasm are not the qualities which we need to include in our daily conversations.\" I keep hoping for a return to manners and civility. I'm personally tired of the language and shocking behavior so prevalent today. \"If we tolerate vulgarity, our future will sway and fall under a burden of ignorance. It need not be so. We have the brains and the heart to face our futures bravely. Taking responsibility for the time we take up and the space we occupy. To respect our ancestors and out of concern for our descendants, we must show ourselves as courteous and courageous well meaning Americans. Now.\"I also appreciated what she writes about rape. She is not afraid to voice her opinion contrary to what others may think. \"But there is one matter which calls me to adversarial attention. Too many sociologists and social scientists have declared that the act of rape is not a sexual act at all but rather a need, a need to feel powerful...Possibly some small percentage of the motivation which impels a rapist on his savage rampage stems from the hunger for domination, but I am certain that the violator's stimulus is (devastatingly) sexual.\" I loved how she wrote about how for the last 30 years, she has exchanged notes & flowers with Coretta Scott King on April 4th - her birthday and the day Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated. I loved the stories of her grandmother, her mother, her dinner in Morroco, her commencement address, etc.A book to be treasured."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1082166-elizabeth", "userReview": "Go ahead and judge me, I listned to this as an itunes audio file.
