Here's why: most of book four was told as flash backs and back stories, not enough moving the story forward. Don't get me wrong, I'm still invested, if for no other reason than to finally have an acceptable end to this nightmare or at least a reasonable hope of a new normal for the Talbot family, their friends and all of humanity.I'm beginning to have issues with the repetitive phrasing and use of words. I know there are many ways to describe body fluids other than viscus, even if he is describing fluid coming from the heart, liver or intestines. Also, saying \"Ya think?\" every time a statement is made to the obvious, get's old.Another issue is the author having to explain repeatedly what is obvious to the reader, for example: 'Are all you Talbots programmed in Smart ass?\" BT said with exasperation. The fact that Mark used exasperation and keeps doing that during the dialogue get's cumbersome for the listener.There is still a lot of action, but I think to have an eight book arc is a bit much for this story. I'm currently on book 5, Alive In A Dead World and so far, it's no different than book 4. I have a strong hunch the rest of the series will be much of the same fodder.Zombie Fallout should have been 1 or 3 books at the most and then I think, Mark should have go on to other stories, even sidetracking off other memorable characters.I'm still in for the long haul like I said, but I wish the story had ended with book 3 and gone out on top instead of they way it's ending up which is mired in unoriginality. Three solid stars because the the first 3 books make you want to finish the entire 8 book series!"}, {"userName": "Cindysnitily", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7100630-cindysnitily", "userReview": "This is a post-apocolyptic zombie/vampire masterpiece.

I think the story could have been tied up neatly with a trio of books, or at most - with this fourth. At this point I'm more than a little burned out and the story is starting to seriously drag.The pros? Less vile, disgusting stuff. Or maybe I'm just used to it now. At any rate, the puking (the actual puking in the book, which I complained about the volume thereof in book three) seems to have died down a little. The fart and poop jokes are still there, but seem less constant. There are a few new characters, one of which is a pretty cute little six year old girl that immediately warms the heart of Mike's dad.\u201cPretty lady. Why are you crying? My mom says crying makes your asscarrots run,\u201d Angel said.\u201d There's no crying in the zombie apocalypse!!Ahem. Er, we also get to know Mike's family a little bit more, and they're an interesting group. It helps explain how/why Mike is the way he is, as well. There's very little more of Tommy, and while I'm happy for any sighting, this one makes it to the cons list as well.The cons? If you were reading this series because you adored Tommy, you can stop reading now. I hate what happened to him, and am uncertain at this point whether I'll read further books. He was pretty much the entire reason I read this one. I also feel like what happened with him was a little gratuitous - just designed to whip up more reader frenzy against Eliza and keep people reading from a revenge angle. It didn't work for me; my head spun off a dozen different ways they could have worked this angle while still keeping Tommy as he was - crazy poptart flavours in his magical bag of holding and all.Additionally, the story is getting more and more preposterous with each iteration and my suspension of disbelief is seriously strained at this point. There are some real problems with repetition of situations, ways you can get trapped by zombies, ways you can get threatened by a crazy vampire, ways you can put your family in danger, ways your dog can stink up a car... haven't we seen all this by now? The \"new\" material in this book is probably stuff that could have covered a 35 page \"afterword\" in the last book. It's just getting a bit tedious.While I still enjoy the Talbot family in general (Tracy, the wife, in particular) and am curious about their fate, it's all getting a bit stale by now. I like the author's sense of humour, and his follow-through with getting this many books on a topic written and published - which is why it gets three stars from me. Die-hard zombie fans will still like this one. People looking for a little more meat on their story bones, even with zombie stories, might be disappointed here."}, {"userName": "Gadget Girl", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23283946-gadget-girl", "userReview": "If you've been reading my last 4 reviews of this Zombie Fallout series you will know Im addicted to this brilliant series, its my alltime favorite. Mark is the master of the zombie fiction.Each book has something quite different thrown into the mix and Book #4 is no exception. Still written in journal form but this time everyone is writing in it so we are getting some different point of views. I dont normally like characters jumping around from first person point of view; but Mark has made it work seamlessly into the plot. Book #4 wow the best yet, another zombie masterpiece; Mike and BT have to be my favorite characters ; everyone needs a BT in the family and Henry of course.Mark draws you into the whole storyline with brilliant psychological terror, which will get your adrenaline going throughout the whole book #4....if not..then check your own pulse..are you dead? Book #4 picks up the pace again as we follow several groups of the Talbot family with yet again a fantastic combination of humour and Mike-ism's. Mikes group are off to save Alex's group from Eliza and the plot thickens as they run into more trouble with a redneck bible group with strange powers and their own method of justice.BT, Mikes daughter and of course; the famous farting hound Henry secretly follow Mikes group...just incase he runs into trouble...no way! Plus Tracey and her rescued group run into their own problems introducing some new characters to the mix. They all finally meet up... Im not giving anything else away....for the amazing showdown with Eliza who once again has hunted Mike down. He risks everything; the ultimate sacrifice to save his family and friends; as he faces Eliza and his arch enemy Durgan with some help from Tommy...but is it really help?Yet another unputdownable read!I love how this series has grown from slow zombies with the bug evolving to the more intelligent tracker, speeder zombies to vampires and now with ancient Indian witch doctors thrown into the mix. It gets more disturbing and creepy as this brilliant series evolves. I didn't see that ending coming. Just brilliant!I cant wait to read book #5 and #6."}, {"userName": "Theodore", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8621635-theodore", "userReview": "This series is getting downright convoluted in nature and I mostly get infuriated when stories get too convoluted; it generally reads to me that the author is trying too hard. In this case though... I'll make a huge exception!The book becomes more and more complex with various twists and turns appearing throughout the title. As soon as you think that you have gotten a good enough grasp of the series something new is introduced which adds a twist to the series but makes it a bit more harder to follow. I find myself feeling sorry for the Talbots, they seem to can't catch a break... With all that being said though, I can't help but be gripped by the entire book... I will see this book through to the end come hell or high water and anyone who has gotten this far in the series would probably agree.Again this series shine mostly due to the characters whose vantage point we read from. The neurotic germophobe that is Mike Talbot, his formidable and dedicated wife Mrs. Talbot, the loveable Tommy, the dangerous Thomas and the vicious Eliza all brings about their own special touch to the book. Their differing vantage points are fascinating to view from and will have you cracking up or on the edge of your seat with excitement.The series thus far has been just plain fun to experience, with this one only adding to it. It doesn't take itself too seriously but it isn't a complete joke either. A young crowd will certainly love these books.P.S. The book once again ends with a cliff hanger...."}, {"userName": "Balkron", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27874245-balkron", "userReview": "My Rating Scale:1 Star - Horrible book, It was so bad I stopped reading it.

I\u2019m immensely enjoying all these and rapidly listening to them all in a row. I gave this one a 4 instead of a 5 like I gave the previous books. I feel that there are some glaring inconsistencies:... heads up, spoilers ahead. 1) the Talbots\u2019 path was about 4 months since the start of the apocalypse. Since they parted was from the Alex and Paul group they traveled to Tracy\u2019s mom\u2019s, stayed at army base which included a lengthy hospital stay (about 1.5 months there), and the traveled to Mike\u2019s dad\u2019s house. They accomplished a lot. However when we catch up with Alex and Paul their story was only a few weeks since they last parted Mike before the groups meet up. Huh? How\u2019s that possible?2). I recall in the first book it was stated that when Mike and Paul went different ways that Mike never knew what happened to Paul and whether or not he made it to his family. Looks like the author changed his mind. I think he should make some adjustments to the first book. 3). When Mike was turned into part vampire he was talking about feeling empty, not human anymore, and sentiments about questioning his goodness. However, When Tommy was part vampire none of these concerns ever came up. I have forgotten the others I noticed. Another thing that was irritating was how easily Eliza happily agreed to Mike and Durgen fighting. What?? No way. Seems like she would\u2019ve wanted the opportunity to kill Mike herself. This was still an enjoyable listen. It just had some disappointing plot holes in comparison to the previous books in the series."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54357399-megan", "userReview": "I was torn between 3 and 4 stars. Given I'll likely not continue on with the series, I'm going to give it 3.While I like the overall story, the splinters of subplots are starting to get very convoluted to the point where I wonder if it's worth continuing on with the series. It seems, that with all of these background subplots on Eliza and the Talbot's, preexisting to the Zombie Fallout itself, it is a bit much. Sure they are entertaining, but again, there are just so many. And now with the big twist at the end, I can't quite see where it'll go from here. Wondering if this is the make or break book of the series. I know there are at least up to 10 in this series as well as a spin-off or two. Problem is, just because a series of characters has a long run + spin-offs, doesn't mean it's necessarily good.
