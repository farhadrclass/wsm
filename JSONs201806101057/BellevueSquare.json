I\u2019d love to have been a fly on the wall at the jury deliberations, just to hear some convincing arguments for the book\u2019s quality.It\u2019s not bad \u2013 it\u2019s certainly readable. And I enjoyed the descriptions of Toronto people and landmarks. But it\u2019s missing some essential ingredient to make it really\u2026 special. Jean Mason, a Toronto bookstore owner, hears that someone who looks exactly like her has been seen several times in Kensington Market.(For those who don\u2019t know Toronto, the market is a bohemian neighbourhood on the edge of Chinatown, now frequented by a mix of hipsters, vegans, artists and the occasional derelict. Fun fact #1: my grandparents owned a house on the corner of Bellevue Square, so while growing up, my brothers and I would often play in the park. Fun fact #2: I\u2019m currently writing this review a few blocks away from the square!)Jean investigates and soon enough meets some people who tell her they\u2019ve seen her doppelganger, someone named Ingrid Fox.Suddenly a few of these people start disappearing. Has this Ingrid killed them? And if so, is Jean next? Redhill has woven a complex narrative that will keep you on your toes. As some details were revealed, I found myself rereading certain passages and questioning what Jean has told us. It helps to know that Redhill is also the author of a series of mystery novels, which he writes under the pen name of Inger Ash Wolfe. And it also helps to think of the title, Bellevue Square, very carefully. What associations does the name \u201cBellevue\u201d have?The author, who\u2019s also a poet, offers up some startling images. For instance, here he is describing a statue of the actor Al Waxman (see picture above), who starred in the long-running TV series The King Of Kensington, in the square:New faces sit on the bench beside the white-capped Al Waxman statue. Bronze is a cruel material. It makes you look that little bit deader. \u201cMakes you little that little bit deader\u201d? So true. And it\u2019s an image that nicely dovetails with the book\u2019s themes too.I didn\u2019t anticipate where the novel went in the second half, but it made me consider the first half a bit of a cheat. Especially the murders or disappearances, which aren\u2019t sufficiently explained. Still, there are some suspenseful scenes, some mind-bending ones where you\u2019ll question what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not, and a couple of fascinating bits of information involving science. In the author notes at the end, Redhill tells us that this is the first book in a projected triptych of novels called Modern Ghosts. That\u2019s another clue to how we can read the book, I suppose. But I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m intrigued enough to read the next two."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6797406-anna", "userReview": "2.5* - This story starts with a great idea but quickly moves toward the bizarre. By the time I was a third of the way in, it became apparent that this was going in a different direction than what I was expecting so I adjusted my expectations and read on but I could never really catch ground with this book. I have two main issues. The first is the rambling nature of the storytelling. This may not be an issue for some people but it became irritating to me as the book progressed. My second issue was the style of writing (not the quality - just the style). It was written in such a simple basic style that I had to resist the urge not to just skim over the text. I probably would have if it wasn't for the fact that I was desperately trying to connect with the story. No luck there. I was off balance for the whole book. I never knew what was real and what wasn't. I'm sure that was a deliberate technique on the author's part and he was very successful with that but it prevented me from engaging with any of the characters. I have to give the author credit for the concept and the many layers of story he constructed to write this book. I don't know how he kept track of it himself.

It is currently long listed for the Giller prize and has many favourable reviews. It started out for me with an interesting premise. A woman sees her identical self in the vicinity of a market and adjacent park in Toronto, after a few others have mistaken her for this person. This vision, if it is one, may be a doppelganger, often said to forecast imminent death in folklore. Does this identical person actually exist or is it all a hallucination? After some internet searches I learned this condition is a rare medical phenomenon thought to be connected with seizures or schizophrenia. It takes us into the mind of Jean Marsh, and her thought processes and symptoms of mental illness. So far so good, but then it became increasingly bizarre. I kept reading to the end, struggled with the story, but sorry, just don't get it.

It's also a Scotiabank Giller Prize Finalist.The premise? A customer in Jean Mason's bookstore tells her that she has a double, a doppelganger. Jean is intrigued and heads to Bellevue Square (a park) to see if she too can see this woman.I was intrigued by the idea of the double. And my interest was further piqued by this early line...\"I put the phone away and at that exact moment a woman I would later be accused of murdering walked into my shop.\"And with those two pieces, I thought I was in for a mystery. And I was - but the book certainly did not unfold in any way I could have predicted. There is so much more to Jean's tale. The facade that Jean presents to the world - and her family - has cracks in it.Redhill's writing in Bellevue Square is fiendishly clever. The reader must pay close attention as Jean's world turns on a dime. What is truth? What is fiction? There is no way to tell as we see everything from Jean's viewpoint - and she is most definitely an unreliable narrator. Her mind is frightening, yet brilliant.What I really enjoyed were the conversations and interactions between Jean and those that frequent Bellevue Square. While somewhat nonsensical at times, these interactions seem the closest to 'real' for Jean, often overshadowing the relationship with her husband and children.Take your time reading Bellevue Square. There is much to consider as Jean seeks answers. There are hints and references dropped along the way that had me forming in my mind what I thought was 'the answer.' And I was wrong. I think I hooted out loud when I realized what was happening in the final chapters. I don't want to say anymore and spoil the book, but overlapping is a word I'll throw out there. I am still not sure if I completely 'got' everything that Redhill has woven into his book, as some of it is a bit confusing. In an interview with the Globe and Mail, Redhill mentions that Bellevue Square explores loss and \"is about the surprising (and disturbing) plasticity of the self and what happens when the sense you've made of things stops making sense.\"Bellevue Square is set in the streets and area around Kensington Market in Toronto. Redhill has lived and worked in the Toronto area for many years and his descriptions benefit from his first hand observations. References to Canadiana - Dominion grocery stores, Tim Hortons, Shopper's Drug Mart will be familiar to Canuck readers.Inger Ash Wolfe is Redhill's nom de plume. I was delighted to find references to the Hazel Micallef books. And it was only on reading the acknowledgements that I discovered Bellevue Square is \"part one of a Modern Ghost, a triptych.\" I will pick up the next book, as I truly want to see where and what could transpire next.Thought provoking and fiendishly clever."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40928988-kim", "userReview": "This messed with my head.

To me, Bellevue Square was a resounding success in this way. The ending was insane. But wasn't that the point?? I thought it was brilliant.One thing I can't stop thinking about -- and I'm walking up to the line of spoilers here -- is that Redhill used his own alternate name (Inger Ash Wolfe) as a character name in the book.

One would think the premise would carry the story to at least mediocre standing. Sadly, this does not happen. While there is some amusing antics along the way starring the unreliable first-person character of Jean and her 'parkie' pals, the reader is let down. Some would cry but how? After all the novel did win the Giller Prize. True enough. Well the reader is led to believe Jean is either mentally ill, a bored housewife seeing things, has a brain tumour in such a location that affects her sense of self, OR there really is an elaborate conspiracy in the works. Despite this being the first in a trilogy there is supposed to be some satisfaction for the reader in how the first book ends. It still appears Jean is either crazy as a loon, her doppelganger is real and she simply wants to kill it, or maybe Jean isn't even Jean. The reader has no idea. And it is the ambiguity of the ending I cannot forgive. Had Redhill given clear evidence of a master conspiracy only the nutter Jean can see while still holding back on the why leaving the depth of the conspiracy open to play with for the following two books I could live with not only the ending but the entire novel.

Jean Mason has a doppelganger. At least, that's what people tell her. Apparently it hangs out in Kensington Market, where it sometimes buys churros and shops for hats. Jean doesn't rattle easy, not like she used to. She's a grown woman with a husband and two kids, as well as a thriving business, and Toronto is a fresh start for the whole family. She certainly doesn't want to get involved in anything dubious, but still . . . why would two different strangers swear up and down they'd just seen her--with shorter hair furthermore? Jean's curiosity quickly gets the better of her, and she visits the market, but sees no one who looks like her. The next day, she goes back to look again. And the day after that. Before she knows it, she's spending an hour here, an afternoon there, watching, taking notes, obsessing and getting scared. With the aid of a small army of locals who hang around in the market's only park, she expands her surveillance, making it known she'll pay for information or sightings. A peculiar collection of drug addicts, scam artists, philanthropists, philosophers and vagrants--the regulars of Bellevue Square--are eager to contribute to Jean's investigation. But when some of them start disappearing, it becomes apparent that her alleged double has a sinister agenda. Unless Jean stops her, she and everyone she cares about will face a fate stranger than death.", "title": "Bellevue Square", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33595663-bellevue-square", "average": 3.27, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1494700995l/33595663.jpg", "reviews": 503, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/48194.Michael_Redhill", "name": "Michael Redhill"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33595663-bellevue-square", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36954351-bellevue-square", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36228248-bellevue-square", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1718914.Consolation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/524620.Martin_Sloane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18738894-saving-houdini", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/764782.Fidelity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/524605.Goodness"]}
