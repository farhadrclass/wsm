It's quite impossible how different they are. They're too fucking similar to be different. I can't do anything about it though because I guess what the author says is true. Sucks big time.------------I bought this book (in hardcover, for only $2) because of the mere fact that Patterson wrote it. Patterson introduced me to the world of Crime-mystery-thriller novels, so when I saw this months ago I bought it in an instant without even reading the synopsis at the back. I had no idea that this was a prequel of his young-adult series, Maximum Ride. I was a huge fan of Maximum Ride then, and I'm sure I enjoyed the series as a whole. After reading a few pages of this, I realized that Max was the same character as the one from the MR series. I did a little research and confirmed my speculations. All I can say is that I can't believe I'm reading the prequel to the series that I loved when I was younger.Frannie and Kit were the adult main character in this novel. They were the usual main characters that Patterson writes, and they were really enjoyable. The best character of course would still be Maximum. I liked her before, and I still like her now. The author also decided to add in Icarus, another member of the Maximum Ride crew. I'm not sure if the others were also a part of the crew. I've read the MR series years ago so my memory is not that fresh anymore. Back to Fran and Kit. Their relationship felt forced and unbelievable, but aside from that, they were well developed characters. They were really likable, so that was good enough to keep me interested on what's going to happen to them.Plot wise, it feels more YA than Crime/Adult. The plot was a bit shallow, and really similar to the MR series. I know this is a prequel, but the synopsis wasn't that obvious. Aside from the name Max, nothing else screamed Maximum Ride to me. The plot wasn't that cliche, but it could've been done better. The character development beats the plot, and that's not always a good thing.3.5/5 stars. I rounded this one up because I was such a huge fan of the MR series. This was not a bad novel. In fact, this novel was a bit fast paced and interesting. It just didn't have that adult writing of Patterson feel to it. Maybe the fact that I've read the YA series influenced my reading impression of this, but I've read better works of Patterson. I'm going to read the sequel to this, and also the last book of the YA series(coming out this 2015). Patterson will always be the reason why I love the crime genre, in reading at least. I still find that I enjoy crime movies more than novels, but if the crime novel is good enough, then I'll still feel the enjoyment one way or another."}, {"userName": "Afsana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2211610-afsana", "userReview": "I have read this and I am not ashamed to state I enjoyed itI see that there are several reviews here that suggest that to have enjoyed this book or james pattersons books shows a low reading levelThat is so condesceding.

Whilst the likes of Dan Brown have been the most recent perpetrators of this populism, Patterson has certainly been the more consistent of the two and quite arguably the worst offender of all modern hacks. I must surmise that even the combined powers of Dickens, Poe, Kafka or the most literate modern storytellers could not bend Patterson into writing a competent tale should they slap him a thousand times in the face with their own manuscripts.The plot is an absolute mess having to do with the secretive genetic manipulation of a little girl and the two protagonists who find themselves tangled up in the whole scheme and whose mission becomes to free the girl from her experimental captivity. How that happens, one can only hope to care a little less about as the \"story\" unfolds with all the grace and weight of a weekday television drama. Pathetic romance between the tale's heroes degenerates into being laughably absurd at its worst moments (and soap opera-esque at best), the action throughout is completely lacking in suspense or thrills; but perhaps the worst offense of them all can be summed up in the cartoonishness of the narrative, chock-full of plot turns so contrived as to make M. Night Shyamalan at his worst blush. The characters are developed with as much interest as one might put into stapling together a cardboard box and much of the inanity takes place over the modern mass market fiction phenomena of brisk three-seven word dialogue sessions, which can go on for seeming pages at a time with little to no cognitive progress made, narratively-speaking. One would assume even a writer of Patterson's lowly capabilities could at least muster up some sort of detail when describing his characters, settings or set pieces... yet we get about as much an impression of such vitals as one might make of the Taj Mahal through the bottom end of a foggy glass.An Amazon.com reviewer summed this novel up perfectly with the headline of his review: \"When the Wind Sucks.\" To say a Berenstain Bears book is written with decidedly more wit, charm and readability would be uttering the very least of truths in regards to Patteron's immeasurably awful writing. Spare yourselves this waste of paper and introduce yourselves to literature worthy of your time and mental faculties. Mass market drivel like this undoubtedly contributes greatly to the sharply declining literacy of our society, even if its pedestrian characters, Bruckheimer plot and by-the-books action do at least make for the most pathetically lazy of easy, diet reads.For those who actually enjoy great, well-written literature, I can't warn you away from this book or its brand of modern \"mass market appeal\" writing strongly enough. Avoid at all costs and your IQ will certainly show no end of gratitude."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1074042-amanda", "userReview": "James Patterson has exactly the same writing style as Dean Koontz. There are hits and misses. This, most definitely, was not a hit.I've read a few of his other books, mostly the ones meant for children and young adults, so I wasn't really surprised by the caliber of language. However, this book is supposed to be for adults and still, he has a pedestrian way of telling the story. The book flashes in and out of first and third person perspective, among three people, one of them being Max, the girl with bird wings. What should have been an interesting, pulse accelerating story, turns into something slightly boring just because of the way he tells it. Not only does the perspective thing make the story clunky, his sentences are just sub par.

It is similar to Maximum Ride, but not at the same time. Frannie O'Neil is depressed after her husband, David, died. She's not sure who murdered him, but when Kit Harrison, an FBI agent, shows up at her vet hospital with an interesting case, things start going horribley wrong. First, 2 people have been murdered in the last 2 weeks. Both doctors who studied biology and were suspects of a mysterious group of rebel scientists who experimented on humans. Then, Frannie meets Max, an extrodinary girl with extrodinary powers. She has wings and can fly.

Modern-day laboratory chimeras (I think this book came out around the time of the tv show, Dark Angel--similar themes) that are grown and manipulated inside unknowing mothers-to-be. Sounds pretty good, right? That's about as fascinating as it gets. I had hoped it would have explored more of how the process was done and the scientific background, but there was none. Essentially, a girl (who has wings!) from the project escapes and is on the run in the wilderness of Colorado. A wayward FBI agent and a local vet team up to discover the truth of the murders and events that seem to tie back to this girl.

I'll definitely be trying a few more of his books.

She's a person not a piece of meat.It switches between third person and 1st person (Franny's POV), which was really disorienting when it moved between the chapters.When Kit and Franny think they're about to die the next they decided the most reasonable thing to happen if for them to finally have sex... like really? You would think there would be more important things on their minds like surviving, what's going to happen to the kids, whether the company is going to get away with all the crap they've done.I wasn't a huge fan of the narrator.Things I did like:The description of what exactly made Max bird like other than her wings (in Maximum Ride they only have wings), she has feather down her legs that work as a tail feather, she would lay eggs instead of giving live birth.The epilogue, it was very heart touching.

Like a McDonald's burger it goes down easy, you know what you're going to get and it is pleasant but forgettable. I can see how James Patterson is a top selling author. He goes for the mass market. I found his style breezy and lean, his two or three page chapters easy for frequent stops and starts-- very handy no doubt for bored commuters who bring a book along for the ride. Style is reminiscent of another big selling author, Michael Crichton, with fast action plot twists, and the usual mix of sexual attraction, mano to mano fisticuffs, gunshots and a generally happy ending.Characters were a bit on the cardboard cutout side, but not bad. If this was a TV show it would be a mediocre one season series on the Sci-Fi channel."}, {"userName": "Stargirl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4085939-stargirl", "userReview": "I love Max and her story but something doesn't ring right in this adult spin-off of the series. The adults characters sound wrong somehow.

It either Set itself up for the beginning of one of James Patterson's other series, or was written with the idea that this would be a sort of Prologue to that series. If you don't know what series I'm referring to, it's the \"Maximum Ride\" series. You're probably wondering how this is a sort of Prologue to that series, and I am here to elaborate. It's actually in plain sight, hell, even on the first pages. You don't need to play detective and try to decrypt the pages and relate them to the other series. Basically, the book starts with one of the main characters running from some guards who are trying to catch her. This character's name is Max, and she's an 11 year old girl with blond hair, green eyes, a stronger build than pretty much any 11 year old girl, and...wings. Yep, she has wings. See what I mean? Moving on from that, though, we are given a few main characters. Max being one of them, but there's also Frannie O'Neill and Kit Harrison. Frannie is a veterinarian in Bear Bluff, Colorado, who encounters Max twice in the beginning of the book. She has no knowledge of her origin, and tries to set out to find her again during her free time. Kit Harrison, on the other hand, is an FBI Agent who freely traveled to Colorado to work on his own case without the approval of the FBI. He plays off as a hunter, though, and he runs into Frannie and even stays in her cabin behind her clinic. The fact that he's a hunter (in her eyes) enrages Frannie, but later they learn more about each other and become friends. Finally, Max is still in hiding from the guards who were chasing her, who we find out are from a secret laboratory called the School, who do heavy experimenting, primarily on children (again, see the relation to \"Maximum Ride\"). While hunting for her, Frannie and Kit manage to capture Max, and find out that she wants to try a break into the School and save the rest of her \"Flock.\" And thus, the story goes on from there. Now, I'm not big romance guy, so the fact that there was serious romance between Frannie and Kit (especially in the beginning-middle) didn't really appeal to me, but what are ya going to do. Overall, I enjoyed the book. It was intriguing with the story of the School, suspenseful because hiding Max could and would have come with some serious punishments from the School, and Betrayal, which I won't go into because there's some spoilers involving that. Also, I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good action book."}, {"userName": "Joseph P", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58988551-joseph-p", "userReview": "Joseph PerezRebecca Orona, MEdEnglish IV 2ASeptember 27,2016When The Wind Blows \tI am writing this book report for Ms. Orona\u2019s period 4A class. The title of the book that i have read is \u2018When The Wind Blows\u2019 by, James Patterson. \u2018When The Wind Blows\u2019 is published by Little, Brown and Company, and has has 432 pages. I read this book for multiple reasons two being, my love for science fiction and my fascination with James Patterson and his books. This novel is a New York Times #1 Best seller and sold more than 3 million copies.\tThere are three main characters of this novel. The first main character is Frannie O,Neill a young veterinarian, whose husband was part of a secret organization that performed illegal experiments on kids. The second main Character is Max, an 11 year-old girl who was experimented on by an illegal organization and escaped. The third main character is Kit Harrison, an FBI agent who is undercover and trying to break the case of the illegal experiments.\t\u2018When The Wind Blows\u2019 is a science fiction novel that takes place in the 1990s in Bear Bluff, Colorado. This book is fast paced and violent but suspenseful, which keeps you on your feet and wanting to know what happens next. The main character Max is trying to get away from her evil uncle Thomas and save her brother Matthew at the same time. Dr. Frannie O,Neill is trying to figure out how her husband David died and how it involves max, while Kit Harrison is trying to solve the murder case of her husband and figure out what is going on in Bear Bluff, Colorado and why.\tMy final thoughts on \u201cWhen The Wind Blows\u201d are that it is an extraordinary book, but I don't think I completely understood the background of certain main Characters. I really liked this book because it appealed to my senses and has everything i like in a novel in it from comedy to romance to thrillers and mysteries. I Just wish the author would have given a more detailed description of Max and her past, like how they were made and so forth. This novel taught me that family isn't always blood and that in certain situations it always good to have a wild imagination, because if something like this were to happen to you you'd think you're crazy. This is an amazing book and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction."}, {"userName": "Jordan Trimiew", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24635498-jordan-trimiew", "userReview": "I absolutely fell in love with this book!Frannie O'Neill is a small town veterinarian from Bear Bluff, Colorado. Frannie has been trying to get over the death of her husband, David. David died about a year and a half ago due to an anonymous murder. During the book, Frannie meets a man named Kit Harrison who was a former FBI agent. Ever since Frannie met Kit crazy things have been happening in her town. There have been quite a few murders that have gone unsolved. One late night, Frannie was driving home and she saw something that immediately caught her eye and it turned out to be an eleven year old girl with many outstanding features. These features seemed to be incredibly inhuman. Later on in the book Frannie and Kit get to know this eleven year old girl named \"Max\". But the more they get to know about her, the more they become in danger. Max used to live in a \"school\" with her younger brother. But they supposedly ran away due to some type of tension that grew in the school. But since Kit was a FBI agent he tries to investigate more into the school. After finding out more about the school, Kit and Frannie stumble upon very unpleasant news. Later on in the story, Frannie begins to fall in love with her life and the people in it. She feels like without them she doesn't have anything to look forward to in life. Frannie is risking everything she has to make sure she doesn't lose what she loves.Reading this book made me realize that I need to take a step back and enjoy what life brings to me because one day everything I love can possibly be gone forever. I thinks James Patterson did such an outstanding job writing this book. This book kept me hooked to the point where I finished it very quickly. The author kept me so curious I was just dying to read more. I highly recommend reading this book because it is such a great book to enjoy on your free time.This story really interested me into reading the next book in this series, \"The Lake House\". I am looking forward to see what else James Patterson has to offer in the next book."}, {"userName": "Mauricio", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12326364-mauricio", "userReview": "The following review was written when I was 12 years old:When I read this book, one of the first things I noticed was that the flow of the story seemed somewhat confusing or erratic because it is told from four different points of view. I think the author wrote the story this way to try to narrate different events happening at the same time. An example of this is when the telling of the story alternates between Max and the people who are following her. If I was writing the story, I would try to reduce the number of narrators as much as I could without negatively affecting the story's flow.I think the part where Max and her (adult) friends find the place where scientists have been making animal/human babies is very unrealistic. I think this because it is happening in the middle of a state, people and equipment probably go in frequently, and no one has noticed. In addition, one wonders where all their funding comes from. Lastly, the experiments themselves don\u2019t seem like they could happen in real life.While reading When the Wind Blows, I realized that the character I like the most is Frannie. She is funny, has a complicated life, and has to deal with as many problems as real people do. I think author really tried to make Frannie seem realistic and enjoyable. Examples of this can be found throughout the book whenever Frannie is the narrator.In closing, I think When the Wind Blows is a reasonably good book considering it\u2019s an average science-fiction thriller, and I had a good time reading it."}], "description": "Frannie O'Neill is a caring young veterinarian living in the Colorado Rockies, trying to erase the memory of her beloved husband's mysterious murder.
