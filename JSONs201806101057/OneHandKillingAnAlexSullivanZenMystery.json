Going inward, she turns around and looks around a room, activating a sense for what is unusual and central to solving the mystery of a crime. But little does she know as she wearily travels upstate to a Zen monastery where she hopes to spend ten days reviving her inner spirit that this skill will be sorely needed very soon. Will it be to strengthen her for her job or is it time to be thinking about retiring? It turns out she won't be thinking about either, for upon arrival she senses an unusual tension among the community and not from the preparations for a Buddha birthday party to be held the following weekend!Alex doesn't really get a chance to find out the problem when it is discovered that one of the monks is missing. The monastery is situated in the center of land surrounded by forest and mountains, so this monk could be anywhere. Almost before one can absorb the shock, the monk is found - dead - with a written message or Koan about a man hanging upside-down from a tree with a branch in his mouth - with a puzzle posed for the appropriate Buddhist response. Things begin to spin totally out of control with two more deaths, a cat slaughtered, and a severed hand, all of which indicate a passionate killer. Two detectives are assigned to the case initially after the first death and it takes them a while to overcome their distrust of a female detective who is out of her precinct and has no authority in upstate New York. However, she's got what they need of which she for once can't seem to make sense as there are so many potential community members and non-community members who might be the guilty party or more than one guilty party.Nancy O'Hara's got what it takes - She has crafted a terrific mystery with plenty of clues slowly revealed and with characters who exude both innocence and guilt. The calmness of the Zen Master and spiritual practices are a fascinating counterpoint to the increasing brutality and tension of the murders, with all beginning to worry about their personal safety as well as who is the killer and and how do these trained professionals, including Alex Sullivan, plan to solve the crimes before more happen? Finely done, with more captivating details, Ms. O'Hara!!!"}, {"userName": "Mack Moyer", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31262622-mack-moyer", "userReview": "I wish I could give \u201cOne Hand Killing\u201d two sets of stars. As a guy who\u2019s been into mindfulness meditation for over a decade plus quite interested in Buddhism, I\u2019d give this novel 5 stars. Alas, there are a few problems here that made me lower the score to 3. But let\u2019s talk about the good stuff first. Author Nancy O\u2019Hara has a great idea here: Putting a Zen spin on a murder mystery. Alex Sullivan, NYPD detective, is a practicing Buddhist and, as such, uses mindfulness techniques during the course of her investigations. I like this angle. I\u2019ve read about cops and other emergency personnel using mindfulness techniques to get over the inherent stress of their jobs. This novel made me wonder if there are any cops out there who use those same techniques because it helps make their job easier. I would imagine there are at least a few. After all, mindfulness meditation is catching on these days. (O\u2019Hara herself is an instructor, according to her website.) The next time a cop locks me up for public intoxication and/or lewdness, I\u2019ll ask him if he\u2019s doing so mindfully. So Detective Sullivan gets a bit burnt out and decides to head back to the Buddhist monastery in the Catskill Mountains she visits from time to time. Once there, a would-be monk gets whacked. Sullivan acts as a guide through the world of Zen Buddhism for a few local cops. Life within the monastery wasn\u2019t what all what I expected, at least in a work of fiction. Usually when a story introduces Buddhist characters, they\u2019re all emotionally blank, peaceful talking stereotypes (and sometimes magic or at least with decent karate skills). The Buddhists in O\u2019Hara\u2019s story are actually real people. They squabble. They curse. They have dirty bedrooms and sometimes they screw each other. One of them is a flamboyant gay man, which was different. It\u2019s a cool spin on your average murder mystery, definitely. Also with mindfulness becoming more prevalent in mainstream culture, I think \u201cOne Hand Killing\u201d will draw the attention of both people who meditate as well as readers who\u2019ve heard of mindfulness and Zen and want to learn more about it. You\u2019ll also enjoy \u201cOne Hand Killing\u201d if you\u2019re interested in Buddhist culture. Now for the drawbacks. This is O\u2019Hara\u2019s first foray into fiction and I could tell. The dialogue isn\u2019t great. The narrative passages are fine but O\u2019Hara\u2019s dialogue is a weak point. It can definitely be a distraction from O\u2019Hara\u2019s otherwise decent writing skills. My next gripe is a personal one. I can\u2019t stand when fictional cops do things a real cop would never do. For instance, Detective Wolfe \u2013 one of the local cops on the case \u2013 essentially orders everyone in the monastery on lockdown without so much as a court order on the grounds that, hey, you guys where here when the murder happened so now none of you can leave. I believe this is unconstitutional. In fact it seems like jack booted thuggery. These are cops, not Nazi brownshirts. Cops can totally bring in a suspect for an interrogation, but I\u2019m pretty sure keeping a bunch of people against their will is against the law. Finally, my biggest gripe came in early the story. When the murdered monk goes missing, Alex Sullivan and the rest of the Buddhists start panicking before they even know the guy\u2019s dead. It was a bit unbelievable. In all, \u201cOne Hand Killing\u201d is a cool read for people interested in meditation, Zen, and Buddhism. If you dig any of the aforementioned, you\u2019ll enjoy this novel for the most part. If you\u2019re a casual reader with no interest in any of those topics, this novel will either get you interested in them or you might tire of O\u2019Hara\u2019s not-quite-story-killing but definitely noticeable rookie mistakes."}, {"userName": "Lynda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7999442-lynda", "userReview": "Twenty-year veteran of the NYPD Homicide Detective Alex Sullivan, a Zen follower travelled to Nekoji Zen Buddhist Monastery in the Catskill Mountains for a break to de-stress and re-think her future. Immediately upon her arrival, something was off she felt it but shrugged it off. It was not long before her holidays was disrupted and her place of serenity became a crime scene - first a murder, then a butchered cat, a severed hand, suspicions and fears and more murdered monks followed. Alex along with Detectives Wolfe and Kluny investigated this puzzling mystery \u2013 who was the killer, was it an insider or not and what was the connection to the monastery? Artwork and suede-like texture on the cover was interesting. Accustomed to reading fast-paced, action-packed thrillers and mysteries, \u201cOne Hand Killing\u201d was uniquely different. To me, it was an easy-to-read story set to a leisurely pace akin to a walk through the woods, spoon-fed clues in a gentle Zen-like way. The prologue seemed hesitant, no adrenaline rush to raise the curiosity; however it was a heads-up to the style and pace of the writing to be expected. A Zen retreat enclosed with unlikely characters added an unexpected touch, steering the investigation to red herrings at times. As the lead character, Alex came across as self-centered, depressive and boring (a cry for change) until the murders sparked confidence, more energy within her and in the end she had the answers to the crimes and her life. The irony of the changes within the monastery did not go unnoticed, a serene place darkened with guns, drugs, locks and conflict. Plenty of information on Buddhism and koans were sprinkled through the pages making for interesting reading. There were a few oddities/errors that had me double backing in the story or shaking my head but overall, a good story. If you follow mediation, Buddhism or looking for a different style of mystery, this book would be for you.\u201cOne Hand Killing\u201d was received free from Goodreads First Reads."}, {"userName": "Sharon Benham", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8235558-sharon-benham", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book.All the characters are interesting as is the inside workings of a Zen monastery. It is Alex's time to take a break and where better than at her Zen monastery up in the mountains far away from all the problems in the city far below. But things turn very sinister as monks begin dying in very strange ways. It is up to Alex to figure out who the murderer is.

So my verdict is, Its worth a read, but not worth going out of your way to read"}, {"userName": "Jerry", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32798246-jerry", "userReview": "Enjoyed the book.
