Also I wrote it in and voted for it for Best Children\u2019s Book and for Best Goodreads Debut Author book for the opening round of the 2017 Goodreads Choice Awards. I don\u2019t know that it will move on to further rounds, given that so far not too many readers have read it, yet, but I hope that it does. I also hope and assume that it will eventually be widely read. To all the usual suspects, my friends that enjoy children's novels, I'm highly recommending this one!!!This book is a true gem and I believe it\u2019s destined to become a classic. It reads like a classic. I had a feeling that I\u2019d thoroughly enjoy it when I read the author\u2019s bio section on the inside back cover and it included the line \u201cone of her proudest achievements is raising two kids who can\u2019t go anywhere without a book.\u201d Love it! Also, the two quotes that act as a frontispiece before the start of the book are from the Melendy book Spiderweb for Two and from Anne of Green Gables; that was another promising sign that this book would be a winner. The story is memorable, charming, heartwarming, humorous, entertaining, absorbing, and sweet, but not too sweet. I loved the kids, the parents, and almost all the characters. Even the minor characters were given depth. The various relationships are believable and interesting. For me it was an ideal comfort read. I\u2019ve always loved books about large families so this story was my cup of tea. (As an only child I\u2019ve gotten a lot of vicarious pleasure while reading books about families with many children.) This family has 2 parents, 5 children, including a set of twins (another of my interests) and a dog, a cat, and a house bunny. It\u2019s a great sibling story. I loved all the characters. They\u2019re all distinct individuals, and the 5 kids are all a joy. I loved all of them. I felt as though I got to know everybody well within the first several pages. This is also a marvelous neighborhood story. Harlem is a character too, and an interesting one; at times the story felt like a love letter to Harlem. The story is a fine story about family, and also about friendships and neighbors/community and it has an extraordinarily good sense of place. It\u2019s a story about home, about belonging and about what makes a home a home. I appreciate that the kids have advanced vocabularies and so the book does too, but it\u2019s not at all too challenging for middle grade readers. The story has just the proper number of times some kids might have to look up a word. Kids won\u2019t mind at all, and because all the words are in context most readers will be able to figure out the meanings of unfamiliar words. For me the storytelling was perfect and the story nearly so. I\u2019m not sure that I loved the epilogue, at least not exactly as it was, but I still enjoyed it. I\u2019m perplexed about why some Goodreads members have shelved this book on their \u201cfantasy\u201d bookshelves. This book is realistic fiction.For readers who enjoy seasonal books, this book would be a fine choice to read just prior to or during the Christmas holidays. Most of the book\u2019s events take place during the few days leading up to Christmas and then on Christmas Day. This would have definitely been a favorite book of mine when I was 9 and 10, and 11 and maybe 8, and I have no doubt that I would have reread it many times. Even reading it as an adult I adore it and consider it a special book. I inhaled it and never wanted to put it down; that would have been even more true when I was in elementary school.The story is greatly enhanced by the delightful illustrations and the map of the family\u2019s neighborhood. I am fond of maps in books and this one was excellent. There is also a floor plan of the family\u2019s apartment/apartment building. I love floor plans and used to read books containing nothing but floor plans. So this illustration was great fun for me. The illustrations throughout the book were lovely and pleasing and informative and contribute a lot to the story. The cover illustration is drawn incorrectly though. Floor 2 seems to be missing. Also, the text on page 216 doesn\u2019t seem to match the map. These are incredibly minor quibbles though. I noticed the discrepancies only because I paid great attention to all the illustrations, really savoring them. I might buy this book, even though unfortunately I\u2019m not buying books these days. (I notice that it\u2019s possible to get a signed edition at a wonderful NYC independent children\u2019s bookstore I know of because I have a friend who works there. Very tempting!)Highly recommended for readers ages 9 (maybe 8) and all the way up, anyone who enjoys children\u2019s novels, family stories, NYC stories, stories with biracial characters, humorous stories, reading about characters who are musicians and/or artists and/or writers, reading about companion animals, reading about food in books, or just about everyone who enjoys children\u2019s novels. It\u2019s so hard to write reviews for books I love the most. I cannot do this book justice via my review. There is going to be a companion book coming out in 2018 and I\u2019m looking forward to reading it."}, {"userName": "Linda Williams Jackson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51019861-linda-williams-jackson", "userReview": "Have you ever had a book come along just when you needed it most? When I requested the ARC of Karina Yan Glaser\u2019s The Vanderbeekers of 141st Street, I had no idea that upon approval of the request, I would be in the midst of a very rough week and that this lovely book would be my refuge. My week was harried and anxiety-ridden, but every time I opened my Kindle to this book, I felt like I was taking a mini-vacation.I THOROUGHLY enjoyed the world of the Vanderbeekers. Karina Yan Glaser has created a charming cast of characters (even Oliver\u2026ESPECIALLY Oliver). Though it is a contemporary novel, it has a classic feel. Walkie-Talkies? Do kids today even know what those are? They will after they meet the Vanderbeekers.I highly recommend this book to parents who enjoy reading with their children. And I hope many teachers and librarians will make it available to their students. Thank you, Karina Yan Glaser, for introducing us to the WONDERFUL Vanderbeekers of 141st Street!"}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "Remember those classic middle-grade novels that hit the world in that late 50's to early 70's period?

I fell in love with the 5 Vanderbeeker children and the cast of friends, neighbors, and pets that make up their community. The Biederman is a Scrooge-like Christmas villain and the children's efforts to butter him up are hilarious disasters.

Everyone from my dad to my youngest sister enjoyed our journey through the book. And I loved it just as much the second time around. <3I loved all of the characters in this book. I never got confused about which kid was which (except for the first few chapters when I thought the dog, Franz, was one of the kids :P). They were all unique with their own goals no matter how small but similar enough to all be from the same family. Their sibling dynamics, fun traditions (like the Roof of Epic Proportions and the Christmas tree lot), and personalities reminded me very much of my own family, down to Oliver, the only brother who sleeps in a walk-in closet turned bedroom. ;) Hyacinth, the self-proclaimed middle child, was my favorite character since she was a lot like me. I also need to be brave. ;) Papa and Mama were darling, good parents, and all their neighbors were something special.I know what it\u2019s like to move at Christmastime from a home I love, so you can bet I was invested in Operation Biederman! Their attempts were hilarious and heartwarming. Some did include sneaking around their parents, but I was thrilled when this was dealt with really well. Two thumbs up and a fifth star! I loved how the story turned out, and the ending scene reminded me a lot of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life. ;)Just a note, there are some fake swear words. Also, a friend wants to take the 12-year-old daughter as his date to the school dance, but this was handled with much family involvement and was all-around appropriate. Best quote: She smiled at her siblings. \"It's good to be a Vanderbeeker, wherever we live.\"Altogether, this book had good values, a sweet story, and hilarious, true-to-life characters--a special treat for me and my family. We are eagerly awaiting the sequel. :D"}, {"userName": "Hilary", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42315986-hilary", "userReview": "I feel mean giving this book such a low rating as everyone else loves this book and my goodreads friend who recommended this to us shares many books we both absolutely love but we really didn't enjoy this at all.We liked the cover artwork although there is a floor missing on the Vanderbeeker's house and the house to the left appears to be on a different level as the top of the door dissapears into the pavement? The line drawings inside reminded me of Nick Sharrat who's illustrations I strongly dislike and I think the style lends itself to a much younger audience although I do love maps and diagrams in a book. After 90 pages my daughter wanted to stop reading, I carried on until page 200 and gave up. I read the epilogue and couldn't understand why this was about a date and not about the main plot of the book. Perhaps my expectations were too high, opening with a quote from Elizabeth Enright's Spiderweb for Two led me to make comparisons with these wonderful books and when I read parts such as the girls looking for a recipe to cook on their mums phone I couldn't help but think of the wonderful preserving scenes of Mona and Randy. The style of this book reminded me of Jacqueline Wilson an author who's books are really popular but personally I really do not like. Reading reviews for this I can see that everyone else really enjoyed this so I would recommend giving it a go!"}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6703235-ian", "userReview": "When their grouchy landlord who lives in the top floor apartment decides to not renew their lease, the Vanderbeekers face not only having to leave their beloved Harlem Brownstone they might have to leave New York.

It was a little difficult at points to keep the children straight, and I felt that the authoress would have been better off combining some of the character bits into four more rounded children, then six murkier ones. It was nice to see one of the sisters (Jessie) so interested in science. I loved her incredible creations, and it was more of a fun take on the less \"girly\" sister, instead of making her a sports enthusiast. Oliver was also nice to see; it was a relief that in a family of girls, the brother was still firmly holding onto his masculinity. :) He is a typical boy, reading boy books and getting up to rambunctious antics - but he's also quirky, and I loved his little side arc of learning not to be selfish. In all honesty though, the characters and the story weren't quiet as good as I thought they would be. All the ingredients are here to be a stupendous story, but instead of heartfelt, I felt that it could lean closer to saccharine and instead of natural, the story and characters could be a little stilted at times. I liked the setting and thought it was pretty unique for this type of story. The authoress did a great job making Harlem feel like a fantasy type location. Though I have to admit, I was shaking my head at the way the parents let the twelve year old children walk the streets of Harlem to run errand without an adult accompanying them. I don't think so. It was also interesting that unlike books such as the Penderwicks or Gone Away Lake, our character don't GO anywhere, but are committed to staying where they are. It didn't have the perfection, heart, and sticking power of The Penderwicks or Gone Away Lake - but it's still a charming better than average story and I would definitely read the upcoming sequel. Content: The children have some vocabulary that made me cringe. \"S%/ks\" - \"Sc&^/ed\" and the like."}, {"userName": "Kate Olson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13650342-kate-olson", "userReview": "The Vanderbeekers are guaranteed to steal the heart of every single reader who picks up this book, children and adults alike. This is THE feel-good and huggable middle grade novel of 2017.  Thank you to the author for providing Kid Lit Exchange with a review copy of this title. Okay, so this is one of those emotional reviews for me - one where I really don't tell you much about the book but just rave and rave and tell you how much I loved it. The Vanderbeekers instantly brought me back to reading the Melendy Quartet series as a child, books about a quirky and loving family that I read over and over and over and over, and have just recently returned to as an adult. The Vanderbeekers are just as timeless, and just as loveable. I was absolutely, 100% utterly enchanted by this book. This story is set in Harlem with an incredibly diverse cast of characters about a family who lives in an amazing home in an amazing neighborhood with a fabulous sense of community. She describes the children and their features in beautiful ways that make it clear that they all look very different from one another, and connects them to their parents' features through those descriptions. The relationships between the children and their family are realistic but also written in such a playful way - the language in this book is perfection. I love the storyline, I love the characters, I love the problems they have to solve - I just love it all. Verdict: Required purchase for all middle grade classrooms and libraries. I just pre-ordered copies for both of my libraries as well as for my own family.

This book came so highly recommended that when I couldn't find it at my library I bought a copy!! Yikes! Now I was really invested! The cover was so charming! But then I started to read, and everything went downhill. I knew where the book was headed from about p. 2, but I thought surely the author couldn't be that transparent. But she was. I sludged through the rest predicting predicting predicting. And lest you think I'm a wunderkind, I'm not. Just a normal reader who likes some twists and turns. I didn't find any of characters loveable. Christmas just kind of jumped up behind this family. The parents were nonchalant about sooooo many really important facets of their family life. New York was not believable. The landlord? How did they go that long without knowing more about him??? Ugh. I wanted to find it realistic, but I just couldn't. Perhaps if it had been written for a younger age group, it would have had more charm. But it was trying to appeal to an age group that is more intelligent and probably needs more meat in their books.

Apparently, I am. Also wasn't wild about the explanation for why Mr. Biederman was so negative. Sure, it's a cute story, but really, really worrisome!The Vanderbeekers family of five children, parents, dog and rabbit have lived on two floors in a brownstone in Harlem. The father grew up in the same neighborhood. Just before Christmas, however, their landlord, Mr. Beiderman, decides not to renew their lease, and they have to move right after Christmas. This is a problem, because the family has gotten a reduced rate because the father acts as the superintendent, and the rent on anything large enough for the family would be prohibitive. They may have to move out of the city! Hyacinth, twins Isa and Jessie, Laney and Oliver all have plans to persuade the reclusive landlord to change his mind, even circulating a petition in their neighborhood. They have lots of friends nearby-- the Castlemans, who run a bakery and have a son the age of the twins; Mr. Jeet and Miss Jessie, who live upstairs and are like grandparents; even the postman has been working in the neighborhood longer than the father has been alive and brings treats for the dog. Of course, other things are occurring while the family is trying to pack up for the move, and they plan to celebrate their last Christmas in style. Will a miracle occur so that they can stay?Strengths: This had a Melendy Family vibe, but updated for the new millenium. I love the cover, and the idea of living in the city sounds much more appealing than living there actually would be. The close knit neighborhood is wonderful, and the industriousness of the children is charming. Weaknesses: If the family had to be out of the apartment in a few days, wouldn't they have another one lined up? A mover consulted? Lots of plans made? This struck me as unrealistic; if Mr. Beiderman did rescind his nonrenewal at the last minute, it would still be problematic. This will not bother students, but it bothered me. Also, it is not helpful to portray someone who has lost family as a crazy recluse who can't move on with his life and, in fact, wants to punish others for his pain. That bothered me the most. People move on. There's really no other choice. What I really think: Since stories set in New York City gather dust on my shelves, I don't think I will purchase this."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21769118-lauren", "userReview": "This book is a delight!

And then there is The Beiderman...their landlord...who lives on the top floor and who wants them out of his building in 5 days. Oh...did I mention that it's Christmas? It's Christmas! Why I wanted to read it...I wanted to read this book for a myriad of reasons. I loved the family. I loved the drawings. I loved the neighborhood and the neighbors. I loved this townhouse that the Vanderbeekers loved so much...especially Oliver's closet and library. I could literally tell you the entire story non stop...it's just that good. It's a little book with tons of lovely reading stashed on each page. What made me truly enjoy this book...Once I started to realize that The Beiderman had a sad sad life...I could not stop reading until I found out which Vanderbeeker was going to crack him...yes...crack him like a Christmas walnut! Wait until you the reader are at this part. There will not be a dry eye in sight! Seriously...Why you should read it, too...This is a beautiful book about a biracial family and a diverse neighborhood and amazing cookies! I am craving some just by their description but I especially want the simple sugar cookie that Oliver's friend ate...oh...I do need some of Mama's cheesy bread...especially the slice with a little extra cheese on it! This is an awesome young middle grade book and an even better read aloud...it is beautiful! I loved it!Thank you Edelweiss and Amazon for my ebook!"}], "description": "The Vanderbeekers have always lived in the brownstone on 141st Street. It's practically another member of the family.
