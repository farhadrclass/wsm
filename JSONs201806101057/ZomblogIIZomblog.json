It is the second book is his Zomblog Trilogy: Zomblog II. I started reading this series a while back, and I finished it in three days. I have reviewed the first book in the trilogy, and you can read what I thought in this post: http://nicolestorey.wordpress.com/201...Brown developed a character in this book that was very different from the usual. Instead of having \u201cgood people\u201d and \u201cbad people\u201d \u2013 ones that I usually love or hate with a passion, the main character, Meredith, is someone that I admired, but also detested. After an apocalypse that pretty much destroys life as we know it, most characters in dystopian books can be seen in two \u201ccolors\u201d, if you will. They are either at the lighter end of the spectrum (good), or all the way at the darker end (bad). I\u2019ve never read a book with a \u201cgray\u201d character \u2013 someone who fit in the middle of the spectrum. That is what Meredith is, a gray character.She had some qualities that I liked: strong, independent, and not afraid to get her hands dirty. However, she was also selfish and, in my opinion, not someone that could be counted on. It is the first time that I have ever had a love/hate relationship with a character. That is just one of the many reasons that I love TW Brown\u2019s books so much. I never know what is going to happen!In this second book, Meredith takes over the blog for Sam, her boyfriend who started it in the first book. It amazes me how the author can write an entire book from one perspective and then jump into a totally different character for the second. Sam and Meredith are nothing alike, and yet, both books were written in voices that were believable.It was hard to tell from the end of the first book how Meredith\u2019s character would develop. Zomblog is written from Sam\u2019s point-of-view (for the most part), and he painted her in words of kindness with a touch of adoration, as any man in love would. Oh, how men can be fooled! He saw her as the woman he could spend the rest of his life with and she saw him as someone to have sex with. Isn\u2019t it usually the other way around?So, the burning question after reading the second book is: Will Meredith be the same person in the last book, or will she change and, like the Grinch, grow a bigger heart? The first two books in this series were excellent! Although they are zombie-literature, in many ways (and this is one of Brown\u2019s trademarks) they AREN\u2019T. After all, there is a lot more to an apocalypse than what caused it and that is where Brown hooks and reels his readers in. You really have to read his books for yourself to understand where I am coming from. But BEWARE, after the first few paragraphs, there is no turning back! LOL! You will become a member of the Brown-Groupies Fan Club with the rest of us (T-shirts are only $15, BTW)! It\u2019s tough to be one of TW\u2019s minions, but so worth it, and it has been a hell of a ride so far!"}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "Zomblog II slides the reader into the story started with Zomblog with ease, with a second character having taken up the challenge to provide a journal about the ongoing zombie apocalypse. Meredith, who actually became the narrator perhaps halfway through the first book, continues to tell of her experiences as she moves from place to place and meets new survivors along the way, while trying her best to keep those she cares about alive. I thought the way the author shifted perspectives was quite creative and surprising in the first book. I won't ruin the surprise here by giving away what happens in the second book, as I tend to prefer not to give away the overall plot. So if you are expecting the same type of shakeup here, you will have to read the book for yourself to find out what happens to the main character and if they make it through to the end. Zomblog 2 moves at the same breakneck pace as Zomblog did, but Todd Brown has upped the ante with even greater challenges and darker realities for the narrator of this tale to face as the initial days of the zombie apocalypse fade into the distance. The most compelling aspect of this book is the author's willingness to show both the absolute best and worst aspects of humanity and keeping you glued to every page as the story unfolds. Make no mistake, this is a gritty, raw tale that expects the reader to accept how depraved mankind can get when things go bad. Certainly, there are those who retain elements of their humanity, but while living in barbaric, ugly times, the bad seems to shine through, and those that are willing to do anything are the ones who tend to survive. Not that there aren't good people still around, but even those people are forced to do questionable, brutal things, including the main character. Perhaps the dark, dim nature of this tale might be too grim for some, and fair warning if you like coming out of a tale like this with a strong sense of hope. There is perhaps some, but nothing that will reaffirm your faith in mankind, that is for sure. Despite the fact that this is a diary approach to writing and there really isn't dialog because of that, we are able to get to know Meredith and some of the key characters that surround her quite well and what drives and motivates them through her words and the emotions that resonate off her journal pages. Meredith is a fleshed out, hard nosed character that keeps the story moving forward every step of the way. This book kept my interest from start to finish, and I look forward to checking out how the story continues with the next Zomblog journal entry."}, {"userName": "Alex Laybourne", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4720244-alex-laybourne", "userReview": "Zomblog II follows off nicely from the ending of Zomblog. We are reunited with Meredith and friends, and continue to share in their adventures as they journey across the country. The thing that sets this novel (and its predecessor) apart from the standard Zombie fare, is now that the zombies have arrived, they are no longer the only threat. After more than a year on the run, dodging the undead, small communities have been formed. Armored fortresses offer sanctuary to many. We visit several of these places during the book, but Meredith cannot seem to bring herself to settle. She always moves on, something leaving her friends behind, but often taking new ones with her. Where there are the roots of civilization, there are two forks that said group could take. Good and bad, and it is this horror that Todd Brown once again captures with masterful ease. While dodging the slow, lumbering undead may sound daunting, avoiding the roving bands of lunatics intent on using all women as their personal sex slaves, and crucifying anybody else that is left alive after their murderous blood train has rolled through is a completely different story. The Genesis Brotherhood are the real villain of this novel, and while there is plenty of zombie slaying action to sate even the most ardent genre readers, this second installment in the Zomblog series asks some interesting questions about humanity. There was one particular scene that chilled my blood, but I won't give it away for any clue would spoil the impact just a little. I highly recommend this novel, but you must read the first installment of the series, for it is not meant to be read as a standalone book. There are a lot of little references to the previous books, and given that the man who started the Zomblog died in book one, it is certainly beneficial to get to know him first. I cannot wait to start book III in the series."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3835702-kat", "userReview": "A few weeks ago I read the first book in this series, Zomblog, and it wasn't really my thing. I didn't connect with the main character and it was a little lacking in direction. But I decided to try the second book - the POV changes between books and I did like the new narrator, so what was there to lose?With that new POV came a new perspective (duh), but also more direction. Meredith is a tough cookie - at times almost too tough, but it's the zombie apocalypse - puppies and flowers aren't really an option. Shes ruthless, strong, stubborn and I thought she was THE perfect character for this story.And there is direction - Meredith has a goal in mind, and no one (dead or undead), is going to stop her from reaching it. As the world continues to descend into chaos, the good, the bad and the ugly human survivors emerge, and Meredith encounters the whole lot - dealing with them in her typical no-prisoners way.Zomblog II is a book that I couldn't put down - I had to find out what happened to Meredith and her friends (and enemies), and it's a great example of how writing in journal form actually can work, and work well. It's a rough, intense read, and Mr. Brown has some confronting ideas on just how far human beings will go to survive.Read more of my reviews at The Aussie Zombie"}, {"userName": "RJ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4187755-rj", "userReview": "Not a bad journal-style rendition of a group of survivors making their way to suspected safety during the zombie apocalypse. Book one started out with a male journal writer and narrator, but when he came to an unexpected end the journal was passed on to one of the females in the group, Meredith. The female narrator doesn't have the same impact as the male, but it's not bad enough to completely put me off. Much to do over Meredith having her baby. She didn't want to stay in one place raising a baby so she had planned all along to give it up to a deserving couple. She made her decision and then planned her exodus from camp. Book two continues with Meredith's journey, more survivors, and her experience with the Genesis Brotherhood. The baby, Snoe, looks to become a major player in coming novels in the series. This begins to get a bit more interesting to the point of expanding to four stars."}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "I love the way TW Brown writes... zombies are my current (and long term) love. His characters are believable as they have some dramatic and plausible faults! and it is a work of fiction (we hope!) some literary licence in how we heal, mental and physical, has to be given.It is an unusual style, with it being a diary type/1st person style but the switching between characters allows for differing points of view without forsaking the style.Meredith is my kind of girl, yes she is self centered but so she should be, altruism seems to only get you so far in the Zpoc. the heinous things that happen along the \"adventure\" that she has made me shudder and wonder at humanity in general... but TW Brown does make you think.... would we/could we be any different, I hope we are.Really looking forward to the final installment and the continuation of the DEAD series...more puppies and happy moments too tho please!! or am i getting soft!"}, {"userName": "Kay Glass", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9044026-kay-glass", "userReview": "I started reading this story last night around 11 p.m. I didn't put it down until 3 a.m. when I finished it. I kept telling myself I'd stop, and then get sucked back in. Meredith is a character you just love to hate. She's cold, ruthless, and sees losses as casualties of war- but isn't that the case anyway? You may hate her for her cold praticality, but that's life in the midst of the zombie apocalypse. Even motherhood is nothing but a hinderance, but though her decisions are cold ones, they are also the right ones- for her. She loves some of her fellow travellers- as best as she can, that is. And in her cold way she mourns their loss. I look forward to reading more from this author. Definitely worthy of 5 stars in my opinion."}, {"userName": "Selinalynn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4330920-selinalynn", "userReview": "The Journal lives on!
