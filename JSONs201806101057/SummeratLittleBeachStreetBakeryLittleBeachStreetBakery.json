Yes, everything's coming up dog poo for our protagonists... and it's just as well, really, as it wouldn't have been a very interesting book otherwise.As it is, what we end up with is that rare beast: a sequel that is actually better than its predecessor! I know; that hardly ever happens, right? Well, in this case, Jenny Colgan has not only managed to bottle the magic she captured in the first book but she's plugged it into the amp and turned it up to eleven.The peril is greater this time around, the stakes are higher and things look pretty bleak for a good portion of this book. There are a number of very moving sections and I even had tears rolling down my cheeks twice succumbed to my book allergy and had to start freebasing antihistamines.I don't want to say too much about the actual story because it could only litter the review with spoilers but I will say that at least one character from the first book dies. Oh, yes... the author's pulling no punches with this one.There's actually a fair amount of action in this book, mostly when the worst storm for 150 years hits the village, and our protagonists actually have to put on their hero boots and get stuck in.What I liked the most about these books is that every time we start heading into twee chick-lit territory with a darker section, a bit of genuine peril or even just a mouthful of foul language from one of the characters! As a result, you get chick-lit that this big, hairy, middle-aged man is entirely unashamed to say he absolutely loved. I'll certainly be reading more from Colgan in the future.P.S. Yes, the author shares more of her recipes at the back of the book again.P.P.S. Yes, Neil the Puffin is in this one too, don't fret.P.P.P.S. I did mention that one of the characters from the first book dies, right?P.P.P.P.S. I'm not saying it's Neil that dies.P.P.P.P.P.S. I'm not saying it's not either...Additional: I just found out this author also writes science fiction...

She has her dream job running her bakery, living in a lighthouse with her gorgeous American boyfriend Huckle and her cute little pet puffin Neil. Little does she know that storm clouds are brewing and once again her life is going to be turned upside down.This is a really nice, easy read and would be perfect for relaxing on the beach. There is romance, drama, intrigue and danger with a cast of characters who may not all be likeable but are certainly entertaining to read about. I did have to agree with Huckle though when he said that Reuben was annoying! He isn\u2019t a major character in this read though so I could put up with him! And, the bread! I could almost smell that heavenly freshly baked bread scent in my kitchen as I was reading. I want a Beach Street Bakery in my village now!

Polly is in love \u2013 with the beautiful seaside town she calls home, with running the bakery on Beach Street, and she\u2019s definitely in love with her boyfriend, Huckle. And yet there\u2019s something unsettling about the gentle summer breeze that\u2019s floating through town. Selina, recently widowed, hopes that moving to Mount Polbearne will ease her grief, but Polly has a secret that could destroy her friend\u2019s fragile recovery. Responsibilities that Huckle thought he\u2019d left behind are back and Polly finds it hard to cope with his increasingly long periods of absence. Polly sifts flour, kneads dough and bakes bread, but nothing can calm the storm she knows is coming: is Polly about to lose everything she loves?I was SO excited to be back in the world of Polly and her beautiful little bakery down at Beach Street! If you haven\u2019t already then please read Little Beach Street Bakery first\u2026although it doesn\u2019t get confusing if you haven\u2019t as this one can be read as a standalone, and Jenny always makes sure that you are given enough information to know what happened, reading the first one can make it more enjoyable as you get to read more books with the characters in and have a longer experience with them!Polly is a firm favourite of mine, I loved her character and her personality since the first book so it was wonderful to be reunited with her as she continued her journey and her life on Mount Polbearne. But with a turn of events and other issues popping up, I really felt for Polly as she faced all of this. I really really rooted for Polly, and I was absolutely gripped to the story wanting to know what would happen next and how Polly would cope with everything. I REALLY want to talk about all the events but I\u2019m desperate not to spoil anything, but there is lots of love, friendship, emotion, obstacles, and lots of bread too!I LOVED Polly\u2019s interactions with Huckle, I swoon over them as a couple! And who can forget that there is a gorgeous little Puffin Neil who just makes me feel happy all of the time! Jenny also does a fantastic job of incorporating brilliant and delicious recipes and food into her stories, and if you are like me then it will have you itching to get in the kitchen and start baking! Summer At Little Beach Street Bakery is a thoroughly enjoyable read and a fantastic return to Mount Polbearne!"}, {"userName": "Maria Jo\u00e3o (A Biblioteca da Jo\u00e3o)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8785143-maria-jo-o-a-biblioteca-da-jo-o", "userReview": "8,5 de 10*Jenny Colgan surpreendeu-me pela sua escrita leve e fresca no livro \u201cP\u00e3o, Mel e Amor\u201d.

It couldn't be better for her. But of course, fate strikes again and Polly loses her bakery to a horrible man and her boyfriend has to go back to where he came from once again. Also, a woman returns to Mount Polbearne, who has something to do with the misery from the previous year and Pollys feelings about everything are turned upside down. Again. Well, at first I was quite excited about that new person in town. I wanted to see how she and Polly clash with each other and I was hoping for a little bitch fight or at least a tiny row. Did I get that? No. Well, that woman owns a cat, which caused some trouble, but not the trouble I was hoping for. That was kind of disappointing, really. In the end, the big secret was unraveld, but did they fight then? No. Because it was in the middle of the big drama (literally) and they were best friends again after that. So disappointing. The story itself wasn't entirely to my liking as well. I didn't like the fact that Huckle (what a great name, but I'll come to that.) left Polly alone for stupid reasons and then didn't come back for forever for reasons that were even more stupid. With every page I disliked him more. A shame, because I quite liked him in the first part. Towards the end I got more and more annoyed with Polly and Huckle and the story itself. It also took me ages to finally finish it. Then, the end. Well the happy end was okay, but not nearly cute enough. At all. And before the final happy end, of course there had to be some total, life-threatening drama. Which had to do with the sea, just as in the first part. Okay, they live on a tiny island, so heavy storms and huge waves and whatnot are probably most likely, but still. And after that Polly is the most wonderful heroine of all time, blah, blah, blah. How could it have been any different? Now, to the names: Huckle. I could ignore the stupidity of that name in the first part, but now he has a brother called Dubose. Seriously? And what kind of cruel parents name their children Huckle AND Dubose? The brother was stupid, so his name fitted him perfectly. All in all, I would say I clearly expected more. It was just not cute enough, not lovely, not satisfying in any way, at all. There was not the fight I was hoping for, no romance, because the guy went away, no daily bakery life, because the bakery kind of went away, too. Polly gets a substitute for her loss of the bakery, but still.

I know I am for a real treat with her every new book, and I enjoy them all because they are full of warmth, human feeling and they always put a smile on my face. What should I want more? It also seems that I can't have enough of stories set on small islands or in little villages, where the sense of community is so strong developed. Mount Polbearne reminds me so much on Poldore from Rowan Coleman's stories, they are both lovely places to live and I would move there without hesitation.I am not sure if this book should be read as a stand - alone novel, I'd rather recommend you read \"Little Beach Street Bakery\" first. Yes, Jenny provides a brief catch up at the beginning, just as she usually does in her series, and I personally find it a brilliant idea, but in my opinion to fully understand Mont Polbearne, to get into the depth of the story, you should read both books. Polly is living in Mount Polbearne, in her newly purchased lighthouse, with boyfriend Huckle and Neil the Puffin, happily doing this what she loves to do: running the little town's bakery. Life is perfect, right? Unfortunately, everything goes belly up with the death of Mrs Manse and when her nephew turns up on Polly's doorstep and starts to \"rationalise\". He wants to see profits only and has pounds signs in his eyes, and soon Polly finds herself out of work that she loves so much. Money is short so Huckley decides to head back to America, to help on the farm and to earn some money. To add more troubles to this all, the widow Selina comes back to the island, Malcolm the Nephew is sabotaging Polly's new business, and after this horrible accident with the cat, Polly decides to hand Neil over to his natural environment, deeply hoping that he' going to turn out on her doorstep again, just like the last time... But is he? Can Polly come to terms with the changes in her life? With the arrivals and departures? Is Polly and Huckley's love going to survive? What with Polly's dream to have her own bakery?I had no idea how much joy the re - union with Polly and co. is going to bring me. I have easily and seamlessly picked up on the story and felt as if I have never left Mont Polbearne before. My feelings to Polly didn't change, she was as adorable as she was in the first book. Living her life happily, in a lighthouse, with Huckle and Neil, surrounded by her friends, but she never takes things for granted, and this is what I love in this girl. And all her feelings and moods were so real, and I just couldn't help but keep my fingers crossed for her!I also loved to meet up with Huckley and his no - nonsense life approach, and well, the way Polly thought of him, reminiscing when he was away, hmmm, Huckle is a new candidate to be a book - boyfriend, no? Responsible, having both feet hard on the ground and reasonable, but also able to drop everything and get on a plane, just to see with his own eyes that his girl is OK. Neil the Puffin is of course the star of the show, and he steals every scene he's in. Eep. (You know, I've already read \"Polly and the Puffin\", in fact I have hidden the book because Sophie makes me read it hundred times a day, but nevertheless, Neil is a hero. I think he's the best of all the other animal characters in the books that I've come across). I have absolutely adored the fact that Jenny focused not only on Polly and Huckle and their problems, but added more characters, characters that I've already grown to love, to the story, and so we have more of Kerensa and Reuben, and no matter what he says or does, he's just brilliant, and those two make a brilliant sex... I mean, love - couple. We have the fishermen, who still can't recover from the tragedy, but who are so lovely and loyal, and please don't give them matches in hand! Mrs Manse's nephew Malcolm and his antics, his posing for a businessman, haha, I'm laughing hard, do you hear, Malcolm? We have more of Jayden, who's Polly's right hand and tastes all her baking, and bubbling with enthusiasm he often forgets that those are things for the customers, and so often there is nothing left for them, but who's so lovely and honest. There is also Huckle's brother Dubose, the free - spirit, not the most likeable character in the world, especially when you get to know his history and Clemmie, and last but not least, Selina, the fisherman's widow, whose return on the island brings more tears and problems, but also helps to see things in different light. They were all characters living their own lives, vivid, popping out of the pages people that felt as realistic as the person next to you.As for the plot, yes, it is a little predictable, but there is nothing wrong with a little of predictability, and yet the story is full of surprises, turns and twists. The relationship between Polly and Huckle felt more serious and they were so much in love, it was a real joy to see those two together, to see how great they felt in each other company, and they were just a couple made in heaven, they were destined for each other, basta. Of course Jenny Colgan put Polly into many troubles, and it made me so sad to see Polly so sad, to see her fighting for her survival, it was her to be or not to be, to be so lonely and having to face up everything by herself. There is so much happening in the story that I didn't want to put the book down in case there was something new coming up on the next page, and there are so many questions: what is Polly going to do now when she's out of her job? Is Huckle going to come back or rather stay on the farm? And Neil? What's going to happen to him? And is Mont Polbearne without fresh bread at all possible? There is not only a lot of humour, but also a lot of drama, and of course there must have happened a storm - and how did this end this time?The descriptions of the town, the nature are beautiful. In fact the way Jenny Colgan wrote the storm just gave me the shivers, she can write in such a vivid, realistic way. She actually brings not only the characters, but also the island itself to life, and you can't help it but let her draw you into the whirl of the events, and quickly you will find yourself rooting for the characters, keeping your fingers crossed for them, cheering on them or booing them, and - shortly - just feeling as if you were a part of this book, a part of the characters' lives. Jenny Colgan has a brilliant way of writing, she makes the dialogues sound totally realistic in the mouths of the characters. She has this talent to add a word or two and thanks to this the atmosphere becomes lighter, more optimistic. Jenny doesn't exaggerate, she writes as it is but even if the siproblem seems impossible to be solved , there is something uplifting in her writing that let us think everything will be OK. There is really some kind of magic in her writing that enchants you, and her books are a wonderful breath of fresh air.It was an incredible story with a feel - good factor to it, full of sunshine and good humour. A lovely novel, full of spirit, brilliant small town inhabitants, this small - village community sense, with a great dose of dry humour, wonderful one - liners, touching moments and in the end you can't put it down, telling yourself \"just one more page, one more page\", and ending with sleepless nights because of this \"just one more page\". This book was so heart - warming and full of warmth, and I just couldn't help it, but as I think the best place to read it is in a full sun, I just wrapped myself in as many layers as possible and read it mostly on my terrace, enjoying the first rays of the spring sunshine and a cup of hot chocolate. I have absolutely adored this story and I really wouldn't say no to a third book in the series.

The first one I liked much better than this one. The premise on both were interesting but the execution failed for me on this one. The main character has a good story arc but I felt the other characters were a bit outlandish and unbelievable. The main character was British and her love interest was supposed to be American. I can understand that through spending time in the country he would pick up phrases that were local so his dialog could be British, but his thoughts would still be in his native language and there was no differentiation between the two. Other problems were innuendos and references to intercourse that were offensive to me, sometimes vulgar language, and it's very formulaic. Just like all the other books in this genre, it is about a woman who loses or quits her job and opens her own store only to encounter obstacles in her professional and romantic life. The first time it's an interesting read, but after that it is boring and I lose interest. I've tried many different authors with the same result which is why I have difficulty enjoying contemporary fiction."}, {"userName": "Luise", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23504531-luise", "userReview": "3.5 starsIn this second part, the happy end of Polly and her little bakery is threatened by the new owners.\u00a0 That 'evil counterpart' spiced the storyline up which was quite good.It didn't make up for everything else, though. It's not like there was nothing happening or something. But it kind of felt that way. There's Polly in various shades of miserable, a happy end turned unhappy, nothing cute and a bunch of new/ annoying/ not very likable/ I-don't-care-about-them people. (And good old Huckle isn't my favourite Prince Charming so far.)When that 'accident' happened to Neil, Polly turned into a very unsympathetic person. She didn't live in that flat anymore and she knew there was a cat. And the description 'really chill cat' is usually related to their behaviour towards humans. Not stupid birds.

She was thin and stooped, with a hangdog stance, and had a way of peeking up through an overlong fringe that simply looked guilty, even though there was a pretty face hiding in there somewhere.\u201d\u201c\u2018There is no point being bitter that there are wankers in the world,\u2019 said Huckle. He sounded funny saying \u2018wanker\u2019 in his thick Southern accent. \u2018If there weren\u2019t any wankers, you wouldn\u2019t know how to spot the nice people.\u2019\u201d\u201cEveryone wants to call their boss a pig\u2026 Come on, if you can\u2019t make a big fuss when you\u2019re being sacked and storm out going \u2018You\u2019re a pig!\u2019 you\u2019re not really a human being.\u201d\u201cThe sun was glinting on her hair, and he pulled her close and gently kissed the freckles on her nose, and realized, suddenly, that there was so much he wanted to say, but if he started, if he even tried to get the words out, then he would start to cry, and he wouldn\u2019t get on the train, and they would be in an even worse situation than they were in already.\u201d\u201cShe only locked it in the summer during the daytime, and that was only after she\u2019d come home once to find a family of wide-eyed holidaymakers in her sitting room, with the father extemporizing, \u2018\u2026 and then one day the lighthouse keepers simply vanished without a trace,\u2019 at which she\u2019d had to shoo them out, which had scared the children of the party, who thought she was the lighthouse ghost.\u201d\u201cIf Polly was upset or cross about something, he would listen to her, hear her out, then suggest he make them Spanish omelettes and they could curl up on the sofa and watch something with zombies in it. Most problems, when it came down to it, could pretty much be cured, or at least helped, by curling up on the sofa with an omelette, watching something with zombies in it.\u201dMy Review:I adored this delightful and charming story and did not realize it was the second in a series, and although I had no trouble following the story as it had strong legs, I would love to go back and read the first book as well as anything this author has ever written, or will write in the future. Instant fan-girl here. Ms Colgan\u2019s humor is sneaky and her characters are endearing, quirky, and beyond lovable. Polly and Huckle are completely and utterly adorable, but who could not love a woman who slaves away in a bakery while earning mere pennies, mainly for the love of feeding her friends; lives in a broken down lighthouse with a Puffin named Neil; and pays more for a cursed food van named Nancy than the seller was asking because she was worried about him? I found Polly and her cadre of friends to be a delicious and precious treat, although there was one hazard I should mention - I found I was often hungry while reading, and seemed to be yearning for large quantities of hot tea and toast."}, {"userName": "Paula Sealey", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2650544-paula-sealey", "userReview": "Polly is living an idyllic life in the Cornish town of Mount Polbearne. Happily running the little towns bakery and living in a lighthouse with her boyfriend, she feels life can not get any better. But visitors to their town bring change with them, and Polly soon finds her life taking a downturn. Can she pick herself up and save the life she so loves?A highly entertaining read, I found myself reading on well into the night to discover what would happen to the various town inhabitants. Polly herself is a likeable protagonist, and together with the hunky Huckle and adorable Neil, they made a neat family unit. Jenny's descriptions of the Cornish town are just beautiful. I really could picture myself snuggled up in the lighthouse or swinging my feet off the harbour wall.This book is a follow on to 'Little Beach Street Bakery', but works perfectly well as a stand alone read. Jenny even provides a brief catch up before the main story begins so you have an idea of how Polly came to live in the town. Like me, you'll probably want to go back and read more about Polly though, so the preceding book has been added to my 'to read' list.In summary, this is a lovely, feel good novel worthy of a place on your shelf.*Thank you to the publishers for providing a review copy through NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Robin Stevens", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22721588-robin-stevens", "userReview": "Oh, flip, I love these books.

Because Polly is in love: she's in love with the beautiful seaside town she calls home, she's in love with running the bakery on Beach Street, and she's in love with her boyfriend, Huckle.And yet there's something unsettling about the gentle summer breeze that's floating through town. Selina, recently widowed, hopes that moving to Mount Polbearne will ease her grief, but Polly has a secret that could destroy her friend's fragile recovery. Responsibilities that Huckle thought he'd left behind are back and Polly finds it hard to cope with his increasingly long periods of absence.Polly sifts flour, kneads dough and bakes bread, but nothing can calm the storm she knows is coming: is Polly about to lose everything she loves?", "title": "Summer at Little Beach Street Bakery\n      \n          (Little Beach Street Bakery #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23477296-summer-at-little-beach-street-bakery", "average": 3.88, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1414643214l/23477296.jpg", "reviews": 691, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/39272.Jenny_Colgan", "name": "Jenny Colgan"}], "type": ["Womens Fiction", "Fiction", "Romance", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23477296-summer-at-little-beach-street-bakery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23747616-summer-at-little-beach-street-bakery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35018845-tempestade-de-ver-o", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27067878-summer-at-little-beach-street-bakery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36137303-l-to-s-v-n-erstv-ho-chleba", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25927285-summer-at-little-beach-street-bakery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35003848-sommer-in-der-kleinen-b-ckerei-am-strandweg", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28372019-the-bookshop-on-the-corner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18213783-little-beach-street-bakery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10134852-meet-me-at-the-cupcake-caf", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13006132-welcome-to-rosie-hopkins-sweet-shop-of-dreams", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16079967-the-loveliest-chocolate-shop-in-paris", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
