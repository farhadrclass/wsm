Apart from any aspects of her transsexuality, she's a great writing, and although I tend to avoid memoir, I would have read about her life and memories even if she'd had a conventional sexuality. The episode of her grandmother and aunt during the hurricane, and the night Orange comes over and then the drunken vet dressed as Santa turns up at his house -- all the reviewers who didn't like the writing, are you telling me those bits didn't have you falling out of your seat laughing? (And to Erin Walior, who write \"I really didn't like the writer's style. I know she's not a writer, and that's obvious.\" Um, she is a writer. And she talks about it in the book -- did you actually read it?)As for her story, I was profoundly moved and felt my self having that old revelation that I've had countless times before, but that we all should be reminded of constantly -- everyone is just trying to live their life. Everyone is \"normal.\" Any lifestyle you can look at as \"strange\" or \"deviant\" is just a person doing the best they can to be who they are. Gay, straight, trans, illegal immigrant, everyone of our lives is just our lives. It isn't exotic, it isn't some freak-show to be stared at or even pitied, it's just life. I can't help but think a lot of people who were disappointed by this book wanted something more sensational, and were let down when it was just a woman leading her life. I really wish people who gave books three stars or said they were disappointing would let on a bit more what that means, as I can't see not loving this book. But my responses to the more common complaints:\"She's self-absorbed.\" Um, its a memoir? Anyone who writes a memoir thinks that their life, or their thoughts about their life are interesting or important enough that strangers would want to read it, which is, by definition, self-absorbed. That said, I think Jenny is very patient and understanding with her friends and partner, and goes out of her way to let their doubts, concerns, and even anger show through in a compassionate, fair manner. We see how hard it is on her wife, and not in a way that makes her look judgmental or bigoted, just a woman who is confused about why she has to lose the man she loves. I particularly loved her inclusion of the e-mails between herself and Russo, as Russo perfectly encapsulates the confusion and doubt that many friends of transitioning individuals must feel, even as he is trying his hardest to love an support Jenny. And to Wistaria Clark, who was offended by Jenny's glib comment about the director of her movie dying -- um, dark humor? She wasn't being self-absorbed there, she was being funny.\"I wanted more of an insight into the trans experience.\" There is no \"trans experience,\" there is only the individual, human experience. You can't read Wright and get the \"black experience,\" or read Wolfe and get the \"female\" experience,\" or read Dan Savage and get the \"gay experience.\" Boylan was writing about what she went through as a male-to-female trans individual -- if you want to understand \"the experience,\" read a few more memoirs. I bet each one is different. Wistaria (again) complained \"I feel like I have less of an understanding of what it is like to be transgendered. It gave me no insight into the issue. How did she know she was a woman born in a man's body? She just wakes up in the morning knowing she's a woman. Just like women do. Uh huh. So helpful.\" It might not be helpful, but its true. Can you explain to me how you knew you were a woman, and make it both interesting, meaningful, and helpful to me as a man? Probably not. Jenny's job as a writer isn't to help you understand \"what its like to be transgendered,\" its to tell her story, which she did brilliantly. I just hope that Boylan writes a follow up five years from now, as the book basically ends as her new life is beginning. Her relationship with Grace is, understandably, the most compelling and complex aspect of the book, and where the two of them go from here, and how their relationship evolves, would make a great book on its own."}, {"userName": "Diane Barnes", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7262060-diane-barnes", "userReview": "To be honest, this is not a book that I would ever have considered reading had it not been assigned for our June selection in my real person book club. The person who chose it is a psychologist who wanted some insight into the subject of transsexuals and their feelings. It is also very timely because this book club is in NC, and we all know about the \"bathroom issue\" that NC has created. I make the drive several times a year because our book club has been together for 25 years.This is the story of a woman born into a male body and her struggle for many years to overcome her feelings and fit in. As a man, she fell in love with a woman, got married and had 2 children. She was an English professor at Colby College in Maine, co-chair of the English department, an author, a part time musician, financially solvent; in short, she had a very good life.....as a man. But she had a tortured inner life, because every morning she woke up in the wrong body. Finally, in her early 40's, she admitted to her wife that she wanted to transition. This is the story of Jenny's life from childhood, through her sex change experience, and after.What really put this memoir across the top for me was the involvement of Richard Russo. He is one of my favorite novelists, and, it turns out, Jenny's best friend. Back when Jenny was Jim, they shared an office at Colby College and through their shared sense of humor, they formed a close bond. Russo had a huge part in this story, from his shock at learning Jim's secret, trying to accept it, and being there during the hormone therapy and the surgery. He wrote a 5 chapter afterward, illuminating his feelings in trying to come to grips with the whole scenario. That was one of the best parts of the book for me.I can't say that after reading the book I can understand the feelings of transsexuals any better than I did before, but I can certainly better understand the difficulties they, and their families, face. This memoir was written with great insight and humor."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1269863-christina", "userReview": "There were a few things I loved about Jennifer Finney Boylan's memoir \"She's Not There\" - mostly the insights into the differences between male and female.But when I finished, I felt like SOMETHING definitely wasn't there.I wanted more from the memoir.I wanted to know why Boylan always identified with women, even though she was born male - the deep psychological reasons. Was her father not home enough? Not loving enough? Did she have an especially close relationship with her mother? Was there some kind of traumatic experience? Or did she always feel that way?I wanted to know how she dealt with those feelings as a child. How did they manifest? How did other kids react? How did Boylan-the-little-boy cope? The memoir seems to jump from Boylan being a 4-year-old boy to a 10-year-old to an 11th grader.I wanted to know why Boylan felt she had to become a woman. Sure, she tried living as a manly man and it never felt quite right. But why couldn't she just try not hiding that aspect of her personality and living as a man with a lot of feminine traits? Why didn't she try taking drugs to help her feel more masculine when she was a man? Or did she - and maybe not tell us about it?I wanted to know about the surgery. How much did it cost? Had she been saving up for it? Or did it create a financial strain for her family? (Boylan is a college professor and her wife is a social worker. I can't imagine that they're rolling in dough.) And if it created a financial strain, how did the family cope?In that aspect - Boylan's transition and surgery - the book seemed too unreal. Her kids took it well. Her wife, while upset, took it reasonably well. There was no yelling and screaming recorded in the memoir. It seemed like money wasn't really a problem. It just seemed too easy.And how does Boylan feel now that she's a woman? Good, presumably. Is there anything she misses about being a man? Does she find it easier or harder being a woman? If she could undo it, would she? Or would she go through her transition and GRS sooner? Or would she do everything the same?And...Would it have killed Boylan to provide some lyrics to the oft-mentioned song \"She's Not There\" so that we readers could understand why it's significant??And...Why is it that Boylan's friend, Richard Russo, provides the most meaningful insight in the book in his afterword?\"She is not merely Grace, she is his grace - that gift from God that can never be earned, but must be rather freely and gratefully accepted.\"Why didn't Russo just write this book for Boylan?"}, {"userName": "Julie Ehlers", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2120450-julie-ehlers", "userReview": "I loved this book. In those first disturbing post-election days, it was very difficult for me to find a book that didn\u2019t feel either totally trivial or wrist-slittingly bleak, but She\u2019s Not There fit the bill. A significant work in the canon of trans literature, this memoir leavens its own importance with a very healthy dose of upbeat humor. And the writing is just great\u2014I hadn\u2019t realized the author was a novelist and creative writing professor, and I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting the skilled, engaging writing that\u2019s on ample display here. I learned a lot and was exceedingly grateful for Boylan\u2019s willingness to bare her soul for the benefit of all of us.

Boylan presents such a compelling and captivating exploration of what it means to be a woman through beautiful writing and a very open presenatation of her own life. It's been a long time since I read a memoir this good. The book made me think about myself, my thoughts about love, and my celebration of being female. I recommend it for everyone.I don't think that Boylan's story tries to be the catch-all transsexual story.

I myself was a bit surprised about the author's naivete when she was first transitioning--clearly, while living as a straight man, she had never met trans people or even gay or lesbian or bi people who were out. Quite a sheltered existence, considering she was a sophisticated college prof at Colby. So her story is probably more important, then, because she didn't have a supportive trans or glbt community to stand by her as she faced the challenges of coming out, transitioning, and dealing with negative reactions from family and friends. She's no Leslie Feinberg or Kate Bornstein, but her memoir has something important to say to the mainstream of American society nonetheless."}, {"userName": "Carmen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen", "userReview": "It is a memoir written by a transsexual. James Boylan is a husband and father of two. He is a published author and a college professor. But for his whole life, he felt like something was wrong \u2013 that he had been born in the wrong body. This is the tale of him slowly coming to grips with having to make a sex change. He goes through a lot of therapy. It's about how he comes out to his wife, best friend, and children, and how they dealt with it. He starts dressing like a woman, and taking hormones. It talks about his surgery. It is a well-written book, and the subject material is very interesting. You can see pictures of Boylan as a male, and later, as a female in this book. Now a woman, Jenny Boylan is still a professor at the college. At the end of the book, she is still married to Grace, her wife, but she leaves a kind of ambiguity to it. After she started changing, wearing skirts and growing breasts, her wife didn't want to have sex with her anymore. They are now more like sisters, they say. But her wife, Grace, doesn't want to break up the family. It would be interesting to know what happened after this book was published. Grace deals very well to James transitioning to Jenny. She doesn't leave, or ask for a divorce, but you can tell she's crushed. She's lost her husband, and she's lost the man she married. It's very sad. While Jenny is free, liberated, and finally happy, Grace is faced with nothing but terrible choices. A very intimate and informative portrait of transsexual life.

I really enjoyed the book, but not in the ways that I expected to. I also have to say that I think that memoirs are hard books to review, because they are about personal experiences and there's so many different things that one can take away from a memoir.I went into this book thinking that I would learn more about what it means to be transsexual and what someone who is transsexual and undergoes a sex change endures. Although I did learn about that some while reading this book, I found myself very touched by the stories of the individuals surrounding the author. I kept thinking of her spouse, namely of how difficult it would be to be in her place and how I think I would feel in that circumstance.I felt that this book was well written, although there were a few parts near the end where the way the narrative was executed was slightly awkward. Boylan had me laughing out loud many times in the first half of the book. However, she had me wanting to cry at a few points. I definitely value a book that can have both of these effects on me. I also have to say that I think the afterward by Richard Russo adds so much to the end of the book.

Though regarding mystery, this book ultimately touches on what Russo sums up in his loving afterword - mysteries \"which reside at our human center, constitute the deeper truths of our being\" whcih \"we often keep secret, because to reveal them makes us vulnerable.\" And the Mystery of \"the way our heart inclines toward this person and not that one, how one soul selects another for its company, how we recognize companion souls as we make our way through the world in awkward bodies that betray us at every turn... not the special dilemma of the transgendered person: it's in all of us.\"I enjoyed the humor and tears - recognized the defense against grief and the pain that comes from moving toward a truth to one's self that feels like a pull away from dearly held others. The story of marriage, family and friendships, broke my heart and in the process made some more room in what can sometimes be a tight little space, often closed off to people I do not understand.

The pitch for She\u2019s Not There, the hook, was transgender transformation. It begins with James Boylan\u2019s adolescence, his romantic forays, his life as a bachelor, a married man and father all the way up to the decision to physically become a woman. There are a lot of anecdotes, sarcastic comments and reflections. In the end, the book does very little to unravel the mystery of gender reassignment. In fact, I still don\u2019t understand why Jennifer Boylan thinks she\u2019s inherently female. In the beginning of the book the author states there is a difference between female and femininity. Near the end of the book she reiterates that statement. No where in the 300 pages does she explain what this means. Instead whenever James Boylan unveils his female persona, he correlates it with a skirt and a bra. Surely a preference for high heels is not a reason to believe you are female. Specific female traits that come to mind are fastidiousness, nesting, worry, sensitivity to others, fussing, mothering, heavy use of the words \u2018should\u2019 and \u2018shouldn\u2019t\u2019, particularity and multi-tasking. These aren\u2019t evident in the book. Instead, while dabbling around the topic of gender identity, the author writes about her musical gigs, her travels, her academic achievements, the pseudo famous people she meets and her wit\u2026she has to tell you she\u2019s funny. The author does admit to some traditional masculine preferences like beer swigg\u2019n and swear\u2019n but points out these are not exclusively male (I agree) and therefore don\u2019t disqualify her from being female. For me a disqualifier would be the road trip to Nova Scotia. Pitching a tent alone in the wilderness to reflect is not something women do.I didn\u2019t intend to read this book with the idea of \u2018confronting\u2019 Jennifer Boylan\u2019s decision to be female. In fact I feel quite arrogant doing so. Having never met Mrs. Boylan, I was left with a book that tries hard to be amusing instead of insightful and occasionally found myself, and shamefully so, wondering if Mrs. Boylan\u2019s decision to change sex was spurred on by a need for attention. Ridiculous, I know. The transition must have been unimaginatively hard. But then, after the fact, she didn't exactly choose a life of obscurity. I wish nothing but happiness for Jennifer Boylan. I hope she experiences profound peace with her decision.

Yet for some reason, I wrongly assumed that this book was popular because of its subject matter and not because of its incredibly engaging writing. I also assumed that since it was published in 2003, it might be somewhat outdated in its perspective on trans identity. I was misguided on both counts. Boylan is a fabulous writer, exuding the perfect combination of pathos and comedy. But what most impresses me about this memoir is her ability to explain gender dysphoria in a non-binary manner.In doing so, she helps clarify for me one of the major debates in gender studies today: on one side, the argument that someone can inherently know that their gender doesn't match their bodies, while on the other side, the argument that gender is a social construct and not something inherent or biological. Boylan expertly explores perspectives by openly sharing her own complex experience, which does not fit neatly into either box, through an attitude of question, honesty, and, ultimately, wonder.Here's one of my favorite passages:\"What I have come to realize is that no matter how much light one attempts to throw on this condition, it remains a mystery. Worse, it is a mystery that everyone has an opinion about...Having an opinion about transsexuality is like having an opinion on blindness. You can think whatever you like about it, but in the end, your friend is still blind and surely deserves to see. Whether one thinks transsexuals are heroes or lunatics will not help to bring these people solace. All we can do in the face of this enormous, infinite anguish is to have compassion\" (248).Perhaps the major triumph of this book is that it is about far more than gender -- it is ultimately a profound quest narrative, a love story, and a tale of deep and abiding friendship. From Richard Russo's afterward: \"To my mind, an even deeper mystery than the secrets we keep is the mystery of the way our hearts incline toward this person and not that one, how one soul selects another for its company, how we recognize companion souls as we make our way through the world in awkward bodies that betray us at every turn. This is not the special dilemma of the transgendered person; it's all of us\" (299).

She is a Professor of English at Colby College in Maine and transitioned (changed the gender she presented to the outside world) about ten years ago at about age 45 while at Colby. She was and still is married and has two sons that she fathered with her non-trans female partner.This book was very literally life changing for me, but it is not likely to be so for the vast majority of readers. I read it in October 2008 a few months after I began to have a major crisis in my own life related to the fact that I am also a trans woman. At first, I read this book and some other biographies of trans women looking for good ways to explain to my own wife the feelings associated with the disconnect between who you know yourself to be and who everyone around you expects you to be. It turned out that Jenny was so good at describing these feelings and her situation so similar to my own (I am also a University Professor, am about 45 years old, and until recently was married to a non-trans woman) that I found myself learning a great deal about myself as I thought about the things she said. This book took several weeks for me to read since it often gave me a lot to think about before I moved on and on some occasions I had to put it down when parts hit too close to home and caused me to break down crying.There was a now-defunct message board at Jenny's web site (www.jenniferboylan.com) that particularly drew married middled-aged professional trans women (many with children) who were close to or had recently transitioned. I have become very close friends with many of these women even though I have only met a handful of them in person. It was Jenny's writing in this book (and the subsequent book \"I'm Looking Through You\") that brought us all together and allowed us to share very similar and emotionally intense situations that would be completely alien to almost anyone outside our tiny demographics. I went to Seattle with one of these friends to see Jenny speak and to take a writing workshop from her in March.

Also, since she is a comic writer, her tone is very light, even though she speaks of sorrow, concealment and pain. Too many memoirs pour on the melodrama, which this one doesn't. We learn a lot about what leads to the decision to have sex reassignment surgery. For a man who has already had children and has a loving marriage, the decision is a difficult one, with no way of avoiding pain for the partner involved. Boylan makes the distinction between sexual orientation and gender orientation, but there are some gray areas. For instance, the reassigned person may experience a change in sexual orientation when she receives the massive dose of female hormones. Her partner may not experience a change in orientation from heterosexual to homosexual. Then things may get difficult, but Boylan and her wife seem to have remained partners and friends. She has changed names to protect the participants in this controversial story, but she gives the real names of his family on her web site. All in all, a well written memoir which helps us understand the issues that transsexuals and their friends and families face."}, {"userName": "Kylefoster85", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1809665-kylefoster85", "userReview": "This book has everything to do with how a transgendered individual goes throughout their life with such a difficult secret. Jennifer goes through her life as James because she feels like she has to, in order to keep her life and family together. As James, she felt like she could be \"cured\" of her need to be a woman by finding love. Eventually, she finds Grace, who is uniquely understanding, and raises a family. But even then, even with her successful life as a man, she needs to be a woman. The thought that she is in the wrong body never went away, and eventually she had to choose to hurt her closest supporters, which is a decision that caused her to hurt just as much. I'm glad that Jennifer did have the support she needed after making the decision to change her family life forever. I don't think I could have been brave enough to tell that secret after a long marriage. This book helped me understand that transgendered people are no different than the rest of us. Jennifer, as James, looks like any other person on the outside, but emotionally, the suppressed side causes an amazing amount of grief.I greatly enjoyed this book and cannot wait to read more about gender issues in genera."}, {"userName": "Writer's Relief", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7400591-writer-s-relief", "userReview": "With a fine balance of humorous wit and emotional depth, Jennifer shares the story of her transition from being a man (\u201cJames\u201d) to being a woman in her memoir SHE\u2019S NOT THERE. As someone who didn\u2019t know much about the transition process, I was fascinated. After spending 43 years as a man, married, with two children, \u201cJames\u201d decides to risk everything to become Jennifer, the person she felt she was always meant to be. It\u2019s encouraging to see the support \u201cJames\u201d receives when she finally reveals her innermost secret to her family and friends, including noted author Richard Russo. It\u2019s also intriguing to watch the family dynamic that unfolds between her wife and children, and her new identity.I had a few questions after I finished reading the memoir and actually reached out to Jennifer. To my delight, she responded and referenced her next book, I\u2019M LOOKING THROUGH YOU, which delves futher into her life with her family.This book will leave you with a greater understanding of transgender people and the difficulties they experience. And Jennifer tells her story in such a universal, nonjudgmental way, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve just had a heart-to-heart chat with a new best friend."}, {"userName": "Sharon Rosenberg-Scholl", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6446530-sharon-rosenberg-scholl", "userReview": "\"Having an opinion about transsexuality is about as useful as having an opinion on blindness. You can think whatever you like about it, but in the end, your friend is still blind and surely deserves to see.\"This was a captivating book, as evidenced by the fact that I had every intention of going to bed an hour ago, but found myself unable to do so until I reached the end. With poignancy and great humor, Boylan tells her story of growing up Transgender and finding her way to allowing herself to live as the gender she always knew herself to be. That she was a writer who happened to be Transgender, rather than a Transgender person who decided to write a book, is a gift to us all.

A college English professor writes about his decision, in his 40's to transition to the female he has felt himself to be since childhood. Fascinating to read about how his wife and sons handled the change. Equally fascinating to realize that a person could go through something so traumatic and painful and emerge on 'the other side' with sense of humor intact. The author freely admits he had been a 'golden boy' all his life -- I wonder how common it is for a person to make such a change, not lose his/her job, and find family and friends generally supportive and encouraging. The author sounds like a delightful person and it would be interesting to hear how life has turned out since."}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1147841-jackie", "userReview": "What a wonderful and startlingly honest book this is! The world is not an easy place for the transgendered, especially during transition: jobs are lost, relationships strained or broken, even strangers can be cruel. All because someone wants to be physically what they are emotionally, psychologically and spiritually. Finney takes you through every painful step of the process--and shows you some of eventual joys. This book is about love and self respect above all else, being true to yourself no matter what the world has to say about it at the time.

I read this book in a straight session only stopping to eat and sleep. What appealed to me about Jim/Jenny\u2019s experience is the optimism throughout the story: that he/she is convinced that all will be well with enough effort, good will and a lot of love and respect for one another \u2013 and this is exactly what happens: there is a happy ending and a fulfilled life. I acknowledge that transgender biographies often reflect the sad attitude of society and bear witness to ugly and cruel treatments of the trans community: social rejection, violence, unemployment, destitution etc. This is why I found that a biography lacking heart-breaking trauma is a great lesson and testimony for all of us who struggle with the hurt caused by those we loved for many years as males in our lives \u2013 as fathers, sons, husbands, lovers, friends \u2013 as they announce that they are changing to females. It is hard to grasp that someone we thought we knew as a male had secretly harboured for many years the need to be a female to feel happy and fulfilled. It is also not easy to accept that they equally suffered from being in the wrong body and in consequence suffer guilt, deception, loss, grief as they change identity and during their transition from male to female. Jim/Jenny admires the \u201csaintly\u201d effort and courage of his wife Grace and is grateful to all (friends, children, colleagues etc) who stand by him/her. In the end it is clear that those who rejected Jim/Jenny\u2019s gender reassignment are simply ignorant: they fail to grasp that love for one another transcends gender identity. This book is a wonderful feel-good read, written in a witty and entertaining prose.

She\u2019s Not There is the story of a person changing genders, the story of a person bearing and finally revealing a complex secret; above all, it is a love story.By turns funny and deeply moving, Jennifer Finney Boylan explores the remarkable territory that lies between men and women, examines changing friendships, and rejoices in the redeeming power of family. She\u2019s Not There is a portrait of a loving marriage\u2014the love of James for his wife, Grace, and, against all odds, the enduring love of Grace for the woman who becomes her \"sister,\" Jenny.To this extraordinary true story, Boylan brings the humorous, fresh voice that won her accolades as one of the best comic novelists of her generation. With her distinctive and winning perspective, She\u2019s Not There explores the dramatic outward changes and unexpected results of life as a woman: Jenny fights the urge to eat salad, while James consumed plates of ribs; gone is the stability of \"one damn mood, all the damn time.\"While Boylan\u2019s own secret was unusual, to say the least, she captures the universal sense of feeling uncomfortable, out of sorts with the world, and misunderstood by her peers. Jenny is supported on her journey by her best friend, novelist Richard Russo, who goes from begging his friend to \"Be a man\" (in every sense of the word) to accepting her as an attractive, buoyant woman. \"The most unexpected thing,\" Russo writes in his Afterword to the book, \"is in how Jenny\u2019s story we recognize our shared humanity.\"As James evolves into Jennifer in scenes that are by turns tender, startling, and witty, a marvelously human perspective emerges on issues of love, sex, and the fascinating relationship between our physical and our intuitive selves. Through the clear eyes of a truly remarkable woman, She\u2019s Not There provides a new window on the often confounding process of accepting ourselves.", "title": "She's Not There: A Life in Two Genders", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54935.She_s_Not_There", "average": 3.91, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386923381l/54935.jpg", "reviews": 746, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/30973.Jennifer_Finney_Boylan", "name": "Jennifer Finney Boylan"}], "type": ["Autobiography", "Nonfiction", "Lgbt", "Gender", "Glbt"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54935.She_s_Not_There", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15841867-she-s-not-there", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18891889-she-s-not-there", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1038316.I_m_Looking_Through_You", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31214015-long-black-veil", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15799171-stuck-in-the-middle-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7251081-falcon-quinn-and-the-black-mirror", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9513660-falcon-quinn-and-the-crimson-vapor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205082-everything-is-horrible-and-wonderful", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
