The former MI6 officer has suffered rejection by the establishment and personal tragedy along the way, but he\u2019s not quite given up on tracking down a Russian agent he knows to be the cause of much of his recent misery. Then he\u2019s contacted by a source who spotted the Russian at a holiday resort \u2013 could this prove to be Kell\u2019s opportunity for revenge?I find Cummings to be less convoluted than LeCarre \u2013 a good thing \u2013 but this book also reminded me that although his stories are well crafted and have much of the intrigue you\u2019d expect from a spy thriller, he can be\u2026 well, a little dull. Kell isn\u2019t the most engaging of characters and his various associates are a pretty bland crew too. There is some fun here in being walked through the various tradecraft elements of the spy-game, but there\u2019s nothing particularly new or startling here. The Russian is an interesting character and the tale does spark to life whenever he\u2019s on the scene, but I\u2019m not sure this is enough to enliven a pretty routine plot line. The whole thing washed over me and left a barely discernable aftertaste. There\u2019s nothing offensive about it and there are some good scenes, but it\u2019s pretty average fare."}, {"userName": "Simon McDonald", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8280170-simon-mcdonald", "userReview": "Relentlessly fascinating, taut, atmospheric and immersive \u2014 get out your thesaurus and start looking for new superlatives. Charles Cumming\u2019s A Divided Spy deserves them all. Quite simply, spy thrillers don\u2019t get much better than this.While I hate revealing my ignorance, I must admit I was not familiar with the work of Charles Cumming prior to grabbing a copy of A Divided Spy from the shelf. I was looking for a page-turner, having just invested several hours in a book that was taking me nowhere but an unpleasant abyss, and the quotes accompanying the blurb seemed to promise as much. And for once, the blurb undervalued what was delivered: one of the best spy thrillers I\u2019ve read in years.A Divided Spy is the third book in Cumming\u2019s Thomas Kell series, and while new readers mightn\u2019t appreciate the depths of some of the relationships, and be privy to the entirety of their backstory, the novel can be read as a standalone. And if you\u2019re anything like me, it\u2019ll only entice you to immediately add the preceding novels to your reading stack!Kell is a former MI6 officer, but after a lifetime of dedication to Queen and Country, and an operation that went particularly bad, he\u2019s retired from the service. His days are now perfunctory, fueled by a desire for revenge against the Kremlin who took the life of a woman he loved. When Kell is offered a chance at vengeance, he takes it, and embarks on a mission to recruit a top Russian spy and turn him against his superiors \u2014 but with the Russian holding key information about a devastating terrorist attack on British soil, Kell must decide what\u2019s most important to him: personal retribution or protecting innocent lives. And can he live with the consequence of either decision?A Divided Spy is a literate, exhilarating page-turner. It\u2019s not a wham-bam actioner in the style of Robert Ludlum, whose best work loosed bursts of violence on readers every second chapter, but that said, those who read thrillers purely for the gunplay won\u2019t be disappointed by the novel\u2019s conclusion. Indeed, Cumming\u2019s sparse use of shootouts is precisely what makes the book stand out: it doesn\u2019t need blockbuster action moments to propel the story forward, and keep you entranced. And that\u2019s a surefire sign of a great thriller.As things stand, A Divided Spy is my forerunner for spy thriller of the year, and it will take something truly spectacular to best it."}, {"userName": "Zoe", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18237582-zoe", "userReview": "Well written, entertaining, and twisty.

Le Carre writes in the same genre but is celebrated as the author of several novels regarded as among the best ever written. I\u2019m usually suspicious of such analogies. But this one is apt. Cumming\u2019s protagonist Thomas Kell brings to mind the jaded George Smiley of le Carre\u2019s early spy novels. Both constantly wrestle with moral questions and frequently reflect that the difference between MI6 and its Russian counterparts is fuzzy at best. And both are deeply skeptical of the importance or effectiveness of their efforts. As Kell reflects in A Divided Spy, \u201cIn his twenty-year career in the secret world, Kell\u2014in common with many of his colleagues\u2014had developed a theory that most of the Service\u2019s greatest successes had come about, in part, because of cock-up and human error. He had never been a believer in perfect plans and immaculate conspiracies.\u201dCumming describes his protagonist as a man with \u201ca facility for deceit and manipulation [that] was as much a part of Kell\u2019s character as his decency and capacity for love.\u201d And Kell\u2019s Russian counterpart notes that \u201c[t]he constant process of lying, of subterfuge, of concealment and second-guess, is exhausting. It is bad for the soul.\u201dIn A Divided Spy, Kell at age 46 has left MI6 after a bruising run-in with the bureaucrats who made his life miserable. He is brooding over the murder of his lover, Rachel Wallinger, at the hands of a Russian spy named Alexander Minasian. When Minasian unexpectedly surfaces, Kell resolves to avenge her death. He plans an elaborate entrapment scheme to \u201cturn\u201d Minasian. This plan brings Kell into conflict with Amelia Levene, an old friend who is the Director General of MI6.Meanwhile, a high-profile terrorist plot is unfolding. A young British man who has fought for ISIS in Syria has reentered England on a false passport and is establishing his new identity in the seaside resort of Brighton. Though it may seem unlikely, these two plotlines are destined to intersect. As they do, Kell is tested in ways he has never before been required to face.Like le Carre, Cumming grounds his tales in the realities of spycraft. Just as CIA officers were said to devour the George Smiley novels, I imagine that operatives for both the CIA and MI6 are reading the saga of Thomas Kell. Or perhaps they should be.A Divided Spy is the third book in Charles Cumming\u2019s compelling series of espionage novels featuring MI6 officer Thomas Kell.

When I read descriptions of books #1-2 it would seem Kell started off beleaguered, called \"a disgraced spy.\" The events of this book start with a man who is struggling and ends with what seems to me to be a genuinely final decision to leave the service. Who knows? Maybe that's his \"shtick\" - getting dragged back into the spy business unwillingly. He is not respected and then he is. Unlike any spy book I have read previously.

He would have the opportunity to recruit a Russian intelligence officer who had been instrumental in getting someone killed that Kell had feelings for. Or was it the opportunity for revenge he could not resist? The meeting and transactions result in a story fraught with tension over the basic question of who to trust.

The trouble with page turners is that there can be too much action to be realistic, but I think that problem has been avoided here. The spate of jihadi outrages in Europe following on from the horror of 9/11 adds to the credibility of threat of the disillusioned character who is part of this story.The ways in which people on the same side tell lies and part-truths to each other and enemies mix truth and lies to each other all ring true, as do the details of spooky tradecraft.Congratulations to this author who has clearly not stinted on his research and who is a master of his chosen genre."}, {"userName": "Mark Sohn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57598339-mark-sohn", "userReview": "This novel wraps up some unresolved business from the previous Thomas Kell books and does so nicely.

Having read two of his novels, I can understand why. Cumming's stories are credible and convincing, and in Thomas Kell he has created a likeable and interesting spook. 'A Divided Spy' is a rattling good read with a gripping plot which, despite its many twists and turns, is not difficult to follow. Kell is a disenchanted former MI6 spy. His disillusionment set in when he lost the love of his life, Rachel Wallinger, on an MI6 operation some 12 months or so ago. She was assassinated by the Russian foreign intelligence service (SVR) in Istanbul. Since Rachel's demise, Kell has been living quietly in London and grieving over her death. He has no plans to return to espionage. But then an unexpected opportunity for revenge presents itself. He is informed by one of his ex-colleagues, Harold Mowbray, who now works privately, that Alexander Minasian, the Russian agent responsible for Rachel's murder, has a secret gay lover. Kell seizes on this information as an opening for retribution. And so begins a beguiling, cat and mouse battle of wits between Minasian and Kell. Matters become more complicated when Minasian informs Kell that he has knowledge of a terrorist attack that ISIS is planning to unleash imminently in the UK. Written in a simple, no-frills style, 'A Divided Spy' is a very entertaining novel with believable characters and an intriguing plot. Its page-turning prose will have you gobbling up the pages avidly. There is plenty of apparently credible information about the way in which MI6 operates. Cumming also provides a fascinating and very convincing insight into the motivations of some young Islamist terrorists. 'A Divided Spy' is well worth a few hours of your time. 8/10."}, {"userName": "Charles Finch", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8152701-charles-finch", "userReview": "From my USA Today review*John Updike once observed that contemporary spy fiction has never stopped yearning for the Cold War.

Kell \u2013 grizzled, trying to smoke less \u2013 tracks a closeted Russian agent through his lover, and from there trips onto a homegrown British jihadist. It\u2019s a smart, nuanced, readable tale, reminiscent of Olen Steinhauer or Robert Littell.

It can be read as a standalone, but it helps to have consumed the first 2.The story begins when Kell, still adrift since his previous adventures, is alerted to the presence at a resort of the Russian spy who was involved in the death of one of his previous close acquaintances. He proceeds to develop a plan to 'turn' the agent and somehow gain revenge for his prior actions. Of course, not being formally in the British spy community presents problems, as does Kell's previous relationship to the female head of MI6. In the meantime, a terrorist is planning an attack in an English seaside town. The fun, and intrigue, thus proceeds..... The writing isn't as crisp, nor is the dialogue, the character development is pretty non-existent (the hard work with that was done in the first 2 in the series), and Kell's actions seem pretty naive throughout, but the plot is decent and the conclusion is well-done. There's a lot of introspection by the Kell character but not enough solid logic used in his decisions, for my taste anyway. Like the others in the series, the tradecraft descriptions seemed solid.

Another excellent novel by Charles Cumming; the 3rd in the Thomas Kell series. His most recent novel is relevant to what is happening today. It involves an ISIS terrorist operating in Britain and an old adversary in Russian intelligence. The power play between Kell and the Russian agent is particularly interesting although the main action involves the jihadist. The Russian agent is what you expect from an intelligence agent: patriotic, clinical, crafty and unemotional; Kell by contrast, has a moral compass and is often uncomfortable with intelligence work and its casualties. His reputation and career swings this way and that way. Is he really made of the right stuff ? You will find out towards the end of this novel.

The first novel dealt with French versus British spycraft squabbling with sometimes lethal outcomes. His second novel dealt with an old school, Cold War based piece searching for Rogue agents who may be giving those red bastards the inside track.Each of the novel's informs the next one in terms of character development, or in this case lack of character development. With our lead character showing the emotional maturity of a high school student. While he is supposedly and arch spy, who for some reason is constantly working on his own dime. So I suppose he a volunteer spy.The first two novels were sort of fun, leaning towards simplistic plot with pedantic asides between main characters regarding Britain's place in current Global affairs. But, I enjoyed the Spy versus spy stuff that was a throwback to John le Carre kind of stuff.This one approaches how old regine's deal with the new challenges of terrorism in the post-cold war, post 9/11 universe. Also fine. But our lead hero is at once the most important person in MI6 and also the least valued Sad Sack spy.Thomas Kell has no secret power to speak of except being vaguely literate, self-indulgent, and self-pitying. There is a constant allusion to how he does not get technology, yet it is full of 70s technology throughout.So our lead character is fighting the bad guys perpetually on his own, while also courting the beautiful, but insincere head of spy world.The fact that he needs to buy a car and to get a gun for his chosen Hobby. Is so irritating. Even when he gets a car it's always an Uber or a cab. When he gets a gun he doesn't seem to know what to do with it. I suppose this makes him an antihero. But after three of these books you think he would learn how to do anything besides Ponder what a crummy career choice British intelligence was.The novels, all three, show a character who does not develop or change. Which is fine, except he is written as though he is the thinking man's spook. So while I enjoy the old school spycraft stuff, I have wearied of this character and the, periodic, out of place, political orations tossed into dialogue.In short, I weary of the French enemy, the Communist enemy, and the terrorist enemy, as seen through the distracted and weak perspective of this mediocre lead character."}, {"userName": "John McKenna", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7390748-john-mckenna", "userReview": "A Divided SpyMysterious Book Report No. 289by John Dwaine McKennaFor some arcane reason . . . known only to themselves and the cosmos . . . the Brits are the masters of the spy novel universe.

In a private effort to get revenge on the Russian he thinks is responsible for her death, the sets up the Russian to be trapped into working for MI6. His trap works, but Kell finds that he likes the Russian more than expected and comes to realize he was not the one responsible for his girl friend\u2019s death. He learns through the Russian of a terrorist plot that is about to play out in the UK. He tries to warn MI6 of it, but they are not taking the word of the Russian seriously.

I have a new author to follow."}, {"userName": "Steve Easter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16394500-steve-easter", "userReview": "I enjoy novels about espionage, and picked this one up on a whim at Barnes and Noble in Burlington, VT. This story was particularly engaging because it explores the angst and ennui of a working spy who is very good at what he does: managing and turning agents working for foreign powers, and at the same time detesting the never-ending deceit and manipulation of his own employers and colleagues. The central figure, Thomas Kell, works for British SIS. At the beginning of the story he has recently lost his girlfriend who was deliberately killed. Was it to punish him for an effective operation against a Russian agent? Did the Russian SVR have her killed? Were his own bosses complicit in it? The self-doubts and utter loneliness of the spy are powerful tools in this author's hands. And can he find friendship, or at least deep respect, for a sworn enemy agent whi is also very good at his work? There is an opening quotation from Michel de Montaigne: \"We are, I know not how, somewhat double in ourselves, so that what we believe we disbelieve, and cannot rid ourselves of what we condemn.\" When is the cost to his own well-being from living with all the deception and lies too high to let his soul breathe? Well-written."}, {"userName": "Kuv Patel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45665421-kuv-patel", "userReview": "Third in the Thomas Kell series, and perhaps the author's best book, sees Thomas Kell attempting to recruit a high level Russian spy who he holds responsible for the murder of his girlfriend. Filled with grief, and a burning anger towards the Kremlin and everyone involved in the killing, he tracks the down his nemesis. Kell confronts the man named Minasian face to face, in need of information of an imminent terrorist attack, however he is the same man who killed his girlfriend. This is where the skill of the author makes the story intriguing. The relationship that develops between Kell and Minasian is mesmerizing. They are equally matched in terms of intellect. Who is playing who? The paranoia on both sides of the relationship pulls the reader into an atmospheric world of two troubled spymasters coming to terms with the lives they live. It is this conflict between the two central characters and their uneasy relationship, their clever exchanges, and deep conversations, that makes this novel intriguing and engaging. This is a great book worth reading again if only to revisit the conversations between Kell and Minasian."}, {"userName": "Bent Hansen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26421090-bent-hansen", "userReview": "I have read a couple of Charles Cumming's other books before this one, but none of the first two books in the Thomas Kell series. There are plenty of references to things in Kell's past, but Cumming did a fair job of easing new readers into things.Thomas Kell is not a super hero without flaws which makes the plot a lot more interesting than stories with spies who know everything about weapons, the next move of their brilliant adversary etc.It took me some time to get into this book - about 100 pages or so - but then I was hooked. Two seemingly completely separate subplots are slowly vowen into one and then apart again, which shows Cumming's brilliance in the genre. The slow start costs the fifth star, but Cumming writes brilliant spy novels that all fans of the genre will be entertained by - I know that I was.[An ARC of the book was generously provided by the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review]"}], "description": "Thomas Kell thought he was done with spying.
