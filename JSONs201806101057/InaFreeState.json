But during my illness I always consoled myself with the fantasy of driving through a cold and rainy night, driving endless miles, until I came to a cottage and right at the top of a hill. There would be a fire there and it would be warm and I would be perfectly safe.\u201d Rain outside and fire inside that is always romantic!In this book, story gears ahead with the revving of an engine when a burst of blue smoke and squeal of tyres are heard and then at some places skidding and slithering of the story come to a halt when the back of car slaps a mound of earth. Actually, it is about two expatriates, Bobby and Linda, driving across a nameless African country. The plot is set in Africa during the time when many of its countries were decolonized.This book can be picked up for two explicit reasons. First, it won\u2019t take much of your time. This is quite small in size. Second, it's a Booker award winner book of Nobel Laureate V. S. Naipaul. Naipaul said somewhere that this book was conceived and written during the period of intense personal depression that lasted two or three years. And it was his last such period afterward he was to know serenity. This book was probably one among his great works but I can understand how that eternal period of serenity gave us some very fine and even better works of literature later.This book depicts the chaos and frequent violence in a newly decolonized country; showing how young expatriates were attracted to these countries in search of expanded moral and sexual freedoms.It also shows how the English effect was persisting there even after their departure. \u201cThe Africans drank shorter, prettier drinks with cocktail sticks and wore English-made Daks suits. Their hair was parted low on the left and piled up on the right, in the style known to city African as the English style.\u201d What I liked about this book is the precise writing style of Naipaul and the way in which multiple themes can be explored reading this book especially through the events and conversations during the car trip of Bobby and Linda. First, they found liberation and freedom of desire in this land but later at the time of tribal conflict and rage they were forced to take a long drive to the safety!I will recommend it to them who have not yet read anything of Naipaul. A good book to start with!"}, {"userName": "Alejandro Teruel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5625189-alejandro-teruel", "userReview": "I must confess that I do not not enjoy reading V.S. Naipaul. I find his fiction overly pessimistic and bitter, his characters unappealing, passive victims whose lives seem exercises in futility. In a sense, like Joseph Conrad, he explores the backwaters of colonialism (or post-colonialism in Naipual\u00b4s case), but whereas most of Conrad\u00b4s main characters have a spark of courage, or decency or some positive human value, Naipaul\u00b4s alienated and displaced characters find it difficult to even sustain petty or mediocre aspirations.In spite of my personal dislikes, V.S. Naipaul must be considered an important writer because of his deftness in portraying the loneliness, the unsatisfied, and perhaps unsatisfiable, yearning for belonging of the expatriate, the emigrant, the deracin\u00e9, whose roots never quite take hold again, who cannot even romanticize his loss of place in the world and who never shakes off his prejudices.In these writings, freedom is thrust upon characters and countries, it is unwelcome, a burden and, ultimately, a charade. Freedom is a state of temporary suspension at the tip of a wave about to come crashing down to leave only flotsam and debris in its wake.In hindsight it can be argued that the novel which gives the book its title is a study for Naipaul\u00b4s more accomplished 1989 novel, A Bend in the River, even though the point of view shifts from one work to another.Tell me who to kill featuring two West Indian inmigrants in the UK, explores pent-up, smouldering rage and resentment as well as the frustration of well-intentioned but ultimately unreal expectations pinned on a son or a brother to escape the trap of poverty and exploitation. It is about what it feels like to be driven to scrabble to overcome an unsurmountable wall. As the narrator puts it: \u201cWe all come out of the same pot, but some people move ahead and some people get left behind. Some people get left behind so far they don\u00b4t know and they stop caring.\u201d The tragedy for the narrator is that \u201cI know I miss out. I know how much I lose when I have to stop school [...] I feel I see things so much better than the rest of my family; they always tell me I am very touchy. But I feel I become like the head of a family. I get the ambition and the shame for all of them. The ambition is like shame, andthe shame is like a secret, and it is always hurting. Even now, when it is all over, it can start hurting again.\u201dOne out of many is perhaps the best piece of writing in the book and has been deservedly anthologized many times. On a surface level it is about the culture shock that befalls an Indian servant who accompanies his master to Washington, runs away, becomes an illegal alien, discovers an unwelcome and very lonely freedom he doesn\u00b4t know what to do with. In this case, the sense of freedom as illusion, is prefigured by a startling intuition about the nature of luck: \u201cI saw then that the victory I had had was not something I had worked for, but luck; and that luck was only fate\u00b4s cheating, giving an illusion of power.\u201d On a deeper level it is about what freedom and choice means for those who have freedom thrust upon them, who did not work for it or even attempt to understand their own prejudices and thus for those whom it catches unprepared to exercise it. Naipaul\u00b4s pessimistic conclusion is that, in this case, freedom is an illusion, and that the only freedom that can be exercised is the freedom to pick the wave in whose wake to drift along.The first journal entry simply sets the stage and the pointless, cruel game at its heart reads like something out of Beckett. The only Englishman is an old tramp, bereft of all imperial trappings, incomprehensible in his pretenses to the rest of the motley set of middle eastern, mediterranean and american passengers and uncomprehending of the lives of others, he simply becomes the butt of a joke to fill in time.The final journal entry provides is a fine story in itself, with its sense of the the impermanence and empty vanities of different, and ultimately meaningless, empires set amongst the tourist-riddled ruins of Luxor: \u201cSo many empires had come here. Not far from where we were was the colossus on whose shin the Emperor Hadrian had caused to be carved verses in praise of himself, to conmemorate his visit. On the other bank, not far from the Winter Palace, was a stone with a rougher Roman inscription marking the southern limit of the Empire, defining an area of retreat. Now another, more remote empire [China] was announcing itself. A medal, a postcard; and all that was asked in return was anger and a sense of injustice.\u201d The narrator harks back to the arts of Ancient Egypt and wonders: \u201cPerhaps that vision of the land, in which the Nile was only water, a blue-green chevron, had always been a fabrication, a cause for yearning, something for the tomb\u201d and the story ends in a fit of gloom as the narrator looks forwards to Egypt\u00b4s defeat in the Sinai: \u201cSeventeen months later these men, or men like them, were to know total defeat in the desert; and news photographs taken from helicopters flying down low were to show them lost, trying to walk back home, casting long shadows on the sand.\u201d"}, {"userName": "randy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/959233-randy", "userReview": "Facts are facts: Naipaul's prose is extraordinarily exquisite. I caught myself thinking a few times while reading this that reading this is better than being high.That is some amazing power of prose right there.Before I picked this up (on the merit of it being a big influence on Kiran Desai's Inheritance of Loss) I knew next to nothing about Naipaul aside that he was considered a great writer. Now, he is on my must read list & went out and got my second book from him today.But this novel is a set of three stories of three different immigrant experiences. And each is hard to read in their own ways. The first involves a domestic from India traveling to Washington DC and his hesitancy with freedom. It was by far my favorite of the three. His sense of displacement thundered off the page and at times it was hard to breathe as you read his words of self imposed isolation and servitude that he wore like the condemned would wear a noose. His emotions are palpable and echo off the page. This was a great damn story and some of the best writing that I have ever read.The second story was lackluster in comparison to the first. But it was in no way bad. It was actually hard to read, with some words seeming more than a bit out of place, but with an unreliable narrator who has had the only the most rudimentary of educations, this is totally appropriate.The third and major story was all sorts of horrifying. It deals with two British Expats in a nameless state in Africa. And neither are what you would call of redeeming characters. They both think of themselves as caring people that are worlds better than their colonizing forefathers. On the course of their two day car ride back to their gated colony they prove just how awful they are. How they view the natives as savages or worse. They even seem to take joy in berating them, subjecting them to the most awful tasks. They never look upon the natives as equals, yet time after time reject any responsibility for the way things are.This sounds awful. And it is. But Naipaul writes it so well that you are compelled to read it, cringing at the horror of their lives. This is nasty fiction at its best. And should be required reading for anyone who is thinking about visiting, let alone living in a foreign land. Just to help ensure that this disturbing behavior molts from our collective consciousnesses. Having been living in foreign lands now for the last year, I am afraid the lessons within are not taking.This is confronting fiction. This is great fiction. This is why we read."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul", "userReview": "There are three novellas with a very short piece at the beginning and end. The focus is on being in a foreign/strange land. The longest novella deals with Africa at the end of empire; two white colonials travelling across an African state (possibly Uganda) at a time of change. It highlights their fears, prejudices and feelings about the future. There is a strong sense of threat (real or imagined; you decide) as they travel and a sense of something ending. The story about an Indian in Wshington DC and his adjustment to a new culture and a foreign land is moving. Tell Me Who To Kill with its brooding sense of alienation is also very good.I know Naipaul is not really in vogue at the moment, but I enjoyed this."}, {"userName": "Zanna", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna", "userReview": "I probably ought to re-read this as I don't think I had enough knowledge to understand it at the time I first read. I only remember the first story, One Out of Many which has made an indelible impression on me. Naipaul is masterful in telling the incisive tale of servitude transported, giving each character due measure of inherent decency, self-interest and flawed humanity. The uncomfortable meeting of worlds is all the more resonant because stories from the point of view of servants are so unusual. Over and over I was confronted with my own privilege and prejudice, and forced to think again. As a story of emancipation and readjustment, it's entirely without utopian illusions. The happy ending hits such a grim note to me it's almost unbearable. I guess I just have a very different world-view to Naipaul"}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7452125-jamie", "userReview": "I think this is one that will stay with me for a long time.I tried to write an actual review, but I'm struggling to put how I feel afterwards into words. I would, however, recommend this to absolutely anybody. There is wisdom and compassion and rage and a sense of lucid detachment that make the book very difficult reading, but make you think very deeply and clearly.I think great literature should transport you to a time and place and you should come away having lived an experience, and in this you get five."}, {"userName": "Stacia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3917029-stacia", "userReview": "Naipaul is an exquisite writer. This collection of stories addresses states of freedom -- from the intimacy within one's own mind all the way to the vastness of a country's political upheaval, along with various states in between. A malaise surrounds the narratives, all relating to displaced protagonists, wandering, not at home anywhere, I think; I say that because there's a certain disconnectedness roving through the hearts & souls of these words, something that works to keep all of the characters as outsiders from themselves & others &, yet, still human. Is anyone ever really in a free state? Recommended."}, {"userName": "Lady Jane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6472547-lady-jane", "userReview": "This is one of Naipaul\u2019s most successful works. It is an eclectic compilation of narratives written in the minimalist style that is characteristic of Anglophone literature. The minimalism of its style, however, does not make it any less deep. The tales in this book are based on the lives of characters who are somehow pitifully depicted as slaves to their socioeconomic conditions, which is a sad and common reality to the human experience, and now it can be related to the many people who are alleged victims of globalization. There is a tone of irony throughout the narratives that seem to indicate that goodness does not come to the individual as a set of consequences for having worked hard enough, but rather that good and bad are haphazard and simply a consequence of their circumstances. For, despite these people\u2019s struggles, it all seems to be in vain. This is a painful truth of the human condition, and this is true across all cultures, across all time periods, and by all ethnicities. For this reason, perhaps, the book is so compelling and transcendent that it was a deserving winner of the Booker Price Award in 1971. The title \"In A Free State\" sounds sarcastic and hiding a tinge of irony, because based on the outcomes of the characters, they never attained the holy grail of freedom that they sought and on which they based their hard work. These are all stories of vanquished dreams and frustrated realities. This, and the fact that they are all foreign Anglophone people, is the dominating theme that connects all the short stories into one miniature anthology of stories. In the first narrative, though the narrator attained his dream of moving to Washington, if was not exactly in the manner that he idealized; he was forced to marry somebody who is not his type just to obtain the citizenship he so desperately coveted. Verily, it would have been better for him to live in a third world country with the person he loves, than in the free United States with somebody he disdains. Such is the extent to which many lost souls are willing to go for money and freedom, and such \u201cfreedom\u201d is simply not worth the trouble. In the second narrative, the narrator overworks himself for his cousin\u2019s sake, only to end up totally being taken advantage of in the end. Despite moralizing claims that selflessness gains divinity, in this case it was a foolish move that gained him only the keys to Hades\u2026 but sadly, not to his freedom from the prison cell. In the third and main narrative, the narrator resolves nothing and seems to experience nothing but violence around him. In A Free State is a most depressing set of stories with no deus ex machina to save any of the characters from their painfully unfair d\u00e9nouement. Elements of naturalism and realism reign throughout these stories, and as appropriate to the style, there is never a happy ending to make the initial troubles worth it. One of Naipaul\u2019s most interesting features is that instead of hypocritically blaming the Third World\u2019s problems on the First World while living luxuriously in the latter\u2014as many complaining Anglophone writers tend to do\u2014he gives a bona fide account of the true state of affairs in the financially disadvantaged countries. Naipaul is no slave to society\u2019s expectations nor does he hide his culture\u2019s flaws out of fraternal allegiance. It is this quality which makes him more credible as a writer; sadly, however, it is also this which makes many demonize him."}, {"userName": "\u0641\u0647\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0647\u062f", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5008212", "userReview": "\u0641\u064a \u0628\u0644\u0627\u062f \u062d\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0627\u0642\u0631\u0623 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0646\u0627\u064a\u0628\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0635\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0648\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062f\u0627\u0628 \u0633\u0646\u0629 2001 \u0645\u060c \u0648\u0631\u063a\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0647 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u062d\u0635\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0648\u0643\u0631 \u0633\u0646\u0629 1971 \u0645\u060c \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0647\u0648\u0646\u064a \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0627\u064b\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0628\u0642\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0642\u0635\u0629 \u0637\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0648\u0623\u0631\u0628\u0639 \u0642\u0635\u0635 \u0642\u0635\u064a\u0631\u0629\u060c \u062a\u0646\u062a\u0638\u0645\u0647\u0627 \u0643\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639\u0627\u062a\u060c \u062a\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0648\u062d \u0645\u0627 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0628\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0646\u0641. \u0641\u0641\u064a \u0625\u062d\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u0635 \u0646\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0639 \u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0645 \u0647\u0646\u062f\u064a\u060c \u064a\u0630\u0647\u0628 \u0645\u0639 \u0633\u064a\u062f\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0627\u060c \u062d\u064a\u062b \u0646\u0631\u0635\u062f \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643\u060c \u0648\u0647\u0631\u0648\u0628\u0647 \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0637\u0639\u0645\u060c \u0648\u0641\u064a \u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u0642\u0635\u0629 \u0623\u062e \u0647\u0646\u062f\u064a \u0648\u0643\u0641\u0627\u062d\u0647 \u0644\u062a\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0645 \u0623\u062e\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0635\u063a\u0631\u060c \u0648\u0641\u064a \u062b\u0627\u0644\u062b\u0629 \u0646\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0639 \u0631\u062d\u0644\u0629 \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0645 \u0628\u0647 \u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0623\u0629 \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0637\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0623\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0642\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0636\u0637\u0631\u0628\u0629. \u0623\u062f\u0628 \u0646\u0627\u064a\u0628\u0648\u0644 \u064a\u0641\u062a\u062d \u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641\u0629\u060c \u0639\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0646\u0648\u062f \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0647\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0644\u0646\u0627\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0623\u062f\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0633\u0647\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0645\u062a\u0639\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0641."}, {"userName": "Hugh", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32318315-hugh", "userReview": "I don't know whether the sections that were excised from this new version would have helped or changed my opinion, but I found this difficult book to warm to, and it didn't leave me wanting to read more.

four smaller, seemingly disjointed narratives, In A Free State is a brisk, enjoyable read. Naipaul's writing is haunting and one can acutely feel the loneliness, meaninglessness, despair, and the feeling of being lost in a world intimately shaped by colonialism via his characters."}, {"userName": "Courtney H.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4276947-courtney-h", "userReview": "In A Free State is a collection of two short stories and a novella, with two even shorter stories bookending them. Though each story takes place on a different continent (North America, Europe, and Africa) and have vastly different facts, they are tied together by themes of displacement and dependency; each tells the stories of the relationships that are formed and which sustain and ruin the characters in their immigrated-to homes, during eras that were as filled with upheavals as were the individual lives of the characters. Of the three main stories, the second was the hardest to read but in the end was the one that stuck with me the most. Looking back (my memory is fading, which is too bad, because the stories are subtle and carefully detailed, which is how he accomplishes so much with such subdued narrative voices), all three stories are remarkably devoid of drive on the part of the main characters. They do not quest after happiness, though they can remember times of happiness (maybe particularly true of the first two stories), and it is interesting to go on journeys with all three main characters, and realizing that these journeys have such detached, disinterested drivers; the destination is merely a destination, not a goal.The first main story is about a servant who emigrants to the United States with his boss, a wealthy diplomat. It is neither a story of roads-are-paved-with-gold triumph nor of I-was-sold-a-bill-of-goods despair; it is far too subtle for either, and ascribes too obvious a drive to the narrator. The second main story is powerful, scattered, and it takes the whole of the story to piece together the chronology and how the past triggered the present telling. This is vague, but I don't want to give away too much more than that. Briefly, it tells of two brothers going to England, one -- the younger and purportedly the family's rising star -- to study, and the elder who followed to take care of his sibling. Again, I'll keep it brief because the unraveling of the story is what is most powerful. The third main story, the novella, was expertly written but in the end, the least interesting. This was the most obviously a journey story (though the second story was told while the narrator journeyed), literally and figuratively. It is about two foreigners who do not particularly like one another, driving inward from the capital of a post-independence African country on the brink of coup and civil war. After two stories of sympathetic characters, you are in the habit, by the time you reach this story, of sympathizing with the characters; which makes it all the more jarring to align your thoughts with how unsympathetic they are. They are clearly fully aware of the disastrous wave about to roll over the country and they attempt to ride ahead of it; yet their thoughts are largely turned inward onto themselves as if they sought purposeful ignorance of everything else. I guess the same can be said for the protagonists of the earlier stories, but as their plights were more sympathetic their self-absorption (if it can be called that) is more understandable. Here it becomes absurd -- purposefully by Naipaul -- given the violence that surrounds them.The bookend stories are really just snippets, of what I thought must be a single narrator, traveling. You cannot help but wonder if these stories are reflections of some scenes that Naipaul himself watched with distaste on his own ferry journeys. The writing is sharp, but they really are scenes rather than stories. I've done a lot of describing and not a lot of reviewing, possibly because even upon further reflection I still don't know how I feel about this book. It is an unforgiving book (apparently the Booker judges like those), one that does not seem to make much of an impact to begin with, but which resurfaces for further reflection over time. In some ways, the topics seemed a little stereotypical, not for Naipaul, but for the kind of book that the Bookers might favor at the time. But then, perhaps it is the kind of theme that needed attention; and given how much I still think of that second story, still does. This still isn't a review. I guess I'll just have to leave off with a recommendation to read it, and apologies."}, {"userName": "Avital", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/141720-avital", "userReview": "Somewhat numbing. I liked two stories, one about an Indian servant who leaves India with his employer. The other about an Indian who wants to give his brother better opportunities, and leaves India after him. Everybody fails miserably or feels he does.I wished both stories went on-I could read a whole novel about each. They are about foreignness, loneliness, prejudice, as are the other two lesser stories (well, more of testimonies of brutality) and as is the novella.The novella is disturbing in a way that may be unintentional. This story is set in East Africa, in Uganda, and it takes place during a revolution when the president's men are chasing after the king (the colonialist support) in order to kill him. The main characters, Bobby and Linda drive from the capital to the compound, and it's their story as well as England's colonialists' and the colony's.Every bit of movement, word and thought (especially Bobby's) are analyzed and become significant, sometimes against my intuition/logic. Bobby is a homosexual who exploits African boys, but feels as an integral part of Africa. Linda's depressed, prejudiced, angry and looking for liberation in extra-marital sex.I don't think I like any character, either leading or minor, in the whole novella. Did he mean it that way? And there are so many descriptions of the land, it becomes tiring. What Conrad does beautifully, here almost put me to sleep-there was too much of it.

Since I had essentially forgotten the previous book, I was halfway expecting a misanthropic asshole expounding on how everybody, colonizer or colonized, gets what they deserved.That isn't what I got when I read the book. Some of that might be in these fictions, but there is also a lot of empathy and thought. Maybe that is one reason he got the big ol' Nobel. Mainly these stories are either about the colonized visiting the colonizer or the colonizer visiting the colony - after the empires have left. The long one \"In A Free State\" is the centerpiece and is a shocking \"Heart of Darkness\" (Naipaul makes sure you get it by mentioning Conrad several times) tale on the white man losing his privileged point of view. The title is ambiguous and ironic - the man had carried his \"free state\" along with him as a white man, the \"you can't touch me\" attitude. Well, guess what dude, in a newly free country, they can."}, {"userName": "Ben Batchelder", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13229843-ben-batchelder", "userReview": "This is a bleak book from a very good author. I first started reading Naipaul while hitching around the world in the 1980's, especially when in the Middle East and India. \u201cIn a Free State\u201d covers slightly less exotic territory. A low-caste Indian skips his mat-in-the-closet existence with his master in a DC apartment, gets a cooking job, marries for a green card, and finds little contentment. A West Indian brother falls into criminal insanity in plush England. An English odd-couple on a long drive through the deteriorating country-side security of an unnamed African nation don\u2019t have a chance of avoiding an oppressive and eventually violent alienation.Naipaul bookends these fictions with (modified) journal entries from a boat trip to, and a tour within, Egypt, in which he captures episodic human cruelty; the first he views dispassionately, the second he intervenes with, after noting his own (writing?) hand trembling. An exile himself in his adopted England, he implies that while displacement is part of the human condition, it is second nature for a writer."}, {"userName": "Geraldine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7071653-geraldine", "userReview": "The first 2 stories were quite readable, but the third one entitled \"In a Free State\" was a real chore to read.

Naipaul creates five scenes that explore aspects of this quandary, three from the immigrants\u2019 perspectives and two from the tourist\u2019s, taken from his journal of trips to Egypt. Especially the tone of the immigrants\u2019 stories varies, from the first that is a comedy of metaphysical errors, to the second where the stress of dissimilarity and discordance results in madness to the third that explores alienation and terror in a country experiencing civil war. The two tourist\u2019s scenes show the safe detachment that most transients take from the conflicts and lives of the natives, until in the final scene Naipaul is shamed by other tourists\u2019 insensitive behavior and interposes to stop the exploitation. The initial journal excerpt recounts a two-day crossing on a passenger boat (\u201covercrowded like a refugee ship,\u201d 7) between Piraeus, Greece, and Alexandria, Egypt. The ship is filled with a motley crowd: Egyptian Greeks, expelled after British colonizers had left, returning to visit; American students dazed by their European experiences; Lebanese businessmen full of get-rich schemes; and a tramp, who seemed at first to be an English \u201cromantic wanderer of an earlier generation\u201d perhaps with \u201cthe beginnings of a novel\u201d (8) in his rucksack, though on closer observation \u201call his clothes were in ruins...an old man, with a tremulous face and wet blue eyes\u201d (8). Seeking out the only person who\u2019ll listen to him, he recounts his adventures traveling around the world, working at various jobs, for thirty-eight years. \u201cI think of myself as a citizen of the world\u201d (9) he proclaims as he recounts exhaustive details of his travels, \u201cwith sometimes a simple opinion drawn from another life,\u201d but his speech is \u201cmechanical, without conviction (9)...Over the years he had developed this way of swiftly explaining himself to himself, reducing his life to names and numbers. When the names and numbers had been recited he had no more to say...The tramp knew he was odd\u201d (10). Many on this ship are uneasy, feeling out of place and discriminated against; they attempt to compensate by engaging in activities that seem to indicate friendliness and camaraderie while masking their latent fear. One Lebanese furniture maker working in Egypt bemoans the desire for modern furniture, for he prefers to make Louis Seize, but since the foreigners have left his business has collapsed. The tramp appears, seats himself as if he too belongs, but doesn\u2019t converse with anyone. Later the narrator sees him with a small tattered book that he seems to be praying from, \u201cHow fragile that face was, worked over by distress; how frail that neck (11)...He looked close to tears. It was strange. He looked for company but needed solitude; he looked for attention, and at the same time wanted not to be noticed\u2026.I didn\u2019t disturb him. I feared to be involved\u201d (12). The Arab and German portion of passengers mingled together, the Americans kept to themselves, and into this mix the tramp came as if on a small stage. He read from his small pocket diary, tried to make some conversation, then abruptly began to tear apart a magazine. After a while he folded the remnants and \u201cwent out of the room, looking like a man who had been made very angry\u201d (13). The next morning the irate furniture maker exclaims about the bad behavior of the tramp who had the fourth bunk in their cabin. \u201cThe old guy\u2019s like a child\u201d (14), and he\u2019s even more irritated when the tramp appears for breakfast as if nothing is wrong and takes \u201cpure pleasure at food\u201d (14). That prompts the Lebanese to plot with young Hans, their Austrian third bunk mate, to stage a kind of tiger-hunt, laying out the bait of his own rucksack, and everyone looking on to see what happens. When the tramp finds his rucksack, the others surround him, the furniture maker \u201cworking himself into a frenzy\u201d (16). He attempts to seize the old man\u2019s head, misses and falls, calling out to Hans to grab him; Hans seizes him and throws him down, where he sits grasping his sack and crying, \u201cIt\u2019s not true. These remarks they\u2019ve been making\u201d (16). When the furniture maker calls out \u201cHans\u201d again, the tramp grabs his sack and runs. Later he reappears, and again \u201cHans\u201d rings out, and the tramp flees. Calling out \u201cHans\u201d even when the tramp isn\u2019t around becomes a joke, that finally isn\u2019t even funny anymore. By now the tramp is frightened and has locked himself in his cabin, threatening to set it on fire, forcing the furniture maker to sleep elsewhere. When the ship docks, the refugees emerge from the lower deck to meet the immigration officials, pushing and shoving toward them, showing \u201cthe deference of the persecuted to authority\u201d (19). The tramp appears, with \u201cno nervousness in his movements but his eyes were quick with fear\u201d (20). However, Hans and the others no longer have any interest in him, \u201cthey saw him and then didn\u2019t see him...Their passion was over\u201d (20). Naipaul the tourist gets a brief glimpse into the life of an eternal immigrant, a so-called \u201ccitizen of the world\u201d who actually belongs no place, without history that has any meaning, without future that offers any satisfaction, endlessly living in an insecure present without friends or safety. He is both pathetic and irritating because he doesn\u2019t fit in and awakens in those, who think their lives are more secure, an existential dread of what might happen. The reason for his dispossession is unclear, but so too is the fate of every person. The first story is the comic narrative of a Bombay body servant who comes with his master to Washington, D.C., thinking it will be better than returning in disgrace to walk barefoot in his hill village. Naipaul\u2019s skill with dialect immediately creates the unique voice of this servant, simple in his needs and unaware that the larger world is not as integrated as his life has been. \u201cI was so happy in Bombay. I was respected...I worked for an important man...I also had my friends...Some of us...were domestics who lived in the street. The others were people who came to that bit of pavement to sleep. Respectable people; we didn\u2019t encourage riff-raff\u201d (21). He\u2019s more than happy with a cupboard below the staircase for his personal use, and even exults that he can use the apartment\u2019s toilet rather than have to find a spot outdoors. Naipaul paints a pleasant picture of a life where Santosh could walk by the Arabian Sea, feel the sea spray and enjoy the sunrise, followed by a cup of hot sweet tea and a cigarette, enjoy life\u2019s simple, physical pleasures that follow the patterns of generations. But fate has decreed that the importance of his employer also \u201cdestroyed the pattern of my life\u201d (22). His master is being sent to America to represent his country, and Santosh worries who will take care of him; however, finally it is agreed to pay for Santosh\u2019s transportation and accommodation, but not expenses. His Indian friend warns him that no one in Washington will hold his hand and walk with him beside the ocean, but Santosh proudly thinks his friend is just \u201cjealous.\u201d Happily Santosh packs his few \u201cbelongings in lengths of old cotton\u201d (23), which he is required to take onto the plane and spreads out on the empty back seats. As he settles in he notices how different his clothes are from those of the other passengers\u2014there is nobody like himself; when he chews betel nut to relax, he is reprimanded; when he selects a drink, he picks champagne, which he can\u2019t afford and doesn\u2019t like. Soon he is violently ill, and the whole plane is disturbed by what happens in the toilet. After this nightmare comes the trauma of immigration and then his first sight of Washington, where the \u201cwild race\u201d of hubshi roam freely, and life exists inside rooms dominated by hissing air-conditioners. Although his accommodations are much better than in Bombay, he feels like a prisoner, and worst of all his master has become insecure, class conscious and worries that Santosh\u2019s behavior will be assumed to be that of all Indians; Santosh consoles him by saying, \u201cthey can just look at me and see I am dirt\u201d (28). Constantly reminding Santosh that people are \u201cmalicious\u201d and unfriendly, his employer gives him his expenses, which amount to less than $8 and tells him to go out and enjoy himself. Soon Santosh sees hippies, dressed like people from his own country, dancing and reciting \u201cSanskrit words in praise of Lord Krishna\u201d (30), but they seem half-caste, like a \u201clost people,\u201d and have bad Sanskrit pronunciation. He feels distaste for them, as when something that looks familiar \u201cturns out not to be, turns out to be degraded, like a deformed man, or like a leper, who from a distance looks whole\u201d (30). A quick drink and movie ticket cost him \u201cnine days pay,\u201d and he soon wishes to go back to Bombay.But as a prisoner in an unreal American apartment, he accepts his fate and tries to decipher America via the lives displayed on TV commercials and what he sees in his neighborhood. On TV Americans are constantly cleaning, but his hubshi neighborhood is run-down, with people in rags, and sometimes drunk in the morning. However, people are attracted to his smell, emanating from the peasant weed he brought from Bombay and later is able to sell for considerable profit. A large-sized hubshi maid for another apartment is similarly drawn and also seems \u201cattracted by my smallness and strangeness\u201d (34). Overwhelmed by her smells, he frolics with her, despite his cultural training \u201cthat it is indecent and wrong for a man of our blood to embrace the hubshi woman. To be dishonored in this life, to be born a cat or a monkey or a hubshi in the next!\u201d (35). Thus begins his separation from his cultural heritage, because now he starts to see himself as attractive, and he becomes obsessed, \u201clike an illness\u201d (35). He\u2019s uncertain about returning to Bombay, and \u201cno longer knew what I wanted to do\u201d (35). Out of vanity he buys a green suit, which he immediately recognizes as a mistake, \u201cI felt I was asking to be destroyed\u201d (36), and he reflects on his earlier comment that he was \u201cdirt,\u201d which was just a courtesy to his master, but also meant that Santosh was connected with others in a tight cultural fabric. Now he sees his master \u201cas an outsider might see him\u201d (37) and notices his unique physical characteristics, just as he has studied his own in the mirror. He recognizes that his master is now perceiving Americans\u2019 remarks as personal insults and is concerned that Americans will think he is the same as Santosh, \u201cthey think that because we are a poor country we are all the same\u201d (38). As the master asserts his separateness, he destroys his relationship with Santosh. Having nothing to lose, Santosh gives in to a sexual encounter with the hubshi maid, whom he sees \u201cas Kali, goddess of death and destruction, coal-black with a red tongue and white eyeballs and many powerful arms\u201d (38). Even doing penance doesn\u2019t calm him, especially when his master doesn\u2019t \u201cfind merit\u201d in it, and then unexpectedly a riot breaks out, \u201cthe hubshi have gone wild...They are burning down Washington\u201d (40), which fits in with Santosh\u2019s own wish to be \u201cdestroyed and consumed. I wanted escape to be impossible; I wanted the very idea of escape to become absurd\u201d (40). With no desire to return to Bombay, feeling disconnected from his master, Santosh takes regular walks and meets Priya, an Indian restauranteur. Priya\u2019s comic complaints about the trials of his business appeal to Santosh; here is a person making an existence in this new world. This seems almost like the life of people back in Bombay, and when he offers Santosh a job as cook and shows him his room with toilet, they both joke about the difference between Indian and American staff quarters, \u201cThis is how they make us dance over here...For some seconds we sat silently, I fearful, he gloomy, meditating on the ways of this new world\u201d (44). He was \u201cable to cope with Washington. I admired this strength \u2026 as much as the richness of his talk...I liked having to play with his words in my mind. I liked the mystery of the man. The mystery came from his stolidity. I knew where I was with him...to be with Priya was to feel safe\u201d (45). Yet, this too has its problems. Santosh is now \u201cearning his freedom\u201d (46), but having left his employer he is illegal and subject to deportation. Burdened by what he has done, and trying to hide from himself, he looks for \u201cbigger causes for being sad...and the effect of this was that my sadness became like a sickness of the soul. It was worse than being in the apartment, because now the responsibility was mine and mine alone. I had decided to be free, to act for myself...In the early days of my escape I had thought I was in charge of myself\u2026 [Now] I saw the future as a hole into which I was dropping...His [Priya\u2019s] talk ensnared me and gave me the bigger causes that steadily weakened me\u201d (47). As his cultural underpinnings dissolve, he begins to think of himself as subservient to Priya and calls him \u201csahib.\u201d \u201cI was a free man; I had lost my freedom\u201d (49). When an old Bombay associate of his master comes to the restaurant, he gives Santosh a generous tip, \u201can act of graciousness, part of the sweetness of the old days. Once it would have meant so much to me. Now it meant so little\u201d (50), for Santosh is no longer the person he was in Bombay, nor is he now the equal of Priya. So it\u2019s not surprising that when he overhears Priya brag that he\u2019s paying Santosh $100 a week as salary, then lies to Santosh that it was only $75, Santosh doesn\u2019t hesitate to barter his \u201csahib\u201d back to the level he overheard. Trust has vanished to be replaced by lies and exploitation in a world depleted of values, beauty and mystery.This brief victory distracts him from the realization that \u201cgaining my freedom, I had begun to accept death not as the end but as the goal\u201d (51). Lurking below are still his worries, and \u201cthe victory I had had was not something I had worked for, but luck; and that luck was only fate\u2019s cheating, giving an illusion of power\u201d (52). However, that illusion fed his courage, and \u201cI decided to act, to challenge fate\u201d (52). Now the dancing hippies seemed \u201cso much part of the waste and futility that was our world. There was no longer a mystery\u201d (52). A parcel with his green suit is delivered quietly to the restaurant, and Santosh realizes, \u201cI hadn\u2019t escaped; I had never been free. I had been abandoned. I was like nothing; I had made myself nothing. And I couldn\u2019t turn back\u201d (53). Determined now to leave Priya, he finally reveals his personal worries, which Priya seems already to have known. \u201cI told him about the hubshi woman. I was hoping for some rebuke. A rebuke would have meant that he was concerned for my honor, that I could lean on him, that rescue was possible\u201d (54). Instead Priya tells him bluntly to marry the hubshi, become a citizen and be free. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I was expecting. He was asking me to be alone forever...This is your home\u2026 You have to do what is best for you here. You are alone here\u201d and no one worries about whom you marry. \u201cNobody cares what you do\u201d(54). Thinking back over the moments of his life, he can\u2019t find the particular one that resulted in this situation, \u201cevery moment seemed important. An endless chain of action\u201d (55). Later in his room, separated from his Indian culture, his new American life seems unreal; lacking other options, he finally asks the hubshi woman to marry him. Priya is pleased by his decision, and \u201cI was pleased that he was pleased\u201d (57). Thereafter his life consists of three separate worlds: the restaurant, the parks and green streets of Washington, and \u201cthe dark house in which I live\u201d in a hubshi neighborhood. \u201cMy strength in this house is that I am a stranger. I have closed my mind and heart to the English language...I do not want to understand or learn any more\u201d (57). Thinking back to his several lives, he no longer wants to add another. \u201cI was once part of the flow, never thinking of myself as a presence. Then I looked in the mirror and decided to be free. All that my freedom has brought me is the knowledge that I have a face and have a body, that I must feed this body and clothe this body for a certain number of years. Then it will be over\u201d (58).What seems like a comic narrative ends with a metaphysical consideration that freedom, considered as purely individual actions without significant relevance to other people, where there is no concern and no value system to reward or penalize choices, becomes purely self-awareness which will be extinguished by death. The life of Santosh in India lacked this individuation, and people\u2019s functions were seen in conjunction with and necessary to the lives of others. When Santosh finally transitions to American cultural values by marriage, he still cannot quite break free from his need for Indian culture, so he decides to close himself off, as he cannot live comfortably in either culture. Because Naipaul\u2019s perspective in this story is completely that of Santosh, there is no clarification of what this truncated life means, aside from what Santosh understands. He has become a cripple, and his life will be compartmentalized, with the restaurant giving him some support and contact with ex-pats, the walks in the parks faintly reminiscent of Indian nature, and his home a place where he lives with people his culture scorns, although in America no one cares. If one thinks this is prejudice that should be overcome, the main point is that a person like Santosh is completely a product of Indian culture, which is almost the antithesis of American culture. He has no education or knowledge of the world, and for the Indian life he was destined to live that would be sufficient. But immigrating to a new country requires bridging cultural divides, which is perilous, as the other stories also show. For people without intellectual skills and wider experience, dependent upon instincts and feelings shaped by their native culture, crossing over requires almost complete abandonment of the values and ideas they have previously accepted, and a complete reshaping of their identity. The next story, \u201cTell Me Who to Kill,\u201d focuses precisely on the destructive aspects for the individual who tries to make this shift more completely. The narrator is an Indian man from the Caribbean, who from the first words in the story seems confused, helpless and irrational. The narrative jumps around in such a fashion that the reader is as confused as the protagonist, trying to figure out who Frank is and why he is accompanying the narrator on a train trip to his brother\u2019s wedding in a distant city. Little by little we discover the tragedy of this man\u2019s life and hopes, destroyed not only by the white world he tried to move into but also by the pettiness and selfishness of his own culture.At the beginning of the story his worlds have coalesced, with the rain in England reminding him of rain back home, with his suit that is now smelly coming \u201cfrom the time of money\u201d (59), with glimpses into the homes he will never enter \u201clike a big wet rubbish dump. And my heart drop and my stomach feel small\u201d (59). The mysterious Frank is a \u201ctall, thin, balding\u201d white man who is happy to be traveling with him, a good, somewhat proud man, who is his friend. Yet the narrator feels resentment toward neat, middle-class Frank, \u201che don\u2019t mean it, but he always make me feel sad and he always make me feel small, because I know I could never be as nice and neat as Frank, and I could never be so wise and happy. But I know, oh God I know, I lose everybody else, and"}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7776356-kate", "userReview": "\u0412

employer went to bed at once, completely exhausted, poor fellow. I looked around for my room. I couldn't find it and gave up. Aching for the Bombay ways, I spread my bedding in the carpeted corridor just outside our apartment door. The corridor was long: doors, doors. The illuminated ceiling was decorated with stars of different sizes; the colours were grey and blue and gold. Below that imitation sky I felt like a prisoner.\"- \"When the elevator stopped and the blue metal door slid open I saw plain concrete corridors and blank walls. The noise of machinery was very loud. I knew I was in the basement and the main floor was not far above me. I no longer wanted to try; I gave up ideas of the open air. I thought I would just go back up to the apartment. But I hadn't noted the number and didn't even know what floor we were on. My courage flowed out of me. I sat on the floor of the elevator and felt the tears come to my eyes.\"- \"I bathed and bathed afterwards. The smell would not leave me. I fancied that the woman's oil was still on that poor part of my poor body. It occurred to me to rub it down with half a lemon. Penance and cleansing; but it didn't hurt as much as I expected, and I extended the penance by rolling about naked on the floor of the bathroom and the sitting-room and howling. At last the tears came, real tears, and I was comforted.\"- \"The year turned. The snow came and melted. I was more afraid than ever of going out. The sickness was bigger than all the causes. I saw the future as a hole into which I was dropping. Sometimes at night when I awakened my body would burn and I would feel the hot perspiration break all over.\"- \"I had used the wrong word. Once I had used the word a hundred times a day. But then I had considered myself a small part of my employer's presence, and the word was not servile; it was more like a name, like a reassuring sound, part of my employer's dignity and therefore part of mine. But Priya's dignity could never be mine; that was not our relationship. Priya I had always called Priya; it was his wish, the American way, man to man. With Priya the word was servile. And he responded to the word. He did as I asked; he drove me back to the restaurant. I never called him by his name again. I was good-looking; I had lost my looks. I was a free man; I had lost my freedom.\"- \"We all come out of the same pot, but some people move ahead and some people get left behind. some people get left behind so far they don't know and they stop caring. Like my father.\"- \"He turn us his children into a joke too.\"- \"...it shame me to think that once upon a time I used to look on Stephen as a big man. Now I see that in the city Stephen is not much, that all his hope and all his daughters' hope is in that son who is studying in Montreal.\"- \"All afternoon as I walk I feel like a free man. I scorn everything I see, and when I tire myself out with walking, and the afternoon gone, I still scorn. I scorn the bus, the conductor, the street. I scorn the white boys who come in the shop in the evening.\"- \"Perhaps all those people hadn't died, and it didn't matter if they had. Perhaps the houseboy was just trying to make himself interesting. Perhaps nothing that happens here is more interesting than any other thing that happens.\"- \"'Walking around with a smashed watch. It's just the sort of sick thing you can do. But the most terrifying thing is how quickly you can adapt to having your whole life written off. At first I used to say, \"I'm going to get better next week.\" Then it was next month. Then it was next year.'\" (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "A.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4697007-a", "userReview": "No, not a novel--and although the title story is certainly long enough, it's not a novel either. It doesn't have the hermetic completeness that a novel is expected to have; it needs the others to say what it has to say. It needs the bookends, presented as a traveller's diary entries: of the privileged outside observing the coded power structures that keep the marginalized outsiders--and their oppressors!--in their place, from Ancient Egypt to Modern Greece. These vignettes come the closest to Naipaul's own register, although I'm not stupid enough to attribute the narratorial aloofness to the author himself. And he needs the opening novellas, first-person accounts of broken and dislocated men imperfectly searching their pasts for the moment they sacrificed their freedom. The first of these stories, \"One Out of Many\", is more accessible than the second, \"Tell Me Who To Kill.\" But the anguish of the second, its sense of human waste and unutterable rage, resonates more with me. And this brings us to the title story, of strangers in a strange land of their making but beyond their control, colonizers at the mercy of the colonized, an evocation of newfound freedom indistinguishable from repackaged captivity. I will add, by the way, that the character of the colonel, the menace he imparts to his houseboy Peter over the Volkswagen keys, the paranoia to which he clings, his embodiment of the ugliness of colonialism, is one of Naipaul's most dazzling achievements as a writer.As with all the other stories, I think Naipaul, in this third-person narrative, conceals his narrative voice in Bobby's; hence the endlessly stultifying descriptions of passing African landscape, the absolute refusal to enter the minds of Africans, the deliberate refusal on Naipaul's part to let the reader in on the nuances of this imagined political theater; it all reflects the last gasp of the imperialist, which has infected even someone as jaded--and marginalized--as Bobby. Gone is the fuzzy, heartwarming Naipaul of Mr Biswas; the author of these stories is pitiless and magisterial, his worldview bleak and fatalistic. I cannot say I enjoyed these stories--I struggled mightily through In A Free State--but I can respect Naipaul's game, and I think that they would reward re-reading. At the heart of this continent-spanning meditation on foreignness and rootless dislocation is the realization, perhaps, that the imperialist power structures that shaped much of this world corrode everyone implicated in them, the mighty and the weak, which in turn means there's really no way out of them--nobody you can kill to rid yourself of its corrosion. That may ultimately be what it means to live in a free state."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8068699-stephanie", "userReview": "I'm reading all the Booker Prize winners from 1969 onward. Follow me at: http://www.methodtohermadness.comI thought V.S. Naipaul\u2019s In a Free State would be a quick read. It consists of two short stories and a novella, bookended by two travel anecdotes. This is the fourth Booker Prize winner, and the third to explicitly address British colonialism. I loved the first story. I puzzled over the second. And I struggled through the third. The first story, \u201cOne out of Many,\u201d is about an Indian domestic, Santosh, who accompanies his employer, a government official, from Bombay to Washington, D.C. His debacle of an airplane trip seems to include every possible thing that could go wrong for a poor and na\u00efve traveler on his first long voyage. Once in the U.S., Santosh progresses through several stages: brave exploration, frightened sequestration, fleeing his employer, finding a new one. He is \u201cin a free state,\u201d but this freedom is more frightening than exhilarating, a leap into the void without a safety net. I sympathized with the character\u2019s adjustments and felt that this story did an excellent job distilling the immigrant experience into just forty pages. The second story, \u201cTell Me Who to Kill,\u201d sums up one facet of the immigrant experience this way: \u201cambition is like shame,\u201d that is, trying to rise \u201cabove\u201d your origins implies that you are ashamed of them. The title expresses the main character\u2019s frustration with being an island immigrant in London, and lack of target for his feelings. \u201cOnce you find out who the enemy is, you can kill him. But these people here they confuse me. Who hurt me? Who spoil my life?\u201d This story left me scratching my head: is the main character\u2019s companion just a friend, or are they gay? And what about the repeated murder sequence: is it a memory, a dream, or a scene from a movie? No way to know for sure.Finally, the title novella. Two white government employees travel through an unnamed African nation in turmoil: the president\u2019s tribe is out to kill the former king. Similar to J.G. Farrell\u2019s Troubles, the main character, Bobby, vacillates between sympathy for the natives and frustration with them, while confronting another character, Linda, who seems primarily scornful of them. Both Farrell and Naipaul seem to agree that the role of the British is to let the natives figure out their path for themselves. However, I felt the story dragged on and went over my head in places. It seemed like a series of \u201cin jokes\u201d that maybe only readers of the time or expats in Africa could understand."}, {"userName": "Praveen Palakkazhi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15444712-praveen-palakkazhi", "userReview": "Finally, my first Naipaul book, but this just didn\u2019t work for me. It could have something to do with the edition. The original book published back in 1971 had a couple of surrounding stories of the immigrant experience in various places, as well as some journal like entries apart from the central story. However, this edition published in 2011 was a standalone version of the central story only with a preface by the author on why he initially didn\u2019t think it was a good idea to publish the story on its own. Maybe he should have stuck to that instinct, though I\u2019m not sure how much different my reading experience would have been. Either way, the book had won the Booker in its early years, back in 1971.The story takes place in some unnamed African country, which is on the throes of internal turmoil and awaiting an uncertain future most likely resembling that of Idi Amin\u2019s Uganda. Two English people, not particularly affectionate of each other undertake a journey through the country to their Government workers compound and the illusion of safety. Along the way, they come across various characters and situations involving the natives, the army and fellow expatriates like them and learn that prejudices within themselves and others run deep despite all attempts to put up an outwardly fair face. The problem is, the writing was just too vague for me and the characters not particularly explored with much depth. Bobby and Linda remain mostly aloof and undecipherable and the empathy which the reader should feel for the characters just doesn\u2019t develop. In fact, this has to be one of the most boring road trips I\u2019ve read about. Perhaps a better understanding of the country\u2019s situation in that time period would have helped fill in some gaps in the story, but I\u2019m not sure it would have made a huge difference.I hope the other books by Naipaul are not a slog like this one, as I do have a couple more in my backlist to read. The best thing about this one was that it was a short and quick read."}], "description": "No writer has rendered our boundariless, post-colonial world more acutely or prophetically than V. S. Naipaul, or given its upheavals such a hauntingly human face. A perfect case in point is this riveting novel, a masterful and stylishly rendered narrative of emigration, dislocation, and dread, accompanied by four supporting narratives. In the beginning it is just a car trip through Africa. Two English people--Bobby, a civil servant with a guilty appetite for African boys, and Linda, a supercilious compound wife -- are driving back to their enclave after a stay in the capital. But in between lies the landscape of an unnamed country whose squalor and ethnic bloodletting suggest Idi Amin's Uganda. And the farther Naipaul's protagonists travel into it, the more they find themselves crossing the line that separates privileged outsiders from horrified victims. Alongside this Conradian tour de force are four incisive portraits of men seeking liberation far from home. By turns funny and terrifying, sorrowful and unsparing, In A Free State is Naipaul at his best.", "title": "In a Free State", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49742.In_a_Free_State", "average": 3.5, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328700259l/49742.jpg", "reviews": 172, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3989.V_S_Naipaul", "name": "V.S.
