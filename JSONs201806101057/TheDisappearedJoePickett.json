Box's latest Joe Pickett novel is a great addition to this outstanding series. Wyoming has a new, highly unpleasant governor who tasks Pickett with finding a missing British businesswomen. Meanwhile, Nate Romanowski drags Joe into another case on behalf of a group of falconers. The further Joe delves into both cases, the more he realizes that forces are at work to stop him from solving either case. Both mysteries were interesting and original, and the resolutions were satisfying. One of my favorite things about C.J. Box is that he integrates current events/policy issues into his novels informing readers about important issues while spinning a fabulous tale. The Disappeared tackles two such issues: a headline-grabbing, social media fueled item involving Wyoming dude ranches and an exception to wildlife protection policies granted to those operating clean energy businesses. I was fascinated to learn about both. All in all, The Disappeared is well worth the read!"}, {"userName": "Monnie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6277675-monnie", "userReview": "I do not like them, Sam I am: Cliffhangers, I mean. Not even when they happen in a favorite series and, Lord willin' and the creek don't rise, I have every intention of reading the next one. But that aside, I quite enjoyed this one (as I expected I would).As I've mentioned in other reviews, my interest in the series originated way back when because I share the surname of the central character, Joe Pickett, a Wyoming game warden. From that point on, though, I've kept reading simply because the books are so good - and this one's no exception despite the no-ending ending.In recent previous books (for the record, this is the 18th), Joe served as a sort of covert investigator at the pleasure of the governor. But now, there's a new gov in town, and when he, too, asks for help - this time in finding a high-flying British company owner who's disappeared months ago from an upscale vacation ranch - Joe can't help but wonder if there's more to the story than meets his ears. When Joe learns that his eldest daughter, Sheridan, works at the ranch, though, he figures she might have some inside information and agrees to take on the assignment (not that he really had a choice in the matter). Compounding the issue is that the game warden for the territory in which the ranch is located has gone missing as well.As if all that weren't enough, Joe is contacted by his old friend, top-notch falconer Nate Romanowski, who for the most part has shed his ne'er-do-well activities of the past and is playing nice with the powers-that-be. But Nate still doesn't trust the feds - he's especially wary of an enormous, government-subsidized wind turbine farm that's under construction not far from the ranch. For the moment, though, he's looking for Joe's help with lifting a ban on falconers who have permits to hunt with eagles but are not allowed to do so. Something untoward is going on, Nate insists, and he wants Joe to find out what it is and who's behind it.Joe gets a hearty welcome from local law enforcement, but from others, not so much; almost immediately, he has a run-in with a couple of shady characters, and not long thereafter, his hotel room is ransacked and the file on the missing British woman does a disappearing act. Joe's curiosity is further piqued when he notices missing files at the former game warden's cabin; who would have taken them and why?Everything that's happening is puzzling, and Joe is grateful for help from his back-home wife, Marybeth; she's a librarian and handles research tasks with ease. Daughter Sheridan also proves her mettle, earning newfound respect from dear old dad. One of the strengths of this series for me, in fact, has been watching the changes in the family as the daughters grow up and move out.As the complexity and possible connections among the various cases increase, Joe has his work cut out for him. Whether or not he's up to the task I'll leave to other readers to learn for themselves; but I will note that staying warm in the sub-zero temperatures of the Wyoming winter in far from the least of Joe's problems. To that end, perhaps he should pull a page from the books of other characters, who I suspect may be getting retainers (and maybe a new jacket every year or so) from outdoor apparel manufacturer Carhartt. If they're not, they should; the brand got mentioned no less than eight times throughout the book."}, {"userName": "LJ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/250195-lj", "userReview": "First Sentence: Wylie Frye was used to smelling of smoke and that was long before he became a criminal of sorts.Wyoming\u2019s new governor wants Game Warder Joe Pickett to find a wealthy CEO and Englishwoman who disappeared after staying at the dude ranch where Joe\u2019s daughter, Sheridan, works. Joe\u2019s friend, master falconer Nate Romanowski, want Joe to find out why the falconers can no longer hunt with eagles in spite of having valid permits. Joe wants to know why the Game Warden seems to have disappeared from the area where the ranch is located. And who is working hard to make Joe go away?Box is very good at creating a sense of place, and a sense of cold\u2014\u201cTwilight in the mountains brought a special kind of cold. It crept out from the darkness of the lodgepole pine forest where it had spent the daylight hours and it slithered across the top of the snow to sting every inch of exposed human skin. Sounds became sharper and the snow itself became a different texture that squeaked like nails on a chalkboard with every footfall.\u201d His description of what it\u2019s like to drive during the winter in the mountains conveys some of the dangers involved. And most of us don\u2019t think about the risks inherent with snowmobiling. There is fascinating information about the use of predator birds for protecting flocks and endangered birds, as well as killing animal predators, and all the political machinations involved. The relationship of falconry to Shakespeare is a nice touch.The perspective Joe has on how his relationship has changed with his now-grown daughter is one with which most can identify in some way. For those who have followed the series, it is particularly poignant. The contrast of Joe and Nate is always interesting. They truly are light and dark. Lance, Sheridan\u2019s boyfriend, is someone of whom I hope we see more. There\u2019s a lot in this book, almost too much. The threads do come together but awkwardly. There isn\u2019t the cohesion one finds in Box\u2019 previous books, and even the humor and suspense are less apparent. The motive is rather weak and far-fetched, particularly when we learn who is behind everything, and the ending rather abrupt. One dearly hopes Box isn\u2019t getting tired of his series. \u201cThe Disappeared\u201d is not Box\u2019s strongest book, but it\u2019s still better than a very good book by other authors.

Nonetheless, they are like a bit of cotton candy, tasty but without much substance. This is the 18th in the series of books centered around Joe Pickett, erstwhile Wyoming Game Warden and man who has destroyed more state cars than anyone in fiction or reality.Box has a formula for the Pickett stories - Joe is in the doghouse with his agency brass and is dispatched by the Governor to handle some problem that really has nothing to do with being a game warden, but which needs a man of discretion and integrity to deal with it. Shit goes badly wrong. Joe blows up a house or destroys a truck, or both, some bad guy or another ends up dead, and a conspiracy at the highest levels of business or government is uncovered, Joe is again persona non grata and he fears that his family will starve. His mother in law, a truly awful person, tries to get his wife to leave him.Before the Trump administration, these huge conspiracies felt a whole lot more fictional. But, I digress.Anyway, this one follows the formula. There's a new governor, as Governor Rulon has lost the election to a fancy pants ivy league rich guy Republican who looks the part of Governor, but has the grasping heart of any one of the Trumps, which is to say, he likes money and doesn't much care where it comes from. There's also a missing British woman who was vacationing at the very exclusive, very expensive, very five-star vacation ranch, a game warden who has just up and disappeared, and a puzzling situation with Nate Romanowski, master falconer. Joe is instructed to find out what happened to Kate, the missing woman, without making too many waves.Joe makes waves. It ends predictably, which is to say badly.I don't think that it would really be possible to pick this series up on book 18 and make a lot of sense out of the various characters and plot lines without the backstory of the preceding 17 installments. Nonetheless, it's a solid entry into the series, and an afternoon with Joe Pickett is always good fun."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643472-ed", "userReview": "Having read most books by CJ Box, I can't really get my head around the Grand Canyon size literary gap between his absolutely riveting 4 book \"Highway Quartet\" and the evolution of the Joe Picket series.

Box is a perplexing mystery about a missing person's case in Wyoming. Although this latest release is the eighteenth novel in the Joe Pickett series, it can easily be read as standalone.Joe Pickett is uneasy when new Governor Colter Allen wants him to look into the still unsolved disappearance of Kate Shelford-Longden. The\u00a0 high profile British ad agency CEO vanished on her way to the Denver airport after spending a week at upscale dude ranch outside of Saratoga.\u00a0 Joe has an inside track at the Silver Creek Ranch since his oldest daughter Sheridan works there as a horse wrangler. He is also joined by falconer and friend Nate Romanowski, who is a bit of a maverick when it comes to staying within the confines of the law.Joe has serious reservations about Allen's motives for asking him to look into Kate's disappearance but since his curiosity is piqued about what happened to fellow Game Warden Steve Pollock, he sets out for Saratoga.\u00a0 The case file he receives is light on theories and information and DCI Agent Michael Williams is not exactly eager to discuss the investigation. Nevertheless, \u00a0Joe \u00a0has little choice but to commence with the governor ordered search for Kate.Although the staff at the Silver Creek Ranch undergo rigorous vetting during the hiring process, the contractors who occasionally work for them are not. Farriers Brad and Ben Youngberg raise a few eyebrows due to their \"work hard, play harder\" attitude so they are definitely persons of interest. The father/son owners of the local fish farm also raise a few flags so they remain on the suspect list as well. Then there are curious nocturnal happenings that are occurring at the local mill owned by Jeb Pryor. His overnight employee Wylie Frye is earning extra money on the side but what exactly are the people who are paying him up to?Because Joe is pressed for time, Nate is involved in questioning some of their suspects. Nate inadvertently finds himself at a wind energy farm that completely shocks him due to the vast number of wind turbines under construction. \u00a0Nate has a conspiracy theory that ties in with his initial reason for meeting with Joe and this discovery certainly does not cast any doubt on his supposition. But how does the Buckbush Wind Energy Project fit in with the disappearances of game warden Steve Pollock, Kate Shelford-Longden and the the odd goings-on at Jeb's mill?Taking place during a bitter cold and snowy Wyoming winter, The Disappeared is an engrossing mystery which also features intriguing environmental issues that are socially relevant in today's world. Joe, Sheridan and Nate are intrepid amateur sleuths who methodically investigate Kate's disappearance along with the curious other things they uncover along the way. With Joe's future hanging in the balance, C.J. Box brings this latest addition to the Joe Pickett series to a gratifying conclusion that wraps up most of the novel's dangling threads. Fans of the series and genre will definitely enjoy this latest mystery starring the lovable, straight arrow game warden."}, {"userName": "Chris Conley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7209420-chris-conley", "userReview": "I love Joe Pickett.

Given suspiciously few resources and very little time, Joe is happy to accept the help of both his 23-year-old daughter, Sheridan, who works as a wrangler at the ranch, and comrade Nate Romanowski, who predictably approaches the case from beyond the law's boundaries.

Then you should definitely be checking out the latest novel from author C. J. Box in his Joe Pickett series.As \"The Disappeared\" opens, Pickett is waiting to meet the new governor, Colter Allen and his chief aide Connor Hanlon. Pickett is still operating as the \"range rider\" for the governor's office but after refusing to play politics with a previous \"request\" from Governor Allen, our favorite game warden finds himself on the outside looking in.So when he's temporarily assigned to a different district in order to investigate the disappearance of a famous and well off British woman, he can't exactly say no. But once he arrives at his posting, he soon learns that things aren't what they seem. The district's previous game warden has just up and disappeared with no explanation and while there seems to be a bunch of viable suspects, there's absolutely no evidence of the missing woman.If that wasn't enough for Joe, he's dealing with oldest daughter Sheridan, who works at the tourist ranch from where the woman disappeared from, and the realization that as a 23 year old college graduate, she has a life. Which means a serious boyfriend. And then there's Nate Romanowski, the master falconer, who barges into Joe's life looking for his help on an issue of federal permits and eagles.While Joe doesn't really know what to do to help Nate, the two end up investigating the leads they turn up on the missing woman. But they are hampered by the woman's sister and a headline seeking muckraker reporter from England as well as being pressured from all sides to solve what appears to be an unsolvable case.Worse yet, there just might be more than meets the eye when it comes to why Pickett was assigned to the case.What I like about this book and the series as a whole is how Box can take both issues of the day and a setting that I would never care about or find myself in and make me want to do both of those things. He lays things out with enough information for readers to get a grasp of events without being overly preachy about things or sacrificing the tension filled drama of the main story.The continuing subplots of the Pickett family continue to entertain and with Sheridan now a fully grown adult, it is nice to see how she's becoming more immersed in the main plotline rather than simply as one of Joe's daughters. She gets two particularly bad ass scenes in this book and all I could think of was how much I wish I'd been there to see it for myself.While not exactly a cliffhanger, the ending of the story leaves Joe, thanks the re-emergence of an old recurring and familiar foe, in quite the precarious state. This will leave readers a bit overanxious to see what happens next because at this point, you will wonder how exactly Pickett doesn't just get \"all Western\" over what certain parties are doing to him and his career.There's plenty of action in this book but even when bullets aren't whizzing by or fists aren't flying, there's so much to take in that you will find yourself forgetting where you are as you keep turning another page. Who can ask for anything more?"}, {"userName": "Ariana Fae", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29984848-ariana-fae", "userReview": "It was so fun to drop back into Joe Pickett's world in THE DISAPPEARED. As usual trouble always seems to find Joe Pickett, or should I say follows him. C.J Box once again places Joe in a situation in which it is more than it seems.There was a lot happening in this story: finding a missing well known British executive, dealing with a new governor and his right hand side who dislikes Joe, and Nate Romanowski asking Joe for help with a conspiracy theory. As much as I was entertained by those plots, my favorite thing about this book, as in every Joe Pickett novel, is how Box masterly develops Joe's relationships with with family and Nate. I loved Sheridan had a significant part in this book helping her father out with the missing woman mystery. Box shows us the woman Sheridan has become and you can't help but like her. It was enjoyable seeing Joe realize his little girl is all grown up and slowly accepting it. There was a scene in which we see how bad ass she can be, just like she was when her life was in danger in OPEN SEASON, which made me like her instantly. There is also another conspiracy Nate discovers that directly deals with Joe. And let me tell you when you find out what it is you'll hate a certain character even more.THE DISAPPEARED is filled with conspiracies, betrayals, current events, touching family moments, and of course a good mystery.

The new governor of Wyoming, who Joe does not get along with, assigns him to find a missing tourist at the exclusive Silver Creek Ranch. The woman is from England, and has been missing since she left the ranch a few months before the present time. At the same time, there is a huge wind turbine development going on by a group of investors; the idea is to produce more green energy to supply southern California. Environmental impact reports seem to have been rushed through, and many of the locals and the people in Game and Fish are extremely concerned, because birds such as bald and golden eagles have been killed due to the huge turbines. On the sly, some company people have been bribing the man who runs the old \"tipi\" burner to use the burner for getting rid of the evidence in the environmental case. Nate Romanowski, Joe's master falconer friend, becomes involved in the case because of a proposal to use golden eagles in hunting. Sheridan Pickett, Joe's daughter is working as a wrangler at the exclusive Silver Creek Ranch, and Joe and his wife are a bit concerned with a budding romance between her and the head wrangler, Lance. The author does a great job in taking all of these individual story threads and weaving them all together into a really suspenseful and great story."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41955054-donna", "userReview": "For me, a series doesn't get any better than this one!Wyoming Game Warden Joe Pickett meets the newly elected governor at the airport to receive his next assignment. The governor sends him to Encampment, Wyoming where a prominent British CEO, Kate Shelford-Longden disappeared without a trace a few months ago. She left the dude ranch at the end of her vacation but didn't make it to the airport to fly home. Also, the local game warden in Encampment is missing. Looks like he just walked out the door one day. Readers learn early on in the book that the night watchman at a burner mill is taking a payoff to allow a couple of guys to put something in the white hot flames to burn up. The closest neighbor notices a peculiar smell in the air during the night. What is being incinerated to produce that odd smell? I could only think of one thing. After all, people are missing.Joe's oldest daughter Sheridan plays a prominent role in this story. She's a wrangler at the dude ranch. Joe's best friend Nate is also on hand with an issue of falcons and eagles. I liked the descriptions of the huge wind farm. There's one not far from me and I'm in awe when I drive close and look up at those huge blades. As always, Box's descriptions of the outdoors are picturesque. I was surprised more than once throughout and near the end of the book and I love those type of conclusions!"}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19704755-patricia", "userReview": "THE EFFECT OF SELF-ABSORPTIONThe book, revolves, loosely, around three things: the disappearance of a tourist, a wind farm and the underground problems of even \"green\" energy, and Wyoming politics.First, the politics and energy are inter-related in Wyoming. This author obviously watches Wyoming politics, and he understands, sees, the reality. Wyoming is ranked read last for government transparency, and may, as a result, be kind of high in government corruption. It's hard to say. I find his government officials, by and larfe, TOTALLY believable.The energy company minions may or may not be realistic. I wish I could say they are not, but a lingering suspicion says that since people from other walks of life have acted this way, yikes! These guys may be accurate too.The game warden is realistic, in my experience.The landscapes are superb. The distances are maybe compressed.I really enjoyed the book."}, {"userName": "Caryn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10731315-caryn", "userReview": "Joe Pickett had in the past worked on special projects for the governor. But there is a new governor of Wyoming, one that doesn\u2019t much like Pickett the relationship Pickett had with his predecessor. So Joe was surprised to receive a summons to meet Governor Allen aboard his plane. While the governor wanted Joe\u2019s help, it was not a friendly request as from his predecessor, but rather an order for Joe to temporarily take the place of a game warden who apparently left in the middle of an investigation of a missing English woman. If he failed, the threat to Joe\u2019s career was clear. Further, under no circumstances was Joe\u2019s falconer friend Nate Romanowski to be anywhere near the investigation-as if Joe has any control over anything Nate does.Tourism is important to Wyoming and most especially to the various dude ranches popping up around the state. Silver Creek Ranch was the most luxurious, most expensive and as fate would have it, the very ranch where Pickett\u2019s daughter Sheridan was employed. It is also where the very wealthy Kate Shelford-Longden was staying before she disappeared on her way to the airport. The press both here and overseas had been on the story from the beginning and with no breaks coming, the Governor is understandably anxious to find out what happened.Joe understands the urgency although he is puzzled by the absence of the game warden of record for the region. When he arrives in town, he finds that not only has the warden left, he obviously left in a hurry leaving much of his belongings behind. If people know why the warden left they aren\u2019t talking, or at least not to Pickett.Before Pickett has time to really get started in the investigation, the sister of the missing woman along with a reporter from England show up and muddy the investigation with their own agendas. And then there is Nate who again appears wanting Joe to look into why falconers with valid permits are not being allowed to capture and hunt with eagles. This is the eighteenth book in the series, and is probably my second most favorite thus far. There is in addition to the main plot of what happened to the English woman, the subplots of the missing game warden and Nate with his eagles. They do all tie together in the end, but it takes awhile to get there. In the meantime, readers are given such a graphic description of a Wyoming Winter that they\u2019d best bring an extra afghan to their reading chair. As once again, Box has through his words put the reader on the scene of the book. Once again Nate plays an important part and this time out is perhaps a bit more restrained than in some of the books. Readers learn a little bit more about the history of falconry and how it is practiced in the West today. His subplot brings home an environmental issue created by \u201cclean\u201d wind energy.I would recommend this book for new to the series readers in that while Pickett\u2019s family is mentioned and his daughter Sheridan plays a role in the story, they are for the most part not part of this book. The Disappeared gives readers a chance to meet Joe Pickett, see him in action and learn enough of his backstory through references to be able to jump in and enjoy the book.That said, as much as I love Joe Pickett, I would love to see a book with Nate Romanowski as the protagonist."}], "description": "Wyoming game warden Joe Pickett has two cases to contend with, both of them lethal, in the electrifying new novel from the #1 New York Times-bestselling author.Wyoming's new governor isn't sure what to make of Joe Pickett, but he has a job for him that is extremely delicate. Three British executives, all women, never came home from the high-end guest ranch they were visiting, and the British Embassy is pressing hard. Pickett knows that happens sometimes--these ranches are stocked with handsome young cowboys, and \"ranch romances\" aren't uncommon. But three disappearances? That's too many.At the same time, with the help of his friend Nate Romanowski, he's been called to investigate the killings of several bald and golden eagles--a serious federal crime. The more he investigates both cases, the more someone wants him to go away. Is it because of the missing woman or the dead eagles? Or are they somehow connected?
