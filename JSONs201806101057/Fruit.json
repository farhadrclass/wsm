Peter is focused more on his weight, especially his nipples, but the need to avoid bullies, nasty comments etc. at any cost is frightening. Peter certainly had a wonderful imagination in order to cope wether, it was his nipples and the various funny ways of taming them, or the unique escape via \"The Bedtime Movies\", loved the descriptions, and the role Peter played in them.As a Gay Man now my 70th year I could not help but think about how courageous Brian is to write in this manner, since I well recall the 50-60 etc, the fear of having your sexual orientation revealed could be devastating. Then I remember that thank god times have changed, well for most people.Peter's family life was unique and certainly whacky his one Sister working for Peoples, telling him never to come into the store, while she was there, Sarnia wow, his Dear Mother having difficulty in deciding which restaurant to go to, as well the hairs Peter would put on his desk to see if his Mother looked in his drawers, and finding them broken started leaving notes for her to find.Mr Hanlan, I was hoping that some relationship might have developed out of this crush on him, just to make Peter feel wanted.......Adored Daniela, her Italian background with her family restaurant,her parents described well, I could hear their accents, her attempt at becoming # 1 in womens contest, Peters loyalty to her.I read it again a few days later, and really got the feel of the characters,and found it witty, caring, in how Peter dealt with growing pains,by using his imagination as an escape, and in many ways being loyal to friends or relatives.I cannot believe I missed reading this book earlier I highly recommend this book to anyone."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1424859-bonnie", "userReview": "4 StarsPassionately defended by Jen Sookfong Lee (End of East), Fruit made it to the final two in CBC\u2019s 2009 Canada Reads. If you missed this exciting week, and/or know little about Fruit by Brian Francis, I can say unequivocally that is is it a delightful read, and at no time inauthentic. Written in the first person, this novel, set in the early 1980\u2019s, makes us privy to Peter Paddington\u2019s immediate thoughts, most especially the fantasy world he inhabits: his cherry-sized nipples, which pop out and talk to him, despite his attempts to shut them up with masking tape; the telepathic messages he sends to people; the bedtime \u201cmovies\u201d he creates to lull himself to sleep. An overweight 13 year-old Peter is ridiculed at school, especially by the \u201cBangers\u201d. He spends his recess breaks as a library assistant, and eats lunch at home with his hormonal mother. Peter would love to make his dad happy by participating in sports and making friends, but mild-mannered Dad is unwilling to accept Mom\u2019s insistance that there isn\u2019t anything wrong with their boy. Yet, it is Dad who signs the papers so that Peter can take Home Ec instead of Shop.Then there is neighbour Daniela, an unattractive girl who wets the bed, swears an awful lot, and wants to be a beauty queen. Peter comes to realize that he isn\u2019t any more socially acceptable than she is. And while Peter doesn\u2019t appear to realize he is gay -- despite his dressing up to perform as Olivia Newton John, or pouring over the men\u2019s underwear in the Sears catalogue -- the reader certainly does. He keeps thinking he needs to get a \u201cboy friend\u201d but somehow never concatenates to \u201cboyfriend\u201d.This quick read is a book any adolescent (or adult who can recall those days) will be able to identify with in some way. Recommended."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9242149-michelle", "userReview": "My husband bought this book for me for Christmas about seven years ago when we were living in Chicago. Why? Because he read a portion of the novel and laughed at a part where the main character, Peter Paddington, places Band Aids over his nipples to keep them quiet.Once I started reading the book, it was all over. There are so many laugh out loud moments in this book. The main character is an overweight high schooler who is babied with sugary, fat treats from his mother and has zilch social skills. His only friend is an awkward Italian girl named Danielle. Danielle is one of the funniest characters in a novel. She is a potty mouthed, curly-haired Italian beast who is riddles with disillusion as to who she is. She tells many tells of boys who try to court her and even goes as far to join a beauty pageant.Anyway, the whole book is first person narration, and we see slowly what is going on with Peter as he suffers the most embarrassing moments thanks to his parents, peers and lastly, his two really red nipples that just won't leave him alone.Read it, you need it!"}, {"userName": "Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1663699-taylor", "userReview": "I read the description of this book and HAD to read it. I just had to. I'm so glad I did. While this book did not turn out to be what I had expected, I enjoyed it much more than I had expected. It's not really about crazy talking nipples and it's not just your typical coming of age story. It's about an insecure but imaginative 13 year old boy and how he handles going through things he doesn't even realize he's going through. It's strange, but being 13 is strange, and this book found a way to make even the most uncomfortable, embarrassing, and even troubling things funny. I loved Peter and the whole time I just wanted to be 13 and to be his friend. This book might not be for everyone, but read it anyway!"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1685607-mary", "userReview": "One of the five novels chosen for Canada Reads for March 2-6, 2009.

Any guys who have struggled with their weight as a teenager knows it's just downright embarrassing to be cursed with man-boobs. What's even worse is that Peter has imaginary conversations with his nipples. His nipples are telling him what to do even to the point of daring him. Peter is just a fat paperboy who is just not quite like the other guys. He isn't into sports, which is a disappointment for his dad. He rather be in Home Ec. class. He trades stickers with the girls. He has fantasies about the cute married man across the street. He \"makes sperm\" with the showerhead. Can you say gay? However, *Fruit* doesn't really dwell much on homosexuality but rather implies it. More like we all know he's gay but he doesn't know it himself.His goal is to be skinny and normal like the other guys by the time he hits 9th grade in the Fall. However, he keeps postponing the day that he'll really start the diet. He has to deal with his family. His mother is going through The Change. His father is just distant. His sisters are fighting more than usual. His embarrassing and talkative Uncle Ed keeps hanging around.*Fruit* is a simple read with some occasional humor. The talking nipples is just really odd as having man-boobs is already embarrassing enough."}, {"userName": "Leya", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16464075-leya", "userReview": "I was pleasantly surprised with this book. I had a preconceived idea that I wouldn't like it, but I was hooked from the first paragraph. Which I just have to share:\"My name is Peter Paddington. I just started grade 8 at Clarkedale Elementary School. Six days a week, I deliver the Sarnia Observer and the other day my nipples popped out.\"Then, I just sat and read. And laughed, and laughed. All thoroughout the book I thought poor kid, he has no real friends, with a dysfunctional family, his mother going through Menopause and he's going through puberty, plus he has weight issues. But the book was written in way that made it funny, because you kind of remember going through the change as well. But what was really touching was his confusion, actually his questions about his own sexuality. He likes girls but doesn't feel anything for them. He prefers boys, but he's afraid that that would make him a freak. Poor Peter. I enjoyed the ending. In a way it was about a resolution and sticking to it. Even though his nipples were still talking to him. Yep, really...You need to read this book! It was time well spent. 4.5/5"}, {"userName": "Sasha Boersma", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11109777-sasha-boersma", "userReview": "I may have been laughing at this book more out of his stories of Sarnia than his \"coming of age\" tale. Or maybe it's just the memory of coming of age in Sarnia. While key locations had their names changed, I knew where everything was he mentioned, as that was in the same neighbourhood as my childhood. Right down to the flowering-tree lined streets Which is why I loved it. Too often Canadian literature passes over southwestern Ontario, let alone small working class cities which, socially, is quite quirky. Thank you Brian Francis for telling our story in this setting, and thank you ECW Press for printing it. It helps validate life in towns/cities like Sarnia as part of the overall Canadian framework.That aside, the story itself is really funny. Although, you sometimes forget it's from the perspective of a 14-yr old boy, as it read much older. But, it is a first published novel. I'm willing to overlook that.PS. So tempted to write out the passages specific to the quirks of life in Sarnia to archive in this review, as many made me actually LOL.[edit notes: originally typed on a touch screen which just went wrong in so many ways, cleaned up spelling and grammar]"}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4843541-cheryl", "userReview": "I loved this coming of age tale of an overweight, shy, just beginning to figure out he's gay, thirteen year old boy. He's very naive, and is highly uncomfortable with the changes that puberty has wrought upon his body. Like most teens he feels alienated from his caring but clueless parents who are dealing with their own problems and his self absorbed older sisters who treat him as a nuisance at best and pariah at worst. He has a friend in Daniela, the foul mouthed neighbour girl that works in her parents restaurant. She's crude, and overly confident; but Peter is both loyal and protective of her. He becomes a closet Catholic for a while, thanks to Daniela's influence, but he is more entranced by the pageantry then any actual spiritual calling.I loved Peter and would have liked to know how he was doing in 2012. I figured he must be just under 40 years old if the story took place in the mid to late 80's. I'd like to think for Peter Paddington it did indeed get better."}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5809296-helen", "userReview": "This was a first novel in which the author has spilled an entire childhood of fear and loathing onto the page. Peter is horrified by his suddenly noticeable nipples talking to him, criticising, bullying, and generally making his life miserable. He buys rolls of making tape and tapes himself up to hide the nipples and later substitutes an elastic bandage. He tries to figure out what the world is about, why he doesn't have friends, what the code is that everyone seems to be speaking, and what he should do about anything and everything. The writing is so funny that laughing out loud would be inevitable if it weren't so sad. He can't get up enough nerve to tell anyone about what is happening to him so he doesn't get any help, but given that this is not a present day story he probably wouldn't have got much help, except possibly from his mother who realizes what her own brother is."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10434298-steve", "userReview": "A quirky book about an obese, gay teenager going through puberty in Sarnia, Ontario. \"Fruit\" chronicles what you would expect: an odd but loving family, odd but loving neighbourhood characters, and the imaginative internal life of an isolated kid trying to accept himself for who he truly is.Still, it's told well with enough memorable characters and events that it doesn't feel too much like tired ground. Francis injects enough pathos into his humour to make for a compelling read and ground the book so that the people only feel slightly caricaturized.It's a fun, personal book that isn't especially groundbreaking, but feels indelibly honest about the strangeness of finding yourself."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/758046-amy", "userReview": "This was absolutely hilarious! Awesome first book!Story of an overweight teen who is horrified when 'his nipples pop out' and spends the whole book taping them down so that no one notices. Oh, and they talk to him, too!Told first person POV, and Peter's voice is nailed perfectly. The way he thinks and talks is so true for a person Peter's age.Toward the end, Peter was working on losing weight. My only complaint is that we never fully got to see him try and see if he was successful. Screw if he lost anything, I just wanted to know if he did.

Rather disturbing in some ways, though. I always felt embarrassed for and of the protagonist. He's very awkward, and yet normal...I think it's his obesity that made me most embarrassed, though his sexual thoughts also made me feel like I was invading his privacy. A very unusual book in that sense, though for young male teens who are obese and/or gay, this book may be what they need to affirm themselves as valuable. I like his friend Daniela, too, and I think she opens the book to be relevant for young females.And how many books actually take place in Sarnia, Ontario?

And probably the first young adult/puberty book I've read from a male perspective. I devoured it in two days and I was dismayed to see it end.It is hard to write young people's voices without sounding overly precocious or obnoxious but Brian Francis achieves this feat successfully. While his character's motivations can at times be annoying, my thinking is that they are only so because they hit so close to home. He has so finely tuned the magnified self-awareness that teens have while at the same time, being at their most misguided points in life. He delicately balances heart, emtional honesty and humour.I am excited to see the other books that Francis has and excitedly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/648861-amy", "userReview": "So I was a little bit of a loser in Junior High, but I had it great compared to Peter Paddington. He has talking man-boobs, his only friend is this crazy, hairy, potty-mouthed Catholic girl on his street, and he has fruity secret fantasies! But in spite of all this, Peter's voice is never too whiny and the book manages to have a sense of humor about itself while also being strangely inspiring. Those who are expecting a typical coming-of-age and coming out story might be disappointed, because the book's more unsettlingly ambigious about Peter's future as a gay man, but that adds to the realism of the book and gives it a wider audience than the LGBT community. The P.S. extras at the back of this edition include a very good dialogue between Dan Savage and the author."}, {"userName": "BookCupid", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5178308-bookcupid", "userReview": "If my nipples could speak they'd say, \"Terrific, terrific, terrific book.\" (Because if they were to sound more eloquent than me, like Peter I would tape over them and shut them up.) However, this book goes well beyond the topic of nipples. Yes, Peter is gay, but he hasn't figured it out yet. And so the book stopped being about sexual identity at all.
