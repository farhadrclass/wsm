Her mother is constantly moaning at her and when her sisters come home at weekends, it seems their main hobby is to be spiteful to Ruby herself. Many years ago, a case belonging to her grandmother had been stashed away in the attic, and when Ruby now finds and opens it she is in for quite a shock. She will find there was more to her grandmother than met the eye.We also see the return of Jamie, our misremembered man, complete with his comb-over, as well as Paddy and Rose. I was pleased to see Rose back to her normal self. I didn\u2019t like the direction her character took in Disenchanted Widow but she seems back to her old self now \u2013 liking a good chat, caring for the men in her life, surrounding herself with knick knacks. Not above interfering in someone else\u2019s business, she has a heart of gold nonetheless.Once again we have a newcomer to meet, this time Dr Henry Shelvin \u2013 a psychiatrist who has come on a short term contract over the summer. In a farming community where loneliness and depression can go hand in hand, he is going to be busy. But what about about Henry himself, a man whose wife has disappeared without trace? It is a well told story with just a hint of the supernatural in there, one that you can get lost in with a bunch of characters who are certainly colourful and at times eccentric and maybe just a touch stereotypical but who you will still care for. It made me smile more than a few times, especially at some of the things Rose says, but is also quite moving in places. A thoroughly entertaining read. Thanks to the publishers for the review copy."}, {"userName": "Melinda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30751354-melinda", "userReview": "McKenna delves into the subject matter of deep dark secrets, faith, grief, redemption and love with plenty of enthusiasm.We meet three varying characters dealing with loss as their paths intersect. Each backstory differing yet parallel in the end.Set in Ireland circa 1980\u2019s, you are privy to snapshots of landscape along with the culture, and political strife. A small farming hamlet is depicted as well as city life. Religious differences are referenced. You have a strong sense of community in this quaint little town nestled a distance from the city.The narrative is bursting, however, McKenna manages it well. Essentially three threads are introduced as well as their players seamlessly. Their converging becomes clearer as the story progresses. With diversity throughout the triple threads I felt it was rather clever and added texture.All the characters are well drawn, you know of their vibrant personalities and idiosyncrasies. Ruby tugs at your heart, you hope she stands up for herself and when she shows promise you\u2019ll be cheering her on. The magnitude of her grief is felt and you are affected by her tremendous loss. Jamie is sweet and you hope he sets himself on track again. Paddy and Rose are nothing less than charming.As you turn the pages familiarizing yourself with characters and their trials you find yourself absorbed. Quite a moving story, it\u2019s subtle packing a powerful punch. Rather unique, lacking predictability, as it pulls together you will find yourself captivated. A wonderful story touching on family, love, faith and learning to move forward, dealing with loss."}, {"userName": "Cindy Roesel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5581809-cindy-roesel", "userReview": "In the very early 80s, my father married an Irish woman with six kids. She was seriously Irish, first generation from Athenry, County Galway. When they moved in, almost everything was replaced in the color green, Mondays were corned beef and cabbage and all they, and soon we, talked about were The Troubles. Picking up Christina McKenna's, THE GODFORSAKEN DAUGHTER got my Irish up a bit. I remember learning to make traditional Irish soda bread, attempting to cross stitch and throwing up after sneaking Irish whiskey, which I was much too young to drink. Back to 2015, I don't know about you, but Monday, I had a lovely St. Patrick's Day!******THE GODFORSAKEN DAUGHTER is set in the 1980s Ireland. Ruby Clare loves her father and looks forward to working with him out in the farm fields every day. But he dies, leaving behind the 63-acre farm, Ruby, her mother and nasty twin sisters. First thing her mother does is forbid Ruby to work outside on the farm and turns her into her private servant. Her sisters live in Belfast but come home to Tailorstown on weekends to add a special sisterly brand of torture to Ruby's already dismal existence. The only bit of joy she has is in the form of Jamie McCloone, a lonely bachelor farmer she knows.Dr. Henry Shelvin is a psychiatrist in Belfast. His wife, Constance goes missing one night and he proceeds to spend all his time looking for her. It's destroying him, but this is also a time of unrest in Belfast. There's a civil war waging between the Protestant IRA and the Catholics and he is told to \"lay low\" to stop looking for her, but nothing more. He leaves Belfast for Tailorstown and finds peace working with small town patients while never losing hope he'll find his wife.The two stories come together in a somewhat awkward way. In some ways, they seemed as if they were two different novels. As I was reading, I found myself invested in Ruby's story that I couldn't stop until the end and was satisfied with the resolution of how everything turned out. THE GODFORSAKEN DAUGHTER somehow feels like a step back in time, with McKenna's lyrical portraits of the countryside. It's a story of family, love and faith. This is the third novel in Christina McKenna's, Tailorstown Series."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6751264-becky", "userReview": "It's been seven months since his death but Ruby Clare still mourns the loss of her beloved father. The two were close, sharing a love of the land and a bond that no one else in the family could understand. Since his death, Ruby's mother has leased off the land and forcing her to give up farming for good. And while her two sisters work in Belfast during the week, Ruby stays home to keep house and care for their mother. With daily criticism from her mother and weekends spent terrorized by her sisters, Ruby has never been more morose. Then Ruby discovers an old case belonging to her paternal grandmother. It appears in her own grief, Ruby's grandmother turned to the ancient Goddess Dana for solace. In her, Ruby too finds comfort and the promise of change. But when Ruby's mother catches wind of it, she begins to threaten her daughter with exorcisms and a trip to the local asylum! Enter Doctor Henry Shevlin. Henry is new to the area, working as temporary psychiatrist while the town's actual doctor is away on research. And even with his own woes hanging heavy, Henry can offer a voice of reason and support for people like Ruby. I really enjoyed this read from McKenna. It's set in the early 80s, amidst the IRA bombings and threats of the era and while this isn't a HUGE part of the plot, it does play into it to a good extent. And really there are two main stories here: that of Ruby Clare and her family and that of Henry Shevlin.Ruby's tale is the main focus of the book. She's a bit downtrodden, understandable given her situation. Her mother has never really shown any affection for her and even her mother's friends are incredibly critical of the girl. Living in a small town where gossip is gold makes things even worse. McKenna does a fabulous job with the characters that dwell in and around Tailorstown. From the local priest to the post mistress and even the town sheriff, each character - no matter how small or how infrequently seen - is rich in detail. And like any town, some of them are nice and some of them are a little nasty.Henry Shevlin's story is quite interesting as well. It's through him that we get more of the political climate of the time. It's a bit of a shame really that his story is kind of pushed to the side in lieu of Ruby's tale. It would seem that Henry and his wife might be deserving of their own book, to be quite honest. And this is really The Godforsaken Daughter's only big downfall. I felt like Shevlin's story was too big to be a secondary story.If you enjoy small town settings and family drama (and this family is full of drama) you'll like The Godforsaken Daughter. This is the third book set in the Tailorstown but it's not at all necessary to have read either of the previous books."}, {"userName": "Susan Barton", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10769384-susan-barton", "userReview": "Ruby Clare is thirty-three, unmarried and still lives at home on the family farm with her bitter, abusive mother. Since Ruby\u2019s beloved father died suddenly, Ruby\u2019s day consists of knitting tea cozies, and waiting hand and foot on Martha Clare. Ruby\u2019s spoiled twin sisters, May and June, don\u2019t make life any easier for Ruby. Although they work in the city, they come home on weekends to visit Martha and to torment shy, overweight Ruby. Meanwhile, psychiatrist Henry Shevlin\u2019s life is in turmoil. His wife, Constance, went for a walk and never returned. After a year of searching for her, he\u2019s decided to attempt to move on by relocating from the city of Belfast to the more rural location of Killoran. Henry settles into his new surroundings nicely while treating some pretty quirky characters, but he never stops hoping Constance will return. There\u2019s a lot going on in The Godforsaken Daughter \u2013 several stories are intertwined and told. While at first it seems to start out as yet another spin on the classic Cinderella story, readers will be quite happy to see that it is so much more than that. Christina McKenna has woven a beautiful tapestry of characters, set against the glorious backdrop of Northern Ireland. Her characters are so charming, compelling and well developed, I was immediately invested in their well-being. I wanted to hug Ruby and tell her everything would be okay.There are some definite religious undertones at play in The Godforsaken Daughter, but this is Northern Ireland in the 80s after all, so it\u2019s to be expected. The Troubles between Protestants and Catholics are injected at various points in the story. The IRA and British authorities play an important role as well. Ruby\u2019s experimentation with the occult is short-lived and met with negative consequences. The ending is magnificent and I felt very satisfied with the way the author put all the pieces together. The story was never contrived or overdone. While reading The Godforsaken Daughter, which I did in one day since it was so wonderful, I found myself searching for more of Christina McKenna\u2019s books. I love her writing and have every intention of reading all of her books. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading engaging stories of life, love and perseverance. http://ebookreviewgal.com received a complimentary ARC of this book from Net Galley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22824800-rachel", "userReview": "Like a comical Irish version of the Cinderella story, Ruby's life becomes that of a sorry house-slave to her waspish critical mother Martha after her beloved father dies. Her life suddenly changes when she discovers her late grandmother's old suitcase full of secrets, tarot cards and mysterious occult things. Ruby embarks on a voyage of exploration and discovery, ending with her mother enlisting the help of both the parish priest and the psychiatrist Henry Devlin, to deal with a daughter she believes is clearly possessed or insane. Henry himself is dealing with the tragedy of his wife's mysterious disappearance and has a host of interesting patients including s would-be John Lennon and the mildly comical farmer James McCloone, depressed over the death of his dog. All these characters weave together to create a sweet and quaint story. Light-hearted and humorous, this would make a funny movie."}, {"userName": "John C Wells", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40185549-john-c-wells", "userReview": "Thought provoking inside look to country life in a troubled country. Very lovable characters and one you first despise but feel sorrow for too. Ideas one doesn't normally have about faeries and spiritual rituals are thought provoking and eye opening as one realizes most of us face times when we seek new ways to cope with circumstances beyond our control. The conflict that emerges for people caught up in the 'troubles' is an interesting sub-story and one I was not aware of.

Ruby Vivian Clare is a farmer, right down to her thick bones. When Ruby\u2019s father dies of a heart attack, her livelihood is stripped from her hands by a mother who seems to hate every ounce of Ruby\u2019s being.Relegated to tending the house and acting as maid servant to her mother and spiteful, younger sisters, May and June, Ruby\u2019s life is a not-so-quiet torturing of the soul. The sisters live in Belfast but come home every weekend to be waited on hand and foot. Their favorite hobby is belittling Ruby, poking fun at her plumpness in comparison to their perfect beauty. While alive, Ruby\u2019s father kept the peace and protected her from the brunt of attacks. On her own, Ruby can do no right, despite her meek and hard-working demeanor.Martha Clare, Ruby\u2019s mother, is a widow burdened with secrets and resentment toward her late husband\u2019s mother, Edna Clare \u2013 a woman banished to a room on the second floor of their home, Oaktree House. Despite Edna\u2019s passing years ago, Martha can still feel her presence and orders the last of her mother-in-law\u2019s personal possessions be destroyed by fire.The dutiful Ruby disobeys when she retrieves the dubious suitcase from the attic and hides it in her room. Inside, she discovers the implements of an unearthly craft \u2013 a crystal ball, a disk engraved with a five-pointed star, a curved blade in the shape of a crescent moon, and a small silver cup. Ruby cautiously explores through the remaining layers of contents, finally uncovering a book written in her paternal grandmother\u2019s hand entitled The Book of Light.Hearing the voice of Edna Clare in her head, Ruby begins to act differently \u2013 speaking her mind, standing up to Martha, her sisters, and any other busybody in town who sticks their nose into her business. Emboldened by the powerful words in The Book of Light, Ruby formulates three wishes: 1) She wants to see her father again; 2) She wants to have lots of money; and 3) She wants to meet someone nice and be happy.When May catches Ruby attempting to carry out the \u201cspell\u201d as written in the book under the light of the full moon, the family is thrown into an uproar over Ruby\u2019s outrageous behavior. A call is first made for a psychiatrist, then a priest.Dr. Henry Shevlin responds to the emergency \u2013 a level-headed man who quickly recognizes the real problem stems from Martha\u2019s controlling and judgmental temperament. He refuses to commit Ruby to St. Ida\u2019s mental institution but agrees to treat her as an outpatient.Dr. Shevlin\u2019s story revolves around the mysterious disappearance of his wife, Constance, a year earlier. In order to escape the painful truths discovered during the investigation, Henry leaves Belfast for a three-month position at the Rosewood Clinic near Tailorstown. Among his patients are a man who thinks he\u2019s John Lennon, Ruby Clare and Jamie McCloone, who has taken up the bottle and entered a new state of depression.SPOILER Rose McFadden returns as Jamie\u2019s champion and determined matchmaker. When she meets Ruby at the scene of a near-fatal collision due to May panicking at the wheel, she decides on the spot the robust dairymaid is a perfect match for Jamie and may be the real cure to what ails him. SPOILERTHE GODFORSAKEN DAUGHTER is a perfect complement to the first two books and makes the reader beg for more. The cross over plots between Dr. Shevlin and his patients seemingly have no connection, but all is revealed in an ending which leaves you applauding for Ruby and smiling for Henry."}], "description": "When Ruby Clare\u2019s father was alive, they happily toiled together on their small dairy farm in Northern Ireland.

Then comes the day when Ruby finds her late grandmother\u2019s old suitcase in the attic.
