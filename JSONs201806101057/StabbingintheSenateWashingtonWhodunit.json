She lives with her wealthy boyfriend and they share a lovable beagle named Clarence. She works for Senator Lyndon Langsford and her boyfriend works mostly from home. They have what I would call a very comfortable relationship.Kit was unable to present a memo to Senator Langsford yesterday so she goes in early to work to insure that he has it before a very important committee meeting. She is surprised that her boss has beaten her to work. He is in his chair with his back to her but he isn\u2019t responding to her at all. She moves forward and realizes she is not being ignored, the Senator has been stabbed. She rushes to help him but she is too late. Things spiral out of control from there as people start to arrive and she has the murder weapon in her hands.I was really impressed with this very smart story. The author is a former Senate staffer so she is writing what she knows, less the murder, I hope. :)Kit works with her friend Meg and together they become this dynamic duo trying to find out who killed their very popular boss and if it had anything to do with an upcoming vote. This part really rang true for me. With the gridlock in Congress I am surprised there aren\u2019t more dead bodies. In this story there are plenty of people who could have killed the man. From his wife, to an important lobbyist, members of Congress and even his staff. They are so many twists that at one point I was completely confused, it could have been anyone, except Kit, of course. I figured it out right along with Kit, the way it\u2019s supposed to be.We leave Kit ready to start a new job and I hope it won\u2019t be too long until we hear all about it.

She felt very real to me. I\u2019m looking forward to learning more about her, and the rest of the characters from the series in future installments. From the discovery of the body, through pages and chapters of intrigue, to the action packed reveal and take down of the killer, I was totally engrossed in this stellar mystery!

I couldn't believe it was the author's first book. Everything about this book from the first chapter has you wanting more and not wanting it to end.The main character in the book, Kit is an up and coming staffer on Capital Hill. She is working her dream job with Senator Langsford, living with a wonderful man in a great condo with the cutest dog a beagle mix named Clarence. She believes in everything that the Senator stands for and has been with him since the beginning. Little does she know when she walks in his office on Tuesday morning that her life would change forever. She finds her beloved Senator with a stainless steel model military helicopter sticking out of his chest. Of course she thinks she maybe able to save him so she pulls it out. Now she has major issues because she is now holding the murder weapon and everyone thinks she killed him. She is now the main suspect and has every news agency reporting this with her picture on the front page. Now she has to explain all of this to her boyfriend Doug who's family is very connected and will not look kindly on her because of their reputation. As we all know gossip spreads like wildfire on Capital Hill. To try and douce the flames she starts investigating the murder along with her friend Meg. They come up with a list of suspects that will lead them all over Capital Hill. She finds allies that she didn't know she had in the people she has worked with for four years. Everyone wants to know why someone would want to kill the Senator. There are a lot of twists and turns in this book. You never know who to trust at any given time. Will Kit and her friends find the killer or killers before they strike again? What does a company called Carter Power play in his murder? Could all of this be about the oldest motive in the book, Money? Or is it something else know one will see coming? I hope their will be many more books in this series. I am not a person who enjoys political novels but this was a pleasant surprise. The mystery, adventure, suspense, and intrigue are not to be missed."}, {"userName": "Yvonne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/327853-yvonne", "userReview": "Senate Staffer, Kit Marshall arrives at work early to make sure her boss receives a memo she wrote. She\u2019s shocked when she finds her boss, Senator Langsford, murdered with his own model helicopter. Trying to help him, she touches the murder weapon and naturally becomes the prime murder suspect. In fact, according to the police, the only murder suspect. All other possibilities have ironclad alibis.To make matters worse, Kit\u2019s photo is all over the internet which doesn\u2019t sit well with her boyfriend\u2019s wealthy family. Not to mention that, with her boss dead, she\u2019s going to need a new job. That will be impossible to find under the circumstances. With the help of her best friend and fellow senate staffer, Meg, they start their own investigation into the murder. There\u2019s no way Kit can leave her life in the hands of the police.This book grabs you right from the start and holds your attention to the end. The author gives a great insight to the inner workings of Washington without overwhelming the reader with too many details. It\u2019s just the right amount to make readers feel as if they are part of the story.The characters come to life which isn\u2019t always an easy task when a series is first starting. I felt as if I already knew Kit and I liked what I read. Her boyfriend, Doug, seemed nice enough but I\u2019m hoping his character will be more developed in future books. Kit\u2019s friend, Meg, added a great spark to the story, she is full of energy and fun.The story itself is fast-paced and I enjoyed trying to figure out the killer along with Kit and Meg. I wasn\u2019t overly surprised at who it turned out to be, but there were several choices it could have been. So, it was a story that kept you guessing.Overall, a great start to a new series.

When it comes to pushing your own political agenda, one really doesn't want to be on the receiving end of some of those staffers and lobbyists, because the claws definitely come out. While in the real world, it's been quite some time since someone occupying a seat in the House of Representatives or the US Senate has been deliberately targeted and murdered -- Robert Kennedy, may he rest in peace -- it still doesn't take away the inherent danger of playing the game. However, it's far more often that a political misstep results in a loss of reelection, not of life. The way things have been going lately on Capitol Hill -- amongst the threat of government shut down and a looming presidential election -- it's not too hard to imagine someone taking a power trip far too seriously if things continue down this path.Longtime Senate staffer Kit Marshall has actually found herself in the midst of such a scenario. Just days before an important committee vote for a government energy contractor, her boss, Massachusetts Senator Lyndon Langsford, was found murdered in his office. Unfortunately for Kit, she was the one to come across the body and, as such, has found herself overwhelmed by the media circus as the lead suspect. Now that her career as a staffer has met an end almost as grisly as her former boss', it's up to her and her savvy friend Meg to determine who really killed Senator Langsford to clear her name. The thing is, nearly everyone around her has a motive for assisting the Senator in meeting his maker, but they all have an iron-clad alibi to back themselves up. In order to protect both her future and herself, Kit must figure out the real killer, or else she'll have to kiss her cushy way of life goodbye.Given that this was my first mystery since reading Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None in the seventh grade, I have to say that I definitely came into reading Stabbing in the Senate with an open mind. Anything in the mystery genre -- be it a movie, tv show, whatever -- usually bores me to tears. Granted, I wasn't expecting this book to be anywhere near the level of Christie's works, as she's considered to be a master of the genre for a reason, but I wasn't expecting to actually find myself pleasantly entertained by the book, either! Having lobbied in the past at my state Capitol (and rallied up at the actual Capitol), reading something that took place in a familiar arena made the experience that much more fun. I felt like all of the schmoozing and other goings on were quite accurate based on my short time as a lobbyist, which makes sense as Shogan is a former legislative staffer herself. As gruesome as Langsford's death was, it was fun to pretend to be a sleuth alongside Kit and Meg, as I found myself eager to make sure the mystery was solved for her sake. It was easy to like Kit's character because she felt like someone I could relate to: competent in a lot of areas, but not boastful about her abilities. I was actually able to figure out the murderer before Kit; that was fun to feel accomplished in that manner during the climax of the story. Kit also loves dogs, which is always a plus in my book for a character.However, there were quite a few snagging points for me in Stabbing in the Senate that held me back from getting overly excited about it. First and foremost, even though we heard a lot about Kit's personality -- which, again, is great! -- the audience never really gets a physical description of her. Granted, there's some hints about her wardrobe sprinkled here and there when it's relevant, but literally every other main character is described in such detail on a regular basis that I could probably hire a sketch artist to draw Meg, Kyle, Doug, Mandy, Vivian -- EVERYONE. But to skip over the main character's appearance altogether? Were we supposed to put ourselves into her shoes and see things from her eyes? Furthermore, I felt like there was a lot of information repeated over and over and over again to the point where it was quickly becoming a point of irritation for me. For example, in almost every scene in which Meg appeared, Kit goes into extreme detail about how much of a waif she is, how much men are attracted to her, her level of physical perfection. Whenever Kit's beagle, Clarence, was mentioned, we got a paragraph and a half about how much he was food-motivated, but it was pretty much the same explanations behind his food motivations every time. It's little things like that which made me feel a little bit like Shogan was condescending to her readers, as if within the span of two pages, we were going to forget these aspects of the characters.While I'm still slow to hop on board the mystery train, Stabbing in the Senate provided a fun, quick little trip through a city that I hold near and dear to my heart. I enjoyed solving the mystery alongside the sleuthing duo of Kit and Meg, even though I came to the conclusion that a certain character was the killer long before the girls did. However, there were certain areas in which I felt that Shogan was talking down to the reader a little bit; intentional or not, it's a bit of tone that could have been polished away during the editing phase. All in all, though, I have to say I'm intrigued by the start of the Washington Whodunit series; we've already killed off a Senator, so who's next?"}, {"userName": "OpenBookSociety.com ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3540731-openbooksociety-com", "userReview": "http://openbooksociety.com/article/st...Stabbing in the SenateWashington Whodunit, Book #1By Colleen J.

Shogan has written a wonderful whodunit and started what is bound to be a very entertaining new cozy mystery series. Stabbing in the Senate is a great first novel and a fun first in a series. Her writing style is enjoyable and easy. This is shorter than a lot of cozies, but packs a punch even so. Main character Kit Marshall is interesting and someone I would enjoy knowing. She is a staffer for D.C. Senator Langsford, a popular man on the hill that has taken a different course lately. He has been quite vocal about his changes in beliefs when it comes to voting. Especially an upcoming vote that could have huge repercussions. When Kit comes in to work a bit early to do some work, she finds her boss impaled by a model Army attack helicopter. Kit makes a big mistake as she pulls the murder weapon out hoping to give him first aid. Now her prints are on the murder weapon.Kit has a great cast of characters surrounding her. Best of course is her waif-like coworker/best friend Meg. There is also her food motivated beagle Clarence and her intelligent boyfriend Doug who is a trust fund baby, whose family is could trace their history back to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Her coworkers are interesting and diverse for sure. Some she thought were not friends, but are and some she thought were friends that aren\u2019t. Gossip on the Hill runs rampant and Kit has her face plastered in all the news. This is not going to be good for her job prospects. Kit and Meg decide they have to find the real killer before Kit is completely blackballed in politics. The two are a fun pair of friends and their exploits are entertaining.Full of political intrigue, high stakes decision makers, twists and turns and red herrings, Stabbing in the Senate is a wonderful new cozy. The characters are entertaining and the writing is spot on for a great whodunit. I am not really a fan of politics or D.C. in particular, but the way Colleen J. Shogan presented this story drew me in and kept me excited about it. I am sure fans of politics will love this new cozy series, but those like me that don\u2019t, will not be put off. The author somehow writes about the political word in a fresh and exciting style. Anyone that enjoys a well written classic whodunit, will love this book. It bodes well for a continuation of this series and I for one hope it does continue."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45018-pamela", "userReview": "Kit Marshall, is a D.C. staffer for the popular Senator Langsford.

And there\u2019s a murderer on the loose somewhere there!You\u2019ll enjoy exploring the world of Congress while the author leads you through the murder investigation to a surprising, satisfying conclusion."}, {"userName": "Angela Holland", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2340220-angela-holland", "userReview": "This book was a very good start to a new series. I really enjoyed this author's writing style. In fact I could not put this book down and read it in two days. You can tell that the author has used her experience as a Senate staffer to write this book. Her attention to detail was very good. I really liked Kit but I have to say that sometimes her friend Meg annoyed me. I can't wait to read more about their adventures in the upcoming books in this series. As well as I would like to see how Kit and Doug's relationship plays out. I am not sure I could work in the senate as it sure sounds like a dog eat dog kind of world. I did not figure out who killed Senator Langsford until the end of the story, which I like as it keeps you reading. Looking forward to more books in this series."}, {"userName": "Kate Donnelly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2773292-kate-donnelly", "userReview": "Kit Marshall a staffer on the Hill is accused of killing a Senator.

It would have a strong story line and then often veer off with useless details or information. At times I felt like the characters were behaving like teenagers.

I really enjoyed this book. Politics, a murder mystery, local Washington DC color . . . . It is well written and I absolutely loved my inability to solve the murder before the end of the story!

Seeing events from an insider's perspective was quite interesting to me. I love reading a mystery and learning at the same time. Thank you, Colleen Shogun."}], "description": "Life is good for Kit Marshall. She's a staffer in D.C. for a popular senator, and she lives with an adoring beagle and a brainy boyfriend with a trust fund. Then, one morning, Kit arrives at the office early and finds her boss, Senator Langsford, impaled by a stainless steel replica of an Army attack helicopter. Panicked, she pulls the weapon out of his chest and instantly becomes the prime suspect in his murder.Circumstances back Kit's claim of innocence, but her photograph has gone viral, and the heat won't be off until the killer is found. Well-loved though the senator was, suspects abound. Langsford had begun to vote with his conscience, which meant he was often at odds with his party. Not only had the senator decided to quash the ambitions of a major military contractor, but his likely successor is a congressman he trounced in the last election. Then there's the suspiciously dry-eyed Widow Langsford.Kit's tabloid infamy horrifies her boyfriend's upper-crust family, and it could destroy her career. However, she and her free-spirited friend Meg have a more pressing reason to play sleuth. The police are clueless in more ways than one, and Kit worries that the next task on the killer's agenda will be to end her life.Book 1 in the Washington Whodunit mystery series.", "title": "Stabbing in the Senate\n      \n          (Washington Whodunit #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25775813-stabbing-in-the-senate", "average": 3.96, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1437858902l/25775813.jpg", "reviews": 32, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1269678.Colleen_J_Shogan", "name": "Colleen  J.
