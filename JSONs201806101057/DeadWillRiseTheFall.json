I would almost say this book felt played out--maybe he's written too many of these and it's become rote? Not sure, but I enjoyed the first one more than this sequel. Though to be fair, unlike the first one, rape isn't really the central threat like the first book, so that was refreshing--instead, in this one, the evil government kills everyone, men, women, and children, to strip the resources to take back to the politicians hiding in the bunkers in Texas. Now, that's actually a NEW plot point which I haven't come across after so many zombie books, but that plot was fumbled (mentioned like once, not really brought up again--they didn't even interrogate the captives!!). Really, I now want to read a book where the beleaguered survivors have to fend off Ted Cruz's scout parties.Perhaps the first person of Kell, former prodigy, genius scientist partially responsible for the zombie plague (though if you spoke to him for 2 seconds, it would be all mea culpa for the whole damn thing), widower, and elite fighting 300 lb 6\"5 black man, should be semi phased out. If you look at the other main characters--the two women he rescued in the 1st book--you can't really differentiate between the 2 whatsoever (they even married brothers), and even the new woman who rescues him in this one, could almost be a stand in for them (except she has 2 tots). He mentions names and people, but there's almost zero description, which is odd, and started to a wear on me a bit. Rather than matter of fact Kell statements, I wanted description.  I think the sameness of voice, not much character building other than the main, and a rush to get on with the plot really hurt this. It would have been cool to see things from the vantage of the scouts or even the people back in Haven (which pretty obvious in reading this ties in with his other series), but it's always back to him feeling guilty because he worked on the strain. The terrible formatting in my copy didn't help. The book was basically one huge paragraph, which didn't really help readability."}, {"userName": "Rhonda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24217183-rhonda", "userReview": "I have no idea why I'm giving this book a 4, since I don't believe it rates a 4, more like a 3.5. I learned to really like the first book, but I just could never get into this one. One word I would use that describes this story quite consistently is \"boring.\"I also feel as if the author and I are on two different waves of thought. Somehow, we don't sync up, and that's sad cause I really want to know what will happen in the future, but I've decided to quit the series now--not because I'm afraid of the zombies, but because I'm afraid of wasted time.I'm going to try \"Next\" next, and hopefully that one will a book that I love."}, {"userName": "john heller", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26430677-john-heller", "userReview": "Great new authorfirst let me start by saying I love the \"zombie/post apocalyptic\" genre. I read the books simply for enjoyment. I try not to get overly excited about a new series our author, as I am usually disappointed. not with this series. I am truly enjoying the style and the ability of the author to build the characters. I recommend the series just because it's a different take on the hero. and no I'm not going to elaborate since that would spoil it if you haven't read the first book."}, {"userName": "Lee Atherton", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49147758-lee-atherton", "userReview": "Excellent, enthralling, entertaining and exciting !Dead will rise (is a good description of how I felt the morning after staying up all night to finish it ) !The 1st book in this series was good but this has taken the story to another level for me. Plenty of new characters, a few of whom you care about almost immediately after meeting them. Can't wait to see how the story develops now because no doubt about it, I'm hooked and will be with Kell and the 'girls' to the end."}, {"userName": "Joan Barstad", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27162372-joan-barstad", "userReview": "This is a very good series.

Probably what keeps me very on edge is the factor that the virus allows the dead to evolve and adapt in their pursuit of \"dinner.\" A great zombie saga for the lover of apocalyptic dystopia.

Unfortunately the third one is not written yet and I really really hate that. I broke my own rule not to begin a series until it has been completed.But it was worth it. I love the strong females in this story even though Kell himself is a gargantuan man. He is tall, big, strong, black and a scientist. He lost his wife and daughter in the Fall and the creation of the virus that killed them and most everyone else was made from the virus he created. So he is filled with tons of guilt. He hides his identity from everyone and goes by \"K\" because he believes if people find out who he really is they will kill him. He is best friends with the two women he saved from marauders and because of what happened to them they have become very strong. Although there is no romance with these ladies he does meet someone new and maybe maybe? there is a chance for romance with her.In this second entry in this series Kell and his friends leave the relative safety of their community and finally agree to go to the lab Kell had done his research in. They have some women and men guarding them as they go. Kell's struggles continue and excite and capture you as you go with him. His life is constantly in danger it seems, and you wonder how he will escape it this time. This is written in the same universe as Living With the Dead, although you do not need to read that first or after to understand this story. It is great on its own and although I read LWtD a year ago or so it has been so long it is like I did not read it yet I love this story. So if you are a fan of the zombie apocalypse as I am, this story is for you, for sure."}, {"userName": "Krisaundra", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3956934-krisaundra", "userReview": "Sad,,, :(I think my title really does best sum up my overall emotions regarding this book, the sequel to an absolutely amazing book. The first book allowed the reader to get a great deal of insight into Kell, (and others such as Lucy, Kate, Andrea, Micelle, Evan, etc) especially as he \"evolved\" for lack of a better term, to survive in this new, violent world where nothing he had grown up believing had prepared him for the new one. Growing with them was a huge part of why I loved the first book!This book, in my opinion, almost seemed to distance the characters causing me to struggle between a rating of 3.5 or 4 stars. Obviously I went with 4 but I think part of that is sentimentality for how deeply I enjoyed the first book and felt almost as if I'd actually met the characters and wanted to give them their due respect despite their gaping absence from this story. For example I believe there may be one mention of Michelle and Evan, at most, in the entire book! How were they coping? We're the initial bonds created between the kids and Kell still as strong? More expansion regarding what happened to Kate was expected but never occurred... There was tons of military info and strategy planning, but for me that wasn't why I wanted to read this book. I felt disappointed that characters I had grown fond of and wanted to continue to learn about in their battle for survival, and my be even a cure, seemed to take second place to innumerable pages of military garble. I will be moving forward with the series but with a sadness that I have no idea how such well fleshed out, realistic feeling characters I'll have to leave behind with no sense of closure. :("}, {"userName": "RJ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4187755-rj", "userReview": "Kell, Kate and Laura along with their group of survivors called \"The Unit\" are on their way to Kentucky. Several other groups of survivors from North Jackson have been included on their trek. Braving zombies and marauders they make their way to their new home.

Kell, separated from the convoy, gets himself captured by a scouting team of a larger marauding group. Just as quickly he is rescued by a young lady who has managed to keep herself and her two young children hidden and safe for the past year.

If I was to label Mr. Guess' books dealing with zombies I would have to call them hyper realistic post apocalyptic survival adventure.  This story, along with the rest of the stories set in the LWTD universe are rich and intelligent, heartwarming and gruesome. Truly unique and entertaining. Lastly, I must add that if you read these books and watch the walking dead the reading will make you view the walking dead differently."}, {"userName": "Keri Salyers", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5982754-keri-salyers", "userReview": "The way Kell had gone about observing the ways of the zombies- how they act and react- coupled with his strength of observation and overall smarts is appealing in many ways. Some will like how he was the top scientist studying the virus before it got out, how he wants to right that wrong. Others will be drawn to his resourcefulness, his lone wolf mentality even when surrounded by those people he wants to keep safe.And I like the zombie virus in this. The way it keeps adapting really ramps up the danger factor.You like zombies, you'll like this series.

Those looking for the typical zombie story won't find it here. It's more about a man's journey within the zombie apocalypse than it is about zombies. Sometimes I wish there were more zombies. In a world decimated by the zombie virus, one would expect to encounter more infected persons. As I also stated in my book one review, I'm waiting (still) for Dr. K to get back to work.
