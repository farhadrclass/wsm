I wouldn't have finished Ha\u0161ek's story had it not been for the Sadlon translation. His translation was illuminating, where Parrot's was not. Additionally, updating it into modern English, made it a significantly smoother read to boot.In the final analysis, this book is alternately funny and wrenching - if you take the time to think about the things these men are going through, and what they're subjected to. While the story never makes it into frontline combat, there's still plenty here to chew on about a nation thrust into a war they don't have much of a genuine emotional stake in. It was a fascinating look at Central Europe - and exposes an earthy, humorous culture - because \"Svejk\" is as much a story of the Czech people as it is about the titular character. (And, it's an incredibly rich tapestry of stories in here about the Czech people. In fact, tonight as I was driving home, I noticed a car in front of me with a bumper sticker that read, \"Team Irish Literature\", to which I muttered \"Baby. You ain't got nothing on the Czechs.\")At times this book felt unnecessarily drawn out, but you have to take it in stride, because (from what I understand), it was written episodically. I don't think the author meant for it to have a tightly drawn plot. It's just the story of a man on his way to war. A funny story, mind you. There were moments where I laughed out loud, chuckled, and it became a running joke with my Wife and I, that I would start to explain Svejk's exploits and she would groan and roll her eyes, with much the same exasperation that the long suffering Senior Lieutenant Luk\u00e1\u0161 greeted every long-winded anecdote delivered at the drop of a hat by the great Private Svejk...God, I wish I had Svejk's ability to talk myself out of a jam...Only now at the end, can I see where the comparison's to Catch-22 come from. \"Svejk\" is indeed about the absurdity of war, to the Nth degree. I've been with this character for a few years now. I started the Parrot translation roughly 3 years ago, and crapped out 60% of the way through. Slowly though, I found myself picking the book up on occasion, to the point which I said, \"I should really finish this.\" I stumbled on the Sadlon translation through his website which catalogs all sorts of Svejk ephemera from the current manifestations of Svejk's cultural legacy (how many literary characters have bronze statues dotting their country, and surrounding neighbors?), to intensive academic essays. I tried a sample of the new translation and was so stunned even by the difference in the meaning of the dialogue of the opening scene, I embarked on the story again from page 1. Well. Adieu Svejk. I'd toast your passing with a good Czech beer, except you can't get any here. (\"Budvar/Czechvar\" doesn't travel well from Central Europe out here to the Rust Belt...) It's been a great ride, and I'll miss the image of his beatific face in my mind's eye. This is truly an epic novel, and if you enjoy war satire, I heartily recommend it."}, {"userName": "James Klagge", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2715247-james-klagge", "userReview": "I was an editorial consultant on this new English translation. Thus I read it--with a microscope, multiple times--before it was published. Not as smooth as, but more faithful and interesting than, the standard Parrott translation.No doubt Jaroslav Hasek\u2019s favorite way to pass the time was to sit in a pub drinking beer and talking with friends. So it was with his character Josef Svejk. I had the unsurpassed pleasure in 2004 of sitting in the Czech Crown Inn of Lipnice, where Hasek wrote the closing books about Svejk, talking over mugs of beer with Hasek\u2019s great-grandson Martin, and later meeting his great-granddaughter Petra. Visit Lipnice if you get the chance, where the Hasek family now owns that inn."}, {"userName": "Nick Klagge", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2704424-nick-klagge", "userReview": "OK, I've been putting off this review long enough. I worked my way through all four books (three volumes) of Sadlon's translation of this classic of Czech literature, and though it may make me a bad Czech, I felt pretty neutral about it. Much like Tristram Shandy, and to some extent Don Quixote, the book is more or less a piling-up of marginally related stories, \"just one damn thing after another.\" The novel is unfinished--Hasek died while writing it--but because of this fundamental characteristic, I don't think it matters that much. I doubt Hasek had a satisfying conclusion in mind that died along with him. The novel contains very little in the way of character development. Svejk doesn't really change over the course of the book, although his character is complex enough that I do think you continue \"getting to know him\" a fair amount at least into Book Two. But he remains something of a cipher. He's clearly an active and enthusiastic shirker, and uses his \"certified idiocy\" to the fullest advantage. He is an anarchist in spirit, like his creator, with little time for the absurdities of church and state, but is not political about it. He is a frequent spinner of yarns, but it was never clear to me whether he really took pleasure in it, did it compulsively, or used it as a diversionary tactic. I suppose it is a combination of all three. He's not a totally likable character; he has a definite vindictive streak and is impulsive. But at the end of the novel, I still didn't really feel I had a sense of Svejk as a person; what motivates him, what he would be doing if he wasn't drafted, etc. He came across to me as more of a symbol than an individual. It doesn't seem like this is particularly of interest to Hasek as a writer; none of the other characters in the book are rounded or develop over time either, and Svejk doesn't have any complex relationships. (His relationship with his commander Lukas does span the full novel, and is charming at times, but it doesn't come across to me as very deep.) I guess in summary, Svejk is basically a negative presence, kind of a Bartleby--you know what he is against but not really what he is for. This seems to me the biggest contrast with Quixote, who clearly has a positive (if deluded) vision of the world, and is much more relatable for that reason.Perhaps it shouldn't be surprising that a national symbol for a people who have generally been ground under one or another heel is of this type. One thing I will say in the novel's favor is that I think it is very valuable to have a protagonist in a military story who is cowardly and, more or less, a deserter. I think this can often be the most honorable or moral way to respond to a military situation, but it is virtually never portrayed as such in literature or other pop culture. It is interesting to me that Finn, one of the leads of the new Star Wars film, is such a character. (Also of note, in Potsdam, Germany, there is a memorial to the Unknown Deserter, dedicated to \"a man who refused to kill his fellow men.\") This alone is a significant contribution, and is fitting that the character was created by the anarchist Hasek. Addendum: Although I have never read it, Catch-22 probably deserves a mention in the discussion of this last issue."}, {"userName": "MajinFox", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4396106-majinfox", "userReview": "OPINIA Z 10 SIERPNIA 20121 listopada 2012 zacz\u0105\u0142em czyta\u0107 pierwsze dwa tomy Szwejka, kt\u00f3re sko\u0144czy\u0142em po bardzo d\u0142ugim czasie 24 grudnia tego samego roku. Je\u015bli chodzi o moje szczeg\u00f3\u0142owe zapami\u0119tywanie dat, to jest to pewien fetysz, lubi\u0119 sobie wspomina\u0107, co i kiedy danego dnia czyta\u0142em. Cz\u0119sto nawet dzie\u0144 ko\u0144czenia tytu\u0142u nie jest przypadkowy, a z premedytacj\u0105 wyd\u0142u\u017cony, by by\u0142 bardziej \"okr\u0105g\u0142y\" lub \"uroczy\u015bciejszy\". Data rozpocz\u0119cia i uko\u0144czenia ksi\u0105\u017cki, to dwa wyj\u0105tkowe dni w poprzednim roku. Z tego powodu postanowi\u0142em na dzie\u0144 31 lipca sko\u0144czy\u0107 trzeci i czwarty tom Szwejka. Sp\u00f3\u017ani\u0142em si\u0119 o dziewi\u0119\u0107 dni, z czego jestem bardzo niezadowolony. Ale o ksi\u0105\u017cce to ma by\u0107 rozprawka, a nie o moich zboczeniach.Lekko zmusi\u0142em si\u0119 do sko\u0144czenia przyg\u00f3d Szwejka, ale podobnie, jak z \"Atlasem zbuntowanym\" nie dawa\u0142 mi spokoju dra\u0144 jeden. Przysiad\u0142em i okaza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce trzeci i czwarty tom jest o wiele zabawniejszy ni\u017c pierwsze dwa. Pow\u00f3d? Wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce wszystko to za sprawk\u0105 rozdzielenia historii na wi\u0119ksz\u0105 ilo\u015b\u0107 os\u00f3b. Wiele ciekawych postaci przewija si\u0119 przez histori\u0119, o wiele bardziej krety\u0144skich, ni\u017c g\u0142\u00f3wny bohater. O w\u0142a\u015bnie! Idiotyzm.W trakcie czytania postanowi\u0142em sobie przypomnie\u0107 pocz\u0105tek historii wojaczki Szwejka i obejrza\u0142em film z 1956 roku \"Dobry wojak Szwejk\" z Rudolfem Hrusinskym. Com zobaczy\u0142! Ju\u017c wiem sk\u0105d Szwejk jest idiot\u0105! Gdy nie mia\u0142em okazji wcze\u015bniej widzie\u0107 filmu, zastanawia\u0142em si\u0119, jakim cudem wszyscy uwa\u017caj\u0105 J\u00f3zefa za totalnego kretyna? Zawsze wydawa\u0142 mi si\u0119 chytrusem, kt\u00f3ry nabiera na sw\u00f3j iloraz inteligencji generalicj\u0119. Film sugerowa\u0142 dobitnie, \u017ce Szwejk to idiota bez dw\u00f3ch zda\u0144. Ciesz\u0105c si\u0119, \u017ce obali\u0142em mit, czyta\u0142em dalej ksi\u0105\u017ckowego J\u00f3zefa i widzia\u0142em w nim spryciarza. A\u017c do momentu, kiedy nie za\u0142o\u017cy\u0142 rosyjskiego munduru... Co za idiota!Historia ko\u0144czy si\u0119 tragicznie. Ostatnie zdanie: \"Na tym urywa si\u0119 r\u0119kopis Jaros\u0142awa Haszka\", pokazuje, \u017ce \u017cartownisiem jest si\u0119 tylko do pewnego momentu. I szczerze powiedziawszy szkoda, \u017ce tak daleko r\u0119kopis si\u0119ga, bo gdyby skr\u00f3cono go o jeden rozdzia\u0142, wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce sko\u0144czy\u0142 by si\u0119, hmmm.... pe\u0142niej.http://www.majinfox.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Tereza Fukov\u00e1", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3860006-tereza-fukov", "userReview": "V\u0161echny 4 d\u00edly se moc dob\u0159e \u010detly, je \u0161koda, \u017ee Ha\u0161ek nestihl d\u00edlo dokon\u010dit.Je to takov\u00e9 mil\u00e9, ale ned\u00e1 se souhlasit s t\u00edm, \u017ee \u010cechov\u00e9 by byli n\u00e1rod \u0160vejk\u016f, to bychom museli b\u00fdt v\u0161ichni retardovan\u00ed."}], "description": "This is the last volume of the The Fateful Adventures Of The Good Soldier vejk During The World War containing Book Three and Book Four.
