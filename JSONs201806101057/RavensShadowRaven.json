I loved this story. I must admit that there were parts that were slower and harder to read, and that's due to the intricacies of the worldbuilding (keep in mind, I don't read a lot of heavy-duty, traditional heroic fantasy--so keep the urge to sneer under wraps if you've read a lot of that and consider this book child's play). Having said that, I thought the idea of the different orders of magic really interesting. I loved how it all tied together and related very personally to Seraph, and the family she had with Tier. And, I like that she kept the story focused on the characters and their journey, and not on the actual magical aspects. The magic was part of who they were, and it affected the non-magic people who lived in the world of this book. I liked the messages about prejudice, and how some people are dismissed and marginalized, but they are the people who are capable of really doing something worthwhile in the world.Seraph is not the type of heroine who's in touch with her feelings and bright and bouncy, emotionally open. I didn't mind that. I liked that she was a to-the-point, contained, composed, but deeply feeling person. Because of the dangerous nature of her magic, she had to keep her composure. And it was clear that she did care about others, and loved her children and her husband, Tier, very deeply.Tier was a great hero. I loved him from the first page. He's so humane. Even years as a soldier, seeing the worst, didn't change that about him. He's a born leader, not through brute force, but an intrinsic charisma and his being a good person that you wanted to like. For all that, he's formidable and strong. He's the kind of hero I go ga-ga over.Tier and Seraph had good chemistry. Even though this isn't a romance novel, they have a great love, and I was hoping that things would work out for each other. After twenty years, there was still passion, and they knew each other so well, and cared for each other. Their love was a steadfast thing that empowered them, even if they didn't say the words to each other.Tier and Seraph's kids: Jes, Lehr, and Rinnie, all play important roles. I loved all of them. But my favorite, hands down, was Jes. He managed to be menacing and dangerous (in a very appealing way), but sweet, at the same time. His gift (also could be a curse) was very fascinating to me. I was hoping that we'd see a lot of him. And I liked the fact that he found a connection with a woman who wasn't scared of him, like so many others were. Jes, Lehr and Rinnie's gifts really came in handy in this story. It was interesting to see how they came to realize what they were, and how they embraced them. Although, they struggled with their natures as magically-gifted people. Raven's Shadow may not appeal to some fans of the Mercy Thompson books. It's pure fantasy. But, the things that I love about Patricia Briggs' writing are there for me to enjoy. Her writing has a simple, yet elegant beauty. She tells a story that is full of the human element. When I read her stories, I get so captivated in seeing how her characters unfold, and how they meet the issues that life gives them. This book was no different. I like how she gives you characters that have flaws and troubles, and you end up getting heavily invested in their stories, hoping for the best for them. And, she's so good at writing about magic, and a good adventure yarn, to go with it.When I was a kid, I devoured all the fantasy I could find in the library. But I fell out of reading fantasy for a long time. I've recently gotten back into reading it. This was a good start. It's focused on the characters, but it has the traditional heroic fantasy elements. And in Patricia Briggs' hands, it's very successful. I'd say give it a try, if you like the Mercy Thompson books. If things seem to move slowly at times, hang in there. I think you'll enjoy the end efforts. Or, at least I did. I look forward to reading Raven's Strike, the next book in this set."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13954899-kathleen", "userReview": "This series is engrossing and heartwarming \u2014 featuring middle-aged Seraph and Tier, and their three adorable \"gifted\" kids. A good duology for teens and adults who like character-driven fantasy. Not urban fantasy. More like old-world fantasy. One heartwarming family of farmers and their friends take on The Path and The Shadowed, an \u00fcber-evil human who feeds on pain and death. It's told in 3rd person, and beautifully narrated by Jennifer James Bradshaw.Main protagonists: A family of farmers with secret gifts. They are the bird-named Travelers (gifted with special abilities by the two gods, the destroying Stalker and the creating Weaver). Family members: Seraph a mage (Raven) married to Tier the Owl, about ten years older than her, having served 9 years in the imperial army, he's a lie-detector bard with gifts of music, memory, and charisma. Their eldest son Jes, age 20, the guardian (Eagle, an empathic warrior who shape-shifts into a wolf, jaguar, etc.), second son Lehr, age 17, the Falcon and 10-year-old daughter Rinnie, the Cormorant. Then there is another Raven mage who joins the family to defeat the enemy \u2014 Henayah (sp?). Her story unfolds slowly across both books.There is also an emperor, young, spoiled, and bored, but growing in courage and wisdom every day (I loved how Briggs developed Phoran, the 27th emperor). A forgetful beautiful Raven, an old healer named Brewydd, a courageous prostitute, a horse named Skew, a dog named Gurrah, and a few good men, young and old. Good gender and age range.Contents: No sex scenes. Little or no swearing, if any. Some violence and black magic, but not excessive, and it didn't feel too scary or too realistically painful. It's mostly wizardly fantasy, but there are two sweet romantic relationships. Nothing graphic or explicit.My only quibbles are minor and spoilers, so I will just say the beginning was a bit choppy in terms of POV shift, and it felt slow once or twice, when Briggs lost the feel of the storyline by explaining how the magic worked. It starts a little slowly, too. The sequel is even better than this one.I think this series is one of Briggs's best. What a happy surprise. It beats the Mercy series in terms of plot cohesion, characterization, and originality, even though I love Mercy, Adam, et al. I also read the sequel, Raven's Strike. So good! I love these characters! How about writing another, please! Same characters!Superb narration by Jennifer James Bradshaw. I place her in my top tier of narrators. Wow!"}, {"userName": "Bry", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1360862-bry", "userReview": "I loved the overall plot and the intricacies of the magic of the Travelers and the solsenti or regular humans. There were so many abilities, and various ways of doing magic. It was all extremely interesting and well thought out. I also loved Tier and the children's characters. They were all so loyal, protective, kind, and good that it was just heartwarming. Seraph took me a lot longer to like due to her coldness which was necessary to keep her magic in check, but thankfully she found a way to shoulder her magic and allow herself emotions. So in the end I just adored their entire family. Also, the character of the Emperor who started out as an annoyance proved himself and his worth by the end. I can see him becoming a great figure in their world and their history. My issues with the book was the pacing, which is hard to understand as the plot seemed to unveil itself and it's mysteries at a continuous rate. Yet there were several times when I felt it was just moving along too slowly. My other issue with this book was the relationship between Tier and Seraph. In over 20 years of marriage they never told one another that they loved the other. And it's not as if they didn't until all of these hardships forced them to reevaluate their feelings. They both have loved one another for the majority of the marriage but it was never said. This just seems like something that should have come up much sooner than now regardless of her Travelers upbringing. His humor, teasing, and general mirth should have made it an issue. Either way, Patricia Briggs just gives readers another reason to see how great of a writer she is. Her stories are detailed in their plots, smooth in their style, and seamless in their construction. By the end I really enjoyed the book, which is sometimes hard for me since I rarely read pure fantasy books. I truly enjoy her style and will definitely be reading the 2nd book in the duology, Raven's Strike."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/264832-julie", "userReview": "Halfway through, I'm surprised by this book. It felt like it was going to head one direction, then it fooled me and went another direction entirely. I'm glad, since the first direction wasn't the way I wanted to head.This is only the second series I've read by Briggs. Like her Mercy Thompson books, this has some wonderful characterization and very smooth writing.

I just figured it would be Mercy Thompson with no electricity. I don't know why I doubted Brigg's ability to write both Paranormal and a more true Fantasy, but I did doubt. And she proved me wrong! The world building here was very well done. Enough was explained in the beginning to satisfy me, and then more was slowly revealed. It was well written and I can't wait to read the next book.My only complaint is something that I have noticed in the Mercy books as well. There is a lot of build up to the final conflict, but the final conflict itself is over in little more than a page.

It turned out to be quite different. There were a lot of unexpected little twists and turns. I think some aspects of the plot could have been more fully explained, but that might have slowed down the story. It was nice to have a story with a family full of characters, rather than a single main character seeking his/her fortune. The number of characters left me wanting a more focused story on each one, but overall I think they interacted well and the author balanced them against each other nicely."}, {"userName": "Hybrid Creature (devours books instead of brains)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23809381-hybrid-creature-devours-books-instead-of-brains", "userReview": "The Travelers are a lot like gypsies although some of them have mage-like powers. They destroyed their home city to save the world from the ultimate evil and now wander the lands fighting lesser evil as they come across it. Of course, people not of their kind don't understand them. And what do humans love to do with something they don't understand? They try to destroy it. It's working. The Traveler's numbers are few and a new evil is rising.Tier was a soldier on his way home from war when he came across a young Traveler girl being sold to the highest bidder. Not liking the looks of the men trying to buy her, Tier out bid them all. Seraph is the last of her clan after a sickness swept through and killed all of her family. Her brother dies before her eyes and the next thing she knows, the innkeeper is selling her to cover the costs of her stay. At a time like this, all she wants to do is out run the life set before her.Fast forward twenty years later. Tier and Seraph have been hiding in the mountains, farming, raising a family and trying to avoid the fates set before them. The thing about destiny is, it doesn't just give up when you run from it.A new religion is rising and they are sacrificing Travelers and stealing their powers. This same new order kidnaps Tier and threatens Seraph children and you do not threaten the ones Seraph loves.One of the things that made me love this book, besides the great world-building and characterization, is that it is a family fighting evil. It avoids the overdone troupe of the lone underdog taking on evil. The one thing I did not like was the conveniently easy battle against their enemies, neatly wrapped up at the end. Despite this it was still a good ending and I will definitely continue with the series."}, {"userName": "Issam", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2605271-issam", "userReview": "This was given to me from a friend, and was my first Patricia Briggs novel. Before beginning, I had assumed that the universe that had been set up in here would be overly complicated and tied at length through several other books, but it wasn't, and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to fall into the story, the characters, and the magical world of wizards, travelers, strange creatures, and the Ordered that Patrica Briggs had so believably, and creatively, embedded here in a realistic way. I was hooked from the first chapter!\"Raven's Shadow\" was overall an excellent read, fairly unpredictable, with quite a few twists that I enjoyed, as they shifted the novel from where I thought it was going. Also, it was great to finally read a tale that not only fully featured a hero and heroine, but their family as well (except Alinath, she can go to hell). The kids were an important and welcoming addition to the storyline, and as interesting characters as well, which is something I'm not quite so used to seeing in many novels.A definite, definite recommend from me to anyone else who enjoys fantasy and well written, thoughtful characters in general. Easily one of the best fantasy books I've read in a long while, and you can be sure that I'm going to be reading the next part, as well as the rest of her books. Patricia Briggs has easily become my new favourite author after \"Raven's Shadow\"."}, {"userName": "Anita", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/940248-anita", "userReview": "I read 90 pages of this and gave up. I went to a Patricia Briggs book signing recently and she made fun of some of her early writings, saying \"They really will publish anything,\" and now I get what she meant. It's not that the story is bad, it's just that the writing is not one-tenth as tight as Ms. Briggs current works. I can't explain it, but somehow I just don't care much about what happens next. This is a traditional fantasy set in a world where magic is known and sometimes feared. Seraph, of the magical Traveler race and a powerful mage, is rescued by Tier, an ex-soldier, and ends up married to him with three kids. Travelers have a sacred duty to keep the evil Stalker's powers in check by hunting down its agents, but Seraph turns from that to live a simpler life.

I am constantly amazed at her characters and the relationships they have with each other. Briggs has a great, healthy perspective on individuality, love, family, and romance. Because her characters don't fit into the traditional fantasy mold, her plots can't be predictable. Have you ever read another book where the hero/heroine takes their whole family along for the adventure and each person's skills are necessary for the resolution? The cast of fully-developed characters drive the story to places and situations no plot has gone before. This book and its sequel gave me a fresh perspective when I was jaded to the genre.

And yet, somehow all these old, tired pieces combine to form something just different enough to be enjoyable. Not astoundingly, brilliantly different (see: Brandon Sanderson) but comfortably individual. Like a dilapidated armchair that has been re-stuffed and re-covered: familiar, yet still with a certain newness to it.For one thing, although the first chapter might lead you to believe this is a tale of the good-hearted hero winning the heart of the feisty ice-maiden, it\u2019s not. The cover might also be misleading you in this direction; it looks like a paranormal romance between a richly-robed sorceress and her shape-shifting lover. This is unfortunate, as the woman on the cover is most likely the (close to 40-years-old for most of the book) mage Seraph, and the animal featured beside her is probably her adult son, Jes. Raven\u2019s Shadow is very much a family affair, featuring Tier, ex-soldier, farmer, bard; his wife Seraph, Traveller and mage; their sons Jes and Lehr, both nearly adults; and their daughter Rinnie, still a child. When Tier goes missing, it will take all of them to help save the day.This is a cozy little fantasy, and although it\u2019s book one of a duology, it stands alone reasonably well. The charm of it lies not so much in the worldbuilding (uncomplicated) or plot (straightforward) or villain (underdeveloped) but in the characters: multiple, complex, all with different and often conflicting goals and motivations. It\u2019s a relatively short read (for a fantasy novel i.e. not an unwieldy brick) and I recommend it to any fantasy lover looking for a light, pleasant read."}, {"userName": "Blodeuedd Finland", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1962503-blodeuedd-finland", "userReview": "I like the fact that this fantasy had a mature heroine.

Seraph and Tier gets married and 20 years later the real story starts.A mature heroine with 3 kids, and a missing husband. Seraph was strong, and I liked her. Tier too, he was all nice. The kind you just want to hug.I did get angry at all silly peasants and alike. They do not like the travellers, but the travellers are trying to protect these ignorant idiots. But I liked that. There is always some people at the bottom of the pecking order. And it makes you wonder what will happen when all travellers have been killed.There was fantasy, magic and real life life too.

Around the middle, though, those issues dropped away and I was able to enjoy a wonderful story about a family caught up in events much larger than themselves.There are two problems with the beginning. First, we see Seraph and Tier before they're married and then take a 20 year jump in time where they have three kids and a struggling farm. That's a big jump and more than a little disconcerting. I would like to say that we didn't need that early part of the novel, but key parts of the story are established there and I'm not sure how those could be better communicated and they\u2019re crucial to the story so removing them wouldn\u2019t work, either. So I'm torn. On the one hand, it was off-putting. On the other, I don't know how it could have been done better.Second, Tier disappears early after that 20-year jump even though he's the only viewpoint we had up to that point. So we spend a bunch of time with Seraph and the kids trying to find out what happened and dealing with local persecution (Seraph was an outsider to begin with and now that Tier is gone, she has little local support and not a little local antagonism). Tier is supposed to be dead (a body was found), but there's enough \"off\" about it that you just know there's more to the story. It's not only a viewpoint jump, but we stick with Seraph and kids long enough that it feels like this is where the story is headed. And then at a critically tense moment with SaK \nwhammo\n we shift to a new perspective and then, finally we're back with Tier. I practically got whiplash at the shift and that took me completely out of the story.Once past that second (third?) big jump, things settled down much more reasonably. After that point, no new perspectives were introduced and the transitions are much less brutal. From there it was smooth sailing and I was able to enjoy what turns out to be an excellent story about magic, family, leadership, and responsibility.One reason those early jumps were so disconcerting is because I just liked Tier so much. He's a veteran looking to settle down, intimately familiar with the foibles of those around him, but willing to look at their potential as well. He's kind and forgiving and willing to work with whatever someone else is willing to give him. It was no surprise to me that he started subverting his captors almost before they'd finished locking him up. That he did so with deliberation and forethought (and was so effective at it) bore out my earlier attachment to him and was, frankly, fun to experience.I wasn't as attached to Seraph, but then, that's part of what makes her work as an interesting character. Her honest love and devotion for Tier was enough to attach my affections and her growth as she accepted her trials and overcame them was a great part of the climax of the book. You knew from the start that she could, and would, fight for her own but it was rewarding to see that she could, and would, negotiate, compromise, wheedle and cajole for it as well. That she turned out to be a competent leader was an unlooked for, but gratifying, development.Lastly, it was a pleasant surprise (given some of my last few books) for a book that is part of a duology to end so gracefully. There are no stupid cliff-hangers and no cheesy manipulation designed to make you impatient for the next novel. It would have been easy to end this book in a tense place and save the resolution for later. Kudos to Patricia Briggs for resisting that temptation."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/995136-lisa", "userReview": "I've read Patricia Briggs' urban fantasy/werewolf shtick and I like those ok. I'd have to sift through what bothers me about Mercy Thompson and Alpha and Omega - I think offhand I find Mercy's boy toy boring and wooden (not in a good way . . .) and Mercy is sort of scampy and defiant for no particular reason. Acting 16 when you're 26 isn't cute. Also Briggs urban fantasy feels predictable to me.Now, this book I really enjoyed. Reminds me of Patricia C. Wrede's high fantasy or maybe Mercedes Lackey. I think fans of Ilona Andrews might like this too. Lots of fantasy tropes galloping around but for me they sort of provided a comfortable background and framework for creating an interesting magical system, good characterization, and good plot development. Just really fun. I liked that the main characters were strong and smart but also vulnerable - not Mary Sues, not infallible, not unhurtable. I also really liked that the story centered around an established marriage and family unit rather than boy/girl gets/loses boy/girl drama which, while done a lot, has also been done to death. The kids were really fun too. A good universe in which there are actual costs and risks with power.

She has an easy style of writing that's well paced. Though this book is a little slower than her Mercy Thompson series, it still moves well enough that don't feel anything of a sort of drag. In fact, if anything I almost wanted this book to be a little longer to see a bit more world-building.Briggs writes good chemistry for the principals: Tier and Seraph. Both are strong in their own right, both have their own personalities that are different enough yet compliment each other. The development of their relationship proceeds believably as a result. Several of the secondary characters prove entertaining as well.If I have any complaint, it's that the antagonists don't have the same breadth of character as the protagonists. In some ways, they are a bit cartoonish, not a match for the protagonists. I'm making it to appear more than it is. It's really a small complaint, and I give this book four stars so it's obviously not a glaring flaw.Briggs has a lot of talent, and I'm glad I picked up one of her traditional fantasy novels.

She is a master weaver of strange/wondrous worlds and no one can script characters with such detail that they feel more like acquaintances than fiction. While I truly enjoyed Raven's Shadow, it was not my favorite of her novels. Don't get me wrong, the Raven's world and the characters were crafted with her usual beautiful style, this just wasn't 4 starts for me. I will go on to read Raven's Strike and the Dragon Bones series. However, before I ordered them I was hesitant because usually I do not enjoy series about dragons, witches and such (there are a few exceptions). However, I am so bored for something good to read and new installments of most of my favorite series won't be out for a while, I decided to go back to Ms. Briggs and try something new. I am not dissapointed and neither will you be if you read the book."}, {"userName": "Hilary", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3282620-hilary", "userReview": "The writing was a bit dry for my liking, creating distance between the characters and me, so I felt very little connection with any of them until I was almost at the end. I'd probably say this was my least favorite of Patricia Briggs' books. Some of that style can be seen in the Aralorn/Sianim series, but I actually cared about Aralorn and Wolf. Seraph and Tier were distant characters, like those family members you vaguely remember but only know by name versus the ones you seek out for visits."}, {"userName": "Nenya", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23987412-nenya", "userReview": "I read this some years ago and had only bits and pieces to google for it (5 birds, one of them was lark. i didn't remember raven till later. lol)It was amazing. Unfortunately, this book ends leaving the future open, which we get to see in the 2nd book. And the second book impressed me a little less :(. It was brilliantly written, with so many twists and turns. Just one too many I guess. There was one (or two?) relationship that I had issues with, not the main one, but a side couple (2nd book). Also, any plot that introduces torture and goes on to describe it, in YA, I don't care for it. Though it wasn't way over the top, I thought it was inappropriate."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4215134-angie", "userReview": "Mais pourquoi ai je attendu aussi longtemps avant de commencer ce roman ? Il est tout \u00e0 fait ce que je recherchais et dont j'avais besoin en ce moment : de la bonne fantasy \u00e0 l'ancienne comme j'en raffole.Perdue dans ses pages, j'ai m\u00eame oubli\u00e9 que j'\u00e9tais dans un Briggs dont je trouve le style nettement meilleur, la narration moins lourde ici que dans ses autres titres, avec des personnages particuli\u00e8rement int\u00e9ressants.

It\u2019s very different from \u201cMercy Thompson\u201d or \u201cAlpha and Omega\u201d; what similar is the way author develops her characters, their loving and believable personalities and well as their surrounding which is superb. Every time when you think that you know where the story is going there is twist and turn that keeps you hooked. There are parts of the book that quite slow, but like in most fantasy books it takes time to set up. Overall, it is a good read."}, {"userName": "Samantha wickedshizuku Tolleson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2237173-samantha-wickedshizuku-tolleson", "userReview": "I've had this book and the following book for some time just patiently sitting on my bookshelf. I think mostly I put off reading it is that I enjoy Briggs' work. I really do, but she very seldom writes in the High Fantasy genre. I want more books like this!I thought the entirety of this book was intriguing to the point of deserved obsession. The magic system was done well, and the characters were inquisitively designed. The plot was outstanding, and interesting."}, {"userName": "Barbara \u2605", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1968285-barbara", "userReview": "This one is pure fantasy and is totally different from her Mercy Thompson series.
