Even then I found myself confused, if not baffled by the alien action of the last 10% of the novel where those events are most intrusive.The sudden and aerially spectacular appearance by their lone and detested supervisor to this remote murder site, is baffling from the onset. The way this invasion proceeds to upstage the murder investigation and detract from the general genre of a very different book, is unfortunate.The precipitous and murderous decline of Jean-Guy at the end is unconvincing, too abrupt, if not contrived, even given the imported impetus (pills and DVD) by Francouer designed specifically to send him over the edge. I have held serious reservations regarding Jean-Guy as Gamache's choice of protege since the first book; they have so little in common culturally and educationally and he has an inferior deductive mind. But I found myself appalled by his embrace of this man as prospective son-in-law. If the non-addicted persona never seemed a good match for Gamache--the new recidivist addict version seems less so. The repeated face downs between Gamache and Francouer rapidly devolved into spitting contests with Gamache always on the verge of homicide, and Francouer always taunting him further. Enough already. How many times can you say 'stop that', slap his hands, and expect that to be an effective deterent? Lock him in a cell, hand-cuff him to an appliance,...take some action. On the other side of the argument, how many times does a subservient employee have to rough house you before you have grounds to simply fire him? All the kerfluffle at the end between a drugged and paranoiac Beauvoir and enraged Gamache/Francouer abusing each other literally over the altar, immediately proceeds the denouement where the murderer is cleverly if hastily exposed. IMO it destroys what up until then had been a carefully crafted, interesting monastery murder. It upstages and abbreviates what should have been the repercussions among the monks of outing the murderer and importantly the resolution of the schism that divided them. And so the importance of all the descriptors for this perfect music, the quiet untamed wildness, the rainbow play of light on stone, the allegory of the entwined wolves, the extraordinary diversity of the monks, the meticulous architecture of the monastery, the philosophical examination of monastic life, bliss, peace, ecstasy, the discovery and discoverer of the monastery's treasure, and the voice of God, and the apprehension of the murderer ...all these things are swept away in the furious, fast, final pages.This cachophonous ending is not what I would have envisioned for a book named for plainchant."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Rating: 4.75* of five The Publisher Says: The brilliant new novel in the New York Times bestselling series by Louise Penny,\u00a0one of the most acclaimed crime writers of our time.No outsiders are ever admitted to the monastery of Saint-Gilbert-Entre-les-Loups, hidden deep in the wilderness of Quebec, where two dozen cloistered monks live in peace and prayer. They grow vegetables, they tend chickens, they make chocolate. And they sing. Ironically, for a community that has taken a vow of silence, the monks have become world-famous for their glorious voices, raised in ancient chants whose effect on both singer and listener is so profound it is known as \u201cthe beautiful mystery.\u201dBut when the renowned choir director is murdered, the lock on the monastery\u2019s massive wooden door is drawn back to admit Chief Inspector Armand Gamache and Jean-Guy Beauvoir of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec. There they discover disquiet beneath the silence, discord in the apparent harmony. One of the brothers, in this life of\u00a0 prayer and contemplation, has been contemplating murder. As the peace of the monastery crumbles, Gamache is forced to confront some of his own demons, as well as those roaming the remote corridors. Before finding the killer, before restoring peace, the Chief must first consider the divine, the human, and the cracks in between. My Review: I've recently reviewed the thirteenth entry in a mystery series, which I have now abandoned; and another twelfth entry in a series, which I have not abandoned, despite its uneven track record in my affections.This is the eighth Gamache mystery. Louise Penny has ripped my emotions to shreds more than once before now. She's not a writer who has any fear of allowing her creations to grow and change, like real people do, in ways that might not always suit us, the audience.And that is the reason that her books don't simply keep selling. They rocket up the bestseller lists. They deserve to rocket up the bestseller lists because Louise Penny invests her characters with believable inner lives. I know the characters well, and like so many people I know well, they throw me curve balls and they change into people I don't like, and they screw up and they cannot help themselves because, like every breathing one of us, they are wounded and hurting and scared and doing their dead-level best to get through each day with a minimum of carnage.And when challenges arise, well...they rise to them or they fall before them, just like real people do. Like real people, their responses bring up feelings, strong ones, in us their friends...their readers...Louise Penny's readers. Strong, strong feelings. Quite strong. Oh my yes.A few minor points: I've heard it said that Penny's is a writing style that is choppy, or clipped; I agree with this assessment; and I for one find that a plus, because the stories themselves are so lush and so intense and would so lend themselves to a more baroque treatment that I find the clipped-ness of the prose to be refreshing and invigorating. I've also heard a few dissenting voices say somewhat dismissive things about the plots of the books, the puzzles themselves. With this critique I find myself out of sympathy. I unravel the mysteries quickly because I've read so very many over the years. I suspect some reviewers have the same experience level that I do. I would suggest to those readers that they consider the number of truly surprising resolutions they've read in the past few years that didn't involve authorial sleight-of-hand."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "I really enjoy this series but this was one that did not really enthral me. I like the books set in Three Pines best, largely because I have become very attached to all of Penny's wonderful characters.The Beautiful Mystery however is set totally in a monastery and the only characters we know for most of the book are Gamache himself and his off sider Jean Paul Beauvoir. Now I really do not like Beauvoir and find it very hard to understand why Gamache has so much time for him. In this book he sinks to new depths in his determination to ruin his own life and I found myself skimming whole chunks of his nonsense.A shame really because I absolutely loved the previous book.

What will I do with myself? I have so much enjoyed knowing a whole town involved in a murder mystery, as well as the detective and his team. Despite the initial trepidation this set off in my head, it was quickly allayed by the story that Louise Penny laid before me. This was really damned good. Even if it had a heartbreaking ending. Penny's understanding and portrayal of human nature in all its warts and beauties shines through every page.

How wrong could I possibly be?I knew as soon as I read two Goodread reviews on this book that I would love it. It has actually succeeded my wildest dreams. All the ingredients were there that have fascinated me since I was a child: monks, monasteries and Gregorian chants, with the added bonus of the setting in Qu\u00e9bec. The only other book in this genre that perhaps could indirectly be compared is \u201cThe Name of the Rose\u201d by Umberto Eco that I read many years ago.This is a mystery that indeed delivers. Initially I thought that the title was rather inane: \u201cThe Beautiful Mystery\u201d but that was soon explained.A monk is murdered in the monastery of Saint-Gilbert-Entre-les-Loups (between the wolves?), far away in the wilderness of Qu\u00e9bec, a closed order where twenty-four monks live in tranquillity and peace, with a vow of silence. They appear to be self-sufficient in that each monk has a \u201ctrade\u201d that he can call upon, be it working in the garden or taking care of the plumbing, etc. They also make chocolate mixed with blueberries. But they had all been \u201crecruited\u201d from other monasteries with another requirement that of having beautiful voices to sing the ancients chants. The beauty of these chants in fact so overwhelmed whoever heard them that they became known as \u201cthe beautiful mystery\u201d.How could anyone possibly know this, from this isolated monastery? This story\u2019s origins are based on the Inquisition which became a brutal time for monasteries. No-one was safe, some even going to the New World to escape persecution and torture. But then the Gilbertines (the monks who oddly enough wore black robes and white hoods) came up with a far better solution \u2013 they vanished. Then they were heard on the radio three hundred years later as they had decided to make a recording and thanks to the internet they were heard by millions. The Gregorian chants of the Gilbertines were exquisite and so they were finally discovered in Qu\u00e9bec. But although many came to visit them, no-one was allowed into the monastery.Then one day, the choir director, Brother Mathieu is found dead in the abbot\u2019s private garden that can only be accessed from Dom Philippe\u2019s own rooms. Then, whilst the victim is being examined by the monastery\u2019s doctor, a small piece of vellum falls from his sleeve; an intricate script that appears to be part of a page from an old manuscript, in Latin.As a result of this murder, Chief Inspector Armand Gamache and Jean-Guy Beauvoir are called in from the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec. With painstaking detective work, Armand succeeds in finding the murderer but at what price to him personally? For this is a man who has his own demons to deal with as does Beauvoir.The clues are all there but I was unable to find them. But when I arrived at the section when the \u201cdot\u201d was discovered I was in awe. There\u2019s such a strong sense of place in this mystery. The plot is indeed multi-faceted, as are the sub-plots.Music and songs permeate the text, with exquisite descriptions of both within and outside the monastery. One can even feel the anguish of the monks as Armand systematically interviews them.Then Gamache\u2019s boss, Chief Superintendent Sylvain Francoeur, appears. Rather evil, in fact the Devil incarnate and then\u2026.Elements of tragicomedy can be detected and in fact pages 358-359 are sublime. The reader may wonder why the Latin words that are sung translate to \u201cI have a banana in my ear\u201d. But due to this Armand manages to succeed here in flushing out the murderer.Sadly, I cannot really put into words the way I feel about this incredible work; nevertheless, what a glorious book with which to end 2015."}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "Historical theme:An ancient order, the Gilbertines, is occupying the monastery with a unique selection of monks singing an ancient collection of Gregorian chants as part of their Divine Office. Their power was not so established in their disciplined, isolated religious calling, as it was divided between their dedication to their music and their silence. In this impregnable wall of divinity and humanity a few cracks appeared. A silent war was raging, pushing a divide through the old institution and causing the foundations to crumble. The monks are facing each other in two lines, across the stone floor of the chapel, like ancient battle lines. Silently. Always silently.Plot:Chief Inspector Gamache and Jean-Guy Beauvoir, his assistant, of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, is called to investigate a murder in this isolated abbey. Sub-plot: The relationship between the two colleagues are tested on a much deeper level when they are removed from their own lives and established behind the thick walls of a monastery which has never seen any other human beings other than monks in its centuries-old existence.\n\"Armand Gamache had expected to need a few moments to adjust to the dark interior. He hadn\u2019t expected that he\u2019d need to adjust to the light. Far from being dim, the interior was luminous.A long wide corridor of gray stones opened up ahead of them, ending in a closed door at the far end. But what struck the Chief, what must have struck every man, every monk, who entered those doors for centuries, was the light.The corridor was filled with rainbows. Giddy prisms. Bouncing off the hard stone walls. Pooling on the slate floors. They shifted and merged and separated, as though alive.The Chief Inspector knew his mouth had dropped open, but he didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d never, in a life of seeing many astonishing things, seen anything quite like this. It was like walking into joy.He turned and caught the eye of the monk. And held it for a moment.There was no joy there. Just pain. The darkness Gamache had expected to find inside the monastery was not in the walls, but in the men.\"\nComments:Louise Penny has the magical ability to pull the reader into a new world from the very first sentence in her story. A sense of excitement and contentment roll over the reader like a drug fix. She never budges from her rendition of gentle realism, while still addressing series issues.Quebec is the background to her stories and she manages, by alternating the themes in this series, to highlight the history and beauty of her world. Every second book moves away from the readers' beloved fictional village, Three Pines, which, in the first place, showcases her ability to write any murder mystery successfully. Secondly, and that's my opinion, she considers her readers, by moving away from the established theme of the series, thereby adding new possibilities on a constant, and in a very successful way. This is the first book in the series that moves completely away from Three Pines. Throughout the series she develops Armand Gamache's character, adding more aspects of his complicated personality. There is never an indulgence into super-heroism. She never portrays him as a superior persona. He has demons of his own to confront before he can capture the killer. The incredible atmospheric background of this story is almost indescribable. No outsiders are ever admitted to the monastery of Saint-Gilbert-Entre-les-Loups, hidden deep in the wilderness of Quebec, where two dozen cloistered monks live in peace and prayer. They grow vegetables, they tend chickens, they make chocolate. And they sing. Ironically, for a community that has taken a vow of silence, the monks have become world-famous for their glorious voices, raised in ancient chants whose effect on both singer and listener is so profound it is known as \u201cthe beautiful mystery.\u201dThe origin of written music is revealed.

The murder of their prior and choirmaster, Fr\u00e8re Mathieu, has forced open their doors to Inspector Gamache and Jean-Guy Beauvoir of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9becPenny\u2019s writing is simply superb. Her prose is more than mere words telling a story, her phrases are stories in themselves. \u201cGamache couldn\u2019t yet see the blows that led up to the final, catastrophic crushing of this man\u2019s skull. But he\u2019d find them. This sort of thing never came out of the blue. There\u2019d be a trail of small wounds, bruises, hurt feelings, insults and exclusions.\u201d  Penny wonderfully and accurately describes the way in which music can transport the soul. Her analogies are highly evocative. \u201cThe monk examined Gamache. \u201c\u2026 We don\u2019t just sing, we are the song.\u201d Gamache could see he believed it. The Chief has a vision of the halls of the monastery filled not with monks in black robes, but with musical notes. Black notes bobbing through the halls. Waiting to come together in sacred song.\u201d The inclusion of humor adds levity, yet there is anger and pain as well. Her words are thoughtful and thought-provoking. There are contrasts such as describing one particularly dour monk as \u201cThe Eeyore of the monastery.\u201d, while having a doctor describe how \u201cPeople die in bits and pieces.\u201d Her writing causes you to stop and consider the concepts behind the words and can compel one to share passages with others. I\u2019ve been known to call friends at odd hours insisting that they \u201cListen to this.\u201dPenny\u2019s descriptions bring places and people to life, placing you at the scene and causing you to see, hear and know the things and people around you. Among Penny\u2019s many strengths is her ability to create characters about whom you want to know more. This is finally, I feel, the first time we see Gamache truly at his strength in his role. At the same time, we are made painfully aware that although he has a very close relationship, both to its credit and detriment, with his second, Jean-Guy, there are others who would do anything to discredit him. There is a wonderful segment where we learn of the same information but from two separate perspectives. Rather than being redundant, it truly exposes the differences in the personalities of Gamache and Jean-Guy. We also learn the details of the enmity between Gamache and his superior in whom she has created a distinct type of evil; a character who truly excels at manipulation and cruelty. The story is very well constructed with plots and sub-plots each as interesting as the next. Lest you think this is a cozy, it is not. It is a traditional police procedural solved by investigating and following the clues. It is also a story of relationships and strong emotions, and there is nothing cozy about them.Staying up most of the night reading is not something one would normally recommend. Staying up most of the night with a new book by Louise Penny is almost unavoidable. A reader begins every book with the hope of finding something wonderful. \u201cThe Beautiful Mystery\u201d is the realization of that hope. It is an excellent, beautifully written book that stays with you long after closing the cover yet leaves you wanting to demand the next book immediately. It is also only the latest in excellent series I recommend reading in order from the beginning.

In this one the murder of choirmaster in a remote cloistered order of monks leads Inspector Gamache and Agent Beauvoir of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec to travel there and live among the community until the mystery is solved. The site is of a fictional monastery established 300 years before by an order seeking a hide out from the Inquisition, Saint-Gilbert-Entre-les-Loups (\u201cBetween the Wolves\u201d). They have recently achieved much unwanted attention, and a lot of money, from a popular recording of Gregorian \u201cplainchants\u201d.Monastery in QuebecPretty hard to imagine what could lead a monk to commit murder. Gamache\u2019s explorations of this community slowly uncovers a schism related to ambitions about the music. The \u201cBeautiful Mystery\u201d of the title has to do with Christian faith and the devotion of accolytes of the Gregorian chant to achieve ecstasy in speaking and praying to God through music. In the middle ages, the efforts to codify how the music was to be sung led to the invention of written music, which took the form symbolic hand gestures called neumes. The first clue for Gamache concerns a piece of vellum on the monks body with a strange chant and neumes. Example of primitive musical notation, neumes, placed over Latin words of a Gregorian chantSome readers may be bored by the slow action and focus on ancient music. But the treat for me is in the interplay between Gamache and Beuvoir. They are both in recovery from a case covered in a previous book which involved much mayhem and serious injuries to both. They are both challenged by the arrival of their nemesis on the scene, the Superintendent of the Surete. The result adds quite a bit of psychological warfare to the story. I agree with this conclusion from a review in the Globe & Mail: ... works as a catalyst for an ongoing series of inquiries into the nature of faith, loyalty and friendship, deepening familiar characters and developing relationships in a realistic, often painful fashion. It\u2019s a stirring, thought- provoking read, less a matter of whodunit than a relentless questioning of why any of us do anything.

A monk, the choirmaster, has been murdered on a quiet, isolated island off Quebec where the monastery of Saint-Gilbert-Entre-les-Loups has been home to the Gilbertine monks since the middle of the 17th century. Only recently discovered after centuries of obscurity, these monks have the mission of singing and preserving the purity of the Gregorian chant. Gamache and his right-hand man, Jean-Guy Beauvoir, must break through vows of silence and mistrust of outsiders to discover who amongst the holy monks could have murdered one of their own. The task is complicated by the arrival of Superintendent Sylvain Francoeur, a corrupt force in the police who would like nothing better than to be rid of Gamache. Francoeur works his own evil, while Gamache and Beauvoir search for a killer.Every year, Louise Penny gifts readers with a superbly written mystery, and this year was no exception. I did miss the village of Three Pines and its endearing characters of her past novels, but I suppose even Three Pines needed a break from murder. I do hope Penny hasn't left the setting permanently. The Gregorian chant focus and the reclusive monks were an interesting departure. Gamache remains one of my favorite characters in fiction today, and the story moves at just the right pace. The character of Jean-Guy Beauvoir takes an unexpected twist, which I'm anticipating a resolution to in the next novel of the series.

The unexpected popularity of a recording of their chants has created dissension in their ranks and a monk is murdered. Gamache and Beauvoir are called in to investigate.The problems I have with this book: the abbot's recruiting of new members, poaching them from other monasteries on the basis of their voices (like football recruiters?) - the description of monastery life as a whole is not very convincing. The Latin errors. The Francoeur thing - to drop him into the middle of this so he can wreak havoc on all and sundry, for what? Melodrama instead of actual drama? The subplot of the enmity between Francoeur and Gamache is an annoying distraction, or would be if there were anything much going on plotwise. And the other drop in - the mysterious Dominican from the Inquisition who just happens to have been trying to trace an ancient manuscript for years and shows up just in time to reveal the killer - timing IS everything. And finally the decline and fall of Beauvoir - three months sober, happily in love, one dose of Oxy then psychotic withdrawal symptoms, within hours?

Cozy mysteries are traditional mysteries that contain little or no sex or violence and are often set in a closed setting with an amateur detective (think Christie's Miss Marple books or TV's \"Murder, She Wrote\"). Over the last 8 years, Penny has been nominated each year for best novel and has won 5 times. Pretty impressive. I've only read 2 of her books, but \"cozy mystery\" definitely describes her style. In both books, a murder has been committed and Inspector Armand Gamache of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 arrives to solve it. There's a group of suspects and, as Gamache questions them, secrets are slowly revealed and possible motives and suspects come to light. I read the 2nd book in the series, A Fatal Grace, and skipped over all the rest to read this, the 8th book in the series. One of the dangers of reading books out of sequence in a particular series is that the author sometimes references early books and the reader comes across spoilers to those esrlier books. This did happen a couple of times in this book. A few earlier cases were referenced and the denouement of each were described (one in great detail). Another danger of reading a series out of sequence is that there are often secondary plots that continue over the course of several books. This is largely a standalone story, but there is a secondary plot that has an important part in the story. There is serious conflict between Gamache and his boss and what that conflict is and how it came about is crucial. If you haven't read any of the earlier books, Penny does use exposition to bring you up to speed, so if this is your starting point in the series, you'll not really be at a disadvantage Penny is a good writer, with well thought out plots and deft characterizations. There is plenty of amusing banter between Gamache and his assistant, Beauvoir, to keep things lively and the secondary plot brings an element of tension to the story. Taking place in a remote Catholic monastery in Quebec, the setting of this novel is interesting and refreshingly different. The mystery itself follows the cozy mystery style very closely. Prior to the start of the novel, one of the monks is murdered and, gradually, secrets and potential motives are revealed until the final denoument and the killer is unmasked. Who the killer is and why he killed makes sense once the reveal is done and I wasn't able to guess earlyAll in all, this is one I would highly recommend for lovers of myteries. While the murder is wrapped up with a nice, neat bow, the secondary plot isn't and now I have to read the next book to find out what happens."}, {"userName": "Obsidian", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian", "userReview": "This Gamache doesn't hang together very well. When Gamache and two of his team are called to a monastery to investigate a murder, things once again come to a head with Jean- Guy and Gamache's supervisor who is intent on making him pay for not being corruptible. I also didn't get much of the discussion about the chants/singing that was discussed throughout the book. I think it's been about three months since the events in the last book. Jean-Guy is now dating Annie (Gamache's only daughter) and just oozes love now. The way they are together now gave me whiplash. Especially since I didn't read a hint of this in the prior book. It honestly doesn't feel earned. Jean-Guy acts like a fool worrying how Gamache will take it when he finds it. But also daydreams about being related to him. Gamache is focused on the case and finds himself in awe of visiting the monastery that has come into public focus now that the monks singing Georgian chants has become the new thing. He realizes quickly after Francoeur shows up, that the man is planning something. Again. It's just repetitive at this point. We hear about the video tape again. Jean-Guy watches it again and gets bitter again about Gamache leaving him to die.Honestly I ended up skimming most of the book after a while. I just didn't care anymore. Either tell readers who released the tape, of the raid or don't. Either have Jean-Guy get over it or not. I hope Annie dumps his butt but that's probably doubtful.The writing was so-so. I just found it boring to read about the chants and what they meant. Everyone has a look of bliss/Joy when discussing singing. I found it pretty repetitive after a while. Penny shows Gamache and Jean-Guy at several points writing to their respective wife and girlfriend. I assume I'm supposed to imagine how perfect Jean-Guy is since he is acting similar to Gamache? I just went meh.The setting of the monastery should have been intriguing, but falls flat when Francoeur shows up and throws his weight around. The ending leaves Gamache alone. I'm still going to read the next book, hope it bounces back from this."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1460812-mary", "userReview": "\"That word? I do not think it means what you think it means\" (Inigo Montoya, quoting from memory.)Warning: Spoilers ahead! Like the others in Louise Penny's series, this was a quick and (for the most part) easy read. Briefly, it told two stories: that of a murder in a monastery in northern Quebec, and that of Jean-Guy Beauvior, still struggling to overcome his many wounds (physical and emotional)and to protect his boss, Gamache, from his boss's boss. That second story was convincing and absolutely gripping. Francouer, the \"big boss\", is as convincing a portrait of human evil as I've come across in a book. He's as believable as Dickens's Steerforth and Tolkien's Saruman, and far less sympathetic than either. I really felt for the insecure (if brave and loyal) young man caught in his wiles. The primary mystery, however, felt contrived, and simply fell apart at the end. It wasn't the setting, which was actually well-realized. It wasn't that tensions between the monks got ugly, with one of them becoming a murderer. It was that, IMHO, Penny relied on cliches in devising her clues, and that one of these - a major one - simply made no sense at all. And now I'm getting into spoiler territory.SpoilersSpoilersSpoilersThe choirmaster is found dead with a nasty head wound in the Abbot's private garden. He is curled up around a piece of parchment with neumes (an early form of musical notation) on it. Obviously, a fellow monk must have killed him, but why? And what is this piece of music the dead man is clutching?As the story goes on, and the monks begin to talk to the investigators, it transpires that Frere Mathieu's last words were \"Ecce homo\". It's described as \"homo\", preceded by a sound like clearing the throat. Sorry, no dice. There is no way on earth that \"ecce\" sounds like someone's throat being cleared. This clue is contrived so that everyone can get exercised over a possible homosexual love affair. Now, that's all right. In his rule, St. Benedict has clear directives to help monks avoid special friendships, the abuse of children, and so on. This clearly indicates that the founder of monasticism was well aware of these abuses, and that they existed - however rarely. I didn't have much problem with the way the monks were shown, either. There were some charming characterizations. But it was just silly that the murderer would have repeated Pontius Pilate's words while bashing his mentor over the head, and it was even sillier that the poor dying man would repeat them, rather than trying to name his murderer. Really contrived! Finally, Pilate's words do not mean what Penny says they mean. And her information about the Cathars is incomplete and somewhat misleading.So, in future, if I want to read a mystery with a fallen-away Catholic and his relationship with the Church, I'll stick to Elly Griffiths and the Ruth Galloway stories. She does it better. On the other hand, I am dying to know what will happen to poor, deluded Jean-Guy.

It is up to Gamache and Jean Guy Beauvoir to travel to the remote Quebec wilderness to be some of the first outsiders ever admitted to St. Gilbert entre les loups to solve the case. The mystery of the murder is relatively straightforward, the biggest obstacle being to decipher what the murder weapon was and who had opportunity. Up until the final denouement, I was vacillating between two possibilities. One would think I have learned my lesson with Gamache books: be careful what you ask for in the world of Three Pines. After A Rule Against Murder I was impatient to return to Three Pines, and The Brutal Telling put me through the ringer as the small town and all the characters I care about were raked over the coals.

But it is natural -- Three Pines is very small, and there are so only many murders that can happen there. So, here we are taken to the monastery of Saint-Gilbert-Entre-les-Loups, hidden deep in the wilderness of Quebec. It is a monastery that does not accept any outside intrusion and where there is a vow of silence. To this monastery Chief Inspector Armand Gamache and Jean-Guy Beauvoir of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec arrive, having been called because of the murder of Fr\u00e8re Mathieu, the Prior and choirmaster, with a brutal blow to the head. Once there, they discover disquiet beneath the silence.I will not dwell on the plot, as this is a review, not a summary. What follow are some observations, and they contain what some call \"spoilers\" -- necessary to make my points. I had read, followed, and recommended Penny's mysteries from the beginning. I wrote a five star review of A Trick of the Light, which I loved. What happened here that makes me unable to give this work five stars?The novel is centered on the Gregorian chants and the 24 monks who sing them several times daily (now 23.) Their hypnotic allure is called the \"beautiful mystery,\" and Gamache is immediately drawn to them as are we, the readers. I have to confess I read part of the novel with a CD of Gregorian chants in the background, as I was carried away and needed to hear them too. Beauvoir finds them irritating and boring. We need to make this point, maybe to try to understand what happens later on. But we know a lot about Beauvoir already.Everything about the novel, from the mystery to the daily life of a Gilbertine monk, is written in great detail and is truly moving and entrancing. We are mostly indoors, trapped in the monastery as the monks are. Only now and then do they venture out to work the soil, gather blueberries, look after the chickens. There are also secret doors and passages, as well as the potential hidden treasure. And there happens to be a treasure, as we find out later, but one that is in plain view, unknown to anyone there. It falls upon another \"intruder\" a Dominican monk, to find it. All the time, Gamache is trying to gather clues to solve the mystery, but the solution eludes him.But -- it is when Chief Superintendent Sylvain Francoeur arrives that the novel takes an unexpected turn. We are still dealing with the mystery, and eventually Gamache solves it, but Francoeur has brought two things that will disrupt the calm and take the plot in another direction, a subplot that acts like an invader: a CD of the raid that happened in the past and which is still somewhat unresolved, and a bottle of OxyContin. With these two items he manages to challenge and change the lives of the two outsiders -- Gamache and Beauvoir. Francoeur instills more than doubt in Beauvior's mind; it is poison, which succeeds in making him doubt and finally desert not only Gamache but Annie, whom he dearly loved all along and is now having an affair with. We saw part of it at the beginning, only to be taken away almost immediately, as an anticipation of what was about to happen.It is almost absurd to think that Francoeur went all the way to the monastery on a plane that announced his arrival loudly, and took the CD and the bottle of OxyContin for revenge. How could he tell what was going to happen? And why put himself in such a plight, when he has everything to lose? It is equally absurd that, when Beauvoir has to choose, he goes with the devil -- as he had always labeled Fancoeur, all because he is under the influence of the opiates.This sudden, unexpected, and unresolved turn ruined the novel for me. Even more, it made me angry, upset, annoyed. Angry at Beauvoir; angry at Penny for bringing something that does not fit with the rest of the novel. Why, I ask? Why here? And why something so ridiculous as a CD and the OxyContin??? We know that Sylvain Francoeur hates Gamache. But we also know he is Chief Superintendent. Why is it that I cannot accept this turn of events? And I am not alone. There are many others who feel the same, so there must be something wrong we all see in this.After Beauvoir makes his choice, which many of us do not understand, even if he is drugged and in pain, Gamache has a look of such sadness in his face it almost breaks the abbot's heart. And then, at the very end, as Gamache looks into the sky and feels the North wind on his upturned face, the words \"Some malady is coming upon us\" are printed in italics. Is it a hint of future events? After this, even the sound of the plane disappears carrying Francoeur and Beauvois, and Gamache is left with a great silence - the silence of the monastery when there were no chants, as opposed to its glory as soon as the monks sang. It is Saint Gilbert between the wolves, not among them - a place of perpetual choice. And Beauvoir has made a final (maybe) choice. We are left with that doubt, and it is something we don't need at this point and in this novel."}, {"userName": "\u2728Susan\u2728", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21276121-susan", "userReview": "When Gamache, and Beauvoir are assigned a murder case in a remote monastery they step into a different world.
