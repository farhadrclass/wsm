The actual location is left mysteriously unclear although we do know that it is an island. It is 1982 and the main character, September 'Sep' Hope and teens Arkle, Mack, Lamb and Hadley have spent the summer together. In the forest they find an ancient stone box to which they each consign important sacrifices to cement their recent friendships. They promise to agree a number of things, including to never return and remove any contents. The disparate friends are no longer together in 1986 but reconnect when it becomes clear one of them has gone behind their backs and broken their pact. Despite their efforts to rectify their mistakes, events begin to slide desperately out of their control as horrific repercussions begin to play out. This is a tense and menacing story with many of the requisite horror tropes of crows, zombies, wicked dolls, and so much more. It touches on the issues of the nature of friendship amongst the young. A creepy and sinister read, ideal for those who enjoy horror. Many thanks to Penguin for an ARC."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.One summer 70's evening, five boys discover a box in the woods. To cement their friendship, the friends decide to make sacrifices to the box by giving up something meaningful to place inside, with the threat that if one of them opens the box, terrible things will happen.1982, and the friends have drifted apart. Until terrible, wicked things start to happen. Someone has broken the pact and opened the box.On ready the blurb for this, I immediately drew comparisons with IT, The Goonies and Stand By Me which unfortunately does not help the novel. There's nothing new here, except a large portion of animal cruelty. I believe the novel is aimed at young adults and children - yet I found some of these violent scenes quite graphic in nature, and uncomfortable to read about. They didn't seem to fit with the target audience at all.The characters, when comparing to these classic 80's films and novels, are also rather underdeveloped. We never spent enough time with one character (with the possible exception of Sep) to really understand their nature and get to know them. It's also hard to understand how any of these boys were even friends. There's no emotional connection between them at all except for their link to the box. This is proven by the fact that they've drifted apart by the time 1982 comes around.The plot also suffers, as the author tries to pull the reader in several directions at once, not allowing you to concentrate on one plot development at a time. This makes the story convoluted and confusing at times as I was constantly trying to remember what everyone was doing at any given time. There was too much going on at once.Disappointing."}, {"userName": "Kirsty &#x1f4da;&#x1f4d6;\u2764\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5390112-kirsty-x1f4da-x1f4d6", "userReview": "One of the great things I loved about this book was the setting. It\u2019s set in 1986 and the lead characters are just 1 year older than me at the time. It brings about such great memories of bad hair, outlandish dress sense and some fabulous music. I\u2019d give it all the stars just for setting alone.Four years previously the gang, after a wonderful summer each made a sacrifice to a stone box they find in the woods (do these things ever end well??). As you can imagine this comes back to haunt them as, now estranged as friends, one of them opens the box in a fit of loneliness wanting to get the gang back together. It has disastrous consequences.Turns out back during WW2 another set of youths did the same thing. Opening up the box in 1986 sets the monstrous sacrifices free to murder.As mentioned, I loved the setting of 1986. I also liked it being set on a small island (Arran possibly based on the blurb at the back). So often thrillers are based in big cities but I felt the smaller setting worked to increase the sense of fear and horror and make the book even more tense.The bulk of the book is set over just a few days so the pace is fast, it\u2019s a real page turner.I loved all the little headings, I loved the characters. The main 5 all reminded me of 80\u2019s films \u2013 your Stand By Me\u2019s and your Goonie\u2019s and again it harks back to my own school days. I could probably give each of the characters names from my own childhood. So for me very relatable.It\u2019s dark, it\u2019s edgy, there\u2019s horror and humour. Basically it has everything.

It is in many ways but for me more as a bang through kind of thing rather than feeling any depth or substance. Having said that descriptively speaking this author has a certain something that has made me want to read his next book - I think the problem here was lack of character levels.With the exception of Sep I didn't really feel I got to know the gang with enough engagement to make me care what was happening. His need to leave the island and the 80's setting were probably the strongest parts of The Sacrifice Box for me - the wider horror story just feeding into his personality enough to keep me reading.The premise is sound but the execution is a little wishy washy. While I think the target market will probably love it, this was not one of those young adult novels that spoke to me on a higher level. Fast, with a certain fun element but nothing stand out."}, {"userName": "Sassy Brit", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1003021-sassy-brit", "userReview": "Visit all my reviews here. I love to chat books! Pop by, leave your review links! When a bunch of kids, September \"Sep\" Hope, Arkle, Mack, Lamb and Hadley discover an ancient stone box, they decide to each sacrifice something important to them to cement their friendship. As they do this they make a pact: never return to the box at night; they'll never visit it alone; and they'll never take back their offerings. Break any of these rules and who knows what could happen... A few years later in 1982, they are thrown together again as things started to go awry and it's clear someone has opened the box, because terrible things start happening. They try to rectify what they've done but nothing, it seems, will work, and like Pandora's box - once it's opened all the horror they can think of are released into their lives. And the box wants revenge. From the very first scenes I was totally hooked. Why were these kids sacrificing objects they loved for this box? What will happen if they disobey the rules? Because you just know someone is going to, right? I was surprised this creepy horror was aimed at young adults, as there are some great, yet gross and even some pretty cruel stories within this book! It's not for the fainthearted ya readers. That's for sure. An entertaining trip back in time, reminiscent of those old 80s films revolving around a bunch of kids having to deal with much more than they bargained for, with dire consequences to contend with if they don't make a stand. Yes, it does sound rather like Stand by Me, with supernatural elements and for good reason too. I enjoyed it a lot and thought it had a very English, village feel to it. I don't know whether that was just me, or not, but its the impression I got as I read this. Overall The Sacrifice Box had a crazy, pacy edge to it, alongside some heartfelt moments with characters which ended up feeling like my friends. An engaging coming of age book about friendship, love and hidden terrifying truths just waiting to resurface. Thanks to NetGalley for my copy.

I normally don\u2019t read horror books, it\u2019s not at all my genre, but I did enjoy reading this one (surprisingly)! The story is about Sep (whose name is actually September), he\u2019s lonely, has no friends and wants to move from the island he lives to the mainland to go to school there and become an engineer. The story is set in the 1980\u2019s but there are flashbacks to what happened before the main storyline.\u201cThey spoke the words\u2013the rules of the sacrifice.\u2018Never come to the box alone,\u2019 they said, hands unmoving.\u2018Never open it after dark,\u2019 they said, fingers joined together.\u2018Never take back your sacrifice,\u2019 they finished\u2013then let go.\u201dWhat I really liked about this book was the dark, gruesome and very atmospheric writing. It was so well-written and vivid! I loved that it gave the story more atmosphere. It wasn\u2019t really scary, but I\u2019m not sure it is supposed to be (like I said, I don\u2019t normally read horror), but it was engrossing and made me keep reading! I was really invested in how it was going to end and whether it all was going get a happy ending or not!A thing that annoyed me, which was not really anything that was wrong, was how there were so many nicknames used in the story! All the teens in the group of main characters use both their real name, last name and nicknames and it was so confusing! I couldn\u2019t tell them apart and that really annoyed me because that way all the character depth and development was lost to me. At one point there was someone named Daniels and for the sake of me, I do not know who the hell this character was.Yesterday he\u2019d woken up with his world in order: his mum was well, his exams were over, his boarding school application was nearly complete. No obstacles. Everything he\u2019d work for.And now what?His mum was getting sick again.He was bunking off school with the others.And his teddy bear was trying to kill him.As a sidenote, I was scrolling through some reviews on goodreads and some mentioned that the book was too gruesome for the YA age range and all of those reviews were written by adults (judging by profile pictures)\u2026 I am no teen myself, but as a 21-year old, I think it\u2019s fair to say I think teens and young adults are used to more gore than they (these adults) think. Anyway, if you cannot stand reading about blood, killing of animals or gore, this might not be for you.\u201c\u2018We\u2019re all little miracles,\u2019 she said, \u2018everything about us: all our stupid habits and our jokes and our weird faces, on a spinning ball that\u2019s a perfect distance from the sun. And now here we are, you and me, sitting on top of a million years of history.'\u201dI am giving this book 3.5-4 stars because despite that it was completely not as I expected it to be, I really enjoyed the book! The characters were a bit lost to me, but that might just be my quirk.

Because, its barely a month into the year but I don\u2019t think any other book is going to be able to top this. I do not think my expectations have ever been higher for a book - I watched a Youtube video from Heart Full of Books (who I believe got a proof from YALC) and then I read all of the PR that compared it to Stranger Things and Stand By Me, which are two of my favourite television series and movies of all time, and I was like, \u201cOMG I CANT WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON THIS\u201d.Unfortunately, the main thing I got out of reading The Sacrifice Box was a renewed appreciation for just how good things like Stranger Things and Stand By Me are, to have achieved that iconic cult status that labels them as genre-staples. These two, alongside others like IT and The Goonies, are certainly not things that come around very often, and The Sacrifice Box felt like a mere shadow in comparison to them. The character nuances, the world-building (I\u2019m becoming more and more certain the only reason it is set in the 1980\u2019s is so that the author could put in an excessive amount of references to September\u2019s walkman), the unadulterated emotion; these are all things in which these excelled and The Sacrifice Box fell painfully short.Honestly, the only thing I can think of right now is the fact that the media used to refer to actress Jayne Mansfield as the \u201cpoor man\u2019s Marilyn Monroe\u201d and I think that a similar sentiment really rings true here. I know, I know, that sounds harsh but let\u2019s face it, September and the gang are never going to reach the iconic status of the Losers\u2019 Club, or Eleven, or Chris Chambers, or Sloth from the Goonies - they\u2019re just not memorable or relatable enough for the audience to feel any degree of empathy towards. Speaking of the Losers\u2019 Club, I find it incredibly odd that all of the advertising focussed heavily on the supposed similarities between The Sacrifice Box, and Strangers Things and Stand By Me when clearly, it is tried far more to resemble the kids from IT. Honestly, it brings absolutely nothing new and I supposed it could've been salvaged if it had brought a more terrifying analysis of childhood fears and a better conclusion to the forefront, but it didn\u2019t even manage that. Whereas the things that The Losers\u2019 Club were scared of were actually pretty terrifying (remember Eddie's fear of disease?), in The Sacrifice Box, these sixteen(?)-year-olds are chased down by a murderous teddy bear\u2026. I mean, I know at the age of twenty-two I am a little outside of the YA target age range, but I can\u2019t imagine anyone over the age of nine being scared of a killer toy. So, yeah\u2026. Sorry The Sacrifice Box but I do not think I am going to be replacing my love for your predecessors any time soon.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for sending me a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Head on over to http://bit.ly/2y7JSWV for this book, as well as all of the others featured in my reviews, complete with the added bonuses of free worldwide shipping and bringing a little joy to my life."}, {"userName": "Kirsti", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5581493-kirsti", "userReview": "I've always enjoyed horror books, while hating that they scare me at the same time. Although this one wasn't too scary, it had enough scary/gross out moments that I could appreciate it. Basically it is the story of five friends who are driven together for just one summer, and then when High School begins are driven apart again by well, High School. That one Summer they had together, they discovered a box and each put a sacrifice in, vowing to never remove them, never visit the box alone, and never come after dark. Of course, rules are meant to be broken.This sets off a chain of mysterious events that I guess never really get fully explained. I would have liked to know more about the box, more about how the average person reacted to Kitty terrorizing the nighbourhood after getting hit by a car etc etc. While I felt like there were moments where things could have been better explained and the story veered off course, it was action filled and very graphic writing.I've seen a few reviews compare to Stranger things/Stephen King, but this story holds its own too.

Hello, I could have told you from the beginning that suspicious boxes in the middle of dark forests are not to be messed with, but did anyone listen? No, no. And look what has happened. So much horror, so much blood, so much terror.This is one of those books I have been looking forward to for some time, and then I spotted while I was in the UK for a short vacation and wanted it even more. Sadly, I couldn't bring it with me. Yay for carry on baggage and me wanting to bring other souvenirs back as well (plus I already had 2 or 3 books with me to bring back :P). And then when we got home my boyfriend sweetly surprised me by buying this book! <3 Thanks sweetie!This book was amazing, it was everything I hoped, and more! It was creepy, it was a big NOPE NOPE NOPE *flails and hides*, it had a few eye roll moments, it was fun. It was just perfect. I didn't feel bored one moment, though I have to say that I sometimes wanted to stop reading because it was a bit gruesome at points (and that escalated as the story progressed). Our MC is Sep, though we also have POVs of other characters. These characters may seem insignificant at first, but believe me everyone plays a role. Everyone has something to do with either Sep or the box. Sure, I didn't always like all the characters, for instance it took me quite a bit of time to get used to Mario (he was just odd and his way of speaking was quite distracting). And some characters I could never like... Daniels, the bully. Not only does the book have multiple POV but we also have 3 different times. First up is 1982, the summer when Sep was friends with Arkle, Lamb, Mack, Hadley and that was also the summer they did the sacrifice. Next is 1986 which is the current year, and the year everything will go wrong and it will bring these friends back together in a way they didn't expect. Then there is 1941 when another group of kids was tricked by the box. And yes, this time is also important. Very much so even, you may not know it first, but then you see all the connections, the web that leads from 1941 to 1982 and to 1986. I definitely went: OMG, it is that girl! at a point, and then some more OMG when I saw other connections. The box is definitely out to kill. Not only those who broke its rules, and those who didn't get what it was capable of, but everything. Believe me, these kids, this whole island is in for one hell of a freaky ride. I just loved how the author wrote the creepy parts, he did an amazing job on them. Believe me I was often quite terrified, as a lot of these things happened at night. Later on it also started to happen at other times. Then there was the gore, not really my favourite thing in books (or shows/movies), but it does fit perfectly with this book (and even if I want to deny it, that one scene where they had to do x to Sep to remove y was disgusting as hell and I was cringing so hard and I almost had to puke, but even that one fitted, though I could have done without it *shivers*). It shows that the box is clearly not afraid to show its power. It is a real killer of a box. :P They should have really thought before they put in the stuff they did. Then again, I can imagine these kids just thought it was harmless fun. It was something to remember the summer and their friendship.I am still not entirely sure what to make of Sep. He seems like a great guy, and I can also imagine that he may just not trust his friends that much given that, from his POV, they dropped him as soon as school started. They haven't tried to contact him once (well... neither did he), he is getting bullied and no one does a thing. It was interesting that he was deaf, or at least half. How that happened, well I thought it was like this from birth.. but Sep hasn't had the easiest life. That is all I will say.There is also a bit of romance and I have to say that it wasn't weird or out of place, if anything I found myself rooting for the two and enjoying the moments of light-heartedness in the whole chaos that was starting to take place. The other characters, Lamb, Hadley, Mack, Arkle? I quite liked them when we really started to get to know them. Saw their quirks, their personalities, their ways of talking. Even though I am against putting things on fire, I did like that Arkle had a knack for setting stuff on fire. Lamb? It took me a while to like her. She was just so bossy, at times rude, and I also didn't like how she immediately went to point a finger to Sep instead of maybe thinking that it may be someone else entirely. I also adore the book takes place in 1986, such a special year for me. And it was fun to see walkmans, nintendo consoles, and all sorts of other stuff again. Plus horror just becomes creepier when you can't contact each other as easily as one can in these years. No cellphones, no mail!Who opened the box/who broke the rules? I have to say that until it was revealed I had absolutely no clue. I went through my head pass all the suspects, but I just couldn't figure it out. Thanks author for making it not that obvious. *thumbs up*The ending was even more of a rollercoaster. If you aren't strapped in already, get ready to add a few more straps and buckles. :P I did think what happened with the box/Sep at the end was a bit weird and it did feel slightly rushed/incomplete, but I still liked it. I think I just didn't want the book to end just yet. My boyfriend also had quite a laugh as I was NOPE NOPE NOPING quite a few times, and not that softly either (sorry neighbours, I know it was late evening, but I just couldn't stop myself). :PPlus points to the cover! Well, I think I have mentioned the important parts that I wanted to tell, of course I could still rave about this book a bit longer, but I don't think people want to read a book-sized book review for a book. So I will end with this: I would highly, VERY highly recommend this amazing book to everyone. If you are looking for a very creepy, at times a bit gore-filled, story be sure to check out this book. Plus it features some fabulous and interesting characters.

How am I meant to explain the multitude of emotions that coursed lme every night when I picked this book up?The Sacrifice Box\u00a0is both touching and terrifying and I don't quite know how that works so well. I finished this book at 2:30am and even now I'm still not sure how to feel.MY MAIN ADVICE:\u00a0Don't look into the plot before reading.It's so much more fun to work it out based on a vague synopsis.There is a box. A group of friends discover\u00a0it and each place items into the box as a sacrifice. They swear to follow three rules: Never come to the box alone; Never open it after dark; Never take back your sacrifice. This is what happens when the rules are broken.That's all I knew when going into the book and I admit to being pretty confused in the beginning when everything was very vague and people were asking questions and getting non-answers in return. But it's one of those books. It kind of gave me\u00a0We Were Liars\u00a0vibes for a while, but I actually understood this book a little more.\u00a0You go from knowing absolutely nothing to knowing it all, and it's a bit of a jigsaw.It was a very creepy jigsaw as well. I don't want to give anything away, but no wonder why everyone uses dolls and crows when it comes to horror. It's bloody terrifying. It had a great dark, atmospheric feel to it, causing me to jump at the slightest noise in my house.It was also very graphic. Now I may be a scaredy-cat when it comes to horror, so even the littlest of things can creep me out, but I am usually okay when it comes to gory scenes. I was not okay reading this. I will warn any of you animal lovers that it does include a lot of graphic and gruesome animal deaths, and a little more. I was very disturbed by these parts of the book and it made me so sad to see them like this.But on a less creepy note, I was surprised to find out just how touching this story was. From what I've just said, you're probably wondering how that is possible? The answer is: I don't know. I still can't understand it at all.I loved that there was a strong focus on friendship, and what real friendship is meant to be. I actually found myself being really touched by the characters.I did find it difficult to feel for all the characters. I just feel like some we really didn't get to know as well. I understand Arkle\u00a0so\u00a0well but I still don't really know Lamb all that well. There were a lot of characters to keep track of during the book so at times it was a little confusing. I just couldn't figure out what motives were behind some of their actions at certain points.But I will say I never predicted what was going to happen. I was constantly on edge throughout this story but every time I thought it was headed in one direction it would twist and leave me confused all over again. While frustrating, I appreciate that it wasn't blatantly obvious.Despite the nightmares I will probably have from this book, I really enjoyed it.

Then let go.I have been forever ruined in the genre of horror after reading \nWhite Space\n by Ilsa Bick. Hands down, the best horror novel I have ever read and appallingly under appreciated. The characters are full and beautifully drawn, the setting is strange and engaging and the plot is so intensely batshit crazy and loaded with suspense that 560 pages rip by in one sitting. It is, at times, wildly gory but never gratuitous. I just really loved it. Unfortunately I now consider that to be the standard to which all other horror novels are expected to live up to. The bar is really fucking high. And The Sacrifice Box did not meet my impossible expectations. I don't think this is a bad book. I think part of it is me and my quest to never be satisfied with anything, ever. But I'm not taking all the responsibility for the three star rating. Book is not without fault. Listing the ways is always a hoot: CharacterisationWait, what characterisation? Yeah, exactly. I was initially enjoying the introductions of the characters and, to be fair, we got to understand Sep pretty well. But the rest of the gang? Not so much. I severely lost all interest in them and their plight when it became clear that four of the five members of the group were going to stay firmly in the background. Who are Lamb, Arkle, Mack and Hadley? I have no idea. SettingThe island is a cool setting and I get it. Sep dreams of escape and the island, for him, represents dead ends and unhappiness. He longs to travel to the mainland where he can attend school and move on with his life. The island also contains the crazy shit that's about to go down and basically removes the option of hightailing it out of there in a cloud of dust while creating a sense of claustrophobia. So yes, cool, fine, I'm here for it. But what I'm not so here for is the time period. The book is set in the 1980s, beginning in 1982 when the kids made their sacrifices and then spending the majority of the narrative in 1986 with a couple of flashbacks to the 40s when the original sacrifices were tossed in that damn box. But there was no real commitment to the 80s. It didn't feel like the 80s. Sure we had the walkman, and the pop culture references but it was just sprinkled in there for decoration. What defines a time period is so much more than the music that was listened to, or the movies that were watched. Political climates affect everyone to some extent and shape attitudes and motivations. And I mean, the 80s was an important decade in terms of cultural, social and political shifts in the UK. But we saw none of that. Martin Stewart has a beautiful way of painting a vivid scene. His description is stunning, I can't pick fault at that. But he doesn't really use this to inject any atmosphere into the scene setting. We're told that yeah, Sep has this walkman so it's clearly not 2018. And they're all about their mixtapes. But it was unconvincing because it was as superficial as that. I feel like the book is supposed to be reminiscent of Stranger Things, Stand By Me, IT, that kind of story, but it missed out the really important essence of those stories that included the time period being portrayed almost as another character in itself. In my opinion, it just really missed the mark. Disappointing. PacingWhat happened? We started off great, shit was going down, I was invested. And then? What? It just dripped on and on and honestly? Lost interest. I'm gonna hold my hands up and accept some of the responsibility here. I know I get very bored very easily. I have form for starting projects full of explosive enthusiasm only to drop them weeks later when I literally just cannot be fucked with it anymore.(And these aren't inconsequential art projects or whatever. I'm talking about whole jobs. I once took a residential job like, eight hours away from where I live now. I was there for like six weeks, was good at the job, and there was basically nothing wrong with it (except for the super creepy and inappropriate affair the manager (unfortunately she was also my housemate. Ugh) and the owner of the property were conducting, but I just woke up one morning and was like \"nah\", grabbed what I could carry of my stuff (which wasn't all that much. I left quite a few books behind. Super annoying) and left. Literally just wrote a note to this weird girl I was living with and working for and took off. So this is what I'm like. *Shrugs*)So you know, I have to accept some degree of responsibility. I know what I'm like. But book, some of it was you. The pacing felt really off to me. There was quite a lot of shit to keep up with, and not all of it was 100% comprehensible. I feel like we started out strong and then just kinda lost our way a little in the middle. It got slightly repetitive with the killer toys coming at us and then we get a little break and then, oops, there's the toys again. I also expected a lot more investigation. That's what I love about this kind of book, the part where they have to go on a quest to discover what's truly going down. And sure, we had Sep visiting with Aileen and then Roxburgh, but it felt thin. It was heavy on the zombie animals and lacking on any real development. It would have been a good opportunity to build the kids' characters up a little and solidify their friendship but we never quite got there, which provides me with a nice lead into my final gripe: ChemistryOr lack thereof. I didn't get a real friendship vibe from these kids. Not in the scenes from 1982 which were really too brief to glean much from, and not from the scenes from 1986, so the bulk of the book. I mean, why were/are they friends? I don't know. I'm not buying it. It's probably because the characterisation was too sketchy for me, but exploring their friendship a little further would have improved on that so?? It just felt like the kids were flung together one summer, had a blast and then moved on. And now this damn box is dragging five really different, and now older, kids back together in a super awkward and stilted way. I imagine them like \"Smile. Just fake it for the box. We can be friends, right?? Uncomfortably trying to force a friendship to prevent anymore death-by-toy. I mean, Lamb seemed like she knew what was happening. We just never really had any moments where it felt like the gang were truly invested in each other outside of this shitshow they had to put right. Like I said, this isn't a bad book. It has some really fun moments, the description is beautiful and the first half is certainly super engaging. It's really gory and there are quite a lot of ugly scenes involving animals so if you can't deal with that, then skip this. But it's an interesting read. Just not really for me."}, {"userName": "Kirsty Hanson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20248319-kirsty-hanson", "userReview": "I had to read The Sacrifice Box for the monthly book club at my local Waterstones. The premise of the book sounded so interesting! I love books that focus on friendship, and I do love a good thriller/horror novel! So this sounded like a perfect read for me.Sep, Arkle, Mack, Lamb and Hadley: five friends thrown together one hot, sultry summer. When they discover an ancient stone box hidden in the forest, they decide to each make a sacrifice: something special to them, committed to the box for ever. And they make a pact: they will never return to the box at night; they'll never visit it alone; and they'll never take back their offerings.Four years later, the gang have drifted apart. Then a series of strange and terrifying events take place, and Sep and his friends understand that one of them has broken the pact.As their sacrifices haunt them with increased violence and hunger, they realise that they are not the first children to have found the box in their town's history. And ultimately, the box may want the greatest sacrifice of all: one of them.Ok so wow this book was so different to what I was expecting it to be, and I don't even know whether I mean that in a positive or negative way. For the first 110 pages of the book, I just couldn't' get into it; I don't know what it was about the plot that made me not want to carry on reading it, but it just wasn't grasping my attention. And then... At about the 100 page mark, there was a walking, talking teddy bear, and for me that was it. I just couldn't read anymore. I imagined Ted (from the Ted films) and then the teddy bear from that one Supernatural episode mixed together... It was just... not funny... or scary... For me, it came across as well... stupid.I stopped reading it for about a couple of weeks because I didn't want to read about some weird teddy bear. But then, I decided that I should probably finish it because I hate DNF'ing books because you never know whether they're going to get better (or worse).\n\"Never come to the box alone.Never open it after dark.Never take back your sacrifice.\"- Martin Stewart, The Sacrifice Box\nSo I carried on... and to my surprise, it actually DID get better. The book got a lot more exciting as more action was taking place and there were zombies (?) I've put a question mark because I'm not 100% sure that they were even zombies. But basically, birds would die (or people), and then they would come back to life (which is a zombie trait) and it was just strange. Stewart didn't write that they were specifically zombies, but they definitely came across like that. And zombies DEFINITELY WERE NOT advertised on the blurb. BUT, they weren't a main part of the story, they come in towards the end of the novel.Also, I really do not understand how these five people became friends in the first place. There didn't seem to be any emotional connection between them, they had nothing in common and if anything, they came across as hating each other... Another strange element of the book. And it doesn't help that I didn't really have an emotional connection with the characters because we never spent a lot of time with any of the characters (apart from Sep, since he was our main protagonist), so I just didn't feel anything for them.Overall, I had quite high expectations of this book because the blurb reminded me of Stranger Things and it sounded like something that I would be interested in. However, it did let me down, hence it being a 3 star book for me. I didn't love it, and I didn't hate it. I'm glad I've finally read it but I can safely say that I don't think that I'm going to be re-reading it anytime soon."}, {"userName": "Nicola Wells", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14655594-nicola-wells", "userReview": "This review was first published on Bookality.com.Starting in 1982, Martin Stewart\u2019s second, stand-alone book, The Sacrifice Box, is an admirable combination of terrifying and dark-humour. Following the story of Sep (September), Mack, Arkle, Lamb and Hadley through their childhood summer when they discover a stone box in the forest. The box whispers rules. Never come to the box alone. Never open it after dark. Never take back your sacrifice. Their sacrifices to the box bind them. When four years later strange things start to happen Sep, Mack, Arkle, Lamb and Hadley find themselves drawn together. For me, the book raced along helped by the strong, witty characters. You\u2019re dragged through the chapters and a series of terrifying events. Sep, our protagonist, is an intelligent loner who has isolated himself from the others. Lamb, daughter of a farmer, is a fierce female, part teenage-girl, part woman-in-charge and part Wonder Woman. Arkle, the comedian of the group is a wonderful character. Throughout he lightens the mood, making the page-turning horror humorous and, frankly in some parts, readable. Mack, the football hero, and, Hadley, the lost soul with hidden depth, round the group off well. The Sacrifice Box is shocking. I didn\u2019t expect this level of supernatural-horror from a book written for a young adult audience. More than a couple of times I put the book down to give myself a break. I even finished certain chapters in public, knowing there is no way psychotic children\u2019s toys or possessed zombies could get me in the daylight. I enjoyed the 80s setting. It\u2019s written well, with enough hints at the era to attract a thrill from an adult audience, but not enough to distract you from the plot of the story. A level of detail with some of the 80s-based revival books and shows can be distracting. Acting as deliberate plot functions to mask a bad storyline, which isn\u2019t happening here. There was one disappointing part, the epilogue. The book ends strong, but Stewart takes us to a conclusion which should wrap up the adventure. For me, this did the opposite leaving a range of questions. So many, I\u2019ve considered emailing Stewart to find out how certain parts were so easily swept away. Stewart is masterful. He weaves a chilling, supernatural plot with a playfulness and brings the darkest chapters back from the edge. I suspect Stephen King would be impressed. But, I\u2019m warning you, if you like your fiction conclusive, neat and tidy, the final pages may leave you hollow.

First off let me give a trigger warning to potential readers that lots of animals die in this book which was quite upsetting (for me) and might be for you. It\u2019s the late 70s and a group of friends on an island near New York City, are spending the summer together. Thrown together by chance, a broken arm, friends at camp etc. Sep, Arkle, Lamb, Hadley and Mack uncover a mysterious box in the woods. Driven by a waking dream experienced by Sep, they decide to make sacrifices to the box to seal their friendship. Fast forward to 1982 and the five friends are no longer friends. When school started again, Sep earned himself the nickname \u2018septic\u2019 getting bullied by those he once made a pact of friendship with. He\u2019s also thinking of going to boarding school on the mainland. The others have their own lives and own worries. That is until the box is disturbed and terrible things begin to happen and the friends are thrown back together again. This book was first and foremost very weird. It jumped around quite a lot and I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve come away from it knowing what happened or making any sense of it. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that I just didn\u2019t get it. There seemed to be good storylines that pinged along and never came to anything and to be honest most of it was just really, really sad. I may have felt this way because I really don\u2019t like reading about animals dying, especially if said animals, die because they\u2019re trying to protect humans. So maybe that ruined it for me. But I don\u2019t know, maybe I don\u2019t get horror either as I\u2019m not really a horror fan! This book also smacked of Stephen King\u2019s Stand By Me a bit too much for my liking which made it feel a bit replicated. However, despite all that, I did read until the end so there must have been something keeping me going with it!"}, {"userName": "Matilda Chapman", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64506977-matilda-chapman", "userReview": "Firstly, yes..there are lots of similarities between IT and The Sacrifice Box. They both follow a group of predominantly misfit kids/teens as they try to solve a horrifying mystery and it's also set in the eighties. Stewart also takes seemingly innocent, and non-scary things and distorts them into something very unsettling.Sep was a charming lead and I really began to care for him as the novel progressed. The other four in the main group were good characters, but unfortunately I don't feel like they had enough of a focus, believing for once that this could have benefited from dual perspectives. There were some strong foundations for characterisation there, but it didn't quite reach it's full potential on that front.Martin's overall writing style is beautiful though. His descriptions are mesmerising and he has some of the funniest dialogue I've read in a YA novel for quite some time. The plot was a tad predictable and I could have done without the flashbacks, but it was a fun, spooky read. Nothing more, nothing less.I'm a little disappointed that it didn't live up to my personal expectations, but I know a lot of people who will enjoy this book more than I did and I can't wait to recommend it to them!"}, {"userName": "Yzabel Ginsberg", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg", "userReview": "[I received a copy of this book through Netgalley.]The blurb for this book immediately reminded me of some of the horror books I\u2019d read in the early 90s\u2014mostly Stephen King paperbacks my mother gave me, so this \u201880s + horror + kids\u2019 combination is one I\u2019ve known in quite a while, even though I haven\u2019t read such books in at least a decade or more. I suppose watching Stranger Things also put me back in the mood for those, and so here I was, getting into \u2018The Sacrifice Box\u2019.As far as horror stories go, a lot of the usual ingredients are here. Strange happenings. Kids who find they have to gather to stop something evil from happening (and they can\u2019t tell their parents, because they\u2019d just sound crazy). School life with its teachers, sports kids, and bullies and picking on a couple of the main characters, but all things considered, those pale compared to the real threat. A mysterious item with mysterious rules to follow, rules that get, of course, broken\u2014madness ensues. Dead animals coming back to life to attack people. Noises at night. A tiny town on an isolated island. The Halley comet looming over it all, like a bad omen.All in all, I liked the setting itself, although at times it \u2018tried a little too hard\u2019, so to speak. However, where the book lacked a lot was the characters. The main point of view is Sep\u2019s, interspersed with chapters viewed through the eyes of a couple of minor characters, like Mario, the vet doubling as chippy owner, in whose restaurant Sep works; or Thom and Aileen, two older people who also opened the box and made sacrifices back in 1941 when the war was raging (the story\u2019s set in the UK, by the way\u2014it\u2019s not always very clear, as the atmosphere feels very \u2018US-like\u2019). The problem is that, as far as the other four kids are concerned, I didn\u2019t get more than superficial impressions about them. For instance, Lamb is the hockey player, lives on a farm with her father, and lost her mother when she was a kid, yet apart from that and from her anger at whoever broke the rules of the box, I never really \u2018saw\u2019 her, who she was, how she really felt, her fears, and so on; and in such a horror-driven story, with such a concept of a box into which a band of children placed items loaded with both good and bad emotions, childhood fears, hopes and feelings would\u2019ve been a necessary element to play on for all the characters, not just one.I also didn\u2019t see the point to the bully. At first, I expected him to play more of a part\u2014perhaps the kind of character who ends up completely crazy, starts muttering about having to \u2018kill the evil\u2019, grabs a rifle, becomes an impediment to the kids\u2019 efforts to restore the order (it\u2019s a bit clich\u00e9, but it\u2019d have its place in such a plot). And then\u2026 It just petered out. In the same way, I would've appreciated more of a conclusion regarding the events and the box itself: the epilogue doesn't shed light on all the things that should've followed (how did the parents react, what about all the dead people, how were events explained officially, etc.). Here, too, some plot ends were left dangling.Conclusion: A fast read, and rather entertaining in a superficial way; but the novel kept feeling like an attempt to surf on the \u201cStranger Things\u201d wave, and didn't live up to the kind of books/stories it tried to be an homage to."}, {"userName": "Clare", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3737532-clare", "userReview": "This review was originally posted at Dual Reads Advance Reader Copy received for an honest review. This was so, so intense. There were moments of humour and lightness but there were also moments that made me tense up - and some that were outright scary. This has been compared to Stranger Things and Stephen King - which is a big comparison. I haven't seen Stranger Things and I've read nothing by King, but I get why the comparison was made. There's a sort of quirky horror in this book that feels utterly unique and hugely memorable.The pop culture references made me so happy - it's set in the 80s and the nostalgia kick for anyone who was a teen then is going to be huge. For me it was just before I was born (I missed out on a lot apparently) but references to Zelda and Hall & Oates still excited me! Each character was very realistic and relatable in various ways. I think my favourite would have to be Arkle but I did love all of them. Even if it took me a little longer to warm up to Mack. Sep is the protagonist and is a great one, he is intelligent and loyal and so seeing the story through his eyes added a lot of emotional kick.I wouldn't expect teddy bears or dolls to be as outright terrifying as they are in this book. And I'll admit when \"Barnaby\" first appeared I laughed. The idea of an animated toy feels way too Toy Story for me. But after he has gone on a violent rampage he becomes considerably less cute and funny and just a little bit more scary. There's one scene towards the end that has made me very wary of my childhood toys. The one thing I didn't love was the ending. For a book that so perfectly ratcheted up the tension and the action all the way through, the ending felt... anti-climactic. I just wish there had been more there, or maybe I just wanted more character deaths (am I a bad person??). Other than that though, this book was hugely satisfying and exciting. I would love to see it as a movie and I am very much looking forward to seeing what Stewart writes next!!"}, {"userName": "Amy (Amysbookcorner)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17920797-amy-amysbookcorner", "userReview": "Find review on my blog too :D One summer five friends find a mysterious box and they decide that they should put something that is important for them into the box, something that represents them.

Unfortunately, this isn't the only reason why I've had this book on my Kindle for several months and am only stating what I think about it now.I will be reviewing the actual story, and my rating isn't affected my technical difficulties.The entire premise of the story sounds fascinating. I am quite a fan of teenagers/young adults/pretty much anyone, stumbling across an idea that's fed to them and that leads to terrible events occurring to them. The idea of incorporating a time capsule, and a group of kids who are only friends due to circumstances so their ties to each other is fragile, grabbed my attention and I started it up a few days after downloading it.The issue with all of this is though the premise is interesting, the actual way it's laid out in the novel is disconcerting. There are too many characters involved in this, who either nearly an entire chapter dedicated just to their point of view, or else they have no input other than a few paragraphs. This back and forth stutters the story each time, pulling me out of the story. I believe the reason for this is to push the story along, to hang another tidbit in front of the reader but instead it just aggravated me. There was too much swinging back and forth, none of the threads appeared to be joining together and I was simply being led by the nose with another 'No, this is what you should be paying attention to'.At the point where completely different characters came in, in order to try and explain a bit more about the Sacrifice Box, I had had enough. I resorted to simply skimming along, barely paying any attention to it and at the end I simply deleted it. I felt nothing by the end of it, didn't care about any of the characters and couldn't explain what the rest of the story was about. The horror fell flat, there were too many character's stories running alongside each other and I didn't care who died or who survived. This honestly feels as though it needed a few more read-throughs with an editor before it was up for publishing.

Five kids with nothing in common--Sep, Arkle, Hadley, Lamb, and Mack--become instant friends. On the last day of summer, they find a stone box buried in the forest, and each places an object inside to seal their friendship. And they make rules:Never come to the box alone. Never open it after dark. Never take back your sacrifice.1986, the summer before eleventh grade. The five haven't spoken since that day in 1982. Sep has gone through the past four years alone and plans to escape to boarding school. But strange things are happening--mirrors are breaking unexpectedly, electricity is flickering in and out, and people are coming down with inexplicable physical ailments.Someone has broken the rules. And it seems the five committed more than objects to the box's ancient stone--they gave it their deepest secrets and darkest fears, and now these are being returned in a flood of shambling corpses, murderous toys, and undead pets.
