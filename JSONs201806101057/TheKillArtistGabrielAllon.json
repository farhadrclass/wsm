I expect spies to have a lot of personal baggage - why else would they gravitate to a profession that requires isolation, deception, moral ambiguity and high ideals (whether it's for a country, a religious belief, or personal gain). He had a rich background and I slipped very easily into the story, enjoying every moment. And then I found out it was the eleventh in the series. It's a mark of a great series when a book stands on its own, acknolwedging that a lot of water is under the bridge but you neither feel left out or beat over the head with recaps from prior books (the Sookie Stackhouse novels are for people who enjoy that kind of pain).I felt compelled to go to the beginning, The Kill Artist, which is the first book in the series and where we first meet Gabriel Allon. And lo and behold, even then you understand that he's already had his share of life, and death. Silva kicks off the series with a fully-formed Allon, a spy who has already lived the enviable James Bond-style life, had a family and great success, but who has lost it all. For anyone who loves heavy doses of exotic locations and political intrigue mixed (sparingly) with pinches of real world leaders, this series is superb. Silva is extraordinarily knowledgable about world affairs and shares insightful commentary (through his characters), due to his journalism background (including CNN) and his stint as a correspondent in the Middle East during the Iran-Iraq war. I will admit that I didn't know of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict origins and (if it's accurately told) now I have a much better understanding - there are truly two sides to that conflict.I'm looking forward to reading books 2-9 and now number 12. I have many, many good hours of reading ahead of me."}, {"userName": "Maria Jo\u00e3o Fernandes", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4635053-maria-jo-o-fernandes", "userReview": "\"Se estivermos a vigiar um alvo a partir de um caf\u00e9, n\u00e3o devemos fazer coisas que nos fa\u00e7am parecer estar a vigiar um alvo a partir do caf\u00e9, tais como ficarmos sentados sozinhos durante horas, a fingir estarmos a ler um jornal.\"Daniel Silva introduziu-me, da forma mais extraordin\u00e1ria, o mundo da espionagem. Pela primeira vez, este tema afigurou-se aos meus olhos, surpreendentemente sedutor, envolvente e enigm\u00e1tico. Cada vez que tive de interromper a leitura, para responder \u00e0s minhas necessidades mais b\u00e1sicas como comer e dormir, enfim, quest\u00f5es de sobreviv\u00eancia, senti-me como se nunca deixasse de fazer parte deste mundo imponente, repleto de vida. Durante a leitura fui mais que uma simples espectadora, sentindo verdadeiramente os medos e desejos do Gabriel Allon.Tudo come\u00e7a em Paris. A cidade da Luz e do Amor \u00e9 o palco da trag\u00e9dia que p\u00f5e em marcha o conjunto de eventos marcantes e vibrantes que caracterizam o enredo sem igual do \"O Artista da Morte\". Dois carros colidem. O tr\u00e2nsito p\u00e1ra. Um limusina \u00e9 bloqueada. Um assassino cumpre, mais uma vez, o seu trabalho.\"Quanto mais longe estamos do nosso \u00faltimo desastre, mais perto estamos do pr\u00f3ximo.\"De Fran\u00e7a aos Estados Unidos da Am\u00e9rica, de Inglaterra \u00e0 Palestina e at\u00e9 mesmo Portugal, nunca antes nenhum autor me tinha levado numa viagem t\u00e3o longa e maravilhosamente perturbante.Gabriel Allon tem um olhar intenso. Com 50 anos \u00e9 um homem atraente, habilidoso, meticuloso, misterioso, gentil e piedoso. Este restaurador de arte judeu, que em tempos foi um agente secreto israelita, v\u00ea-se novamente de volta ao mundo de espionagem. O nosso protagonista faz parte de dois mundos que, apesar de t\u00e3o diferentes, n\u00e3o podiam ser mais iguais. O espi\u00e3o domina a arte de matar e a arte de restaurar, destacando-se como um dos melhores do mundo. As suas ac\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o movidas por acontecimentos obscuros, pela dor da trag\u00e9dia e o desejo de vingan\u00e7a. Atormentado por um passado distante, o espi\u00e3o \u00e9 caracterizado por uma personalidade distinta. Interpreta diversos pap\u00e9is durante as suas miss\u00f5es e, independentemente do contexto em que esteja inserido, representa cada personagem com a maior naturalidade. \u00c9 um actor magistral, cujo palco \u00e9 o mundo real. Os seus pap\u00e9is nunca s\u00e3o demasiado pequenos, por muito escassas que sejam as falas ou o tempo que dedica \u00e0 personifica\u00e7\u00e3o. Gabriel Allon \u00e9 sempre o protagonista.\"A vingan\u00e7a \u00e9 boa. A vingan\u00e7a \u00e9 saud\u00e1vel. A vingan\u00e7a \u00e9 purificadora.\"Tariq \u00e9 um palestiniano revoltado, com uma mente distorcida e um desejo de derramar sangue pelos que perdeu demasiado grande para ser ignorado. Este l\u00edder terrorista tem uma intelig\u00eancia superior ao normal, afinal de contas domina a t\u00e9cnica da espionagem. Um advers\u00e1rio \u00e0 altura de Gabriel Allon que n\u00e3o \u00e9 um novo conhecimento, mas sim um inimigo h\u00e1 muito adquirido.Ari Shamram \u00e9, na opini\u00e3o de todos com quem trava conhecimento, um homem careca, bastante feio, cujo casaco com um rasg\u00e3o no peito direito suscita sempre alguma curiosidade. Este guerreiro da velha escola \u00e9 chamado da reforma para se tornar no chefe do Departamento - da ag\u00eancia secreta israelita - de forma a restaurar a sua reputa\u00e7\u00e3o manchada por miss\u00f5es falhadas. O seu m\u00e9todo de trabalho baseia-se no seu eterno h\u00e1bito de nunca deixar a m\u00e3o esquerda saber o que a direita est\u00e1 a fazer. Shamram \u00e9 o homem que nos apresenta o nosso her\u00f3i, o qual s\u00f3 \u00e9 capaz de fazer o seu trabalho com o auxilio de editoras, empresas de transporte, galerias de arte, farm\u00e1cias e outros tantos neg\u00f3cios legais, que actuam e s\u00e3o conhecidos a n\u00edvel mundial.Quando o Daniel Silva j\u00e1 tinha o controlo dos meus pensamentos e emo\u00e7\u00f5es, eis que me \u00e9 apresentada Sarah, conhecida no mundo da moda como Jacqueline Delacroix. A agente de 33 anos \u00e9 uma presen\u00e7a imprescind\u00edvel para o enredo. Esta mulher bela e independente \u00e9 uma poderosa presen\u00e7a feminina na vida de Gabriel Allon.Para al\u00e9m do astuto Shamram, do perverso Tariq, da lind\u00edssima Sarah e do talentoso Gabriel Allon, Daniel Silva apresenta-nos muitas outras personagens que, apesar de n\u00e3o serem principais, representam um papel igualmente importante. O autor n\u00e3o deixa nenhuma delas para segundo plano. Muito pelo contr\u00e1rio, apresenta-nos cada uma delas com descri\u00e7\u00f5es pertinentes e detalhes sedutores. Desde uma drogada que trabalha num bordel a um rapaz de 12 anos chamado Peel, o leitor tem acesso \u00e0 alma humana. As personagens s\u00e3o reais e as suas hist\u00f3rias de vida n\u00e3o podiam ser mais verdadeiras.\"Trabalho de espionagem \u00e9 paci\u00eancia. Trabalho de espionagem \u00e9 t\u00e9dio.\"O autor e antigo jornalista narra-nos uma hist\u00f3ria isenta de momentos enfadonhos, aliando, de uma forma perspicaz e estimulante, a fic\u00e7\u00e3o a factos hist\u00f3ricos.A guerra secreta entre os servi\u00e7os de espionagem israelitas e as guerrilhas palestinianas s\u00e3o introduzidos majestosamente: a luta dos judeus contra os terroristas que os querem ver mortos n\u00e3o podia ser retratada de uma forma mais convidativa e provocante. Com seriedade ou humor, detalhadamente ou superficialmente, de uma forma breve ou alongada, Daniel Silva tem o dom da escrita. O seu ritmo est\u00e1 em sintonia perfeita tanto com o leitor, como com o enredo.Nesta grandiosa luta entre os povos israelita e palestiniano, em que todos os meios justificam a salva\u00e7\u00e3o e defesa dos povos o desfecho \u00e9 surpreendente. Gabriel Allon \u00e9 um homem preso entre duas realidades, que ainda n\u00e3o encontrou a paz interior no seu mundo de v\u00e1rias camadas.\"O trabalho de um espi\u00e3o nunca est\u00e1 feito.\" Que venha o pr\u00f3ximo livro."}, {"userName": "K", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k", "userReview": "Eh. Kind of an ordinary spy thriller, one I might have appreciated more had I read it 15-20 years ago when I was less jaded.Like many of this genre, you have a good (and troubled) guy who works for Israeli intelligence working with his stunningly beautiful and capable heroine with whom he has a complicated (of course) relationship. And of course, you have the bad guys who are always one step ahead of the good guys, but then the good guys catch up, but then the bad guys catch on, etc., etc. This book was surprisingly hard to get into for a book of its genre. The first section jumped rapidly between characters and settings, and you never really felt like you were getting to know anyone or like anything resembling a story had started. Once the story did start to move, I was a little put off by some of the cliches. I will say, though, that the book tried to take an evenhanded look at the situation in the Middle East and express the victimization claims on both sides. Although there were clear good guys and bad guys among the book's characters, the book did a good job of complicating that distinction when it came to history and politics.So in that sense the book was perhaps a cut above, but overall, nothing special as far as I was concerned. People do seem to like this series, though, so I'm open to the possibility that the books improve over subsequent volumes."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17042835-tim", "userReview": "I've read more than half of the 14 in this series and decided to go to the beginning and get caught up in all.

Nothing grabbed me.The story was ok but several minor things bothered me, so I\u2019ll list them below.When I finished this I thought huh, the hero didn\u2019t do anything heroic and he did not solve the bad guy problem. The good action was done by another. Ok, but that kind of let me down - not much hero development here.Throughout the book the good guys were not doing smart things which made it less fun to root for them. In a few scenes the bad guys came out ahead due to luck. For example: the bad guy dresses as a waiter to get into a meeting of dignitaries. The front door guard let him in even though his name was not on the list - because the bad guy said they told me they needed extra staff. A guard let him into a private room because the bad guy said one of the top aids told me to bring this food. When the bad guy was in the kitchen, the boss of the waiters gave him work to do. The boss should have known who his employees were. He paid them. The boss did not even ask where he came from. This was too easy - using luck. I was disappointed the following was not shown. A woman was being trained as an agent. She was told to figure out who was following her. She reported three people and was wrong. Next time she reported three people and was right. I wanted to see what she saw and why she concluded what she did.Because a woman loved Gabriel she did amazing things for him. I wanted to see him reciprocate some kind of feeling for her, but he showed no feelings. That was a let down. It made him less sympathetic.Something unexpected was revealed at the end. It was quickly told. It was a neat surprise. The details behind that could have been a good story. Not required but I wanted to know more.I did not care for the narrator George Guidall. He made Gabriel the hero sound like a clerk or librarian. It didn\u2019t fit the sexy macho agent. And he made the bad guy sound wimpy. Other parts were ok, but overall his voice was not as good for me as other narrators.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person. Unabridged audiobook length: 11 hrs and 34 mins.

I got spoiled and after reading the best in the espionage genre this struck me as nothing more than a generic pulp thriller with all the writing skill, complexity of characterization and plotting of a blow'm up rat-tat-tat of a popcorn chomping action adventure flick.It doesn't help that in the first hundred or so pages Silva rotates the points of views so quickly. I didn't get invested enough in any character early on to really get hooked. This is supposedly the first in a series of novels about Gabriel Allon, an Israeli agent fighting terrorists. We're introduced to him only as \"the restorer\" and then as \"the stranger\" and it's quite a while before he's linked to Gabriel Allon who seems less a starring player as just one in an ensemble cast. His opponent \"Tariq\" is the usual cut-out cardboard Muslim terrorist--as quick to execute a lover or someone on his own side as the enemy and without remorse. The style is decent enough, but nothing in the novel raised this to anything memorable among the many \"dicklit\" thrillers that spend some time in the bestseller list."}, {"userName": "Karl Marberger", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58621278-karl-marberger", "userReview": "I\u2019ve heard good things about this series, and I was not disappointed.

The Kill Artist, the first in the Gabriel Allon Series was first published in 2000 and it is starting to feel its age. The story resolves around Israeli and Palestinian conflict. There is a cast of a \"villain\" and an \"anti-hero\" and retaliation is the word of the day. The plot feels tired. Granted, had I read it first in 2000, I may have not felt this way.As in many books that are the first in a series, the story starts of slowly as we are introduced to the characters. Despite my issues with a tired plotline, the characters are interesting. Our \"hero\" is a former Israeli intelligence officer who has retired and is working as a reclusive, world class art restorer. He finds himself (surprise, surprise) drawn back into action for the protection of Israel. He is an interesting and nuanced character.His sidekick / love interest/ former love interest / partner is an aging (ok. she is 33 but she says that she is old for her job) world class fashion model. She has also worked an Israeli agent using her \"assets\" to get information or put foreign diplomats in compromising positions.I was rather bored of the book by the halfway point. I only continued to read because the author has been highly recommended by multiple sources. The action picks up halfway through and zips on to a high finish leading a final  3.5  star rating.

A spy who restores masterpieces, who is out for revenge for his murdered family but doesn\u2019t really like to kill people. He\u2019s recruited from retirement by a ruthless Israeli agent who wants to stop an equally ruthless Palestinian terrorist. Ruthless is the key word here \u2013 everyone is ruthless. It\u2019s like a drinking game. The characters are flat, and there isn\u2019t anyone you can really feel emotionally invested in. And I\u2019ve said this before, but give me a villain I want to defeat soundly. The terrorists and agents in this story just depressed me. I didn\u2019t get the sense anyone was better off, or anything was much accomplished here \u2013 all the work and killing people just adds fuel to the fire of this conflict. I can\u2019t get behind that. And knowing Gabriel is just going to get pulled out of retirement again to fight some more of the same old baddies was just anti-climactic.

I had previously read the 16th book in the series, \u201cThe Black Widow\u201d, and enjoyed it very much. So much so that I went back to the beginning of the series. I am glad that I did not begin at the beginning.This novel is okay, not great. Unlike my previous experience while reading a book of Mr. Silva\u2019s I found I could easily put it down. That is not to say that I did not enjoy reading it, I did. Just that the experience was nothing spectacular.Mr. Silva is adept at not being needlessly one sided in this novel. There are clear good and bad guys, but he does give voice to the grievances that the Palestinian terrorists make. This was an interesting choice, as it does force the reader to realize that although one side may be a bit more moral than the other, there are still legitimate grievances on both sides of the issue.\u201cThe Kill Artist\u201d suffered from some \u201ctoo cute\u201d plot devices and some too easily wrapped up plot points, and from a ridiculous scene with Yasir Arafat and the main bad guy in the text, a terrorist named Tariq.

Os cen\u00e1rios de ac\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o diversos e desenrolam-se em grandes metr\u00f3poles.A escrita? \u00c9 simples e persuasiva, permitindo uma leitura r\u00e1pida. Os cap\u00edtulos s\u00e3o pequenos e permitem uma ac\u00e7\u00e3o constante.Conclus\u00e3o? N\u00e3o foi uma leitura que me atra\u00edsse muito mas fiquei com curiosidade para ler os pr\u00f3ximos, especialmente para ver o evoluir da personagem principal. Curiosidades? O livro tem uma cena que se desenrola na nossa capital, em que o Bairro Alto \u00e9 comparado a Beirute nos velhos tempos."}, {"userName": "Alex is The Romance Fox", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6663962-alex-is-the-romance-fox", "userReview": "This is the 1st book in the Gabriel Allon series by Daniel Silva.Gabriel Allon, former Israeli super spy/agent is now a restorer of old art masterpieces, living an isolated life in a remote English seaside village.

In this novel, readers are given a glimpse at the tragic backstory of Allon---his son was killed in a car bomb explosion meant for him, while his wife survived only to live in a vegetative coma-like state---and introduced to Allon\u2019s arch-nemesis, a Palestinian terrorist named Tariq.Among the other important characters are: ***Jacqueline Delacroix, a beautiful French supermodel who is also an Israeli spy. She uses her seductive charms and feminine wiles to help lure suspected or known terrorists into compromising positions for intel-gathering. During her last mission with Gabriel, the two became more intimate than their cover-identities required. Shortly after, Tariq\u2019s car-bomb killed Allon\u2019s son and left his wife a vegetable. She is conflicted: while she has tremendous guilt about what happened during the last mission, she can\u2019t help but still be in love with Allon.***Julian Isherwood, a British art dealer who has no illusions about the fact that he is getting older and the business is not as lucrative as it once was when he was younger. Allon is his most sought-after restorer, but he also knows that Allon\u2019s other life as a spy may drag him away from his studio work and thus ruin Isherwood.***Ari Shamron, a Mossad spymaster, recruited and trained Allon, his best agent. Allon is also his most troubled agent, for reasons that go beyond the fateful day involving Allon\u2019s wife and son. Shamron and Allon are as different as night and day: Allon loathes violence, while Shamron revels in it; Allon does not believe that everything that the Israeli government has done is for the best, while Shamron can not believe otherwise; Allon believes that revenge leads to spiritual death, while Shamron believes that revenge is a biblical necessity. Strangely, though, they make a superior team.The plot: When the Israeli ambassador to France is killed during a terrorist attack, Shamron clearly sees the calling card of the terrorist known as Tariq. He coaxes Allon back into the field with the promise of closure. Then, Shamron recruits Jacqueline to work with Allon. Sparks fly. Some of them are romantic ones.There is, as is to be expected from Silva, suspense and action galore in \u201cThe Kill Artist\u201d, but along with all of that is an even stronger thread of human drama. Silva creates believable, likable characters, and even his villains are sympathetic to an extent. They may do monstrous things, but they never come across as completely monstrous. They are simply broken people with irrational feelings of hatred and revenge."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1090620-ed", "userReview": "As the first book in the series, this effort does not measure up to later stories. This is understandable because Silva had to cover a lot of ground in order to set the series on its way. The later books in the series keep getting better and better.Gabriel Allon, the protagonist, is an art restorer, who at one time worked for a secret Israeli intelligence agency. He, in fact, was one of the assassins, Golda Meir dispatched to take revenge for the Munich Olympics massacre of Israeli athletes. Allon still has nightmares and regrets for what he did and has escaped into his art restoring career. Ari Shamron, his ex-boss and an obsessive protector of everything Israeli lures him back into the game by assigning him to stop a Palestinian zealot, Tariq, who is on one last mission. Allon cannot refuse because Tariq is responsible for killing his son and injuring his wife beyond repair. He is teamed with Jacqueline Delacroix a French fashion model who is also Jewish and has a history with Allon. The plot continues from there.In order to keep the plot moving, the characters are not as full as they become in later books. Silva, though, does a good job of presenting the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a basis for understanding Tariq's motivation. The plot has many twists in it to hold the reader's attention. There are times when it is not at all clear who is pursuing whom. Morality becomes a casualty, especially, when Shamron is involved, to say nothing of Tariq.I'm glad I had read subsequent books so that the faults of this first effort has not and will not keep me from reading every book in the series."}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2497528-alan", "userReview": "Sometimes I think I am so disconnected from my peers (i.e. other readers). I like spy movies, and have enjoyed some thriller/spy novels. So why does the first Gabriel Allon novel fall so short for me and not everyone else?For myself I know the answer. Two-dimensional characters at best, and with 420+ pages Silva should have done more than just do the small character development bits that he did. Yes, I get it that Gabriel is damaged for many reasons, but really none of them are explored. Especially the early depiction of a happy married life that was far from it (inferred from one sentence). It is obvious that Ari is an ass and Juliette loves Gabriel. We get it, because of the hammer over the head approach used to make these points.So art restorer Gabriel is lured back to Israel's intelligence service to track down and kill a terrorist. Yes, this is a very basic plot, but with good action, good character development, or good examples of trade craft this could be a good book. There is some of all three but too little of any and all to make me buy this book (it was borrowed from the library).Go watch USA network's Burn Notice and you'll get the same amount of trade craft or more. And, especially in the current season of Burn Notice you'll get a better example of the psychological damage this type of work does to an operative (as does Greg Rucka's Queen and Country books)."}, {"userName": "Filipe Miguel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5855795-filipe-miguel", "userReview": "Cometi o \"erro\" de come\u00e7ar a ler Daniel Silva pelo fim: \"Regras de Moscovo\" e a sua sequela: \"O Desertor\".S\u00f3 depois resolvi comprar os restantes livros da saga Allon para ler pela ordem correcta.Em compara\u00e7\u00e3o, e tendo lido duas das suas \u00faltimas obras e a primeira, considero o \"Artista da Morte\" bem menos conseguido.Presumo que a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o a esta nova personagem - Gabriel Allon -, tenha levado Silva a tentar uma abrang\u00eancia de temas que, no final, n\u00e3o cobriu como desejaria (conflito israelo-palestiniano, servi\u00e7os secretos, passado de Allon, arte, religi\u00e3o).Apesar de n\u00e3o serem obras-primas, os \u00faltimos dois livros concentram-se em menos t\u00f3picos e aprofundam-nos, enquanto que no primeiro, s\u00e3o apenas alvo de uma passagem r\u00e1pida.Seja como for, gostei bastante do \"Artista da Morte\", mas admito que ter lido primeiro os \u00faltimos possa ter dado algum cr\u00e9dito a Silva e ter-me levado a encarar esta introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de forma diferente daquela que far\u00e1 qualquer leitor que entre no \"novo\" mundo de Daniel Silva pelo... inicio.Ainda assim, n\u00e3o haja d\u00favidas (pelo menos para mim), a saga \"Gabriel Allon\", tal como a de \"Robert Langdon\" (Dan Brown), \u00e9 uma \"cereja\".

On the other hand, had I read this one first, I might not have found it compelling enough to get me to read on in the series. Silva's first Gabriel Allon book is enjoyable, but it is not a gripping page-turner. Some have compared Silva to John LeCarre. I think that's overstating the case. Silva is, at this point at least, a good, entertaining writer, but not one who has redefined the genre or set new levels of excellence in writing.

I found this a very good action/adventure book dealing with terrorists, counter-terrorists and the protagonist is an art restoration expert. The book is a bit dated since it was written a while back but the saga is quite engaging and moves us around the world quite deftly as a Palestinian terrorist tries to complete a mission and Israeli counter-terrorist Gabriel Allon tries to prevent it from happening. The books plot is driven by dialogue and we also get some background into this never ending cycle of hatred in the Middle East.

But when his wife and son fell victim to the danger that accompanied him everywhere, Gabriel quit and devoted himself to the work of art restoration, an occupation that had previously been a cover for his secret assignments. Now Ari Shamron, the head of Israeli intelligence, needs Gabriel's particular kind of experience to thwart a Palestinian plot to destroy the peace negotiations in the Middle East.
