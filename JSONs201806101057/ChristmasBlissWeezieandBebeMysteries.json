I won it on Goodreads, first-reads. I am am a struggling single mother who loves to read so getting books for free is always a plus. Even though it was an \"uncorrected bound manuscript\" with a lot of very glaring grammatical and format errors.This book is the follow up to \"Savannah Blues\" and \"Savannah Breeze\" and stars 2 characters that I feel are underdeveloped. It might be because I've only read \"Savannah Breeze\" and even then, that was a number of years ago. But the most developed characters were the ones surrounding BeBe and Weezie. For example, Harry or Cookie and Manny are more interesting characters in my opinion. Normally when I enjoy a book, I will finish it in a couple of days. I will read non-stop because I feel the characters are real and I want to know what happens next. Honestly, I didn't feel that sense of urgency with this book. I didn't really care about Weezie's wedding or when BeBe's baby would be born. Mostly because both of these events are entirely predictable. SPOILER ALERT: BeBe goes into labor right after Weezie gets married. How utterly convenient. Oh, and the man that BeBe is supposedly still married to? He's dead. Well that was wrapped up in a neat little bow. I feel like the author was trying to hurry up and get to the end of the book. There was one problem after another but no real detail or imagination in those problems. I'm glad everything worked out for the characters but it was a pretty boring book. If you like these characters, this book is definitely for you. If you want a little more creativity and imagination from an author, I suggest saving this one for another day."}, {"userName": "Mauoijenn ~ *Mouthy Jenn* ~", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2569271-mauoijenn-mouthy-jenn", "userReview": "Great addition to this series.

It features characters from her previous books, Savannah Blues and Savannah Breeze, therefore not really a stand alone novel. I would recommend reading these books first. There was some good humor and banter between main characters which I enjoyed. The narrative switches between two friends Bebe and Weezie from their POV every other chapter which was confusing. It would be better if it was written in the third person. Because the book has two story lines, Bebe's and Weezie's, none are developed to the full potential. Overall the book felt a little flat to me as there was not much happening or moving the plot along. The mystery of Bebe's first husband, Richard, when resolved was very disappointing and anti-climatic. It is an OK book and you might enjoy it if you read Savannah Breeze and Savannah Blues and wanted to revisit the characters but skip it if you have not read these books"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8410448-julie", "userReview": "Christmas Bliss by Mary Kay Andrews is a fun holiday-ish tale.\u00a0 It is not really about Christmas, but it is set in the weeks leading up to Weezie\u2019s Christmas wedding.\u00a0 While this is book four of an established mystery series, I found it easily readable as a standalone novel.\u00a0 It has Ms. Andrews\u2019 trademark southern setting and strong southern women who have to deal with outlandishly funny predicaments.\u00a0The story starts out less than blissfully.\u00a0 BeBe gets bad news from her ex-husband\u2019s lawyer, and from there the drama and comedy take off.\u00a0 From runaway pets, goofy construction workers,\u00a0overly enthusiastic wedding helpers to\u00a0a fianc\u00e9 photographed with a gorgeous, touchy woman while out of town on business, there is no end of things for Weezie and BeBe to deal with.\u00a0Weezie and BeBe\u00a0are great characters; they\u2019re strong, sassy, and charming.\u00a0 The plot is straight forward and well paced making Christmas Bliss a light-hearted read.\u00a0As a mystery, it wasn\u2019t particularly good, but as a lighthearted chick lit it was a very fun read.\u00a0 This charming read will delight readers whether or not they are fans of the Weezie and BeBe series.For more reading recommendations, visit Book Junkie Reviews: https://abookjunkiereviews.wordpress.com."}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1401819-dianne", "userReview": "While this book was another winner in the Weezie and Bebe series, I am shocked that an author such as this one could have so many continuity errors and other errors.

Why was Marion teetering on a chair on one page, and the next page has her climbing down a rickety ladder? The high cost of these e-books should mean that the consumer gets better editing.It is a good story but with so many things going on \u2013Bebe having her baby, Weezie and Danial\u2019s wedding and Weezie traveling to New York to see Daniel while he is the guest chef at a fancy restaurant \u2013it was just too much too much going on for one book. Two novellas would have been better. Then add in that Weezies father may be suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s and Bebe may still be a married woman (and have been a bigamist) and you have a buffet of story-lines.Naturally everything pretty much works out in the end and I (and I\u2019m probably the only one) think that there could and should be more books in this series.Yes this book needed a lot of work and editing to make it better, but it was a cozy and interesting holiday read nonetheless."}, {"userName": "Adrianna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5804518-adrianna", "userReview": "This was my very first book I've read my Mary Kay Andrews and I really liked it.

I feel like you could totally read it without the other three, but I'm excited to add the previous ones to my TBR. I feel in love with Weezie and BeBe, their friendship is amazing!!

I kept waiting for something to go terribly wrong; there seems to be always the unexpected occurrence, but this book wraps up nice and tidy, as I suppose most of her books do. Unexpected things do occur in this book, but do not affect the end all outcome. My heart was rapidly beating in several situations, like the blizzard during the surprise trip to New York taken a few days before the wedding, discovering that the divorce did not go through and the fishing trip that ends in the calling of the coast guard. I was made to feel involved in the lives of the women because I could so closely relate to them.

There are three other novels featuring these two characters; perhaps if I had that series connection, I would have enjoyed this novel more, but as a stand-alone, this one just didn\u2019t hold my interest. I kind of felt like I needed Rudolph to help me find that little something to keep me reading. In the beginning, I figured the suspense might come in the form of a cheating fianc\u00e9. When Weezie spots a tabloid photo of her husband-to-be draped by his glamorous boss at New York event in his honor, she drops everything and whisks away to the Big Apple. At that point, I thought (hoped) that she might find a conniving, big city woman wooing her man. Alas, not so. For the majority of the novel, we simply follow her solitary forays into the city, including her cheesy run in with a bearded man dressed head to toe in red and wearing black boots. BeBe had a bit more drama when she discovered her divorce from her horrible former husband was never filed. However, that storyline ended quickly, leaving only the mystery of her child\u2019s birth, which also seemed a bit clich\u00e9. A Christmas baby? How many movies feature that same event? I will say the novel is well-written if not somewhat overwhelming with the descriptions of antiques, scenery, and designers, but sadly, I simply couldn\u2019t connect with the characters.

I have adored the characters of Weezie and BeBe from the first book in the series, and this book is no exception. The story takes place around Christmas but the holiday is background to the two main story lines, one focusing on Weezie and one focusing on Bebe. There is plenty of the interaction between them that make these books work so well and a touch of the holiday fills the air.What could be more wonderful than the joy of Christmas, the excitement of preparing for a wedding, and the thrill of an impending birth! Everything is perfect,...well, there are a couple of issues to put a damper on the season like that divorce thing that just might not have happened, maybe. There is that newspaper picture of Daniel with the hot Italian restaurant owner in New York City. That doesn't exactly make Weezie's day. The trials and tribulation are expected in a book by MKA, but the path is never quite the one we expect her to take. There is enough of the predictable for comfort, but this is not that wedding catastophe book your have read a dozen times. It is a truly lovely story about four people that we already care about.While you would be fine reading it as a standalone, the richness of the characters is developed through the series.

It read like a novella, and was only boosted to a little more volume by the fact that there were both Bebe's and Weezie's stories/POVs included. I liked the little details included about Weezie's and Bebe's businesses, but I could have done without the unnecessary sneaking around and angsting on both of their parts. Their actions seem so juvenile for such otherwise mature, intelligent women. Why on earth wouldn't Bebe just TELL Harry what was going on? And Weezie, disregarding all she knows about her fiancee, still sees red when she catches sight of the newspaper clipping? Meh. The Christmas in New York scene seemed awfully romantic but having visited myself just before Christmas, I couldn't believe Weezie wouldn't have been turned off by the godawful crush of tourists (in-state, out-of-state, and foreign) crowding the streets so tightly you can't even turn around.

BeBe Loudermilk is a very pregnant confident woman with an older but kind-hearted and loving partner Harry, a charter fishing boat captain. There are bumps in the road as they get closer to the wedding date (and BeBe's due date), which is scheduled to take place at Christmas. The wedding is supposed to be a small elegant affair, but Weezie leaves her wonderful gay friends in charge, and they go a little over the top with arrangements.
