Her uncharitable hypothesis is that Munro is too lazy to do the necessary work; she'd rather just scribble down each idea in short story form and then move on to the next one. Other people criticize her for being \"cerebral\" or \"contrived\". I don't agree with any of this, but I can see where the accusations are coming from. After some thought, I find a metaphor which sums up my own feelings. It's true that a Munro story can seem just a little too perfect. Everything fits together so elegantly; there is nothing wasted. A non-chessplayer might compare it to a chess game. But for someone who does play chess, the image doesn't work. A normal chess game is like a novel. It's a story with a beginning, a middle and an end, where things often go in unexpected directions and painfully have to be put back on track. Novelists can never quite control their characters (Proust somehow ended up putting in a couple more books than he had originally intended), and chessplayers have an even harder time controlling their pieces. There is a small group of people in the chess world, however, who do something which feels more rewarding to them than playing games; they compose endgame studies. A study is a chess idea expressed in its purest form. Every piece is necessary, and there is only one sequence of moves that achieves the desired result, given best defence. If White's task is to win, then he has only one way to win, and if it is to draw, then he only has one way to draw. The composer has a key position in mind, which possesses some unusual or beautiful property. At first, the arrangement of the pieces appears pointless; but finally the solver realizes that in just this case a knight is worth more than a queen, or the king finds itself miraculously stalemated in the middle of the board, and they see what the composer is doing.A Munro story feels to me rather like a study. There is a small group of people and a set of relationships between them. Nothing seems out of the ordinary. But somehow, as the story unfolds, a logical but completely unexpected scene arises. A woman with psychic powers, baking little dough mice in an institution; or a child, with a winter coat over her pyjamas, standing shivering in a snowdrift and helping scatter ashes. You suddenly understand that this is what the story was about.Very few chessplayers are able to create worthwhile studies. I think Munro's gift is similar, and just as rare."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "As seen on The ReadventurerLike many readers, I claim quite often that I am not really a fan of short stories, that is, I claim that until I come across the next good short story collection, like Alice Munro's Runaway. My imaginary dislike for shorts can surely be traced to reading too many poorly assembled multi-author anthologies. There are maybe two of them in existence that I can honestly call good. From my experience, single-author collections are much, much more satisfying.Once again, I have a podcast to thank for discovering a new great author - this time, The New Yorker fiction podcast. The moment I finished listening to Munro's \"Axis,\" I went straight to my digital public library to download me more of her stories.What Alice Munro's stories remind me the most of are the works of another fabulous Canadian writer - Margaret Atwood, particularly The Blind Assassin and Cat's Eye. (Maybe Canadian books, similar to Australian, have a specific regional \"flavor\"? I am starting to believe they do, Canadian fiction tends to evokes feelings of cold, emptiness, spaciousness and loneliness in me.) Munro's stories have the same structure, they are told through a prism of many years past, usually by a mature female narrator, who looks back in time and recollects a specific experience of her youth that changed the whole course of her life. The stories are told from a position of maturity and understanding, but with a feeling of a mild regret. In the present, decades later, those life-turning events do not sting as much as they used to, but the narrator knows unequivocally, they have changed EVERYTHING. These events that Munro writes so beautifully about, can be quite trivial on the surface (like going on a wild car ride with one's passionless fiance's brother or being momentarily rude to an annoying passenger on a train) or traumatizing (appearance of a strange woman in a child's life who makes the strangest insinuations about the child's birth), but whatever these events are, they affect the narrator in a major way.Munro's prose is deceptively simple and straightforward, but what she achieves with it is tremendous. Her fame as one of finest short story writers is well deserved."}, {"userName": "brian   ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian", "userReview": "in 1997, the reigning king of redonda, a tiny island & micronation in the bahamas, was so moved by superstar spanish writer javier marias's novel todas las almas that he abdicated the throne and handed it to marias. weird shit. so marias confers the title of 'duke' and 'duchess' to certain people, amongst them: john ashbery (duke of convexo)pedro almodovar (duke of tr\u00e9mula)frank gehry (duke of nervi\u00f3n)w.g. sebald (duke of v\u00e9rtigo)guillermo cabrera infante (duke of tigres)every year all the dukes and duchesses come together and vote for one person to receive a duchy. in 2005 they voted to cast amongst their ranks:alice munro (duchess of ontario)an island run by a spanish writer and a whole team of supercool artist royalty? i'm gonna ditch the by-now-boring united states of america and become redonda's only inhabitant. here're my theories as to why redonda's royalty, most other writers, and lotsa readers have a huge boner for alice munro:1. a) she's an old lady. b) she's canadian. c) she's a badass. anyone who's alive in the world understands a few things:a \u2260 c & b \u2260 c. but somehow, in this instance: a + b = c. this has gotta rattle the shit outta some people. 2. she bypasses all the tricks* lotsa contemporary writers employ** in order to tease out human behavior and all those lofty writery themes -- munro just sets it in motion and gets to the core quicker and with more poignancy than most others. contemporary writers who feel all the oldies peering over their shoulders & feel like they gotta do something new! & different! to distinguish themselves must secretly loathe munro for just spinning a yarn filled with more of the good shit than they pack into their stories of monsters-of-mud and comic books and hebraic constables etc. 3. y'know how francis ford coppola (the duke of megal\u00f3polis. seriously.) elevated the doings of scuzzy gangsters to the level of olympian gods? well, alice munro manages to pull a variation of this with totally ordinary people. it's even more impressive, really: she manages to pull the 'elevate to olympian god' thing while simultaneously keeping her stories small and creaky and specific. 4. it's 1983 and i'm laying on my back in the #6 school library while mrs. greene reads to us with her cracky old-woman's voice... i close my eyes and take in that dusty book smell and just get totally lost in the world of a great story. munro does this for adults. her stories are what stories meant to us when we were kids. 5. this book is not one of her strongest. but, paraphrasing woody allen on orgasms: the worst one is right on the money, the 'worst' is still pretty great. 6. \"alice munro is our chekhov\" - cynthia ozick* yes, yes. realism and straightforward storytelling is a 'trick', another mode of storytelling as artificial as any type of formalism. blahblahblah. you know exfuckingactly what i mean here. ** occasionally munro employs those o. henryesque endings. these are amongst her weakest stories."}, {"userName": "Jo\u00e3o Carlos", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17544299-jo-o-carlos", "userReview": "O realizador espanhol Pedro Almodovar adaptou ao cinema os contos Acaso, Em Breve e Sil\u00eancio - com Juliet como protagonista.Adoro contos...A escritora canadiana Alice Munro (n. 1931) \u2013 de quem li recentemente \u201dO Progresso do Amor\u201d (1985 - 1986) - 4*, Falsos Segredos (1994) - 5* e \u201d\u00d3dio, Amizade, Namoro, Amor, Casamento\u201d (2001) - 4* - Pr\u00e9mio Nobel da Literatura em 2013 \u00e9 uma \u201cespecialista\u201d na narrativa curta, reconhecida e aclamada como um \u201dmestre do conto contempor\u00e2neo\u201d, apenas com um \u00fanico romance publicado em 1971,\u201dVidas de Raparigas e Mulheres\u201d. \u201dFugas\u201d (2004) \u00e9 mais uma deslumbrante colect\u00e2nea de oito contos \u2013 sobre mulheres \u201creais\u201d, nos seus sentimentos e na sua complexidade emocional, de todas as idades, de todas as classes sociais, de todos os n\u00edveis de instru\u00e7\u00e3o acad\u00e9mica \u2013 com descri\u00e7\u00f5es profundas, impregnadas de sequ\u00eancias simb\u00f3licas, com reflex\u00f5es sociol\u00f3gicas e filos\u00f3ficas absorventes.

Jonathan Franzen said about this book in the NY Times Book Review:Basically, Runaway is so good that I don't want to talk about it here. Quotation can't do the book justice, and neither can synopsis. The way to do it justice is to read it.But here's what Michiko Kakutani says about it in the NY Times:Instead of assuming the organic, musical form of real life, they feel like self-conscious, overworked tales, relying on awkwardly withheld secrets and O'Henryesque twists to create narrative suspense. EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNG. WRONG.Franzen's right. Just read it. It's good. It's not THAT good, it's too simple and straightforward to really rock your world on a spiritual level, but it's really really good. Her stories are long (sometimes a bit too) and have a ton of emotional weight, which a lot of these tricky young writers seem to forget to include in the name of fun. No tricks here. Just good stories.

Too often the nuance overshadows character and plot development, as if the author is cruelly trying to offer the reader a tiny taste of a story before yanking it away again. No so with Alice Munro. She writes with such simplicity and economy and mystery. The mystery arises from the way that she presents each story--just a few words at the outset, perfectly descriptive, but never overly so. And then the rest of it is just like (**alert**be prepared for tired metaphors) unwrapping a gift or watching a flower bloom in those sped-up photos. Except, of course, that these flowers bloom tantalizingly slowly as the story unfolds.There's such a range of human situations that Ms. Munro considers in Runaway, all of them complicated, most painful, some almost humorous, and many of them frustrating. This is much like life, I guess. Deeply imperfect and driven by chance and misunderstanding and weakness. And yet the way that she presents life makes me feel as if every bit of it is just exactly as it should be."}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1207684-bruce", "userReview": "This 2004 collection of eight stories by the Nobel Prize winning Canadian short story writer wonderfully demonstrates her narrative flair, the careful construction of her stories, and her psychological sensitivity and perception. As is characteristic of her work, the stories here feature women navigating the shoals of familial constraints, transitions, and, to use an overused term, dysfunctions. Munro works with an economy of language, conjuring moods and shifts of meaning, the subtleties of relationships and the ambiguities of love, with acuteness, with a degree of sympathy and understanding, and yet with a toughness that will not let the reader avoid seeing and accepting facts and situations that are anything but happily-ever-after.The first and title story in the collection is aptly named. The young woman Carla has run away from home with a slick smooth talker and finds herself isolated with a controlling man, the two of them struggling to make a living running a horseback riding school. At the instigation of a neighbor, Carla runs away from him, only to succumb to a fit of anxiety that leads her back to the \u201cranch\u201d and a life that requires her to overlook his manipulations.The second, third, and fourth stories all feature Juliet at different ages in her life, one dealing with her having struck out on her own and finding a man with whom to throw in her lot, one dealing years later with her return with her young daughter to visit her parents, and the last as a widow dealing the her own abandonment by her daughter. In \u201cPassion,\u201d the twenty-year-old Grace, a high school graduate working away from home as a waitress, drifts into a relationship with an upper middle class family, passively allowing her life to unfold before her before taking an irrevocable step that alters everything. Beneath the conventionality of the story and Grace\u2019s life is a sense of tension and inevitability, haunting premonitions of disaster that will alter the course of her life in ways that she perhaps desires.The antepenultimate story, \u201cTrespasses,\u201d is about a high school girl, an only child of liberal parents, who discovers secrets about her own birth and her parents\u2019 past lives that go beyond the stereotypical \u201cWas I adopted?\u201d clich\u00e9. The nuances of Lauren\u2019s wonderings, suspicions, and misunderstandings are clearly wrought, as is the unexpected ending.\u201cTricks\u201d is the story that moved me most, a story of a young nurse living thirty miles from Stratford in Canada, caring for her asthmatic sister but taking the time each year to treat herself to a Shakespeare play on a day\u2019s outing. While there one year she meets a man, a Montenegro clock repairman. They arrange to meet again the following year. She returns to see As You Like It, but her meeting with Danilo does not occur. Years later, she learns why. I was touched by this story, about its exploration of complex feelings, about its stoic acceptance of the impossibility of living life over again, of missteps taken and opportunities missed.The final story, \u201cPower,\u201d is also the longest, the tracing of a life over half a century, ending with a time for reflecting on the vicissitudes of existence, on the consequences of roads not taken, on the way in which people misunderstand each other and choose to create each other in images other than who they really are. It is the story of aging and what it means for a life to be drawing to a close, about what it means when one realizes that there is more past to one\u2019s life than future, about the dawning awareness that there is much about one\u2019s life that one cannot understand, now or ever.The excellence of Munro\u2019s stories must be acknowledged, and I think her Nobel Prize is richly deserved. That having been said, her stories do seem to have a sameness of tone or ambiance, a typical somberness of theme and treatment that make the reader able to identify them even without the direct knowledge of her authorship. There are authors who seem to have a wider range of mastery in terms of theme and treatment than does Munro, or at least a wider range of interest. She might be described as a miniaturist, an artist excelling in depth rather than breadth, her skill undeniable. I find her work to be most satisfying when I read a single story in isolation, allowing days and even weeks to elapse before reading another, her work being less rewarding or at least less moving when a collection is read straight through. I recommend her work highly and am pleased that it has been recognized by the Nobel Committee."}, {"userName": "Cemre", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11693335-cemre", "userReview": "Alice Munro'yu \u00e7ok seviyorum.

I listened to the book, and really liked it, though I am a white middle-class, late-middle-aged man, and this book features white middle-class Canadian (particularly from Ontario) women, many of them late-middle aged. The focus is on stories of women and girls, on relationships, sometimes with men, and the every day, in every day language. They are unfussy, unpretentious, realistic literary fiction. I initially had to slow down to appreciate the style, as it is so elegant and understated, and then I found myself hooked.We have stories here of mothers estranged from their daughters, of lonely women hoping for passion of some kind, stories of aging, stories of ordinary grief and madness. I think my two favorite stories are the opening, title story, \u201cRunaway,\u201d and the closing story, \u201cPowers.\u201d In \u201cRunaway,\u201da young woman confides in a neighbor about her unhappy marriage, and the older woman assists in helping her escape to Toronto. Here\u2019s a passage from the woman as she rides on the bus:\u201cShe could not picture it. Herself riding on the subway or streetcar, caring for new horses, talking to new people, living among hordes of people every day who were not Clark.A life, a place, chosen for that specific reason\u2013\u2013that it would not contain Clark.The strange and terrible thing coming clear to her about that world of the future, as she now pictured it, was that she would not exist there. She would only walk around, and open her mouth and speak, and do this and do that. She would not really be there. And what was strange about it was that she was doing all this, she was riding on this bus in the hope of recovering herself. As Mrs. Jamieson might say\u2013\u2013and as she herself might with satisfaction have said\u2013\u2013taking charge of her own life. With nobody glowering over her, nobody's mood infecting her with misery.But what would she care about? How would she know that she was alive?While she was running away from him\u2013\u2013now\u2013\u2013Clark still kept his place in her life. But when she was finished running away, when she just went on, what would she put in his place? What else\u2013\u2013who else\u2013\u2013could ever be so vivid a challenge?\u201dThe story is ultimately powerfully sad; we know this woman; she is our neighbor, she cannot do the thing she needs to do.\"Powers,\" the eighth and final story in the collection, is divided into five parts, featuring a woman, Nancy, who imagines greatness for herself but ends up marrying a guy, Wilff, she has little affection for. Oops, Nancy, so much for greatness! As she is preparing for her wedding, Nancy meets a woman with psychic powers, Tessa. At one point Tessa correctly identifies all of the items in a guy named Ollie's pockets. Ollie soon marries (the remarkable and fascinating) Tessa (!!) and they actually get involved in a Vaudeville act showcasing Tessa\u2019s abilities. But in a later part of the story, Nancy visits Tessa in a mental hospital, where she has received electroshock treatment and can\u2019t recall her past with Ollie, whom she expects has died. In another part Nancy meets Ollie, who tells her Tessa had died. Nancy doesn\u2019t contradict Ollie. As a much older woman, Nancy dreams of Tessa and Ollie. This story has the most remarkable character, Tessa, I guess, but it is, like all the other stories, also about ordinary people living lives of quiet desperation.

I know I cannot expect you to understand this.\u201dThat was Carla's note to her parents when she ran away with Clark, a no-good drifter, as her stepfather called him. She says he saved up the money for a farm, so he can\u2019t be all bad. But he IS temperamental.\u201cClark often had fights, and not just with the people he owed money to. His friendliness, compelling at first, could suddenly turn sour. There were places in town that he would not go into, because of some row.\u201dCarla and Clark run a small riding school with very few clients and horses, and things are tight. They live in a mobile home which she keeps trying to fix up. She works a bit for an older, well-to-do university couple nearby. Sylvia, the wife, is now a widow and has returned after a holiday in Greece. She compares Carla to to her students, the college girls who hang on her every word. That\u2019s not Carla. Carla reminds her more of some girls she knew in high school, \u201cbuoyant but not rambunctious. Naturally happy.\u201d (Dare I say \u201cauthentic\u201d?)We know that Carla has made up some stories and is just a big kid in many ways. She often escapes to the barn to do what I suppose she thinks of as \u201cauthentic\u201d work, mucking out stables, while Clark juggles the bills and the books and real life. He has good reason to be irritable, but she\u2019s unhappy and getting itchy feet again. She's also nervous about the consequences of her tall tales.Lonely Sylvia tries to sit Carla down to talk (and talk and talk) about how wonderful Greece was, staying in a tiny village with nothing to do but go for walks. (More of that wonderfully simple, authentic life.) Her influence on unhappy, naive Carla has dramatic repercussions. Alongside Carla\u2019s escapades are those of a very small goat, Flora, who disappears, reappears, disappears. She starts off as company for the horses, but seems to represent more.It's an interesting study of power and control. Oh, yes, and \"authenticity\". How could I forget the universal hankering for the romance of the simple life?

The idea of \"running away\" or \"escape\" permeates each tale. And what to make of the fact that the book consists of clipped, one-word titles? Intriguing.I love the linked sequence of three narratives (\"Chance,\" \"Soon,\" and \"Silence\"), and if you read carefully you'll see each of those words is repeated significantly in other stories, especially \"chance.\" (Think of the chain of events in \"Tricks,\" the sudden swerve in the plot in \"Passion,\" another word that resonates throughout the book.)There are echoes of previous Munro stories here: the two sisters from \"Tricks\" and \"Powers\" recall those in \"The Peace Of Utrecht\" and \"Something I've Been Meaning To Tell You\"; Juliet's journalism career recalls Rose's career in Who Do You Think You Are/The Beggar Maid; there's a spooky feel in the title story that reminds me a bit of \"Save The Reaper\"; the hapless husbands or husbands-to-be in \"Passion\" and \"Powers\" recall previous ones like Patrick Blatchford.Of course Munro once again sees everything about her characters and compresses entire lives into a couple dozen pages. The scope of the final story, \"Powers,\" is astonishing, as is the protagonist's hard-to-read motivations.I'll definitely revisit these stories later, especially \"Passion,\" one of her best, and \"Runaway,\" one of her most mysterious.If there were half stars I'd give this 4 1/2. But I'm rounding up, because, well, she's one of the best writers in the world.**Here's my review of 2009's Too Much Happiness:http://www.nowtoronto.com/daily/story..."}, {"userName": "Simona", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6222130-simona", "userReview": "La Munro continua a mostrare le sue abilit\u00e0 di scrittrice anche in questa ennesima raccolta di racconti. Nelle parole, nelle emozioni di questa scrittrice canadese tutto \u00e8 dove dovrebbe essere. Nulla \u00e8 lasciato al caso, tutto \u00e8 studiato e raccontato nei minimi dettagli.In questi racconti si narra di donne in fuga, donne in fuga da se stesse, dai loro bisogni, dal destino che si accanisce contro di loro. Sono donne che, nonostante tutto, non rinunciano a se stesse e a ci\u00f2 che sono, grazie anche a degli scorci intimisti e meravigliosi di un Canada che la Munro dipinge come fosse un quadro. Per la prima volta nei racconti della scrittrice, si incorpora un trittico che comprende lo stesso personaggio Juliet (\"Fatalit\u00e0\", \"Fra poco\", \"Silenzio\"), che attraversa le fasi della vita, come madre, donna e figlia. Ogni storia \u00e8 un mosaico in cui queste donne nascono, crescono e giungono a noi sotto forma di poesia."}, {"userName": "Vonia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia", "userReview": "I do not usually prefer short stories, but Alice Munro's \"Runaway\" is an exception. Munro's work as a whole, in fact. Everybody knows that short stories are more difficult to perfect than the novel, thus the lack of well-written ones. What makes her sorry stories stand out? One notable difference is that Munro's short stories are actually not that short. Strictly in words, many lean towards the lengthier \"definition\". (Short stories are not defined by length as much as structure. Although there's is no official demarcation for length, the range has been loosely defined at 1 to 20 thousand words, and that it can be read in an hour at the most; shorter than a novel [typically 80 to 100 thousand words]). Moreover, her readers will quickly realize that they are quite similar to novels in the feeling and immersing story they offer. Munro's stories have the scope of a novel, but without any obvious speeding up or trimming. How exactly she does this is arguable an art. Two, I love that the same theme- sometimes obvious, other times more difficult to decipher- runs through the entire book, further creating the feeling for a cohesive novel rather than sorry stories. (For example, this collection. Each of the protagonists is running from something; hiding, escaping, trying to find themselves. Runaway emotions, running from the truth, literally running away from their residences. A feeling of loneliness in a room full of others, of needing to overcome much despite outward appearances of needing nothing. Multiple interpretations for the title word, from slang to straightforward, are used throughout.) Thirdly, All the stories are from a female protagonist's point of view (\"Powers\" lends a portion to a male point of view). They all go through something significant during the narration; they all change, though not always in a positive way. For many, this change is a life-altering one. Munro's collection of the same title, concerns two runaways: \"Carla, whose abusive husband, Clark, inspires her to run away, and Sylvia, her neighbor who encourages Carla's runaway attempt. Sylvia's husband has passed away, and she comes to rely on Carla for help around her house and develops an obsessive concern for her abused friend. Sylvia's friends describe her affection for Carla as a crush. While Carla resents Clark's abuse, it seems apparent that without Sylvia's planning and urging she would not have taken a bus out of town, only to get off the bus and call Clark to come and get her. Significantly, Carla, who is wearing some of Sylvia's clothes, decides that the clothes do not \u201cfit\u201d her.Sylvia, who later moves to an apartment in town, also may be considered a runaway. Besides the two women, there is another runaway: Flora, Carla's pet goat, who mysteriously vanishes and returns in supernatural fashion when Clark threatens Sylvia physically. The goat's sudden appearance saves Sylvia, and then Flora again vanishes. After Carla returns to Clark, she finds Flora's bones in the woods. She speculates about how Flora died and then absolves Clark of any guilt\u2014something she has to do if she is to go on living with him. In effect, she runs away from the truth; Flora's fate could become hers.\" There next three chapters are actually about the same characters, with tears in between. This circumvents the loose definitions for short stories actually, (perhaps purposely). \"We meet Juliet first as a studious young teacher, then as a young mother visiting her elderly parents, and finally as a late middle-aged woman sundered from her own grown-up daughter. It turns out that the independence and rationalism we have admired in Juliet have alienated her child, who has left in search of the spiritual things she never had at home.\" \"In \"Tricks\", Robin, a young nurse who goes off by herself each year to see a Shakespeare play at Stratford, Ontario, is caught up in, and caught out by, a bit of plotting as artificial as a Shakespearean comedy. What if, Munro seems to say, the romantic susceptibilities of an inexperienced young woman were to be exposed to the comic doublings of a Twelfth Night or The Comedy of Errors. Another illustration of Munro's scope, this reminded me of O. Henry's \" The Gift of the Magi\", but covering an adult lifetime rather than one Christmas, the confusion of identity sorted out, not at the end of the evening, but a whole adult lifetime later. As exceedingly frustrating and small chances of actually happening, but certainly believable, it was actually my favorite. \"Trespasses\" is similar, an examination of finding out unknown identities, a frustrating coincidence with a narrow possibility of occurring but definitely believable; a life-changing, both fortunate and unfortunate (depending in one's philosophy of \"ignorance is bliss\") happenstance for all the characters involved. \"Powers,\" the eighth and final story in the collection, is divided into five parts. (Interesting to consider it as an example of Freytag's pyramid theory). The first part comprises the diaries of Nancy, a self-centered young woman convinced that she is destined to have some great importance. She startles the town doctor, Wilf, on April Fool's Day by pretending to have a terminal illness; when she later tries to apologize to him, he unexpectedly proposes to her. Nancy, ashamed of her conduct, accepts his proposal although she feels little affection for him. She expresses surprise that her life has proved so mundane after all.The second part shifts into third-person narration and takes place several months after the first part. Nancy and Wilf are engaged and preparing for their wedding. Wilf's cousin Ollie is in town to attend the ceremony, and Nancy becomes fascinated by his worldly affectations. In an attempt to impress him, she takes Ollie to visit Tessa, a friend of hers that lives on the outskirts of town. Tessa has psychic abilities that allow her to see through objects; she correctly identifies all of the items in Ollie's pockets. Ollie seemingly dismisses her, but Nancy fears that he is hiding a deeper interest. She writes Tessa, warning her to avoid Ollie. Tessa responds, revealing that she and Ollie have already eloped to the United States. They intend to get married and test her abilities scientifically. Nancy is now an aging woman visiting an American mental hospital. The facility is shutting down, but she has received a letter asking that Nancy retrieve Tessa, who has lived there for some time. Nancy has no intention of doing so, and she arranges with the management to leave alone after she has spoken with Tessa. When the two former friends meet, Nancy attempts to learn about Ollie and his life with Tessa. Tessa, however, cannot remember anything; electroshock therapy has ruined her memory. She claims that Ollie may have hanged himself, and that it wasn't his fault, but she recalls nothing else. Tessa then guesses that Nancy plans to abandon her at the facility. Feeling guilty, Nancy promises to write her after she leaves, although she never does.The fourth part moves forward a few more years. Wilf has died from the complications of a stroke, and Nancy takes the opportunity to travel. She is in a large city when she randomly encounters Ollie. She and Ollie have a long discussion, in which he discusses his travels with Tessa in the United States. He says that funding for research disappeared after World War II, forcing he and Tessa to work on the vaudeville circuit. The strain of performing gave Tessa horrible headaches and gradually eroded her powers, but she and he developed an intricate system with which to deceive their audiences. Eventually, Ollie says, Tessa died. Nancy does not contradict him; she instead asks him to walk her to his hotel. (One of those things I have always had a difficult time understanding, as personally I always prefer the truth, no matter how painful; I am opposed to the \"ignorance is bliss\" theory.) Upon arriving, however, Ollie refuses to go up to her room. Nancy, shamed by his honesty, resolves to find Tessa again. She does not succeed. The fifth part takes place decades later. Nancy has become a very old woman, whose children worry that she is living in the past. Munro is considered a national treasure in Canada. She had received both the Man Booker International and Nobel Prize in literature in recent years, among other accolades.

Whatever there is to say about her genius, and there's a lot, we have to say, of all the instruments she commands as a writer, *structure* is the one with which she is most masterful. This is how she's a realist--not because all the people in her stories wear pants (when appropriate) and none have nipples that light up like flashlights on touch, but because meaning and significance and trajectory gather as if on their own powers, through the accumulation of pieces and the order in which they arrive. The stories gather together. They are plotted in the most Aristotelian way, in which plot is \"the arrangement of incidents.\" Munro says that if, in drafting, \"I feel a part that's wrong [...] I pay attention to the story as it were really happening somewhere, not just in my head, and in its own way, not mine.\"I've also read Munro saying that she conceives of a short story--and she's talking here about her experience as a reader--\"not as if it were a road, taking me somewhere, with views and neat diversions along the way [...]. It's more like a house. Everybody knows what a house does, how it encloses space and makes connections between one enclosed space and another and presents what is outside in a new way.\"That's what makes these stories so pleasurable--they open up to the reader, they reveal rooms and nooks and corners and turns and staircases as you make your way inside. They're never interested in forcing you or controlling you (though of course they are). They surprise you like life does, in messy, hilarious, uncanny ways. How one piece fits to the previous is part of the meaning. The form conveys emotional content. (Isn't it so interesting she doesn't write novels? It suggests to me that that the magic of her stories requires a limited span, an impending end; too much space and they become jumbled, unclear, diffuse.)While  Runaway  isn't as good as  Too Much Happiness , it is still Munro."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "If you need someone to sell you on short stories, go to Alice Munro. Her writing is straightforward and easy to grasp, yet it still conveys a wide range of striking and subtle emotions. In Runaway, most of the stories involve a middle-aged woman reflecting on her past and how an event has affected her life. The premise of each story appears simple - a woman has a passionate love affair with a married man, a daughter fails to comfort her mom - which allows Munro to weave in truths about human relationships through her plain prose. These short stories stick to the longer side, but Munro wields every word to make memorable moments and connections between and within her characters.Recommended for those who want a solid collection of short stories about human relationships, as well as for those who desire some Canadian literature. I read a couple of stories from Runaway every week and discussed them with a friend, which let me savor Munro's prose and her penchant for subtlety that says a lot."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1658299-jane", "userReview": "I didn't realize this was a book of short stories when I bought it.

And until recently I wasn't aware that I share this dislike with a pretty significant amount of people\u2026I've been seeing around Goodreads how common it is for people who read novels not to like short stories. It would be interesting to know if the reasons for that distaste are all similar, at the core.So, I started this book with an open mind. I was excited to read it, knowing after all, that Alice Munro is a Nobel Laureate from 2013 and that her fan base consists of a lot of friends and readers who's opinions I value. I've heard a lot of good things, seen the book fairly often, read good reviews. I was happy to find it at the dollar bookstore and I started it pretty soon after I bought it. The first story is the title story, Runaway, and I actually really liked the first story. It spoke to me. The story was about a young girl caught in a dangerously volatile relationship, with a husband who has consistently been hovering on the brink of a blow up and the neighbor who tries to help her but who is ultimately refused when the girl is in the end unable to take the opportunity to escape her situation. It's the all too familiar situation with the all too familiar issues. A young girl enamored with the rebel. The rebel turned into the inevitable middle aged, unemployable, angry and abusive man. The girl who claims she wants out but is just too afraid yet refuses chance after chance to actually escape. The psychological hold that men sometimes hold over scared women. The oh so typical girl on girl crush, that is dismissed even in the story as something that always happens at some time or another. And then the matter of choosing ignorance. THIS was the part that reached out to me: A person's ability to refrain from acknowledging truths. This issue was especially interesting for me, and so the story became that much more interesting to me. It's always been something that baffles me, something that I've pondered endlessly. One of my random but consistent ruminations. How can somebody choose to ignore something? How can one convince themselves to not know something that they actually know? How can somebody know the truth in their heart of hearts, but yet somehow manage to find a way to block that knowledge? I've never been that sort of person, the opposite actually. And I've always considered those people who do have that ability to pick and choose what they believe and block out what they don't want to believe to have an inordinate amount of self control. And we see this type of willpower and mental compartmentalizing with Carla. She refers to a truth that she's actively blocking out as \"It was as if she had a murderous needle somewhere in her lungs, and by breathing carefully she could avoid feeling it. But every once in awhile she had to take a deep breathe, and it was still there.\" Oh, I loved that quote. Who of us doesn't know exactly what that feels like? Whether that needle be that certain truth you want to deny -the whiff of something that smells oddly like perfume on your husband after a late evening at work, the strange charges on the credit card, the phone calls taken in the other room\u2026 or some other potential acknowledgement you're trying to get out of facing-the clues telling you your kid has a problem, the somehow-different-ness that tells you your bf/gf is pulling away, the bill collectors beeping in on phone calls, whatever. Even something like the ex you're trying to forget, the heartbreak you're trying to get over. It's all the same. Just as Munro said, a murderous needle that most of the time you can ignore. But every once in awhile\u2026So I loved Runaway. Mainly for that whole theme, because I can relate. BUT. The best story came first. The others that followed were all better than any other short stories I've ever read, but still not for me. I just don't feel that they are substantial enough. I'm a big character development person, I like it when you can watch a character grow, when you unearth a character layer by layer until they turn from characters in a book intopeople. People that I can love. And short stories never have the depth to do that for me. Or, I should say they rarely can do that for me. Munro is definitely the best short story writer I've come across, and I'll give her props for being as close to a mini novel a short story could be, but except for Runaway, these still didn't do it for me. But I would pick up more stories from Munro. One good thing about short stories is\u2026they're short! Meaning read in one sitting short. Meaning anytime I'm growing weary of some other book I'm reading and I need a lil break, I can pick up a short story and take a lil time out from the other book without investing so much time I can't keep track of both. It's glorious. So for that reason, I like short stories. I certainly wouldn't object to having a couple Munro collections around for just that purpose. If I'm gonna read short stories, may as well be quality ones like Munro's! Nobel Prize quality though? I think not."}, {"userName": "Chris Gager", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5295008-chris-gager", "userReview": "This will be my second read of this book. It's been a few years and also a while since I've read any Alice Munro, my favorite writer. Nobel Prize winner now and well deserved! I decided to read it because my friend Alice wrote some trivia questions from it and I couldn't remember much. \"Runaway\" is the lead story and one I read first in The New Yorker. In fact, I may not have actually read any of these stories in book form before. Five of the eight appeared in the New Yorker and that's where I likely read them first. So... maybe I actually haven't read the last three! This story is typically devastating. Three clueless people get into a dust-up. Munro's characters are so true to life and so messed up. I had a very attractive friend in Boulder back in the day who was married to a complete DUD. Also into horses as it turned out. At first I couldn't understand it but soon enough I came some sort of understanding. In her own quieter she was as messed up as he was. The old lady ought to have stayed out of it but she had her own neediness. The final imagery was cold and apt.\"Chance\" is another well-remembered story and the first in a trio about a narcissistic woman. She can't really help it. Again... the chill of violence and fate/chance help to nail down her character and her challenge(s) in life. Part two tonight... One always wonders how much of this narcissist is Munro looking at herself.\"Soon\" finds Juliet and her life a few years further on. Living with Eric and holding year-old Penelope on a trip back to Ontario to visit her oddball parents. Again... so much if this mirrors Munro's life in a general way. She goes back to it again and again and it never gets old! Her detachment is perfect...Munro writes about family love: confused, stunted, so difficult in so many ways. In contrast there's Irene, a person whose expectation and understanding and experience of love must surely be very different(if she has any) than that of Juliet's basically middle-class family. Munro's own mother, like Sara in the story, was brought down rather young by a wasting disease. The story of the picture is SO apt. I had a friends in Boulder who employed another friend of mine(neither knew about the connection) as a housekeeper. The housekeeper, a Christian of limited world experience and education, was freaked out by some African masks and such that my middle-class friends had on the wall. \"Devil worshipping\" stuff!!! I can see how some folks my be made uneasy by Chagall's imagery... I'm not that crazy about it myself!\"Silence\" - Now done with Juliet - I think - and on to other women's stories. The last story is about estrangement. Juliet's daughter \"abandons\" her needy mom. Forever apparently... Why? It's kind of a mystery to the mother but she kind of gets it. She wasn't much of a mother in some ways. The cult lady tries to tell her but Juliet resists knowing. She's VERY self-protective. A narcissist... Penelope needed the space - BIG time. It happens. If I'd had the sense about me I would have done the same with my father. I sort of did it by moving back to Colorado when I got out of the Navy. My brother did it more forcefully but not to the degree that Penelope did. Both of his wives did it eventually too. Impossible to live with that man and have a sane and happy life. Low-bottom alcoholism is brutal and they'll hold on and control as long as they can. You're helping them to stay sick and survive and not change. Anyway... Munro has another story about a \"runaway child\". This one's a son and there is an awkward \"reunion\" in it. Can't remember the title.\"Passion\" - Another well-remembered story with a protagonist much like Juliet: stubbornly self-absorbed and independent. A typical Munro icy jolt at the end.The next two stories(\"Passion\" and \"Tricks\") don't ring any strong memory bells but I may have read them if I did indeed read this whole book a while back. Both stories rely on hidden plot gimmicks for their impact and are therefore(to me) not as good as the preceding stories. Lots of these stories are about looking back from middle age. Plenty of emotional impact there...\"Powers\" - seems like I read this one too. The last story is typical Munro: covers a lot of social, cultural and temporal ground and emotional grit and grind. Dragged on just a bit near the end. Her endings are almost always bitter but with some edge taken off by time passing. Her males are NOT dependable!!! The baking scene reminded me of my grandmother making cinnamon swirls back in the 50's.

Munro does a great job of capturing the interior world of women at all ages, the feelings and thoughts so real to us. She also has a special talent for putting into words the quiet revelations life has to give. Here is a passage I particularly enjoyed from Passion, in which the character Grace returns to a lake cabin of her youth some decades later:\u201cWhat was Grace really looking for when she had undertaken this expedition? Maybe the worst thing would have been to get just what she might have thought she was after. Sheltering roof, screened windows, the lake in front, the stand of maple and cedar and balm of Gilead trees behind. Perfect preservation, the past in tact, when nothing of the kind could be said of herself.\u201dIn the same poignant way, Munro\u2019s endings never fail to satisfy and leave you feeling that there was only one way this story could have ever concluded, and the author nailed it. That said many stories do not end happily, just as in real life, perhaps because they capture the tragedy of living in an indifferent world so perfectly. But even so the author shows compassion for her characters, and so by the end we forgive them their flaws and can relate personally to their situations.It was a joy to discover Alice Munro and her Canadian landscape of northern forests, snow-dusted lakes, and icy streams, as well as her varied and unique group of women.

In \"Passion,\" a country girl emerging into the larger world via a job in a resort hotel discovers in a single moment of stunning insight the limits and lies of that mysterious emotion. Three stories are about a woman named Juliet\u2013in the first, she escapes from teaching at a girls\u2019 school into a wild and irresistible love match; in the second she returns with her child to the home of her parents, whose life and marriage she finally begins to examine; and in the last, her child, caught, she mistakenly thinks, in the grip of a religious cult, vanishes into an unexplained and profound silence. In the final story, \"Powers,\" a young woman with the ability to read the future sets off a chain of events that involves her husband-to-be and a friend in a lifelong pursuit of what such a gift really means, and who really has it.Throughout this compelling collection, Alice Munro\u2019s understanding of the people about whom she writes makes them as vivid as our own neighbors.
