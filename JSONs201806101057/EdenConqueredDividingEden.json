This one fell a bit short for me, but I was still glad I read it. Let's break it down, shall we?\nWhat I Liked:\n  Carys is awesome, and I kind of wanted to read all the chapters from her POV. Andreus just irked me- and I am well aware that he was supposed to- and Carys and her adventures and her friends were definitely exciting to read about. \n   There were definitely twists I didn't see coming. I liked that there was still so many things to discover about the characters, about the royal families, and even about Carys and Andreus's personalities. \n   I liked when Carys & Company were on the run. Not even sure why, but fleeing and hiding just appeals to me, and I liked that she had to basically play dead. \n   \nWhat I Didn't:\n  Andreus, why you so boring, my dude? Seriously, this guy wonders why he's only got a few loyal subjects, and I may have a few ideas. You tried to off your sister and you're about as exciting as paint drying, so... But he did get one of my favorite characters on his side, so I guess there's that. \n   Speaking of Andreus, I could\u00a0not keep all the random \"Elders\" straight in his POV chapters. And normally I'd just ignore them, but they were important to the outcome of the story. But once you've met one random, undeveloped old guy, you've met them all... or something? \n   The romance did\u00a0not work for me. I think in book one, I saw the romance going a certain way. In book two, it went in another, and the character it focused on, well, I didn't really feel\u00a0anything for him. Basically, I felt the love interest was too underdeveloped for me to much care about him. \n   The pacing was kind of inconsistent. It started off on the slower end, but by the end twenty different things were happening and I was kind of confused. \n   \nBottom Line: \nWhile I am glad to have some conclusion to the series, it just wasn't as strong as the first book in plot or character development."}, {"userName": "Clephiro", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7357268-clephiro", "userReview": "[Andreus is still a giant tool. He spends most of the book trying to figure out who he can trust. He makes terrible decisions that hurt the few people who actually like him. Still, despite EVERYTHING that his sister has done for him, he continues to distrust her. Carys, continues to claim to be tough and fierce, while getting the guys to do all her fighting for her. She has a romance with Errick that I didn't really feel much for. The whole thing just felt super awkward. Things finally get sort of resolved when Carys and Andreus actually TALK to each other instead of making assumptions and misunderstanding each other. The whole thing still felt really anti-climatic. I wish that there was more fighting with the monsters and less time spent on wondering who they can trust.

Unknown assailants and spies lurking in the shadows of the court. Who to trust? And who will save Eden?This sequel to Dividing Eden in ways did it justice, but likewise could have been better. Carys is terrified of the power she's uncovered within her. Andreus wants to prove himself as king, yet there's a nagging feeling that not all is right within the walls of his kingdom - let alone within his castle.While the pacing lagged at times, the story alternates between Carys and Andreus for each chapter. Both the twins have no idea who they can fully trust in the aftermath of the Trials they were forced to take. Their storylines tried to develop their individual journey towards placing trust in the right people, and even taking steps to right wrongs that were done by their hand. Carys had escaped with two men with questionable pasts while Andreus almost had no one in the castle that may not have ulterior motives to setting him on the throne. Charbonneau did well in writing their fears, desires and other emotions into their POVs, yet at times this really slowed down the plot.I can't say that action wasn't a pivotal component of the story. An imminent attack on Eden from their rival country was coming, and different groups had different agendas for who should be put on the throne. There was always an underlying sense of urgency - whether in Carys' return to the castle or Andreus' ability to outwit his shadowy enemies - but the action only packed the greatest punch in the last 25% or so of the novel.And oh boy, was that something. Like a wind hurtling full force, all of a sudden a bunch of things were coming into play. Vague predictions/messages from the seers, monsters coming at full force out of the darkness, and the threat of war just amassed on these twins. Unseen twists caught me by surprise, though I'm not sure in hindsight why I didn't see that coming. Yet now in hindsight, I can't help but feel somewhat cheated in the ending to this duology. Don't get me wrong, it was exciting in a way but it all happened so fast. Each \"obstacle\" was resolved in a way that didn't take the time to fully appreciate the climax of the story. Even the twins' reunion after the rocky way they left each other in book 1 all occurred so fast.What I will say about the ending that redeemed this entire book for me was that it didn't wrap itself up in a very nice bow. Not completely at least. It's not a sad ending, but things are left somewhat open to the happiness and future of the protagonists. And while this entire series, including this sequel, only supplemented the story with romance, I felt it was the perfect amount to support the plot instead of overwhelm it. The highlight was kept on the twins' character development and unearthing the subterfuge amidst them.Would I rather the novel was extended a bit more to really flesh out the climax, and maybe added to the plot a bit more? For sure. But as it stands, Eden Conquered managed to deliver an ending that I think was worthwhile in some way still.Overall Recommendation:Eden Conquered may not have packed as heavy of a punch as a final installment to this duology, but it made up for its lack of plot and sometimes slow pacing with a beautiful focus on character development. Both Carys and Andreus are flawed protagonists with their own inner demons, or curses, they had to face. With a kingdom depending on them working together instead of against one another, this sequel placed emphasis on all the right aspects that made it a worthy conclusion in the end. A surprise twist here and there, a touch of feels and an ending that was somewhat open to interpretation, I at least leave Eden with a smile on my face.---------------------------------------------For more of my reviews, check out Down the Rabbit Hole:"}, {"userName": "Elisha", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32802331-elisha", "userReview": "EDEN CONQUERED by Joelle Charbonneau is the second book in a duology about royal twins competing for the throne. When their father and brother are ruthlessly killed, both Carys and Andreus are thrust into the Trials of Virtuous Succession by the scheming Elders. This second book begins with Carys regrouping in the wilderness and learning to control her newly discovered power. However, she can\u2019t hide out forever if she wants to save Eden and all her subjects. She must return and face her brother, who she\u2019ll either have to kill or forgive in order to carry out her plans.I love court intrigue books. They always offer a glimpse into a world of power, plotting, backstabbing and jealousy that I can only imagine. The Eden stories, in particular, fulfill these genre expectations, but also have problems unique to this setting. For example, the orb, the windmills, and the necessity of light to fend off the Xhelozi, murderous creatures that come out of hibernation in the winter, are all original. This is also the first time I\u2019ve read this genre in third person limited with shifting perspectives and it actually worked without taking away from the story.Two characters in this book continuously steal my heart, and that\u2019s Max, the young boy Andreus rescued, and Lord Errik, the mysterious visitor keen on helping Princess Carys. In fact, on a whole, I like the minor characters more than I like the protagonists, though the Garret storyline could have been better developed. I anticipated a big reveal or twist regarding his past and his current intentions. Instead, the outcome is unsatisfying and makes the actual presence of his character even unnecessary. The timing in this book feels off. I have no clue exactly how long Carys is away from Eden, which lessens the tension and urgency of their situation. Eventually, once Carys knows where she wants to go, the characters specifically discuss the length and difficulties of the journey ahead, but then they get to their destination very fast. It seems like they arrive the same day they leave, which makes no sense per their previous conversation. Overall, EDEN CONQUERED has better pacing than the first book in the series, and the last third of the story is when all the plot twists and action start to get exciting. However, the ending is also fairly open. It reads as though it\u2019s setting itself up for a third book, and without one, the series loses much of the story\u2019s potential. Having put in the time to read these two novels, I want to know what will become of Errik, how will Carys learn to control her powers, how will Andreus behave now, what will become of the Queen, and how will the Elders be restructured. I\u2019ll read just about anything by Joelle Charbonneau after THE TESTING, but this novel is good for fans of BITTERBLUE by Kristin Cashore.

He won the Trials of Virtuous Succession, lose the love of his life, Imogen, and his twin, Carys, in the process, and felt their deaths heavily on his heart. Once on the throne, problems in the kingdom started to arise. The lack of wind causes the lights to flicker, and with the colder months upon them, the Xhelozi are ready to attack any person left in the dark. When a hooded figure tries to murder Max, Andreus knew one of The Elders was behind the attack. But which one? Andreus, Max, and a guard that was loyal to his sister, Graylen, ban together to find out what future The Elders had for the kingdom of Eden.Carys were very much alive. Traveling the outside of the kingdom, her team consists of Garret, Larkin and Errik; in which it was only Larkin who Carys truly trusted. Garret\u2019s uncle was trying to set him up on the throne; Errik\u2019s family was the family that Carys\u2019s great-grandfather killed to become king. Imogen was also Errik\u2019s cousin, whom Carys blame for turning her brother on her during the trials. Yet the both told Carys to trust them, and not the other. Separated from her twin, Carys angry towards him grows, as Andreus betrayal was something Carys never thought she had to face. Traveling to the seers\u2019 village, Carys wanted to know how Imogen was selected as the kingdom\u2019s seer. After that, Carys was out for blood, wanting to reclaim her throne, she was willing to kill her twin, no matter what.Thoughts:The saying that the sequel will never be good as the original falls true to this Joelle Charbonneau story. The final book in the duology, this book did not have the same spark that Dividing Eden had, that made it such an amazing book. With the writing style the same, Charhonneau mad, no development of the Carys character, and little, if any, to Andreus. Still taking on the point of view of Carys and Andreus, it was easy to tell which character was talking, as the switch from chapter to chapter. Charbonneau never really got into the fact that Imogen betrayed Andreus, as it was mentioned that once on throne, Imogen was going to kill Andreus, as she did Micah. Andreus was more upset that Imogen made him turn on Carys, than the fact the girl he loved, never loved him. With somewhat of a slow start, Charbonneau wrote the book as twist after twist, making the plot pretty inconsistent. With shocks coming until the end, the book is not bad, just a letdown after the amazingness that was Dividing Eden."}, {"userName": "Di", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21177980-di", "userReview": "** I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions are my own. **I read and reviewed the first book in this series, Dividing Eden and while I didn't love it I was excited for this, the sequel and final book in the duology. While in a lot of aspects there was improvement (e.g. the world building became clearer and easier to understand) I was still left somewhat disappointed with this series. I felt like the characters became a little more relateable and yet they still fell flat for me. The character interactions were weak and after the setup of the first book I just felt that very little was done to build on the characters and their development and once character in particular seemed to almost do a 180 in terms of from the first book to the second which I found too unrealistic and the motivations too feeble. The writing was far too expository and I felt like I was just getting detail after detail after detail without being left to be able to decide anything for myself which then caused a lot of the court intrigues and politics to become bland and a plot twist to lose it's effect because every little element was just over explained. Yes, it is nice that the author had thought of these things in the first place, but as readers we need to be given credit that we can figure some things out for ourselves and that makes the enjoyment of reading far sweeter. Overall it was unfortunate that this series just wasn't for me and the pro's weren't strong enough to carry both books and I was left, again, feeling underwhelmed."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9781252-amy", "userReview": "Many thanks to EdelweissPlus and the publisher for an eARC of this for review. All opinions are my own.For this sequel, Charbonneau turned up the volume and the intensity, creating a fast-paced story full of mystery, intrigue, and surprises. Andreus has been crowned King and Carys, his twin, is dead. Only she's not, and he's barely hanging on to the crown. The chapters switch back and forth from his perspective to hers, and each ends with a mini-cliffhanger that has you wanting to figure out what is going to happen next. As both Andreus and Carys figure out that many of those they presumed to trust don't have their best interests in mind, they begin to realize that their best bet for saving the kingdom is trust each other. Of course, the last time they saw each other they betrayed one another and left their sibling for dead. So trust won't come easy. But it might be the only thing that will save the kingdom.Again, this book has some implied sexual situations, but very little of it is graphic.

Carys and Andreus are still fighting to determine who will be the one ruler of Eden, but the twins don\u2019t know who to trust anymore.Without spoiling the end of the first book, Dividing Eden, Carys is trying to learn more about herself and her discovery at the end of the first book. She is a more-developed character, who is a badass, who is strong-willed, and who loves her brother and wants to do what\u2019s best for Eden. Andreus is still unlikeable, he sulks a lot, he\u2019s the opposite of Carys, he\u2019s broken after the end of the first book, and he is trying to figure out who he can trust in the kingdom.Like the first book, The story is told from the point-of-view of the two protagonists: Carys and Andreus. I found Carys\u2019 story to be more interesting overall, and she definitely has the most development throughout the book. Andreus\u2019 chapters were boring and I honestly couldn\u2019t care less what happened to him. The story started off well-paced, but around halfway the pacing picked up in an awkward way that made me feel like the story was overall rushed. The last third of the book there were too many \u201cplot twists\u201d that, after the first one, had me groaning. The pacing at the point where all of the twists were coming to light was awkward and rushed. They were also unnecessary. By the end I felt that despite having these plot twists that the ending was unresolved. I read this book not realizing that it was the end of the series. The ending certainly doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s the last we will see of Andreus and Carys. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything further planned with these two, but as of right now, I feel there needs to be some sort of epilogue further explaining the status of the twins.Overall , I recommend that you just pass on this book. It\u2019s an unevenly paced read, which will likely frustrate you as it did me. Carys is a great character, but she isn\u2019t worth enduring two books worth of awkward writing and plot."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11401322-erin", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book in exchange of an honest review.
