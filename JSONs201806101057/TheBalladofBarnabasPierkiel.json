The title character, latest in a long line of pig herders, lives in the tiny Odolechka, Scalvusia, an Eastern European backwater village (ten times worse than Moldova) in 1939. There he\u2019s part of a passionate, savage local scene that includes a priest who pins his own earlobe to a door with a fork and a mayor who lustily consumes radishes slathered in lard. Competing against local nobleman Karol Von Grushka, shy and lowly Barnabas attempts to win the attentions of the beautiful Roosha. As a reading experience this is equal parts ridiculous and sublime, somewhat akin to a Peter Greenaway film invaded by the Marx Brothers. Readers willing to let plot and character development take a back seat to language, as when a \u201c\u2026magpie warped and quirked,\u201d and the delight of vocabulary (e.g., \u201c\u2026a talbot eyeing a trefoil\u201d) will be immensely entertained by this decidedly unserious read. Where many literary authors often take a grim tone, Zyzak remains understatedly humorous and lighthearted\u2014with an occasional Proustian overtone. VERDICT Zyzak is a major talent to whom many will swear allegiance. Within the first ten pages readers will know if they like this densely and dryly comic novel.Find this review and others at Books for Dudes, the online reader's advisory column for men from Library Journal: see http://reviews.libraryjournal.com/cat....

The Ballad of Barnabas Pierkiel, by Magdalena Zyzak, is one of those few books. It begins with an ethnic joke, featuring a man who embodies the perceived stupidity of the fictitious Eastern European Scalvusian people. Narrated by an unnamed Scalvusian sometime after the war, The Ballad of Barnabas Pierkiel is the story of the people of the village of Odolechka in 1939. The eponymous Barnabas chases a Romani woman he loves while the mayor and police chief overeat; the mayor\u2019s wife tries to improve herself through nutrition, religion, and fascism; a man tries to stir up a proletarian uprising with misremembered Marxist jargon; and an escaped insane man steals everything that isn\u2019t nailed down. Then a German spy parachutes right into the middle of Odolechka...Read the rest of my review at A Bookish Type."}, {"userName": "Boris Feldman", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6370810-boris-feldman", "userReview": "The stupidest book I ever ( started to) read.How does this crap get published?"}, {"userName": "Ferris", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/819818-ferris", "userReview": "This is an Eary Reviewer edition I got from LibraryThing.com. It is the author's debut novel and I am stunned that this is a first. This satire/allegory/theater of the absurd story is reminiscent of \"Waiting For Godot\". I laughed, chuckled and almost wept over the plight of this cast of characters and their slapstick absurdity. At the same time, it is a tragic tale of ignorance and blind acceptance of fear based rhetoric. The kind of twisted logic that cost six million people their lives during WWII and continues to cost lives in the present day around the world. The readers can choose to appreciate this brilliant novel as a funny tale of fools, or can leave themselves vulnerable to a profound tale of the absudity and tragedy of the creatures we call humans!"}, {"userName": "Mishel Forte", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2758235-mishel-forte", "userReview": "Ugh!!!! this is my first DNF. I've given it a lot of thought because I hate to give up on a book and I haven't..until now. I don't think, even with time, I'll be able to get through this one. I thought the eccentric and unique style would eventually grab me, because the synopsis certainly did. But I just kept waiting and waiting for something to grab my interest and all I really wanted to do close the book and start something else. *sigh*I don't know if it was the writing style, the characters, the weird language use, or a combination of all of the above that left a bad taste in my mouth but I give up, sadly."}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/706942-victoria", "userReview": "Within a few paragraphs, I had a sense that this was not going to be my cup of tea.

This book is funny, thoughtful, and ridiculous in the best ways. You can't help but love Barnabas, who reminds me the village half-wit, and root for him on his quest to win the gypsy queen's heart.  I found this book thoroughly enjoyable. It reminds me of an eastern European version of Monty Python at it's finest. It's a book about finding light and pleasure, even in horrible circumstances."}, {"userName": "Pharlap", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64786795-pharlap", "userReview": "Very elaborate writing, in which I could not find any essence at all.

It was well written, the main characters had a great deal of appeal, and the story, such as it is, is fun enough to be worth reading. But in the end I felt as if I hadn\u2019t gotten the point of the exercise.\tThe author is Polish by birth and now lives in America and I\u2019m not certain if those two facts are germane to the review of this book. One\u2019s history does inform what one can write about and how they go about the writing, so from that point of view it is relevant, but then again, as you read though this story, you find it doesn\u2019t matter in the least.Puzzling, isn\u2019t it?\tThen again it might matter. This is a tale of a luckless swineherd in the soon to be non-existent country of Scalvusia somewhere around 1939. He is in love with Roosha (said out loud it sounds like a southern US pronunciation of Russia) but , of course, he is a swineherd and this beautiful gypsy girl lives with local nobleman, Von Grushka, so what chance does Barnabas have with her. Still, she is a gypsy with her wild side so his hope never fails him.They, along with a cavalcade of deftly well-defined supporting characters, give this farce grandeur it\u2019s material should not be able to have. That not only does it engage us, that it amuses us and reveals to us a small world we have never seen before is part of the miracle of the narrative.\tBoth ridiculous yet absurd in a slapstick manner, and still endearing as our hero makes his way though the days, this is an entertaining read. To say the least it is light hearted in tone even as the clouds of war loom all over this story. It is hard to believe this is a first novel.\tI am very happy with this Goodreads win."}, {"userName": "Todd", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22590771-todd", "userReview": "Imagine if Charles Dickens' Great Expectations were entertaining, funny, and something you actually wanted to pick up and read. Well here it is! Both stories are about a useless young man trying to improve himself in superficial ways in order to win the love of a young lady, but otherwise they part ways soon enough. Zyzak's story is absurd parody, told of an imaginary Slavic nation with exaggerated clich\u00e9s comprising the humor, along with the protagonist's (Barnabas Pierkiel, naturally) misadventures. It's not the book of the century, but it certainly is good fun."}, {"userName": "Anna Shabalov", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22869051-anna-shabalov", "userReview": "I won this book from a GoodReads Giveaway contest. Basically, I thought this book was just ok and for me that was a big letdown. The premise sounded awesome, Eastern Europe and alternate history are my jam, and then the book jacket had praise from Gary Shteyngart and I got really excited. And all that never really panned out. I didn't find the book to be very funny, I wasn't particularly taken with the use of language, the plot dragged, the generalized Eastern European setting didn't add much to the peasant caricature. I don't know, I really wanted to love this and just didn't."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Ochoa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17138550-jennifer-ochoa", "userReview": "I received an ARC from Goodreads Giveaways in exchange for my review. I wanted to give this a higher rating because its very well-written, but I found my mind wandering toward the latter half. It's a funny satirical tale with comically ridiculous characters engaging in silly antics. Humor is hard to successfully pull off, but the writer is obviously very clever in creating her characters and dialogue. I found myself chuckling aloud a few times and smiling quite a bit.

That's kind of my feeling about this book. The characters are fun and interesting, the narrator is entertaining, and the ending avoids being stereotypical. Generally these are all things that make me love a book, but for some reason I struggled with this one, and found it hard to pay attention.

Desperate to attract the voluptuous Roosha, the Gypsy concubine of the local boot-and-shoe magnate, Barnabas and his short-legged steed Wilhelm get embroiled in a series of scandals and misadventures, as every attempt at wooing ends in catastrophe. After the mysterious death of an important figure in the community, a witch-hunt ensues, and a stranger falls from the sky. Barnabas begins to see the terrible tide of history turning in his beloved hometown. The wonderfully eccentric supporting cast includes a priest driven mad by a fig tree, a gang of louts who taunt our reluctant hero at every turn, and a dim-witted vagabond with a goat for a wife. Even as her characters brush up against one of the darkest moments of the twentieth century, Magdalena Zyzak's humor and prose delight in the absurdities of the human animal.", "title": "The Ballad of Barnabas Pierkiel", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17910077-the-ballad-of-barnabas-pierkiel", "average": 3.04, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1369569429l/17910077.jpg", "reviews": 24, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7086086.Magdalena_Zyzak", "name": "Magdalena Zyzak"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Humor", "Literary Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17910077-the-ballad-of-barnabas-pierkiel"]}
