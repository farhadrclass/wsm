This new series featuring Harry Clifton, son of a dockworker (or is he the son of an upper crust owner of a huge shipping line?), and his climb through the British public school system is going to be a delight if this first one of five is any indication. Make no mistake, this is not a Pulitzer, but it is good, solid storytelling, with bold characters, a world wide setting, and a story that has enough twists, turns, and sneaky heart-stoppers to definitely merit the label \"page turner.\"The story involves Harry, as he grows from an angelic choirboy into an intelligent, hardworking young man faced with the difficult choice of going to Oxford upon graduation from the US equivalent of high school, or joining the armed forces as Britain enters the war against Hitler. His romance with the sister of his best friend, together with some of the aforementioned story twists makes his choice even more difficult. Harry's mother, a hard-working widow, who takes a series of back-breaking jobs to help with Harry's expenses, is harboring a secret about Harry's parentage. This secret, if revealed could destroy lives, and Archer skillfully weaves his story around it.My only problem with the book was the absolutely sucker punch ending. I was left gasping, yelling \"Don't do that to me!!.\" I will be among thousands lined up to get my hands on the second book in the series to find out what happens next. The Clifton Chronicles promises to keep us all enthralled for several years to come."}, {"userName": "RJ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3354851-rj", "userReview": "Sometimes you read a book everyone else seems to loveLoveLOVE and then wonder if you bought the same book everyone else did because as far as you're concerned, it stank. For me, that would be this book.The author goes to great lengths to convince us that yes, the Main Character is indeed a brilliant child/man with unseen depths and superb intellect. We must believe this because of the great lengths other characters go to ensure that the Main Character has the means to build on his future, and the same supporting characters are always engaged in conversation talking about how brilliant Main Character is and conspiring to make sure a tiny kid does not know that everyone is working in collusion to get him to accept opportunities unavailable to other, lesser children of his socioeconomic class. Since Main Character is brilliant, but would refuse the help of those who love him.I haven't come across that sort of blatant ass-kissing of a fictional character since I read Stephanie Meyer's homage to the Supreme Glorious Awesome Majestic Sparkleness that is His Magnificence, Edward Cullen. Also known as the Twilight books.The story seems disconnected and very patched together. The overlapping time-lines from the perspective of multiple characters make for tedious reading. The author attempts to end every chapter with some sort of mysterious tease, clearly intended to make the reader curious but it gets annoying after a bit because it always ends in predictable anti-climax.I will not be reading the rest of the series. If I had to sum up my opinion of this book in one sentence, it would be \"Honey, could you pass me the Excedrin?\"."}, {"userName": "Sara Bow", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14391138-sara-bow", "userReview": "Morgen wird sofort band zwei gekauft \ud83e\udd17"}, {"userName": "Frances", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37439004-frances", "userReview": "A heart warming story set back in the early 1900\u2019s which follows a young lad named Harry Clifton as he faces the many obstacles throughout his life\u2019s journey to manhood.

Not just in plot, but in nuance too. This was the first book I read by Jeffrey Archer, but I have every intention of reading many more after this one. This book is set up so that each section is from one person's perspective. Harry, Maisie, Jack Tar, Hugo, Giles and Emma all get a section. (Harry gets the first and last section. Maisie gets an extra few pages in the prologue.) Sounds like a common set up, but here is where it gets really interesting: each section starts with a first person narrative as the first chapter. The remaining chapters are told by a third present omnipresent narrator still focused on that character. The narrator occasionally provides some insight into what the other people currently in the scene are thinking. The best part, in my opinion, is that these narrations overlap. I have seen books where each section tells the next part of the story, and I have seen books where each section tells the same story from multiple perspectives. Each narration, while covering part of the same story, also moves the story forward. The beautiful part of this was that the overlapping parts focused on the things that THAT character found important or were relevant to that character. Therein lies the proof of amazing writing and a thorough understanding of how people think. These characters are extremely well developed. We are even given a chance to look into the world through the eyes of the book's villain. Each character's story fills in gaps left in previous issues because either that character didn't think it was that important or because the previous narrator didn't know. This gives the story a mild sense of mystery and a huge sense of the inter-connectedness of people. This is a story about coincidences, about what people will do for love, about how life can go full circle, and how people get their due. This is a story about friendship, about the way different events are important to different people, and about how the actions of others - that we don't even know about - can affect so many aspects of our lives. This is a story about unfortunate circumstances, about class bigotry, and about redemption. This is a beautifully written book.Review of Clifton Chronicles #2 The Sins of the Father:http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12..."}, {"userName": "Helene Jeppesen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21992464-helene-jeppesen", "userReview": "Apparently, this is a bestseller - a book that loads of people around the world have devoured. And I get why that is because it is a pretty straight-forward, easily read story about several families, several destinies and several points of view that entwine. Especially the beginning of this historical family saga had me intrigued because it tells enchantingly about these three boys and their struggles on a boarding school. However, as my reading progressed the story became more and more redundant and predictable, and especially towards the end it felt like Jeffrey Archer included historical aspects to the story just for the sake of accentuating the history that was going on simultaneously to the characters' lives. It didn't feel natural for him to suddenly talk about Churchill and his actions up to the Second World War. Also, this is one of those books that you should read for its story, not for its writing. Not that there's anything absolutely wrong with the writing, but at times it becomes moralizing, and all the way through it is written in a language that is easily and quickly read. All in all, the beginning of this novel intrigued me, but having now finished it I don't think I'm going to continue reading this long family saga. It just didn't impress me enough, even though I will say that this first book was definitely an entertaining read."}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "Only Time Will Tell (The Clifton Chronicles) by Jeffrey Archer was an enjoyable book.I listened to this book and the narrator was really good and very well suited to the story.I really enjoy family sagas and this was no exception with its well formed characters, a flowing and twisting tale and a little social history to keep the reader entertained.This book reminded me a little of Downton Abbey and I think readers who enjoyed that series will really enjoy the clifton Chronicles.I was a little disappointed with a couple aspects of the story but overall an enjoyable read.

Seems to me that \"It's ok\" should be smack in the middle followed by \"I liked it\" and \"I loved it.\" This book was OK. Average. Predictable but entertaining beach read or exercise, driving story. I listented to it and it made my 3 miles on the treadmill bearable and that is what I want in an audiobook. It was well written because Archer is incapable of writing poorly. My major beef is that we get to the end AND IT JUST STOPS. I realize that there are 5 sequels coming, but most authors do write books that can stand alone, even though there are sequels. This goes for relatively new authors such as Suzanne Collins. Archer, having been around since the year of the flood, knows better. Shame on him.Shame also on St. Martin's Press who get an F for editing. The protagonist in this book is arrested in the U.S. at the beginning of WW II and the cops read him his rights!?!? I think not. The Miranda rule made its debut 20 years AFTER the war ended. Methinks that Archer and his editors have been watching too much Law and Order!"}, {"userName": "Jerry B", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3901425-jerry-b", "userReview": "This saga is the first in what is to be at least a three-book set (quite possibly more) entitled the Clifton Chronicles, centered around the character Harry Clifton. Relatively plotless, the story was however so engaging it was difficult to put down, with the interesting technique of revealing the tale little by little from different character's points of view. We hear from Harry's mother Maisie, his best friend Giles, Gile's sister Emma, Gile's father Hugo, Harry's friend \"Old Jack\", and from Harry himself on a couple of different occasions. Spanning the period between the world wars (roughly 1920-1940) and set in Britain, this first book traces Harry\u2019s school career to his likelihood of entering the Navy as it seems war with Hitler is on the horizon. The struggles of his mother to finance Harry\u2019s upbringing (his father is dead) are particularly engrossing, and the intrigue of Harry\u2019s father\u2019s circumstances add an element of suspense to this entertaining novel, which ends with a bombshell of a cliffhanger! Like most readers, we can hardly await the second installment!"}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "First of all, let me state clearly that two stars means I think this book is OK! Whether you should read it or not ought to depend upon your mood and what you are looking for. It is not poorly written and will satisfy those readers who love series, love adventure stories, love plot-oriented books and love solving a puzzle. What kind of a puzzle? You know in fact very early on who the central character's father is, but what keeps you reading is to discover how the author is going to weave together all the details to make an entertaining story that makes sense. Each of the central characters tells you what they know and what has happened to them personally. With each retelling of the story you get a few more details, but there is a lot of repetition. In this respect it works very well as an audiobook because the repetition means you are not going to miss important details. Deep things to think about, deep character portrayal, lots of historical details are not what you will find served in this book. Action and finding out what is going to happen, that is what you read the book for. The story is set in Bristol, England right before the Second World War. We look at the life of dockers, stevedores and a successful family owning a shipping line. We follow three boys at boarding school. The book is about their friendship, their different social classes and different goals.The narration of the audiobook was absolutely superb. The primary narrator is Roger Allam, with shorter sections by Emilia Fox. She reads the female first person narratives. Allam does American and English dialects wonderfully. He does the upper class and the lower class characters so you hear each one\u2019s social class in how they speak. He speaks very clearly and with strength so you miss nothing. When he impersonates Churchill, I couldn't help but smile. The narration could not have been better. The book ends with a cliffhanger, so you buy the next book. ********************Currently (2016-10-15) this is free at both audible.co.uk and audible.com .

When his singing talents allow him to land a scholarship to a super fancy school, his fate will change. Filled with family secrets and stories of the different ways life can take us, this book was the great kick off to what promises to be an exciting series!I love characters that you can root for! Harry is the definitive underdog character. He is being raised by a single mother in a time where this was not common. Harry seems content to follow his father's footsteps. He isn't that interested in school and then fate intervenes and sends him on a different path.I also really liked the setting. I loved the juxtaposition through Harry's relatively calm, no frills life with his mother and the lives of Harry's newfound friends at his new school. They are so different from each other but are still able to find common ground and really solidify their friendship. There are also some secret connections throughout the book that I'll go into more detail on below.The biggest reason I enjoyed this book is all of the family secrets. Oh, there are some doozies in here. I don't want to give anything away but there are a lot of secret connections between Harry and some of the other characters in the book and I loved seeing them unraveled throughout the book.

In December 2012, I read my first Jeffrey Archer novel and am now hooked. He is the best story teller I have read in the past two years.

I feel like I am almost a member of the Clifton clan. ONLY TIME WILL TELL is the 1st of the three novels Mr. Archer has written regarding the Cliftons. His 2nd Clifton novel, THE SINS OF THE FATHER, is equally engrossing. Although the plots are not \"hair-raising\" as those by many of the authors mentioned previously, they are masterfully written in a manner that causes me to turn the pages as rapidly as possible.

I think I finished it in record time, considering I am a slow reader.But seriously? It felt like I was reading a soap opera. It was outright pushy and juvenile in its style of writing as the author tries so hard, rather too hard, to prove how the main character is exceptionally brilliant, a child prodigy and how the entire town of Bristol is co-conspiring to help him out. It seemed like every second page had something to corroborate his brilliance (even though it is done mostly through people discussing in conspiratorial whispers about his talent and how he must never know how they help him) or how Old Jack manages to know every possible important person in Harry's life from the war and engage them to help him.

With that cliffhanger, do I have a choice?It's a wonderful cast of characters, reminiscent (IMO) of Peyton Place, and I hope the author doesn't take offense at that.

Harry Clifton comes from a poor family, where every benefit is earned and each hardship a hurdle. When he meets Giles Barrington he soon forges a life-long friendship, even if they come from different social circles. Clifton forges ahead to make a name for himself, while living under the shadow of never having met his father. While Clifton presumes Arthur Clifton died on the battlefields, the truth is known to a select few that he was involved in a horrific workplace incident, at the hands of Hugo Barrington. The reader also learns of Clifton's mother, Maisie, who seeks to put a troubled past out of her mind and make a name for herself, all while concerned that Harry might discover the truth about his father. As the story progresses, Harry continues to be scholastically sound, but his heart remains weak when it coms to young Emma Barrington, sister of Giles and eldest daughter of Hugo. Harry and Emma build a love deeply rooted in honesty, but may face insurmountable challenges because of one lie. As Harry deals with revelations on his wedding day, he flees and finds himself in a web of lies and legal troubles on the shores of New York, as the reader stares into the abyss at the wonderful cliffhanger left at the end of the tale. Archer begins the series with a splendid foundation, sure to offer many offshoots in the coming books. The book has the flavour of Follett's Century series and Rutherfurd's multi-generational novels, where the reader must pay attention not only to the story, but also the collection of characters and their nuances. Archer singles himself out by using seven narrators to tell the same story from their own point of view. These narratives add more to the story in a powerful and progressive manner. This is sure to keep readers wondering what lies ahead, the test of a well-crafted novel. So far things flow nicely and the characters come to life in true Archer fashion. However, no one is safe and no storyline is sure to remain on the straight and narrow.Kudos Mr. Archer for this wonderful introduction, with a number of great cliffhangers and dramatic twists.
