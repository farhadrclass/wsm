If you enjoy legal thrillers, this is a definite must read. When Allie Whitman meets up with Connor Norman of Doyle & Brown, a law firm who specializes in fraudulent claim lawsuits, all sorts of sparks begin to fly. The Devil to Pay is run solely by Allie, who is a CPA sent into large corporations to dig around and find fraud against California's local government contracts. Of course, as Allie searches for these hidden frauds, some of the corporations don't much like it, and brings about many dynamic forces. There's a little murder, espionage, lots of law and a bit of romance tied in.This story is extremely fast-paced, and reads like a good Law & Order episode. You will find it hard to put down. I came across this book as a recommendation from a friend on Goodreads, and I'm so glad I read it. Very enjoyable and not one dull moment."}, {"userName": "Bill Garrison", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/977395-bill-garrison", "userReview": "WHEN THE DEVIL WHISTLES, by Rick Acker, is a great legal thriller rooted and realism and carried by interesting characters and fascinating twists and turns.Connor Norman is the rich son of an ex-Senator and a partner in a law firm where he specializes in Qui Tam plaintiffs. These are whistleblowers who sue on behalf of the government, and get a cut of whatever the government recovers from the corporations committing fraud. Allie Whitman is the temp accountant that goes from corporation to corporation as an undercover whistleblower. She and Connor are friends only. Company policy forbids him from dating clients, and besides, Allie has a wannabe rocker boyfriend. Trouble strikes when Allie's boyfriend gets in legal trouble, and Allie gets blackmailed into a situation that threatens her life. One of the companies Allie works for is involved in salvaging lost vessells at sea and looking for treasure. This company employs armed guards, and employees that ask too many questions are threatened. When Allie gets into too deep, her troubles begin.Allie is a great character, a woman with a troubled past and a good heart who still struggles to make the right choices. I enjoyed her relationship with Connor, and could tell they longed to be together, but couldn't because of his work and her boyfriend. The momentum of their relationship stops midway through the novel, however, so that was a little disappointing, but it picks back up at the end.I really enjoyed the realism of the legal aspects of the novel. Rick Acker is basically writing about the law he deals with in real life, and he makes it really interesting. Acker is an author I will continue to read. He creates good characters, solid supsense, and this book was a true page turner."}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5348032-pat", "userReview": "Allie Whitman had made a very comfortable living as a professional whistleblower. She and her lawyer, Connor Norman had partnered with California's Deputy Attorney General on numerous cases recovering millions of tax payer's dollars from corrupt companies. However, her latest job turns into a nightmare, when rather than finding dirt on the company she finds her secrets exposed and knowledge of a deadly plot that could cost millions their lives.Meanwhile, the crew of the Grasp II believed they were looking for a sunken German submarine loaded with riches. Upon reaching the excavation site though, they realize the story about the German sub was nothing more than a cover. Far from their home port of Oakland and with their lives in danger, the crew was powerless to summon help or warn authorities of the impending disaster. In an intricate and intelligent story, When the Devil Whistles combines a legal drama, with an entertaining story line, a bit of romance, and an international terrorist plot to create an interesting, page turning novel."}, {"userName": "Nora St Laurent", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1100689-nora-st-laurent", "userReview": ": I was thrilled to receive a review copy of a book with such an intriguing subject. This author weaves such a suspenseful and dramatic story, that I stayed up late reading to find out what happened next. Rick Acker gives us a sneak peek into his day job as a deputy attorney general in California's Department of Justice. This author takes the reader through the ins and outs of a high profile criminal case. It was captivating and chilling. Rick says, \"I try to put as little fiction as possible into my novels. Partly because I owe it to readers like you to get my facts right...I also enjoy the research, talking to fighter pilots and scientists\u2026visiting museums and labs...\" Not only does Rick Acker pen a suspenseful, legal drama, but I learned so much when I read his books. He takes the reader places we normally wouldn't go. I like that.This book reminded me of the movie Duplicity with Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. I had to pay close attention to the set up in the beginning, so I would catch the sting. Rick does the same with this book. He doesn't bog you down with too much, but just enough to peek inside this fascinating and scary subject. I had no idea a devil whistle blower existed and how they function in an actual case. This author states he has prosecuted corporate fraud lawsuits like those described in this novel. The main female character is Allie, a young, smart business woman, who knows what she wants and goes after it. Allie says this about her temp work with large companies, \"The first day of a new temp job was normally an exciting time. She was a spy setting foot in an energy country for the first time - an undercover Jane Bond who had tricked her way into the heart of a malevolent conspiracy to steal taxpayer dollars. The contrast and between her blah cover and her secret mission - spiced with just a touch of danger - was absolutely delicious.\" I enjoyed Allie and felt compassion for the guilt that plagued her. Allie\u2019s partner, Connor, is a brilliant attorney who prides himself on bringing in the bad guy. He says to Allie, \"We really do get to fight crime. I love that - I wish everyone took the law as seriously as we do. If you commit a crime, you should pay the price. Every. Single. Time. No excuses, no compromises.\"They were a great team until Allie got caught in a serious situation she couldn\u2019t share with anyone. She didn't want to hurt Connor. But the hand was dealt. She had no control over what happened next! It\u2019s a deadly game they played - especially if the whistle blower is caught. The walls of Allie's perfect little world start to crumble when she starts to take matters into her own hands! I took this book with me everywhere I went. I was mesmerized by this unusual story and Rick Acker's wide array of characters! You won't want to miss this author\u2019s new book...it\u2019ll will make you want to check out his others!Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher.

But really she works as a whistle blower for the state, privately going through books of corporate giants and making them pay.

It's fast-paced and keeps the reader guessing as to how everything will work out. The suspense was created by possible physical danger to the various characters as well as curiosity about the various decisions they will make and how it will all play out. The characters were complex and dealt with realistic problems (though--specifically--not ones most people face). The vivid details of the job and setting brought the story alive in my imagination.For those who care, Allie sometimes drank to excess and lived with her boyfriend. (It's implied they have sex.) She knew he used meth and he knew she disapproved, but she didn't take a strong stand on it until worried for her own neck. But she found some healing and made some hard choices after seeing where the easy ones got her, and I liked who she was by the end.There was no bad language.

It is hard to resist a bargain, but I have so many I am not sure I will ever be able to read them all! To whittle the pile down, I am randomly choosing books. I just finished When The Devil Whistles by Rick Acker. A legal suspense/international thriller, the book was just the ticket for a fast-paced escape novel.Allie Whitman is a professional whistle blower who, through her company Devil to Pay, provides the California Department of Justice with evidence on companies that cheat in their state contracts. Her attorney, Connor Norman, loves helping Allie bring down corrupt businessmen. But Allie gets in over her head when her cover is blown and she is blackmailed into investigating a marine salvage and construction contractor. What starts as a look into some cooked books becomes a deadly game involving foreign governments and terror plots.As a legal suspense novel, When The Devil Whistles follows a standard formula, but Acker diverts from the expected when he introduces terrorists, nuclear weapons and a twisting plot that has the reader guessing. Yes, the plot is a bit implausible (how does the US government not know there is a Soviet-era nuclear sub on the bottom of the sea floor off the west coast?), but it is not so different from action adventures so popular in theaters. I liked the twisting action and I liked the characters. I took the plot devices at face value and just went with the story. The biggest negative in many of the reviews I read was that the book was blatantly Christian, which annoyed or disgusted some of its detractors. What I found was a book with some Christian characters and others not. The Christians were never preachy. In fact their faith was exhibited in natural ways \u2014 they prayed or spoke of God\u2019s help. I would say the message portrayed was subtle.When The Devil Whistles was a fun, quick read and I would definitely read another by Acker.Recommended."}, {"userName": "Dolores Ayotte", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3824205-dolores-ayotte", "userReview": "It took me a couple of chapters to really get into \"When The Devil Whistles\" by Author Rick Acker but I'm sure glad I persisted because this is one great book! First of all, I had never heard of the concept of Qui Tam actions whereby a person takes legal action against a business that is defrauding the U.S. government. If I understand correctly, some businesses do intentionally make false quotes when it comes to the costs of certain government projects. If a whistleblower can prove that the business is guilty of fraud, they can sue that company. If they win the case, they can end up with a percentage of the settlement which can be a hefty sum.In a nutshell, Attorney Connor Norman and Qui Tam investigator Allie Whitman, form the unique and lucrative lawyer/client relationship that brings them together in a thrilling and suspenseful way. Allie Whitman is the undercover whistleblower as she plies her trade by becoming a temp worker in a variety of businesses. With her CPA background, she manages to have access to the required accounting data....with her skills and expertise, she is able to access the situation in every company where she is temporarily employed. If a fraud is taking place, she secretly copies files or invoices that ensure the success of a lawsuit.Allie Whitman and Connor Norman have a great thing going as he makes millions of dollars for his law firm and she financially benefits from a piece of the pie until...something goes terribly wrong. She ends up in way over her head at Deep Seven where she suspects much more than fraud. Allie Whitman risks it all to do the right thing and Connor Norman learns to be more than a lawyer. There are plenty of enticing and unpredictable twists and turns in this well-written suspense novel that are sure to captivate the reader!"}, {"userName": "Delia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1061356-delia", "userReview": "Connor Norman and Allie Whitman have a good thing going with Devil to Pay, Inc.

If I had time to do nothing but read....I would have finished this book in a day. It was a great read......there was NEVER a slow or boring part.......the characters were likeable and they showed that they had the capability to make tough decisions and finish thru to the end...no matter what the end brought. They tried to do what was right and this often would put them in difficult situations. There was also a background storyline of religious beliefs which was a nice addition. Think of Conner Norman....a very wealthy young man who is working as a partner in a very prestigious law firm who goes to church and believes in God and has a kind heart. He doesn't let the family money affect him in the negative way and he tries to make his own way in the world and do what is best in helping others that have wrong done to them. Pretty unusual characterization for a lawyer in general (not saying they are all bad...just that it's not the norm in literature.) Allie is a great gal that really tries to help others and takes very good care of her mother and sister....she just has issues to deal with that is making her life less than it could be.

He takes us inside the world of whistle blowers who uncover contractors defrauding the government on contracts. They sue the contractors and then the Department of Justice steps in and goes after them and the whistle blower then gets a cut of the settlement. Very interesting and then Rick throws in some possible romance, international espionage, nuclear warheads and things really start to heat up. I love the fact that the characters are not perfect, even the Connor who is the Christian makes mistakes and doesn't always act like he should. Allie makes more than her share of mistakes and there are consequences - lots of them.

I recommend this book, but make sure your brain is on, you will need it. : )"}, {"userName": "Nenette", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156661-nenette", "userReview": "As Mr. Rick Acker wrote in his acknowledgment, a lot of research was done for the non-legal parts; and that shows. \u00a0There's nothing better than a well-researched fiction. \u00a0The events themselves may be borne out of a creative imagination, but a realistic \u00a0background and setting lends much to the credibility of the story. \u00a0I like this legal thriller that's also a Christian fiction. \u00a0It thrills but it does not preach. \u00a0The preaching part is up to the reader.The author's style of leaving the height of one scene and switching to another is cinematic, I can imagine watching it. \u00a0The switch is subtle enough to not irk the reader, and it adds to the thrill.Recommended to those who like to find nuggets of life lessons while teetering on the edge of their seats."}, {"userName": "Lori Henrich", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5703400-lori-henrich", "userReview": "Allie is what is known as a whistle blower.

Allie is desperate, one of the companies she goes to work for figured out who she was and sends her to a competing company to find fault with them. If she doesn't they will expose her. She decides to plant fake invoices, turn them in and run for the hills. But it might be too late to hide.This was a fast paces and easy to read legal thriller. I liked the characters and the plot line. The author tries to put as much truth as he can in the basic plots so that the fiction part feels more believable."}, {"userName": "Camy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/803525-camy", "userReview": "This book pulled me in right off the bat and it's a great, fast-paced thriller. The story premise is unique but not so odd that I didn't understand what was going on. My only wish is that there was more romance in the book, but that's only because I'm a die-hard romance reader and I'm used to books with 50% romance, 50% suspense. This book is meant to appeal to both women and men readers, and I'm sure most men would want less than 50% romance. :)As a disclaimer, I have to say that I was honored to be able to preview this book in the line edit stage and help Rick with the romance thread, which was already there and very subtly woven into the story. I only suggested a few added sentences to enhance it.Overall, a really entertaining story."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9386842-sue", "userReview": "I really like this book. It was well written and the characters seemed life like.The book starts out like it is about two different stories but as the book progresses you find out that the the two parts are related and eventually turn out to be one big cover up.This book is a real page turner and keeps your interest. I wanted to keep reading the book because I wanted to find out what happened to the main characters. There always seems to be something going on with the story.
