Somehow I just expected myself not to like it. I had \"Glass Houses\" sitting on my shelf for months before I finally picked it up but as it turned out, I fell in love immediately. And who would have thought, 9 books later I am still loving it. I guess what makes this series one of my favorites are the characters and their close friendship. I just love the entire gang, how they always stick together and how they make up their own little family. I love their house, how it seems to have a mind of its own and how it's comforting and protecting its residents. And then there's Myrnin of course. Crazy Myrnin, who always makes me laugh. These books are just full of interesting and loveable characters!Ok, enough of the general rambling. What to say about this 9th installment without giving anything away? Just like all the other books in this series this was a nice and quick read, with some good laughs and a healthy dose of drool-worthy Shane moments. The story itself was gripping and kept me turning pages quickly. There were some small things that bugged me (plotwise) but when it comes to the Morganville Vampires I somehow seem to be able to overlook the occasional flaw.All in all, I enjoyed Ghost town immensely even though it made me cry and ends on a sad note, which I\u2019m not very fond of. I know I've wreaked some havoc with my comments (sorry Nic and Tina) but I really can't say anything else about this book before you guys haven't read it, too. But don't worry too much, I'm sure you're going to love it :)"}, {"userName": "is mee... kissa", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2565113-is-mee-kissa", "userReview": "yay! more of myrnin!!!what can I say.. i like the guyKissa's Reviewah Myrnin... you insane twisted vampire, you have really screwed up this time...Okay, i don't want to give any spoilers out, so i'll keep it as informationally non-informational as possible.. if that makes senseSo, basically, Morganville is still it's weird, scary, vampire-fied town, but this book in the series really gets into some scary stuff... i'm talking brain in a jar freaky... i mean really?! but that's why i love the place: its insane vampires.Book 9 of the Morganville Vampire series really starts going when Claire gets into some trouble (of course). She's got to get punished, which i find completely unjustified by the way, but Amelie has got to \"do what's best for Morganville.\" Hence comes the 'working with her half-crazy vampire boss' part. This is all pretty early on, it's the basis of the rest of the plot, so pay attention to it... at which point Claire sleeps in Myrnin's bed... *wolf whistle* And then we move on from there and the real complication begins, and Claire finds herself alone and feels like she's not really apart of Morganville at all... confusing, i know, but i promised no spoilers!Oh God, the madness in that place never ends... i'd really rather not spill any more details, cos i wouldn't want to give out any spoilers, but that place is so crazy, and now Claire has to fix something that's messing with memories in the wrong way.. which is just plain terrifying.. Characters: Amelie is still mysterious, Oliver is still the sarcastic (for me: loveable) jerk he's always been, Myrnin is still the good 'ol most insane guy on the block (and we love him for it). Same story for everyone else, not much has changed with the characters, except we sort of catch a tiny, miniscule, punicated glipse of Oliver at a vulnerable moment, and even a bit of past information about Myrnin is revealed.... but i aint tellin you any o that! read it!Overall: Ghost Town i'm thinking, is one of my favourites in the series... it has heaps of Myrnin in it and his fluffy bunny fang slippers, and the plot doesn't crawl at a snail's pace (thank god!)... it's another typical Morganville adventure that proves that Caine still has some good ideas in that head of hers, and that Claire and the gang just cannot catch a break, with a whole lotta action, a few make-out sessions (ooo), and some humour in between, plus of course scenes with Myrnin... sum it all up = Ghost Town"}, {"userName": "Literary Ames {Against GR Censorship}", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2109885-literary-ames-against-gr-censorship", "userReview": "Oh, Myrnin. Myrnin, Myrnin, Myrnin. Excuse my language but you fucked up, dude. I worried for your sanity and for your life. There were times when I loved you and when I hated you. You've caused so much trouble, so much pain and suffering and yet I still care about you. Even on that last page when my jaw dropped after my little fit of worry over what you may have done to yourself.Ghost Town really begins when Claire stakes and kills a vamp whilst trying to rescue Eve and is sentenced to no sleep or rest of any kind until she's fixed the machine that runs Morganville, previously run by Ada. And while she manages it by the skin of her teeth, Myrnin tweaks it for his own purposes which causes both humans and vampires, one by one, to lose their memories of the last 3 years. As a result, all hell breaks loose with the hero in the end being someone you wouldn't expect but it was a redeeming act. Only the last page twists things to the point where I'm not sure whether Myrnin's actions were good (as it may provide much needed closure and no one was killed) or just plain bad but I worry about the effect it will have on a couple of the characters.I know this took me a few days to finish but this is no reflection of the book itself but rather a severe lack of free time. I enjoyed it more than Kiss of Death partly because there was less cringe-worthy kissy-wissy lovey-doveyness between Shane and Claire, instead these kinds of moments were made to be sweet and endearing. In fact, a couple of my favourites are when Shane starts falling for Claire again when he can't remember any of their previous time together and when Claire does the same. I want to quickly comment on the Myrnin-Claire possibility which I've previously noted in earlier reviews. This possibility is noted by several characters in this book plus Myrnin is unusually kind and caring towards Claire and makes comparisons between her and Ada who he admits was his lover. Also, Claire sleeps in his bed! Not that I want this to happen, I love Shane but I just think he might make a move on her at some point in the future.Another thing I loved about this book was the politics, specifically the relationship between Amelie and Oliver and the town. It's complicated but one of the lessons I've learned is never be complacent when you're in a position of power, it leads to humiliating circumstances. And, um, never fall in love with your rival?Also included in my UK edition was a short story called \n'Worth Living For'\n from Shane's perspective set between Fade Out and Kiss of Death involving Michael and Bishop. The story sees Shane approached and asked to secretly follow Michael when it looks like he may be helping Bishop who has escaped and on the run. It's not a great story and isn't important to the overall story in the main books. And if you were wondering, the title 'Worth Living For' refers to Claire, of course. ;)"}, {"userName": "Nic", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2813423-nic", "userReview": "You bookers ~points to Kim and Jessica~ lied to me.

I loved Ghost Town and after waiting six long months for this book and devouring it in a few short hours, I\u2019m back to anticipating the release of the next installment. Bite Club can\u2019t get here fast enough!!There was plenty of action in this book and squee-worthy Claire and Shane moments that had me re-reading paragraphs at a time. Myrnin made me laugh, kept me on edge and broke my heart all in a matter of a few hundred pages. As always, I never know what to expect from him besides a shoe collection that has me searching the internet for his style of slippers. Shane was perfect as always in this book. I love his relationship with Claire and his friendship with Eve and Michael. Michael, oh Michael, there never seems to be enough of him in any of the books. What a great set of characters that blend and contrast in all the right ways. Ghost Town doesn\u2019t waste any time taking off with a heavy dose of insane and wild. Claire Danvers is developing a new system to maintain Morganville\u2019s defenses, but the result has unexpected consequences. As soon as the system is activated humans and vampires in the town of Morganville suffer from memory lapse, which creates a full on epidemic of hysteria. While the town is turned upside down, the power shift between Amelie and Oliver causes additional chaos where Claire, Shane, Michael and Eve must work together to bring order back to their town all the while trying to cope with their own memory loss.Reading these books puts me in a setting that feels familiar and full of crazy, which feels about right\u2026 every single time. There\u2019s no denying\u2026 I\u2019m addicted and I want more. If you\u2019re a fan of vampire lore and love your stories filled with wild adventure, this series is a MUST and Ghost Town does not disappoint!Favorite Quotes Mostly Shane quotes BTW. :)\"I\u2019m not dropping my pants,\u201d Shane said. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d say that up front.\u201d'What\u2019s snogging?\u201d Shane asked. \u201cRidiculous displays of inappropriate affection in front of me. Roughly translated. And what are you doing here?\u201d Myrnin was genuinely offended, Claire realized. Not good.\"You are not a ninja, Shane.\" Claire said. \"I watched all the movies. I just haven't gotten the certificate from the correspondence course yet.\" Eve looked at Claire. \"Really?

Myrnin had a pimp hat. Just when I didn't think he could surpass the vampire bunny slippers. I heart me some Myrnin. 3.5 stars. If I hadn't been so bored with the first half of Ghost Town, this surely would have been a 4 star read for me because the last half had me glued to the virtual pages. So much awesome was crammed into those final chapters. I think the slow start/hectic finish might be a Morganville series thing because I've noticed that most of what I find entertaining about these books often tends to happen in the second half. It's entirely possible that there might be some pacing issues at work here. Oh well though. I was so surprised, impressed, and repelled by the solution to the \"memory loss\" issue that I'm excited to tear into book 10 to see how one certain person is going to handle THAT fallout. This is a good thing, especially considering how long it took for me to read book 9 after finishing book 8 (it was awhile).

It's always a blast reading a Morganville book and I always miss them when there gone.So, what's up this time in Morganville? Why, memory lost of course...;)While Myrnin and Claire tweaked the machine to get the boundaries back up and running, I think either Claire's sleep deprived-ness or Myrnin's...well Myrnin might have missed a step.Bringing the town of Morganville back three years before and driving them down a notch to crazier, it's up to Claire to set things right before her memories goes poof like the rest of them.Ghost Town is another awesome addition to the world of crazy plots and insane characters. I had a lot of fun with this since it was interesting to see how things would pan out with the foursome and see how they'd interact with each other now. Some of it was very sad and I really felt bad for Shane and what he had to relive. Same goes for Myrnin he broke my heart with some of the touching things he did. \"I'll be your hands\". He may have mucked things up pretty good in this one, but I absolutely love that whack-o!!Lots of Shane-Swoon worthy moments here, even while his memory was affected he's still...Shane and I simply adore all his nakedness him to bits.While these books are very much out there it truly doesn't matter to me in the least. They are entertaining, fun and quirky as hell. I love that there is always something up in Morganville, but by the time the book is done, it's solved (more or less). I get my dose of crazy without having to pull my hair out with the cliffies. It's just one of the best things about this series, besides, it's freaken addicting!I'll never get tired of there wit and banter that Caine flawlessly delivers in ever book she pens.But that ending? Oh.Crap. I so don't wanna know how that black-hole of a secret is gonna effect my favorite couple.

Picking up right after the last book, Claire and her friends need to save the town yet again after a fix for the computer system running Morganville doesn't go as planned and begins causing the residents to lose their memories. A part of me enjoys this series then a part tends to think it's getting a bit repetitive at this point. Ghost Town was one of the better books of the series as some have seemed to drag quite a bit but this one wasn't too bad in that regard. However, I do think it gets a bit silly by now that everyone seems to keep rushing off into danger and some of the action seems to be getting repeated over and over. In the end, decided on 3.5 stars for this installment. Still kind of funny and entertaining but I wonder how there's actually any new ideas to keep reading with so many books to go."}, {"userName": "Terri \u2665 (aka Mrs. Christian Grey)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6014919-terri-aka-mrs-christian-grey", "userReview": "Quick review:Cover: Better Rating:  PG-13 Thumbs Up:  4.5Overall: This book surprised me in a good wayCharacters: Well WrittenPlot: What will you do when everyone around you is forgetting who you arePage Turner: Yes Series Cont.?

This version doesn't include someone's brain in a jar, of course. One small detail: It's flawed and instead of wiping people's memories after leaving Morganville, it just erases (almost) everybody's memories from the past 3 years.Result: Myrnin is back to being a cruel lunatic and won't let anybody near his machine (he still thinks it's Ada in there), Amelie and Oliver don't get along, Michael refuses to believe he's a vampire (and nearly gets killed when he walks out into the sunlight), Shane thinks his sister it still alive, Eve thinks she still lives at home, and... nobody remembers who Claire is, except for Oliver. He and Claire seem to be the only ones left with their memories intact. And 3 of The Core Four don't know they are double dating and living together.I enjoyed this book, but in my opinion, those 4 people got back together way too soon. It seemed forced and way too easy. (soul mates, anyone?) Michael and Eve look into each other's eyes and a chapter later they are back to making the neighbors blush. Same thing goes for Shane and Claire, Claire just needs to bat her eyelashes a few times and next thing you know they are a couple again, more or less.Claire keeps her memories, until very last second, but then Shane's father sacrifices himself and blows up the machine and: All is well again in Morganville. Except for Myrnin, who feels like hell and gets replaced by Claire. Who makes up for it by putting Shane's father's brain in a jar.

Myrnin is the craziest character ever and I love him, in a weird way ;) But then Claire realizes that something is off with the people and she thinks the machine is causing it. People loose their memory and forget about the last 3 years. This is not only sad but dangerous! Claire has to act fast, but again Vampire politics come in the way.

Es ist halt nur so extrem auf Jugendbuch getrimmt. Die Story und die Charaktere sind n\u00e4mlich richtig gut ausgelegt und wenn man da mehr in die Tiefe gegangen w\u00e4re und vielleicht auch mal ein bisschen blutiger und/oder brutaler geworden w\u00e4re, wenn man halt einfach diese Disney-Schiene weggelassen h\u00e4tte \u2026 Alter Falter, wat h\u00e4tte das werden k\u00f6nnen!Dadurch fehlt mir das gewisse Etwas, die Spannung, die Tragik. Die Protagonisten schlagen sich mit Problem herum die alles andere als leicht zu verdauen sind und vor Potenzial bald platzen, aber der Fokus liegt einfach nicht auf der Auseinandersetzung und der Entwicklung der L\u00f6sung und wie sich die Charaktere mit dem Problem weiterentwickeln, welche Beziehungen entstehen, welche Ereignisse sie heimsuchen, sondern auf der endg\u00fcltigen Probleml\u00f6sung im Disney-Stil. Alles ist nach 300 Seiten wieder sch\u00f6n, alle haben es geschafft, alle lieben sich wieder und im n\u00e4chsten Teil kommt dann das n\u00e4chste Problem. Des Weiteren glaube ich dass die Anzahl von 15 B\u00fcchern doch etwas zu hoch gegriffen ist.

As usual with any of the books in this series, I got pulled into the story and didn\u2019t want to stop listening. It had just been long enough since I read the first eight books almost back to back, to completely engage me all over again. Morganville, the town that these books take place in, is a town run by vampires. A town where human\u2019s can\u2019t leave, and where the taxes they pay are at the blood bank. Great premise!Claire is still working with Myrnin, otherwise known as an on again/off again crazy, very old vampire-also considered by many as the best character of these books.They have been working on getting the machine that takes care of the town back up and running. No matter that he thinks that using Claires brain would be just the thing to make the machine work. Of course, that would mean that Claire would no longer have a body. Since they had to do away with Ada, the last person that had her brain attached to the machine, Myrnin, has been grieving for her. Of course, as always, Claire is involved in all the inner workings of the town. Not because she\u2019s a vampire-she isn\u2019t-but because not only is she a teenage genius, but she has become a sort of favorite of the town founder, Amelie-but not always in a good way. When the problem with the machine is solved, you would think things would be smooth sailing for our feisty heroine. That couldn\u2019t be further than the truth. It never is in Morganville.Once again, this author has come up with another intricate plot to keep Claire, her boyfriend Shane, and her friends Eve and Michael, right smack in the middle of another mystery and more than enough action, and yes, even more deaths of both the human and vampire kind. College students attend the Rave from Hell, and of course Claire, Shane, and Eve are right in the middle of it. Not to mention that everybody seems to be having lapses of memory. Something weird, or rather weirder than usual, is happening in Morganville.Narrator Cynthia Holloway was very good, as far as the female voices, but her male voices weren\u2019t the best, in my opinion. She just didn\u2019t make her voice go deep enough. However, it wasn\u2019t that big of a problem, and I would listen to one of these by her again. Like I said, I was completely drawn into the story, and that has to be partly due to the narrator.These books are not only for young adults, but for anyone that enjoys good writing, plotting, wonderful characters,a sweet(sometimes lustful romance), and snark, all surrounded by the horror of living in a town controlled by vampires. Ms. Caine is an excellent storyteller, and these books should be a must read for anyone that enjoys a paranormal story.Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2614253-brandi-kosiner-brandi-breathes-books", "userReview": "I wanted to read this one because it has been my personal pleasure in the last of 2014 (read this one end of December). I love the vampires, the relationship between our main character Claire, who is wicked smart and able to roll with the punches, and her hot boyfriend Shane. It has been heating up a lot and I love each book where they become closer through shared experiences. The mad scientist Myrnin is always fun and surprising to read about. The leader of the town Amelie and 2nd in command Oliver always are mysterious and their motives and goals seemingly ever changing. I love the plots and has been so fun to read.  The plot and pacing in Ghost Town did not disappoint. I read half of it in one night and would have read more if my meds didn't knock me out like a blow to the head. Claire finds herself in horrible situations again with impossible choices. It really tipped the power, and made her doubt if the new gained freedoms were all for show. And then the unthinkable happened and I was like oh my gosh. We learned so much from this one encounter and I felt such at a loss because some of the things that I thought wouldn't change in the series did.  Claire shows her raw intelligence and will power to survive and protect her friends once again in this one. And I keep on admiring her ingenuity, and loyalty. We get to see to the heart of some of the characters when their memories are stripped three years. We see their actions as they struggle to deal with the losses that they are feeling all anew, the people they are now surrounded by where the relationship dynamics have changed if they even remember them at all.  Most of all though, the theme of redemption ran through this one. There are some sacrifices I never saw coming as well as alliances formed that aren't really expected. The action and character development was non-stop and it kept me entertained and engaged.  The ending was shocking and even though I probably should have seen parts of it coming, I didn't and when I reached the last page, I immediately wanted the next book in my hands.Bottom Line: Beloved characters facing all new challenges and range of emotions"}, {"userName": "Mello \u2763 Illium \u272eHarry\u272e \u2600Myrnin\u2600 Torin Ichimaru", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6981505-mello-illium-harry-myrnin-torin-ichimaru", "userReview": "I stayed up way too late reading this. I couldn't stop. I just had to know what caused this new problem, although I'd known it was Myrnin, somehow and I just had to know how Claire was going to fix it.Honestly, though, why does Rachel Caine insist on torturing Shane? That guy cannot win.Morganville was once again in chaos. Everyone was losing three years worth of memories and while this happened, everyone closest to Claire turned on her because they just couldn't remember who the hell she was. I honestly could not figure out wth Claire was going to do to fix this. She thought it was her fault, but turns out, it wasn't at all. I'd even thought that maybe in her fatigue (because of Amelie's punishment) that perhaps she'd messed something up. Turns out, it was Myrnin's grief over Ada that brought this about. Just like Claire, I knew it was a horrible idea on Amelie's part that Myrnin be the vamp he's mind was interfaced with that machine. Boy were we both right.In the end, Claire's allies came from two of the least likely people. Luckily, even though Shane lost three years and was pretty awful to Claire at first, he came around. You could tell that he just knew something was still there. Poor Michael, though. Forgetting you're a vampire and walking out into the sun. That was just awful.To fix things, the most unexpected person made a huge sacrifice to set things back to as normal as Morganville could get. Too bad Myrnin and that same person's brain ended up burdening Claire with a sick secret. I love Myrnin, but I can see why Claire resents and even hates him at times. I know why he told her about it. He'd wanted to do things this way the entire time. If he and Claire had just listened to each other, maybe that bit of madness wouldn't have happened. Still, if Shane ever finds out, I expect Armageddon."}, {"userName": "kitty cu\u00e9", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4222059-kitty-cu", "userReview": "Morganville Vampire is one of the, if not the BEST, series I have ever read.I have been hook since the first book The Glass House. I love all the character especially Claire and Shane fallow by Eve and Michael, which are room-mates.If you LOVE book with romance and paranormal stuff, this is definitely your book.It's about a town full and ruled by vampires where this girl who goes to high-school early because she is really smart. Well, lets just says she steps out of line with Queen Bitch. She is forced (by her own) to move from the dorms if she wants to survive. Little she new that living out of the school and in the town will free her from Monica but not from the physics, blood thirst vampire.She lives with her new room mates which one is her hot boyfriend.In this book they face a lot of challenges, when the machine Myrin creates doesn't with ought a brain and she is definitely not putting her in a jar. She is made to fix it, when she does thing don't go good just worst. Everybody forgetting three years, not her she wan't in Morganville at that time. Even her best friends and dear boyfriend. Apparently he had something with Monica and he doesn't think he is her type..Thanks God everything ends well or does it?If you need hell message me I love to help!"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/251943-kelly", "userReview": "One of the things that I've consistently enjoyed about this series is that I don't ever feel like I'm overwhelmed by how heavy the reading is. Is it because the writing is extremely accessible? Is it because the plot is very fast-paced? Maybe it's both. I just know that I sit down to read these and I come out of it with a smile.Part of it comes from the characters. Claire is strong, smart and brave. She is willing to put herself on the line consistently for those around her. Not just her friends. Everyone in town. For Myrnin. For Amelie. Even for Oliver, who she mostly loathes.I really enjoyed the arc in this book. It took the events of the last two books and made them mean something. And we were given resolution to several little threads that had been hanging around. That's always nice. The characters, especially Claire, continue to grow. Even the vampires are branching out and trying to change.I loved the book, I love the series.

Rachel has pumped up the creepy factor in Morganville to 1000 in Ghost Town! If you thought the vampires in Morganville were devious, evil, kill-all-humans before, just wait until you see them now! This book has twice the random attacks, twice the RUN FOR YOUR LIFE moments, and best of all TWICE THE MYRNIN!!!!For those of you out there with an undying love of Claire's super crazy boss, Myrnin, you will be excited to know that Myrnin is once again front and center for Ghost Town! But sorry guys, that's all the spoilery info I'm giving out today! Just trust me when I say that October 26th you need to RUN, not walk, to your nearest bookstore and get the newest addition to the Morganville Vampires! Rachel has,once again,out-done herself! Ghost Town was exciting, creepy, riveting, and,most of all, filled with Myrnin!!!

Mirroring some of the other books, however, the idea wasn\u2019t played out as well as I had hoped for. In all honesty, the way certain details were focused upon too much (cue my annoyance with certain characters) left me somewhat annoyed. Despite this it really was one of the better ideas for the series, I just wish things had played out somewhat differently.Alas, we\u2019re back to my comment from my reviews of the other books of Myrnin saving my sanity when certain things grew annoying."}, {"userName": "Kirsty (Amethyst Bookwyrm)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7436809-kirsty-amethyst-bookwyrm", "userReview": "This and my other reviews can be found at http://amethystbookwyrm.blogspot.co.uk/Claire is ordered to repair the boundary that stops people from leaving Morganville after she breaks one of Morganville\u2019s serious rules.

I cannot say too much without giving the storyline away but I love the relationships in Ghost Town, and how Claire has to be the strongest one in the group, which is a nice change.
