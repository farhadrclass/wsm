And, if not for the limitations of library-lending, I might have inched through this one at an even slower pace (giving me ample opportunity to rock quietly in the corner in terror). Things didn't start out this way. I tore into the first several chapters of \n  Future Crimes: Everything Is Connected, Everyone Is Vulnerable, and What We Can Do About It \nwith my usual aplomb. But there's only so much risk one can absorb before declaring defeat. Author and former cybercrime cop, \n  Marc Goodman\n, can't be faulted for the breadth of threats out there. However, by the time I got to the What We Can Do About It sections (the last 50 pages or so), I felt decidedly worn down. So, take this review with a grain of salt, because it's a good book with a whole boatload of information that's often ignored.The Future Is NowGoodman starts off by stating that he is well aware of, and is very much for the wonders of modern technology\u2014 and I'm with him on that (as noted in my review of \n  \n    Nation of Enemies\n  \n). It's not about a showdown, but we need to face the changing techno-landscape with an attitude akin to that of Hawaiians regarding the ocean; one of respect and awareness that, while beautiful, it's more powerful than you can imagine, and can have brutal consequences. \n  Furthermore, we need to be thinking about \n  Moore's Outlaws*\n now (and also yesterday, and the day before that), which will require effort, since we're not used to thinking in exponential terms. Also, said outlaws (and their corporate equivalent, which he refers to as \u201cCrime Inc.\u201d) are already outpacing us in a serious way (the whole \n  Silk Road\n affair is barely a sneak peek). \n  Opening Pandora's Virtualbox*Things get overwhelming quickly. As nefarious as the \n  DarkNet\n may be, cryptocurrency and onion routers seem like reasonable precautions once Goodman starts discussing just how little privacy we have, given the \n  digital exhaust\n we produce just tooling around the regular old interwebs on the daily. With the \n  Internet of Things\n, we invite more and more connected devices into our home, all of which are apparently quite hackable (though I'm not really ready to start worrying about pedophiles storing illicit images on my Nest just yet). \n   \u2018Bots & \u2018BorgsFirst things first \u2014 \n  robots\n. Though no definition of the term satisfies all parties involved, robots are basically machines that can be programmed to carry out tasks (with varying levels of autonomy). The world is already chock full of 'em, though not necessarily in a \u201crise of the machines\u201d kind of way. However, just because the machines aren't thinking on their own, doesn't mean they're not dangerous. Malware and malicious actors aside, the human error and our \n  \u201cin screen we trust\u201d\n attitude has been and will continue to be a problem. There are plenty of examples, but I think the recent \n  \n    Robot Grabs, Crushes Man To Death\n  \n incident at a German Volkswagen factory sums it up pretty well.\n  My only beef with the Goodman's treatment of \n  industrial robots\n is that he kind of neglects Bayesian counterfactuals. It's been awhile since I've read The Jungle, but I'm pretty sure that factory safety was a problem long before Roomba came along. But, the remote threat is new(ish), and, as robots become increasingly autonomous, we've got some serious thinking about \n  \n    Asimov's Laws\n  \n ahead of us. \n  Cyborg\n is another somewhat ill-defined term, though I'll go with the definition that doesn't include \n  glasses\n and/or \n  peg-legs.\n Goodman's \n  bionics\n section, \n  \u201cHackable You,\u201d\n does discuss the advantages and opportunities presented by these technologies. The problem, as suggested by the title, is that these computers inside of us aren't all that secure\u2014 a problem compounded by the fact that updating the hardware involves cutting people open. \n  And then, of course, there are the big fears that could potentially make \n  \u201cSurviving Progress\u201d\n a tricky feat. Whether we're talking 'bots or 'borgs, a lack of foresight could doom us all. \n  The Final FrontierI can't blame you if your first inclination is to throw your hands in the air and declare defeat. Goodman suggests practicing better \n  \u201ccyber hygiene\u201d\n\u2014 a public health approach that actually makes quite a bit of sense. After all, you can't unilaterally protect your information if your friends are running around giving Candy Crush access to their address book, while posting and tagging photos of you on facebook willy nilly (though my advice would be to ditch that friend).This book's probably better than I'm giving it credit for, an easy \n  7/10 stars\n, and maybe more once I wrap my head around it all. But the look on Krieger's face, below, pretty much captures my feelings upon finishing.\n   _________________________________* Goodman's super into wordplay, so brace yourself for that."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7896231-daniel", "userReview": "This book\u2019s prose... It\u2019s got more mixed metaphors than a 50-car pile up of smoothie blenders has spilled milk, and more cliches than a plethora of dystopian futures unfolding like bad origami. It\u2019s got a strictly-defined plethora of the word \u2018plethora\u2019 loosely-defined. Its deeply beheld love of adverbs and concomitant utilization of exponentially and stupefyingly complicating adjectives is impossibly difficult to avoid, as is its blind insistence on using the word \u2018data\u2019 in the plural, even in instances when any reasonable native speaker would use it in the singular. Over and over it repeats its assertions and claims, redundantly. It is both an alarm and a wake-up call, a warning and a dire prediction, a call to arms and to action. And it is very, very fond of quoting Sun Tzu.I\u2019ve not even gotten to the content yet! It\u2019s repetitive. A little editing could've shaved a quarter if not half the length off this thing, without sacrificing any information. Many of its claims are obviously overblown. Wired Magazine has a corrective on the book's take on the Dark Web (\u201cThe Dark Web as You Know It Is a Myth by Joseph Cox, http://www.wired.com/2015/06/dark-web...), and the book's general take on the vulnerability of our entire digital infrastructure is better stated in a few hundred words here: https://medium.com/message/everything... (\u201cEverything Is Broken\u201d by Quinn Norton\u201d).And yet! The book\u2019s first ~2/3 presents a lot of content that might be a surprise, even to tech folks who think they're somewhat in-the-know about information security. Despite all the books\u2019 flaws, it might actually be worthwhile to folks interested in privacy, cybercrime, and the technological vulnerability of... just about everything."}, {"userName": "Jason Anthony ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20174779-jason-anthony", "userReview": "Stages of reading \"Future Crimes...\" by Marc Goodman:(1) Wow, this is fascinating material.

However, there is a dark underside to all these positives. In the rush to market with web and internet based services there are often many compromises with security, and it is through these loopholes that Crime Inc., as Goodman describes them, take the opportunity to slip in.Scouring his vast database of crime cases he brings us tales of identity theft, financial theft and how criminals are now using modern technology to extend their reach. There are stories of gangs printing guns from the latest 3D printer technology, how servers are brought down by DoS attacks, how they can active webcams and baby monitors remotely to spy of people and capture images for blackmail. They have found ways to hack pacemakers too, bringing the terrifying reality of lethal voltages being sent to your own medical equipment. Even drones are starting to be extensively used by crooks, not only for surveillance, but fitting them with weapons brings a whole new deadly terror; Skynet is nearly here.Even who you would think are the good guys, are not entirely innocent. The main reason that services provided by Google and Facebook are free is that you are the product. They mine your likes and searches, the results of which are sold on to data analysis companies who are looking for trends and targeted advertising to offer to companies. This starts the very moment you sign up, as the lengthy terms and conditions that no one ever reads not only claim all your data as theirs, but also seek to eliminate all responsibility and comeback against theft of your data. So far, so bad.The future really does not look too rosy. Coming soon is the internet of things, where almost all devices in your home from lightbulbs to fridges will have some sort of access to the internet. This means the advent of the smart home is finally upon us, and that you will be able to control various things from your smartphone, even when not there. Great, or so you\u2019d think; control over your home with a simple touch. But fairly often these devices have precious little security and offer the easiest route into your home network by an experienced hacker.All of this is frankly terrifying. Our society is now totally dependent on these web based technologies and systems for essential infrastructure elements like power, water and security. These systems are all very well and offer the companies that use them financial advantages, but the big problem with all of this that there is precious little security and no resilience to cyber-attacks. These historically have come from hackers, but now others are getting in on the act with the first known attacks originating from states. Goodman offers us a bleak future, but he does have some suggestions on how we as individuals can improve our security even something as simple as covering the camera on your laptop when you are not using it, to using twin security login methods. He does point a finger at the software industry though, not only do they need to raise their game and produce software that is less sieve, but they also need to start accepting responsibility when there are breaches and not washing their hands of it. If you are brave enough, it is worth reading for anyone who is interested in technology; 3.5 stars overall."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3356446-carol", "userReview": "Future Crimes: Everyone Is Vulnerable And What We Can Do About Its by Marc Goodman is an amazingly well researched book about cybercrime. He was only 28 and an investigative sergeant in LAPD when he was asked if he knew how to use Word Spell. That was in 1995. He did and he got the job for investing computer crime. That was the birth of computer crime with pages and cell phone now it has grown into a huge industry. And it is going to get worse. Plenty of research has gone into this book and none of it is boring. So even though it is a long book, you will be entranced until the end.This book covers more venues of computer crime than I ever imagined. Goodman takes us into the underworld of the Internet. This is the world of underground crime. Why are we so vulnerable? Why are we so trusting? This book is frightening because is telling the reality of the new world. If you get scared reading through all the avenues of computer crime, just hang around until you get to the last two chapters. That one will give you and businesses ways to prevent fraud and increase protection. Password safety, many people use the same password for many accounts? What if you did and someone hacked you Facebook account, then with the additional information on your profile they can get into your bank account, credit cards and more.There is a paradox about the computer, even though it is extremely helpful, it can be dangerous when the wrong people use it for their gain. In the last two chapters, the author explored what can be done to make us safer and how we can use computers to help mankind.In the last two chapters, the author explored what can be done to make us safer and how we can use computers to help mankind.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the hazards of cyberspace and also how to protect themselves from them.I received an Advance Reading Copy from Vine Amazon but that in no way influenced my thoughts or feelings in this review."}, {"userName": "Natalie Vellacott", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34178791-natalie-vellacott", "userReview": "I wasn't sure if I would make it through this six hundred page technological \"thriller\" borrowed from my brother-in-law who works in IT security. I'm sure he would understand a lot more of it than I did. Future Crimes gives the lay reader a glimpse into the criminal world of the dark net. It is unbelievable that the internet that we see and use everyday is just a tiny proportion of what is out there. Even more shocking is that cyber criminals have set up sites similar to Ebay and Amazon where they offer criminal services ranging from child porn to drugs, and guns to hacking. Worryingly, the author, who clearly has inside knowledge, claims that the authorities are always lagging behind in the race to identify security threats. It makes sense due to their hands being tied by bureaucracy and regulation that criminals obviously ignore. The author documents numerous case details of crime and cyber attacks all of which turn this possibly mundane subject matter into a page turner.The author exposes our own lackadaisical attitudes towards online security pointing out that the majority of people still use 123456 or password as their password and that over 50% of people use the same password across all of their sites. He warns that our household gadgets will soon be so interconnected that they will control us and actually be spying on us and reporting back. Before you think this is the stuff of conspiracy theories, he provides real life examples of where this has actually happened and is happening including the inside stories for many of the recent cyber attacks that we have seen in the media.I read the first two thirds of this book a few months ago and have just finished it, therefore I can't comment extensively on the language although I think I recall a few swear words but not a lot. There are also some details of some of the crimes which may cause some readers to become afraid of the dangers of an attack or worried about where things are heading.I'm surprised that I found a book probably written for computer nerds fascinating, but it's true. The only annoying thing is that the author used the word EXPONENTIALLY about a thousand times. It was as common as a regular author would use \"that\" or \"this.\" How a decent editor didn't pick this up I don't know but I'm sure other readers will have noticed it. It's irritating.If I was a non-Christian, this book would definitely make me paranoid and I would start to feel as if the threats are impossible and that everything is heading for a big final conclusion resulting in the end of the world. As a Christian, I know that that is what will happen in the end when Jesus returns and that maybe God will choose to use the downfall of our technological systems to accomplish His purposes. As Christians we have nothing to fear from Future Crimes--we need to reassure others and help them find true eternal security rather than temporary online security which has limited value...."}, {"userName": "W.

Hopefully, with a bit of reflection, you might not take such drastic action but you will be inspired to modify your online behaviour and encourage your friends and colleagues to do likewise.This is a really and truly depressing read, yet the author makes it incredibly interesting and you have to pinch yourself that this isn\u2019t a fiction book that has gone just a bit too far. You can feel giddy trying to keep up with the sheer diversity of online crimes, whether they are hackers wiping a lifetime of irreplaceable pictures of someone\u2019s child just for kicks or state-sponsored organisations hacking into a system to gain commercial information or a military advantage.The author has no need to over-egg the pudding either and make things up. The sheer facts and statistics do this and much more besides. Remember, these are only the events that have come to light! So much more is hidden, whether as an attempt to protect a company\u2019s reputation or, perhaps more alarmingly, because nobody knows\u2026 not even the victim. This reviewer had to read this part of the book several times for the sheer scale of matters to sink in: \u201cThe landmark survey carried out by Verizon business services, working in conjunction with the U.S. Secret Service, the Dutch National Police and the U.K. Police Central E-crimes Unit, reported that on average 62% of the intrusions against business took at least two months to detect. A similar study by Trustwave Holdings revealed that the average time from the initial breach of a company\u2019s network until discovery of the intrusion was an alarming 210 days. That\u2019s nearly seven months for an attacker\u2014whether organized crime, the competition, or a foreign government\u2014to creep around unfettered in a corporate network stealing secrets, gaining competitive intelligence, breaching financial systems, and pilfering customers\u2019 personally identifiable information, such as their credit card numbers.\u201dThis is staggering, mind blowing and alarming. Yet this subject is something this reviewer has a more than passing interest in following so it is not entirely unchartered territory. A lot of these crimes start from a relatively \u201csmall\u201d thing. A compromised password, an insecure computer system or even a user clicking on an \u201cinnocent-looking\u201d link or attachment. Then the rest is history\u2026 Sometimes the intrusion is to steal information, other times it is just to \u201cvandalise\u201d the system and create mayhem or for a joke.Is that not enough? We are being \u201cspied on\u201d under the guise of convenience or providing a service. We don\u2019t actually know big the problem is, what is happening to our information and what people are doing with it. An online dictionary site, for example, has at one stage installed 234 different tracking files on ONE visitor\u2019s computer during ONE visit. Who reads the online privacy policy or terms of service document? Very few and the companies know it. The book notes a Carnegie Mellon University study that shows the average American encounters 1,462 privacy policies a year, each with an average length of 2,518 words, adding: \u201cIf one were to read each and every one of those policies, it would take seventy-six full workdays, at eight hours a day, from our lives. In the aggregate, that works out to 53.8 billion hours for all Americans, at an estimated national opportunity cost of $781 billion of lost productivity every year because of the nightmare and disgrace that are the ToS,\u201d writes the author.Can it get worse? Most people suspect some of the bigger companies are trying it on. What\u2019s the limit? \u201cGoogle too has demonstrated its penchant for ridiculous ToS. For example, anybody who uses Google Docs or happens to upload a spreadsheet, PDF, or Word document to Google Drive automatically grants ownership of the document to Google,\u201d writes the author, suggesting that if J. K. Rowling had written Harry Potter in Google Docs instead of Microsoft Word, she would have granted Google the worldwide rights to her work! That would be an expensive free service, wouldn\u2019t it? Of course, there\u2019s no suggestion that Google intends to enforce these rights and defenders suggest \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d for such language. But why not rule out in plain language such clear unintended uses?Page after page your jaw will drop. You will be shocked, amazed, saddened, depressed and confounded. You should buy this book but maybe you might start to fear buying it online. For now, at least, there are physical bookstores although even they will be tracking what you are doing\u2026There\u2019s not a lot more to say. Buy this book and devour it! You\u2019ll wish you hadn\u2019t had to but you will be better informed and rather annoyed at the end of it.Future Crimes: Everything Is Connected, Everyone Is Vulnerable and What We Can Do About It, written by Marc Goodman and published by Doubleday Books.

Having seen him speak several times at Singularity University and TED, I have always been impressed by Goodman's broad base of knowledge. I consider myself pretty well-informed about technology, and I am blown away by how the book explains how the seedier elements of society have and will use technology to do the bad stuff they do.One of the things that makes the book an engaging read is that Goodman is an excellent storyteller with a good sense of humour. Each chapter contains real-life stories that illustrate and really drive home the points he is making. The book is simultaneously informative, horrifying, and uplifting.Hearing about how technology can be and has been misused is edifying and interesting, but perhaps the best part of the book is that Goodman offers solutions, from recommended policy changes to a list of things you can do on your own computer to protect yourself from the less ethical elements of society. At the end of this book, I felt very much like I did at the end of An Inconvenient Truth: Yes, things could get bad, but we can fix it, and now I know how.Highly recommended.

Unfortunately, Goodman's speculation into future crimes often sounded like what Bruce Schneier disparagingly calls \"movie-plot crimes.\" Also the parts of the book on pedophiles and online harassment seemed out of place in a book mostly about organized cybercrime. These parts seemed to be included for fear mongering or filler. So, I would have preferred if he stuck to actual stories about hackers and cybercrime."}, {"userName": "Laurel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9217593-laurel", "userReview": "I was very confused by the documentation used in this book. At first glance it would appear that Goodman does not back up any of the facts he shares with his reader to support his theses, however there are end notes at the back of the book, that indicate sources with page numbers. There is no way to tell what he is documenting however because there are no footnotes. There are multiple notations for some of the pages. I am wondering of this is something new (perhaps to save money?) or some sort of a printing error. The fact that I could not easily locate the sources diminishes Goodman's scholarship, and the validity of his ideas. Much of what he has written is plausible, based on my own readings around \"The Dark Side\" of the internet.This is a dense book and took a while to plow through. Goodman covers every evil plot that can possibly be done via the internet. Although I assume he intends his prose to be frightening, it is so overdone that his predictions about the evil wrought by the internet become tedious. His overuse of the term \"Crime Inc.\" which references bad people that do awful things to institutions, businesses, government and individuals is so overused that I flinched every time the phrase was used. And with any book of this sort, he ends it with suggestive cures to the plight new technology has brought to our world. There is a cycle that (I believe the attribution is correct) law professor Tim Wu discusses where we are initially enamored with a new technology, and then the naysayers surface to tell us how harmful our world has become because of the technology, and then we go into a period of normalcy, where the technology and emotions around the impact become \"domesticated\" and part of everyday life. Goodman's current work about the internet feels like overkill in the warnings of impending disaster. I teach a course called \"The Dark Side of the Internet\" and would certainly consider using this book for its provocative arguments about life online."}, {"userName": "\u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0641\u0627\u0637\u0645\u0629 14", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7492611-14", "userReview": "\u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0644\u062c \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0631\u0646\u062a\u0643\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u064a\u0642\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0646\u0643 \u0644\u0633\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0628\u0648\u0646 \u064a\u0627\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632\u064a!!!\u0628\u0644 \u0623\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0639\u0629\u0630\u0643\u0631 \u0628\u0631\u0648\u0641\u0633\u0648\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0633\u0648\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639\u0629 \u064a\u0627\u0644 \u0630\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u0646 \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0645\u062c\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u064a\u0634\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0632\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0646\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0629 \"\u0645\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0645\u064a\u0646 users\" : \u0645\u0635\u0645\u0645\u0648\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0645\u062c \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0633\u0648\u0628 \u0648 \u062a\u062c\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u062f\u0631\u0627\u062a. \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0623\u0646 \u0641\u0631\u0635\u0629 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0641\u064a\u0643 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0636\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0633\u0628\u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u062a\u062c\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0629. \u0641\u0623\u0646\u062a \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0636\u063a\u0637 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0632\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0627\u0641\u0642\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0642\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0629 \u0634\u0631\u0648\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u062f\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0642\u0631\u0623\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0641\u0623\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0641\u0642 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0646\u0643 \u062a\u062a\u062d\u0645\u0644 \u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0624\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0646\u062f \u062d\u062f\u0648\u062b \u0623\u064a \u0636\u0631\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0636\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062c\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0641\u0647\u0645\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0639\u0638\u0645 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0645\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0631\u0646\u062a \u0647\u064a \u0627\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u064a\u062f\u0641\u0639\u0648\u0646 \u062b\u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0647\u0638\u0627 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0628\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u0645\u0649 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062e\u062f\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u064a\u062a\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062a\u064a\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 \u0648\u0628\u0623\u0633\u0644\u0648\u0628 \u0634\u064a\u0642 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0637\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0635\u0631 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0642\u0646\u064a\u0629. .. \u062d\u0631\u0648\u0628 \u0633\u0627\u064a\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0648 \u0639\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0635\u0646\u0629 \u0648 \u062c\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0631\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0638\u0644\u0645 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0628 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0631\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0628\u0648\u062a\u0627\u062a\u0627\u0648\u0635\u064a \u0628\u0634\u062f\u0629 \u0628\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628"}, {"userName": "Terry", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry", "userReview": "Future Crimes is a remarkable mix of boring and terrifying that I didn't think was possible.

Do you know who\u2019s looking over your shoulder as you read? I\u2019m betting you don\u2019t.Let\u2019s say you were reading this by clicking a link on Facebook. If so, Facebook would be recording that fact \u2014 and every other action you took while you were on its site.If, instead, you were to access this review on my website using Chrome, Internet Explorer, or IOS, then you\u2019d be adding to the databanks of Google, Microsoft, or Apple \u2014 and all the personal data you have stored on your computer, notebook, or smartphone would also be up for grabs.Since you\u2019re reading it on Amazon.com or Goodreads, you should know that Amazon is accumulating similar information about you and your preferences.All of the above is trueDon\u2019t believe me? You could read the Terms of Service you okayed when you installed any of those programs. Admit it, now: you didn\u2019t read that 50-page document in four-point type \u2014 and you\u2019re extremely unlikely to do so even now. The Terms of Service issued by the companies that provide the software you use (and sometimes hardware, too) permit them to learn everything there is to know about you online and to do with it what they will. The same goes for any online vendor you\u2019ve ever bought anything at all from. And what they all do is not just tailor their ads to your tastes and behavior: they sell that data to data brokers such as Axciom, Epsilon, and ReedElsevier, who in turn make it available to all comers. Including Internet thieves, terrorists, stalkers, anarchist hackers, and other miscreants. Assuming those same evil-doers haven\u2019t already obtained all your information by hacking into massive databases such as those maintained by Target or Sony or, for that matter, the federal government.Yes, you read that right: If you do practically anything online, your life is an open book to the world (unless you happen to be extremely sophisticated about cyber security). As Marc Goodman puts it in Future Crimes, \u201cThe more we plug our devices and our lives into the global information grid \u2014 whether via mobile phones, social networks, elevators, or self-driving cars \u2014 the more vulnerable we become to those who know how the underlying technologies work and how to exploit them to their advantage . . . Simply stated, when everything is connected, everyone is vulnerable.\u201d All the more so because the bad guys are usually two steps ahead of the rest of us.Now comes the Internet of ThingsAs if this isn\u2019t bad enough, just wait for the so-called Internet of Things to mature. Already, the car you drive may have as many as fifty microprocessors embedded within it. Once your home becomes a \u201csmarthome,\u201d with all lights, locks, heating, cooling, and appliances controllable through a handheld device, your life will truly become vulnerable to malware (viruses, Trojans, and worms) as well as the predations of an identity thief or some other variety of Internet crook.Already, a truly diabolical thief can acquire software that enables him to hold your computer hostage, locking you out of all your files unless you pay a ransom running to hundreds or even thousands of dollars. (Bitcoin is the preferred mode of payment.) And even if that thief can be identified by name and address, he\u2019s probably working in plain sight in St. Petersburg or Kiev and completely out of reach of law enforcement.So, you think your antivirus program will keep the predators at bay? As Goodman writes, \u201cthe antivirus software you are running on your own computer is likely only catching 5 percent of the emerging threats targeting your machine.\u201d Yes, five percent. Moreover, a cyber attack is typically detected not in minutes or hours, when something might be done about it, but in months or even years.It turns out that the Internet is a far more complex and dangerous environment than you\u2019re likely to know. Certainly, I wasn\u2019t aware that Google has indexed only 16 terabytes of the data that comprises the Internet, while 7,500 terabytes are hidden from view. A German research institute determined \u201cthat there were forty-nine million strains of computer malware in the wild. By 2011, the antivirus company McAfee reported it was identifying two million new pieces of malware every month.\u201d Yes, every month. And McAfee\u2019s estimate is a conservative one.Much bigger threatsIf only our personal electronic devices alone were at risk! Consider the US electric grid, \u201coften called the most complex machine in the world.\u201d Goodman cites a report by the US Department of Energy revealing that the grid \u201cconnects fifty-eight hundred individual power plants and has more than 450,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines. Yet 70 percent of the grid\u2019s key components are more than twenty-five years old. Each of these components used much older . . . technologies that are readily attackable and persistently targeted.\u201d In fact, Goodman goes on to report that one utility \u201chad been the target of more than 10,000 attempted cyber attacks each month.\u201dCan you think of a more effective way to shut down American civilization than taking out our electric grid?Do you think the Pentagon could prevent this? Think again. Chinese hackers working for their government have already acquired all the data associated with the \u201c$300 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter,\u201d and that\u2019s just the most expensive weapons system. They\u2019ve also pilfered the plans for our missile defense system, our most advanced helicopters, and numerous others. \u201cAccording to an FBI report,\u201d Goodman writes, \u201cChina has secretly developed an army of 180,000 cyber spies and warriors, mounting an incredible ninety thousand computer attacks a year against the U.S. Defense Department networks alone.\u201d And many of those attacks aren\u2019t detected until years later.You ain\u2019t seen nothing yetAs anyone who is intimately familiar with the progress of scientific research and development, not just in the US but around the world, Artificial Intelligence, robotics, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and other contemporary fields of inquiry are on the verge of creating enormous new opportunities for good \u2014 and terrifying potential for harm.Much of Future Crimes is devoted to the vulnerability of the electronic devices we use today. That\u2019s Part One. In Part Two, Goodman justifies the book\u2019s title by exploring \u201cThe Future of Crime.\u201d Read this, and I guarantee that you will be shocked by many of the examples Goodman cites that point to the dangers inherent in the new technologies now on the drawing board.In Part Three, \u201cSurviving Progress,\u201d Goodman advances a number of recommendations about how to fight back against the hackers and Internet criminals who bedevil us today \u2014 and ameliorate or prevent the damage that future technologies might wreak on ourselves and our society. Some of these recommendations are bold, imaginative, and realistic. Future Crimes should be read by every government policymaker and every concerned citizen."}, {"userName": "Haydngoseek", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58411296-haydngoseek", "userReview": "tl;dr - long, fairly well-researched.

More importantly, Goodman talks not just about cyber-as-vector, which most people think about, but cyber-as-space, and how THE CYBERS provide an environment for bad actors to conduct business far more efficiently and at greater scale than before the dawn of THE INTERWEBS - the same as with normal businesses.The overview of bio, AI, nano, and space seems thrown in because Goodman thought they were cool, but on the other hand everything was well-researched. Goodman tries to close out with a handful of policy recommendations - this is a nice note to end on. Unfortunately, it's also sadly naive, because it's much less researched and meticulously charted out than the rest of the book. A lot of it was old hat to me, but would have been much more interesting to a general audience.If you don't know much about any of the subjects of the book, and just want to read one book on emerging technology's downsides, definitely check this out. People working in the INTERWEBS and CYBERS industry might also enjoy it, but know what you're getting into."}, {"userName": "Steven Shelton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19801338-steven-shelton", "userReview": "A combination of eye opening, horrifying, and obnoxious. Very pessimistic in tone throughout. He makes it obvious that we desperately need to update laws and security practices regarding the use and management of technology in our lives, while simultaneously setting a new world record for the use of the word concomitant in a single text. If you want to avoid having someone try to scare you into action and just get to the punchline, the recommendations can be found in the last two chapters and the appendix."}, {"userName": "Andreas Ragen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39528312-andreas-ragen", "userReview": "As a professional techie, there was nothing new for me here, but it gave me a different point of view and shifted some paradigms. I can certainly agree that the conclusions drawn are by no means far fetched, rather fully within the realm of possibility and in many cases already in use.I also believe that it is of utmost importance for people to read this book and similar materials, in order to learn how to safely live in this age."}], "description": "One of the world\u2019s leading authorities on global security, Marc Goodman takes readers deep into the digital underground to expose the alarming ways criminals, corporations, and even countries are using new and emerging technologies against you\u2014and how this makes everyone more vulnerable than ever imagined.\u00a0 Technological advances have benefited our world in immeasurable ways, but there is an ominous flip side: our technology can be turned against us. Hackers can activate baby monitors to spy on families, thieves are analyzing social media posts to plot home invasions, and stalkers are exploiting the GPS on smart phones to track their victims\u2019 every move. We all know today\u2019s criminals can steal identities, drain online bank accounts, and wipe out computer servers, but that\u2019s just the beginning. To date, no computer has been created that could not be hacked\u2014a sobering fact given our radical dependence on these machines for everything from our nation\u2019s power grid to air traffic control to financial services.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yet, as ubiquitous as technology seems today, just over the horizon is a tidal wave of scientific progress that will leave our heads spinning. If today\u2019s Internet is the size of a golf ball, tomorrow\u2019s will be the size of the sun. Welcome to the Internet of Things, a living, breathing, global information grid where every physical object will be online. But with greater connections come greater risks. Implantable medical devices such as pacemakers can be hacked to deliver a lethal jolt of electricity and a car\u2019s brakes can be disabled at high speed from miles away. Meanwhile, 3-D printers can produce AK-47s, bioterrorists can download the recipe for Spanish flu, and cartels are using fleets of drones to ferry drugs across borders.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With explosive insights based upon a career in law enforcement and counterterrorism, Marc Goodman takes readers on a vivid journey through the darkest recesses of the Internet. Reading like science fiction, but based in science fact, Future Crimes explores how bad actors are primed to hijack the technologies of tomorrow, including robotics, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. These fields hold the power to create a world of unprecedented abundance and prosperity. But the technological bedrock upon which we are building our common future is deeply unstable and, like a house of cards, can come crashing down at any moment.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Future Crimes provides a mind-blowing glimpse into the dark side of technological innovation and the unintended consequences of our connected world. Goodman offers a way out with clear steps we must take to survive the progress unfolding before us. Provocative, thrilling, and ultimately empowering, Future Crimes will serve as an urgent call to action that shows how we can take back control over our own devices and harness technology\u2019s tremendous power for the betterment of humanity\u2014before it\u2019s too late.From the Hardcover edition.", "title": "Future Crimes: Everything Is Connected, Everyone Is Vulnerable and What We Can Do About It", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "average": 3.94, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1526996791l/40192801.jpg", "reviews": 434, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7456960.Marc_Goodman", "name": "Marc Goodman"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Science", "Business", "Science"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40367446-cybercrime-en-cyberwar", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40194940-the-open-door", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37781642-les-crimes-technologiques", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26862070-lightspeed-magazine-october-2015", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19057285-the-national-interest"]}
