Now, imagine that for every 10 minutes you jog through this sludge, you're allowed 8 seconds to run at a pace of a 4-minute mile, before having your feet once again encased in cement bricks. You now have some semblance of my excruciating experience reading this dreadful, heinous, poorly-written dribble.The author needs to take a lesson on reigning in the exposition; we get it, the main character's life is terribly boring. Stop assuming your audience is comprised of dim-witted imbeciles who can't grasp the doldrums of the protagonist's mediocre job, and obnoxious family after 30 pages. Oh, wait, let's quickly punctuate the story's misery with a quick and brutal killing, and then go immediately back into 30 more pages of boring, repetitive vomit.Spare yourself the agony of reading this and just jam a rusted fork into your eye socket."}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg", "userReview": "I don't want to say anything about this book because it will probably give away something if I do.

Okay, it changed the world immensely if not completely. So I wonder if self published writers like David Moody would have otherwise achieved such recognition in such a comparatively short time if not for the exposure gained through the internet. Maybe he might have eventually got his books published or maybe he might have been just another author destined for oblivion and failure. While latter is not the case with him (and I am glad for that), but if you are going to read Moody for the first time and that book happens to be much sensationalized and soon to be a major motion picture, Hater, you might think that that might exactly be the case. At least I thought that way.Hater starts off with the first attack of the \"Hater\" itself and then introduces us to the protagonist Danny McCoyne who is stuck in a dead end job which pays peanuts (also the boss is very annoying) while his story on the family front is more or less the same. A shitty apartment in an unnamed town in a backward neighborhood. A bickering wife (Liz) and three very annoying children. A father-in-law who openly despises him.So, what is the rest of the story, you ask? That's it. The above paragraph just repeats itself again and again until you hate the book itself and then after more than halfway through, the story advances somewhat. But I felt that it was too late to salvage the plot.The most annoying thing is, the ambiguity of the plot is not cleared even at the end. I guess you have to read the rest of the series for that.When I heard that Guillermo del Toro was going to produce a motion picture based on this book, I knew I was going to read it before the movie came out. You see, Pan's Labyrinth is one of my favorite movies, so that stirred my interest for reading this work. Guillermo del Toro still might make an awesome movie out of this, but I won't recommend reading Hater if it is your first David Moody book. This was my first encounter with his work, but in retrospect I think I should have started reading David Moody with Autumn instead of this.Who knows, things might have worked out differently."}, {"userName": "Misty", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1124284-misty", "userReview": "4.5It's difficult for me to explain this book without giving away something vital.

Call me a Hater, but I hated it.Okay, so it's supposed to be a creative retelling of the old zombie story, right? By the way, SPOILER ALERT...don't read any more if you don't want to read spoilers...So imagine a zombie story told from the point of view of one of the zombies. Hmm. That could be interesting, kind of like classic fairy tales told from an alternate POV. That idea has promise. But here's my problem with Hater. I don't like the main character. I never like him. Before he changes, or after he changes. He's repugnant. I understand the concept of an anti-hero, but even anti-heroes have something likable about them. Danny has a crappy job and he feels burdened and worn out by family life. And because it's told from his POV, we get the message loud and clear how much he hates his life, hates his father-in-law, hates his boss, hates his kids, hates hates hates hates hates. And then he becomes a Hater. He changes for some unknown reason and becomes a killing machine. Kill the non-haters before they get you, even if that includes your own family. Am I supposed to like him more now? It's basically gore-porn. I don't mind violence in movies or books, but the violence in this book seems to exist for no more of a deeper reason than because the author thinks it's cool. And apparently others do too. (Guillermo del Toro bought the film rights? Really?) Del Toro says on the jacket that it's a cautionary tale. Hmm. About 30 percent of the population changes into killing machines who kill for reasons of self-manifested self-preservation. They become paranoid psychotics, intent on wiping out the others that are different from them. I don't need a cautionary tale for man's ability to do this. I already have a big one. It was called World War II. But okay, I'll cut Del Toro some slack. He bought the film rights. He's trying to sell books. Whatever.The concept I'm still cool with. Telling the zombie story from the zombie POV. And making the \"zombie-ness\" to be a mysterious transformation where you feel like you have to kill others to protect yourself, because you feel that they'll kill you (even though, except for the soldiers, the non-Haters don't generally make the first move or provoke the violence)...okay, that could be interesting.But...Maybe it's because I'm a devoted family man. Any time Danny told his kids to shut up, or bemoaned how much they bugged him, or how much his wife nagged him, or how annoying his father-in-law was, I lost more and more empathy for this guy. He was a complainer. A weakling. He's bad with relationships, to say the least. If I'm asked to identify with this guy (and by point of him being the main character, I am tacitly asked to identify with this guy) there's got to be something I can relate to. Yes, he felt a little bit of warmth towards his youngest child. The scene where they fell asleep together was sweet. But too soon, it turns into zombie love, where he yearns for his daughter because she too has changed into a killing machine. So much for any chance of identification with this dolt.I'm sorry, Mr. Moody, but you've written a nasty little book, and not even that well (hasn't anyone ever told you that overuse of adverbs makes for weak writing? And I nearly threw up in my mouth when I read the line \"This is what I was born to do.\" You've got to be kidding me.) I don't care about Danny, so I don't care about his plight or the war that the ending so dramatically sets up for the sequels (I'd rather drink a glass-shard smoothie than read a sequel to this book)."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613919-jason", "userReview": "4.5 StarsThis was my second read of Hater.

I enjoyed it and felt a great deal of remorse for Danny and the life that he was forced to have to struggle through day after day. I felt that David Moody did a superb job of creating a cavalcade of characters that were realistically ordinary and relatable. The book moves along at a very fast pace and contains many thrilling sequences throughout. The novel is essentially a character study of Danny and his gradually declining lifestyle. The only negative about the book is the minuscule amount of explanation given as to the origin of the \"hater\" population. Hopefully the other novels will explain this phenomenon more in depth. Overall, Hater is a relentless, fast paced, and enjoyable read"}, {"userName": "Shanon", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1795513-shanon", "userReview": "It\u2019s US versus THEM with no idea whose side you\u2019re one until it\u2019s too late! What a twisted world. I was completely captivated by this story. It felt very similar to a zombie book without the walking undead if that makes any sense\u2026 No? Well if you read it (and I suggest you do) then it will. :) We follow one man, Danny, who is discontented with his job, his family situation and life in general. There were times at the beginning of the novel when he was frustrated with kids pulling him every which direction but sane that I felt for him, I really did. But in all honesty Danny\u2019s life wasn\u2019t all that bad and I found myself feeling frustrated with him for being so disgruntled. Panic spreads throughout his town when random people begin brutally killing for no apparent reason. Eventually these people are given the name \u2018Haters\u2019 and they are growing in number. Danny and his family are forced to stay in, locking themselves in their home and venturing out only for necessities. The explanation for the \u2018Haters\u2019 left me disappointed. I wanted more. It felt like this aspect of the story wasn\u2019t nearly developed enough. Had there been more attention placed on the reason it could\u2019ve been a truly terrifying tale.

In my opinion, and obviously many people disagree with me, this is not a zombie book. I kind of want to yell this but I figure capital letters would be inappropriate. Caps might hint that I care more for this book than I do.The writing is mediocre, the characters flat, boring, and whiny. I initially sympathized with the main character but after hearing him tell his children to shut up for the millionth time, I lost any remaining interest. I finished this book so I can justify my bad rating. Biggest complaint...the plot is nothing new and a major rip off of the movie 28 Days Later. The book is shy of 300 pages and hardly anything happens in the first 100. The writing is overly simplistic.

I don't even know if I'll be finishing this one. :P4/16: I actually finished it.

This was an unexpected turn of events! I spent the first two thirds of this book in admiration of the way Moody portrays an average working class guy, with all the pressures of daily working and family life, but still a little irritated with the character himself. While it is a novel experience to see an apocalyptic event through the eyes of an average person, who hasn't put all the pieces together, (he barely gets time to watch the news), and with no fortuitous circumstances that put him at the centre of the action..... it can also be a little frustrating. Particularly when that character carries with them a certain level of ignorance and prejudice. Then it dawned on me - Perhaps there is a reason for all of this, and now that I think of it, there is a way in which this could be turned into something really important and meaningful..... That's exactly what Moody did of course, and with a great sense of style, intelligence and symmetry too. It's a beautifully written book from start to finish. There were certain scenes that really gave me the feeling of being there, and a sense of shared anxiety with the central character. By the end of the book, I was stumbling over myself to read ahead and find out what happens next.I did really struggle to give this one a rating, only because it came so close to being a perfect book in my eyes. I felt that Moody could very easily have wrapped it up into a very neat and well balanced self-contained story, but right at the end it veered off into trilogy territory. In my view, the story would have been absolutely perfect if it had been rounded off and left with a clear message.

This one hit on all cylinders for me. I just finished it and I started it the other day, but I finished reading it the second sitting! I have read a little of the author's zombie books, called Autumn I believe. What you have here is an epidemic of Hate. Normal people begin to turn into murderous killers, taking other's lives for no reason other than the fell they need to. After they do it it seems they are afraid and don't understand why they did it. As more and more people turn they tend to gather together and the remorse is replaced by solidarity. The government steps in and finally they bring arms to bear against these maniacs, whom the media has dubbed Haters. This story is about Danny McCoyne and his wife and kids, an irritating Father In Law and the events that unfold around their world. This takes place in the UK and it is a straight up page turner! The descent into madness that happens around this seemingly normal family is chaotic and strange, and the author gives the feelings and situations that happen around this family life and meaning, fear and confusion. The reader is dragged along through this whirlwind of unknowable events until Danny himself is affected and the partial truth of what is going on appears like a shotgun blast!This was so good.

I am a huge zombie fan and even though this book is not about zombies it\u2019s closely related, in a 28 Days Later-esk theme. \tThe story starts when the \u2018Hero\u2019 sees a gentleman start attacking a little old lady on the street, seeming to try and kill her.

It takes a lot to get me to give up on a book because I believe that every page you turn might make the book worth while. This book did not have that effect on me. It was a definite struggle to get through it. As I understand it this is only the first book of a series, I can say quite honestly that I am not even slightly tempted to read the others in the series. If you pick this book up, good luck to you.

Looks like we are in for one helluva ride!\".David Moody, author of the novel Hater, paints a grim and twisted picture of \"us\" against \"them\", a world where people have to learn to live in fear of being suddenly and violently attacked by strangers, coworkers, and loved ones. It can happen almost without warning. And no one knows for sure why it's happening. Or how to stop it.Imagine walking to work, and finding yourself a witness to a seemingly unprovoked street fight. You watch in awe as one person beats the other unconscious. And continues to beat him. You are one of many within the crowd, yet no one moves a muscle to come to the others defense.Later that week, you and your spouse and children are eating dinner out at a restaurant. Before you can clean your plate, you watch in horror as two people at the bar suddenly engage in a violent fight that ends when one man brutally stabs the other with a steak knife. Everyone is paralyzed with fear, not sure what is going on, and urgently heads for the front doors.When you get home, you turn on the television to see news reporters covering multiple acts of violence that have been occurring around town. They seem unrelated, though they sound so much the same - random, sudden, brutal, unexplainable. The body count is climbing.You think that the news is playing a part in all of this - sensationalizing the murders, encouraging others to go out and instigate more of the same with little to no consequence.A few more days pass... you can't seem to head outside without watching people attacking each other. They seem to turn on a dime. One minute they are walking by you, or having a normal conversation with each other, and then there's this blank stare and then BAM - you are fighting for your life as they thrash and slash and smash you. Now the news reporters request you do not leave the house unless absolutely necessary. They suggest creating a \"safe room\" for you own protection. They warn you to be wary of people who display any signs of anger or aggression. They say they have it under control. Yet no one is saying what exactly is happening. Stores and cars are being looted. It's not safe to go outside... but DON'T PANIC?!?Written in first person narrative, David Moody sucks the reader right into the middle of the confusion and chaos that is taking place. We know only what our narrator Danny knows, which, for most of the novel, is not much. Unable to process what is going on, Danny and his family move through myriad emotions as the violence and brutality increases, and moves closer and closer to his front door.What I find most amazing about this novel is the fact that it's author self-published it online back on 2006, and sold it's film rights to Gueillermo del Toro, all without the help of an agent! How could any publishing company have turned this away?Packing punch after punch, chapter after chapter, Moody kept me turning the pages faster and faster, and I found myself on the edge of the seat time and time again.You've seen vampires, zombies, and nuclear bombs that helped issue in the end the world as we all knew it. Now it's time to meet the Haters!A brilliant kick-off novel to a trilogy that screams to be read by lovers of post apocalyptic novels with a strong stomach and a head for thrillers.Go ahead, get your Hate on!

And I have to thank my classmates for telling me to read this book.Humanity has in front of it a new threat: the human itself. But not usual humans, but humans that has changed from the nice and familiar people we know into \"haters\" that kill with cold blood the person next to them. While the crimes are becoming more and more frequent, Danny McCoyne tries his best to keep his family alive.Hater is the kind of fast-paced book, made to be devoured by a relatively large public, in spite of the cruel subjects you find in it. And the book was a real surprise for me and I liked it quite a lot. Because it was not predictable (at least not for me) and because it shows society in it's absolute crisis, where even the sole survival of the human race is at stake. I think it is even terrifying (and I am not the kind of person who gets easily impressed) exactly because of how real it feels, I can see everything happening exactly how it was described in this book.It's not the kind of book that will change your life and maybe any other time I wouldn't have enjoyed it so much. I read books that were much better than this one, but also books that were much worse. What makes Hater special though, it is the fact that as a final product, this book is satisfying. It gives the reader a little bit of everything. You have different types of love, action and moments that will catch your breath and you also have peaceful, familiar scenes of a normal life. I, especially, needed this kind of book: that doesn't ask too much of you, that presents in it's own rhythm how things are going; you don't need to always be thinking a step ahead, maybe-maybe you'll guess what's happening. I needed a relaxing and refreshing book, in simply the way it is written. And if anyone feels like reading something out of what they're usually reading, something new to break the chain of similar books, I totally recommend this one.Danny is such a nice character! He's human, so so human, and as a reader, you fully emphasize with what he's feeling and living. You would also swear, be terified or sick to your stomach, you would also want more and you would also feel the same type of despair. He's charming thanks to his normality, thanks to the fact that each of us has a little bit of Dannny and Danny has a little bit of each of us. And I'm talking so much about this particular character because he's also the narrator of the most part of the story, so you're following all his actions. But the other characters were just as charming and normal, just as any of us or the people around us.But, the bad part of this book: it didn't manage to make me feel everything as vividly as I was expecting from this kind of reading experience. I would have liked the despair and the horror to be better described, to feel the fear and the panic in my own bones.But it's intense and I appreciate the crimes and how they were done. I like murders with style, and this book has a lot of this. It also ends in a very interesting cliffhanger and I am so curious to see what's happening from now onwards! This book was really such a pleasent surprise!"}, {"userName": "Maciek", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2969647-maciek", "userReview": "I remember reading a comic strip where a man was watching the news. Almost all of them consisted of catastrophes, terrorist attacks, murders, thievery and corruption. While the newscaster was relaying all these horrible things, mad preachers in the background ranted about the end of the world. Maybe this is the end of the world? - the guy though, standing up from his chair. The strip ended with a drawing of him opening his closet door and taking out an axe.I finished Hater yesterday night (well, technically it was today) and thought it was surprisingly, um, enjoyable. I found it surprisingly fast-paced and thought provoking. What if we all would just start killing each other? How to deal with it? The answer the author suggests is brutally honest and scary - we hit back. It's not US agains THEM - there are no sides. We are at war with ourselves, and the only outcome possible is human exctinction, because stick and stones can break our bones.There is no plague; there are no zombies. There are only emotions - hate and fear. How thin is the line between them? In fear, what separates the sane from the crazy?Plus, Hater has a scene that will make every man cringe. Uhhh. I still feel uncomfortable.Hater is a genuinely intriguing piece of speculative fiction. I've read that a movie adaptation is in the works; it certainly has the potential to be one badass film. Meanwhile, I can safely recommend this novel: It's disturbing, suspenseful and utterly enjoyable despite taking place in a world full of fear, mistrust and madness. It's good it's fiction. At least for now."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2248042-amanda", "userReview": "Great concept, much more original than i thought it was gonna be.  Man, the lead character was such a miserable ass imo though. I don't understand how people can be that miserable in their life and not change. After 12 years i am still excited to see my man every night. In the morning even if i'm pissed at him for something i always kiss him goodbye and tell him i love him. I always have this nagging thought that what if it could be the last time i see him (god forbid) and i acted like an asshole because of some triviality. That seems to always bring things into perspective for me. Anyway, to get back to the book... The protagonist was just such a whiner- i mean i've never been lucky enough to have a job that i DIDN'T hate. (that's why i'm in school, to hopefully change that) Even though i didn't like the unappreciative bastard that was the main character, the book had me hooked from the start. I don't think the author really wanted us to like the protagonist though. God, I hope that was the intention anyway. The fact that this author got to the point he's at by promoting himself is extraordinary! Way to make ur dreams happen! I hope that the sequel comes out soon. I didn't really mind this novel ending like it did i felt he concluded that part of the story satisfactorily, yet left us a reason to want to pick up the next book. Can't wait to see the movie!"}, {"userName": "Alondra", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6130276-alondra", "userReview": "4 StarsI know, I know. This is not literature. It didn't make me want to change my life and do worldly things...but I could not put it down.This book reminded me a little, of The Cell by Stephen King, and 28 Days Later. Both of which, tackle extreme violence caused by signals, experimentation gone bad, etc. etc. I really enjoyed, liked, inhaled this book... the telling of a story, and all you want to know is, why? Why? Why did this happen? Who made this happen? When did it start happening? Why, Why, Why?...actually, I don't know what the hell is wrong with me and I don't know the answer to why?.... I read this book in 1 day, and got pissed off by the losers that kept interrupting me while I was reading it. They made me so angry.

Prior to Danny all the Haters started their killing spree because they were terrified (though in some cases it's been a bit ambiguous). But Danny is never portrayed as being in fear for his life. He's afraid for his daughter Ellie's life, but not his own. Instead, Danny is almost clinically dispassionate about things. He believes it's us or them, but he sees it as a simple fact. It makes him a little sad with regard to the rest of his family, but otherwise he doesn't feel afraid or angry about the people he's about to kill. At the end he's anticipating it and killing makes him feel satisfied. It's the normal people who feel fear and possibly hatred as their friends and loved ones suddenly become dangerously irrational.It's Danny's cold assessment that's the most chilling. Again, he seems dispassionate about the people he's going to kill. He has to kill them before they kill him. (Of course, if he didn't kill them they wouldn't kill him, but that's never thought about). I'm assuming this was some government super soldier project that got out of hand. He's certainly acting like a super soldier. Ready, even eager to kill with no fear and no remorse. Suddenly faster and stronger and deadly. I'd still like to know how it's spread.It's kind of scary how quickly the government was able to put together a death camp.

As a series of seemingly random attacks take place in the city where he lives and works, he takes the step of barricading his family in their flat for their safety, only venturing out reluctantly in search of supplies.The tension builds slowly, and the first half of the book is full of flash scenes of the virus attacking at random, which I love in any apocalyptic book and in Hater it's pretty confronting - school girls, policemen, the elderly - no one is immune to the random impact of the virus. The Haters themselves are initially uncontrollable, but after the initial outburst become more subdued and cannot be easily distinguished from other non-infected people.I really liked that Hater is about an average guy - he's certainly no hero, and as the story progresses, his family become increasingly paranoid even of each other - snapped words and sharp looks caused by living in such a stressful environment begin to push them closer to turning on each other.Hater is an addictive read and certainly has the one-more-chapter feel, right up until the twist and climax which went in a direction that I certainly wasn't expecting. It's fabulously unpredictable and I'd love to tell you more about it, but it's difficult without giving important parts of the story away.My only reason for not giving it a full five star rating is that the characters can be a little unlikable and there are a few periods of what I can only call repetitive whinging. But otherwise Hater is an intense and extremely tense read, and David Moody holds absolutely nothing back.Read more of my reviews at The Aussie Zombie"}, {"userName": "Tressa ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/226335-tressa", "userReview": "I am somewhat disappointed in this book. It plods along until the last few chapters, describing in every chapter what a crappy life the protagonist has--he has a nagging, bitchy wife and three annoying children; a crummy, low-paying job; a dumpy tenement apartment; and a father-in-law who thinks he's not good enough for his daughter--and the different ways citizens are being turned on by strangers and even loved ones.The premise is a good one--what would happen to society if people on impulse started murdering each other?--and the sense of growing paranoia and the breakdown of our ordered world is done well, but I really don't \"get\" it. Do the Haters have a legitimate gripe and reason for turning on non-Haters? I really didn't understand the kill-or-be-killed explanation. The strangers, friends, and family members the Haters brutally murdered were not out to get them in the first place. I kept expecting there to be a good reason for the turning, like maybe the non-Haters were some alien breed or something as wacky. When that or something as strange didn't happen, I was letdown to say the least. Hell, the non-Haters were surprised when they were brutally set upon and murdered! There is no \"war\" between the two groups because the other side doesn't even fight back. The \"next step in evolution\" just rings false to me. A world of murdering Haters ruling over...what? Would they turn on each other and bash themselves out of existence?Hater would have been better as a short story or novella. There's just not enough meat here for an entire book. Odd for me to say that since it's going to be a series. I don't think I'll be reading the sequels."}, {"userName": "Greg at 2 Book Lovers Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26135818-greg-at-2-book-lovers-reviews", "userReview": "I don\u2019t usually read a book more than once, but when I was planning my month of horror I knew that Hater had to be involved. Hater redefines the whole post-apocalyptic genre and turns it into, \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the world as we know it.\u201dWhat is great about Hater is the normalcy of everything. Danny McCoyne is not your typical PA hero, he is a normal family man, just trying to get by. He has a crappy job, three disgruntled kids, an exhausted wife, and a father-in-law who loves to rub in his superiority. In most PA books, Danny wouldn\u2019t ever be worth mentioning. But David Moody creates a fantastic story around this most unlikely protagonist; it works because any of us could be Danny McCoyne.The true genius of Hater comes from the origin of the apocalypse. It\u2019s a \u201czombiesque\u201d book, without the zombies. There is absolutely no way to know who is safe and who is not. With zombies, you can see them shuffle towards you, and as long as you keep making head shots, you\u2019re good to go. In Hater there is no way to know who will change or when, there is no way to protect yourself from the danger.Hater is the end of the world as you have never seen it before. It is dark and it fills you with hopelessness. I can imagine John Cleese telling me to remain calm, everything is under control, as soldiers carry my neighbor from their home, hoping that they are getting the right people. David Moody is definitely a glass half empty kind of writer."}, {"userName": "Dreadlocksmile", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2075479-dreadlocksmile", "userReview": "From the author of the classic post-apocalyptic zombie series 'Autumn', David Moody's new ultra-violent novel 'Hater' is a masterpiece of dark and bloodthirsty fiction. From the very first page the reader is thrown into a downward spiral of seemingly unprovoked and extreme violence. As civilisation is slowly torn apart from the inside, fear and confusion take over. David throws up a cloud of unnerving mystery as the reader is taken along by this unrelenting wave of violence. The novel homes in on the emotional strain and fear of everyone in the book, drawing you deep into the gripping text. With each chapter, tension builds towards a massive climax that will leave you gasping. Possibly the most original and thought provoking take on this type of genre, David will keep you guessing throughout. `Hater' is in my opinion David's most shocking and powerful novel to date. The novel ends ready to be taken up by the sequel `Dog Blood' which I am already eagerly anticipating. With a general premise to the storyline that's not too dissimilar to James Herbert's novel 'The Fog', Jim Stalin & Daina Graziunas's novel 'Among Madmen' or indeed Danny Boyle's film '28 Days Later...', if you're a fan of any post-apocalyptic fiction, then this uber-violent yet thought provoking approach to the genre will satisfy the morbid thirst of any follower of similar fiction.

Christened \u201cHaters\u201d by the media, the attackers strike without warning and seemingly without reason. Within seconds, normally rational, self-controlled people become frenzied, vicious killers. As the carnage mounts, one thing soon is clear: everyone, irrespective of race, gender, age, or class, has the potential to become either a Hater or a victim. At any moment, even friends and family can turn on one another with violent intent. In the face of this mindless terror, all McCoyne can do is secure his family, seek shelter, and watch as the world falls apart. But when he bolts the front door, the question remains: Is he shutting the danger out or locking it in?\u00a9 2009 Blackstone Audio", "title": "Hater\n      \n          (Hater #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6583306-hater", "average": 3.65, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328325197l/6583306.jpg", "reviews": 817, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/117582.David_Moody", "name": "David Moody"}], "type": ["Horror", "Horror", "Fiction", "Science Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6583306-hater", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/263460.Hater", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5989615-hater", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6739080-hater", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6444093-hater", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35221806-odio", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8103876-autumn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7171452-dog-blood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8723188-the-city", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9219992-them-or-us", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9998730-purification"]}
