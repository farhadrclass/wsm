He's hilarious, and if you haven't seen him perform you're missing out. Which makes me wish I'd listened to this as an audiobook...Turns out, Aziz and his partner, Eric Klinenberg, did quite a bit of research for this book. Now, is it the best book out there on this subject? The most detailed investigation with the most clinical data?Probably not.But there was waaay more research-y stuff in here than I was expecting from a book written by a stand-up comedian & actor. Between the two of them, they did focus groups, had pie charts, and looked at how people dated in a few different cultures. Not a ton, but a few!Japan (Tokyo, in particular) was interesting! I'd heard about their lack of interest in sex, but I didn't realize it was now such a big deal that the government was stepping in to help out. You'd think Tokyo would be a hopping place for singles, but evidently...not so much.Even so, it sounds like a fabulous place to visit! They looked at Paris to see what a more laid-back culture thought about monogamy, and the results were...less surprising. More Parisians were cool with (a bit of) cheating than other countries.That's Hot!Sorry, wrong Paris.They also looked at Buenos Aries, which is (supposedly) a more aggressive city for dating. As in, the guys are aggressive and take catcalling to a whole new level. Or maybe it's a game both genders play in that culture?Either way, catcalling is gross, disrespectful, and not the way to meet your soul mate. <--just my opinion.Now, if you've ever seen Ansari's stand-up, you've probably seen him get someone out of the audience and scroll through their texts. This is like Aziz scrolling through thousands of personal texts to see what people are saying to each other. What's dating like for singles when there are so many ways to communicate? When everything is instantaneous? When you can swipe a face to connect, or send out mass generic messages on a dating site?How do you connect without being a needy dork or a creeper? What is the correct etiquette?Can you break up via text? Or ask someone to the prom in an IM?Are those, in fact, preferred methods of communications?!Oh my God, I'm so old!Is love in the digital age easier or harder? Are singles making rookie mistakes that knock them out of them out of the game, or is the game itself a tad more full of potential landmines than it was when I was single?I'm looking at you, dick pics!As Aziz points out, these stupid blunders just couldn't have happened 20 years ago.The point he makes is that the landscape for dating has changed...again. And I'm sure it will continue to morph and alter into something unrecognizable in another 20 years. That's not necessarily a bad thing, at all. In fact, there are upsides (searching for someone you connect with on a deep level, instead of settling) and downsides (expecting too much from one person, and not being satisfied) when it comes to Modern Romance.Admittedly, I had no real reason to want to read a book about dating. I'm not looking for love because I already had my very Unmodern Romance.We met at work, and talked on landline phones for hours!I simply wanted to take a peek at how the other half lives. And it was pretty enlightening! No, I don't feel sorry for the singles out there today. I don't think it's any harder, but it's definitely different for them than it was for me. Every era has its own pitfalls, but in the end, I think we all want the same thing."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/3.5 Stars\nModern Romance went on my TBR as soon as I heard rumors of its existence. We\u2019re talking about waiting months for this damn thing (and also never being able to track down an ARC) . . . \nQuick confession \u2013 I never bothered reading the synopsis for this book. I saw Aziz Ansari had a \u201cromance\u201d book coming out and my brain immediately thought it would be something like \u201cTom Haverford\u2019s Guide to Dating\u201d . . . \nIf I would have bothered reading the blurb, I would have realized that:\n\u201cAnsari combines his irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science to give us an unforgettable tour of our new romantic world.\u201d\nThis book was seriously science-y. And not in a bad way either. It was an exploration of how finding a match has morphed from the 1950s to the present \u2013 but with an Ansari twist that brought the LOLz:\n\u201cAron published another study, title \u201cCouples\u2019 Shared Participation in Novel and Arousing Activities and Experienced Relationship Quality\u201d (damn, dude, shorten the names or your studies!)\u201d\nModern Romance begins with Ansari admitting that he\u2019s totally a girl. (HA! Just kidding. Bet that got some of you who have accused Mitchell and I of being women haters here on Goodreads all worked up.) Seriously though, Ansari\u2019s introduction includes him picturing his future with a woman he made out with one night, questioning whether a text message came off too desperate or needy, wondering whether the lack of response to said text message is because of him or because some horrible accident befell his potential soulmate, etc. Basically, he proves in three pages that chicks and dudes are TOTALLY THE SAME when it comes to modern day relationships. Then there was a brief trip on the waybackmachine a l\u00e1 When Harry Met Sally which included interviews of nursing home residents regarding how/when/where they met their spouse (there was also a lot of talk about how delicious donuts are in this segment. Mmmmmmm, donuts). I confirmed that I could easily be transplanted to the 1950s since I got married when I was a fetus instead of waiting until I was pushing 30 like modern-day women tend to do. *shrug*The book then fast-forwards through the ages to today and the land of terrifying technology . . . \nIt covered everything from the mind games of not immediately responding to text messages in order to not appear desperate, to how modern romance works in countries other than \u2018Murica, to online dating (I\u2019m telling you, if it gets any easier than Tinder y\u2019all single folks might as well just buy sex robots and save yourself the time and effort of leaving the house), to cyberstalking snooping on your significant other . . . \nand reminded readers that you might not always get a boner every time you touch your beloved\u2019s hair, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re \u201csettling.\u201dIf you\u2019re looking for a laugh a second book of Ansari\u2019s hits and misses when it comes to the romance game, this probably isn\u2019t the choice for you. However, if you\u2019re interested in a sociological study of how dating has evolved over time with some humor added in to the mix, this one\u2019s a winner. And really \u2013 who can pass up getting to know a little more about Aziz Ansari\u2019s outlook on love . . . \nNote: I am still holding out hope that Aziz will write a straight-up hilarious autobiography . . .  \n^^^crosses fingers^^^^"}, {"userName": "Nandakishore Varma", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma", "userReview": "I got married in 1989. In India in those days, \"love\" marriages were still exceptions rather than the norm: when you had to look at the religion, caste, family background, and age of a possible partner who was to share your life (divorces were absolute stigma!) before hitching up, falling in love was like solving a mathematical equation with too many constraints. For a nerdy, uncouth, shy and bookish youngster who got tongue-tied in presence of a halfway-pretty girl, this was even more of a nightmare.Fortunately, as an educated young man from an aristocratic family, with a good job to boot, my prospects on the marriage market were bright. In the world of arranged marriages, I was \u201chot property\u201d. Like Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, mothers with daughters of marriageable age who knew my mother or father considered me as the rightful property of their daughters. Discussions of \u201cpossible alliances\u201d were rife, and my mother was having to fend off quite a few of her more aggressive friends.Even though it gave my ego a sort of boost to be so sought after, in my heart of hearts I was intimidated by the thought of marriage. On the one hand, I was an incurable romantic, always falling in love with a pretty girl and writing bad poetry; on the other, my cynical and sarcastic self continuously mocked me. Also, as a rebellious liberal, I was against the whole concept of \u201carranged\u201d marriages. So I shied away from all the proposals, giving the excuse that I was not ready.One day in February 1989, I went into my favourite bookshop and came across an unbelievable book sale where I picked up a bunch of absolutely awesome books for a pittance. I came home, drunk on my luck, when my mother told me that a marriage proposal had come from her classmate and close friend, for her daughter. In the euphoria of getting all those cool tomes, I agreed to see the girl\u2019s photo.I got it a couple of days later, just took one look at it, and fell head over heels in love. A meeting was arranged the coming week; we talked to each other for around 20 minutes and hey presto! I was engaged. We got married that December.We have been together ever since. So I always wonder: is romance all it\u2019s cracked up to be?---------------Pardon this lengthy episode about my marital journey. I was continuously reminded of the \u201cgood old days\u201d while reading this book, especially when I read this:People in arranged marriages start off lukewarm, but over time they really invest in each other and in general have more successful relationships. They are more invested in the deep commitment to the relationship, rather than being personally invested in finding a soul mate, which can tend to lead to the \u201cIs there something better out there for me?\u201d mentality. In the current world of internet dating, I would still probably be \u201cswiping right\u201d on a dating app, looking for that perfect girl waiting out there for me.Aziz Ansari has done a wonderful job of explaining how the digital world has invaded the romantic arena. In olden days, the only hope of meeting a possible partner was out in the real world. If you were a caveman, you just banged the nearest attractive female on the head and dragged her into your cave: in more modern times, you met her in family gatherings, at the workplace and later on, in singles bars. However, since you were geographically limited, there was a limit to your romantic territory. The upside? People got married with someone they found reasonably attractive and settled down.Now, with the advent of the internet, the sky is literally the limit. People can visit dating sites; with dating apps like Tinder, just swiping right on an attractive picture is enough. If the other person also swipes right, you are practically hitched.(This is happening a lot in India too. We have marriage sites where you can filter down the choices caste and state-wise, and pick up a romance which will be easily approved by family. People have started calling them \u201carranged\u201d love marriages. Talk about oxymorons!)However, the downside of this infinite choice that one keeps on window-shopping. Less and less people settle down \u2013 they remain digital Casanovas throughout their life. The relative anonymity provided by computers have a helped a lot of nerdy types get in on the act: so while romance has flourished, marriage has taken a hit. And it does not help that even adultery has become easier with the advent of sexting!My main problem with this book is that Ansari continuously tries to do his stand-up comedy act. It is not needed \u2013 the subject is fascinating by itself. And the jokes fall rather flat in the print medium, I must say.---------------Oh, one last thing \u2013 if I had started my romantic life after the advent of goodreads, I would hazard a guess and say that I\u2019d still be single. I am so hopelessly in love with most of the wonderful ladies out here, that I\u2019d still be debating on whom to bang on the head and drag into my cave. :D"}, {"userName": "Khadidja", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21493936-khadidja", "userReview": "As a single woman I feel like Aziz Ansari knows my pain.

I\u2019m 99.9% sure this guy will never read this review. At least I hope so.I\u2019ll end this with one last quote:\u201cMarriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship. But now we want our partner to still give us all these things, but in addition I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot, and we live twice as long. So we come to one person, and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide: Give me belonging, give me identity, give me continuity, but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one. Give me comfort, give me edge. Give me novelty, give me familiarity. Give me predictability, give me surprise. And we think it\u2019s a given, and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that. Ideally, though, we\u2019re lucky, and we find our soul mate and enjoy that life-changing mother lode of happiness. But a soul mate is a very hard thing to find.\u201dThat\u2019s a lot to ask.

He not only had to write the book, but now he 'had' to read it us us too! Aziz is entertaining and hilarious no questions about it. Love the guy! By the end of my 'lazy- listening'... I came to the conclusion that Aziz brought playfulness and lightness to the game called \"Modern Dating\". However ...'everyone' could benefit listening to this audio tape if you plan to continue living in 2016 and years after. Listening to the different ways people interact through 'texting', opened up my eyes to the generation gap between - me, and my younger generation. I grew up talking on the telephone -- hours a night as a teenager. Every teenage girls dream was to own a princess phone of their own - next to their bed in the mid 60's. I talked with boys, girls, ( one on one), regularly. If a boy had interest in me ...he didn't send a text and say, \"hey\"or \"hey, what's hanging?\" or \"you want to hang out.\" Guys had to speak .. be more direct ...such as, \"hi, would you like to go to a movie with me on Friday night?\" Point is... Social connecting was either in person or on the phone. We didn't have instant messages- text messages to hide behind. I was almost 'shocked' ( but not really), that Aziz was actually TEACHING basic appropriate communication -social skills 101 of how to communicate just sending a text message without sounding like a jerk. (He was doing a great job with many terrific real- examples showing what worked and what didn't work). It's somewhat mind blowing to me that basic common sense skills need to be taught to young single men and women at all! ( AZIZ's refresher course is needed, no question about it). He also made it fun! Nobody gets called out -- this isn't a live seminar. When Aziz explored the changes of dating, romance , and marriage with the previous 50 years...a couple of things stood out as interesting to me. 1. There was a high statistic of people marrying a person who lived in their neighborhood. It was common to marry a person less than 5 minutes from where you grew up. 2. When asked \"why did you marry your wife?\" ...years ago: many of the answers were similar: \"She was nice, we liked each other, and had common values\". Today: when asked ...\"\"why did you marry your spouse?\"...we hear answers like1. He's the other half of me.., and, 2. She's my soulmate.At the start of this book, I said to myself ...\"This book is fun, & informative ...I can talk to my daughters about these issues...ask them questions.. etc..,yet, I'm soooo happy that I AM MARRIED.. ( and happy) In the middle of the book...still enjoying this clever-wise-comedian, and his heterosexual pairing with graphs to boot...I quietly said to myself ...YEP, STILL GLAD I'M MARRIED!!At the end of the audiobook...Having enjoyed a discussion about the beginning's attraction of a great relationship with lust and passion...then moving into the companion phase ----which is next to follow if the couple stays together...Or?might a person move on to another person? Keep that 'Rush' and 'fire' hot? Science makes a good argument for the companion phase. To me, the dating world seems over- stimulating -- too many choices -to the point of maybe not really knowing anyone. Boy next door doesn't look so bad! I'M 'still' happy TO BE MARRIED... ( yet, I suppose there would be nothing worse if a person wished they weren't). I'm blessed in the marriage dept. and I'll be the first to say it. We are both independent - individual - complete whole healthy- soulful human beings ... yet we are emotionally connected with each other in the important areas of life. I enjoyed my lazy time with Aziz. ( THANKS for reading your book to me Aziz). Aziz is a great walking buddy! You don't even need to text him for a date.

He also mentions that he rejected the idea of writing a strictly humorous book because he feels like his stand-up is a more comfortable medium for his comedy ideas and only agreed to do the project if he could center it on serious sociological inquiry.What results is a broad roundup of research studies on shifting attitudes toward marriage and dating, some case studies done through focus groups and Reddit, and a few interviews with social scientists. Unfortunately, the most acute problem with the book is that it's wholly free of any sort of insight or critique. Have you ever thought about the fact that previous generations lived, loved, and died within a narrow geographic and cultural range while today technology allows us to learn about and connect with an almost limitless array of other people and ideas? Would it surprise you to learn that some people in bygone eras felt stifled by limited options while others were content with what was available to them, while some in the current generation feel liberated and others feel paralyzed by choice? It wouldn't?The flatness of the science could be forgiven if the book was funny, but it isn't. Ansari mostly limits himself to joking asides (and even follows most of those up with qualifying statements that they're not meant to be construed as part of the research, as if he or co-author Eric Klinenberg were deathly afraid of being discredited by satirical factoids like saying 0.8% of all couples met on the set of the Nicolas Cage movie Snake Eyes), which seldom rise above observations at the level of \"Have you ever texted someone and then they don't text back right away? What is the deal with that??\". On the whole, his efforts to ground the book in sociological exploration torpedo the humor and the book ultimately doesn't succeed as science or satire.I suppose this would be easy to dismiss as the latest in a long tradition of disposable novelty bathroom reading written by comedians, but knowing that Ansari was given a $3.5 MILLION book deal to produce it can't help but rankle. Save your time-- there's nothing insightful or memorable here at all."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "Aziz Ansari is a funny guy. I've enjoyed his work as an actor and a comedian, so I shouldn't have been surprised when I really liked his book. But I was surprised, especially when I learned that he had teamed up with a sociologist and did actual research on modern romance. Aziz was interested in how technology has changed dating culture, and he opens the book with a funny story about a girl, Tanya, who didn't text him back after he had asked her out. He realizes that texting and social media and dating apps and emojis have become increasingly important in dating and relationships, and he and a sociologist set out to research the subject. For example, they conducted interviews with people from a wide variety of ages and backgrounds, and they even traveled to other countries to get some international data on romance. One aspect of their research I found especially interesting was that online dating sites and apps, such as Match.com and Tinder, have dramatically increased the number of options for people, but having so many choices can be overwhelming. It makes it harder for some people to choose someone, because there are always more profiles to check. One woman told the story of how she would check Tinder before going a date, just in case she saw someone more interesting than the guy she was supposed to meet.I also liked the perspective of elderly folks who were interviewed. Overwhelmingly, the women who got married young wished they hadn't been pressured to find a husband so quickly. Even in cases where the women had relatively happy marriages, they felt a sense of loss because they didn't get a chance to experience being single in their 20s, or have time to live independently, without relying on a parent or a husband to support them.I love sociology, and I thought this book was a delightful blend of Aziz's humor and sociological insights. I listened to this on audio, and Aziz was a very funny performer. He had me laughing within the first minute, and this book made a long road trip seem very short. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the sociology of dating, or who also wants a good laugh."}, {"userName": "Sarah Jane", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8063970-sarah-jane", "userReview": "I think Aziz Ansari just convinced me to get on Tinder?"}, {"userName": "emma", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma", "userReview": "i posted, i posted, i posted! plz be proud of me. link here: https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...------------Disclaimer: I have the biggest crush on Aziz Ansari.

(Thanks again, Sofi. You\u2019re the goods.)In my initial review, I gave this book three-ish stars. That\u2019s because, while the book was interesting, it could get very nonfiction-y. (I\u2019m not that big into nonfiction. How\u2019d you guess?) It generally lacked for Aziz\u2019s voice.Guess what\u2019s not a problem in the audiobook version?IT\u2019S AZIZ ANSARI\u2019S VOICE. Because he reads it. And riffs. And jokes about the laziness of audiobook listeners. (This is particularly fabulous for me, as someone who read the book first, because I get to laugh pretentiously and condescendingly - which is my favorite kind of laughter.) The whole thing is great and I love it so much. Honestly, it\u2019s like a six-hour podcast about love hosted by Aziz Ansari. And that\u2019s a dream I never knew I had.This book isn\u2019t perfect, but think about the impossibility of the task. Ansari and his co-author, Eric Klinenberg, set about to write a book that encapsulates and explains ALL OF MODERN ROMANCE, EVERYWHERE. And on TOP of it, discuss the history of romance and the changes that led us here. They had to place some limits on it.Unfortunately, these limits mean we mostly hear about the Tinder-esque romances formed by straight American twentysomethings. I\u2019d love to hear more about non-straight relationships, or even non-online relationships. But I understand the need to focus on a niche.One AMAZING thing about this book is that it isn\u2019t entirely American. Klinenberg and Ansari visited several other countries to try to get a more global concept, and IT. IS. FASCINATING. Honestly I want the two of them to write a million books like this. Just explain every aspect of society and culture to me via six-hour audiobook, Aziz.The only other downside is that this has a loooot of material from Aziz Ansari\u2019s most-recent-and-still-fairly-old standup special, which I had just watched (okay, rewatched) like a week before starting the audiobook. So that was a lil upsetting. Like John Mulaney\u2019s tragically short-lived self-titled TV show - I\u2019d be so much more on board if I hadn\u2019t heard half of it before.Bottom line: THIS IS SO FUN, but you gotta try the audiobook. 200% more Aziz, and trust me when I say you want as much Aziz as you can get.----------ORIGINAL REVIEW----------3/5the topic of this book was so interesting! i don't think i was alone, however, in expecting a little more aziz in it. it was definitely funnier/an easier read than your typical sociological study but it definitely had its dry portions. all in all worth it, though!"}, {"userName": "Philip", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30863291-philip", "userReview": "4ish stars.Disclaimer: This review contains my life story/abridged relationship history. Do not feel obligated to read it in its entirety, but c'mon it's kind of entertaining. Surprisingly not as funny, but much more insightful than I expected. I guess I figured this would be Master of None in book form with Ansari chronicling specific experiences he's had that reflect dating culture today. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of humor, and Ansari does throw in a few auto-biographical accounts, but it ends up being more of an impressive examination, complete with sociologists, research studies, etc., of the many ways we begin, build, and maintain relationships today. This is compared with norms of the past, showing the way changes in society and technology have shaped the evolution of modern romance. It also let me reflect on my own relationships, including my ongoing marriage of almost three years, and compare them to the experiences of those who were interviewed or otherwise participated in studies/conversations for this book, some of which are very foreign to mine. I'll give you a little glimpse into my humdrum relationship history as I detail my exploits as they apply to some of the points made in this book, and you can compare with your own. :) Names have been changed to protect the innocent.----------1) Barb - circa 2005 - age 16: During high school (and for long after) there was only one girl who could be considered my \"girlfriend\" (even if I have always refused to use that term because it feels cheesy and immature and ugly in my mouth, something about all those consonants mushing together - girlfriend). This was at the end of my junior year of high school - we were in volleyball class together, she asked me to the \"girls pref\" dance, we held hands, and after a few weeks of hanging out, during which time we made it \"official,\" I had my first kiss at 16. It took me 30 minutes of awkwardly lying silently next to her at a park knowing full well she expected me to kiss her, but being too scared to dive in, before I finally bucked up the courage and gave her a fairly chaste kiss. Having gotten the hard part out of the way, I went in for a second, at which point she sucked me in, tongue and all. Her first words afterward were \"you should open your mouth more.\" Not exactly inspiring. When asked how many girls I had kissed, I replied \"just a few.\" \ud83d\ude2c After a month or two I kind of got bored, so I started ghosting her, blowing her off for Harry Potter movie marathons, until she confronted me and I was forced to tell her I wanted to be \"free\" for the summer and my senior year. After a brief period of bitterness, we remained good friends. A few years later, her boyfriend at the time left the country for a while, and since we were good friends, we would hang out together. Alone. In her bed. Until after watching a particularly emotional episode of One Tree Hill we ended up having a NCMO (non-committal make out) until she started crying. Our tryst ended shortly after.Relevant points: - This was 2005. Mobile phones and texting had just started becoming accessible and prevalent among younger common folk like myself. Texting was T9 and I had to monitor my activity because unlimited texting wasn't an option for anyone but the high class. I remember texting being so cool at the time. It hadn't yet taken over lives and transformed communication but it was novel and exciting chatting with friends even if there wasn't much substance beyond \"hey wassup\" \"im good u?\" \"ugh 3rd period english with petersen life sux\" etc. So I never actually experienced dating without cell phones and texting. - It was all about MSN, AIM, and/or Yahoo messenger, which I used and abused. A couple years earlier, right before starting high school, I moved to a different state and these were the only easy ways to keep in contact with old friends. AIM chat rooms could also be utilized as cesspools for carnal desire, internet sex, and the dawn of catfishing, but that wasn't my style.- Social media as we now recognize it was fairly new. Myspace was a serious thing and I seem to remember it as being considered kind of edgy at first. My parents refused to let me get a Myspace so I had to keep mine secret. Again, it was fun to connect with friends, post comments, expect replies, and cause scandals based on who was selected as a \"top eight friend\" or whatever it was. It was also used by some as a way to hook up.-As is common today, guys were overwhelmingly expected to initiate relationships, but I was awkward and shy and it just wasn't me, so it's a good thing Barb had an excuse to ask me out because I wouldn't have made a move otherwise. Similarly, I eventually didn't want to be with her anymore, but didn't have the guts to say so (and breaking up over text would have been seriously uncool). So I ignored her texts until she forced my hand. I am not proud of myself. I also couldn't decide whether I should have felt guilty about making out with her while her kind-of boyfriend was in another country.- I was thereafter notorious for my many flirtationships, but nothing serious happened for a long time until...----------2) Mildred - circa 2011 - age 22: I ended up meeting Mildred after moving in with a buddy who was very social and outgoing. So the opposite of me. But I kind of became social by association? We had people over all the time and somehow I became kind of cool because my house was the cool place to be. I had a fairly wide circle of friends and Mildred somehow entered that circle despite her being way out of the circle's league. She was not even on my radar until I realized we were flirting a lot and she was giving me a lot of signs and making it really easy for me to ask her out. I was a giant dork, and ridiculously immature, while she had poise and beauty and confidence, so it was inevitable that things wouldn't last long. I tried so hard to be \"romantic\" and to make things special, so even after we were \"official,\" I didn't even kiss her for a long time because I was waiting for the perfect Hallmark moment. In hindsight this was stupid and naive and I wish I would have moved things a lot faster. After three months (my longest relationship until marriage), she ended things very maturely, in person, while I was completely oblivious to the fact that our relationship had been gradually declining for a while. She gave an excuse that I could never determine the legitimacy of, and let me down gently by suggesting that we \"take a break,\" leaving a hypothetical door open, even though we both knew the door would never be used again. We remained friends and continued to hang out in the same crowd.Relevant points: - Of course smartphones were a thing at this point. Social media could be accessed at any second and the obsessiveness with likes and comments began. Texting had become my preferred mode of communication; I had conversations of increasing depth and took my time crafting the perfect messages. I also started playing the game of not texting back for the same amount of time it took to receive my last reply. I never answered calls unless it was family, or I was expecting a call, and even then preferred to ignore calls and text back instead. Basically I became a much better texter/writer than talker. It all went downhill from there.- Myspace was dead and Facebook was king. Friend invites were sent to even the most distant acquaintances because it didn\u2019t require asking for phone numbers, and it was considered the greatest offense to \"unfriend\" someone. An acquaintance/emerging friend of mine had previously told me that he had a giant crush on Mildred, and after I broke \"bro code\" and started dating her he unfriended me. Everyone I told this to was shocked that he had taken things so far. I remember posting things on other people's Facebook walls that I never would have in person, or even through text. Something about it being open and public made it easier, less intimate.- I opened an Instagram account which, at the time, seemed like a simpler, less social platform than Facebook, not a way to connect or meet people. Snapchat was the newest thing and word on the street was that it was used mainly to send dick pics.- Dating websites were big, and I tinkered with them a bit. Of course, they all cost money and I was a starving college student, so this never went anywhere. I had a legitimate conversation with maybe one person but it ended quickly. I didn't understand how dating sites could be successful for so many people. - I went to community college but was too shy to talk to anyone so I came and went without ever making a single friend. I decided that I could probably only ever date someone with whom I was already friends. Blind dates were all duds so I felt like I would need to have some kind of existing relationship in order for things to progress to a relationship. I lucked out by having such a social roommate through whom I became friends with so many people. ----------3) Betty- circa 2013 - age 24: One word. Tinder. Game changer. I ended up going on a ton of Tinder dates around this time. While simultaneously being embarrassed that I was going on a ton of Tinder dates, and making up creative alternative meet-cutes. I only ended up going on multiple dates with a handful of girls, and only one or two matches in particular turned into relationships but they were fairly solid by my standards. Betty came about during a time when I was trying hard to go on second dates with these Tinder girls. I figured I had to give them second chances because it's hard to get to know a person in an hour or two, especially when the only thing you know you have in common is that you both liked the other person's idealized presentation of themselves. Betty evolved from a typical Tinder girl that I didn't feel much chemistry with, to a full-blown relationship. I'm almost ashamed to admit that one of the biggest factors that led to our breakup was that she lived like 30 minutes away and I didn't want to drive out to see her. We'd switch off driving to see the other person so I only had to drive down once a week or so but I decided it wasn't worth it. Apparently the most attractive quality in a woman for me was close proximity? In other news I finally had the guts to break up with her myself, in person even, at a Cafe Zupas.Relevant points: - Up until Tinder, I relied on my friends to set me up on dates or to bring new people into our social circles that I could get to know. I felt like I burned through all of those options pretty quickly and didn't know how to meet new people. Through Tinder I connected with a lot of girls. It was brilliant. Look at someone's picture and a short blurb of how they describe themselves and make a snap judgment about whether you're interested or not. Basically the dating equivalent of Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. The beauty was that so many people were using it that I could never run out of people to swipe through. The downside was that all of the girls who I matched with (who I thought were my type) lived in the college town 30 minutes away with Betty. - Of all the girls I followed up with after a date via text, only a fraction ever responded, the others deciding to pretend I didn't exist. I still felt obligated as the dude to initiate the follow-up, but unless I was feeling it I wouldn't contact the girl again and that was that. On the rare occasion a girl texted me after a date and I wasn't interested, I told them so, but otherwise never talked to the girls I didn't connect with again. - Betty wasn't pleased with our breakup and told me that I needed to let myself give our relationship a fair chance. That I would never have a healthy relationship until I opened up and allowed a legitimate connection to develop. Wise words. We never talked again but never actually deleted each other from social media, and I occasionally stalked her to see how she was getting on. She's now married with a kid whose face I would occasionally see on Facebook. Weird?----------4) Stacia - circa 2014-present - age 26-29: I ended up meeting my wife at church. Isn't that so lame and old-fashioned? My church does this thing where they set up congregations entirely composed of young, single adults, seemingly in an effort to get us to marry each other. I always thought it was ridiculous and incestuous to date people in my surrounding neighborhood, who I would otherwise see on a regular basis. Not to mention how dated and close-minded I thought it was to only go out with people of my own religion. I had a strict policy against dating people from church. I attended for the religious aspect and because my friends went. Also, Stacia and I did not have good first impressions of each other. I was still living with my social friend and we still had regular gatherings that led her to believe that I was a cocky douchebag who had girls fawning over me. For my part, I had a few friends/acquaintances who all claimed to have gone out with Stacia and who were then given the cold shoulder by her because she was stuck up/promiscuous. Eventually our circles of church friends overlapped and we became comfortable with each other. She realized I was a doofus, not a playboy, and in turn assured me that those guys who claimed to have hooked up with her only wished they could have, that she would never have actually given them the time of day. We grew to greet each other, tease each other, give each other dating advice, and set each other up with our friends. Then it was like a switch flipped. All of a sudden I realized I was in love with her, and as luck would have it, she had the same epiphany at the same time. We dated for six months before I proposed and were married six months after that. Almost three years on, I love her now more than ever.Final thoughts: - Obviously I ended up marrying someone I met IRL. We would text each other occasionally while we were dating but it was mostly to figure out when we'd see each other next. Maybe phone/internet dating would have worked for me eventually, as it has for many of my friends, but I had a lot more success meeting people organically. - Not gonna lie, I was always kind of a prude. I never really dated for fun, I dated to get into relationships. I never even kissed girls until I felt like we were sufficiently serious. I'm pretty sure I'm quite anomalous in that regard. Looking back would I have done anything different? Oh yeah. I would have had way many more NCMOs. Seriously. I think I missed out on a lot during my single years by being so rigid. Call it gentlemanly, but I now look back and realize there's nothing wrong with being emotional/passionate/affectionate with a lot of people just for the fun of it. I still can't bring myself to accept the idea of being in serious relationships with multiple people at the same time, but I feel like there's no harm in going on dates with lots of people until someone special emerges. - I'm also fully aware that I kept my romantic life in a very traditional bubble, even while I was watching all of my friends engage in much more progressive, open experiences consistent with current, common dating culture in the US. I'm fine with it, and luckily, it ended up working for me. It's interesting looking back, pondering these things, and comparing my ideas (then and now) to the ideas expressed by people in this book. If nothing else, it's insightful in that regard and makes me want to force it on my single friends. :)Posted in Mr. Philip's Library"}, {"userName": "Glenn Sumi", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi", "userReview": "Bravo to comic and actor Aziz Ansari for not writing just another memoir-by-someone-who\u2019s-sorta-famous-but-hasn\u2019t-lived-long-enough-to-really-warrant-one. I\u2019ve read a number of them (good: Bossypants; okay: Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?; abandoned: sorry, Lena Dunham).Modern Romance is about dating in the digital age. Getting to know people has evolved significantly even over the past few years. Dating sites, swipe apps like Tinder and sexting are a far cry from how people used to meet \u2013 you know, through friends and family; answering personal ads; video dating, where you watch potential partners' VHS tapes (!); braving noisy, crowded bars\u2026.Ansari has teamed up with NYU sociology professor Eric Klinenberg for the book, so there are many quotes from experts and plenty of facts, figures and even some graphs. There are also lots of jokey elements, like dorky photos (Ansari imagines what his online stalker looks like) and fake footnotes (okay, I laughed at a silly Betty Friedan footnote). The two also drew on lots of research from SubReddit, focus groups and Ansari\u2019s stand-up. A few years ago I saw Ansari perform live, during the time he was doing research. One of the highlights was when he asked audience members if they\u2019d recently met someone and, if so, if he could read out recent text exchanges involving that person. He draws on some of those exchanges from that tour in the book.If, like me, you\u2019re single, you probably already know a lot of what's in this book. The whole project feels a tad lightweight, like an extended magazine article you skim in the waiting room of the doctor\u2019s office.But there are a few fascinating revelations, like the difference between successful women\u2019s and men\u2019s online dating profile pictures (apparently women should look directly at the camera, while men should look away) and how if someone\u2019s \u201cundecided\u201d about liking your pic and profile you\u2019ll think about them a lot more than if someone downright likes it. (Note: Aziz admits at the outset that the book is primarily about heterosexual relationships and most of the research was done with middle-class people.)But by far the most fascinating sections in the book are about dating practices in other countries: Qatar, Japan, France. Aziz jokes that he chose many of these cultures for their culinary offerings, but there are some sharp observations here. People in Japan are so private they often use a pet \u2013 or an inanimate object, like their RICE COOKER! \u2013 for their profile pics.And the section on France opens up a big issue about monogamy and open relationships. You know who also weighs in on open relationships? The hip-hop star Pitbull. And he\u2019s pretty articulate. Ansari also chronicles his own relationship history, which has gone from single to dating to seriously dating. He\u2019s candid about it all, even letting us see actual text exchanges between him and his lady friend to illustrate how some digital communication can be misinterpreted. And while there are jaw-dropping revelations about the idiots out there in cyberspace's scary single\u2019s world \u2013 adolescent males come under fire for their less than original texts \u2013 there are lots of success stories, too. So there are plenty of happy endings.

Fast forward to November, when I discovered the wonder that is the Hidden Brain podcast, where it featured an episode with Aziz Ansari sharing laugh-out-loud funny excerpts from\u00a0Modern Romance. After having a genuinely good time listening to his voice on the podcast,\u00a0I was convinced to take another shot with the audiobook.And having watched and completely loved Ansari's Netflix show\u00a0Master of None\u00a0back in \u00a0May when the second season was released\u00a0(check out my\u00a0May 2017 Reading Wrap Up\u00a0to read more of my ravings on that), I was more than ready to dive back into his world. Plus, I'm glad I got to read the book a while after having watched the show because the many parallels of my favorite scenes from the show being present in here were beyond gratifying to experience again.\n SourceModern Romance\u00a0interweaves stream of consciousness storytelling with scientific research that will ultimately make you see your own life through a different lens. Thankfully, though,\u00a0the book has a generous mix of absurdity and depth.\u00a0Aziz Ansari tackles head-on the subject of culture and technology and the ways they've shaken romance, and he provides us with\u00a0\u201ca much richer understanding of the new romantic landscape.\u201d But Ansari never fails to include a much-needed comical anecdote or\u00a0food reference to lighten up the text. Speaking of which, here's a passage from the first chapter that\u00a0sealed the deal for me:\u201cTo be honest, I tend to romanticize the past, and though I appreciate all the conveniences of modern life, sometimes I yearn for simpler times. Wouldn\u2019t it be cool to be single in a bygone era? I take a girl to a drive-in movie, we go have a cheeseburger and a malt at the diner, and then we make out under the stars in my old-timey convertible. Granted, this might have been tough in the fifties given my brown skin tone and racial tensions at the time, but in my fantasy, racial harmony is also part of the deal.\u201dThat\u2019s my exact thought process with people who tend to romanticize the past.The only downfall to this book was that, though it highlights\u00a0a vast set of issues related to modern romance and\u00a0emerging adulthood, it does\u00a0so in a very narrowed down look, specifically centered around American middle-class straight couples. But to\u00a0give credit where credit is due, there are a couple of chapters dedicated to exploring romance in other parts of the world, such as\u00a0Buenos Aires, Tokyo, Paris, and Doha.All in all: I'm just glad I\u00a0finally got around to reading Aziz Ansari's\u00a0Modern Romance with the end of the year in sight.\nNote: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

It doesn't commit (get the pun?) one way or the other, and so, falls flat on both fronts. This is especially unsatisfying as I love Aziz and his work. Perhaps it's with this high expectation and skewed notion of what this book could have been that made it all the more disheartening. The quicker you accept the fact that \"Modern Romance\" isn't what you wished it was, the easier you'll find yourself enjoying it a little more.It isn't a laugh-out-loud humourous kind of book, even though I did chuckle at bits here and there; it isn't a scholarly body of sociological work that expounds new facts, even though I did relate to the online dating experiences recounted in \"Modern Romance\". In this itself, I suppose, I found the humour and comfort knowing that this digital age of romance is as wacked up as I find it to be from my own familiarity of it. What further makes \"Modern Romance\" a passable book for me was Aziz Ansari himself - the narrator was undeniably of the voice of Ansari and the jokes were unmistakably in the tone of his humour. So if you're a fan of him, great, you're likely going to enjoy \"Modern Romance\". Otherwise, like a text conversation that dies off or a forgettable date, there's nothing you're missing here that you didn't already know about digital dating if you skipped this book."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "The knowledge offered in this book is pretty common and obvious, nothing you haven't read online/heard on a podcast.

I grew up in the 90's and early 00's, so I didn't have my own cell phone until I was closer to an adult and even these days, I'm not big into social media (GR is about it for my social media life). So I guess I kind of got to experience some of both dating times. This book also made me supremely happy that I'm already in a relationship and not dealing with the single life games.

You know the kind with advice like \"Ladies, don't call him back right away!\" kind of thing. This is not that kind of book. Ansari worked with a sociologist to look at love in the modern age. He covers everything from texting to sexting to Tinder and how love/romance has changed due to technology. I really like that the book took a more academic approach. Because it's Aziz, it's also still funny. If you've seen his standup or enjoy him on Parks & Rec, you will enjoy the tone of the writing, it really comes across well in print. Overall, a great, fun read.

I'm a huge fan of Ansari. I think he's cute as a button and funny as goddamn hell. I watched him in Parks & Rec, his most recent Netflix original Master of None (which I highly recommend), and thoroughly enjoy his stand-up concerts. He's not at the same level as Louis CK or Patton Oswalt, but he's also a lot younger than these gentlemen who have been honing their dark and brilliant comedy for decades now.Modern Romance is not your typical \"comedian writes a book\" fare. It's not a memoir, or a book filled with ruminations on the life of a comedian. It's a thinky piece, backed up by real sociological research, with pie charts and everything! Ansari's approach to breaking down the ins and outs of dating and hooking up and settling down in the 21st century is as intriguing and compelling as it is infectious and informative. I loved every minute of it. The layout is light and breezy, and super accessible without distilling and dumbing down the subject matter too much as to be insulting to its audience. Ansari wants to make you laugh, make no mistake, but he's also very earnest in his desire to tell you what he's learned. And can I just say I find all of it utterly FASCINATING. I'm addicted to \"meet cute\" stories (even though I would never consider myself a romantic, and have an averse reaction to rom-com movies -- that make me break out in hives). But how people meet and when they decide \"to put a ring on it\" (or not) can always get my attention. I have to check myself from being perpetually nosy all of the time, getting the \"deets\" on all this stuff from my friends, both of the online and the in real life variety. For me, this book is too short. With its laudable success my hope is that Ansari will be compelled to pen a follow-up, because if there's one thesis that comes chiming out loud and clear here, it's that the 21st century dating world is changing fast, at warp speed, impacting how we communicate with one another, form bonds and friendships, and take that scary running leap into \"the big commitment\". A lot of the current research being done is showing that the bonds we form online, platonic or otherwise, can no longer be dismissed so easily as superficial and suffering by comparison to those we forge \"IRL\" (in real life). I do believe most of us on this site would concur that social media has opened up a \"brave new world\" that's not just brighter and more vibrant, but has proven increasingly successful in bringing colorful people into our lives that we otherwise would not have known existed, friendships that we now rely upon and cherish. And that \"modern romance\" is blooming out of those virtual connections should really be coming as no surprise to anyone. Ansari does an excellent job of pointing out the pros and cons of modern romance in the 21st century in all its tech'd out, geeked out splendor. We now have more choice than ever before, all at our fingertips with the click of a button or the swipe of a screen, but that landslide of choices might also be paralyzing some of us into making any choice at all. Our standards and expectations for a lifelong partnership might have been raised to exceptionally high, unreasonable levels too. With all that choice at our fingertips, why would we settle for anything less than AMAZING? That perfect \"soul mate\" who is going to fulfill every single one of our needs every day for the rest of our days. Pfft, people you know this: that person does not exist. But it's not all bad news. Technology has not ruined romance for us living in the 21st century. In fact, for many of us, especially women -- things have improved vastly. Not because of the tech component, but because women are no longer expected to settle down as early as possible. We can invest in our careers now, and date more and live life as a single, learning about ourselves and the things that are going to make us happy if we do decide to pair off. There are many areas (due to space constraints) that this book by necessity leaves unaddressed or goes light on, and Ansari is very good about pointing those out at the beginning. One thing missing for me is a breakdown of dating from an extrovert versus introvert point of view. I think our current technology has been an absolute miracle and marvel to introverts who struggle to put themselves out there in the real world of bars and supermarkets and church basements, but are absolutely charming and brave and socially high functioning on the interwebs. It's been an essential transition for that half of the human population to discover their \"tribe\" and connect in meaningful ways to people it would have been extremely unlikely they would have ever met IRL. (and it's here I'm going to put a plug in for Felicia Day's memoir You're Never Weird on the Internet who also describes this \"social revolution\" for introverts in a way that resonated with me completely).So in case it isn't obvious by now, I loved this book and I think everyone should read it, young/old, guy/girl, married/single. While it's easy to despair of the human race, and we know there are too many assholes and unforgivable idiots and sneaky jerkfaces running around out there, human behaviour and why we do the shit we do is still endlessly fascinating, isn't it? I think so."}, {"userName": "Nenia \u2728 Queen of Literary Trash, Protector of Out-of-Print Gems, Khaleesi of Bodice Rippers, Mother of Smut, the Unrepentant, Breaker of Convention \u2728 Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190064-nenia-queen-of-literary-trash-protector-of-out-of-print-gems-khalees", "userReview": "Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestThere are a lot of books that I am interested in reading but don't really get around to unless the book is selected by a book club or for a buddy read. This is because sites like Amazon and Goodreads have made the whole prospect of choosing a book so stressful. Up-and-coming books, out-of-print books, esoteric books from small presses - there are so many options. Before Goodreads, I would select books based on the cover, the synopsis on the back cover, and whether I recognized the author (usually from a magazine or a friend/family member's suggestion). Now? I have books thrown at me from all directions in the form of ebook sales, ARCs, and thrift shops, and it's so overwhelming, because there are so many books I want to read, and I have a finite amount of time to get through them all. It's frustrating, to say the least.Why is this relevant? Because Aziz Ansari takes this same concept: the infinite permutations of options offered to us in the digital age and the difficulty of prioritizing or selecting between them. Only, instead of books, he applies it to dating and relationships. When we use dating apps, we're exposed to way more people than we would ever encounter in real life (sometimes, in the case of d*ck pics, 'exposed' in the literal sense), in cities that we have never personally been to, with interests way outside of our own social groups.While this is compelling, and in some cases - especially in the cases of those with specific sexual needs/desires or niche hobbies - extremely beneficial, Ansari argues that this can actually be detrimental for others. He argues that in the old days, people often married someone they knew, and became complacent about their partner, with a sense of compansionship that occurred later on from shared history and interests. In the modern age, people are far less willing to settle down, he argues, constantly wondering what's behind that figurative door number two. Is it someone better? Are we missing out? Digital dating might help us find people, but it also makes us less willing to stay with people, and can enable us to cheat or indulge in flaky behavior like text breakups or flimsy plans.I was expecting this to be a dating memoir, so you could cover me shocked when I found out that one of my favorite male comedians was writing a semi-scientific book about dating habits in the modern age (hence the title), with a focus group he created, information gleaned from a subreddit set up by him, and many, many studies cited from actual sociologists and psychologists, and literature I'm actually acquainted with, such as Barry Schwartz'z PARADOX OF CHOICE and Sheena Iyengar's THE ART OF CHOOSING (both must-reads, even if you're not a psych major). I studied psychology in college because I love finding out what makes people tick. I knew this was going to be good.And it was!Ansari covers a wide variety of topics, starting from how older people in his focus groups met their spouses and what their motiviations for marriage were, and what their courtship rituals looked like. He discusses various dating sites at length, as well as their humble origins in speed dating and video dating, as well as touching upon hookup culture. He also talks about what dating looks like in different parts of the world. He discusses the U.S., but also what dating looks like in Qatar, in Argentina, in Japan, and in France, and how their attitudes are changing in the modern age, as well.While this book is drier than some would like, I think it's especially relevant to anyone who has dated in the 21st century or anyone who rolls their eyes at people who say, \"I just can't find anyone\" when they live in a city with several million people for being overdramatic. Finding people is hard. Finding people to settle down with is even harder. Ansari manages to take a very complicated topic and do an admirable job of examining it from multiple perspectives, while also keeping it fresh with light humor that I imagined him delivering in a Tom Haverford sort of tone.P.S. When Ansari talks about the present his girlfriend his girlfriend got him for their 1 year, I smiled so hard my cheeks hurt. 3.5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Roy Lotz", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz", "userReview": "One firm takeaway from all our interviews with women is that most dudes out there are straight-up bozos.\nMy introduction to modern romance was abrupt and unexpected. I was back in New York for the holidays, drinking with a few friends, sipping and gulping the wonderful IPAs that I miss when I\u2019m here in Spain. Sometime deep into the night, one of my friends, who is a gay man\u2014this is relevant to the story; you should also know that I\u2019m a straight guy\u2014asked if anyone wanted to go on his Tinder. \u201cI do!\u201d I said, and soon found myself face to face with the infamous app for the first time in my life. Now, for the three remaining people who don\u2019t know how Tinder works, it\u2019s very simple: You look at pictures of people, and swipe left if you don\u2019t want to talk to them, right if you do. (In this respect it's like the Last Judgment.) If someone you\u2019ve approved of also approves of you, then you are both given the option to send messages.My friend was obviously a stud, because I was getting matches left and right (well, only right). One of these matches was a young man who I\u2019ll call Woodrow Wilson. With permission from my friend, I sent Woodrow a message. The conversation went something like this:Me: What\u2019s your favorite tree?Woodrow Wilson: Uh, White Pines are pretty cool I guess.Me: White Pines? So clich\u00e9.Woodrow Wilson: You\u2019re right, I was only testing the waters. I\u2019m really fond of Quaking Aspens. You?Me: Now we\u2019re talking. I\u2019ve always been fond of the Shagbark Hickory. The conversation proceeded like this for about four days, by which time it was clear that I had found my soul mate through my gay friend\u2019s Tinder. Unfortunately, many barriers stood in the way\u2014I\u2019m straight, I was going back to Spain, and I was basically deceiving him\u2014so I didn\u2019t meet Woodrow Wilson. (If you ever read this\u2014hello, and sorry!) But the experience was enough to make me curious about the opportunities and hazards of romance in the modern world.Being a reluctant single, a very reluctant millennial, and a very, very reluctant member of the modern world, you can imagine I was, well, reluctant to tackle this topic. This book enticed me, not because it was written by Aziz Ansari\u2014I didn\u2019t consider myself a fan, and in college I even passed up the opportunity to see him live on campus\u2014but because he teamed up with a sociologist, Eric Klinenberg, to write it. I listened to the audiobook, nasally narrated by Aziz.The most striking thing about this book is that, despite its lighthearted tone and frequent funny asides, it is basically a serious and even an earnest book. Sociological statistics, psychological studies, and anthropological analyses are mixed with anecdotes and interviews and a bit of humor to give a quick but surprisingly thorough tour of romance in the contemporary world.Aziz begins by pointing out that dating in today\u2019s world is strikingly different from dating in my grandparents\u2019 or even my parents\u2019 generation. This is not only because of advances in technology but, more importantly, because of shifts in values. We now have developed what you might call a perfectionistic attitude towards finding a partner. We want to find a \u201csoul mate,\u201d \u201cthe one,\u201d somebody who fulfills us and thrills us. Aziz contrasts this with what he calls the \u201cgood enough\u201d marriages of yesteryears\u2014finding a partner that satisfies some basic criteria, like having a job and a shiny pocket watchI myself have noticed this shift from studying anthropology and history. In cultures all around the world\u2014and in the West until quite recently\u2014marriages were considered a communal affair. Aziz\u2019s own parents had an arranged marriage, and according to him have had a long, successful relationship. (To be honest the idea of an arranged marriage has always been strangely appealing to me, since I don\u2019t think any decision of such importance should be left in my hands. But the rest of my generation disagrees, apparently, so now I\u2019m left to rummage through apps.)Connected to this rise in the \u201csoul mate\u201d marriage is a rise in our preoccupation with romantic love. According to the biological anthropologist, Helen Fisher, there are two distinct types of love in the human brain: romantic, and companionate. Romantic love is the kind that writes bad poetry; companionate love is the kind that does the dishes. Romantic love hits early in a relationship and lasts up to a year and a half; companionate love grows slowly over time, perhaps over decades. This division accords well with my own experience. (Parenthetically, I have long been skeptical, even morbidly suspicious, of romantic love: that kind of idealizing, gushing, delicious, walking on air feeling. To me it seems to be a form of self-deception, convincing yourself that your partner is perfect, even divine, and that nobody else in the world could make you so happy\u2014when the truth is that your partner is a flawed person, only one of many flawed people who could induce the same delirious sensation. Wow, I sound really bitter in this paragraph.)This cultural shift has been bolstered by our new dating technology. Now we do not only have the expectation that we can find the perfect partner, but we have the tools to do the searching. I can, and sometimes do, scroll through hundreds of faces on my phone per day. All this is very exciting; never before could I have so many romantic options at my fingertips. But there are some major drawbacks to this. One is what the psychologist Barry Schwartz called the \u201cparadox of choice.\u201d Although you\u2019d think having more options would make people more satisfied, in fact the reverse occurs. I remember watching TV was a lot more fun when I was a kid and I only had a few dozen channels; when we upgraded to hundreds of channels, it became stressful\u2014what if there was something better on? Similarly, after spending three months in a camp in Kenya, eating whatever I was given, I found it overwhelming to go to a pizza place and order. How could I choose from so many toppings?Along with these broader observations is a treasure trove of statistics and anecdotes that, if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll be quoting and misquoting for weeks. I found the little vignettes on the dating cultures in Japan, where there\u2019s a sex crisis, Buenos Aires, where there\u2019s a machismo crisis, and Paris, where there\u2019s lots of infidelity but apparently no crisis, to be particularly memorable. These anecdotes are not just for mental titillation, but are used to support several tenets of dating advice. Here are just a few takeaways. Check your punctuation before you send a text. When you ask someone out on a date, include a specific time and location, not \u201cwanna hang out some time?\u201d vagueness. Texting people is not a reliable way to gauge if you\u2019ll like them in person; it\u2019s best to ask them out sooner and not prolong a meaningless texting conversation. Take the time to get to know people; seldom do you see the more interesting side of someone\u2019s personality on a first date.As you can see, this book is quite a rare hybrid: part social science, and part self-help, and part comedy. And yet the book rarely feels disorganized or scatterbrained. Aziz keeps a tight rein on his materials; the writing is compact, clever, and informative. With the notable limitation that this book deals only with heterosexual couples, and covers no topic in serious depth, I can say that it\u2019s hard for me to imagine how any such short book could give so complete a picture of modern romance. Most impressive is the human touch. What could have potentially been a mere smattering of facts and stories, Aziz makes into a coherent whole by grounding everything in the day-to-day frustrations and realities of the dating world. Aziz knows firsthand how much dating can suck, how tiresome, uncomfortable, and stressful it can be. Yet, for all this, the book is ultimately hopeful. Behind all these shifts in values and demographics, all the innovations in dating technologies and changes in romantic habits, all the horror stories and the heartbreaks\u2014beyond the lipstick and the cologne, the collared shirts and high heeled shoes, the loud music and the strong liquor\u2014is the universal human itch to connect. This itch has always been with us and always will be. Each generation just learns to scratch it in new and interesting ways.(To any interested parties, please direct all inquiries to my mom.)"}, {"userName": "Jo\u00e3o Carlos", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17544299-jo-o-carlos", "userReview": "\u201dO Amor nos Tempos Modernos\u201d \u00e9 uma obra liter\u00e1ria escrita por Aziz Ansari (n. 1983), um actor e comediante, que come\u00e7ou a sua carreira em stand-up comedy em Nova Iorque, em parceira com Eric Klinenberg (n. 1970), um investigador e professor de Sociologia na Universidade de Nova Iorque. \u201dConvidar algu\u00e9m para sair \u00e9 uma tarefa simples que muitas vezes se transforma numa aterradora inc\u00f3gnita povoada de medo, d\u00favidas e ansiedade.

I know what you're thinking, and so did Aziz, \"Another comedian book, another fluffed out 200 page book with anecdotes that probably didn't happen\". This is not that type of book at all.Aziz was interested in how dating works these days and decided to team up with a proper social scientist to do some research. And it seems like he was heavily invested in it all. The new research that Aziz and Eric Kbinenberg did was mainly anecdotal, consisting of focus groups and online questionnaires, but it still gave fascinating data and resulted in a lot of thought. Interspersed is other research pertaining to aspects that the authors were discussing. It all made for a different mix of anecdotes, researched social science and Aziz being a goofy ding dong through the whole book.I guess that mix would piss off some readers. It really is intended for a casual audience, but one that still likes data and research. But anyone critical of their methods or the style of the book should not be whingeing at all, it's all spelled out clearly in the introduction. So it was even a hit with an old guy like me, who has been in a monogamous relationship for just over a decade. My partner laughed that I was looking for tips.

His reason behind the choise was that it's a whole another thing and he could write a whole another book about the community. That different aspects of dating apply to this group of people and he simply wouldn't be able to do justice. I call it bullshit. LGBT is not a group of people from different species! Why did author really excluded this group? Do they date differently? Have different chalanges while looking for a partner? React differently after being stood up? Have different values?

Do you ever wonder why people don't text you back within moments of you texting them despite the fact that you can see that they've read the text? If any of this applies to you, then you need to do yourself a favour and dig into Aziz Ansari's book. This gorgeously bound book beautifully dodges all the pitfalls of a nonfiction book by being relentlessly funny, and avoids being lumped in with books by comedians by being supremely educational.  First, a confession: I've become an immense Aziz Ansari acolyte over the course of the Autumn. I watched all of \"Master of None\" when it premiered on Netflix and would easily place it as one of my favourite shows of the year. So, when I heard that Ansari had written a book with a renowned sociologist about love and romance? I was sold and primed to enjoy the read long before it came into my hands as a Christmas gifts. So, fair warning, I loved this one, this will be a standing-O of a review. Ansari spent a year traveling the globe, polling and questioning people about love and romance from a wide swath of age ranges. What he found out was pretty interesting. The statistics presented in this volume are on high quality paper with great looking graphs (pretty much what everyone in your local bookstore is hunting for when flipping through covers). Though I'll admit that many nonfiction books can end up being an endless fact slog, Ansari makes esoteric sociological jargon accessible through his illustrative, and often humorous, explanations. You'll be able to grasp sociological concepts quickly through ludicrous examples, and statistics are presented to illustrate huge gaps and differences between expected and experimental results. The stats are never difficult to interpret or require extensive head-scratching. If this all sounds a bit heady, fret not casual reader, for Ansari is talking about stuff that you deal with everyday! I found the section on texting etiquette in burgeoning relationships to be eye-opening and applicable outside of the realm of romance. The examination of other cultures' dating scenes was both interesting and helpful to illustrate universal norms between cultures. What's more, the material throughout grounds the seemingly-mundane experiences of searching for relationships and moving into long-term relationships by acknowledging that no one is alone in these experience. To conclude: read this book. You'll not be disappointed if you are a fan of Ansari's humour, and the nigh-ubiquitous subject matter makes it an easy recommendation for your struggling single 20-something friend and your middle-aged parent. I had neat conversations with my grandparents about how they met and spoke with my parents about how social media changes the way in which we meet. The only limitation to the entire book is that it deals exclusively with heterosexual relationships, with only the odd touch on LTBGQ relationships. With that said, I can't recommend this book enough. It is funny, educational, and heartfelt.

Too bad it's late for me to vote for this in the non-fiction category."}], "description": "Now a New York Times BestsellerA hilarious, thoughtful, and in-depth exploration of the\u00a0pleasures and perils of modern romance from one of this generation\u2019s sharpest comedic voicesAt some point, every one of us embarks on a journey to find love. We meet people, date, get into and out of relationships, all with the hope\u00a0of finding someone with whom we share a deep\u00a0connection. This seems standard now, but it\u2019s\u00a0wildly different from what people did even just\u00a0decades ago. Single people today have more\u00a0romantic options than at any point in human\u00a0history. With technology, our abilities to connect\u00a0with and sort through these options are staggering.\u00a0So why are so many people frustrated?Some of our problems are unique to our time.\u00a0\u201cWhy did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?\u201d\u00a0\u201cShould I go out with this girl even though she\u00a0listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods?\u00a0Combos?!\u201d \u201cMy girlfriend just got a message from\u00a0some dude named Nathan. Who\u2019s Nathan? Did he\u00a0just send her a photo of his penis? Should I check\u00a0just to be sure?\u201d\u00a0But the transformation of our romantic lives\u00a0can\u2019t be explained by technology alone. In a short\u00a0period of time, the whole culture of finding love\u00a0has changed dramatically. A few decades ago,\u00a0people would find a decent person who lived in\u00a0their neighborhood. Their families would meet\u00a0and, after deciding neither party seemed like a\u00a0murderer, they would get married and soon have\u00a0a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today,\u00a0people marry later than ever and spend years of\u00a0their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a\u00a0soul mate.For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his\u00a0comic insight at modern romance, but for Modern\u00a0Romance, the book, he decided he needed to take\u00a0things to another level. He teamed up with NYU\u00a0sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive\u00a0research project, including hundreds of interviews\u00a0and focus groups conducted everywhere from\u00a0Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzed\u00a0behavioral data and surveys and created their own\u00a0online research forum on Reddit, which drew\u00a0thousands of messages. They enlisted the world\u2019s\u00a0leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen\u00a0Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry\u00a0Turkle, and Robb Willer. The result is unlike any\u00a0social science or humor book we\u2019ve seen before.In Modern Romance, Ansari combines his\u00a0irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science\u00a0to give us an unforgettable tour of our new\u00a0romantic world.", "title": "Modern Romance", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23453112-modern-romance", "average": 3.85, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1432335014l/23453112.jpg", "reviews": 11709, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9802136.Aziz_Ansari", "name": "Aziz Ansari"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2611.Eric_Klinenberg", "name": "Eric Klinenberg"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Humor", "Audiobook"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23453112-modern-romance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25147880-modern-romance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30233340-o-amor-nos-tempos-modernos", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28939133-modern-romance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27407258-buried-alive", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28258113-dangerously-delicious", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28258127-intimate-moments-for-a-sensual-evening", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36365825-everything-is-horrible-and-wonderful", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
