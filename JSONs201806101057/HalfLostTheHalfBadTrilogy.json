Wow. This book destroyed me. I admit I had some reservations after  Half Wild, but  Sally Green redeemed herself and ended this series the way it deserves. I'm at such a loss for words. I need some time to gather my thoughts.Okay, I think I can write this review now. When I say this book destroyed me, I 100% mean it. The feels I was feeling can\u2019t even be explained. I laughed, cried, cheered, screamed, cried some more, smiled, cried a hell of a lot more, and on it goes. I can\u2019t think of any other series that has ended in a way that has had me this satisfied. Everything was addressed. The beauty of it is that there were things set up in the previous books that I didn\u2019t even see coming! I guess this more than makes up for what  Half Wild lacked. If you wrote the series off at that point, pick it back up.  Half Lost has the same excitement that filled the pages of  Half Bad making it unputdownable.Two months have passed since the ending of  Half Wild and Nathan is hell-bent on getting his revenge. The Alliance of Free Witches has suffered a great loss, but is still fighting for the cause they believe in - a world where both the Black and White witches can live together peacefully. The corrupt Council and Hunters are both still trying to end the existence of Black witches, half-codes, the Alliance, and most importantly Nathan. Neither side will back down. Get ready for an intense fight to the end!There are romance developments in this one that explore a ship I\u2019m sure others are both anxious and excited to see. It is done in a beautiful way and don\u2019t want to say anything else about it.The character development over the course of the series was fantastic! From the moment we met some of the characters in the first book (or even the second), with all the things they have gone through- as expected- they\u2019ve grown in more ways than way. I\u2019ve enjoyed this journey with the characters and loved seeing the way everything turned out for them.Aside from the fact that by the end of this book I was surrounded by tissues trying not to destroy the pages I had just read with my tears...this was a GREAT read. The entire series made me feel so many things bringing plenty of twists and surprises along the way. I can\u2019t wait to see what  Sally Green does next!I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review from PenguinTeen."}, {"userName": "Ari", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4813504-ari", "userReview": "[Gabriel dead, Nathan becomes three...The way I see it is it's a happily ever after ending.This fanart describe it best:https://twitter.com/_mitla/status/717...

See how this book was on the shelf need-more-than-my-next-breath! Now see how it's going straight into the trashcan! Also, see how I am tempted to lower the rating to one star!Honestly, I'm not sure whether to even write this review, because it will be next to incomprehensible and not as much a review as a rant about how fucking done I am with this book. Enjoy! (Seriously, this is nothing but an angry rant and sarcasm. Also every second word is fuck, so beware.)The reason I started this trilogy was an amazing post on tumblr telling me about all the diverse characters, canon bi and gay soulmates!, and I definitely can't resist that in an universe with modern day witches.And I loved the first two books! The character development was super well done and I couldn't wait to see how the story ends. Sally's tweets and tumblr posts convinced me we would get a fantastic ending. But ha, how wrong I was. I'm 97% sure she was on drugs writing the last 50 pages.Not only did the ending make 0,001% sense, Green basically punched us all in the face. Diversity? How good is that even if the gay kid gets killed off again and the other one turns into a fucking tree?JFC. Fuck this whole book and everything it stands for.For a moment tonight I thought \"Well, I do understand why she ended it the way she did.\" but fuck no, I do not understand and I refuse to understand why you have to kill off another LGBTQ+ couple / mess their lives up (and fucking turn one into a tree, ha, what a good joke lmao, Sally stop it :'-)) in YA literature.What was the point of this ending? Is there even a fucking point? The only thing I can come up with is that she wanted to show how war can mess someone's life up. But who the fuck here doesn't know how messy war can be? We've read about Nathan's struggle, we saw him getting worse page after page, his emotional state showed us perfectly well how horrible the situation was. Why the fuck was it necessary to kill off the person he loves the most? His fucking soulmate? Hasn't he been through enough already? Nathan deserves so much better.And so fucking does Gabriel. His death didn't make any sense and didn't serve any other purpose than to mess Nathan's life up. So what, this time it isn't the typical 'let's kill this LGBTQ+ character to contribute to the straight character's development' but a 'ha let's kill a gay character to completely ruin the life of a bisexual character, ha, what a great idea'? Dear Sally Green, what the fuck?Nathan survived getting locked up in a fucking cage, was bullied and abused, lost his family and was used as a weapon in a war when he was 17. I repeat, seven-fucking-teen. HE WAS A FUCKING CHILD. So what do we do with him? Kill off the last bit of life-joy he has and turn him into a tree. Bravo! What a twist! I have one last thing to say. Fuck you. Fuck you for killing of another teenager LGBTQ+ couple, we definitely haven't witnessed it enough. .........a motherfucking tree, jfc. what drugs was she on."}, {"userName": "C.G.

THE SECOND MY SHIP SAILED I KNEEEEEEW HE WOULD DIE BECAUSE THIS SERIES IS MERCILESS. And tbh, I've always been able to predict this series because it's really similar to how I write/tell stories (doooon't get me wrong; my writing is watermelon seeds compared to this genius). So I knew that I would let Gabriel die. SO I KNEW IT WOULD HAPPEN HERE AND IT DID. And it was horrifying. And I choked up. Do you realise how often I cry in books? NEVER. AND HERE I AM. A MESSSSSSSSSSSSSS. And then Nathan turned into a tree over his grave. I...I am ridiculously okay with this.I can't BrEATHE.(I'm surprised Nathan/Analisse had a kid though? I honestly can't remember them sleeping together, but I guess the did earlier in the series and I just blocked it haha. #Awkward. Anyway Nathan's kid is Edge and he never met his father. I suppose he could meet a tree but it ain't the same.)And I'm assuming the person who narrates the last chapter is Celia??? Idek why they didn't say her name. THEY COULD'VE SAID HER NAME AND SAVED MY BRAIN TWITCHING.I am a mess. I am a freaking bloody mess right now, I cannot even with this precious book.I loved Gabriel and Nathan so so much.

You can sit there and say, \"Tons of straight people died in this book\" and that's true, yes they did, but (a) killing off all queer characters and/or leaving them to live miserable and alone forever is such an aggressively common trope in media that has significant cultural weight, and (b) scores of straight people (and almost all of them White witches!) went off and lived peacefully and moved on from the war. Meanwhile, exactly 0 queer people had happy endings. You have a gay boy dying in his lover's arms and then a bisexual boy killing himself by turning himself into a tree.I'm not okay with this, and nor am I okay with this book being really flat and lacklustre, filled with battle strategy that I couldn't follow, filled with Nathan fucking hating himself forevermore and never being allowed to heal either from losing Gabriel or from his war trauma or from the abuse he suffered in his teenage. Do not tell me that \"well, it's a war book\" because we've had shitloads of war books that have been painfully, epically sad and horrible and yet have not ended with this ridiculous shock value ending. Why kill Gabriel off? Why leave this protagonist to suffer for years before ultimately ending his own life at the age of twenty-two? If this had been an adult book, it still would have been problematic, but much less so. But you're writing a war book for teens, so don't pretend that there isn't any morality at all between these pages.So what is this book saying? There's no way to recover if you're broken. Forget it. Fuck life. Or, if you're broken and straight, you might be all right, but if you're broken and queer, you can FORGET ever being happy again. But the thing is that I didn't sign on for that shitty pointless soapbox finale, and neither did I sign on to consume another piece of media that ends with more sad, dead queer people. I'm fucking sick of it and when I cried at the end of this, they weren't, \"Oh, I'm so sad but enjoying this\" tears, they were \"I'm so sad and furious and there is no hope here, there is nothing but hatred, nothing to take away from it, nothing at all\". Van's death adds to this in that she was coded as gender non-conforming and yeah, of course, she died too. \"Yeah, but it's war\". Yeah, but you sent boatloads of cis, hetero characters off to live in peace while the only queer characters died. \"Yeah, but that's war\". Yeah, but finding a decent well-written fantasy book with queer protagonists has 1000-1 odds. Finding a decent well-written fantasy book with ANY queer characters is pretty rare in itself, so when you then kill off all of those queer characters, who's fucking left? \"Yeah but it's a war book.\" Yeah, but this is a fictional account of it. You have control over it, and symbolism is something that you create. There is no symbolism in the real world, but novels are full of it. It's the whole point of them. Look at the Daughter of Smoke and Bone series: heartbreaking. Absolutely devastatingly sad. But it didn't rely on killing off the only marginalized characters for shock value. In fact, almost all of the main characters survived. Did that make it less shocking? No. Did that make it less sad? No. Look at The Hunger Games: the representation of queer people was non-existent, but then again, there was precious little time for anything but straightforward plot. And it was also devastatingly sad, so honest and open and frank about the cost of war, and yet our protagonists didn't end up slumping down and giving up. They were not destroyed by their trauma.What do we look for in war novels? Do we look for messages of bloodshed, of violence, of the awful darkness in humanity? Why do we look for that? What's the point in reading war novels just to revel in how fucking dreadful people can be to each other? A war novel that champions hope in the face of incredible adversity, that reminds us of the good that people can do even when they'd been compelled to do bad, and that speaks of the light at the end of the tunnel, is infinitely more compelling than a war book that throws its characters into a meat grinder and then does nothing with it. I'm not asking for a book about how everything always works out fine after a war, essentially preaching that war is necessary, no - I'm looking for a book like Daughter of Smoke and Bone that rejects war completely, that presents peace as always being the better option, that speaks of the total senselessness that is organized violence. Karou said to her people, \"What do you see in our future?\" and that is what makes that series so brilliant in the way that it handles war. It doesn't ask whether or not war is necessary, and it doesn't scream \"Yeah, I'm super gritty\" and it doesn't annihilate its only marginalized characters just to show off how Super Dark it is. It rejects the idea of war altogether and illustrates how absolutely pointless it is.I loved the first two books in this series, because it seemed like this was the direction they were going. Waking up to how peace is the only way to move forward. The characters felt so real to me, and Nathan's voice was so strong, and I was so connected to it. But this brilliant protagonist who had survived being locked in a cage, mutilated, emotionally and physically abused, and ostracized by society was reduced to sad, just sad in Half Lost. I'm just so angry about this. And it's not even all about the Kill Your Gays trope. It's about the waffling storyline, the confusing action, the total lack of a satisfying ending. There's about half a sentence of resolution for every major character we've been following over the course of the series and I actually could not believe that it cut off where it did: unresolved, unfinished, absurdly depressing and mopey.I'm still crying about this but they aren't cute tears. They're fucking irritated tears.

Such a tragic love storyAlways so hopeless.When they finally got together&dared to have one simple dream it was snatched away too. But at least both were free of cruelty & together in tragic peace at the end.Proof for Gabriel's & Nathan's undying love for each other. Like the ring, forever.Their love was so real&mature,actions not just words,love not just empty lust.Respect,loyalty and devotion.Tragic war kids with one simple dream they shared,hold onto to survive,brutally snatched away last second,when it was over.That's why both didn't make it.I wanted all whites to pay. Kill them all like Marcus said. They were dicks. But in the end most got away with everything after making blacks' lives hell for years,even at the camp treating like tools and using slurs to describe them. Nat who suffered so much because of them was threatened with cage, she never paid for torturing&keeping him there. Anna ruined everything and sickeningly simply excused herself, got happiest ending. Gab who was so good&never harmed, loved, and stayed for Nat got killed. Nat suffered,lost everything and not all paid. After he lost Gab he did not even have strength for revenge anymore.Poor boys.I hated people always controlling Nat... with humiliation,pain,potions...forgetting what he went through,threatening for actions yet nobody else was&no one was paying for his pain.Hated the \"equality\" scene,glad he went against it,but at the end ended up so broken he didnt even care anymore.Where was fairness? Nat&Gab deserved happiness after everything,not the dicks&cowards,those who ran away,hurt,we barely knew.Bullshit not equality&justice.Im mad that Nat who didnt really have a choice, & Gab who stayed for him even though he wanted to leave,both who suffered&sacrificed so much,worked so hard for their dream,happy ending,to live together peacefully after war, never got it & nobody paid for their suffering.Fought for the better future when they could just left. While Anna who done no good, worked against them, hurt Nathan, let her brothers torture him, murdered his father who could possibly have saved Gab, never worked for happiness, EXCUSED herself, got the happiest ending imaginable and others, just not Nat, forgave her.WTF? Yet so expected:She never cared so just moved on.Im mad Sally let her live and killed Gab.Nat&Gab lost everything so people who did nothing/harmed could have it better?SickWhy Gab out of everybody? To take the last hope away.I cant get the choice to make precious Gabby die in agony & let her happily live. Makes me ill. Gabby deserved to live, not her. She got away with everything as he died for loving. Her ignorance and hate saved her, his sacrifice & love for Nat killed him. Why he paid for loving?Such a stab.And with that Nat's last sanity, Gab his dream, gone. \"Lucky\" lived to see Wales unlike him, but...Only the thought of him saved him at the council but then he pretty much died with him. The fact that he waited to change into a tree proved he wanted to do it forever, not change first thing out of desperation to come back when healed. I loved Nat's reaction to Gab's death. This is how it was meant to be esp as Gab would't have died if not him. He knew Gab only stayed because he loved him. & died. The guilt&sacrifice&love were real.Gab died, knowing their dream wont ever come true, there will be no Wales, he won't ever see them, be with Nat after everything was finally starting to seem possible. He was so happy... & deserved it so much for everything he did. It was heartbreaking.I don't get hurting those who fought and gifting those who did not or worse.Im grateful that if Gab had to die then Nat's reaction was the one written beginning when he was looking for him. Gab was everything to him and that's it.But he & Gab deserved their happy ending.Nat knew he & Gab'd had more time before, Gab'd have survived & they'd have been happy after war if not Nat, if he listened to Gab. Killed her, didn't waste TIME with/for her hurting&using him to save her. Left the war:Marc&Gab would have survived. They both were in it only for Nat. Saving Anna killed Mar&Gab. Sparing his sister killed Gab. Taking Amulet saved Nat but killed Gab in result. Gab was completely sacrificed. If they just left the war like Gab wanted to...I think that was part of why Nat completely broke. Gab&Marc sacrificed themselves for him out of love & died because of his choices. She who only hurt him survived. Heartbreaking. But he fulfilled his promise & then went after Gab & that made it bearable.I hope it was Nat's bad dream/vision again. Gab just woke him up & they went for a walk & swim in Wales where they live as planned in peace&love. & they spend time by the fire, Nat watching happy Gabby like he wanted,both watch the gorgeous view,love,don't starve anymore,&laugh,swim,hike,sunshine on their pretty now healthy faces,&then travel too, &are just so happy in love together both living their dream... Like they dreamed. Love only growing stronger.I loved Gab not letting Nat treat him bad,Nat feeling bad \"how could I?I dont want to ever hurt him again\",hating that Gab thought he doesn't care,apologising&working for forgiveness.The ring scene!Finally.They only had one dream. They were each other's dream.I'm so heartbroken and emotionally drained.Glad Nat was too. But I just can't accept that the sunshine of the story is dead. It's not how it was meant to end. Poor war kid, he just wanted to live in peace. He was so sacrificing,pretty&cheerful&good,loved but stood his ground,wanted to live,be with Nat with who he just&finally pretty much married,go Wales like promised,leave the war tired of suffering,scared of them dying,but ended up staying out of love &dying in agony for Nat who survived. Never lived to see Wales,be happy.Only his body was taken there.Just when they thought it was over...A second of relief.Fusing.Happiness snatched away suddenly,poor Gabby trying to hold on,Nat scared,desperate holding his hands,him,begging,screaming,kissing,hugging,loving... \"you won't die\" \"dont leave me\":( both suffered got ruined completelyI was happy that Nat never got over it, it was too much&he followed him.They deserved happiness the most after only suffering so hopeless. They were teased, the visions, hopes, promises... They repeated&promised each other that they will have their sweet ending together.Be there for each other.They finally got together!Truly believed in it.Dreamed about it,clung to it.Worked for it.Just one dream they shared. I wanted them to finally be happy&peaceful together.But they were the ones who never got their happiness.Yet others did.I didnt like it\"Wounded, not lost\"They were just boys.& the war took away everything from them. Why? Didnt they suffer enough?Gab did want to leave the war which would have saved his life. If he only did,he could had an ending like Nesbitt... He could have been happy. But he stayed for Nat, trusting in their innocent dream.Nat's reaction to his death was perfect. I would not be satisfied if he moved on after Gab sacrificed himself,died for him.They gave their lives to each other.They were both invited to Nes's wedding, Gab was meant to take care of Nat... but he was gone by then.& obviously Nat didn't go without him. I liked that.Gab was so good & innocent for the war, he was this little, happy, loving Nat sunshine, speaking french sensitive angel to me, which makes the whole ending even worse. For Nathan, who suffered more than enough, too.Because it could have been different if they left like Gabby wanted to. I think that was what broke Nat too. He knew Gab wanted to leave tired of everything, of being hungry (Nat's worry over his thinness!)etc... but stayed for him.Nat proved he loves Gab just as much as he loved him. Beyond anythingIf anybody deserved a happy ending it was them. His death was only accepted by me because the other suffered so much because of it.But it still hurt. Esp since people like Anna survived happy but Gab did not. Why! Frustrating, feels like a stab. So unfair. At least this wasn't done to have Nat pushed into her arms (Id be raging then). Nathan stayed with the one he loved and it saved the situation.And maybe the fact that she lived and had a child but Nat still chose to stay with Gab said it all.Still unfair. And the child made it worse. Why she who done so much WRONG and excused herself like it was nothing got it ALL and the main boys got screwed after doing everything right? Gabriel/Nathan relationship is the most beautiful one I have ever read.[I hated, it was so wrong but at least luckily didnt go where I feared - The pregnancy was a stab /it would break Gab's heart/ & I hated it. She didnt deserve to have a child of a boy she ruined. Poor kid. Gab died for Nat while someone like her,selfish who only harmed,survived and got all the happiness&Nat's child.Wedding with a dude,people forgetting what she did. They wanted to go to her wedding?! Nat never forgave.Just him thinking for a sec about what he wanted with her once made me cringe terrified he'd go back.Wtf someone broke you two,Nat?She did!Why was she mentioned at all!Why always excused!She ruined everything!The only good thing that came out of it was that Nat finally could see that Gab was the one who really loved him and he loved him back.That was REAL, not him&her.Wish Nat realised that instead of saying bullshit.Once he was Gab's he was his forever&beyond.I did like Nat saying how she will have to live knowing what she did.Killing Gab, he dies in agony&let her live happy?! Brothers tortured Nat because of her. Marcus died because of her. Gab possibly wouldn't have died if not her. And yet she just excused herself and got happiest ending. Gabriel who never harmed,protected&gave his life to Nat... Lost it. She never done a good thing for Nat.SHE WAS MEANT TO PAY NOT BE EXCUSEDAlso others trying to push him to HER & the kid!? After what she did! Knowing about Gabriel! Way to piss on his sacrifice, sick.Trying to make Nat forget?! Wtf? Shoo!But he still NEVER did and it said it all[Arran's sudden cold behaviour about Gab at the end really put me off & Ledger could piss off, just wanting Nat for himself]Gab only had Nat & Nat only had him. Leave them alone.If Ann'd be the one who would \"heal\" him I'd rage for years and never get over it. It was enough she got an undeserved happy ending unlike the boys. Thank god Gab did not die just so Nat would be pushed into her arms. It would be the worst. It is enough he died while she lived But Nat stayed by him even then.Gabriel was never betrayed again]Nat&Gab suffered so much that they deserved their sweet ending. They had their dream, loved each other, just needed time to be given to them.Everything that could have been...And Gab wanted to leave the war, so if they did... If the amulet protected him too... Nathan knew Gab was there for him and died. I'd break knowing, too.Gab loved Nat beyond anything and it killed him. Biggest sacrifice. But seeing Nathan joining him instead of moving on made it bearable. I wouldnt accept it any other way.When I've read about the child I just begged please don't do it to Gab, don't go back to her... But he did notIt would be a stab in the back after Gab sacrificed himself for himOnce Nat realised how much he loves Gab, he was his, loyal&devoted till the end&beyond. Nat's reactions&thoughts,the moment they became a couple, their love for the things they did together, Nat apologising,the ring,their loving, dream to be together happy&peaceful in Wales, which they both clung to desperately and believed in, & how he reacted to Gab dying in agony in his arms...[the war was so close to be over!] [I'm grateful Nat was there for him. His desperation, begging him to stay, and promising him he won't die but he could do nothing as much as he tried... kisses, hugs],remembering memories, his touch&smile, everything even the way Gab looked at him & not wanting to forget so badly, trying to feel&see him again, to how he never recovered&just kept on thinking about him, seeing how it was meant to be if only he did not die(so heartbreaking), broken believing Gab was there with him in Wales needing to see Gab finally peaceful&happy,with him&seeing&feeling Wales as promised by Nat, not dead before it happened & would have happened if they only left like Gab wanted to,and even when denial was over he still did not move on, no denial but neither acceptance. The agony&depression&devastation,full of love thoughts, missing him, the fact he took him to Wales as he promised, staying by his grave, just the two of them, how his death had an effect on his mentality[!] the way he didnt want to acknowledge the tragedy, he refused&became mentally ill,broke,&still saw him all the time just wanting to see him happy with him... Like they were meant to be. Nat, the one who was full of rage, just broke when he lost Gab. He loved him beyond anything and it wasn't just words, it was real and it was proved. Just like Gab's love for him when he fought for his heart, stayed and risked his life, died for Nat.Nat gave him his life too.Nat couldn't heal & Im glad. Its realistic&says all,moving on would be a stab.Nat's kept his promise,took him to Wales&stayed there with him like they were meant to be together... Even if he could only take his body. But he did. And lived there by his grave, when the grass grew over it, never wanting to leave, no matter how much others tried. (They pissed me off. Leave them alone! Boys only had each other) And did not let others pull him away from him. He just found a way to be with him again forever.Securing him.There, where promised, till the end, beyond it. That it happened after a few years, made the love even more real, because you knew he did not do it out of simple desperation right after his death[he chose to grieve first as unbearable as it was], so you'd think he would come back after he would feel better, but no, he said he will wait, and he did it after he calmed a little, but never got over it, he healed enough to not be in denial anymore, to not have them give him potions, but he never accepted it, the agony was still there,he thought everything through with Gab never stopping being his priority,only love,he practiced,thought that through earth they became one when they were looking for the gift so it would be the same when he would change, and how Gab would love to have a tree by him... And Nat did it. Gave him more than a tree. Himself. Basically found a way to hold his hands again. After a few years he still only wanted him.Still most important.Nat's love for Gab won & he joined him just as he planned in the very beginning. From the moment he realised his love, it only grew stronger&nothing managed to break it. After a few years he did it as planned and that's how we know it was forever, not temporary. It was beautiful. Gab dying&Nat never moving on but finding a way to be with him again was a happy ending in its own way. It was about their unconditional true love at the end, death could not change it, love Nat luckily returned, late but not too late. At least they could spend some time together before everything went to hell. Gab knew Nat loved him, he proved plenty, I'd hate if he died not knowing. Nat moving on, leaving, wouldn't be a happy ending to me. Because he would break the promise and leave when Gabriel never did. Besides I really believe he could not realistically heal. The tree full of bruises said it all. He lost too much. Gab was the last person who held him sane. Was always meant to. And then was taken away from him too. [Nat desperately holding, hugging his dead body. Gosh... I can't believe he died.] When everything started falling into place... They were making plans for the future... And I appreciate he wasn't \"exchanged\" for someone else. It'd be sick.They found their \"peace\" together,even if in the most tragic way. Exactly where they wanted to be,Nat found a way to be with his soulmate against all, ignoring others telling him to accept and move on. Gab would not leave either.Nat screamed love since he realised he really feels it for Gab. He wanted to apologise for everything [Love that Gab stood his ground and did not let Nat treat him badly] and make up for it, bringing Gabby to tears. When he gave him the ring... Sincere thoughts&worry for him were precious. And after everything he mentally broke&never gave up but finally found his way to him. Their relationship wasn't based on lust but love in the first place (that's why it won over the emptiness that was A/N).The innocent precious love they had for each other made the ending even more heartbreaking.They suffered enough but it never got better for them, only worse.I was terrified of Nat moving on with Anna, it would be the biggest stab in the back especially after Gab died for him. He wanted to leave but stayed for him. And died killed by his sister.Or even with the other magician... It just wouldn't feel right. This one just wanted him for himself. Gab & Nat were meant to be together in Wales. That was the plan, the promise - Nat kept it. Others trying to change his mind made me want to shoo them away. Nat was the only one who truly cared about Gab, the only family. The ring... it was practically engagement and when he said Gab will keep it forever... It was a promise, engagement,marriage-it was important. He promised him Wales and he took him there and stayed with him forever even after death. He fulfilled his promise even though Gab never lived to see Wales with his own eyes. And just being there wasn't enough, he found a way to basically hold his hands again.I am happy that if one had to die, the other kind of did too, wanted to be with him,found a way. It was all beautiful in its cruel way. More if they both just died. Because they proved their unconditional love for each other.I would prefer if they fulfilled their dreams, they would be in Wales happy & alive just like they were meant to be, just like Nat could not stop seeing it, like they deserved & clung to the dream, and I wanted to be in denial too, but if I could not have them alive... at least it were Wales, because Nathan promised him Wales, and they stayed together, just as he promised him too. Against others trying to make him move on. Nathan never left Gabriel, he found a way to be with him forever even after his death.Their love was beautiful. \"wounded, not lost\" Nat's last words, their password, showing how he never forgot and never managed to get over Gab's death because it was too much&he loved him beyond anything. He finally found a way to be with Gab again. The whole idea of him staying with him even after death... keeping him safe, never wanting to leave, was so touching. Finding a way to hold his hands again. So right.Poor kids :( They were tragic war kids who deserved so much better. Hurts that those undeserved did instead.Remember when they've met? :( Their love won with everything, even with death at the end, but it was too short when they were alive. I wish Anna was never in the way, that she died not Gab, that Nat wouldn't have wasted time when they were still alive. I wish he left with Gab when there was still time. He never forgot himself for not doing it and saving him, them, in result.For a moment I thought they saved Gab. Like Nat, living in denial too, but his reaction to his death was 'perfect'. It showed how much it broke him so how much he loved him. They deserved happiness beyond anything,not to be broken completely after everything they went through. Together happy in Wales, finally the kids they were meant to be, keeping each other safe.ALIVE.They repeated so many times how much they wanted it. I just wish the ending said \"i read to them\""}, {"userName": "venus", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22459698-venus", "userReview": "Lmao, Green sure had fun jerking us around.

Maybe some day I'll write a proper review.

This is the series that got me into YA literature. It was never perfect, but it was interesting and different.Instead book three comes out and everything crashes and burns. The plot loses itself (what the hell is blue? Why was it introduced so late?) the characters we\u2019ve become invested in disappear or die (Arran is barely in this book and Van gets only about a chapter of mourning after her death \u2013 and Ellen? She dies off-screen and we get a single passing mention?) and the ending, is, quite bluntly, a fucking disaster. Honestly, I have read messages in my alphabet soup that spelt out more compelling stories than Sally Green writes.But let\u2019s put aside plot talk \u2013 because I\u2019m not even gonna pretend to understand that trainwreck \u2013 and get to the crux of the matter here.In her infinite wisdom, after months and months of baiting the fans and pages and pages of promising a happy ending, she slaughters her lead characters. Let me repeat that for those of you who don\u2019t understand. She shoots Gabriel, a canonically gay character, at the very last minute so Nathan, her bisexual lead character and Gabriel\u2019s lover, can watch him die in his arms. The bloodbath doesn\u2019t end there though \u2013 because now that Gabriel\u2019s gone Nathan lives a few years of intense, traumatized misery (you could say he goes back to his roots I guess) and then he \u2013\nTurns into a motherfucking tree. \nOh yes. Yes he does. He becomes a fucking tree. All so he \u201cbe one with nature\u201d and \u201cwatch over Gabriel for eternity\u201d or some other bullshit. Let me say, by the way, Nathan\u2019s ability to turn into anything but animals was not brought up in the entire of the series until this super convenient moment.I just. I can\u2019t with this. Why? At what point did Sally Green think this would make sense, narratively speaking??But, as gay girl always looking for some representation, I was ecstatic when I found these books. These are books in which the main character is openly bisexual, has a gay love interest and yet the story is very much not about that \u2013 it\u2019s everything I wanted.And the way Sally posited about on social media, the promise of a future she sowed into her books, I was so sure that for once, just for once, these gay teenagers would get their happily ever after \u2013 that for once I would not have to consume another piece of media where me and others like me got slaughtered by a straight writer for the angst of it all. And then she did it. She did it good.I spit on this series now. I loved it so much, I promoted it to all the people I knew, many of whom were gay themselves, I was so excited \u2013 I talked with her about it, other people I know talked to her about it, we told her how happy we were to have this sort of representation, and she smiled and lied to her faces knowing all the while what she was going to do.So Sally Green, fuck you and fuck your supreme addition to the every growing \u201cbury your gays\u201d trope and I hope you cop the social media backlash you deserve for this."}, {"userName": "Sarah Churchill", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18321322-sarah-churchill", "userReview": "Possibly my favourite ending of any book, ever.So many feels.

Puede ser, sin duda, pero voy a tratar de justificar mi opini\u00f3n en unas cuantas l\u00edneas.Empezando por los personajes, creo que se llevan la palma de esta saga. Nathan evoluciona de un modo tan extra\u00f1o, tan incre\u00edble y tan cruel a la vez que es un placer leer sobre \u00e9l p\u00e1ginas y p\u00e1ginas. Gabriel, por otro lado, consigue que el lado perdido de la mente de Nathan no est\u00e9 tan perdida: es su gu\u00eda, su fiel acompa\u00f1ante. Una relaci\u00f3n que ha sido sin lugar a dudas lo mejor de la novela e incluso podr\u00eda decir de la saga (en cuanto a personajes, por supuesto). Y ES QUE ENCIMA PASAN UNAS COSAS QUE OMG. Los secundarios no me han cuajado del todo...De Sally Green no puedo decir nada que no haya dicho ya. Toda una se\u00f1ora escritora de los pies a la cabeza. Lo que hace esta mujer es algo incre\u00edble, aunque s\u00ed es cierto que he echado de menos un poco m\u00e1s de sorpresa en su estilo. Sin embargo, creo que se ha centrado m\u00e1s en el desarrollo de los personajes y en sus sentimientos... Pero aun y todo lo he echado de menos, jo.La historia en s\u00ed es lo que m\u00e1s me ha fallado. En El lado oscuro no paraban de ocurrir cosas y hab\u00eda no solo giros en la trama, sino personajes interesantes que aparec\u00edan continuamente para aderezar la trama. En El lado salvaje estas mismas caracter\u00edsticas se multiplicaron y consiguieron crear una novela que es una OBRA DE ARTE. En El lado perdido he tenido la sensaci\u00f3n de estar esperando algo que al final no ha resultado ser lo que promet\u00eda: una guerra capaz de superarlo todo, que se lleva fraguando tanto tiempo... Y que resulta tener un desenlace algo pobre y en pocas p\u00e1ginas. No s\u00e9, me ha parecido desproporcionado que la mayor\u00eda de la novela se base en preparar la guerra y que finalice tan abruptamente.En cuanto al final en s\u00ed de la trilog\u00eda, en cuanto al broche de oro, he de decir que me lo tem\u00eda. S\u00ed, s\u00ed, me lo llevaba viendo ya unas cuantas p\u00e1ginas. De hecho, me inclinaba por ese final desde las primeras p\u00e1ginas. Quiz\u00e1 es porque yo cuando escribo siempre opto por lo peor y lo m\u00e1s horrible, y Sally Green parece que tambi\u00e9n, as\u00ed que me inclin\u00e9 a pensar eso... y result\u00f3 ser. No s\u00e9, el final me ha dejado algo chafado. No me ha pillado por sorpresa.En l\u00edneas generales, El lado perdido es un final de trilog\u00eda que no est\u00e1 a la altura de la segunda parte, pero s\u00ed de la primera. Creo que es una de las mejores trilog\u00edas actuales y no parar\u00e9 de recomendarla por sus personajes, historia y su estilo tan \u00fanico.

The war is killing you.\u201d\nThis trilogy should have been a standalone. Or a duology.Firstly, I need to establish - I LOVED the first book. I thought Half Bad was awesome and atmospheric and gritty. The sequel was pretty good too, though in my opinion this trilogy peaked at the end of the first book.I hated Half Lost. Everything I loved from the previous books was gone and it had everything that annoyed me - boring writing, a plot that went nowhere, clich\u00e9s, and irritating characters. The main problem I had, though, was with the main character.This was pretty much Nathan's train of thought for the entire book:\n\u201cLater I remember what I could do. It\u2019s easy. I could kill them all.\u201d\nWhat I loved about Nathan in the first book was the dark sadness that surrounded him - he was a half Black, half White Witch and an outcast. He was excluded and beaten for no reason other than his lineage. But in this book he lost all of that and was consumed by a single thought: KILL KILL KILL.The first 250 pages (out of a 350-page novel) were building up for the ending. And when it finally came, it was just a series of quick action scenes and pointless violence.Also, I thought it was really cheesy how Nathan practically became invincible. With all of his new, special Gifts he was pretty much immortal. So when he ran into battle - the \"climax\" of this book - I was stifling a yawn. Like, I know those guys he's fighting can't touch him, so I'm bored.Nathan's hatred-filled narration was exhausting. Within the first thirty pages, I was done listening to him yammer on and on about Annalise and the Alliance and his father.

I cannot believe that Sally used social media, made it very clear that she was marketing this book to young, Lgbt+ teens, and then she goes and kills of the two lgbt+ protagonists, whilst the minor straight (white, able bodied, neurotypical) characters carry on and live a fulfilling lifeThe deaths don't even serve any purpose, they didn't further the plot at all. The war was won. It's pure wangst. To make the characters suffer. To have another tragic story that's been done a thousand times before.And of course everybody's telling us to shut up - people kill their characters all the time! It's dramatic, gritty realism! Stop whining about your precious Gay Characters dying.Listen. For every one tragic story with a straight romance/character that ends in tragedy there are a hundred ones with happy endings. Plenty of representation. You can find another. They are everywhere.Lgbt+ teens don't have that luxury. What little representation either ends in tragedy, or ends in heartbreak. They can't pick up another book and find their happy ending. All you're doing is depriving 15, 16 year olds - scratch that, 14 year olds, 12 year olds, - of their much needed representation. The media doesn't cater to them. And you can't taunt them with happy endings, with characters they can relate to, and then just ruin it all.Do you know what message that's sending to these kids? The group of people most likely to commit suicide?
