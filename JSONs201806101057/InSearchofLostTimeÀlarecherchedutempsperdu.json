I mean, can I? Nope. I can't! After all, this house is where I read Proust -- wait, I read Swann's Way before I moved here, which is pretty nuts to think about -- and so how can I move without reviewing the whole thing?I do feel pretty traumatized after finishing this book. Sort of shellshocked and confused with all these half-formed thoughts and intense inexplicable feelings bouncing around in me, and I don't know what to do with them or myself. Yesterday I wound up sitting in my friend's bar explaining Proust's aesthetic theories, but that kind of behavior'll get you kicked out of most places, and is not really becoming a young lady. And obviously that's where this website comes in.... what is it for, if not to unload just this kind of mental baggage?Reading Proust made me wish I were more of a scholar, so I could try to puzzle out some kind of literary context for what this book is. I feel like people think of Proust as being stuffy and old-fashioned and all crusty and ancient, but I think a lot of that has to do with the subject matter (a lost time with superficial resemblance to Jane Austen's milieu), so it's kind of shocking to remember what else was going on while he was writing this. I know this is dumb and there're much better comparisons, but I kept thinking while reading this that it was like thinking your whole life that New York punk in the seventies was all about the Ramones and imagining you really got what was going on then from just listening to that.... but then when you're in your mid-twenties someone suddenly plays you Television for the first time, and you're like what? Like you think you know what modernism is, it's like Ulysses or whatever, but then you find out it's got this completely insane cousin across the river who's just doing all these things that appear at first to have no relationship at all to everything you ignorantly thought you kind of understood at least a little bit before. Again, I'm not much of a scholar and what I'm saying probably doesn't make any sense. To be honest, I don't even know what \"modernism\" means, I just know it sounds literary.... I think what I'm trying to get at is that the relevance of Proust's concerns to his time aren't immediately obvious because his approach to them initially seems so weird and unfamiliar. But then you realize, while you're in it, that Proust is actually so much of his time it's incredible, and that what he's saying and doing was hugely innovative and exciting at the beginning of the last century, and actually, I'd say, remains as much so today. And I just kind of wish that I knew more about art and literature and whatnot so I could tie it all in better, since I sense there're all these fascinating connections and reference points, but I don't know what they are. I'd sort of like to sneak into some college class or something where they're reading Proust, and listen in, or at least steal their syllabus.... do they even read Proust in college? I feel like they don't. I mean, I never heard of him when I was in college, or after. I really hadn't. I honestly had no idea who Proust was until I started hanging out on this website.Anyway, for me the most relevant contemporary writer I thought of while reading this wasn't a novelist. A little background: I always really loathed the discipline of psychology and thought it was stupid. When I unwittingly enrolled in social work school, I was dismayed to discover that getting my MSW involved reading pages and pages of precisely this stuff I'd always looked down on.... My happy discovery was that Freud, at least, was actually a fabulous writer, and a lot of his ideas are totally fascinating and very beautiful. What I realized finally is that I just resented psychology for its pretension of pretending it's a science. But actually psychology's concerns and sometimes even their expression are hugely significant -- among the most significant -- and kind of wonderful. In fact, I decided, I love psychology, as long as it knows its place and realizes it's an art, not a science.... Freud said he wanted his case histories to read like short stories, so I think he understood this. Proust, of course, took this to an extreme, by exploring essentially the same territory, not in a short story, but in an extraordinarily long and in some ways kind of ridiculous novel. In Search of Lost Time is about the development of the mind, the experience of consciousness, the influence of past events and relationships on one's emotions and behavior.... all the same stuff Freud cared about, only it made more sense to me here, presented this way.I completely lost my shit reading the last couple pages of this book, and broke down on some fundamental level in a way I imagine was akin to what you can get from really top-shelf psychotherapy. Towards the end of the book, Proust explains everything he's been trying to do, and just did, in writing this novel. It's his theory of art and specifically of literature, and it's pretty hard to argue with since you've watched him just do it. One of the things that Proust says is that readers of his book \"would not be my readers but readers of themselves, my book serving merely as a sort of magnifying glass, such as the optician of Combray used to offer to a customer, so that through my book I would give them the means of reading in their own selves\" (p. 384). I guess that could sound unexciting, ripped out of context, but he really does do this, and it truly is astounding. I felt throughly convinced by Proust's theory of what art is for, and as far as I'm concerned he was totally successful in accomplishing his aims. Like psychotherapy, ISoLT attempts to dive into the murk of the unconscious past to retrieve experiences and cognitions that have become inaccessible. Proust dives in and swims down to the bottom, and he finds them, and he grabs them, and he brings them back up and then hands them to you.... Which is pretty nuts. I mean, it's intense. I feel fucked up from it.Hm. I thought I wanted to talk about this book, but maybe I just want to pack up my shit after all. I really do want to review this book, but maybe it's too soon? It's a really insane novel, and there's tons of stuff in it I'd really love to dork out about on here.... but yeah, maybe too soon. I might come back and say something more coherent later on, when it's all settled down a bit.I guess the only thing I need to add right at this moment is that I really felt like Proust gave me this particular combination of the things I need most. I really can't read anything too difficult or serious, and to anyone who's considering giving Proust a try -- I can't emphasize this enough -- forget what you heard: this book is anything but a ponderous drag. It's silly and hilarious and smart and bizarre, and there's tons of fashion and sex and depravity and satire and insane plot twists that don't make any sense. I personally have a very short attention span and I cannot and do not read anything that isn't vastly entertaining. In Search of Lost Time is VASTLY ENTERTAINING!! (Except for The Captive, which is only somewhat entertaining.) This is not to say that it's for everyone, and I can see how lots of people would totally hate this. HOWEVER: it's definitely worth a shot, because this book could change your life. I mean that. It could. I'm a completely different person now than I was when I started. So what if this means I'm now an obsessively jealous, elitist, antisemitic, agoraphobic pervert who speaks exclusively in run-on sentences? I think I'm better for it, and you might be too."}, {"userName": "Ben", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4249546-ben", "userReview": "Why did Proust have to write a 4000 page novel, especially when there is not any discernable, coherent plot? Was it really necessary to have those extended society scenes, some of which lasted for 150 pages or so? Couldn\u2019t the whole thing have been tightened up a little and cut down to 1000 pages or so? I asked myself these questions at various points over the nine months it took me to journey through Proust\u2019s masterpiece. It was not until the final two volumes (and particularly the latter half of Time Regained) that it all started to make sense. The point Proust is trying to make can only be experienced (as opposed to realized intellectually) if you have plodded through the seemingly endless series of anecdotes, asides and philosophical musings. Proust is trying to tell us how the experiences of our past slip away from our memory and, as such, no longer have any obvious impact on us. In some cases, (i.e. sexual jealousy and grief), this is a good thing, lest the pain of these losses would forever burden us. But it also isolates us from those moments of pleasure, of experiencing pure beauty. We can try, through the vehicle of voluntary memory to retrieve \u201cthe good old days\u201d but we will get nothing more than a snapshot, and will not feel the experience of what it was really like in those moments. The only way to recapture lost time, Proust tells us, is through the involuntary memories that spontaneously arise from random sensory input (the taste of a madeleine soaked in tea, the experience of standing on uneven paving stones, the clang of a spoon against a dish) as it triggers the memories of the last time we experienced the same sensations along with the other physical and emotional sensations with which the catalytic sensation is associated. The experience of these sensations is actually of a purer form than we experienced when they happened to us the first time, because they are not impeded by all the other competing stimuli that were impinging on us at the time. At the time, for example, we may have been disappointed that this resort was not exactly what we had in mind, we may have been worried about the health of a loved one, we might be distracted by concerns of our professional careers. In this moment of recapturing the past, all that comes to us is the unadulterated form of the experience of pleasure. Of course, this is a pretty unreliable mechanism to tap into our past and, as Proust shows, it is fleeting as well. The only way to recapture the past in a lasting way is through the creation of a work of art: which is where the book comes in. How does a writer depict an experience which is eventually forgotten, and is then perfectly recaptured years later? Well, you have to help the reader have the experience of long stretches of time, of the entirety of a long life lived, complete with all the hundreds of people and experiences and moments of inspiration and self-doubt that come with it. When, in the last pages of Time Regained, Proust describes the incident of the \u201cgood night kiss\u201d (one of the earliest episodes of the book), I felt like this did occur 40 years ago, given how long ago I read it. And, as Proust, through his magnificent prose lovingly reconstructed the scene, it came back to me with the full force of his original description. He had succeeded in helping me recapture this literary event, and how beautiful the experience of it was! I certainly don\u2019t want to try to compete with the length of In Search of Lost Time itself with this review, so let me conclude quickly. Please, if you have any interest at all in serious literature, do not be thrown off by the length of this book. It is an unparalleled work of genius for which, as I hope I have argued successfully above, the length is an essential element. If you make the commitment, you will be rewarded."}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": "[1.

The lives that you admire, the attitudes that seem noble to you, have not been shaped by a paterfamilias or a schoolmaster, they have sprung from very different beginnings, having been influenced by evil or commonplace that prevailed round them. They represent a struggle and a victory.\u201d Proust is a great teacher. This may sound embarrassingly platitudinous, and yet I find that it is a fact altogether too easily overlooked in our incessant praise (or bemoaning) of his technical achievements as a stylistic innovator. Setting aside for a while the whole issue of innovative narrative technique (which is nonetheless essential to the realization of his thought through literary art), we can appreciate that he has something important to teach us about what it means to be wise, or, in short, a more fully realized human being. He does so by bodying forth through narrative a model (I'd even say, a paradigm) of the process of self-knowledge. In so doing, he becomes an indispensable companion to our own most personal and intimate developmental struggle to compass the manifold, disjointed flux of experience into a coherent, meaningful whole that we can point to as \u201cour self.\u201d As psychologists now recognize, a series of narrative acts (or \u201cacts of meaning,\u201d as Jerome Bruner put it) weave together, one by one, the fabric of our identity. What we are fundamentally is a narrative identity, a carefully demarcated world of meaning to which we cling in the face of the flux (notice Proust's recurring focus of description: thresholds and borders, doorways and windows, walls and fences). The slow construction of this most fundamental narrative unity that constitutes the real ground of our most mundane awareness is Proust's chosen theme. This fundamental understanding of the self-making self is, paradoxically, the culmination of the pursuit of self-knowledge. And in this, Proust puts his finger on the very pulse of what identity means and can mean in our historical epoch. As Charles Taylor points out in Sources of the Self, the fundamental understanding of an ineradicable and refractory (to the theoretical understanding and its search for pure transparency) poietic element that lies at the heart of all our acts of knowing is foundational for modern thought in general. In short, we make the self we strive to know, necessarily. Deliberations about meanings to entertain and construct form the very ground we stand on in our attempts to reflect and to know Self. In this, Proust's narrative art implicitly critiques the foundational move of Western philosophy and intellectual history alike: namely, Plato's separation between narrative and knowledge, theoria and poiesis, art and philosophy. Proust seems to say that theoria is poietic, and poiesis is theoretical, and reminds us the more primal etymological sense of narrative (gno \u2013 to know). In this, he elevates the modern novel to the status of a privileged epistemic instrument and redefines the aim of wisdom. The artist stakes out for himself his own wisdom path distinct from that of the philosopher. The knowing to be sought is the kind of knowing we live by. His narrative re-enacts those acts of knowing by which we structure a life-story and come to affirm a self, and then later, transcend it.The mainstream of modern thought has, of course, led in the opposite direction. Reductionist mechanism aspires to corner the mind into some ultimate system, a self-made cage of thought - a Theory of \u201cEverything\u201d - from which it may never again emerge to see the light of day. Any access to immediate experience must be mediated by said totalizing System; any experience that does not fit therein is to be explained away. While we managed to keep at bay political totalitarianism as a civilization, intellectual totalitarianism still rules the day as an ever-appetizing lodestar. If we could but persuade ourselves to stay in the box we made, we might buy ourselves some semblance of certainty, provided we forget we ourselves have fabricated it. William Barrett, in \u201cThe Illusion of Technique,\u201d outlines this totalizing aspect of modern thought well when he shows how time and again, the great thinkers of modernity are subject to the irresistible temptation to \u201creify the objects of their symbolism,\u201d thereby becoming \u201cvictims of their own language.\u201dProust's approach to the whole question of how we may become wise differs from this mainstream in two ways: first, he avoids becoming a \u201cvictim of (his) symbolism\u201d by adopting a \u201cmeta\u201d stance vis-a-vis his own cognitive framings, and second, he validates the adequacy to experience of his methodology by continually touching base with where we actually stand in our most intimate dealings with the world through a close description of detail. I already touched on the first, but essentially, the critical decision here lies in his not assuming transparency and instead foregrounding and scrutinizing the constructive process of knowing a life as it unfolds. There is wisdom in this, for by pretending that our mental filters are transparent to reality, we risk mistaking the specks of dirt on our windowpane for features in the landscape. The fundamental working metaphor Proust operates with here is the magic lantern of the mind. This is introduced early on in the context of one of those childhood revelations that seems to suddenly make clear for us the sense of this strange, shadowy life. The young narrator lying in his bed awaiting sleep while struggling with separation anxiety from his mother, watched the projected fairytale images of the magic lantern gliding across his walls, furniture, doorknob. The reference to Plato's Cave is unmistakable, and yet the wisdom to be found here lies not in \"peering through\" to the substantial origin of these shadowy fairytale forms that float over the surface of our awareness. The umbilical chord to such cosmic orders is severed, for Proust as for so many moderns. We are left floating in a sea of images, that strange, in-between realm where mind approaches nature but never quite rests in a secure grasp of it. The best lucidity we can hope for comes from an acceptance of the free-floating quality of the magic lantern of our minds: it touches reality only when, as the projected fairytale images, the form is distorted as it glides over an obtruding object, such as the doorknob. The entire rest of the narrative is like a grand cartography of the magic lantern of the mind, and of the unshakable, unsettling, yet poignant sense of irreality that it brings to the heart of even our most lucid daylight experience. In this, Proust has a lot in common with the stripping down of layer upon layer of formal illusion that characterizes Zen meditation. The work is indeed much like a guided meditation manual. The hard-earned lucidity to be found at the culmination of the gathering back together act at the end of the narrative, in Time Regained, is one not of \u201cseeing through\u201d to some architectonic world-structure (which must always in the end be a cognitive artifact endlessly referencing us even as we struggle to wipe ourselves out of our picture); it is instead a lucidity that comes from a comprehensive grasp of the ineradicable stain our filtration systems leave on even the most intimate, seemingly immediate moments. We never stand in the light of day. It is a scary realization, but an unshakable one, and one that peers at the very heart of the human condition. We always stand in the shadow of our own form, and of our limited capacity for realization. Our relation to reality must be understood (and more fully realized) by incrementally beating against our walls, at last coming to make peace with them, and in so doing, finding our only possible transcendence. And second, we come to the crucial revelation detailed description allows and that theoretical systems by their nature must overlook. Detailed description, while making lazy readers cringe, is the writer's best friend, as well as his/her greatest advantage over the philosophical systematizer. It is how the modern novel becomes a philosophically significant epistemic instrument. In my review of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, I noted that Kant and Proust can be understood as complementary opposites of the phenomenological spectrum, and that a fully realized self-understanding must encompass both the stances that they represent. Kant offers the phenomenology of logical principles, Proust the sketch of phenomenological form by which we gain a hold of lived experience. I'd add here that there's simply no philosophical substitute for Proust and for the kind of world-disclosure his narrative technique enables: he is a better cartographer of Heidegger's Clearing and Husserl's Lifeworld than they ever could be (although I deeply admire both). And this is because his (literary) methodology allows him to scrutinize and lay bare the workings of that fundamental act of reflective thought: description. It goes right to the heart of our moment-to-moment encounter with reality in re-enacting the constructive framing we impose through our descriptions. One has to admire the lucidity and tenacity with which Proust takes up his analytical scalpel to the most indefinite, amorphous phenomena. He is, in my estimation, a cartographer of indefinite who charts the limits of representation, and thus, of our capacity for lucidity and meaning. To define and articulate the undefinable details of lived experience \u2013 while foregrounding the constructive nature of all such articulation, definition, and cognitive framing - is both his (insane) narrative task and greatest epistemic achievement. Relish a densely descriptive paragraph of his, say, of a summer field, or of the subtly shifting feel of the atmosphere and mood change of a room as different personages enter and exit. Countless pages meticulously render articulate what we usually allow to fester untapped in the margins of liminal awareness, through synaesthetic descriptions that try to recapture the comprehensive feel of the mingling of shades at twilight, of the shifting of air currents, of the interpenetration of music and scent, and then of the pain of lack running through it all, of never attaining some culminating state of sufficiency. For my own part, far from having to strain to appreciate the descriptive passages, I find they provide meditative exercise that gives me the tools to better bring my day-to-day experiences to articulate clarity, instead of lazily allowing them to glide past. In so doing, they intensify my capacity for awareness and presence in the world. Both cognitive form and narrative technique here are opened up to their widest capaciousness and plasticity in order to incorporate not only dramatic action, but its peripheral reverberation, not only central figure but its background of embeddedness, not only words but their echoes, too. I feel more alive after reading Proust, more present to my experiences, and more ashamed at how much of my life I let slip by me each and every day. The perspective the narrator achieves over his life here makes our usual biographical sense seem botched and anemic. In comparison, it seems like we have scarcely deigned to show up for our life story much at all. Instead of integrating and transcending in a moment of lucidity that surpasses our highest attained perspectival unity, as the narrator does at the culmination of the narrative when the various strands somehow coalesce, we just let it all slip by, rush on to the next thing, and through this habit enacted out of laziness, skim through our lives without delving deeper into the mystery they disclose. Experience washes over us and past us, leaving us untransformed and not building up to a unity, which is indeed wholly ours. His analysis of the pervasiveness of Habit as our substitute for awareness here is sobering. \u201cMost of our faculties lie dormant because they can rely upon Habit, which knows what there is to be done and has no need of their services.\u201d He shows how through it, we fall back on prematurely fossilized interpretive structures - \u201cour personality\u201d - and fail to rise up to the task of continuing to develop resources for gathering meanings as they continue to unfold and emerge. The entire work seems to urge us to recall that psychological maturation, unlike physical, doesn't occur automatically or is finished once and for all at a specific moment in time after puberty. It ends with death, or with its psychological correlative \u2013 the death we experience when we opt out of the necessarily ongoing struggle to continue articulating an increasingly integrative perspective on our lives. Premature unity is psychological death; through it, our lives become a foreclosed matter. As Beckett notes in his study of Proust, \u201cThe creation of the world did not take place once and for all time, but takes place every day.\u201d The same goes for our own little life-world. There is no resting in the process of endless formal development until death because experience never ceases to unfold new capacities for revelation. Our understanding can never rest content with yesterday's story when facing today's experiences. Proust shows us what the stakes for self-knowledge are, and this is as inspiring for us ordinary (barely aware) mortals as it is supremely humbling. And it is enabling, as any creative work should be. It shows the way to greater realization."}, {"userName": "Roy Lotz", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz", "userReview": "In reality, every reader is, while he is reading, the reader of his own self. The writer\u2019s work is merely a kind of optical instrument which he offers the reader to enable him to discern what, without this book, he would perhaps never have perceived in himself.\nI struggled with Proust, on and off, for three years. I read these books sitting, standing, lying down, in cars and on trains, waiting in airports, on commutes to work, relaxing on vacation. Some of it I read in New York, some in Madrid, Lisbon, Vienna. By now this book functions as my own madeleine, with different passages triggering memories from widely scattered places and periods in my life.I am surprised I reached the end. Every time I put down a volume, I was sure I would never pick up another; each installment only promised more of the same and I had already had more than enough; but then the nagging sense of the incomplete overcame my aversion and, with mixed feeling, I would pick up the next one and repeat the experience.Throughout this long voyage, my response to Proust has been consistent\u2014I should say consistently inconsistent\u2014alternately admiration and frustration. There are times when I fall completely under Proust\u2019s spell, and times when I find his writing intolerable. Probably this mixture has much to do with what Harold Bloom called the \u201canxiety of influence,\u201d since almost as soon as I finished the first volume, I started working on a novel, a novel which very clearly bears the traces of Proust\u2019s influence. It may be that, with Proust, I have something of an Oedipal complex, and I need to lodge criticism at his work in order to clear the air for my own\u2014though I don\u2019t know. What I do know is that my reactions to this book have proven tempestuous and I have yet to spur myself to write a fair review.When approaching a novel of this size and complexity, it is difficult to know where to start. Can In Search of Lost Time even be called a novel? In a writing class my instructor told us that any story needs to have a protagonist, an objective, a series of obstacles, a strategy for overcoming these obstacles, a sequence of failures and successes, all of it culminating in a grand climax that leads directly to a resolution. If you look carefully, you can, indeed, make out the bare outline of this dramatic pattern in Proust\u2019s work. But, like the slender skeleton of a peacock buried under a mountain of feathers, this outline serves as a vague scaffold over which are draped colorful ornament; and it is the ornament that attracts our attention.In most novels, any given passage will serve some dramatic purpose: characterization, description, plot. However, there are times when the author will pull back from the story to make a more general comment, on society, humanity, or the world. These comments are, very often, pungent and aphoristic\u2014the most quotable section of the whole book, since they do not depend on their context. Some authors, like Dickens, very infrequently make these sorts of remarks; others, like George Elliot, are full of them: \u201cWill not a tiny speck very close to our vision blot out the glory of the world, and leave only a margin by which we see the blot? I know of no speck so troublesome as self.\u201dElliot\u2019s masterpiece, Middlemarch, is distinguished for being simultaneously didactic and dramatic, equal parts analysis and art. Proust goes even further in the direction of analysis, totally overwhelming every other aspect of the book with his ceaseless commentary. No event, however insignificant, happens without being dissected; the Narrator lets no observation go unobserved, even at the cost of being redundant. This endless exegesis, circling the same themes with relentless exactitude, is what swells this book to its famously vast proportions. Tolstoy, no laconic writer, used less than half the length to tell a story that spanned years and encompassed whole nations. The story Proust tells could have been told by, say, Jane Austen in 400 pages\u2014although this would leave out everything that makes it worth reading.Different as the two authors are, the social milieu Proust represents is oddly reminiscent of Jane Austen\u2019s world, being populated by snobby aristocrats who jostle for status and who never have to work, a world of elegant gatherings, witty conversation, and artistic dilettantism. Austen and Proust also share an affinity for satirizing their worlds, although they use different means for very different ends. In any case, both Austen\u2019s England and Proust\u2019s France are long gone, and it can be very difficult for the modern reader to sympathize with these characters, whose priorities, manners, and lifestyle are so distant from our own. Why should we care about soir\u00e9es and salons, dukes and duchesses, who do nothing but gossip, pursue petty love affairs, and pontificate ignorantly in their pinched world?Yet this narrow social milieu, though always in focus, only forms the backdrop for Proust\u2019s real purpose; and this purpose is suitably universal: to create a religion of art. A new religion was needed. Proust was writing at a turbulent time in European history: in the aftermath of the Death of God, as the fin de si\u00e8cle high society of his youth was shattered by World War I, as new notions of psychology overturned old verities of human behavior, as every convention in art, music, and literature was being broken. Even the physical world was becoming unrecognizable\u2014populated by quantum fields and bending space-time. It was the world of Freud\u2019s unconscious, Einstein\u2019s relativity, and Picasso\u2019s cubism, when new theories about everything were embraced. Granted, Proust may have been only peripherally aware of these historical currents, but he was no doubt responsive to them, as this novel amply proves.In this book, Proust sets out to show that our salvation lays in art. This means showing us that our salvation does not lay in anything else. Specifically, Proust must demonstrate that social status and romantic love, two universal human aspirations, are will-o\u2019-the-wisps. He does this subtly and slowly. First, as a young man, the Protagonist is awed by high society. The names of famous actresses, writers, composers, and most of all socialites\u2014the aristocratic Guermantes\u2014hold a mysterious allure that he finds irresistible. He slowly learns how to behave in salons and to hold his own in conversation, eventually meeting all the people he idolized from afar. But when he finally does make the acquaintance of these elite socialites, he finds that their wit is exaggerated, their knowledge superficial, their opinions conventional, their artistic taste deficient. In short, the allure of status was empty.And not only that, temporary. In the final volume, Proust demonstrates that status waxes and wanes with changes of fashion, often in unforeseen ways. By the end of the book, Rachel, who began as a prostitute, is a celebrated actress; while Berma, who began as a celebrated actress, ends as a broken down old women, still respected but no longer fashionable. The Protagonist\u2019s friend, Bloch, who is a flatfooted, stupid, and awkward man, ends the book as a celebrated author, despite a total lack of originality or wit. The Baron de Charlus, an intensely proud man, ends up doffing his hat to nearly anyone he runs into in the street, while the rest of society ostracizes him. Status, in other words, being based on nothing but mass whim, is liable to change whimsically.Proust\u2019s views of love are even more cynical. The Protagonist does have a genuine affection for his mother and grandmother; but these are almost the only genuine bonds in the entire long novel. When Proust looks at romantic love, he sees only delusion and jealousy: an inability to see another person accurately combined with a narcissistic urge to possess and a paranoia of losing them. The archetypical Proustian relationship is that between Swann and Odette, wherein Swann, a figure in high-society, has a casual dalliance with Odette, a courtesan, and despite not thinking much of Odette, Swann nearly loses his mind when he begins to suspect she is cheating on him. He marries Odette, not out of romantic passion, but in order to gain some measure of peace from his paranoid jealousy.Summarized in this way, Proust\u2019s views seem, if somewhat disenchanted, hardly radical. But the real thrust of Proust\u2019s thinking depends on a truly radical subjectivism. This book, as Harold Bloom points out, is wisdom literature, firmly rooted in the introspective tradition of Montaigne. But Proust is more than introspective. A true Cartesian, Proust is solipsistic. And much of his rejection of worldly sources of happiness, and his concomitant embrace of art, depends on this intensely first-person view of the world.In his emphasis on the subjective basis of reality, Proust\u2019s thought is often oddly reminiscent of Buddhism. Our personalities, far from being stable, are nothing but an endless flux that changes from moment to moment; each second we die and are born again. What\u2019s more, we perceive other people through the lens of our own desires, knowledge, opinions, and biases, and therefore never perceive accurately. There are as many versions of you as there are people to perceive you. Thus we never really know another person. Our relationships with friends and lovers are really relationships with mental constructions that have only a tenuous connection with the real person:\nThe bonds between ourselves and another person exist only in our minds. Memory as it grows fainter loosens them, and notwithstanding the illusion by which we want to be duped and with which, out of love, friendship, politeness, deference, duty, we dupe other people, we exist alone. Man is the creature who cannot escape from himself, who knows other people only in himself, and when he asserts the contrary, he is lying.\nYou might think that this is a shockingly cynical view, and it is; but Proust adheres to it consistently. Here he is on friendship:\n\u2026 our friends being friends only in the light of an agreeable folly which travels with us through life and to which we readily accommodate ourselves, but which at the bottom of our hearts we know to be no more reasonable than the delusions of the man who talks to furniture because he believes that it is alive\u2026\nAnd love, of course, comes off even worse than friendship:\nAlmost everyone was surprised at the marriage, and that in itself is surprising. No doubt very few people understand the purely subjective nature of the phenomenon we call love, or how it creates, so to speak, a supplementary person, distinct from the person whom the world knows by the same name, a person most of whose constituent elements are derived from ourselves.\nIn the dissolving acid of Proust\u2019s solipsism, one can see why he considers both social status and romantic love as vain pursuits, since they are not, and can never be, based on anything but a delusion. Of course, status and love do bring people happiness, at least temporarily. But Proust is careful to show that all happiness and sadness caused by these things have nothing to do with their reality, but only with our subjective understanding of that reality. Depending on how we interpret a word or analyze an intention; depending on whether we hold someone in esteem or in contempt\u2014depending, in short, on how we subjectively understand what we experience\u2014we will be happy or sad. The source of all suffering and bliss is in the mind, not the world, but we are normally blind to this fact and thus go on mistakenly trying to alter the world: \u201cI had realized before now that it is only a clumsy and erroneous perception which places everything in the object, when really everything is in the mind\u2026\u201dAs you can see, we are moving in a strikingly mystical direction, where love and success are just egotistic delusions, hypostatized mental artifacts that we mistake for solid reality. So what should we do? Proust\u2019s answer to this predicament is also mystical in flavor. Normally we are trapped by our perspective, thinking that we are viewing reality when we are actually just experiencing our own warped mental apparatus. To break us out of this trap we must first experience unhappiness: \u201cAs for happiness, that is really useful only in one way only, by making unhappiness possible.\u201d And unhappiness results when something we mistook to be solid\u2014reputation, love, even life itself\u2014is shown to be fleeting and unreal, that our everyday reality is based on nothing but lies, mistakes, and misunderstandings. You might say this is Proust\u2019s version of Christian consolation. For in the despair that opens up during these crises, we can give up our fantasies and partake in Proustian mysticism.This mysticism consists in reconnecting with our basic sensations. To do this, Proust does not, like the Buddhists, turn to meditation on the present moment. Instead, he relies on art and memory. Normal language is totally inadequate to this task. Our words, being universally used, only convey that aspect of experience that is common to everyone; all the individual savor of a perception, its most essential quality, is lost. But great artists\u2014like the fictitious Vinteuil, Bergotte, or Elstir\u2014can use their medium to overcome the usual limits of discourse, transmitting the full power of their perspectives. Even so, this artistic communication can only act as a spur for our own introspective quest. Shorn of illusory happiness, inspired by example, we can probe our own memory and experience the bliss of pure experience.Memory is essential in this, for Proust thinks that it is only by juxtaposing one experience with another that we can see the perception in its pure form, without any reference to our conventional reality. This is why moments of involuntary memory, like the madeleine episode, are so important for Proust: it is in these moments, when a present experience triggers a long-buried memory, that we can re-visit the experiences of our past, free from delusion, as a pure impartial spectator. The final Proustian wisdom is essentially contemplative, passive, aesthetic, able to see the ironies of human life and to appreciate the recurring patterns of human existence.Proust\u2019s goal, then, is to do for the reader what Bergotte, Elstir, and Vinteuil did for his Narrator: to create art that acts as a window to the self. And his style is exactly suited to this purpose. In my review of a book on meditation, I noted what I called the \u201cnovelistic imagination,\u201d which is our tendency to see the world as a setting and ourselves as the Protagonist, beset by trials and tribulations. Meditation aims to break out of this rather unrealistic mindset by focusing on the present moment. Proust\u2019s aim is similar but his method is different. He takes the narrative tendency of the novelistic imagination, and stretches and stretches, pulling each sentence apart, twisting it around itself, extending the form and padding the structure until the narration is hardly narration at all, until you are simply swimming in a sea of sounds.By doing so, Proust allows you to feel the passage of time, to make time palpable and real, and to feel our memory processing and being activated over and over again in response to passing sensations. This way, Proust hopes to bring us in contact with reality: \u201cAn hour is not merely an hour, it is a vase full of scents and sounds and projects and climates, and what we call reality is a certain connection between these immediate sensations and the memories which envelop us simultaneously with them\u2026\u201dThis is my attempt to elucidate Proust\u2019s aesthetic religion. Of course, like any religion of art, it is objectionable for manifold reasons: it lacks any moral compass, it is elitist, it is purely passive. Not only that, but Proust connects with his religion a solipsism that is questionable on philosophic grounds, not to mention cynical in the extreme. It is a cold, antisocial, unsympathetic doctrine, with appeal only to disenchanted aesthetes. But of course, this is ultimately a work of art and not of philosophy; and so In Search of Lost Time must be judged on literary grounds. When it comes to the criteria by which we judge a usual novelist\u2014characterization, dialogue, plot\u2014I think Proust is somewhat weak. There is, of course, little plot to speak of. And although Harold Bloom thought that Proust was a rival of Shakespeare when it came to characterization\u2014a judgment that baffles me\u2014I felt very little for any of the people in this novel. They all speak in Proust\u2019s longwinded voice, and so never came alive for me. It always seems as if I am overhearing Proust describe someone rather than meeting them myself.But of course one cannot appraise Proust using these standards. This novel is, above all, audacious. It is a modernist tour de force, which turns nearly every novelistic convention on its head. More than that, it is a novel of ideas, which puts forward a radical view of the human predicament and its own answers to the perennial questions of life. It is wisdom literature rooted deeply in tradition, while being absolutely original and uncompromising in its newness. It is both intensely beautiful and intensely ugly\u2014hideously sublime. For anyone who can pull themselves through all its pages, it will leave them deeply marked.

I started reading in February, and now end this beast in November. Apparently, I needed a little wind-up to start and if the last 12 hours is any indication, I will need a wee bit of time to settle down from the mess Proust has left in my head.This is a book that feels like a hypnotic river that both transports, nourishes, warms and transcends. 4211 pages later and I feel like this is a novel I want to read again (both immediately and much much later). I had barely put down Time Regained and I was, like an orobus, reaching for 'Swann's Way'. I'm going to chew on my BIG review of ISoLT for awhile. I don't know if I'm ready to try to explain or even understand the whole of Proust yet. Hell, I'm not sure I'm ready to look at myself that closely yet.Reading Proust was a bit like reading 'Finnegans Wake'. Certainly not the details or style mind you. Proust wasn't deliberately sending his prose into language fractals, neologisms and ghillie suits of his own idioglossia. Proust isn't trying to capture or interpret the night or dreams (although dreams and sleep do play a part of ISoLT). Proust isn't trying to hide, he is seeking to uncover. Both works, however, are best approached as literature that shouldn't be sipped. These are pieces that you need to let wash over you. You will miss parts for sure, but unless you are a Joyce or Proust scholar you won't uncover 1/10 of what they are really sending your direction anyway. Let the prose roll. Let the message(s) seep into your conciousness. Beware of the designs of the left-brained temptor to stop every sentenece and try to comprehend completely what was written. Finnegans wake is too obscure and ISoLT is too damn long to do this. Pull your feet up, push your head back, and float -- damn you all.[a quick after note: the first four books of Proust I read were the Viking Translations done by Lydia Davis (Bk 1), James Grieve (Bk 2), Mark Treharne (Bks 3-4). The last three (Bks 5-7) were the Modern Library's Enright - Scott Moncrieff translations.]"}, {"userName": "Petra", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra", "userReview": "[A slow, meandering, detailed and lovingly ponderous look at Memory (forgotten, remembered, accuracy), Time (continuous continuum, linear, lost), Love and Nostalgia. Not for the lovers of fast-paced, action-packed drama. Not to be read swiftly but to be slowly savoured and chewed over. Funny, too, at times. Proust does have a sense of humour.In essence, without giving anything away, Swann\u2019s Way is told in 3 interconnected stories: one of childhood memories (soft, dreamy), one of painful, excruciating love (manic, driven, full of despair) and one of adult nostalgia and remembrance (sad, reminiscent, joyful, poignant). Proust brings the reader into these worlds and lets them experience them with the characters. This volume is a stand-alone, if one so wishes, but there are many open questions left to be answered; many unresolved situations to be explained. I\u2019ll be continuing with this book and look forward to the idea of knowing the characters better and meeting new ones. I really enjoyed Proust\u2019s characters: the sickly Narrator, Aunt Leonie, Uncle Adolphe, Swann, Odette, Vinteuil. They are all warm, \u201creal\u201d beings that the reader comes to feel for.Proust captures so many moments in Life: the stab of fear & pain that comes from the thought that one is losing one\u2019s love to someone else, the jealousy brought on by an uncertain relationship, the demanding love & yearning of a child for his beloved mother, trees at their moment of coming to life in the earliest of spring when only the trees know that the weather & season are turning, the taste of a madeline dipped in tea\u2026and so many others.

Such a writer was Marcel Proust. He has been called the greatest novelist of the 20th century, and the novel, A la Recherche du Temps Perdu, compared to Michelangelo\u2019s Sistine Chapel ceiling. But Michelangelo was known as \u201cThe Divine\u201d, while Proust was called a hypochondriac, a dilettante, a homosexual and a mama\u2019s boy. All of these things were true, to a certain extent, and when the first volume of In Search of Lost Time (Swann\u2019s Way) was published in 1913, Proust\u2019s friends were shocked that he had produced such a masterpiece. As Marcel himself said, there was not just one Proust, but many, and his many selves were often paradoxical and antithetical to each other. He used the ways of a hypochondriac to make people, mostly his mother, give him special treatment, yet he had his first asthma attack at age nine and struggled with ill health until his death at age 51. He was a social-climbing dilettante yet spent the last ten years of his life as a virtual recluse, shielded from the outside world by the cork-lined walls of his bedroom. He was a homosexual who wrote and spoke as if he deplored homosexuality. And he was a mama\u2019s boy who used the love and anguish of that relationship as a springboard for the novel\u2019s deep and enduring truths about all forms of love and devotion and life and art. But do we really need to know anything about the writer to understand, or even appreciate, the work itself? Remembrance of Things Past, or as it is more accurately titled now, In Search of Lost Time, is often described as a semi-autobiographical work, so can\u2019t we just read the books to know the man? No, in answer to both questions, but\u2026yes. Although Proust only peripherally identifies the \u201cNarrator\u201d in Lost Time as himself, the book closely parallels his life, possibly a better phrase would be reflects his life (as some key things are reversed, as if seen in a mirror). And at the risk of sounding dramatic, Proust gave this life- mentally & physically- to the service of writing these volumes. He gave the novel his life and in return, it gave him immortality. Proust was aware of this \u201cbargain with the devil\u201d he\u2019d made, and when he wrote fin at the end of the novel, he told his housekeeper/companion \u201cNow I can die\u201d\u2026and shortly afterward, he did. Knowing something of the life of this man can help illuminate the world of Lost Time, as a reading of Lost Time illuminates not just Marcel\u2019s life but all lives, our own included. That\u2019s one of the reasons why this work is regarded as one of the world\u2019s best, and why it is as relevant to us now as it was then and as it will continue to be in the future In Search of Lost Time actually consists of seven volumes, the first being Swann\u2019s Way. When these volumes were being translated into English, the translator changed the title, A la recherch\u00e9 du Temps Perdu, to a line from Shakespeare, \u201cRemembrance of Things Past\u201d. This is not only a bad interpretation of In Search of Lost Time , it\u2019s not even what the novel is about. Marcel hated it. He didn\u2019t much care for Swann\u2019s Way either, which in French is Du cote de chez Swann, but what could he do? He was only the author. So what is the novel about? And if it\u2019s so great, why do so many people start reading it but give up before they even reach the famous madeleine scene? Is it because of Proust\u2019s famously long sentences (the Proust Society of America says his longest is 958 words & may be the longest sentence in all of literature)? Or because, as one critic complained after the publication of Swann\u2019s Way, that Proust takes fifteen pages to tell how he turns over in bed at night? Yes. But when the long sentences and the seemingly random and rambling passages begin to coalesce into a whole, and the invisible web of past, present and future becomes visible and clear, then the magnitude of this work and the joy of reading it shines through.But what is it about? It's about life, from one life to all lives."}, {"userName": "Avis Black", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/930189-avis-black", "userReview": "I read the whole damn thing, for which I feel like demanding a medal.

year of reading Proust. Amen. This was monumental, a life event, like having a child or losing a friend or seeing a wonder of the world. Proust himself, I imagine, must have been rather annoying, but this subtle and (of course) incredibly long rail was unforgettable."}, {"userName": "Jimmy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1107219-jimmy", "userReview": "Andre Gide, who worked for the famous Gallimard press in the early 20th century, rejected Proust's manuscript for Swann's Way, which was the first installment of the epic Remembrance of Things Past. I often wonder whether or not he ever regretted this decision, but, then again, Gide had his reasons. As an avowed homosexual, he reproached Proust for the repressed homosexuality that was an obvious reality of the work. In example, the girl Albertine, who young Marcel pines for in the early stages of the work, was in actuality, Albert, based on one of Proust's lovers. Gide's criticisms weren't terribly inappropriate though. Through reading Proust's biography, one gets the impression that he was a shameless hypocrite. Then again, this also brings to light the question of whether Proust was less of a novelist than he was a philosopher/cultural critic/journalist/etc. It's funny because at one point in the work he references the literary critic Saint Beauve, who had a theory that the reader should be aware of every tiny detail of the writer's life in order to fully grasp the essence of their work. Remembrance is full of little tidbits like these; he also mentions the German literary critic August Wolf, who was famous for his theory that Homer was actually a sort of pseudonym for the various authors that had worked on the Odyssey and the Iliad.Honestly, Proust is an overwhelming subject in the space of a review. Piles of books have been written on the man, as well as his works, so I'm not even going to attempt any of that. What I will do is offer my opinion of his work.First of all, it's insane how what is Proustian plays into this analysis. In itself, my memory of Proust's work can be adequately evoked by a series of sensations that remind me of his work. For Proust, a lime tea soaked madeliene cookie (or tea cake) sparks the memory of an entire life time. This is essentially what is Proustian; any one of our given senses is capable of evoking a broad expanse of psychological memory. So when I am driving through, say, the desert in Southern Nevada, in the springtime, I am instantly reminded of the two or three months that I spent reading Proust. Of course, this is also clearly just another mysterious psychological quirk inherent in human memory, but it still stands as the inspiration for Proust's passionate reflections.The eponymous character of Swann's Way is an exemplification of the Belle Epoque renaissance man. This is Proust's idol in the early chapters of his masterpiece, a person who is aware of cultural fashions, yet at the same time displays a sense of weariness about how this particular brand of social prestige can actually benefit people. Proust was notorious for his scathing parodies of the characters that frequented the salons of his cultural reality. In other words, Proust enjoyed poking fun at his contemporaries. After three thousand pages of eloquent prose (Allain de Botton once pointed out the fact the the longest sentence contained within Remembrance of Things Past can actually be wrapped around an entire wine bottle (he shows a typographical example of this by presenting the sentence in a circular form, literally)) I am at a loss in attempting to point out the more significant parts of the work, but I do remember bits and pieces.Much of the scenes are contained within the confined space of the literary salons of Paris. These people discuss painting, classical music, literature, philosophy, the theater, etc. It's akin to Dickens in the way that Proust portrays each character. They are all presented as hyperbolic parodies of themselves. The Dreyfus affair acts as a political centerpiece for Proust's opinions; he once referred to himself as the most stalwart Dreyfusard (which is incorrect because the novelist Emile Zola was far more dedicated that he was, essentially facing exile for his fervent views on the subject, and the author who penned a letter of complaint to the president of France at the time). Proust goes on (and on) like this throughout the entirety of the work. It's the story of a neurotic consumptive who aspired to become a great writer (I have nothing but faith in the fact that he accomplished this). It's a story of heartbreak, disappointment, lost love, and failed relationships. It's an historically contained account of the intellectual milieau of late 19th century Paris. It is, in general, a sweeping autobiography written by one of the most curious characters that the entire canon of western literature has ever had to offer. In short, it's life as told through the lens of a effete, bourgeois, dandyish genius. The end is of course the most profound point in the story, as well as the most melancholy. At one of the very last social gatherings Marcel attends he can't help but notice how terribly everyone has aged. Oddly enough, it just now seems more apparent than ever. Proust muses on how literature has the profound ability to freeze moments of history in time. This rings true for him because he is the perfect example of what Freud would refer to as a man who replaced love and sex with research. Also, he is the perfect example of what Modernism would later become obsessed with, which is time, and the inherent difficulties that its philosophical significance carries. Given his fragile, physical state of being, it seems all too appropriate that his life goal was to offer us this intellectual insight into one of the richest moments of European history, that is, as opposed to actually living it.\"The idea of Time was of value to me for yet another reason: it was a spur, it told me that it was time to begin if I wished to attain to what I had sometimes perceived in the course of my life, in brief lightning-flashes, on the Guermantes way and in my drives in the carriage of Mme de Villeparisis, at those moments of perception which had made me think that life was worth living. How much more worth living did it appear to me now, now that I seemed to see that this life that at every moment we distort can be restored to its true pristine shape, that a life, in short, can be realised within the confines of a book!\""}, {"userName": "gufo_bufo", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70050060-gufo-bufo", "userReview": "Dopo averlo letto in una traduzione non molto soddisfacente, tento una rilettura in lingua, e provo la stessa sensazione di quando io, miope da sempre, esco dal negozio dell'ottico indossando un nuovo paio di occhiali con la gradazione aggiornata, e alzo lo sguardo verso gli alberi, e mi accorgo che quelle chiome che prima percepivo come macchie verdi sono in realt\u00e0 composte di foglie.

About varieties of love: eros (carnal), agape (unconditional/motherly), societal (admiration), divine (mystical/aesthetic). That last one isn't old-fashioned denominational GOD LOVE, but more like a recognition of the wonder of existence/beauty, often tinged with a wistfulness, or melancholy, since the instance of divine love is experienced without warning or reason and then only remembered/recaptured with decreasing intensity thereafter. Importantly, this sort of divine love requires one to have an innate capacity to experience moments of incapacitating/life-elevating beauty. The narrator has it, Swann does too, others also suggest an experience of rapture. (Others not so much -- I'm looking at you, Odette). Everyone knows the famous madeleine, but the other similar motifs/vehicles of ecstatic beauty come to the reader in passages just as good/memorable/beautiful about pink hawthorns and a phrase in a sonata. Not the stuff of visceral plot-driven fiction, alas. No plot. It's also about the experience of TIME, of course, and the book's length and approach exercise the reader's memory and reinforce a sense that time in the novel has really passed, in part because it's been days since you'd read a passage or image referred to later on. Sometimes felt suffused with chrysanthemum dust. Best when discussing solo apprehension of the divine. Slowest when about carnal superficial love and attendant tilt-a-whirl adolescent worries (like what little I've read of Balzac, Stendhal), and related highly calibrated societal sensitivities. Words I'd use to describe the prose and approach would include mixolydian, serpentine, rapturous, velveteen. At times like a psychedelic Stendhal, sort of. Good call by the translators to name the first volume Swann's Way instead of Meseglise Way, the true name of the path but not nearly as catchy a title! 4.5 stars rounded up for canonical status and the sense that it must be re-read to really appreciate once the whole thing's been completed. It's clear now that I'm 250 pages into the second volume that the prose in the first volume is softer, sort of prissier, redolent of youth in the country, more innocent than it is at least later on when it offers plenty of writer-related talk and brothels. A good time of year to read this stuff -- something about it matches the light in September (ie, it's \"radiant\" or \"luminous\"), although that might also have to do with the beautifully formatted Modern Library paperbacks. Within A Budding GroveNow just past his adolescent years, our nameless little narrator friend spends time at the Balbec beach and basks in the ambit of some fine young lasses after chatting with a kindly ambassador and a famous (albeit brutishly dressed and mannered!) writer he admires. The bits with Bergotte, the great writer, were fun -- I love great writers as imagined by great writers (the only other one I can think of is Arnheim in Musil's The Man Without Qualities, Vol. 1). I'm having trouble recapturing all that's covered in this one, particularly early on, since I somehow started it about six weeks ago. Good to see Swann and Odette years later, comparatively settled down, to feel like I'd experienced their most passionate episodes and now know them well, can see the world through their eyes and appreciate changes in character. Little narrator dude alludes to time spent in a brothel, just chatting of course, and in general seems a lot less wispily enthralled by pink hawthorns. Once he travels to the beach, he recognizes young yearning ladies but has a low estimation of his ill self and sort of holds his tail between his legs and talks not of sharing in their yearning but appreciating young ladies for how interesting they might be, something which at first seemed indicative of the author/narrator's sexuality but also nicely setup a change of tune (from bashful whistle to let's get it on) after hundreds of pages. Narrator hangs with some male folks his age, particularly Saint-Loup, who really stands out at first, erect as a silver bishop on the swirly shifting societal chess board, a kind kindred aristocratic kid for Marcel to marvel at and befriend. For the most part, over 730 pages, all that really happens (ie, in terms of a concentrated burst of action) is he tries to mack on a hot little lady who's asked him to come sit by her bedside after pressing on his hand, giving him meaningful looks, and speaking \"the language of affection\" with him, and so when he leans in to kiss her . . . I won't give it away since it's a relatively pleasurable payoff on page 701. This long second installment seems a little more solid as narrator comes into his own, essentially sides with writing over an ambassadorial career, and then develops his eye for beauty in art, nature, and pale little dark-haired ladies wired to please, all near the sea with its sets of waves as liquidy and luminously lapidary as the prose, as always. A cathedral is associated with rocky cliffs along the sea while talking to a cool painter guy who sees everything's intricacy and serves as role model and ambassador to the girls. Something continually of interest is the lack of Christian religious significance/influence and the suggestion that a sort of mystical artistic perception (all elements of life are embued with beauty!) transform the world into a cathedral. The end's very much about the first stirrings of adolescent eros, whose innocence is underscored by the hysterical tilt-a-whirl romance between Swann and Odette in the \"Swann in Love\" section of Swann's Way. This one ends with the recognition of his reserve of passion within, sort of how the first one ended with recognition of his reserve of divine love/artistic perception. It's not so much a \"five star\" book in itself -- some stretches really dragged and others soared -- but the overall project (its themes, characters, settings, execution, insight, and particularly its language of course) is without a doubt at least seven stars. Monumental without being monstrous at all. The Guermantes WayFive stars for the project, four stars for the bulk of this installment, although it leaps beyond stars every once in a while, which keeps me reading/rating it five stars. It's tough to pull off hundreds of pages of shallow conversations in super-rich salons of bygone Paris, but MP does it. Scenes of conversations among sometimes insufficiently characterized artistocratic characters is exactly the sort of stereotype old-timey canonical novels come up against when derided by those who've never read them. Questions readers tend to ask are: 1) what the heck are they talking about and 2) who the heck's talking anyway? Within those scenes are nuggets, morsels, scrumptious bon mots for the attentive reader to savor, but I often found myself fighting upstream through these long passages to get to the good stuff for me in Proust: Marcel rehashing things solo, self-analyzing, taking off on essayistic benders. Like in The Magic Mountain, another major modernist touchstone, where Hans gets caught in a blizzard and the novel hits an eighteen-star peak, in this one, at the beginning of section two, more than midway through, I think, the self-contained ~30 pages about Marcel's granny are about as good as it gets in lit. The sort of thing that's so good, so affecting, so smoothly rendered, so poignant, as they say, that the light of proceedings streaming fore and aft is refracted through its prism (I hope you're picturing the cover of \"The Dark Side of Moon\") -- like these ~30 pages of serious meaningfulness focus and color the narrator's grayscale social ambitions, emotional longings, and disillusionment with it all. Sodom and GomorrahLet's say three stars for interminable party scenes and seven stars for solo Marcel going on about grandma and dreams and seeing an airplane for the first time (maybe my favorite page/paragraph so far -- the end of 581 and most of 582). Oh place names reduced to their historical tribal derivation and places reduced to fancy homes where one is always welcome. That's sort of like the opposite of the madeline-induced association -- instead of something small mysteriously opening up rich far-reaching memories, experience transforms the wide-open endless mysteries of a girl on the beach, the name of a town along a train route, and the lofty aristocratic salons of Paris to something lesser/known if not quite quotidian. Oh Marcel, you lover of mystery, you mystic (pink hawthorns, Vinteuil's little phrase, Elstir's radiant sea cliffs), always flipping/flopping between incantations of adoration and indifference (whatever it takes to win the girl). Mostly didn't like how narrator condescends to his characters but toward the end I saw the point that he'd been disillusioned by, first, Parisian aristocratic circles and then Balbec's fancy/pretentious untitled folks. Spoiler: everyone's an invert. Loved the opening essay on inverts. (I love the word invert.) Albertine waltzing with a female friend in a mutally arousing way, with tah-tahs touching -- shocking! I don't have too much to say about how Marcel handles inversion. I suppose it's outdated but also, as a reader, I couldn't help being like dude the reason you're flipping and flopping about marrying Albertine and worried about her lady lovin' is that you, the author, clearly want to press your chest to the chest of someone named Albert. Didn't quite buy narrator's freakout about Albertine toward the end -- seemed histrionic/forced -- but loved the cliffhanger. In general, glad this one's over and glad I made it through. The prose pulls you through even if the characters don't seem as loved by the author as much as the artists Bergotte and Elstir, or revered friends like Saint-Loup. M. de Charlus (extraordinarily well characterized after hundreds of pages devoted to the book's most variable prickly invert supreme) and Morel (at this point, not much more than a cutout quarry of a handsome virtuoso violinist) are not the most charming folks. Nevertheless, dog-eared dozens of pages, especially toward the end, of Proust-y excellence. Flowing insight wins the day and makes the dual whirlpools of not always so scintillating chitchat worthwhile. Five stars for In Search of Lost Time so far -- four stars for this volume. The Captive and the FugitiveThe longest book I've ever read, longer than those with many more pages. I don't mean the complete Search -- I'm referring to this volume, a mere 936 pages that took me forever. If I'm honest with this impression, I should admit that I find Proust sort of stupefying most of the time. I can only read 15 pages at a time without dosing off or reaching for my phone. But every once in a while there's an image or insight that makes it all worthwhile. I mean, the book is regularly studded with the best of things I look for in books, my copy is regularly dogeared, but this installment is dense and nutso. For the most part, Marcel is with Albertine but doesn't want to be with her (\"The Captive\"), but once she's gone (\"The Fugitive\") he's obsessed with her again, madly in love, until he learns of her sudden spoiler alert. Most of the musing seems to be about whether Albertine is getting it on with women. The finest section, up there with the description of the grandmother's death, describes Albertine asleep. It's not riveting but it's surely real good and maybe even the best ever. Other bits take off, especially about music and Venice but they're not as clear as the bit about Albertine sleeping. When Proust's prose clarifies an image, be it a little phrase in a concerto, pink hawthorns, an airplane rising into the sky, or his lover asleep, he's the best. For me, when he brings the aristocracy on stage, he doesn't totally falter at all but I fall asleep. Memorable bits in this include asking Andree if he can watch as she gets it on with another woman -- or at least gently caresses a woman's arm. Also, the revelation about M. de Charlus and Odette, and about St. Loup at the end. In general, like in Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black,\" this depicts (more in summary than in scene) the tilt-a-whirl game-playing dynamics of the ending of an intense relationship. The gist is: say or do exactly the opposite of what you really want to say or do -- insincere concealment is essential to successful manipulation of a lover. As a non-reader, I hate that shit so much, but on the page, it's less frustrating/childish, although Marcel is starting to seem more and more to me like a manipulative obsessive sociopath. I mean, he can't seem to look at a young lady without wondering if she's a lesbian. In the end, it seems like he wrote 900+ pages of this volume so he could embed this bit of straightforward editorializing: \"Personally, I found it absolutely immaterial from a moral point of view whether one took one's pleasure with a man or woman, and only too natural and human that one should take it where one could find it\" (p 934). The violinist signs his letters to male lovers \"Bobette\" -- similarly I don't think I've ever really totally believed that Albertine (who at one points wants her \"pot broken,\" a euphemism for buggery) is not actually an Albert -- Gilberte is a thinly veiled Gilbert and Andree is really an Andre. Also, Marcel at one point says he'll get the commoner Albertine a yacht and a Rolls Royce -- the class stuff maybe makes me less a full-on lover of this? The prose is fantastic at times, the insight impeccable, but everything's so high-falutin and a bit unbelievable, especially the society stuff. More later -- it's hard to summarize since I've already forgotten so much, which seems like part of the point of Mr. Proust's massive project -- over time Marcel forgets Albertine; I've forgotten the first pages by the time I've reached the end. One more volume to go in the fall, before I read it all again 10 years from now. Also, the bare thigh on the cover of this one has maybe been photoshopped to the point of seeming unhealthily thin? Time RegainedTo say I've read the complete seven-volume novel now is truth and lie since it'll take a few more trips down the pair of \"ways\" and \"transversals\" before I can really call this \"read.\" Maybe my favorite volume for the fifty-page stretch where M. explicitly addresses the work to come. Some of the best writing about writing I've read. Otherwise, threads are tied up -- plus there's literal tying up (bondage), pedophilia (only a mention), WWI in Paris, zeppelins and airplane fighters at night (the prose takes off during the wartime sections). Toward the end everything is degraded by age, war, perversion -- entropy uber alles. The shortest and most accessible volume -- I'd maybe even suggest that intrepid readers might want to try reading this first before Swann's Way? Every fifth page dogeared. Proust, by this volume, has perfected his epigrammatic skills, for sure. Now at the end I have a better grasp on everyone in the world of Paris, Combray, Balbec and I'll appreciate it more next time through -- a volume a year every year forever. In this one, there was some satisfaction that M's stated intentions regarding solitude and society, and the moments of perception that make life worth living, jibed with my impressions of the novel -- it worked for me exactly as M. states he hoped it would. I experienced what had been experienced as the language sharpened as M. emphasized an impression's importance -- the maybe-too-famous madeleine, the pink hawthorns in bloom, the little phrase in the sonata, the aeroplane climbing the sky, his grandmother's death, Albertine asleep, slipping on uneven paving stones, sitting in a library room conceiving this cathedral dress of an Arabian Nights-like masterpiece -- ie, all these memorable solo ecstastic moments of sensory intensity rendered in riveting and superclear language, compared to long scenes in society of always perceptive yet oft-soporific calibrations of character. Loved that the church at Combray was ruined during the war; the image of old Odette; Charlus ultimately a depraved exaggeration of what he'd been; the tragic dissolution of Saint-Loup and the flat-bottom of his daughter's nose, same as her mother and grandmother's; M. the narrator dissolving into Marcel the author. As with most of these volumes, there were stretches were I was like will I really give this four stars? But then Proustian expository overdrive would kick in and save the day. Again, this was really just an introduction to a text I'm sure I'll return to throughout life thanks to its wisdom and insight, its structure and exemplary language, its world and its riches."}, {"userName": "Malini Sridharan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134026-malini-sridharan", "userReview": "This book is good reading if you have huge chunks of captive free time (like my 50 minute train commute).If you cannot dedicate at least 1.5 hrs a day, 4-5 days a week to reading, it is probably not worth starting. At that pace, I finished the novel in about 4 months with a week break between each volume and a few days of desperate magazine huffing in the middle of Guermantes Way. I read half in the modern library classics edition and half in the newer penguin translation. I had an easier time with Moncrieff (modern lib). However, Moncrieff's style of translation doesn't really seem to fit with the temporal setting of the book as well as the newer translator's versions. In Moncrieff, it seemed suprising that girls played tennis and were willing to show their ankles. So I guess it is kind of draw which translation to go for.Proust's insights read kind of like well stated prose poems from a high school girl's journal at times. I guess maybe all but Time Regained and parts of Swann's Way were like a super complicated YA novel. There is definitely a lot to get out of the book, it is just strange to try to describe something that is so long and has such a mystique of awesomeness and impossibility built around it. It's pretty amazing all the references to this book floating around in modern lit-- I missed all but the madelines until I read it.

Proust spent the last 14 years of his life, lying on a narrow bed, writing an unusually long novel titled '\u00c0 la recherch\u00e9 du temps perdu' or 'In search of lost time'. Since the publication of the first of the 7 volumes in 1913, 'In search of lost time' has been hailed as a masterpiece, and is consistently chosen by the critics and the public as the greatest novel of the twentieth century.'In search of lost time' (also known by the previous title 'Remembrance of things past') contains over three thousand pages, a million and a half words, and more than four hundred individual characters. It is the longest novel in world literature and undoubtedly a daunting task to begin. However, as the reader gets drawn into it, the daunting bit finally comes to an end. One needs to be aware that, in order to enjoy Proust\u2019s work in full, the more one knows about his life is the better. This is the case with all writers to some extent, but with Proust it is so to an unparalleled degree. In search of lost time is all about the narrator\u2019s past, the experience he has had, often in the minutest detail; the many people he has known, their characters, appearance and habits. In an almost autobiographical way, the life of the narrator of the novel almost mirrors that of Marcel Proust.Proust\u2019s biographers have a great time identifying the models for his characters amongst the people who knew him. Despite this autobiographical overtone, none of the characters are modelled on any one person. For example, the beautiful Albertine, whom the narrator loves, grew out of the many girls Proust knew and loved in his early years in Paris. They are an amalgam of several people, several physical traits, personal characteristics and situations, and it is this reworking of memory that is the subject of the novel 'In Search of lost time'. To some extent, all writers recaptured memory before Proust, and all writers have certainly done it since, however, no one has done it with such charm, wit, intelligence and perception, and no writer has produced work which had such profound effect upon his readers.In writing 'In search of lost time', what interested Proust was the human relationships in real life situations. His privileged birth and his connections led him into the society of the rich and idle, what was considered by some to be the top of french society. The imaginary world Proust created from this unique experience is the centrepiece of 'In Search of lost time'. In addition, Proust effortlessly incorporated many radical and world-shattering ideas into his novel. There are many distinct philosophical themes throughout 'In Search of lost time', however, two of the major recurring themes are time and involuntary memory. The taste of a madeleine dipped in tea makes the narrator to recall his childhood visit to Combray, a fictional country town. In this novel, Proust shows us that although time conquers everything, time also can be defeated through art and thus past can be recaptured and relived.In this monumental novel Proust also points out the causes behind the loss of time and encourages his readers to stop wasting time and begin appreciating their lives. In Proust\u2019s view, human beings, most of the time, walk past fascinating kinds of experiences without really looking at them, studying them - and that\u2019s what Proust wants his readers to do. He wants his readers to take their time to appreciate how rich and interesting the world is. The advantage of taking Proust\u2019s suggestion of not going too fast is that the world suddenly becomes more interesting in the process.Proust\u2019s last years were so plagued by bouts of asthma and his determination to finish what he has began, that it would seem to most people, that this hermit, who slept by day and worked at night, led a dismal existence. His walls were lined with cork to keep out the noise of the day time world. He could hardly go out without getting attacks of breathlessness. His friends could only see him if they met on unsociable midnight hours. He never found anyone to love or be loved by on a stable basis.However, his work was his life, through it Proust lived, and that the world is a richer and more humane place because of his remarkable work 'In search of lost time', is without doubt. Anyone who reads this towering work of literature will never be quite the same again. A peculiar warmth and humour pervades this vast novel. Proust asks so many philosophical questions, examines so many corners of human lives and mercilessly uncovers hypocrisy and evil, as well as charm and intelligence, but he does so with wit and sensitivity, and above all generosity of spirit. After putting down 'In search of lost time', readers would know that Marcel Proust\u2019s life was as rich and full as any life can be and the world literature is the better for it.Proust, Marcel.

Aber einfach nur wundersch\u00f6n. Kann man ohne Proust zu lesen richtig leben?28.06.2012 Soeben Sodom und Gomorrha beendet. Sehr, sehr interessant wie Proust die einzelnen Szenen miteinander verkn\u00fcpft, den Faden scheinbar verliert und in einer gro\u00dfen Erz\u00e4hlschleife wieder dort landet wo er hinwollte. Ich erwische mich dabei immer wieder zur\u00fcckzubl\u00e4ttern um die Lekt\u00fcre des Vortages zu wiederholen. Ich werden eine kurze Proust Pause einlegen um dann mit \"Die Gefangene\" fortzusetzen. Danach trennt mich nur noch ein Band von \"Die wiedergefundene Zeit.15.7.2012 Mit der Lekt\u00fcre von \"Die Gefangene\" begonnen. 19.8.2012 Leider erst auf Seite 262 da ich nur wenig qualit\u00e4tsvolle Lesezeit vorgefunden habe - und Proust lese ich nur in \"Bestverfassung\". Dieser Text gleicht in seiner Gr\u00f6\u00dfe einem Meer ohne Ufer. Ich m\u00f6chte mittlerweile auch keine Ufer mehr sehen und immer so lesend dahintreiben.07.09.2012 Die Gefangene beendet. Das Buch steigert sich in der zweiten H\u00e4lfte in ein bis dato von mir nie gelesenes Furioso.Einfach gro\u00dfartig. Wie nach einem Fieberschub brauche ich jetzt Regenerationszeit. Ich werde meine Proustlekt\u00fcre in zwei bis drei Wochen mit \"Die Fl\u00fcchtige\" fortsetzen. 14.10.2012 Es ist Sonntag, sch\u00f6nes Herbstwetter und mit gro\u00dfer Vorfreude beginne ich die Lekt\u00fcre.04.11.2012 Mittlerweile auf Seite 304 - mitten im gro\u00dfen Abgesang an die Liebe, das Erinnern und das Sterben. Ich komme nicht nach, Zitate f\u00fcr mich aufzuschreiben - sehr oft lese ich Abschnitte nicht um des Verst\u00e4ndnisses willen nochmals, sondern weil sie so sch\u00f6n sind.12.11.2012 Die Fl\u00fcchtige beendet. Das nahende Ende wirft seinen Schatten bis in diesen vorletzten Band. Faszinierend finde ich dar\u00fcberhinaus, die drei Versionen des Villeparisi-Norpois Diner. Ich habe das Gef\u00fchl ein wenig Einblick in den Zauberkasten des Marcel Prousts zu erhalten. Fast liebevoll betrachte ich den letzten Band und freue mich darauf, dieses \"gute\" Jahr 2012 mit \"Die wiedergefundene Zeit\" w\u00fcrdevoll zu beschlie\u00dfen.1.12.2012 (Samstag 6 Uhr) Soeben mit der Lekt\u00fcre begonnen. 29.12.2012 (Samstag 6 Uhr 37)Lekt\u00fcre beendet. Mein gro\u00dfartigstes, faszinierendstes Leseabenteuer findet nach 14 Monaten sein w\u00fcrdiges Ende. Unglaubliches durfte ich erleben, eine Zeitreise der ganz besonderen Art. Dieses Werk zu beschreiben ist mir nicht m\u00f6glich ich kann nur mein Staunen beschreiben - nicht einmal das kann ich. So unendlich sch\u00f6n ist dieser Text, so klug so weise. Ich habe die Ich-habe-es-noch-nicht-gelesen Leser f\u00fcr die zuk\u00fcnftigen Lesefreuden bei guten B\u00fcchern beneidet. Hier ist es anders - ich kann diese B\u00fccher immer zur Hand nehmen, einige Seiten lesen, und in die Welt von Proust eintauchen und darin versinken. Seine Sprache sch\u00e4rft mir die Gedanken und macht mich st\u00e4rker. So wird mich Proust auf meinem weiteren Lebensweg begleiten - ich Gl\u00fccklicher.Noch etwas:Die Buchank\u00fcndigung zu Anne Carson \"Albertine. 59 Liebes\u00fcbungen\" beschreibt dieses Gef\u00fchl nach der Lekt\u00fcre ganz treffend: \u00bb Wer von Ihnen je Proust gelesen hat, wei\u00df, wovon ich spreche, wenn ich sage, dass man sich nach der Lekt\u00fcre der Recherche in einer Nachproust-W\u00fcste befindet \u2026 weil einem nichts mehr lesenswert erscheint, und das Einzige, was du dir w\u00fcnschst, ist, dass dieser Proust noch mal von vorn anf\u00e4ngt, aber nat\u00fcrlich kann er das nicht mehr, und so liest du planlos alles \u00fcber Proust, Kritisches wie Biografisches, aber das ist nicht dasselbe, und so gibst du es irgendwann wieder dran und stellst fest, dass du schon \u2019ne ganze Weile in einem Proust-Entzug lebst, und das Leben geht weiter, nur eben etwas grauer.\u00ab"}], "description": "Desi aparitia primului volum al romanului nu a fost apreciata de editurile franceze, care il considerau a fi un fapt literar complet lipsit de viitor, ulterior critica literara a convenit ca romanul proustian este o creatie cu aspecte autobiografice, de analiza psihologica, in maniera bergsoniana. Intentia autorului a fost de a reconstitui trecutul nu ca durata consumata, ci ca exercitiu de percepere afectiva a consistentei unei etape. Pornit \u201cin cautarea propriei existente\u201d, Proust recurge la procedeul memoriei involuntare, crezind, ca si Bergson, ca adevarul nu poate fi cunoscut prin procedeul obisnuit al ratiunii, ci numai prin sondarea timpului psihologic, categorie imposibil de divizat si aflata in permanenta curgere. In ciuda marii lui intinderi, epicul este punctul de rezistenta al romanului, el fiind substituit adesea de analiza minutioasa a unor senzatii si stari sau de notatii privind aristocratia in perioada ei de declin, viata saloanelor pariziene \u2013 de unde si latura evident sociala a intregului. Intr-o incercare de simplificare ingrata, am putea nota nucleul narativ al fiecarei carti astfel: Swann debuteaza cu evocarea copilariei personajului-narator, povestire intrerupta de inserarea unei secvente erotice, \u201cO dragoste a lui Swann\u201d (protagonista fiind Gilbertine, fosta sa tovarasa de joaca); urmatoarele doua carti continua aceeasi linie a epicului, relatind despre a doua dragoste, Albertine, si despre profunda admiratie pentru ducesa Guermantes; cu Sadoma si Gomora, prezentarea lumii proustiene isi schimba unghiul si personajele, in centru aflindu-se salonul familiei Verdurin, baronul Charles si degenerarea erotismului in gelozia fata de Albertine; Prizoniera si Fugara propun doua ipostaze ale feminitatii din perspectiva egocentrismului masculin (Albertine este un timp sechestrata, apoi reuseste sa scape, dar moare intr-un accident); ultima carte suprima cativa ani din cronologia evenimentelor si il semnaleaza pe naratorul-personaj reintors din provincie si descoperind multe date schimbate in paradisul copilariei. Aceasta revelatie, anume ca arta si memoria pot face ca timpul sa fie regasit, este mult mai profunda, instituindu-se ca idee centrala a cartii.", "title": "In Search of Lost Time\n      \n          (\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu #1-7)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1834853.In_Search_of_Lost_Time", "average": 4.34, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1188981162l/1834853.jpg", "reviews": 449, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/233619.Marcel_Proust", "name": "Marcel Proust"}], "type": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Cultural", "Literature", "European Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1834853.In_Search_of_Lost_Time", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/167803._la_recherche_du_temps_perdu", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18796.In_Search_of_Lost_Time", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/797309.Remembrance_of_Things_Past_Volumes_1_3_Box_Set", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18268658-in-search-of-lost-time", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13183277-alla-ricerca-del-tempo-perduto", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16003545-alla-ricerca-del-tempo-perduto", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7810205-remembrance-of-things-past", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13329904-in-search-of-lost-time", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4819256", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10377508-alla-ricerca-del-tempo-perduto-7-volumi", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35183339-remembrance-of-things-past", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9677055-alla-ricerca-del-tempo-perduto", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/875748.In_Search_of_Lost_Time", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1613324.Auf_Der_Suche_Nach_Der_Verlorenen_Zeit_7_B_nde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12749.Swann_s_Way", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28385.In_the_Shadow_of_Young_Girls_in_Flower", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18798.The_Guermantes_Way", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18799.Sodom_and_Gomorrah", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28405.Time_Regained"]}
