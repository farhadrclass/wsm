This \u201cnovel \u201c based on a true story also begs the question - are these children many times coming from poor families better off because they escaped a life of poverty and hunger - stealing fruit, rummaging through scraps of food in the garbage? Easy to say yes . Yet while living a comfortable life, they suffer the tremendous loss of family, of belonging, of knowing who they are. I don\u2019t know how to answer that, but it is definitely reflected on in this story. It reminds me of the movie \u201cLion\u201d based on the book, A Long Way Home, which I definitely want to read since I loved the movie so much. Though, Saroo in that story is lost, not kidnapped, the loss of their families and their pasts and their journey home is similar. Eight year old, Chellamuthu, later named Taj by his American adopted parents, is abducted, sold to an orphanage. Years pass and while Taj is safe and loved by his American family, something is not right with him. He feels a sense of loss, not sure who he is . When studying in London and living with an Indian family, he remembers some things about his past and he develops a more than keen interest in finding out where he was from, in finding his family . And so the journey to his past begins. Along the way finding an Indian woman he loves. This is a heartbreaking story at times, as young Chellamuthu tries to figure out why he is at the orphanage, is picked on in school in America and really just wants that sense of belonging. Yet this journey of the heart and soul is joyful as well. Taj perhaps answers the question related to his own abduction when he says to his wife , \" I was torn away from my family as a boy. But if it weren't for being kidnapped, I'd be living right now in a village in India, speaking Tamil. I wouldn't be married to you. We wouldn't have our incredible girls.\" A solid 4 stars !

His family poor, he is made to do things he would not normally do by a group of older boys, boys that tended to be the bullies of the small town where he lived in.He will be kidnapped off the street, taken to an orphanage, and eventually adopted into an American family. He would eventually forget his early years until he starts getting glimmers of his past when he attend school in England and boards with an Indian family.Stories based on true events are always for me more significant. I enjoyed reading about his time in the orphanage which was run by a misguided man with good intentions. Chella will show his caring ways early on, trying to save another young orphan, but always missing his home, his real family. In America, his name will be changed to Raj, easier to pronounce, his new family hoping it will allow him to fit in at school. A very endearing story, startling loss, his new parents loving,, adopting many from different cultures when they can not have children of their own. He meets many people who will reach out to him with their willingness to help. At times the dialogue was too emotive, a bit overwritten but overall this was a wonderful story about a young man and his journey to recover his past.

Can't I read a book without crying! It was a good cry at the end though. Chellamuthu (Taj Khyber Rowland) was kidnapped as a child in India, taken to the Lincoln Home for Homeless Children and sold to people in America. The story starts out telling of Chellamuthu's life in India. The life he led with his family, the daily things he did, stealing and what not. He had a brother and a very kind mother, a father that was a drinker. He had friends. But one day when he was out with his father, he was taken. He ended up in the orphanage and we get to hear this story while he was there. He did escape once but came back with medicine for a sick child and I thought that was so brave of him. He made friends with other children in the orphanage and was so very sad to leave everyone and knowing he had a family out there. Chellamuthu was adopted/purchased by a loving family that had no idea the wasn't really an orphan until he was a little older. He had to learn to speak English and everything really. Linda and Fred Rowland were wonderful parents and did everything they could for all of their children. In the author's note at the end, he tells some things that had to get edited out of the book and it was interesting to learn those things as well. Chellamuthu's name was changed to Taj Khyber Rowland. He did really good in school and things with his mom's help. He was in wrestling and when he told his mom that he wanted to send the picture to his family in India, they realized he wasn't an orphan. It's really sad. When Taj gets older he meets a guy named Daniel who has a sister who would be Taj's future wife. Her name is Priya and it gave me chills because her father had some things to do with Taj's life at the orphanage. They eventually made their way back to India. They were married and made a home there. Taj did get his happy ending. He found his parents and brother again. This is where I cried because, come on! Eventually, Linda and Fred came to India to meet Taj's real mom and it was so bittersweet. Her name is Arayi by the way. I really liked this book more than I thought I would. It's a great story learning about what children are going through to this day. I think the author, Camron Wright did a great job in telling Taj's story.

My emotions were thrown all over the place while reading this book. I found it to be a very interesting story where I learned a lot about Indian culture and traditions, however I am saddened to think that this is actually based on a true story. I felt so much hope throughout the book - hope that things would \"turn out\" in the end. The entire premise of the story is such a tragic and upsetting situation that I had to take mini-breaks while reading to clear my mind.

Mischievous, disheveled, seven year old Chellamuthu is living in abject poverty with his family. The Gounder family lives in a house built of poles, mud and thatch. Chellamuthu is a spirited child who is always getting into trouble and mixing with the wrong crowd. While his mother lovingly encourages him to be honest, his quick tempered father teaches him a lesson. Using a hot poker, he burns the tops of his son's feet.Told to wait outside a building by his father, Chellamuthu is lured to a van with a promise of mangoes. He is snatched, thrown into a van which already contains babies, toddlers , a very sick little girl. and is whisked away to The Lincoln Home For Homeless Children. Insisting that he has a family and is not an orphan is of no consequence. He is told that his father has sold him. Eli Manickam, the Commissioner of Children's Services, is convinced that he is providing a valuable service by removing children from squalid living conditions and giving them food, warm clothing and clean living conditions while they await adoption. Chellamuthu's claim of having a family falls on deaf ears.Adopted by a loving couple in America, Fred and Linda Rowland, Chellamuthu (now Taj) becomes acclimated to his new parents, siblings and American way of life .Mastering English, he convinces his parents that he has a family in India and was kidnapped. All attempts to find his family are in vain. No help is provided by the orphanage staff. Taj's journey to find out who he is kicks into high gear while studying abroad in London.\"The Orphan Keeper\" by Camron Wright recounts Taj Rowland's relentless quest to find his India family. Taj's memories have long been repressed. He seems to be looking for a needle in a haystack. While he looks from America, unbeknowst to him, his Indian family has searched for him. Camron Wright has delivered a frustrating, heartwrenching true journey to discover Taj's ancestry.

Though poor and struggling, he had a loving family. That is until he was kidnapped and sold to the Lincoln Home for Homeless Children, a Christian orphanage. Any atempt to communicate the fact that he was not an orphan fell on deaf ears. Eventually Chellamuthu is adopted by Fred and Linda Rowland, an American couple. It takes a few months for Chellamuthu to learn enough english to alert his adoptive parents about his family in India. Thus begins a difficult journey of discovery.This novel lived on my nightstand for close to a month. It had nothing to do with the content, just too many distractions. Based on a real life story this book was thoughtful, profound and ultimately inspiring. While waiting for his father, Chellamuthu is lured into a van that takes off quickly and he is not alone. He arrives at the Lincoln Home for Homeless Children scared and confused. The staff insist he belongs there but Chellamuthu is no orphan. No amount of insisting gets Chellamuthu closer to his family. Rather he finds his way to the United States where he eventually becomes Taj Rowland. Having supressed his memories, Taj is haunted by his past getting small recollections that make no sense to him. Dealing with belonging and identity, the novel asks the question: how do we find our true home? Taj struggles as his past and present act as two separate entities rather than a complete image. There is only one way to learn who he truly is: he has to find his birth family. Heartbreaking, moving and sad, this novel was a compelling read.Taj was taken in 1978, at the age of seven. He lived the reminder of his childhood in Utah. As an adult, he was able to go back to India. The way in which he was able to locate his family is nothing short of amazing (in this regard his story is similar to that of Saroo Brierly). Aided only by his memory and a series of coincidences, he achieved what some considered impossible. While this work is written as fiction, Wright stayed as true to the story as possible. Sadly, Taj is only one of thousands of cases of children taken from their families. While getting an accurate number is difficult, its estimated that 40,000 children are taken from India every year for a variety of reasons, including false adoptions. I am glad Wright helped bring this story to the forefront and hope that many more children victim to this situations find closure."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3060349-karen", "userReview": "This story is a remarkable one and based on true events.

The boy\u2019s adoptive parents eventually find out he has a family back in India once Chellamuthu can speak enough English to tell them months later, but their attempts to track down his family prove futile.

I was fascinated and mesmerized by his account. The truth about children in India who become homeless or sold is horrific and not for the faint of heart. In fact, I just finished another book (I forgot which one) of a girl raised to be a prostitute and her experiences in the sex trade, held hostage for years. The boy in ORPHAN KEEPER has a unique story in that he is kidnapped from a loving home and sold to an orphanage to be adopted out. He is treated well and ends up in a loving home in Utah where his new parents have no idea he is not an orphan. Because of the language barrier, the newly named Taj is incapable of communicating this until much later. What I learned from the previous books I read about children in India, particularly when they don't even know the town they are from, is that most children die in the streets or in the sex trade. Which is why I am befuddled why he was targeted to be kidnapped with so many homeless children. The true story of how he was kidnapped is probably not well remembered and the recounting is postulated. But finding his way back home would take nothing short of many miracles to reunite himself with the family he forgets for a time in order to focus on going on in this new culture. In fact, I watched a short review of his story with the author of the book so I know some events were postulated, some were skipped, while others were simplified. The story of Taj's memories returning was simplified for the sake of the flow of the book. In fact, Taj serves a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in England and is reintroduced to the foods and smells he knew so well as a child which stimulates brief snippets of memory. This is introduced differently but with a great deal of clever artistic license.Great story.

The plot thickens quickly, as little Chellamuthu/Taj isn't actually an orphan, and has a biological family that he's torn away from. Camron Wright has written, really, two books here\u2014the first half about Taj as a child, the second as an adult, in search of his \"real\" family. It's the latter half of The Orphan Keeper that was the most engaging, as the voice becomes stronger and the storyline gains momentum.

There were some writing-style issues that took me out of the storytelling. The lengthy beginning, while a beautiful description of India, was frustrating to me because at the halfway point Chellamuthu was still in India and I was ready to find out about the second part of his life. Then there's a ten year gap- but actually I really wanted to know what his life was like in that ten year gap (specifically his parents and his relationship to them). Then, as an adult (or rather, a young adult, as really he was only in his early- to mid-twenties in the ending parts) he struck me as very self-centered and self-serving. If he was a female character, she'd be critiqued as narcissistic, abrasive, high maintenance, etc, but as a male character he is portrayed as being in charge of his own destiny, resilient, forward moving, etc. Also, lines such as \"For good or bad, when God had baked LInda, he doubled measured her compassion\" made me roll my eyes.That being said, the book did raise some interesting questions in my mind. It would seem that by being kidnapped, sold to an orphanage, and raised in America, he was able to live a \"better\" life- clean, clothed, fed, educated, and now an owner of several successful businesses. Does that justify the actions of the orphanage owners? Also I'm interested in the concept of love at first sight. It seems pretty unreasonable and yet some people swear by it. Finally, the continued prevalence of and adherence to the caste system in India- a slightly ironic twist to Taj's story. The second half of the book kept my attention more than the first,and even the things I didn't like about the story at least gave me pause for thought, instead of just \"bleh\", so I suppose I'll up it to 3 stars (but really 2.5)."}, {"userName": "Deyanne", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4274599-deyanne", "userReview": "At the core of this novel is the abduction of a child.

The source material possesses so much promise. A young Indian boy is kidnapped, sold to a Christian orphanage, and adopted by a couple from the United States. I was excited to read such an intriguing story, but was sorely disappointed by the clumsy writing.At its core, The Orphan Keeper is a journey toward identity and self discovery. However, the writer never dives deeply into the relationships or introspection experienced along the way. He seems too busy driving home his inspirational platitudes to really provide a substantial novel. The writing style is simplistic and choppy, and utilizes an overabundance of awkward similes and metaphors. I found the writing highly distracting.Taj's story itself is definitely compelling and inspirational. I'm just not sure a fictional account based on a true story provided the best format to showcase such an incredible journey. If the author really wanted to go with a novelization, he should have added layers of complexity to the characters. If he wanted to stay completely true to Taj's experiences, he should have stuck to a non-fiction format.

His command of the Tamil pronunciations and cadence of the language was brilliant.More than a third of the book was set in India which I felt gave an honest portrayal of Chellamuthu\u2019s daily life, surrounded by poverty, constant hunger, but also a loving mother, siblings and extended family who cared for each other. I appreciated learning more about the Hindu culture, traditions, and beliefs. I think the author painted a believable picture of what it was like for Arayi, Chellamuthu\u2019s mother, as she mourned the loss of her son. The land owner, Mrs. Iyer, shared a poignant experience of her own grief which I found inspiring.\u201d\u2026Lord Shiva helped me understand that my only journey of concern was to be like the sun, to make it through the day offering as much light and warmth and consistency for others as I could\u2014one single day. Each day.\u201dThe abduction of a child is devastating for all concerned with repercussions that are far reaching, but none more so than for the child. This story addresses the impact of those feelings for Chellamuthu/Taj as he also mourns the loss of his family, trying to adjust to the orphanage, and then being torn away once again. Then to compound this by bringing a child into a completely foreign culture, language and customs had to be utterly overwhelming!I delighted in experiencing Chellamuthu\u2019s wonder as he took in the luxuries of American life. So many toilets\u2014so much food---seeing a decorated Christmas tree with lights and the descriptions of American food compared to Indian. \u201dWhile the food at Lincoln Home had been constant, perhaps even repetitive, at least it stood up and talked back. It was pungent and flavorful, tangy and mysterious. It had opinions and it shared them whether you agreed or not. In contrast, American food was\u2026lonely.\u201dJust as we are being immersed in Taj\u2019s life as his American parents begin to teach him English, we are thrust ten years into his future, and he is now a high school senior. I would have liked more detail about those interim years as well as more about Maneesh, but perhaps the author felt he needed to move the story along. Taj seemed somewhat lost at this point in his life as to where he belonged or what he wanted to do. Always feeling that he didn\u2019t really \u201cfit in\u201d anywhere. From this point we follow his journey of discovery which I found fascinating. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, because it was a story based on true events in the life of Taj Rowland.

The bright orange colors definitely made me want to read where this book was all about. And after I read the book description I just knew I wanted to read this book. Although I don\u2019t read a lot of non-romance novels at the moment, this book based on true event really was one I needed to read.\u2018The Orphan Keeper\u2019 is the story of Chellamuthu. The story begins when Chellamuthu is just a little boy, living in poverty with his family in India. Although Chellamuthu is poor, and has to work from a very young age, he is just like other young boys. Chellamuthu is really curious and loves playing with other young boys. Especially when playing with these boys makes him able to get his hands on some fruits. But this also means he is easily distracted and forgets to do the things his parents ask of him. One day, Chellamuthu is playing outside when he is suddenly abducted and taken to a city hours away from his family. Soon Chellamuthu finds himself being adopted by an American family who have no idea he is abducted.This book was definitely something else.

What happens when Chellamuthu, renamed Taj, sets out to find out who he is and if he still has a family waiting for him somewhere is deeply moving.

I wondered the whole book through if his agency was involved in this placement, but I've been told they were not. International adoptions have come such a long way since then. There are many safeguards in place to make sure that the children placed are actually orphans, and that kidnapping and child trafficking is not occurring (some still does of course). So many safeguards and regulations are in place now that international adoption in the U.S. is at the lowest numbers since the early 1980s. I have worked as a social worker for an international adoption agency for over twenty years. This book was still eye-opening to me, and I am grateful for the great strides we have made in adoption since the time that this adoption occurred. A placement like this wouldn't happen today. I have never had an adoptee successfully track down their birth family, so this was nothing short of a miracle in my eyes. I enjoyed the book quite a bit. I was a little bit bothered by the novelization of it. The real details were so interesting to me, that I didn't enjoy the changes made for the sake of the story. I think I would have preferred it to have been a memoir or biography, rather than a novel."}, {"userName": "Jaymie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6089695-jaymie", "userReview": "I think 3-4 stars. I really loved the first half of the story. The second half was just okay for me. I felt like there were too many unanswered questions. Like what happened to Eli when the orphanage was searched by police? What about the kids that he told to run away? What about the young man that took Taj in the first place? Why was Taj so upset with his adoptive parents? Why is the father in law not saying he knew when he saw the poster or did that even happen? I didn't know much of the story before reading but am learning that some info was changed or maybe guessed at. I think I'm expecting too much from a true story that can't be known. I can't imagine this happening to me and the story makes you wonder if this was a Better life for Taj even though it's heartbreaking? I don't know. Makes ya think. His birth mother is the part of the story that broke my heart. I love When they were reunited. So amazing that he found them. A Miracle!"}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13091714-anna", "userReview": "3.5 rounded upI feel somewhat conflicted about this book. I enjoyed reading it, but, for some reason, found the novelization difficult. I kept wanting it to be a memoir, perhaps it was the photo section at the end, but I often found myself wondering where fact stopped and fiction began.Taj (Chellamuthu) is moody often angry and defensive both as a child and as a man, perhaps with good reason, but this was sometimes wearing to read about. In the end though it is a fantastic story and worth reading."}, {"userName": "Lindsey", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9911398-lindsey", "userReview": "This is the 2nd Camron Wright novel I've read, and, as with the first, I wasn't a huge fan of his writing style, but he definitely has a talent for creating a page-turner.
