Von pens another fantastic installment to her Wunder series in the prequel, DreamZ. The author pulls the reader into her unique world through Wunder\u2019s point of view first by giving a glimpse of her past.Wunder dreams of the same faceless, dark-haired lover with the amazing eyes every night. These passion-filled, immensely heated dreams with her lover leave her feeling beautiful and loved. The author explores Wunder\u2019s tight-knit relationship with her father, which is wonderful sight to see. Along with the father-daughter relationship, the author explores Wunder\u2019s relationships with her Resilient Infected Police team partners, especially Tank. As a person that is part zombie, Wunder has special powers that she takes very seriously along with her team training.The second half of this story is told from Pete\u2019s point of view. The author develops Pete\u2019s past and explores how Pete lost his parents in a zombie attack. Pete, who is part zombie too, has a close relationship with his Uncle Michael, who has taken care of him since his parents\u2019 death. For years now, Pete experiences very vivid erotic dreams with a mystery woman he has yet to meet. Pete is also a member of the Resilient Infected Police, but he\u2019s not on Wunder\u2019s team. When Pete\u2019s team is assigned to work with another team, Pete sees his mystery woman for the first time, Wunder.I thoroughly enjoyed how this prequel really sets up that Wunder and Pete are meant to be together, which makes their relationship in Wunder all the more special. Wunder and Pete are young and engaging couple to cheer for! I, for one, can\u2019t wait to see them take on the zombies together.Since there are time line continuity issues between DreamZ and Wunder, I would recommend that this series should be read in order, even though I didn\u2019t do that. DreamZ is a delicious fast-paced read that is impossible to put down.I received an eBook copy from the author for the purpose of an honest review. I was not compensated for this review, and all conclusions are my own responsibility."}, {"userName": "Maria S ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16632603-maria-s", "userReview": "I loved the first Wunder book; this one had me hooked from start to finish. It's not a long read, but it is intense, beautiful, heartbreaking and thoughtful.The voices of Wunder and Pete are easily identifiable, and very believeable. Wunder and Pete are in their early twenties, and their voices are young, but not childish. Wunder especially has a fresh tone. Pete is a little younger, but sounds older to me. One feels that he has experienced more of the trauma of life, and so much is communicated within a few sentences. The strong father figures of both our hero and heroine are well written, especially the scenes between Wunder and Lance (her dad)Even if you aren't a fan of zombies, or even futuristic genres, the subtext within the book can still make for introspection in our modern world.At 77p, it's a snip and the best money I've spent all month!Congrats AR, you've done it again."}, {"userName": "Jaime Buncie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16566272-jaime-buncie", "userReview": "Prequel to Wunder 1.

Here is where Wunder and Pete first meet.. Even if they don't officially meet until book one.One nice change about this prequel is you not only get into Wunder's head.. but you get a taste of Pete's as well.I wonder if book two if the reason Wunder and Pete were sharing dreams before they met will be explained, after all I'm sure both are just as curious about it as any one that reads this book will be.As this is a short I really can't speak anymore on it without giving anything away.

I mean come on. You gotta love a woman who packs a taser, at least two guns, and various sharps on her person. She\u2019s a chica prepared! But don\u2019t let that tough exterior fool you, underneath it all this female is all heart. And that heart yearns for the one man who haunts her every sleeping moment.Enter the mystery man of her dreams.Wunder\u2019s reveries of this raven-haired guy are intense\u2014blood and body combustible intense. I was like, \u201cDamn girlfriend!\u201d You know a dream is intense when you need a cold shower to douse your flame. Transport me to the nearest freezer and pile on the ice!Meanwhile, Pete is having his own dreams filled with lust and overwhelming abandon. This \u201cWonder woman\u201d is tall, dark-haired, and gorgeous. Only problem is that he never sees her eyes. In his wet dreams, they engage in all sorts of sensual activities that leave him literally stuck to his sheets when morning comes.Who is this mystery woman and why can\u2019t he see her eyes?Rounding out the cast are a dutiful and devoted father who lost the love of his life when his pregnant wife passed on after delivering Wunder, and a loyal uncle raising his equally special, but orphaned, nephew. The father figures added depth to the story and an extra tier to the almost painful pasts of these two destined people. I\u2019m an emotional reader and tend to connect to characters via the relationships they form within the confines of a book\u2019s pages. The Wunder prequel did not disappoint. This book was layered with many relationships\u2014the uncompromising love of a father for his unique daughter and an uncle for his nephew, the loyalty of the R.I.P. team for one another, the passionate longing of a man for a woman he\u2019s yet to meet.I was most impressed with the author\u2019s ability to competently convey the many facets of Wunder. For me, the best heroines are strong-willed and tough, while also possessing a sensitive side that softens her to right man. The Wunder Prequel was a prelude to predestined passion and the first taste of a unique miniseries with attitude. A definite 4.5 star treat for zombie lovers and romance enthusiasts alike."}, {"userName": "Gaele", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9146116-gaele", "userReview": "The prequel to the very fun Wunder series has A,R, Von providing a solid backstory for the two main characters: Wunder the half-zombie and Pete, her meant to be love. While I am not a fan of zombie stories, Von has made this such a sweet and touching series: in this book we are provided insight into Wunder's connection to her father and her recurring dream of a faceless man that is meant to be hers. Her dreams are passionate and detailed, leaving her breathless and full of need come morning. A need that she fills by concentrating on her assignment with the Resilient Infected police team, as she develops relationships and learns to rely on partners. The second part of this story focuses on Pete and his desire to revenge his parents' deaths, which he does by working with a team of Resilient Infected police. His nights are also spent dreaming of a woman he has never met, the woman made for him. Until his team is assigned to work with another team of RIPolice, and he comes face-to-face with the woman of his dreams in Wunder. While they both find an instant attraction to one another, the realization of their \"meant to be' status takes a tiny bit longer. The build and development of the story to present a solid background for these two characters works to both entertain and inform, and while the first book of the series whets the appetite, this one certainly fed it beautifully. Read these in sequential order, or read this after The Approach (the first in the series), but read them. A quick entertaining read that is wholly unique."}, {"userName": "N.A.

The action and story based around the steamy wet dreams and bursting at the seams lust for a complete stranger is well told. Even the naughty bits that I did happen to catch were great. I highly enjoyed the action scenes myself! I mean, if there are going to be zombies you have to kill them right? So all in all, sexy dreams, hybrid zombie/human girl getting her panties into a hot mess over a zombie/human hybrid boy that she has never met, lopping off intelligent, fast moving zombie heads and discovering a world that is trying to rebuild after a massive hit is actually pretty decent. I would recommend to anyone wanting a bit of actions mixed in with their spicy love making scenes."}, {"userName": "Crystal Marie", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14138637-crystal-marie", "userReview": "4.5 stars from me!\tI was lucky enough to be able to beta read this book, and let me say, HOLY HOTNESS!

My first read by A.R. Von as well. I won this in a blog hop giveaway as well. I have to say at first I really didn't know what was going on. Then it hit me the world had about ended or it did, and there are zombies because of a virus. Wunder is like a hybrid and she thought she was the only one. She has been having really erotic dreams of a guy and herself. I mean hot and steamy dreams that every time she starts to think about it she gets turned on.While out on a mission they were attacked and once they got everything calmed down and all the survivors were helped up into a truck to be taken to base. Wunder hears a voice that sound so familiar to her. She turns around and OMG it is him. The guy in her dreams. She is frozen in place and can't believe he is real. Wunder #0.5 is a good short read.
