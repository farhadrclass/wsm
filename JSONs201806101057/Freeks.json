I love books about carnivals and the 80's but I'm not too sure about this one yet. I really enjoyed how the characters are all one big family but there is something and I can't put my finger on it yet. The ending was meh and a little cool at the same time.

I mean, just look at that cover!!!!! I\u2019ve also read plenty of Amanda Hocking in what I now refer to as \u201cthe time I was brainwashed and inducted as a member in the Twilight cult,\u201d so I wasn\u2019t even scurrrrrrred that I\u2019d hate it. And I didn\u2019t hate it \u2013 I just didn\u2019t like it very much either. (In the immortal words of one Roger Murtaugh - I think I\u2019m getting too old for this shit.) But let\u2019s get on with the show, shall we????HURRY HURRY HURRY STEP RIGHT UP AND BUY YOURSELF A TICKET . . . . \n(Except this one takes place in the 1980s and never effing stops reminding you about it with not-so-subtle insertions of things like \u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re Corey Hart\u201d (\u2018cause dudebrah wears his sunglasses at night) or popping out to the local video store to snatch up a copy of Top Gun and Weird Science or making sure to crank the volume on the ol\u2019 Tears for Fears.)Gideon Davorin\u2019s Traveling Show has come to town for one reason and one reason only. It\u2019s broke. An offer of a week-long gig with a hefty paycheck has the caravan rolling and ready to give the locals something they won't soon forget . . . . \nThis is your typical freak show complete with strong man, bearded lady, dude who can swallow swords, etc. It\u2019s also where Mara (who so far has not been blessed with a special ability) lives with her psychic mother. When presented an opportunity to pretend she\u2019s just a normal girl and hang out with a local boy Mara jumps at the chance. But it doesn\u2019t take long for the reader to start to think things might not be exactly what they seem . . . . \nAnd for members of the troupe to start disappearing.As I said, I\u2019ve read plenty of Hocking\u2019s books before and for the most part they were okay for me. This one just wasn\u2019t great, however. The whole \u201880s thing was trying to hard, Gabe\u2019s secret was a little too obvious, there were way too many pages for such a small amount of plot, and worst of all I\u2019m not exactly sure who the audience was supposed to be since it read really young but there was uhhhhhhhh penetration if ya know what I mean. But please remember who is talking. When I saw that cover and title my brain went one direction and one direction only . . . . \nAnd when someone pulls out a hidden weapon in order to lay the smackdown, pretty much everything is going to pale in comparison to what I\u2019m thinking of . . . . \nToo soon????????

Beware spoilers ahead!I received this E-ARC via St. Martin's Griffin and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. I am also participating in the blog tour. I had heard about this book through Netgalley. I was scrolling one day and came across this book. It sounded good and some of my friends were reading it. I am happy to say that I enjoyed this book!The book is written in first person all in Mara's point of view. Before every chapter there is a picture of a tarot card with the date and the year. This book does take place in the eighties.The book begins with Mara and the circus traveling to their newest location. Mara's mother and her boyfriend Gideon have a bad feeling about this location but they need the money. One of their former members lives in said town and promised them a good deal.Mara would love the idea of living a normal life. While she likes her family on the circus, she would like to stay in one place and maybe start a family of her own. Whenever Mara reaches a new town she explores it the night before any of their performances.While exploring the town and taking in all the houses Mara runs into this girl dragging her drunk boyfriend. Mara offers to help said girl. Later the girl invites Mara into the party where Mara meets the girl's brother Gabe. She is instantly attracted to Gabe and spends the night with him.The next day Mara's mother is asking her whether she has seen one of their members and her roommate Blossom (I think that's her name). Mara has not. This is actually quiet normal for Blossom to disappear and come back again. Which is why Mara doesn't worry about her. On the other hand Mara's mother has weird vibes about the town and sends Mara and Gideon to inform the police. Informing the police doesn't really go anywhere but at least Mara's mother is appeased.As the book continues weird things start to happen to the circus crew. A majority of their powers aren't working properly. More people have gone missing. Something seems to be only targeting and killing the circus crew, specifically those who are the most powerful. Mara actually starts having these nightmares about a woman screaming something at her in another language. And the town is just giving off weird vibes. The town thus far has do nothing to help. It's up to Mara, the circus crew, and Gabe to figure out what's going on.To be honest I wasn't sure what to except about this book. I had heard about Amanda Hocking before but have never actually read any of her other books. I was kind of surprised that I enjoyed this!I really liked basically all of the characters! Mara's voice felt real to me and I understood her longing to live a normal life. I have actually forgotten all but three characters names, so I don't remember Mara's friend's names. Which sucks but is also not surprising seeing as I read this back in October 2016 and didn't take any notes. I apologize in advance for any confusions.I liked the relationship Mara had with her mother. It wasn't complicated but instead the pair were quiet close. Mara and Gideon had a good relationship as well. Now you would think that they'd have an awkward relationship seeing as he is dating her mom, but surprisingly they were close as well. Gideon genuinely cared for Mara and all of the other performers.The powers were really cool to read about! I actually didn't hear about some of the powers so that was nice. Mara's mother could predict the future using tarot cards and allowing the spirits to speak to her. This did have a negative affect on her physically and mentally. This was the same with all of their powers. I found this to be very original as I have never read about paranormal powers having negative effects on the people themselves.Mara's friends were nice and they all had a good relationship with one-another. Mara also becomes friends with Gabe's sister whom I loved. As for Mara and Gabe's romance it was very quick. It wasn't insta-love so much as insta-attraction. Normally I don't like reading about rushed romances, but I didn't mind it in this book. I really liked Gabe so maybe that's why I let it slide. There is an LGBTQIA romance as well. Both the characters are already dating before the book takes place so you didn't get to see their romance develop.The setting was fantastic! This was my first eighties book and it certainly won't be my last. I also felt I was walking right next to Mara as she took in the town and described the circus and some of the places she went to.I did not see any of the plot points coming! I found it very original and entertaining to read about. Note this book is more focused on the characters and the setting. It's a decent pace but not a whole lot happens right away.I only had one problem with this. In the beginning I found that not much happened in the book (which I mentioned above). It took awhile for some of the characters to go missing and for the circus to realize that there was something up with the town. After some time I got used to it. I started to get sucked in because I really enjoyed reading about the characters.Overall this was a good standalone! I recommend this to anyone looking for a character driven standalone. I will definitely be keeping an eye out for this author."}, {"userName": "Maya", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22343553-maya", "userReview": "ARC received in exchange for an honest review.I have to say that I'm very impressed with how this story turned out. I wasn't expecting it to be so interesting. The plot is a mixture of mystery, romance, fun and violence. And somehow that combination is what I like to see in my books. Yeah, I know. I'm weird... I've never read a book by this author and after reading this story, I think I'm going to enjoy reading her other books. Despite being YA (although some scenes were almost NA) this story would appeal also to more mature readers. Welcome to Gideon Davorin\u2019s Traveling Sideshow, where necromancy, magical visions, and pyrokinesis are more than just part of the act\u2026With this sentence the blurb sums up perfectly what you can expect from this story. Also the name of the story, Freeks, is quite accurate. But not only you get a story about people with special abilities, you also get a creature that will make your nightmares look like a joke. And what would a good story be without a murderous plot where the heroes have to fight for their lives, right? This story has it all. It's such a fantastic tempo and also great plot twists that make you want to read the story in one sitting. At least that's what happened to me. Mara and Gabe are at first sight you typical teenagers looking for a good time. But underneath, both hide some big secrets and both fear that that will come in between their new growing friendship. Add to that the mysterius attacks at the Traveling Sideshow and things get complicated real fast. Mara and Gabe's characters are obviously in the front of the story but I felt like all the characters got a good piece that told their story. You could fall in love with each character because you knew them so well. The same can be said about characters that make you dislike them. And there were a few of those. Just saying...I'm really happy I gave this story a chance. It's fun and entertainig till the end.

Hocking and MacKinnon Curse by J.A. Templeton), but that was my first time when I read like a maniac, devouring the world and it\u2019s characters within.Since then, I knew Hocking will be the one author I will have my eye on, eagerly waiting for new books to feed my appetite.Amanda Hocking did it again. She wrote yet another unputdownable book.It caught my attention, kept me on the edge of my sit, my eyes were flying through the pages and, before I even realized, I finished a book.My usual reading speed is 30 pages per hour, but with this book, it doubled (and it is not large print!).You can say it\u2019s because of simplicity of language, but I say it\u2019s because of interesting plot.This book was AMAZING!With unique characters, unforgetable plot placed in 1987, Freeks is the book that stands out from other pieces in paranormal genre.The story follows Mara, who works and travels with carnival. Her coworkers and family are paranormal, unusual or in contact with higher powers.When they come to state Louisiana, small town Caudry, one of their members dissapears.Not long after that, they discover that something/someone is after them, as well as their abilities start to weak.I love how smart Hocking was when outlining this story.She did her math well!By introducing us to new characters, making them unusual but still very relatable, she made us care for every single \u201cFreek\u201d, and then she sent that mysterious thing after them, making us, readers, afraid for them.She also wrote a good story line.There was an insta love, be aware, but I liked it.I also liked how main character, Mara, was 18 and her guy, Gabe, 19 (that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t mind things between them developing fast).I loved the setting.The vibe that small town gives was so well described.Also, I welcome the fact that the story was set in 1987. It made a lot sense to put it in that time, because technology was not developed back then (so there weren\u2019t mobile phones, and land lines weren\u2019t on every step).I can imagine that carnivals had more meaning back then, and pop culture references from that period also gave their charm to the story.One thing that also needs to be stressed out: there\u2019s a great representation of diversity.The only thing that confused me a bit (and I bet most people don\u2019t even pay attention to this kind of things) is the lack of Acknowledgments.Let me tell you, this book is hard to put down!Once you start reading it, it is very likely you will want to finish it in one sitting (but with almost 350 pages long book, that is hardly possible).I highly, highly recommend this one to paranormal lovers out there!\nRead this and more reviews on my blog: http://bookdustmagic.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Candace Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33995641-candace-robinson", "userReview": "I love the freaking 80\u2019s!

It's a decade book which is kinda cool- I love the 80's and honestly I would have liked even more references to it. But the general plot was kinda meh in my opinion. The writing wasn't bad - I actually liked the way Hocking described things. It was an easy read in that perspective and I felt like I was in the story. The beginning was pretty strong too- I felt connected to the MC right off the bat. She was pretty relatable and I liked that she was a little older. I liked Gabe's introduction too- but wow was that instalovey. The romance wasn't entirely weak- it was kinda cutesy, but nothing jaw dropping or full of feels. The general setting was cool though with the carnival and all.. and I even liked the town backdrop. I don't know, it isn't that there was a ton of things wrong with the book- I was just unimpressed with the whole town mystery and how all that played out.

Those in the sideshow are family to Mara with most having some sort of powers just like her mother's but Mara herself hasn't experienced any such thing yet herself. With the show really hurting for money when an offer that almost seems too good to be true comes along in a strange little town called Caudry, Louisiana they have to take the job. After arriving everyone begins to experience odd feelings and a dark vibe that seems to come from the town itself. Mara decides to take a walk their first night in town to get some air and finds herself meeting some of the local teenagers and makes a connection with Gabe. Mara doesn't want to admit to being a part of the show but Gabe also seems to carry his own secrets but the two begin spending time together. Meanwhile, back at the camp when the sun goes down the sideshow performers seem to be being stalked but some sort of animal. When people Mara loves continue to get hurt she needs to find the strength inside of her to fight whatever it is that is attacking her friends. Freeks is one that I had really high hopes for when I picked it up but it fell a bit short in my opinion. There are a few things I found that may have been done a bit better to have me really jumping up and down for this read. First being set in the 80s the book really lacked giving very many things throughout to show this decade as the setting which was a little disappointing. The pace also seemed very slow throughout the first three quarters or so as the story and relationships are being set up but then when all the true action and revelations happen it all seems so rushed at the end. The relationship between Mara and Gabe really seemed to be a bit lacking to me also. They meet and make out and the reader is supposed to believe that it must have been love at first sight I suppose. Mara herself definitely doesn't make a great role model with immediately making out with the first boy she met but she also seemed to contradict herself a bit while contemplating her frequents moves, she seems to have had other relationships but seems surprised Gabe would like her as if she hadn't had a boyfriend before.... just a bit back and forth with very little to get me invested in their story. In the end I still liked this one a bit as it reminds me of the campy horror movies that I've always been a fan of and it's a shame that with a few tweaks here and there I probably would have really loved the story.

This was a fun read, if not a bit clich\u00e9 and even a bit un-other. It wasn't anything too fantastical or unheard of and truly, while, it was good, wasn't anything that stood out and demanded to be taken notice of.

While their show boasts many of the usual attractions, what most folks don\u2019t realize is that many among Gideon\u2019s crew actually possess supernatural powers. For example, they have a telekinetic on staff who helps out with a lot of their magician\u2019s \u201ctricks\u201d. Their trapeze artist has abilities to manipulate the air around him so that he can never fall. Mara\u2019s own mother is a fortune teller who gains insights about her clients\u2019 lives by being able to commune with the dead. However, despite being surrounded by these powered individuals and being the daughter of one herself, Mara has no special abilities. She has sometimes wondered what it might be like to settle down and live like \u201cnormal\u201d people, but the carnival is the only family she has ever known, and even though the going can get tough sometimes, Mara loves her life and can\u2019t imagine it any other way.That is, until Gideon takes up a contract to set up camp in a small southern town named Caudry, and sparks fly between Mara and Gabe, a handsome local boy she meets at a party. Mara likes Gabe\u2014a lot\u2014and he seems to like her too. But how would he feel once he finds out she is a carnie? On the other hand\u2026does he even need to know? By this time in two weeks the sideshow will be on the road again and Mara would be on her way to their next destination; if the relationship is doomed to fail anyway, she sees no harm in withholding a few personal details, especially since Gabe seems to be keeping some secrets himself. Before long though, Mara has more pressing matters to worry about. One by one, members of Gideon\u2019s crew go missing or come under attack, savaged by some mysterious creature. Caudry also seems to be giving off some strange, bad vibes. The carnival came here in the hopes of making some extra revenue, but if the incidents keep up at this rate, Mara fears they\u2019ll run out of performers long before their contract is up.What I didn\u2019t realize before starting this book was how prominently it would be featuring the romantic side plot. While that by itself isn\u2019t always a negative, it is somewhat frustrating when you get teased all these other fascinating elements in the story, such as the sideshow\u2019s supernatural performers and all the peculiar goings-on happening around Caudry. I wanted more of the carnival life, more details on the backgrounds and personalities of the people working there, and more development into the mysteries of the town. But instead, most of what we got was Gabe, Gabe, and more Gabe. The story keeps shoving his and Mara\u2019s relationship down our throats and I can\u2019t help but think way too many pages were wasted in this area.Plus, after all this buildup to the grand finale where supposedly huge revelations would be revealed, the results were decidedly underwhelming. When all is said and done, the mystery felt much smaller than it was meant to be, and reasons are clear as to why: there\u2019s actually very little plot in this book. Like I said, most of it is padded by the romance, and I won\u2019t deny that this is somewhat disappointing. Hocking has set up something really cool here, creating a world where people with supernatural abilities live among us, then shining a spotlight on a traveling sideshow run by many of these special individuals. However, instead of exploring this aspect, she has decided to go with the tired and well-trod route of \u201cyet another YA romance\u201d while adding nothing too new or different to the formula. Big time missed opportunity here, which is what gripes me the most.In sum, Freeks had the potential to be more but ended up being rather average. Too much emphasis was placed on what was arguably a lackluster romance complete with stale dialogue and hints of insta-love, while regrettably the best and most interesting aspects of the story were underplayed. The book wasn\u2019t bad, but it wasn\u2019t great, just another ordinary middle-of-the-road YA fantasy novel.Audiobook Comments: I\u2019m glad that I listened to the audiobook version of Freeks, otherwise my rating might have been slightly lower. The performance by narrator Em Eldridge made up for some of the weaknesses of the story, as talented voice actors and actresses are able to do sometimes. For one thing, she\u2019s great at accents\u2014when a character\u2019s description states that they have a southern drawl, for example, that is exactly what she delivers. Her energy also gives life and personality to everyone in the story, especially Mara. I believe this is the first book I\u2019ve ever listened to Ms. Eldridge read, but I\u2019ll definitely be looking for more audiobooks narrated by her in the future."}, {"userName": "Jacqueline", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9659631-jacqueline", "userReview": "2.5/5 starsVideo Review: https://youtu.be/P275UbzIrCcWhen I was asked to be apart of the blog tour for this book I was excited since this sounded like something I would enjoy!

I thought the carnival sideshow aspect of this book was brilliant. I loved being in that world and surrounded the cast and crew of the sideshow. I wish there could have been more of the carnival in the book! The sideshow had a lot of interesting characters that I really enjoyed getting to know.I thought the author did a great job at describing the physical appearance of characters and the scenery. I could clearly see all the characters in my head and imagine what their abnormalities (if they had any) looked like. The paranormal elements of this book were a lot of fun to read about! I thought they added an enjoyable element to the book. The mystery that the author weaved into the plot kept me on my toes! The mystery added a fun and addictive element. There were some slow moments sprinkled throughout the story and predictable reveals, but I still enjoyed the overall plot of this book.The main character, Mara, was a solid character and I enjoyed reading from her point of view. There were a few times that I felt like she acted irrationally, but for the most part, she made reasonable decisions. I was glad that she wasn't a whiny or annoying character! I loved reading about her relationships with the different sideshow members. My favorite relationship was the one between Mara and Roxie. I thought they made great friends and I enjoyed their scenes together. I could read a whole book just about them going on adventures together!Gabe was a sweet and likable character. However, his romance with Mara was a let down for me. I think their personalities work really well together, but it wasn't developed in a way that I thought was believable. The romance felt like insta-love to me, and it I didn't like that very much. Within minutes of their first interaction, they started making out. I am not against the idea of instant chemistry or the idea of people just hooking up for the pleasure of it. However, this quick makeout lead into a fast romantic relationship that felt a bit lackluster. I would have preferred for their romance, if they were going to have one, to have been much slower paced. If the romance was more of a slow burn, then I know I would have been shipping Mara and Gabe HARD because their personalities mesh well.Overall, this was a unique and quick read. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves carnivals and mysteries. 3 / 5 FangsALSO, can we talk about how OBSESSED I am with the cover of this book?

It is more like a 3.5 star rating\u2026 but I stopped awarding half stars over a year ago now. Even though I was tempted to go back on my decision just for the sake of this book, I\u2019m not going to. Because while it was good, and had its moments, it was a bit of a stretch to say it was wonderful. I did enjoy reading it though. Allow me to elaborate\u2026The novel was set in a circus, where a lot of the members had powers. I really liked the idea of that \u2013 of the carnival truly being magical and having its own intrigue to it. I think the author handled the atmosphere really well too. I really felt like it was a circus, and the aspect of living in a small traveling home, which never stayed in the same place for too long. Also, there is an eerie undercurrent to the whole story which has to do with the plot. I really felt it, and liked that it was so present.However, I had some issues with the main character. I did like Mara a lot, and I think she was a very brave and fun character to read about. She also really wants to stick up for her friends and family, and truly shows her loyalty to them. But\u2026 she could be quite hypocritical. There is a romance interest in this novel, and she worries about letting him know she is a member of the circus because he might treat her differently because of it. I understand that. And it must be difficult if that reaction has happened countless times before. But despite Gabe only being understanding of everything, she doesn\u2019t let herself trust him\u2026 and that bothered me a little. Or she would expect something from him, but if the situation flipped she didn\u2019t understand how/why he would expect the same of her. Which bothered me again.But the romance in itself was pretty sweet. It was fairly clean, and not too intense. The best way I can put it is nice. It was a nice romance.The pace of the novel was slow, but not in a bad way. Never was I bored, or wanted to put down the novel. More so, I felt at the same level of suspense all the time, and I just steadily kept reading my way through. I think the atmosphere was what really kept me turning the pages, and wanting to know how things would be resolved.Although\u2026 the ending feel mediocre? It was over all too quickly. There were consequences, but I feel like it was rushed. We never got to feel the full effect of those consequences and what they meant for the characters, because the story finished pretty soon afterwards. The darkness and creepiness all came to a peak, but it crumbled down far too quickly for me.I really liked the descriptions and how it added to the imagery I felt in my mind. On the other hand, I did notice one word being used quite a lot\u2026 \u2018flesh.\u2019 I don\u2019t know about you, but that word is not the nicest description of things? But the author used it as if it was. He touched the soft flesh of her stomach\u2026 or her mother patted the flesh of her arm\u2026 or his flesh was torn from being attacked\u2026 flesh this, flesh that. I\u2019ve just seen that word a little too much :DA slow and steady story, but enjoyable in its own right.This review and others can be found on the book blog Olivia's Catastrophe: http://olivia-savannah.blogspot.nl/20..."}, {"userName": "Emer ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4629647-emer", "userReview": "I could never seem to get lost in the story of this book so I think sadly it was just not to my taste.

It has poor reviews, a not great overall rating, and people seemed to be really underwhelmed. But I LOVE books involving the Circus (this caused me to buy THREE more) so I bought it and went in with no expectations.This made me realize that a lot of books marketed as YA mystery/creepy books (this, and the Asylum series by Madeleine Roux are the 2 I can think of) make people expect so much and they are usually let down. I've realized that if you read these just expecting to have fun you will be way less disappointed. People expect too much out of these types of stories sometimes.I just adored this book. It took me a while to read because of work, but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute I was reading this book. I liked the writing, the voice of the main character was so strong, and I loved the side characters. The diversity in this book is on point too. Two interracial children, a half indian main character and a half hispanic love interest. There was LGBT representation as well. Just a well rounded cast of characters and I really enjoyed it.The plot itself was great. Honestly the setting of a circus made my heart soar, I just love this setting, but I enjoyed the southern US town too. The plot fit in really nicely with the setting and characters and I think that everything at the end had a really solid conclusion.I recommend it, but I say don't expect much. Most people seem to get let down from this book and I think it's because they just expect a lot more than this book can provide."}, {"userName": "Uma  \u2665 Books.Bags.Burgers.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59490976-uma-books-bags-burgers", "userReview": "(A huge thanks to Pan Macmillan India for sending me this book in exchange for an honest review.)\n CHARACTERS \nI must say that while the protagonist is Mara, my favourite character from the book is Roxie. She's spunky and sweet and her pyrokinetic powers are wicked cool! I found her the most well written of all the characters and thoroughly enjoyed her friendship with Mara.Mara is an interesting character. She\u2019s been with the travelling circus since she was a toddler and longs for a more permanent home. This causes her to have a fascination with houses. I enjoyed how she was a strong heroine and was definitely not a damsel in distress. There was one thing about her that I didn\u2019t like. She mentions that she has flings and romances with guys while she\u2019s travelling and most times leaves before they find out who she is. That is so not cool. Gabe is quite a charming gentleman with a bad boy streak and I enjoyed reading about him. He has an air of mystery around him that thickens as the plot moves forward.One thing that turned me off was the insta-love between Mara and Gabe. It was way too fast and so sudden. I think the story would have worked wonderfully even if Mara and Gabe had been friends or maybe crushes.I LOVED, absolutely LOVED the diverse people who are a part of the travelling circus. While the diversity itself isn\u2019t a huge part of the story, I quite enjoyed it.\n PLOT \nThe plot has it all \u2013 mystery, horror and romance. Despite a few predictable twists, I quite enjoyed how the plot turned out. The plot made sure that the book was absolutely un-putdownable. The circus background and the deliciously creepy setting adds so much character to the plot and really makes it \u2018work\u2019. I did feel the ending was a bit rushed but somehow it kind of worked for the book.\n WRITING \nThe writing is fast paced and simple. It was neither overtly descriptive nor was it boring. I think part of what kept me turning the pages hungrily was the simple but wonderful writing. I must mention here that I\u2019ve read Switched and Wake by the author and somehow didn\u2019t connect with the writing but I found the writing to be so much more better in Freeks. Also I absolutely loved the Tarot card art in the book that added to the creepy quality of the story.\n WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THE BOOK \n- The plot- The creepy atmosphere- The diversity- Roxie- The writing- The circus setting\n WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THE BOOK \n- The insta love- The fact that the ending was rushed\n CONCLUSION \nFreeks is a quick and exciting read with an eerie atmospheric setting that fits the plot. It has it's small flaws but ultimately makes for a wonderful read filled with interesting and diverse characters."}, {"userName": "Shannon (leaninglights)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10961933-shannon-leaninglights", "userReview": "There were a few joy moments but overall, this was very lackluster to me.

Totally gets the vibe of the book. Then again, all Hocking's books have amazing covers. I'm a big fan of hers. When I was asked to be part of the blog tour, I jumped at the chance. And I hadn't even read the book yet.\u00a0I knew I would love it. I just knew.Let me just dive into the premise so you can see how cool this book sounded to me...So Mara travels around with her mom and her mom's boyfriend Gideon during the spring of 1987 (I was four years old, btw, so I feel really old now). They are a group of carnival workers and \"freaks.\" However, the freaks in this show aren't exactly just run of the mill people. When the money gets low, they load into the Winnebago and travel to Louisiana where a friend and old sideshow member suggest they can make some major money. And the one thing Mara and the other carnival workers need is money....even though once they enter the town, they can almost feel a creepy presence in the town.Mara mainly just helps her friends and family as she has no gift. Her mother is a Necromancer and can speak to the dead. Gideon can see the future. One friend is a pyrokinetic whiz, and another can self-heal. They are perfect for Gideon's Traveling Sideshow...but Mara has no gift.\u00a0While in the town, Mara meets Gabe, a sexy townie. And though their relationship cannot last, as she is only passing through, Mara and Gabe get closer than they should.Then the attacks start.A mysterious beast is attacking the carnival worriers. No one can get a good look at it, but the workers' lives are in danger. However, they can't leave because their contract stipulates they stay for so many days. And they are flat broke. So they do what they can and try to be wary. Mara is a little distracted by Gabe, who seems to have secrets of his own. One thing for sure: she doesn't want Gabe to know she works for the carnival.But as more people get hurt, the people of Gideon's Traveling Sideshow start to wonder: what is going on in this small town in Louisiana? And why are the carnival workers a target?\u00a0Could Gabe be a part of the evil that lurks in this town?\nIs It Classroom-Appropriate?Hocking's books aren't always PG (the Wake series has some steamy scenes and some swearing, but if you read the series you would understand why). But this one is totally clean. I can't really see much use for this particular book in the classroom, but it would definitely make a good recommeended read for outside class reading. There is nothing offensive that I wouldn't want my students to read. And just because there isn't something that I can see, others might find a use for Freeks in the classroom: there is a theme of prejudice against anything \"different.\" And I loved the 80s references.Age RangeI will once again have to guess because Freeks isn't listed on Lexile.com (they really need to include more in their book catalogue). I would recommend it for ages 13 and up, though I think mature 12 year olds could read it as well. There isn't anything really too inappropriate beside one scene with innuendo about a sleepover...but it's implied. So I'm comfortable saying 13 and up, but also it depends on a case-by-case basis for younger readers. I'm more cautious than others, so for some I might be a little conservative. If that's the case, then I would recommend giving it a read first before handing it off to anyone younger than 13.End Result:I liked Freeks a lot. I wish it was a series. I wouldn't mind learning more about the freak show and the people in it. Alas, it is a standalone, so I give it \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606. Which mean...\nFor reference, see my rating system, see my blog.Oh...but I'm not done yet!

Your characters are sent into the Hunger Games. Who wins?\u00a0If it\u2019s just the characters from FREEKS, and only one could win, I would put my money on Luka or maybe Roxie. Luka because he can heal from injuries, which gives him a crazy advantage, but Roxie is smart and she\u2019s a survivor. Plus, she has the power of pyrokinesis, which I think I would come in handy in a battle to the death.2. What do you listen to while you write? Or do you prefer silence?\u00a0I almost always listen to music when I write, unless I\u2019m writing a really difficult scene. Sometimes the silence helps me focus, but most of the time, I prefer music. For FREEKS, I got to make a really fun 80s playlist, so I especially enjoyed working to that.3. What is the most embarrassing thing you\u2019ve looked up in the name of research \u2013 or what do you think the government has maybe flagged you for?There are sooo many things. For FREEKS, I had to do fun stuff like, \u201cWhat does a dead body smell like?\u201d and \u201cHow much blood can a human lose?\u201d And then after those macabre questions, I did a bunch of googling on fireflies and tarot cards. My search history when I\u2019m working can be pretty exciting like that.\u00a04. What was your favorite part of writing FREEKS?I love Southern Gothics and I love pulpy 80s horror movies, so I was excited to be able incorporate those things in FREEKS. But my favorite part was actually Mara and Gabe. I think they complement each other well, and it was fun writing their banter and flirtations.5. Which actor/actress would you like to see playing your main characters from FREEKS?For Mara, I envisioned Cassie Steele from the start. I used to be a hardcore Degrassi fan, and I loved Cassie Steele on that. For Gabe, I like Ryan Guzman. I saw him in a Jennifer Lopez movie, and I was like, \u201cYep. That could be Gabe.\u201d6. Do you have a special time to write or how is your day structured?\u00a0I usually write between 11 am and 7 pm. I\u2019ve tried to write earlier in the day and have more of a 8-5 type schedule, but I am not a morning person. My brain just doesn\u2019t want to work much before noon.7. Do you aim for a set amount of words/pages per day?I usually have a goal in mind before I start writing, but it varies. Some days, it\u2019s slow going and I hope to get at least 500 words out. Other days, I fly through with thousands of words. So it depends on where I\u2019m at in the book, when it\u2019s due, and how I\u2019m feeling about the whole thing.8. When you develop your characters, do you already have an idea of who they are before you write or do you let them develop as you go?With all my main characters, I have a really good idea of who they are, and it\u2019s just a matter of showing that to the readers. With the side characters, they tend to be rather one-dimensional, and they grow into the story as they\u2019re needed.9. How did writing Freeks differ from your writing your previous novels?\u00a0FREEKS was the first thing I had written in awhile that was started out just for me. For most of the past ten years, I have been writing my books with the intention of publishing them, with the audience and readers and trends in mind. I think I had gotten a little burnt out on trying to make everyone happy (mostly because it is impossible to please all readers all the time), and I just wanted to write something that for the sake of writing it.\u00a0And that turned out to be a gothic love story about a teenage girl travelling with a band of misfits in the 1980s. It was a very cathartic writing experience for me, and it reminded me of exactly why I loved writing in the first place \u2013 I love getting lost in the world, with the characters.10. If Freeks had a theme song what would it be?Either \u201cHush\u201d by Limousines or \u201cHead Over Heels\u201d by Tears For Fears.11. Can you please tell us a little bit about Freeks and where you got the inspiration to write it?I was going through a rough patch, creatively speaking, and so I just sat back and tried to think of my favorite and what I loved most that I would want to write about.When I was a kid, I used to get old books at garage sales all the time, and I distinctly remember getting Cycle of the Werewolf by Stephen King and a few old V. C. Andrews novels, (I LOVE THESE!! - Steph)\u00a0which are pulpy Southern Gothic-esque novels. I also watched The Lost Boys and Pretty in Pink over and over again (I think I literally ruined the old VHS of The Lost Boys from watching it too much).So I basically threw all those things together in a soup, and I picked apart the things I liked and wanted to explore more. That became a travelling sideshow in the 80s stopping Louisiana, where a supernatural monster is afoot, and a girl from the wrong side of the tracks who is smith with a local boy with secrets of his own.12. Freeks is full of many amazingly talented characters and I imagine it was really fun to create some of them, but which one was your favorite and why?Mara and Gabe are my obvious favorites, since they\u2019re the main characters because I was drawn to them and their story the most. Both of them of them have complex feelings about family and personal identity, and their instant chemistry was fun to write.But I think Gideon \u2013 the namesake and head of sideshow \u2013 was actually the biggest surprise, which made him fun in a different way. In the original outlines of the story, he was much a different character \u2013 very one-note and cruel \u2013 but he completely changed and evolved as I was writing. \u00a013. The book is based off of a type of traveling circus that is full of many mysterious acts. If you were to attend a Freekshow, which act would you want to see most?My favorites are usually the acrobatics, but I think if I attended Gideon Davorin\u2019s Traveling Sideshow, I would be most excited to see Gideon\u2019s magic act. With his skills and knowledge, I think it would be a really amazing show.14. What do you hope readers will take away from FREEKS after reading it?With some of my other novels, I deal with heavy themes like life and death, identity, honor, mortality, classism, and family. And while I do definitely touch on those themes in FREEKS, I mostly wrote it as an escape for myself, and that\u2019s what I hope it is for other readers. Life can be hard and frustrating, and I just wanted to write a fun book that readers could get lost in for awhile.15. What is something people would be surprised to know about you?Probably how chronically shy I am. Writing is a weird profession, because a good 90% of it is perfect for introverts \u2013 you sit alone by yourself and make up imaginary friends to go on adventures. But the last 10% \u2013 which involves introducing the whole word to your imaginary friends \u2013 is the most exciting and rewarding part, but it\u2019s also the most difficult when you\u2019re as shy as I am.\u00a0\nSo that's it, guys! Hope you enjoyed reading my review and learning a little about Amanda Hocking and Freeks!Seriously...check it out.\u00a0I leave you with the awesome Pan Macmillan cover, that I think is beautiful in its own way:\nHappy Reading, y'all!

The carnival is broke and matters only seem to be getting worse. Until an unexpected offer leads them to a tiny town with promises of money that could change their lives.

But they decide to make the best of it, while ignoring the weight of doom.Mara goes wondering through the town and spots him. A gorgeous guy that meets her eye and holds it. She's suddenly drawn to him like he is to her. Love at first sight. The carnival can wait as she falls into the claws of a man with secrets. She also has a few of her own.The carnival becomes a huge success, but at dire costs. Things are lurking in the night. Deadly things that are on the hunt for flesh and power.As things go from successful to frightening in the matter hours. They decide to stick it out to collect the life changing money. As performers are being picked off left and right, they must decide what's right for them in the long run. All while Mara is falling madly in love with Gabe. That darker deadly presence will haunt their lives and dreams until there is no one left.I love this book. Creepy carnivals and weird love are near and dear to my heart. What really stopped this from being five stars was a part near the end. This fight sequence of saving performers lives and how it ends. There was something just too far fetched for me and the abrupt end to it all. The story in between that was mesmerizing.

Yet when Mara meets a cute boy at a party she stumbles upon, she can't help but catch feelings. The only problem is that no one ever falls for the girl working at the carnival. But dark forces are found in the new town, and they're attacking the carnival and everyone Mara loves. Mara isn't the usual type of main character I fall in love with, but she has something about her that you can relate to and understand, she almost feels like a little sister. Mara has been travelling with the carnival for a long time, so long that the workers feel like family to her. Mara's love for her carnival family comes out when they are being threatened and I absolutely love it. I love how her bonds are so strong with everyone, and how she's so protective of her people. She's just a very likeable character, not only by other characters but by the reader as well. She is only 19 but she's so responsible and hard working she almost feels older, she just makes for a wonderful role model. I really loved Gabe, and the romance in this book. The scenes between Mara and Gabe are really cute and romantic. They are perfect together and every scene with the two of them was a pleasure to read.The storyline was so close to being perfect. I loved the beginning and middle of the book. The book had a good pace going, the action was building up, everything was going perfectly... then the climax happened.~ Mild spoilers ahead ~When we hit the climax of the story, and Mara kills the beast, it almost seemed too easy. This demon was described in a way that it was so hard to kill and the townsfolk couldn't kill it for decades, and then all of a sudden Mara shoots it with a magic crossbow and its dead.~ End of spoiler ~ I would have given this book 5 stars if it wasn't for the climax being so... easy. But everything that happened after the climax went back to the wonderful style of writing I liked in the beginning.Overall, I would still really recommend this book. It's slightly different than anything I've read before in the paranormal world of books. The characters are great and it's so close to being a perfect book.

This story is set in the 80s. Mara is 19 years old. Although she was more new adult age, she is more young adult in her maturity. Mara is a genuinely likeable person. She is everything I would imagine a 19 year old in her situation would be. Mara is a good friend to her \u201cfamily\u201d in the sideshow.Her love interest Gabe was also a great character. They meet and have a genuine \u201clike\u201d for each other right away. I imagine the newness of each other is what drew them together. They also seemed to be living the dream way the other one wished for. Mara and Gabe get along so well, I really liked them together. Things between them happened really fast. I am more a fan of slow burn type romances, but this relationship worked for me.There is a genuine mystery happening in this town. I won\u2019t talk too much about it because it was what really kept me turning pages. Instead, I want to tell you that the descriptive writing in this story will put you right there. I could easily imagine the whole scenes and the characters.The bad news: There was a lack of emotion in some of the characters. There wasn\u2019t enough outrage in a certain scene. There also wasn\u2019t too much of the show itself. No acrobats? I wanted the author to describe them! The mystery in the story ended pretty abruptly. I seriously wish this were a series, the fact that it is not is so disappointing. There was much more that could have been explored in this world.All in all, this was a fun read in an awesome setting. I really enjoyed this read. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fantasy and paranormal reads."}, {"userName": "Kayla Ritenour (In Between The pages)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14688135-kayla-ritenour-in-between-the-pages", "userReview": "So for me at least, this book took me a while to read.I know I know 5 days isn't that long you say. but your talking to someone who can finish a book in 1 or 2 tips most of the time.this week just got away from me starting classes, work, and helping my mom as she recovers. and so my reading time just wasn't there. and that's why sadly I didn't have updates as I read like I normally do.but this book ah-mah-gawd!!!!!it was so so good.I really wasn't sure Amanda could write a book that bested her Trylle/Kanin series, for me, but this book did just that.this supernatural, a tad spooky, and yet totally thrilling world just blew me away.and it was the characters too. I can't even pick out just one in particular I found myself adoring more then the rest. It was literally ALL of them.I tried not to find out too much what this book was about before reading it, just because I find the surprise of it all to be even more fun.so once I really started understanding the plot I spent a ridiculous amount of time shouting out \"No way!\" (but in a good way of course)I mean every time I thought I had a lock on something the story would take a sudden shift I haven't expected. (I did have a couple things right though, so I'm still proud of my book mojo hehe)and just a while book about this awesome old school side show was just a brilliant idea. it was different and so much fun seeing all these people do this spectacular things no one else can.and I loved the comradery everyone showed. you knew that if something happened to any of the characters that the others would have their backs.it was just a brilliant story, and I've got my fingers crossed this will be just the forat in a series... please please please let this be a new series!!!!full review to come....but for now I definitely give FREEKS *****5 STARS*****"}, {"userName": "Emily (Obsessed Reader)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6145238-emily-obsessed-reader", "userReview": "The whole circus/sideshow aspect was really fun. The romance was your typical YA romance, and I didn't expect much more than that going in. It was creepy, fun, and interesting. I always enjoy Hocking's stories. You just have to go into them knowing that the writing style is typical to YA. But the storylines are always usually pretty unique, as was this one. I really like the idea of this being a standalone, but I definitely wouldn't mind to travel more with the circus and these characters if it becomes a series."}], "description": "In a world of magical visions and pyrokinesis, Mara just wants to have a normal life.
