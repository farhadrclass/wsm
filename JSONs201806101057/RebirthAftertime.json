Practically every second book I see on the shelves is either a Twilight rip-off (if PNR) or a Hunger Games rip-off (if dystopian). Even adult books suddenly seem to be trying out the YA formula, with some sex tossed in. Not cool, you guys, not cool. Sophie, on the other hand, does not shy away from the hard facts. Despite writing for an imprint that is known to go soft on realism and heavy on romance, she has managed to create a hard, gritty heroine fighting the ravages of a hard, gritty world. Cass Dollar has been creating a fairly contented life for her little family, ever since she managed to rescue her daughter from the Convent. With Smoke's support, life for Cass has become easier, if not the utopia of happiness one might wish for. But all that changes when Smoke discovers that the school where he first met Cass has been burnt down by the Rebuilders and most of the adults, including his former lover, Nora, have been killed. Dor's daughter Sammi was kidnapped and taken to the Rebuilder HQ in Colima, a fact that makes Dor determined to enter the compound and rescue his daughter. But it is Smoke's determination to avenge his dead friends that turns Cass' life upside down, as he slips away from her and Ruthie without warning, leaving her with the devastation of her carefully constructed life, and the sting of betrayal strong in her newly-opened heart.Resolved to leave the slowly-disintegrating society of the Box, Cass decides to accompany Dor on his search for his daughter, hoping to find a better life for Ruthie and herself. But the Cass who was so filled with purpose while searching for her child is little in evidence, as she battles her self-destructive urges and tries to fortify her heart yet again so that nobody can hurt her as much as Smoke did with his abandonment. Cass is a great character, scary, bitter yet strangely vulnerable. Used to using her body as a means to achieve her ends, be it oblivion, temporary forgetfulness, punishment or pleasure, she finds herself reverting to old habits, losing the precious, tender part of herself that had begun to slowly unfurl during her life with Smoke. Littlefield puts her balls of steel to good use in this instalment of the Aftertime novels. Bereft and betrayed, Cass decides to punish herself for opening up and loving Smoke by using Dor's body. The tricks of a lifetime come in handy as she seduces Dor against his will, punishing herself as well as him. The sex scenes in this book are raw, but hardly erotic. Sex is a weapon for Cass, a currency she has traded in all her life, and Littlefield makes no bones about her callous approach to using her body as a bargaining tool and a fortification against her wounded heart. The other plot device I admire Littlefield for using is Ruthie. Dystopian and urban fantasy novels about single mothers are rare. Even rarer are the novels where the protagonist is the single mother of a very small child. And rarest of all, in fact unique in my experience, are novels about single mothers with small children who do not conveniently dump said children in a conveniently safe corner while they go about their adventures. But Ruthie is an integral part of this story. The reader worries as much for her as for Cass; her personality is revealed slowly, and she unfurls like a little scared flower during the course of the book. Just as with the adult characters, one is eager to find out what secrets she is carrying, and what horrors she has faced.And now, for the bad news:Sophie Littlefield's biggest strength lies in her ability to plot tight, fast-paced, action filled thrillers. Both Banished and Aftertime were heart-poundingly quick reads. Unfortunately, Rebirth is much slower, and that is not a change for the better. Large tracts of this book are filled with description and character internalization. Cass's endless and overtly descriptive reflections about her past, her surroundings and the apocalyptic society she now lives in slow the book down unnecessarily. At one point, I had to literally force myself to continue, and that is never a good sign.However, I'm glad I did, because the climax is stunningly, superbly spectacular, in the best Littlefield tradition. All the drama and action and adrenaline-inducing highs that were missing from the first part of the book come rushing back to leave you gasping for breath and begging for more. This story doesn't end on a cliffhanger, precisely, but it is still very obviously a middle book in a series. There are huge unanswered questions left hanging - what happened to Ruthie at the Convent? What is Smoke's big secret? Is this really a love triangle I'm seeing forming here? Where are they going to settle? How are they going to deal with the Beaters? Basically, the story arc within the book - the rescue of Sammi, is completed, but the overarching questions still continue to niggle at the mind.All in all, I didn't find the same whole-hearted enjoyment in this book that I did with Aftertime. However, it was still absorbing for the most part, and the climax was everything one could desire. I will definitely be reading the next novel in the series, not just because I'm a Sophie Littlefield fangirl, but also because I genuinely enjoy this series and want to know what happens next!"}, {"userName": "Michelle, the Bookshelf Stalker  Queen of the Undead", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3039709-michelle-the-bookshelf-stalker-queen-of-the-undead", "userReview": "[to take a walk  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Regina", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3104032-regina", "userReview": "[ Add on to that, this man left her without even saying good-bye.

It's more obvious when it's joy, hope or love. But just as beautiful, in their own way, are the wrenching feelings Sophie Littlefield elicits in her dystopian Aftertime trilogy. In this second installment, we see grief, despair, and hopelessness. It's heartbreaking, but you can't look away. You don't want to look away. You keep reading, refusing to relinquish the hope that after the darkness will come the dawn; after the misery, we'll be rewarded with some kind of triumph.Cass has created a makeshift home and family in the trading center known as the Box. She has reunited with her daughter Ruthie and she has allowed herself to fall in love with Smoke. But the fragile happiness she has found is short-lived. When Smoke gets word that the Rebuilders have killed many of the refugees in the place where he once lived, he goes on a vengeance mission; one likely to lead to his death. And he doesn't even say goodbye. Cass decides to leave the Box with its founder, Dor, as he goes in search of his daughter Sammi, who was taken by the raiding Rebuilders.Cass is devastated by Smoke's abandonment. She blames herself for allowing him access to her heart. She acts out, trying to harden herself. She makes reckless choices that you can see like a train wreck a mile away. And maybe that will alienate some readers. To me, it just made me see her as more broken. She is trying to rebuild the wall around herself that Smoke had penetrated, and somehow manages to drag Dor into her warped decisions in the process. The book follows Cass, Dor and Ruthie as they infiltrate the Rebuilder camp and learn more about the group's nefarious plans.I suppose from this review, you'd never know this book is about a post-apocalyptic world, overrun by zombies. That's because, to me, that's just a backdrop to watch the lives of these characters unfold. To watch Cass break and rebuild. To watch Ruthie heal and grow. To watch Dor unwittingly shed his cloak of solitude and allow Cass in. And, of course, to see the human condition when people are stripped of the trappings of modern life... from the screwed-up ideals of the Rebuilders to the bandits who accost unwary travelers to the heartbroken mother who refuses to accept the fact that her son is dying. It's absolutely mesmerizing. And hauntingly beautiful. Even more powerful than its predecessor. 5 stars. *ARC Provided by NetGalley"}, {"userName": "AH", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3255548-ah", "userReview": "What an ending....May contain mild spoilers for the first book in the series - Aftertime. If you haven't read Aftertime, what are you waiting for?When I finished reading Aftertime, I was left with a sense of hope. Cass, Ruthie, and Smoke were a family. The world was beginning to show signs of Rebirth: young seedlings were starting to sprout. Good things don\u2019t last too long in this world that was destroyed by biological warfare and a disease that turned most of the population into flesh eating Beaters or zombies. Smoke leaves on a mission of vengeance without saying goodbye to Cass. Dor hears that the Rebuilders have attacked the Library settlement and they have taken his teenage daughter Sammi. Dor sets out on his own mission to rescue Sammi. Cass, heartbroken by Smoke\u2019s departure, accompanies Dor on her own mission \u2013 to find Smoke.Humanity has changed for the worse. The Rebuilders are a prime example of a cult-like totalitarian regime that forced its citizens to comply with their philosophy. When their sinister agenda was revealed, I was disgusted. All the main characters in this book are damaged in some way. Smoke has a secret that he revealed only to Dor. Dor also has his issues. Cass brought a lot of baggage from her life Before. She was a recovering alcoholic and had been sexually abused by her stepfather.I was a little disappointed by Cass in this book, although I believe that she was portrayed accurately by the author. Cass has this ability to do anything that is necessary in order to achieve her goals. It seems to work for her, but it made me wonder about her morality. The story is well paced and there are many exciting situations, as well as a few explosions. If you like post-apocalyptic books, add this series to your reading list.Review posted on Badass Book Reviews."}, {"userName": "Leea", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2181877-leea", "userReview": "[the Delta, not far from where I live in fact or at least from what's described I think it's not far.

An absolutely wonderful piece of speculative fiction.Review:Yes indeed, Ms. Littlefield does it again! In this sequel to the amazing Aftertime, a fascinating premise and excellent narrative execution is built upon and expanded. This book is certainly not its predecessor, taking a different tone and focus but absolutely shining in every aspect.This is one of those books for which you\u2019ll not want to know many details going into the story. As such, describing the book very difficult, since it\u2019s so heavily centered around one major occurrence. The themes around which the plot revolves include abandonment and revenge; to know who\u2019s experiencing or partaking in these activities might be considered a spoiler. So, I\u2019ll stick with the general bits: we\u2019re back to following Cass Dollar from book one, and as before, we\u2019re treated to an in-depth look at her experiences and inner turmoil. But in addition to that, there\u2019s much more focus on others in the cast; in fact, there are several narrative shifts between characters. This is not as much Cass\u2019s book as it is her loved ones\u2019\u2026which is fine, considering it seems as though the series is shifting toward a broader, more epic scope as it goes on.I love it when a storyteller can draw out the most intense, realistic, and honest emotion from fantastical situations or unfamiliar settings. Littlefield does just that and more. Her characters are raw. True. Loved, as evidenced by the care taken in crafting them. There is no simple \u201cangst\u201d but rather a complex assessment of human behaviors and emotions in the face of devastating loss and destruction, of a drastic redefinition of society itself. Even as the dark reality of certain situations makes you want to look away, the story compels you to continue. It\u2019s the very definition of \u201cdarkly enchanting.\u201d Survival is never a given in this world, nor are tidy resolutions. But the thread of hope maintains, leaving the reader to really want to follow the cast through the hardest moments.Reading this book has only further solidified by affection and excitement for this trilogy. Even if I read the third and final book (to be released early 2012) and decide I don\u2019t like it (highly doubt I would, but for the sake of argument), I\u2019ll always hold Rebirth and its predecessor Aftertime as some of my favorite books of all time."}, {"userName": "All Things Urban Fantasy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2732683-all-things-urban-fantasy", "userReview": "Review courtesy of All Things Urban FantasyREBIRTH is part The Walking Dead, part The Road, and part something totally new and engrossing. AFTERTIME threw us into a chaotic post apocalyptic world along with Cass and let us experience the first horrors that eventually destroyed life as we know it. As the title suggests, REBIRTH is a new beginning both for Cass and those who survived the zombie apocalypse, a beautiful and baleful story of horror and hope.Like every good dystopian book, there is plenty in REBIRTH that will incite. We met the Rebuilders briefly in AFTERTIME, but in REBIRTH, we are fully immersed into the totalitarian regime that is forcibly seizing control of the new world. The evils unearthed within their command center are sobering and shocking. Littlefield writes so expressively, so vividly, that she wrings every drop of rage possible out of her readers. And just when you think the situation can\u2019t get any worse, that the depths of human depravity have been well and truly plumbed, there is something far worse to come.Despite those heavy scenes, which are prevalent, it\u2019s the characters that make them bearable. More than bearable. The Aftertime world is meant to be terrible, but the characters, the relationships, they are what make it worth fighting for. They make every small victory into a triumph that fuels all our hope. It\u2019s an amazingly well balanced thing and one that Littlefield excels at. Equally well written are the characters. Cass is a woman driven by compulsions. Before, it was her addictions. Aftertime, it was reclaiming her daughter. In REBIRTH, she is once again seeking to rescue someone she loves and carve out whatever possible future this world can offer. 90% of REBIRTH is told from Cass\u2019s POV, but there are a few chapters each given to Dor and his daughter Sammy, both of which added a new level of perception to Aftertime that Cass alone couldn\u2019t. Given the way REBIRTH ends, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if additional POVs make it into the next book. You need to read this book. You will be disturbed, you will be compelled, and you will not be the same. I died a tiny bit when I read the last page and found out that the next book in the Aftertime series, called HORIZON, won\u2019t be published until February 2012. That\u2019s a long time to wait for something so good. Check out the book trailer for a peek at the cover.Sexual Content:A couple sex scenes. Attempted rape.

Smoke, Cass, and Ruthie have been a family in the Box since Ruthie was rescued from the convent. Smoke is head of security and Cass grows food and medicine in her garden. All is as good as things get in Aftertime, until Smoke gets news that the school where Cass met him has been captured by Rebuilders. Smoke is set on revenge and leaves to kill the Rebuilders involved without saying good-bye to Cass. Cass feels abandoned and betrayed, and the wall of mistrust that Smoke crumbled around Cass is rebuilt stronger than ever. Although I was angry with Smoke for leaving and angry at Cass for not fighting him more, ultimately I understood that Smoke had to leave or he would not be the hero he is. Not able to stay in the Box without Smoke, Cass takes Ruthie and joins Dor on a mission to rescue his daughter, Sammie, who Cass met from her short stay in the library. I was a little surprised by the way things played out in this book. This book was even darker than Aftertime and it gave even better insight to what people will be driven to do in order to not only survive, but to save their loved ones.

OH GOD. *insertrandomWTFgifhere*I have NO words to describe my emotions while reading this book. On two separate occasions, I said \"WTF is this shit?!\" to my SO and put the book down. But the book, despite all the issues I had with it, is incredibly readable, which is why I managed to crawl toward the last final pages, which seemed, after the relative slow pace of the first half, to rocket to a conclusion. (Spoilers abound!)My first issue with Rebirth:Smoke leaves her. AFTER HE HEARS THE SCHOOL WAS TAKEN OVER BY REBUILDERS. I apologize about the caps, but I feel so effing strong about this. Anyways, he leaves her to go check it out for himself. After all, he was at this shelter for a while before he met Cass and his ex-lover was also there. CASS RESENTS THAT HE GOES.WTF is this? She hates that he's going. Wha? In what universe does this not make her incredibly selfish? She resents the fact that he slept with someone before her and the book keeps mentioning the fact that Cass wishes his ex (forgot her name...Lila? Lydia?) never existed. My second issue:She decides to go after him. This isn't necessarily bad in itself, but she decides to take something with her. HER THREE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER.At this point, I put the book down and looked at SO. \"It's been a long time since I wanted to throw a book against a wall.\" \"That bad, hm?\" \"You have no idea.\" And I really didn't want to feel this way. But, again let me say it, IN WHAT UNIVERSE is it OKAY to take a toddler through dangerous territory just to find some guy who said he was going to come back? My third issue:She sleeps with Dor. Oh wait, no, she FORCES herself on Dor. In the worst possible way. This happens multiple times and this was the other point where I actually PUT THE BOOK DOWN, said \"I'm not reading this shit anymore.\" ...I did. But only because the writing was pretty compelling. Oh, but how I wished I didn't. I had nightmares about this whole post-apocalyptic scenario, fueled by Starbucks Doubleshot, a B-complex vitamin, and an empty stomach.

She is not a heroine I envy or want to be, but I love her strengths. She has will power, drive and a desire to see her daughter live and thrive in a world where that no longer seems like a possibility. Cass has been down many difficult roads in life, she has filled her life with numerous poor decisions and yet she still goes on. Rebirth picks up shortly after the end of Aftertime. Cass has her daughter Ruthie back. She is living at the Box with her lover Smoke, life is going extremely well considering all of the circumstances. All is well until the school where Cass initially met Smoke, was attacked and burned by the Rebuilders. The women and children are taken to Colima, the Rebuilder\u2019s central command compound. Sammi, Dor's daughter is among the survivors that have been taken away.This is a series that must be read in order. There was little to no rehashing in these pages. Rebirth is a whole new adventure. Smoke leaves Cass at the Box to go on a vengeance mission. Feeling betrayed she leaves the Box with Dor on the quest to rescue his daughter. After reading Aftertime I was left with a feeling that the Rebuilders most likely had their own agenda in the scheme of things in this After World. These people are beyond twisted. The atrocities that they are putting humans through for their own maniacal narcissistic reasons are pure craziness. The readers are given much more Dor in this book. He is a fascinating character. Just when you think that Dor does the things he does for his own advancement and purposes he shows a different side of himself. He is a very caring man and a loving father. I enjoyed getting to know his character better. I will continue reading this series. I\u2019m very eager to see where the author takes Cass and the other passengers she has in the van at the end of the book. My complaints for this book are weak and personal whiney complaints. Rebirth moved at a much slower pace than Aftertime. The action scenes are fast paced and intense, but some of the in between time dragged. There is a cliffhanger ending. I hate these. This is why I like to read series that have been out for some time and there are numerous books to answer all of my unanswered questions. My other complaint was the sex. I know this is Cass and her behavior towards men due to her past. It just felt like raw, dirty sex to me. The romance aspect was missing. I don\u2019t want to give away a spoiler, but considering the sex scenes of the book there should have been a lack of romance.

The follow up to 'Aftertime', Sophie Littlefield's post apocalyptic California-based zombie (Beaters as they're known here) survival horror is just as suspenseful and vivid as any of its kind. A morbid opening unleashes a torrent of dread and sets the tone for the rest of the novel as a Box inhabitant is put to rest in a shallow grave following yet another untimely death. Apt given the life expectancy is significantly lower in this new world with a dwindling human population and a thriving (if I can use that word) Beater meat economy. In 'Rebirth' we reintroduced to Cass, as more of her dark back story is revealed from her battle with alcohol to various misgivings in her youth/early adult life to her varied and lengthy interactions with members of the opposite sex. Cass is one hard woman, no more so than in this book as she uses her bodily currency to make men do her bidding in an effort to save those she holds dear. Vivacious and vicious, the Outlier fights like a caged demon to protect her faithful at all costs, providing some of the most entertaining scenes I've ever read. On a mission to bring back lover, Smoke, she is once again thrust into the hardships of a broken world - interestingly enough, its not the Beaters who pose the most significant threat, rather, the Rebuilders, a faction of society hell bent on developing immunity to the virus while raping and pillaging the world of its resources. Similar in many ways to Aftertime but with an added layer of human emotion and world building depth, Rebirth is an adventure doused in noir on a hotbed of horror.

Lots of stuff happening in this, yet the action doesn't really pick up until the second half of the book. In the first half, there's a lot of introspection and internal dialogue and just stuff that I didn't like about Cassie. I had to keep telling myself that she's a flawed character, recovering from child abuse and alcoholism and a host of other problems before the shit hit the fan with the rest of the world. Of course she's going to do things and say things and make choices that I disagree with.

Posso dire senza ombra di dubbio che, essendo amante anche della vecchia fantascienza, trovare un lavoro che si allontana dall\u2019urban fantasy e dove l\u2019amore per le cose e le persone \u00e8 presente senza esserne la parte principale della storia, \u00e8 bellissimo e non posso che consigliarlo caldamente, specialmente a tutti quelli che come me, in giovent\u00f9 hanno letto e amato Asimov, King, o Robin Cook .Baby Lady Kira - per RFS"}, {"userName": "HannahCassie (PSIloveThatBook)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431708-hannahcassie-psilovethatbook", "userReview": "MORE? MORE! @ P.S. I love that book!EXPECTATIONS: Okay so Rebirth is the second installment in Aftertime series by Sophie Littlefield. I have started this series pretty recently and felt all the way to the bottom in love with it so no surprise I ended up picking up the second book almost immediately.THE WORLD: As the blurb already indicated, the world has fallen. Once upon a time there was a virus releases which turned people in Beaters aka Zombies and now they are after the survivors. Pretty much 95 or even 98% of population have turned into Beaters by now and the rest aka survivors are living in clusters in supposedly protected places. Well protected really as much as they can protect it themselves. And not just from the Beaters. There is a group called Rebuilders who fancy themselves the savers of human kind but really it is either you are with them or you die. So when I said protected places as much as you can protect it yourself, you protect them from Beaters pretty much till Rebuilders come and burn you down. At least that's what happened with the shelter at school. Anyways, this whole burning down the school shelters is what sets this book into actions because Smoke goes onto suicide/revenge mission to Rebuilders and Cass with Dor follow him. And that is how we meet very very bad people and later even worse Rebuilders. Oh and a few Beaters, but not that many in this book frankly.CHARACTERS: So Cass....oh how much I loved her in the first book. I am not saying she gets worse in this book but there is just something about her that I don't like, something new and skinny and not Cass style at all. Basically she is pissed that Smoke leaves her and Ruthie behind and goes to revenge on Rebuilders. So she goes to Dor, the leader of the box where they live and because Rebuilders have Sammy, Dor's daughter Cass, Dor and Ruthie set out to follow Smoke and go to Rebuilders to get Sammy out. What happens during the time they travel was a bit well I don't know. I guess apocalypse brings out the worst of the people, especially where we had the part about barricade. But it was also realistic so all good in the end. And then we have Cass and Dor...hell I did not how to feel about whole situation at first but eventually Dor grew on me. I mean really Smoke just left and he supposedly has this big scary secret well you know what? In ya face Smoke, I am team Dor now. You don't deserve Cass.ROMANCE: So I kinda spilled the beans already, we get a triangle. But not the worst type of so it kinda does not get annoying much.GOOD: I liked that they went back on the road again. There is action. And I love the kind of action Sophie Littlefield writes. Plus she really can make you mad...some people are just evil but that is pretty much pink fields in comparison to Rebuilders. Let me just drop a few phrases here...like baby factory...or ash tray full of wedding rings...or I don't even know. Just horrible people.BAD: I am not sure if there really was a minus in this book besides that nagging feeling I started to get towards Cass. She has changed and I did not necessary liked where it was going.OVERALL: Jup still in love with the series. Sophie Littlefield managed to avoid a second book syndrome for sure! Of we go to the third and final book!MORE? MORE! @ P.S. I love that book!"}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081722-shelley", "userReview": "Rating: 4.0 Genre: Adult Dystopian-Zombies**Review**Rebirth, by Sophie Littlefield, is the second book in the Aftertime series. It has only been eight months since the air force rained Kaysev down from the sky during their last flights in hopes of saving the remaining survivors of a bio terrorism attack. The plant was meant to feed the population, but instead caused widespread panic because of what happened with the blueleaf fever that spawned the Beaters in the first place. Originally it was limited to California, but spread outward. Supposingly, the east is the only safe area remaining in the country. Kaysev is now used in every part of life including fuel. What lie behind the survivors is the Siege, Beaters, famine and the devastation and death that was left in its wake. What lies ahead is an uncertain future where it\u2019s anyone guesses whether or not the Beaters will win out in the end or if they will have enough supplies to last through the winter months.Rebirth reintroduces readers to Cass Dollar, Smoke, Dor, and Ruthie. Alot of this book is pro-Dor and that is fine with me. We don\u2019t really get to see much of Smoke after he leaves on his walkabout after the Rebuilders attacked the school in Silva where his former lover Nora lived. They burned it down and gave the women and children a choice to join them or die. All the men were killed. One of those taken was Dor's own daughter Sammi who lived there with her mother.Doran (Dor) is the founder and leader of the box. He is a trader and enforcer of the peace. The residents of the Box live in a former football stadium where they trade for goods and services. He believes things are going to get a whole lot worse and soon. Rations and raiding parties aren\u2019t as abundant as they were before, and winter is just around the corner. Dor realizes that his position at the Box is not as important as saving his daughter.After Smoke takes his walk for revenge, Cass and Dor leave together from the Box. Cass wants to find Smoke who went for a walk for justice for the members of the school where he and Cass first met. Cass believes that Smoke betrayed her in leaving her behind without even asking if she wanted to go with him or saying goodbye. Cass believed that she was slowly building a new life with Smoke and Ruthie, and that things were actually getting better. Dor also knows a secret about Smoke that Cass doesn\u2019t. This secret, if told, would shock her to the core.Cass Dollar hasn\u2019t taken a drink of alcohol in nearly 10 months. She used to be a fall down drunk and drug addict before everything fell apart. Cass is also an outlier; a person who survived being infected by zombies and came back to life. It happened almost 4 months ago and it appears she is fully healed now with minor scars. Cass and Ruthie have been living at the Box with Smoke for nearly three months. Cass, since her infection, has changed. Her hair grows faster, as does her nails. Cass\u2019s past is riddled with things that she can\u2019t do anything to change. Not her stepfather molesting her. Not the fact that she slept with 200 or more men of all ages. Not even the fact that she lost Ruthie because of an alcoholic relapse. Cass uses the only weapon she has in retaliation for Smoke\u2019s betrayal; her own body. She also believes she is protecting her daughter, but in reality she is doing what thousands of women before her did before her; using her body to get what she wants from others. Ruthie, who hasn\u2019t spoken in forever, has what appears to be premonition into what is going to happen. She seems to know when things are going to happen before hand including carrion birds arriving to an ambush that neither Cass or Dor see's coming. Ruthie also seems to be coming out of her cocoon of silence after what she experienced at the hands of the covenant that refused to allow children to speak. Ruthie is also an outlier like her mother.Rebirth, in my humble opinion, moves really slowly until you get halfway into the story. I would definitely rate the last part of this book when Cass, Dor and Ruthie arrive at the Rebuilder camp, the best action and story of the entire book. The ending leaves a lot of different feelings that I'm forced to wait till next year when the next installment comes out to find answers to my questions.I am a believer that Aftertime was the better story of the two books released so far. I appreciate the fact that we get to see more of the Rebuilders who are plain and simple evil, especially Rebuilder scientist Mary Vane who is as creepy as anyone you will meet. If you aren\u2019t with them, then they eliminate you. If you are an outlier, and a female, you are prized possessions for the Rebuilder leadership who claims they are looking for a cure but have other plans instead.I really had a hard time grasping Cass's character this time around. She was rather lethargic and boring most of the first half. She pretty much jumps Dor's bones, and then later is shocked when he turns around and wants it again. In the end after they escape from the Rebuilders, she\u2019s an entirely different character altogether which will definitely make me look forward to the next installment.It was recently announced by the author that Horizon will be released February 2012.

Cass has Ruthie back, and the two of them, plus Smoke, are now a seemingly perfect little family - but this semblance of a fairytale life (as much as one can have in a post-apocalyptic, zombie-ridden world) in the Box is about to change.Smoke receives word that the Rebuilders, who give people two choices: JOIN or DIE, have executed a group of people in the school he used to take refuge in. Not only that, but Dor's (the man who founded and runs the Box) daughter, Sammi, was one of the few that were taken into their custody. And now? Smoke is out for vengeance. He leaves the Box without even a word to Cass - leaving her to feel abandoned, heartbroken, and positively infuriated.Cass quickly finds out from Dor that he also plans to leave the Box the next day. With resources beginning to diminish and her lover gone, Cass decides it's time for her to move on as well. So, she convinces Dor to let her and Ruthie go with him on his mission to save Sammi from the Rebuilders.Things only become more complicated from here. Dor and Cass develop and odd love/hate relationship. Dor is hiding something about Smoke. Ruthie, who is usually a mute child, is beginning to blurt out seemingly prophetic words in her sleep. Blue-leaf kaysev, dwindling resources, desperate/violent squatters, and Rebuilders aren't the only dangers out there; The threat of the Beaters is ever present.- - -Gosh, what to say about this book? It was fantastic! I don't have any complaints about it whatsoever. I knew Sophie Littlefield would not disappoint.The characters are as multi-dimensional and intense as ever. Cass is passionate and damaged, but puts the people she cares about front and center. She sacrifices again, and again, and again. Smoke is becoming quite the enigma. What the heck is going on with him? I have no idea. It wasn't revealed to us in Rebirth, but the prospect of this secret's big reveal is almost too much for me to handle. And DOR, oh... Dor. He is my new favorite character. I love his broody outer-shell, and his big heart. Talk about paradox! One minute he's talking about how selfish he is, how much he could never care for anyone but himself - but the next he's throwing himself in the line of fire to protect people he doesn't even know, carrying precious Ruthie on his shoulders, and treating Cass with tender care. While I am on that subject: I love Cass and Dor together. Their relationship has this amazing passion that teeters on the tightrope of love and hate. You can just TELL something amazing is there. I hope with all my might that they are going explore this further in Horizon. The intimate scenes between these two were downright steamy. I needed to fan myself afterward. Phew!The pace of the book was pure perfection. The continuation of the story was as epically amazing as the beginning. I could not get enough! I read it in about 6 hours. Every single paragraph left me in need of more more more! The author threw in all sorts of bombshells, too. The Rebuilders are up to some hardcore, terrible things. Smoke and Dor are both riddled with secrets. We learn more about Cass' past and the hardships she had to endure. Something completely strange is going on with Ruthie. The Beaters are getting desperate and smarter. The story also comes complete with a total cliffhanger of an ending.Final words: Rebirth is the best sophomore novel I had the pleasure of reading in all of 2011 (It's December 3rd, but I am completely confident I can say this and not have to take it back later). It's raw. It's brutally honest. It's mesmerizing. It's intense. It's emotional. It's chilling, haunting. It's a roller-coaster of genius. In a world replete with dangers, in a setting as bleak as they come - Sophie Littlefield has created a passionate web of human emotion that you really just can't, no... shouldn't miss.If you want a post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested, powerful, and moving novel - this book is for you. :) *Contains adult content - definitely not suitable for minors*"}, {"userName": "usagi \u2606\u30df", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1101220-usagi", "userReview": "Okay, I\u2019ll admit it \u2013 I was more than a little disappointed in how this sequel was executed. There was a great deal of omitted information in terms of what happened between the end of the first book and the start of the second, which is going to be released in novella format in July, right before the release of this book. Hopefully reading that will fill in the blanks, but until then, I\u2019ll review based on what I know.I knew that Cass had some serious issues with sexual abuse and hypersexuality as a result of that abuse, as well as being an alcoholic, but I felt that Littlefield made her go a little too far off the deep end with Smoke\u2019s departure for revenge over staying with her. Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m not in a desperate post-apocalyptic situation with zombies wanting to nom my face off, but I felt like she really overreacted to the entire thing. She knew that Smoke\u2019s hunger for revenge might overwhelm his love for her, and yet she took the chance to be with him anyway. I\u2019m not blaming the victim, but had she wanted to hold onto Smoke, they really should have been more explicit with each other when talking about future goals and if staying together was just a temporary thing.If anything, I found myself getting extremely pissed off with Cass, especially toward the end of the book with how she blatantly used Dor, and he had the right of it when he spoke of her hiding behind other people (more specifically men, himself and Smoke) to solve all of her problems for her. And yes, while she had that really awful Beater attack that turned her into an outlier, and she had to fend for herself with both finding and keeping her daughter, she kind of ruined my trust in her as a sympathetic reader by giving into her demons when she could have found some other way not to.The entire book she speaks of how important her daughter is to her, but with her behavior, it kind of spoke otherwise. It seemed like she was willing to release her demons in order to get revenge, her daughter all but forgotten in the process. I lost respect for her as a heroine, even while taking all of her horrible experiences into consideration. The saddest of all, I think, is that Littlefield could have crafted her differently. I know that there are heroines that turn into anti-heroines and vice-versa, but this was just kind of depressing to read. I\u2019m all for reality and realism in my books, but this was just a little too much to absorb and a little too over the top in such a setting of despair for me to really enjoy Littlefield\u2019s prose. It\u2019s only when Ruthie is really threatened (or perceived to be threatened) by someone else does Cass really go back to being the heroine I enjoyed in the first book. And it shouldn\u2019t have to be that way.The only redeeming factor that overwhelmed Cass\u2019 self-loathing and bad behavior was her desire to preserve her daughter (and save Dor\u2019s daughter) in the face of the big bad, Mary Vane, and her machinations for using as many people as possible to develop a vaccine. Littlefield really hit home the fact that everyone is out for themselves regardless of what they say in this sad future with the character of Mary Vane, more than any other big bad that had come before. This ruthlessness to restore humanity at all costs was almost overwhelming, and with Littlefield\u2019s prose, made me feel as if I really were in this bleak future. The horror of the Big Reveal of what these plans entailed really made things finally get interesting instead of just giving into one\u2019s demons, and sadly, this was only within the last 80 pages of the book.I guess you could say I\u2019m feeling more than mixed about this series at this point in time \u2014 Cass seems to flip-flop on almost anything except for when it comes to her daughter. I don\u2019t quite know what to feel about such a heroine. I\u2019m glad that Littlefield writes a future that may not having a happy ending, but at the same time, I\u2019m not sure it had to be so heavy-handed.At this point, I\u2019m not sure whether or not I\u2019ll be reading the novella or any future books. But this book does deserve a read if you\u2019ve read the first book, if only to get closure. It must be said that one thing I do love about Littlefield is that she\u2019s not afraid to test the boundaries of pretty much everything in literature, even if the results aren\u2019t always the greatest. It took balls to write this sequel, even if it was sad, but it was solid in the end.So, I guess, give it a try, and see for yourself how you feel about Cass Dollar by the end of the book.(crossposted to librarything, shelfari, and witchoftheatregoing.wordpress.com)"}, {"userName": "Anissa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7538688-anissa", "userReview": "[Cass seeking to hookup with Dor, not 48 hours after Smoke left the Box.

Littlefield has not created a series that could be read out of order or stand alone novel, you need to read the first book Aftertime. There are spoilers from the first book in the review below, so if you are interested in reading this series I suggest you read my review of Aftertime first. Now that you have been warned.....Civilization as we've known it has fallen, especially in the state of California. Cassandra Dollar had thought that she had found the last piece of suto civilization within the box. Her, Ruthie and Smoke could try to live as a family, and help Ruthie recover from her time in the convent. But Cass can feel Smoke slipping away and the more time he is spending with Dor, the less he seems to be with Cass. Then news reaches the Box that the library where Smoke used to live has been burned by the Rebuilders and Nora (Smoke's former lover) was killed and Sammi (Dor's daughter) was taken by the Rebuilders to their headquarters. Smoke decides to leave Cass, Ruthie and the box behind, without telling Cass in order to get revenge on those who had harm the library. Cass is now alone in the Box and she can see that it is slowly deteriorating especially when she finds out that Dor is leaving to get Sammi back. Cass enters into another journey out in the world with the Beaters and Rebuilder this time she does not know if her heart and mind will be survive.After reading the first book, Aftertime, I could not wait for the second. As soon as I received a copy of Rebirth I put down every other book I was reading in order to read this right away. There are very few series that I will do this for, and Littlefield has joined those ranks. I cannot say enough about this Littlefield's Series. This series makes me crawl right inside the world that she has creating wanting more and waiting for Littlefield to go deeper in the the psychology of how people and the world have changed.Littlefield has created some the best zombies (Beaters) out there. The primitive intelligence that they hold but slowly developing into a more intelligent creature. It is almost like the Beaters are humans that have been reset to primitive times. Although you do not get to read too much of the Beaters in this book you know that they are always watching and waiting for a human to make a mistake. Littlefield focuses on a more scary aspect, what Humans will do to each other a post apocalyptic time. Cass is as tough and vulnerable as ever, and with Smoke leaving her to fend for herself and Ruthie, she knows that it is time to leave the Box. She can tell that the Box will soon become the place of chaos especially when Dor decided to leave in order to try to find Sammi. Even though Cass is trying to escape her life before Aftertime, she know that the main things that she is able to trade in this world are her body and her blood (as she is an outlier). Yes this does mean that there is sex in the book, but the sex scenes does not take away from the storyline (Note: there are more sex scenes in this book than the first one). I also like the introduction of Cass's coping mechanism when awful things are happening, as this is a very real psychological aspect that many people use in order to survive tough situations.Dor becomes a major character within this book, and i think that story benifited with the introduction of another strong male lead, and I enjoyed getting to know Dor better, as he is such a mysterious character in the first. Not that you get to know everything about Dor, he still keeps his mystery about him, but you can tell that he is a man with many layers and i look forward to see where Littlefield is going to take his character and his relationship with Smoke and Cass.I really enjoyed this book and I am loving this series. Rebirth is a great addition and I think it is a good as a first. Some people may be disappointed as there is less Beater interaction within this book, but I think the apocalyptic dystopain nature of the book stays true. I cannot wait for the next book in this series. Rebirth comes out July 19, 2011 so you still have time to read the first book before the second one comes out if you have not picked it up yet.Enjoy!!!!"}, {"userName": "Lisarenee", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2038272-lisarenee", "userReview": "Notes: I read the ARC (Advanced Reader Copy) of Rebirth. The book has sex and violence (rape). We've all heard of incidents where violence runs amuck. Where chaos reigns and law and order seems nonexistent. Usually such scenes can be found after a disaster of a large magnitude. This is what has happened in Aftertime (the name of the first book in the series). A bio terrorist attack on the US left many dead and others fighting to survive. Next, a bioengineering experiment gone wrong left a portion of the survivors seemingly inhuman. They're called beaters. Once human, they now survive on human flesh, and are, in essence, zombies. They pose a threat to those survivors who are still human. While pockets of order still remain, one group, known as the Rebuilders, is attempting to takeover. Promising shelter and safety from Beaters, the group sounds ideal, however, it has a hidden agenda. In Rebirth, we get to find out what that agenda entails. In Aftertime, we followed the story of Cass. She found her daughter, and she, Smoke, and Ruthie became a makeshift family living in the Box. The Box is a community that while not perfect, offers security. In Rebirth, the school where Smoke and Cass met has been attacked by Rebuilders on a recruiting mission. You are either with the Rebuilders or you're against them which makes you their enemy. You have two choices when they find you, join or die. Many in the small group that lived at the school died resisting. The others were taken as prisoners. When Smoke hears what happened, he is profoundly affected. He takes off on what Cass believes is suicide mission. She does not expect him to survive. He doesn't even say goodbye.With Smoke gone, Cass determines it's time to leave the security of the Box. She believes, in time, the small community will not be able to survive. She decides to help Dor with his mission to find and rescue his daughter, Sammi. Dor was informed that Sammi was among the survivors of the school massacre. Cass convinces Dor that since she and Ruthie are Outliers, the Rebuilders will be interested in them, and that will give him a better chance at getting access to their society. Outliers are resistant to the bioengineered component that transforms a person into a Beater. They may be key to the world's survival.In this book we get to know more about Dor and his life. He is the leader of the Box and was a bit elusive in Aftertime. We also see more of the flaws in Cass' character. She will do things in Rebirth that Smoke, if he survives, may never be able to forgive her for doing. Then again, she may not be able to forgive him for abandoning her and Ruthie.I didn't like what I saw in Cass this time around. She did a couple of things that did not sit well with me. It's obvious she still has issues from the abuse she suffered as a child. While I may have had issues with what Cass did, I feel Littlefield stayed true to the characteristics she developed for Cass in Aftertime, so I give her kudos for that. I look forward to seeing what the next book in the series will bring. The book leaves off on a cliffhanger, as a confrontation is about to take place. I can't wait to see what happens. Also, Dor wanted to tell Cass something about Smoke that would have made her understand why Smoke left her. Unfortunately, he never did tell her, and I sooooo want to know what that was. I'm also starting to wonder if maybe Dor is the right man for Cass? I look forward to finding out if that relationship will deepen or cause problems in the next book. Additionally, there's still a question as to who will survive--at least one character was teetering on the brink of death. Wondering why the book is called Rebirth? I believe it's because part of the plan of the Rebuilders is to \"Rebirth\" the nation, or at least their portion of it. My overall rating for this one is 4 out of 5 roses.Order Series should be read:\n\n1. Aftertime2.

Well Sophie Littlefield has done it again with Rebirth. The sequel coming out quickly after its debut packs as big of an emotional punch as the first book. Littlefield has once again given us a book that beautifully written and heartwrenching. Rebirth starts a little bit after Aftertime has left off. Cass is living in the Box with Smoke and Ruthie. They are alive and as well as they can be. Beaters (zombies) are still roaming around, but Dor has the Box well secured. Everyone is content until the Box receives news about the Rebuilders. The Rebuilders are a group of people who are using people\u2019s desperation to create their own world. They give everyone two choices; join or die. When Cass and the others find out what they have done to their friends at the library, Smoke takes it upon himself to avenge them including the woman he was with before he met Cass. This starts a domino effect for Cass. While she is battling with trying to keep her and Ruthie above water, Cass is also battling with herself and her past demons.  What surprised me most about this is that we start to see things from Dor\u2019s point of view. He comes off as nothing but a greedy, selfish, take-no-bullshit type of man. But we discover that finding out that his daughter has been taken, Dor tries to go on a one man killing spree. Unfortunately, Cass is tired of the Box and hurt by what Smoke has done. While working on their plan to get into the Rebuilder\u2019s colony, Cass takes her pain out on Dor. This was something I didn\u2019t expect, but was realistic. I understood why things went the way they did, but some might not like it. Aftertime is already on my Best Book of 2011 list. I will put Rebirth on my Best Sequel of 2011 list. Honestly this is one of the greatest series I have read. The characters are believable. They are trying to stay alive, but they are still human and are battling with things that just don\u2019t go away because the world has changed. It has been said plenty of times, but I will say it again. The book is quite reminiscent to The Walking Dead in that aspect. Zombies are a part of the equation, but they are not the only factor. We see that even though the world isn\u2019t the same anymore and everyone wants to survive, there are more threats than just the zombies. And sometimes it is you that you are up against. The plot is rich, well-paced and insane. With every chapter, we get another bombshell. When things fall into place and we find out exactly what the Rebuilders are up to, it added just another layer of horror to the story. I didn\u2019t think it was possible considering all that they are enduring, but trust me, it gets far worse. I won\u2019t go so much into this because I am afraid to reveal secrets. I don\u2019t know what else I can say for you to read this series. It is truly extraordinary. Littlefield really didn\u2019t hold much back in this sequel, so please be prepared for some uncomfortable scenes. This book was raw and emotional. Rebirth is a powerful book that will once again put you on an emotional rollercoaster. Being placed in a world that is lost and full of desperation and anguish, Littlefield has once again given us a beautiful piece of work. I heard this is going to be a trilogy so the next book is it, but honestly, I wish it didn\u2019t have to end. Make sure to buy this July 19. Read it and then read it again."}, {"userName": "Jenny Q", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2661064-jenny-q", "userReview": "I was so impressed with Sophie Littlefield's Aftertime, that I had to read Rebirth right away. It's very hard to review this series without letting spoilers slip, so mostly I'm just going to tell you a bit about why I like these books so much. Aftertime was my first zombie novel and I thought Littlefield did a fantastic job of immersing the reader in her post-apocalytpic world without bogging the story down in details and backstory. Biological warfare destroyed the world's food supply and poisoned the majority of its population. Those that are left struggle to subsist in isolated pockets of civilization where there is safety in numbers; barricaded against Beaters (former humans who are now super-strong flesh-eating zombies thanks to eating contaminated genetically-engineered crops), and distrustful of the Rebuilders, a neo-military organization trying to re-establish control. It's downright scary and intense. But for me the best thing about this series is Cass Dollar.Talk about someone who has been put through the ringer and never gives up. She's no wonder woman, no ass-kicking heroine--she just has this deep-seated primal urge to survive and to keep going no matter what. In Aftertime Cass was miraculously recovering from an attack by the Beaters--miraculous because those victims who aren't fortunate enough to be killed outright by them turn into Beaters. But not Cass. Her sheer grit and determination propelled her across dangerous country in search of her young daughter Ruthie, and along the way she reluctantly accepted the help of strong and silent hottie Smoke. Cass had learned the hard way never to trust a man and had vowed never to give herself to one again. But of course, she did. And she slowly came to rely on Smoke, to allow herself the luxury of feeling safer, of daring to hope they could have a future and a family in a world where futures and families don't exist. In the Aftertime.And then in the beginning of Rebirth, Smoke leaves. Now don't judge--you don't know the whole story. But Cass takes it pretty hard. And ends up making some rash decisions and doing some stupid things and really messing with another man's head in the process. And Dor is such a hard character to read, but I like him. Leader of the safe camp where Cass and Smoke found refuge, he's leaving that safety behind to rescue his teenage daughter from the fanatical Rebuilders, and Cass and Ruthie are going with him, hoping to find a better life on the other side. And that's where I'll leave off with the plot because it is just non-stop action and tension from here on out. Whether it's an edge-of-your-seat life and death struggle or an emotional knock-out, it's all intense. And it's all good. My only real complaint is that I feel like Cass's introspection drags on a bit and gets repetitive. But this leaves off with a cliffhanger and one hardcore, gritty love triangle in place. I only wish I didn't have to wait so long to see what happens next. This series won't be for everybody; it's post-apocalyptic and it's got zombies, and some shock and horror, but at its heart it's really emotional, character-driven fiction, and the kind that makes an impression on you and stays with you long after you've read it."}], "description": "The end of the world was just the beginningCivilization has fallen, leaving California an unforgiving, decimated place.
