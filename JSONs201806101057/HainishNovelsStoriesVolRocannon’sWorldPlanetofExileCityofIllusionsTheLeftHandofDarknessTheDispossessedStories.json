The whole is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. It's an amazing achievement, definitely worth reading for any fan of science fiction, or even of political philosophies, or of feminism. The novels and stories definitely gained in meaning and resonance from being read close together. (It took me about 6 weeks to get through all 1000+ pages.)This volume contains five novels:Rocannon's WorldPlanet of ExileCity of IllusionsThe Left Hand of DarknessThe DispossessedAlso four short stories and several essays and commentaries. Full review to come.I received a free copy of this book (and Volume 2 as well) from the publisher for review."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1433865-robert", "userReview": "Rocannon's WorldLe Guin's first Hainish novel is as much fantasy as science fiction and as much derived from Norse myth as anything contemporary. It's slight but distinctive, more fun than profound. It saved my interest in Le Guin's SF, though, after I was heavily put off by The Dispossessed, which I found slow, dull and obvious - in sharp contrast to seemingly everybody else who's read it.Planet of ExileProbably the most conventional SF adventure tale Le Guin ever wrote and yet it shows glimmers of the concerns that would become trade-mark Le Guin themes; clash of cultures, reconciliation of differences, anthropology. Surprisingly violent.City of IllusionsI liked this much more first time round, I think because it was the best Le Guin SF novel I had read at the time. Since then, Left Hand of Darkness and The Lathe of Heaven have completely overshadowed all these early works about the League of All Worlds. I'm not sure Le Guin has ever been all that comfortable with the technological trappings of SF or the pew! pew! of simplistic adventure/space opera stories. Her strengths lie in character and culture. The opportunity to imagine completely different societies is what SF&F gave her and when she shifted to play to her strengths her great works began to flow. Nevertheless, our protagonist's struggles when he arrives in the City of Illusions are still psychologically compelling to me and the description of a heavily depopulated North America are fun.The Left Hand of DarknessMy re-reading of this was heavily disrupted by having to focus on other books as a matter of urgency. Nevertheless I enjoyed it greatly, as previously. This time I was struck by how everything goes wrong through mis-communication. Genli Ai can't understand the rules of the alien culture he's been dropped in, alone and with no immediate help to hand. On Gethen people can only communicate obliquely and this compounds the political shenanigans surrounding Genli's arrival. The confusion ultimately causes death. Nothing goes right until people start talking to each other openly and honestly.It's nothing to do with gender, but it's what I took from this reading.Winter's KingOK, now I want to talk about gender. The original version of this story was written prior to Left Hand of Darkness and is re-printed in the appendix of this volume. This version was re-written after Left Hand was published and it switches from referring to everybody on Gethen as \"he\" to referring to everybody as \"she.\" Immediately I switched from thinking of the characters as male to thinking of them as female. But they are both and neither.I've never come across a better illustration of why we need gender-neutral pronouns in English. It's looking like \"they\" is going to win out despite the consequent singular-plural ambiguity.Also, good story about the effects of special relativity!Winter's King1969 (original) version. Not as good as the later revision."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\"...all are the stars, and the darkness between the stars: and all are bright.\"- Ursula K.

And, something even more so when it contains the works of a master story teller. Le Guin's Hainish novels and stories are a wonderful treasure trove of ideas and language and philosophy. She loves to talk about journeys, but physical and internal, and I love to take the journeys with her and her characters."}, {"userName": "Jason Bergman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4708605-jason-bergman", "userReview": "I've already logged/reviewed most of the contents of this book individually, but this is specifically to count all the other stuff that's in here.

Le Guin redrew the map of modern science fiction. In such visionary masterworks as the Nebula and Hugo Award winners The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed, she imagined a galactic confederation of human colonies founded by the planet Hain\u2014an array of worlds whose divergent societies, the result of both evolution and genetic engineering, afford a rich field for literary explorations of \u201cthe nature of human nature,\u201d as Margaret Atwood has described Le Guin\u2019s subject. Now, for the first time, the complete Hainish novels and stories are collected in a definitive two-volume Library of America edition, with new introductions by the author.Le Guin first conceived her League of All Worlds in three early novels of daring inventiveness. In Rocannon\u2019s World (1966), Hainish scientist Gaverel Rocannon ventures to an unnamed planet to conduct a peaceful ethnological survey only to discover a secret outpost of the League\u2019s deadly enemy. In Planet of Exile (1966), the fate of colonists from Earth stranded on distant Werel depends on working together with the planet\u2019s indigenous peoples if they are to survive the oncoming fifteen-year winter. City of Illusions (1967), set far in the future on a sparsely populated Earth that has lost contact with all other planets and is ruled by the mysterious, mind-lying Shing, turns on the appearance of an amnesiac with yellow eyes who may hold the key to humanity\u2019s freedom.In The Left Hand of Darkness (1969) Earth-born Genly Ai travels to wintery Gethen to convince its nations to join the Ekumen, the confederation of known worlds. To do so he must navigate the subtleties of politics and culture on a planet populated by an ambisexual people who have never known war. This is the novel that inspired Harold Bloom to observe that \u201cLe Guin, more than Tolkien, has raised fantasy into high literature.\u201dThe Dispossessed (1974), a philosophical adventure story in which a physicist strives to complete a theory of simultaneity that will for the first time allow instantaneous communication between all the planets of humanity, is set against the backdrop of Le Guin\u2019s richly textured vision of what an anarchist society might look like in practice.Also included are four short stories and six essays about the novels, plus the surprising original 1969 version of the story \u201cWinter\u2019s King.\u201d The endpaper map of Gethen has been colorized from a drawing by Le Guin herself.", "title": "Hainish Novels & Stories, Vol. 1: Rocannon\u2019s World / Planet of Exile / City of Illusions / The Left Hand of Darkness / The Dispossessed / Stories", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33533490.Ursula_K__Le_Guin_Hainish_Novels_and_Stories__Vol__1", "average": 4.62, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498885691l/33533490.jpg", "reviews": 8, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/874602.Ursula_K_Le_Guin", "name": "Ursula K.
