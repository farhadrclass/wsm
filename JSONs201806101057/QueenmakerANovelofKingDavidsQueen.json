No one could be that powerful and \"heroic\" without also being ruthless and self-centered! Not only are is the era (ca. 1000BCE) drawn in a palpable, realistic, sensual way, but also the behind-the-scenes motives and machinations which help explore and fill in the gaps between David the King and David the man - and everyone he affected, especially Michal and his other wives. From David\u2019s first audacious victory over Goliath and the Philistines through war, intrigue, love, lust, betrayal, compromise and treachery, Michal is thrust into often untenable positions which test her character, her ingenuity, her faith and her loyalty. I really empathized and often identified with her difficulties, so found her very believable. Edghill writes with true sensibility for the biblical era (no jarring anachronisms of thought or description at all) and with a deep insight into the characters of men and women confronted with choices between love and revenge, power and influence, and even life and death. Queenmaker is an absorbing, thoughtful book, and I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Cassandra", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2611188-cassandra", "userReview": "My husband spotted this book on the library shelf and handed it to me. When I read the inside cover, I was really intrigued - a novel that shows King David's life from the perspective of Michal, his first wife. That should be interesting!Well... I didn't like the narrating style. This tells the story of Michal and also of David's rise to power but it was narrated from the perspective of Michal's final days of life, as if she was looking back on her life. Therefore, there was a lot of \"I thought I was being wise but I would come to find out later that I was still very naive.\" That really annoyed me.There was very little outside of the Bible story. I was surprised that a 350 page novel didn't really make me feel as if I had learned anything new. I also didn't really feel like I was made aware of the setting of the story. Sure, most of it took place in a palace, but there was very little description that placed the story in a specific time period. It could have happened anywhere in the world at any point in time prior to 1900.The worst part of the novel is it's Biblical inaccuracy. David is made out to be a conniving, manipulative, selfish, and cold hearted man who only wants to be approved of by man. There was no sense that David was ever listening to God or even considered where God was leading. This is odd, considering the Bible calls David \"a man after God's own heart.\" Nathan (God's prophet after Samuel) was portrayed as weak, giving unfulfilled prophecy, and blind to what David was really like. Seriously? I know my review is harsh, but the only thing that kept me from giving it a 1 star is that I wanted to see how it ended. I was hoping that Michal would learn that David was unselfish, listening to God, and that she had misunderstood him. Nope! In this story, David died a selfish cold man who didn't care about God. If you care about novels portraying Biblical figures correctly, don't bother with this novel."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17792052-amy", "userReview": "Queenmaker, by India Edghill, was fabulous! I loved it. Every bit as good as its sequel I read a few years ago, Wisdom's Daughter, by the same author. I happen to love historical fiction, also the misrash-y type books that fill in the spaces of the women and stories of our biblical times. I had never heard of, or knew much about Queen Michal, but I loved her character and the twists and turns of the story. It was a delight, and the writing was terrific. I'll spoil the writing at the end, but not the outcome. (History has done that for us.) At the end, India Eghill and Queen Michal remind us, that in the constant contest between love and wisdom, love wins, but they both win, because to love is to be wise. Don't you love that? And its so true. Love is wisdom, directly from the heart. How's your heart these days? Helping you make wise choices, I hope, that feel true and authentic, and aligned with self-purpose.Now starting \"Away\" by Amy Bloom.

Basing her interpretation on a few Biblical references, Edghill fleshes out the character of Michal (and the other women in David's life, including Bathsheba and Abishag) in a highly believable fashion. Equally interesting is her portrayal of David, from the young shepherd, harper and hero beloved - and feared - by Saul, to the ruthless warrior who united Israel, defeated its enemies and secured the fortress city of Jerusalem as its capitol, to the corrupt leader who killed both allies and rivals to get what he wanted, to the grief-stricken father who saw his sons conspire against him and each other for his power and his crown. Edghill has written several other historical novels featuring women mentioned in the Bible, and though normally this is not one of my favourite historical periods to read about, I'll be looking forward to reading them."}, {"userName": "Vlatko Kraljevski", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21390744-vlatko-kraljevski", "userReview": "Excellent bible story"}, {"userName": "Heather Zuber-Harshman", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6809511-heather-zuber-harshman", "userReview": "India Edghill paints a vivid picture of life and love during the reign of the Biblical King David. She draws the reader along on every step she takes, generally giving only enough description for you to \"see\" what is occurring. She creates true characters that have flaws, admirable qualities, fears, frustrations, and desires. Ms. Edghill also artfully entices you from one chapter or section to another. She frequently ends with a sense of foreboding, keeping you wondering what will happen. The three star rating was given because, although I don't believe the book was primarily intended for Christians based on the discussion questions in the back, there were many Biblical inaccuracies. Some of them included the following: having David not repent of his sin with Bathsheba when confronted by Nathan; having the \"sin\" child of David and Bathsheba live; having Amnon make love to Tamar rather than raping her; and having Absalom speak with David in court about killing Amnon rather than fleeing to his grandfather.

Somehow she managed to portray David as a vengeful jerk, and Absalom as a villian. Ammnon, who is clearly portrayed in the Bible as a villian, was given the role of a innocent, love sick boy. Michal herself took much credit for many things that David actually did. The biggest freedom Mrs. Edghill took was in the saving of Bathsheba's son. In her book she said that the son that God had said would die actually lived, and was Solomon. That is absolutely wrong. The Bible clearly states that that son DIED, it even goes into detail about how David reacted. I would recommend this book only because it is VERY well written and for the information that she provides (granted it is probably not true, but helps you understand Michal a little better) about Michal's second marriage to Paltiel.

I floated straight into \"Queenmaker\" and didn't come up for air until I was finished.I grabbed this book initially to read because I had always felt a bit sorry for David's queen, Michal. I thought a book written from her POV would be intriguing. I was not disappointed. I cannot vouch for the book's absolute Biblical accuracy, but with any work of fiction, liberties on the facts must be taken, and Edghill has envisioned her character's situation, troubles, actions and emotions with both acute sensitivity and a natural flow.It was the combination of her mesmerizing \"voice\" and style, and the fascinating story itself, that made this book go straight to my list of all-time favorites.I don't think you'll regret reading it!"}, {"userName": "Brie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/330628-brie", "userReview": "In the spirit of The Red Tent, this novel tells the story of of a Biblical woman, Michal, the daughter of King Saul and the wife of King David. As women's roles in the Bible are often vague and overshadowed by men's, this attempts to tell some of the stories from the Old Testament how Michal must have experienced them. The author has some great historical research tied in and the story is engrossing. It is also a very harsh criticism of David, the man, and brings his legend under the shadow of humanity. This book humanizes Biblical characters, making it easier to relate with historical characters and, if you so wish, religious figures."}, {"userName": "Joyce", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9818893-joyce", "userReview": "This is an imaginative (and dare I say it?) realistic take on King David; quite honestly, I've never been able to read the Psalms or the portions relating to David the way I used to before reading this novel.

Sooo close!"}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4681329-katie", "userReview": "Perhaps I should have seen the blurb on the front cover from People magazine, lauding the \"vivid attention to historical detail\" as a warning. At any rate, I was intrigued to read the story of King David from the perspective of his first wife. But this was a travesty in many ways. While there were places where I found the character of Michal to be sympathetic, she was largely annoying. And aside from the short segment (never even a full verse) of a verse from II Samuel that preceded each chapter (and was not always even used in context), there was no shred of Biblical accuracy. David is written as a blasphemous, lying, manipulative, vain, childish, thoroughly despicable person. Timelines are changed, a fictional writing tool I could accept. I can even deal with the fact that several names are changed (though some inexplicably). But aside from the absolute slander heaped on David, numerous facts are not only changed, but twisted in a mocking manner. Instead of David bringing Saul the foreskins of 100 Philistines as the bride-price for Michal, David returns with twice that many Philistine soldiers (who agree to be circumcised) to serve Saul. (These same soldiers are later used to David's advantage in \"taking\" his kingdom and building his palace.) Solomon is made to be the first -- and only -- child of David & Bathsheba, so instead of an infant who dies, Michal herself saves Solomon when he appears to be stillborn, thereby making the prophet Nathan look foolish when the judgment he pronounced fails to come true). The rape of Tamar by her half-brother Amnon is *completely* altered: Amnon is virtually a saint, he and Tamar are deeply in love and wish to marry, and Absalom murders Amnon out of jealousy and then kills Tamar, his full sister, to silence her. To further blacken David's name, the author makes David the crippler of his own nephew (son of his beloved late friend Jonathan). Instead of being crippled when he is dropped as a small child by his nurse, in this story he is being brought to live in David's palace as a much older child....only he arrives, not the healthy boy Michal has heard of, but no more than a crippled vegetable, broken and bruised beyond healing,and it is made clear that Michal *knows* this was done under David's orders -- presumably to prevent any threat to his throne. The author twists the verse where Michal sarcastically accuses David of \"uncovering\" himself before the people and turns it into David being completely naked, his skin slick and shiny with oil (or like oil?), a scene recalled again in the book, as if once weren't enough. (David wore a simple linen robe, like that of the priests, instead of his royal robes, when he danced before the Lord as the Ark of the Covenant was brought into the city.) David's desire to build a temple to glorify the Lord is morphed into Michael's conniving way of getting what she wants from David in the moment by convincing him that he will look good to the people and win gratitude from the priests for such a grand gesture. And even at the end of his life, the author makes a mockery of his final words. Apparently nothing about the historical figure of David, about whom much is written in the Bible, is sacred, so long as tarnishing it makes fodder to create a story for another character -- a character, while admittedly historical herself, about whom we have little knowledge and less documentation. (Speaking of documentation, there is no bibliography for this book....meaning no sources for the fantastical mess that has been spun.)Not only is David a thoroughly unpleasant and unlikable person, but Michal comes off that way, too, much of the time. She is bitter, hateful, vengeful, deceptive...and while the manner is which David has been redesigned gives merit to much of her feeling, it still leaves a person I do not believe I would care to have known.In the author's acknowledgments at the beginning, she states that part of the purpose of this book was \"to give a voice to a biblical woman long condemned to silence.\" If this is the voice she imagines, she would have been better to leave us with the silence."}, {"userName": "Christie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3386809-christie", "userReview": "Great look at the dark sides of biblical heroes, and it stays true to the source material.

The book is a first person narrative of Michal, King David's first wife (out of several) and the one to hold the title of Queen. The book follows the biblical books of Samuel and II Samuel from Michal's perspective; from her humble beginning as a daughter of Saul, a humble farmer, through his ascension to king, wars and madness. After marrying her father's harper / war hero David she helps him escapes her father and for her help gets sold to another man until David's army goes back to reclaim / steal her ten years later only to lock her up in his castle. Even though Michal did not give King David an heir, being the daughter of King Saul she played an important part of legitimizing David's claim to the throne. The author tells the tale while throwing in a dose of political intrigue, adultery, scandals, palace politics as well as sibling rivalry. Ms. Edghill's writing is interesting and she weaves quite a story while letting her imagination flow. The book is not difficult to read and quite appealing but I always felt as if something more interesting could have happened, but didn't - as if the author is setting the reader up for a climax and then pulls back. While I understand the need to take literary license with such stories I feel, as several other reviewers, that some of the finer but important points of the biblical story (such as David and Bathsheba's first born dying) were missing and the author missed the mark on them since they were key points in the lesson of the tale. Since this book is sold under the biblical-fiction and/or historical-fiction categories I would have liked to know more about the daily lives of the people who lived during that time instead of imagined palace life. Also...there were typos which drive me nuts; I hope this was fixed in later editions. Despite the inaccuracies I did enjoy reading the book even though it fell under the \"chick-lit\" category which, honestly, doesn't speak to me."}, {"userName": "Sandie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1331967-sandie", "userReview": "With an abundance of historical and biblical fact, a bit of speculation and a dash of supposition, India Edghill has created an exciting and admirable character in Michal, daughter of Saul (Israel's first King) and first wife of David. We are introduced to Michal first as the na\u00efve farmer's daughter who, through a prophetic event, realizes every young girls dream when she becomes a princess. She meets David, the handsome, charismatic young Shepard and slayer of giants (a man who her father views as a threat to his reign) and is besotted. She becomes David's wife and takes her first steps into a life fraught with equal measures of hope and despair, love and hate, jealousy and intrigue. Caught up a series of events beyond her control, Michal makes the best of every bad situation. The David of Edghill's narrative is not the loving, kind warrior King we were introduced to in Sunday School, but a greedy, ruthless, conniving politician as well as an egotistical and demanding husband. Survival on the throne of Israel is a major achievement, since the palace is a political hotbed of danger and dirty dealings. We watch as Michal slowly transforms into a strong, shrewd and perceptive Queen ........ an observer of human nature and a schemer of sorts who does her best to manipulate each situation then patiently waits for her opportunity to capitalizes on the outcome. Rather than seeing a teenaged Bathsheba as a threat, she befriends the young girl. Later, when Bathsheba gives birth to Solomen, Michal is instrumental in his development offering her guidance and counsel and is ultimately the \"Shepard\" who guides the future King. This is an epic novel about a determined, proud and resilient woman of destiny who would have done well even in today's competitive society.

Narrated in first person Michal narrates the entire story of their relationship from when she volunteered to be David's consolation wife (when her father Saul refused to allow a marriage between David and his elder daughter), to when David fled leaving her behind, their subsequent marriages to other people, David's demand that she return to him, her hatred and resentment towards him, and ultimately her plotting to ensure her foster son Solomon was placed on the throne. This is the story of a woman scorned, of a bitter, angry and resentful woman (who wouldn't be in her shoes?) and how she ultimately finds peace with her life in the freedom of David's death. As she says reflectively in the end about all of David's wives - \"But women's hearts are not trivial playthings, and it is never wise to throw love away - if only because its warmth may be needed in the cold future.\" (365)This certainly was an intriguing spin on King David's story - I certainly hated him all the way through this book. I was curious enough after finishing the book to open up a Bible and read what was written about David and Michal. Edghill weaved a fascinating story by interpreting between the lines. She created a Biblical world that reminded me more of the maneuvering of Queen Elizabeth's court than how I always imagined God's chosen king's court. But - it was believable to me. The concept was good. The story was interesting. I just wish that the book itself was better written and more captivating. It didn't pull me in right away and it took me a couple of starts to actually finish it. If I wasn't personally intrigued by the tie in with King David I probably wouldn't have finished it.

But I also have to believe, I just have to, that not every single man in the history of the universe who was ever in a position of power used that power entirely to make all the women around him miserable. It is so rare to find good, historical fiction that uses actual history properly or finds a way to blend honest humanity within a historical context. I'm totally ranting here but my point is ultimately that we have here yet another quasi historical/biblical female who must rise above the patriarchy for really no reason to essentially get revenge on the man who done her wrong all the while making shockingly revolutionary strides for women everywhere. The entire novel is about this woman trying to get revenge on King David of Israel and its incredibly boring reading.

Unfortunately, it's not anywhere near as good as that book.[return][return]The story is a first-person account of Michal, daughter of King Saul and first wife of David. At heart, it's a story about the power of men and how they abuse that power, and how even repressed women can earn power in their own right. This involves a lot of talking. A lot. Michal is entirely removed from ongoing wars and conflicts, being secluded in the palace; there isn't even much court intrigue except for one other wife who gets snippy on occasion. It ends up being David or Bathsheba talking to Michal while she spins in the garden. That's pretty much it. The material is very interesting, but there was no suspense or conflict. Michal bides her time, waiting to pwn King David the Jerk.

Once I started I was transported by Micah. I found this book to be an accurate record of the timeline of the life of David, and is indeed a work of fiction that brings color and entertainment. Along with each chapter I read the noted scriptures at the beginning of the chapters. I don't agree with Amazon's review stating \"Turning inside out the traditional view of David as a beloved king and gentle author of the Psalms\". The book of Samuel does reflect David as a man of sin...but a man that always turned back to God - \"A man after God's own heart.\" This was not reflected in Ms. Edghill's book. The Bible records David's acknowledgement of his sin in Psalm 51 \"Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love;according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions.2 Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.At the end of his life, (unlike in this work of fiction) David speaks to his son Solomon:1 Kings 22 When the time drew near for David to die, he gave a charge to Solomon his son.2 \u201cI am about to go the way of all the earth,\u201d he said. \u201cSo be strong, act like a man, 3 and observe what the Lord your God requires: Walk in obedience to him, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and regulations, as written in the Law of Moses.

The thing that annoyed me the most about the book is the Biblical inaccuracies. Although the Bible provides many details about David's story, very little is known about Michal and their relationship. Additionally, little is known about Bathsheba. As such, it seems that the author would stick to the few facts provided and use her creativity to fill in the rest. Unfortunately, she seems to have thrown out what little facts we know and changed the past to benefit the narrative. I was also very put off by the characterization of David. While I realize we heard the story from Michal's point of view and her hatred of David caused us to see him through her angry and tormented point of view, I found myself annoyed by this portrait of David that so heavily contradicts the one in the Bible. David's sins and faults are well documented in the Bible, but he is also portrayed as someone who is remorseful and dedicated to his relationship with God. Also, due to some inaccuracies, Nathan is completely discredited as a prophet in the book, which drove me crazy as well. Even if all the inaccuracies were corrected, I still found Michal's fixation with revenge and hatred tiring.

So why not a 5 star rating? I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was refreshing hearing the familiar story through the perspective of David's first wife, Michal. However, I really disliked the author's depiction of King David as a one dimensional character. One of the Bible's most revered and beloved characters is turned into a completely wretched and unlikeable person. The reason David is so beloved is BECAUSE he is such a relatable character. We all can identify with his utterly selfish and at times foolish behavior. However, what is completely missing in this author's version of David is any humility or acknowledgement of God as the authority and Lord of David's life. The very thing that draws us to David is his ability and willingness to humbly come before God and repent when he \"blows it\".

I felt like this story really went off the rails with the complete omission of the birth and death of David and Bathsheba's first child. I assume the author omitted those events to support her assertion later in the story that Nathan's prophecies against David did not come to fruition, which still seemed nonsensical given that David's family was collapsing in on itself and his older children were murdering one another. I also found the author's portrayal of Bathsheba as being eternally innocent and child-like to be somewhat annoying and unbelievable, while her one-dimensional portrayal of David as a delusional egomaniac was a bit over the top.Still, though, I thought it was an interesting read."}, {"userName": "Debra Track", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11276264-debra-track", "userReview": "I enjoyed it. Easy read. Writing was at the level I expected for the \"weight\" of the novel. Some turns of phrase are out of place for the setting of the story bit they didn't bother me nor detract from my enjoyment of the storytelling. One of the elements I did appreciate were the portions of biblical passages at each chapter head. CAVEAT: I'm in NO WAY a religious zealot or anything resembling that ilk AT ALL. I liked these chapter \"starters\" (whatever they're called) simply because as I read the chapter I thought of how much imagination a writer could attach to the few words quoted and the myriad of options to choose from when creating a novel of historical fiction. Comparisons to Diamant's \"The Red Tent\"? Meh, not so much other than genre and choice of protagonist (lesser known woman from the Bible). Edgehill's turn is not as rich as Diamant's. Anyway, it's pleasant beach/holiday reading."}, {"userName": "Deborah Pickstone", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37849334-deborah-pickstone", "userReview": "India Edghill has officially become a favourite author. I really enjoy the recent trend for retelling Biblical stories within novels - it's history and like history; every tale is different, though based on the same meagre facts or records (which may or may not contain anything factual at all). I am, in my poor way, an amateur historian, not a seeker in faith, so I see the stories as more legend - and history - than Word. But I can't deny that my own upbringing was flavoured with Church and my own leanings include theology. So, a novelist such as she who give life and humanity to those figures of the past with such humanity and in so vivid colours - it all contributes, synergistically, to something more than a mere novel, it seems to me."}, {"userName": "Nyneve Beebe", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/407067-nyneve-beebe", "userReview": "I was somewhat concerned going into this book. Having read the little bit of Michal's story that the Bible had to offer, I dreaded what I knew would happen. This was a great story. I knew going into it that it was a fictional account of the life of King David's first wife Michal. I wasn't expecting it to be otherwise. With that in mind, I was able to truly enjoy it for what it was. It also gave me an interesting view of the story. Too many times the women in history are overlooked. People don't realize the influence that they held over major historical events. This book makes you think about it. If you know the bible story, you are open-minded, and you like looking at things in a new way, I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Mimi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2690037-mimi", "userReview": "When I first started this book, I partially expected this novel to take a Harlequin romance detour.
