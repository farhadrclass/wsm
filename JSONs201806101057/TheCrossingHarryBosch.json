Connelly has also demonstrated an ability to branch off and develop additional compelling characters, like Mickey Haller (The Lincoln Lawyer). He\u2019s previously brought Bosch and Haller together and established a link but here, for the first time, he pairs them up to work in unison on a case.The idea of working with Haller to defend a man accused of a brutal murder is initially repellent to Bosch: it goes against the grain and he\u2019s worried about the reaction it will prompt from his ex-colleagues in the LAPD. Suffice to say he sets about satisfying himself that there is justification in committing to this course of action and then jumps right in, neck deep. The plot is as taut as a botoxed forehead and I was riveted throughout as I absorbed the audio version in two long sessions. Bosch is certainly the main act here, with Haller very much in a supporting role. And that\u2019s fine with me. I can think of only a couple of other fictional flatfoots that can compare: James Lee Burke\u2019s Dave Robicheaux and Lawrence Block\u2019s Matt Scudder. I'd quite happily spend a whole reading year working through the novels of this trinity.The only pity is that I guess I've now got to wait another year for another offering from Connelly. Or maybe I should start from the beginning and work my way through them all again..."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "Connelly writes some of the best police procedurals around. Pairing Bosch, with Heller was pure genius. Never one to settle for easy answers, Bosch pursues justice wherever it takes him. He needs to understand how everything is pieced together, find out who is guilty and what they had to gain. Haller, is a master in the courtroom, can use the tiniest bit of information to create doubt and free his client. In this case, thanks to Bosch, temporarily, well maybe, working for the dark side. No longer a detective will he now pursue justice from the other side? Or will he be able to return to his former job? New love interest, maybe?Solid writing, brilliant characters and a great mixing of a legal thriller with a very good police procedure. What's not to like?"}, {"userName": "James Thane", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3483907-james-thane", "userReview": "The twenty-third entry in this excellent series is among the very best, and that's saying quite a lot. As an L.A.P.D. homicide detective, Harry Bosch has pretty much always gone his own way, often alienating his bosses, partners and others, but almost always producing results in the end that no one else could have achieved. Finally, though, he goes a step too far and, although he solves a particularly complex case, his methods give his snarky boss a chance to finally get rid of him. Harry pulls the pin and takes retirement before that can happen and he then sues the department for its actions against him.Harry is now off the job and rebuilding a vintage motorcycle, when his half-brother, Mickey Haller--the \"Lincoln Lawyer\"-- tries to hire him. Mickey has a client who's about to go on trial for a particularly viscous rape and murder. Haller insists that his client is innocent, even though the evidence against him seems a lock.Haller wants Harry to join the defense team and investigate the case in an effort to save his client. To do so goes against the grain of everything Bosch has stood for in his career and he has no interest in helping his brother get a guilty man off on a technicality because of something he might discover. Harry thus refuses, but Mickey convinces him to at least take a look at the Murder Book--the log of the investigation that the police have turned over to the defense. Reading the material, Harry notes a number of minor inconsistencies in the evidence, and once he does, he's hooked. Against his better judgement, he agrees to investigate the case and the deeper he gets, the more complex and dangerous things becomes.This is a very well-written and well-plotted novel. Nobody does police procedural as well as Connelly, and it's a lot of fun watching Harry attempt to pursue the case from outside the police department. It's a standard trope in this sort of novel that the P.I. always has a \"friend\" in the P.D. who looks things up in the computer and who does other favors for him. There's always another \"friend\" in the phone company and so on and so forth, enabling the P.I. to gain access to information that no other outsider could get.Connelly doesn't cheat that way. Harry asks one favor of his old partner who gets him some inside info, but otherwise Harry is on is own and is hugely inventive in developing ways to get the material he needs. He basically starts by pulling at one small loose thread and then follows where it leads him. Watching Bosch work is always a lot of fun, but watching him do so with these limitations is even more so. The plot is gripping and moves like the proverbial runaway train, and it's interesting to see Harry Bosch working at odds against the institution he has served for his entire life. It's also very intriguing to see the two half brothers at work and to watch Harry struggle with his conscience throughout the book. All Mickey really needs is for Harry to find something that will raise a reasonable doubt with the prosecution's case. But Bosch will never forgive himself if that's all he does. If Mickey's client isn't guilty, then someone else is, and Harry Bosch won't rest until he finds him. A great read."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz", "userReview": "Another well done Harry Bosch novel. This time, Harry is playing for the opposing side, helping his half brother Micky Haller. He struggles for a long time with the whole idea of crossing over to the dark side, as he thinks of the defense. As always, this is a convoluted tale with lots of twists and turns. Even though you know who the bad guys are, it's the means by which Harry unravels the clues that provides the intrigue. I listened to the audio book and the narrator does a good job. He even sounds like I would expect Harry to sound. It's not that he attempts to create a different voice for each character. It's just that his voice mirrors how I envision Harry's."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "There is an elegance to this police procedural, but an emotional flatness had me rating it as average among the many great ones in the series. Harry Bosch\u2019s pursuit of small clues slowly begin to open doors on a tough case, and as he gets closer more murders help convince him he is in the right track. But he better put it together fast and good because he is liable to become a target too. He may still be the \u201cLone Coyote\u201d but his teenaged daughter needs him, so he better take care.The brutal rapes and murder of a fashion queen leads to the arrest of a black man who has reformed his life from gang activity in his youth. His DNA from semen is identified at the scene, and his alibi is weak. Harry\u2019s half-brother Mickey Haller (aka \u201cThe Lincoln Lawyer\u201d) is defending this suspect and persuades Harry to consider serving as his investigator on the case. Harry has time on his hands due to a forced retirement, but working for a defense case would ruin his reputation and hurt his chance to get back into the department. Such crossing the line to the dark side is the basis of the book\u2019s title. But the term applies in other clever ways in the investigation. Such as when the victim and perpetrator first cross paths. And when the bad guys first compromise a secondary victim to cross the line into playing ball with their corrupt sceme.The bad guys in this case are vice squad cops, which we soon learn by the narrative technique of showing some of their activities out of Harry\u2019s purview. The story lies not in a \u201cwho done it\u201d but in watching how the detective in action puts it together while we watch the danger he is inexorably coming into. It\u2019s great to see how Harry\u2019s mind works. I just wanted more of a window into his soul. Often corruption among the police brings out a lot of angst and paranoia that undercuts a detective\u2019s hold on life and figures into the classic noir aspect of such tales. Harry is in some cerebral plane above all that, so it was hard to get emotionally engaged in his condition. Still, it was a great story which came to an exciting and surprising crescendo. We don\u2019t get a lot on what matters in Harry\u2019s life, so the little windows such as texting with his daughter at camp, playing a certain jazz record, or small elements of dialog with police members he respects have to serve as minimalist clues to my detective work on that score as a reader."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24360539-thomas", "userReview": "I really enjoy reading Michael Connelly's books. This is a 5 star read. You learn early on who the bad guys are but all the various threads in the plot come together gradually in a very satisfying conclusion. Harry Bosch is asked by his half brother, Mickey Haller, a lawyer, to become his new investigator. Haller's previous investigator, Cisco, was badly injured when a car cut off his motorcycle in traffic. Haller is convinced his client, Da'Quan Foster is innocent of the murder that he is accused of.  Harry doesn't want to become a defense investigator, viewing it as crossing to the dark side, but agrees to look at the murder book as a favor to Mickey. When he reads the murder book, he finds discrepancies and leads not followed up. How he unravels this case makes a well written thriller, so much so that I read the last 180 pages in one day."}, {"userName": "L.A.

A few political glitches that maybe half or less of readers will notice.

He\u2019s not going out quietly and has hired brother Mickey Haller to represent him in his suit against the city. When Mickey asks him to serve as his investigator for a client he\u2019s certain is innocent, obviously Harry is reluctant to play on the team for the \u201cother side\u201d but agrees to look into it for him. The more he probes, the more he\u2019s convinced that Mickey\u2019s client was set up to cover up something much more sinister. When I learned that Harry and Mickey would be teamed for this story I set my expectations pretty high and they were surpassed. This was skilled writing because the Haller stories have a much different vibe from the Bosch ones but Connelly effectively integrated the two. The case was intricate, not one where you could easily make the connections. Typical Harry pulls a seemingly innocuous thread, doggedly pursuing it until the case breaks open. But, the highlight of this story was seeing how Harry and Mickey\u2019s styles connect and clash. It was a big risk for Harry to agree to work with him because he\u2019ll be forever persona non grata with his brothers in law enforcement, no matter the outcome. Welliver delivers a fine performance in his narration, continuing to nail Bosch. I really loved this story and am anxious for what\u2019s next for Harry."}, {"userName": "Alex is The Romance Fox", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6663962-alex-is-the-romance-fox", "userReview": "Okay, I must be honest and admit that I was a bit apprehensive where Harry Bosch would go next after the last book, The Burning Room. Michael Connelly\u2019s Harry Bosch Series is one of my favorite crime series and I always eagerly wait for the next installment.So, The Crossing, the 20th book in the series takes us on Harry Bosch, the maverick cop now forced with early retirement from the LAPD\u2026new career move.Unable to bear with nothing to do in his life, he decides to take on an investigation for his half-brother, Mickey Haller, the slick and not your typical defense lawyer. Harry has doubts about doing anything for defense lawyers as he believes that he\u2019s betraying the side he has always believed in\u2026i.e. the police force.Mickey Haller is convinced his client has been framed for a murder he did not commit and he asks Harry to do a bit of investigation into the case. Harry begins to see some discrepancies that worry him.The more he finds out about the case, the more he\u2019s convinced that there may be corrupt cops involved in setting up Mickey\u2019s client.I enjoyed seeing Harry work through the clues and information and how he follows the trails leading to some unexpected discoveries. He may now be retired but his skills at looking at every little piece of evidence are still top notch.His daughter lives with him and their relationship is a bit strained at the moment. His love life is in a bit of a limbo after the breakup of the relationship he\u2019s been in for a while\u2026.hopefully we get him to see more of someone he meets up with again.Naturally, he\u2019s still listening to jazz!!! And still living in his amazing house in the hills.This is the new and reinvented iconic Harry Bosch and still, after all these years, bringing magic to his fans.Just a mention that I loved the TV Harry Bosch series Season 1 and hopefully we will get more in the future."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5240149-brenda", "userReview": "I knew that Harry had retired from LAPD and was curious how that was going to work out in this book.

It remains to be seen if Harry wins his lawsuit, and I have no idea where Connelly is headed with Harry next.The one irritant for me in this book is Maddy. I really don't like her attitude.

I am so familiar and comfortable with this character I could enjoy reading his shopping list but don't worry this book has a decent plot as well. Having finished with the Police, Harry Bosch joins forces with the Lincoln Lawyer Mickey Haller to defend Leland Foster, from being convicted of a brutal murder. Harry Bosch is in great form ably assisted by Mickey as he leads the fight to clear Leland Foster's name. These books can be read as stand alone's but work far better reading them in order to build up the bond with the main characters and keep up with the sub plots as the characters develop.Although I appreciate the Alex Cross series by James Patterson, this series cannot be seriously compared. While Patterson books are always full of action, Connelly offers so much more, realistic plots, strong characters and to be honest the books are far better written.If you have enjoyed reading other books in this series I am sure you will enjoy this one as well.

If you are a Michael Connelly follower, this is like being served breakfast in bed. The coffee is steaming hot and the eggs are as light as an angel's wings. It's deeply satisfying.Connelly brings our two favorites together in a storyline that sparks like a tragic tango on a Saturday night. It's all in the foot placement. Harry Bosch, forcibly retired from the LAPD, is still licking deep wounds when he is approached by his half-brother, Mickey Haller, the famous/infamous Lincoln Lawyer. Haller tries to rope Bosch into using his stellar investigative skills to prove or disprove the guilt of Haller's client. It's rape and it's murder and there's vibrating DNA involved.The title of the book is filled with characters crossing back and forth into both light and dark, certainty and uncertainty. The storyline showcases more of Bosch's brilliance while Haller drifts in on cue. Connelly is a master of analysis and investigative art. The Crossing delivers.

I have read every book in the series, and The Crossing is another strong addition. In this latest one, Bosch has been fired from the LAPD for things that happened in the last instalment of the series, and he crosses over to help investigate a case his half brother defence lawyer Mickey Haller is working on. Haller's client is accused of a brutal murder that is based on DNA evidence. Haller is convinced that his client didn't do it, and he hires Bosch to find out who did. Bosch is reluctant to cross the line to work on the defence side, but he comes round when he becomes convinced that Haller's client didn't do it and then gets into full cop mode to figure out who did. It's not really a mystery from the reader's perspective because from early on Connelly introduces a parallel narrative from the perspective of the murderers. As the book progresses, we see the back and forth between what's really going on and what Bosch figures out. Connelly is in his usual fine form. He keeps the series fresh by putting Bosch in a different situation, and it really works. Bosch struggles with his role of investigating for the defence. He also forgets himself a few time, acting more like a cop than a PI. It's a great concept, a complex story and as usual delivered with a keen eye on what makes people do what they do -- good, bad and ugly, delivered with pretty much no romance."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "All My Friends are Heathens, Take it Slow\nConnelly still has the magic touch with Harry Bosch. To be sure, Connelly takes shortcuts and makes a couple of turns of story that seem a bit implausible. Yet, Bosch is such an intriguing, cool and quick-witted character, so damaged he seems real and you care what happens.I find the Bosch books like comfort or soul food; no matter how the story is wrapped, you'll revel as you binge, not stopping (if you can help it) 'til you're finished.This, the latest Harry Bosch novel, considerably betters the prior in the series, The Burning Room. Here, Bosch, a retired LAPD detective, steps in to take on a job as PI to help his attorney half-brother Mickey Haller defend a client against a murder charge. After an initial review of the \"murder book,\" Bosch takes the job, but very reluctantly because he doesn't want to offend his former comrades in the force or his \"cop principles\" by \"crossing\" over to the other side. Ultimately though, Bosch self-rationalizes that if the client didn't commit the murder, he wants to bring to justice the murderer, who must still be on the loose.As always, Connelly keeps the current of electric suspense flowing for most of the book, and even throws in a little over-the-hill romance to boot.

Okay, yes, I will fully admit that his Bosch novels are my favorites (I love his Mickey Haller ones, too, but nowhere near as much as the Bosch ones) so I was already essentially guaranteed to love it.But The Crossing is different than the others. Obviously, since Harry's now retired, it's not going to be a police procedural like the others. But arguably an even bigger change is that he's helping Mickey (his half-brother) on a case...which is a huge shock. (It's not even something he swore he'd never do because it never occurred to him that he'd ever even consider working for a defense attorney.) But when Mickey swore that his client was innocent, that the real killer is still out there...well, that gets Harry Bosch interested.Even so---and even when he agrees that DaQuan didn't do it---Harry almost hates himself for helping the defense.That alone makes this a must-read...except that it's not just that; this has everything you'd expect from a Michael Connelly novel going for it. The story is fantastic and good luck putting it down.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Rex Fuller", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11874992-rex-fuller", "userReview": "This whipped by in nothing flat.

The client and Haller say he\u2019s innocent. Bosch soothes his conscience by telling himself if the client is really innocent someone else is guilty and Bosch needs to take him off the street. That doesn\u2019t quite wash with Bosch\u2019s daughter. He had told her that he would never work for the dark side. So, Bosch has to find the \u201creal\u201d killer but Haller just has to show that his client didn\u2019t do it. Those two things don\u2019t always keep them on the same page.

Mickey Haller, Harry Bosch, Titus Welliver, and Michael Connelly fans will devour THE CROSSING, (Harry Bosch, #20) expertly crafted by the \"King\" of Crime Thrillers. Who is using whom? Detective Hieronymus 'Harry' Bosch, a literary character created by Connelly in 1992 novel  The Black Echo,  and a veteran police homicide detective with the LAPD. Bosch was named after the 15th century Dutch artist, Hieronymus Bosch.Defense attorney Michael \"Mickey\" Haller, Jr. Lincoln Lawyer  is Harry Bosch\u2019s half-brother. He needs his help. Harry also needs Mickey\u2019s assistance. They bond in other ways, with daughters the same age--heading off to college soon, as roommates.At the conclusion of The Burning Room,  Bosch was suspended from the LAPD on a trumped-up complaint. He knew this would take time; no money coming in and his daughter about go to off to college--he decided to take early retirement. (Yes, once again). Of course all he has in mind is the restoration of a 1950 Harley, and not much else. However, he needs Haller\u2019s help with his lawsuit against the LAPD.On the other hand,  Haller needs Bosch\u2019s help even more. He is involved in an upcoming murder trial. He has nothing. Cisco, is laid up after a motorcycle accident, so he cannot help. The trial is coming up in six weeks. Haller says his client is innocent; however, he needs Bosch\u2019s expertise. However, Bosch is not interested. No way, he can cross to the other side. He has always been on the other side of the law. Lexi Parks,  a city employee married to a police officer, was raped and beaten to death in her own bed, so viciously--her husband found the body when he came home from work. His client has no alibi \u2013except in his studio painting. A brutal murder. A sex crime, DNA, a setup, a fix\u2014how did DNA get inside the victim? No motive. Has the killer got enough to set up an innocent man? Sex is motive enough. Taint the evidence? His gut tells him something is wrong. However, Haller is keeping secrets  of his own, in order to get Bosch on board, a homicide investigator. In or out? Bosch wants no part of this case. A cop for nearly 30 years, working for the defense-- is a line he cannot cross. However, if Haller is right, and his client is innocent, there could be a guilty party out there who goes free. Maybe he will take a look. It begins and ends with the book (the murder book).He finally says if nothing jumps out, he is not in. He is about \"the killer.\" Da'Quan Foster, a reformed gang member who did prison time for drugs years earlier but has since found success as a self-taught artist and arts educator. He's a husband and father. He has no apparent connection to Parks. But he has been charged with her murder. He does not know her. The husband was cleared. Something does not add up. Bosch sees the guy as a criminal. He is unimpressed at first. Bosch knows every trick in the book to planning misdirection\u2014a pro at causing nightmares when turning discovery process for a defense attorney. He knows all the tactics of a police investigation. If you know Bosch, you know there will be no stone left, unturned. Now he is looking for cop screw ups.With the help  of his former LAPD partner, Lucia Soto, The Burning Room he turns the investigation inside to the police department\u2014however, the closer he gets to the truth, the greater the danger. A clue. A watch. A complex plot of blackmail, murder, and corruption. The inside cop procedures are juicy good!As we have found in previous books, Bosch is sharp, he has investigative skills like no other. However, here he does not have all the resources available to him, as with the LAPD. Even though we all love Haller and his courtroom tactics, Connelly allows Bosch to take center stage in THE CROSSING, so as not compete with one another. A perfect mix, and as always Connelly never ceases to amaze. \"Bosch,\" Amazon Prime's series  starring Titus Welliver, is brilliant--to have him as narrator, of the audiobook, really sets the mood--what is better than Connelly, Bosch, Haller, and Welliver in one collaboration? You feel as though you are watching season 2. Titus Welliver  is a perfect Harry-- Amazon Studios \"Bosch\" Season 2 will debut early in 2016  can\u2019t wait\u2014in the meantime watch Season 1. \u2013 A great match, as is Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey) Lincoln Lawyer, and Terry McCaleb (Clint Eastwood) Blood Work.  When I finished THE CROSSING,  was inspired to head back to Amazon and catch up with a few episodes to remind me how this character started (been so long ago since I read the first in the series). Connelly just keeps getting better! \u201cCROSSING\u201d  has many meanings in the novel:\u2022 Crossing into retirement; the adjustment\u2022 Bridging the gap; while trying to settle his own case \u2022 Paths of victim and killer; (predator/prey) \u2022 Crossing into the defense side of law\u2022 A Jane Fonda (Crossing sides), a line he cannot cross\u2022 Crossing from former LAPD, to citizen, to investigator\u2022 From putting away criminals; to trying to save them \u2022 Prosecution versus defense\u2022 Crossing a line to expose the truth \u2022 A new career-reinvention\u2022 To gain trust; to convince-crossing a line Sure there are many more . . Being at \"this age\" without the LAPD, Bosch is just as intriguing, and sexy as ever. Enjoy seeing a man\u2019s journey, at this age (as a woman the same age), he has too much to offer to sit on the sidelines. Connelly has taken this character, throughout this series\u2014making each fresh, with even more room to go --the possibilities are endless and exciting. Hope we continue to see more of both.Can\u2019t wait to see  which direction Connelly takes with the next installment\u2014a possible love connection? Will he really retire? Let\u2019s hope not. I am all about reinvention . . A new career as a private investigator? YES! Curious to see if Grisham will take Rogue Lawyer, star Sebastian Rudd, renegade lawyer (similar to Mickey Haller) as far as Connelly has with Haller/Bosch? Only time will tell.

And, since this is book 20, have I only a few books to tackle. However, it was absolutely no problem to read this book without having read the 18 books between the first and this one. On the contrary, it was very easy to get hooked and it took just one day to finish reading it, both because the book was so easy to read (and not so thick), and that the story was interesting.Harry has now retired, a somewhat forced retirement. However, it does not seem that he will find time to tinkering with the motorcycle that has been waiting for him for a few decades. His half-brother needs help. A client of his is accused of murder and although it at first troubles Harry to help a defense lawyer is he soon caught up in the case. Especially when he discovers that something is not right. But, there are those who are not at all amused that Harry has started to investigate the murder...I really liked the book, as I mentioned before it was very easy to read, not an overly complicated story and I like Harry and Mickey very much. I have for a long time had plans to continue reading the series since I liked the first book enough to wanting to know more, but I just have not had time for it. It was fun to read this book, I feel like I should take and prioritize Connelly and perhaps actually take the time and read the 18 books I missed.Thanks to Norstedts for the review copy!"}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara", "userReview": "Harry Bosch has lost his job as a homicide detective for the LAPD (again) and is at loose ends. At the same time Harry's half-brother, attorney Mickey Haller (The Lincoln Lawyer), is defending former gang member Da'Quan Foster, who's accused of raping and murdering assistant city manager Lexi Park. Mickey is convinced his client was set up and asks Harry to look into the case. Harry refuses because the idea of 'crossing' from catching criminals to helping them get off is abhorrent to him. Nevertheless, Harry takes a look at the LAPD's murder book and gets an inkling that Da'Quan might actually be innocent. The clue that intrigues Harry most is Lexi's expensive watch, which is missing. Meanwhile, two LAPD detectives have an inordinate interest in the Lexi Park case. They spy on Mickey and Harry, stop Mickey for a bogus DUI so they can search his car, and track the half-brothers with GPS devices. Then, when Harry starts to investigate the missing watch, more people are murdered. It's clear that something is rotten in the LAPD.The book moves along at a steady clip as Harry uncovers one clue after another, and builds to a satisfying climax. Full disclosure: I did get a tad impatient with a couple of sections about LAPD parking lots and gangs surveilling them, but this is a minor quibble.The secondary characters add interest to the book, including Harry's daughter Maddie - who's preparing for college, Harry's former partner Lucia - who secretly lends him a hand, and an Internal Affairs investigator that Harry has sparks with. The last part of the book has some juicy courtroom scenes (courtesy of Mickey Haller), which is icing on the cake of a good detective novel. I enjoyed the book and recommend it to mystery lovers - especially fans of Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller."}, {"userName": "&#x1f52e;\u26a1\ufe0fVoracious", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45724173-x1f52e-voracious", "userReview": "I\u2019ve been riding with Harry Bosch for the best part of 4 months now, starting more than 20 years back with his first outing in The Black Echo. I\u2019ve become so immersed in Harry\u2019s world that I now believe him to be much more than simply a fictional character, albeit one of the most fascinating I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure to read. To me, he has become real and I\u2019m very aware of the utter despair that I feel, knowing that I\u2019m coming to the end of this wonderful series. Michael Connelly has created something amazing in Harry Bosch. Twenty books into a series and I\u2019m craving more. Gosh, I\u2019m usually bored by any series beyond book three. That\u2019s how I know this series is a special one. I was quite literally giddy when I discovered that this particular book - The Crossing - featured Bosch\u2019s half brother, the notorious Lincoln Lawyer, Mickey Haller. It was the burning question I had as I went into this book - what is Harry going to do now that\u2019s he\u2019s left LAPD? Connelly cracked it. Pair Bosch and Haller up. A dream team for sure. However, as successful as their partnership was, Harry is determined that the side of the Defence isn\u2019t for him. So what\u2019s next for Harry? Onto book 21 in the series for my answer. Wherever he goes next and whatever he ends up doing, I can only hope that he does it for many more books to come. I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without Harry Bosch in my life. I make no apologies for enthusiastically gushing on about this series. If you have read Michael Connelly, then you\u2019ll surely appreciate why. If you haven\u2019t, then you\u2019re sincerely missing out. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13454748-robin", "userReview": "Defense attorney Mickey Haller asks a favor of his half-brother, Harry Bosch. Mickey's client, Da'Quann Foster, was arrested for the rape and murder of Lexi Parks. Mickey believes that his client is innocent and the evidence against him was planted. He asks Bosch to look into the murder and help him find evidence that will lead to reasonable doubt. Harry is reluctant to get involved. As an ex-LAPD Detective, he has seen other cops go to the other side of the aisle and lost respect for them. But when he reads the murder book, he has some questions that he wants answered. Not only does he think that Foster may be innocent, but he wants to find the real killer.I love that Connelly put both Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller in this book.

Normally I avoid to put a book on my TBR so much time in advance. But really, come on, Harry Bosch!!!! Ok, Mickey Haller's there as well :)Nov. 5, 2015:Short question: anybody else got 'The Brass Verdict' delivered with this kindle edition???So, finished! Great story (won't go into details as everyone is able to either just read the blurb or read the whole thing for themselves), couldn't put it down and to be honest? I hope, Haller and Bosch will work more cases together. Yes, Haller was part of the story, but overall it was Bosch who was in the focus. And that was ok and appreciated by this reader :)I liked the way the daughter was mentioned and part of the story. What I didn't need was the emerging build-up to another relationship in the future for Bosch. (Reminded me of the development in the Inspector Banks series that I didn't really like, but that's probably just me.)I have to say - after watching the amazon series with Titus Welliver and, while watching, thinking that I had a totally different image in my head for Bosch - while reading this book, well, Mr. Welliver was present. The whole time."}, {"userName": "Obsidian", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian", "userReview": "This book feels pretty fragmented to me. I think Connelly missed a great chance to showcase both Bosch and Haller in this one. Instead we primarily follow Bosch around as he acts like he is being tortured to investigate a case for Haller. And we weirdly have POV's showing the killers in this one so you don't have any kind of surprise when Bosch eventually finds out what is going on. I really hate mystery books that do this since you as a reader are just waiting for the protagonist to catch a clue about what is happening. I hope this is not a new thing that Connelly is going to include in the Bosch series. I feel like I am missing a book between this and \"The Burning Room.\" We have a Bosch who is officially retired again, but is also suing the LAPD since he believes he was set up to lose the money that was owed to him when he came back under the Deferred Retirement Option Plan that the LAPD started. Bosch's half brother, Mickey Haller (The Lincoln Lawyer) has taken up Bosch's case and believes that in the end that he will get Bosch a great settlement. Bosch though is at loose ends and has no idea what to do with himself. Haller then meets with Bosch and asks him to take a case investigating for him. Haller believes his client is innocent and that he is being set up by the police. Bosch of course doesn't believe this, because the LAPD is always on the side of truth and justice (honestly this whole thing throughout the book with Bosch not wanting to work for a defense attorney was a crock to me) and refuses to officially investigate, but will take a look at what Haller has. I totally just lowered this book another star because I found my ire rising just typing. Look, I don't know who this Bosch is that Connelly is now writing. But look at how many cases Bosch was involved with that involved the LAPD doing something not sanctioned and or criminal? It doesn't ring true at all with him being reluctant to investigate. He is supposed to be the one that cares about making sure the truth is found. Heck, that was the main premise behind \"The Drop\" was that Bosch was brought in by his main nemesis in the series (Irving) to look into Irving's son's death. Irving doesn't like Bosch, but does not believe he would be used by the police in order to make Irving look bad. To me, Bosch's reluctance to take this case up investigating for Haller does not ring true. And also reading pages and pages of Bosch studying the case, looking at photos, and a murder book do not a good book make. This book was boring from beginning to end even with what was going on.We have appearances by characters that long-term readers should know by now: Maddie, Lucia Soto, and a woman that was investigating Bosch in \"The Black Box\" and his love interest from the last book too. Maddie still sucks so it was not awesome reading about her. She acts like Bosch is a serial killer or worse because he is investigating a case for the defense. Which of course begs the question of how Maddie treats her cousin (Haller's daughter) when no one is around.The writing was not as clean in this one. I honestly think the whole book just dragged. I did get my interest peaked a bit with Haller. But Connelly has me wondering what his deal is. Haller sounds like a creep who drinks and hits on women who are interested in him. I never got that impression from the movie (The Lincoln Lawyer). My plan was to read the Mickey Haller series and the books that showcase him and Bosch together after I got caught up on the Bosch series. Now I am kind of reluctant to even do that.I have to say though that the ending for Connelly I guess was happy. We have Bosch interested in another woman, his daughter actually proud of him and not acting like a brat, and Bosch content that he did something that ended up being the right thing. I don't get a sense of anything from Haller with this one unfortunately."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28831526-jean", "userReview": "In The Crossing, Michael Connelly\u2019s 20th Harry Bosch detective novel, Harry pulls what cops call a \u201cJane Fonda.\u201d Having recently retired from LAPD and still enmeshed in a lawsuit against his former employer, the long-time homicide detective crosses over to \u201cthe dark side\u201d to investigate a case for his half-brother, defense attorney Mickey Haller. This is no easy task for Bosch, who is sure that his former colleagues, and even his daughter Maddie, will look upon him with scorn. What finally convinces him is the realization that if Da\u2019Quan \u201cDQ\u201d Foster didn\u2019t commit the murder he\u2019s accused of, someone is out walking the streets, free to kill again.This book is part police procedural \u2013 even though Bosch no longer wears a badge, he still thinks like a cop. It is also part legal thriller, with Haller challenging Bosch\u2019s police tactics at every turn. It\u2019s an interesting pairing. Harry swears that it\u2019s his first and only crossing into the world of the defense. As a private investigator, Harry has a lot to learn. Without police privilege, he doesn\u2019t have the same access to records or witnesses, and he makes mistakes, some of them potentially costly. However, his experience proves invaluable to Haller as well. Will it be enough to prove his client\u2019s innocence?From the onset, we know who\u2019s responsible, and as Harry continues to pound the pavement and use his wits as well as call on some contacts within the department, we see how he cleverly puts together the pieces that might be the answer he is looking for. The problem is that he is up against some nasty guys. It was impressive to note how Connelly built this investigation step-by-step and made it all fit. I could see where it was going quite early on, but it was fascinating to read! I admire the complexity of the plot and the fact that it moves so fluidly without rushing or skipping over details. Bosch isn't the only one who crosses to \"the dark side,\" and the final chapters provide a flurry of tension and action.Bosch is fantastic! He surprises himself by making his police training work for the defendant. Once he commits, he is all in. I have to wonder if he will stay retired, or what will come next. I can\u2019t wait! Mickey Haller is a flamboyant showboat, but he does seem to care about his brother, and he is also very good at what he does. He\u2019s the kind of lawyer that cops seem to hate. I was happy to see Harry\u2019s last police partner, Lucia Soto, in this book, despite the fact that her role was limited. I also loved the name of the investigator whom Harry was filling in for, Cisco Wojciechowski (watch-your-house-key). We actually meet him briefly, and I wonder if there\u2019s any more Cisco in future books. His teenage daughter is moody, as usual, but winds up pretty proud of her old man. And perhaps there\u2019s a budding romance for Hieronymus Bosch also? Some authors seem to get boring by the time they reach double-digit numbers in a series. Not Michael Connelly. More Bosch, please!5 stars"}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8386404-richard", "userReview": "7.5/10Another Bosch, another win. Bosch is back as a PI after leaving the force but rather than retire by going golfing or fishing he decides to help his half brother, defense lawyer Mickey Halley, by getting a guy out of prison. This is tantamount to taking a shit on his police badge and causes enough angst for Bosch on how he can do this. He finds the right reasons in the end and it all leads to another solid mystery. I personally was hoping for more Mickey Haller than we got in this one but it\u2019s a majority Bosch outing and Haller is more a second fiddle character. Bosch is his new role added a new dimension to his character not seen since about ten books ago when he left the force for a short time. Bosch is always worth reading whatever he\u2019s doing and this was no exception. The main reason for the slight lower rating than the other more recent Bosch readings were the villains who seemed to come out of a bad action movie. The two bad guys going all out to cover things up (I\u2019ll say no more for fear of spoilers). Only two left in this series for me to get up to speed.
