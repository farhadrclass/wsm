Right from the first chapter I was hooked & wanted to read on. I needed to find out more about Shannon's past and then theres Seth with those stunningly gorgeous blue eyes who after the death of his wife & child became completely separated from society. He cannot remember why the accident happened that day and the town people believe he deliberately murdered his family due to rumors of his wife having an affair with his childhood friend Joseph.As soon as Shannon & Seth locked eyes in the diner they were drawn to each other. Their relationship is intense from the start & they cannot seem to control themselves around each other as their passion burns deep. Shannon confides in Seth revealing how she ended up in a 10 year abusive marriage to a man she didn't love and the terrible things he would subject her to.Shannon's finally making a new life for herself in Sanctuary with Seth, the man she is deeply in love with when things take a sudden turn. Shannon can tell theres something not quite right with Joseph!! and thats all I can say about it without spoiling it for everyone. But lets just say it had me on the edge of my seat and I stayed up really late turning the pages as quickly as I could to find out what was going to happen next.This book is about two people overcoming the traumatic events of their past and being awakened again by the passion, desire & love they have for eachother."}, {"userName": "(Kelly)~Got Fiction?~ Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2376667-kelly-got-fiction-oakes", "userReview": "First off, bear with me while I explain the 2 star rating I gave this book. I enjoyed the book as a whole well enough, but some of the thinking behind the storyline had me on a rollercoaster of emotions, ranging from confused to a bit upset.We open with what appears to be a hippie type, RV driving traveler named Shannon Mallory who stumbles across a small town named Sanctuary. This is good base and very interesting in the beginning. Shannon has a past, and most of us can relate to her character; having parts of our own past that we feel best left forgotten. In the first 100 pages of this book you are in a state of euphoria and bliss right alongside our heroine. Heather finds a job, meets new friends, discovers love at first sight, falls head over heels, has an accident, moves in with her beau, \u201csigh\u201d\u2026 yes, all this in the first 100 pages! There was so much crammed into the beginning of this book, I actually thought it could have been split into two separate novels with a little elaboration. Once past the first 100 pages of \u201chappy happy Care Bear land\u201d the author created, the book started to get interesting. The great moments had suspense, intrigue and a frightening villain. When it was good, it was great: But when it was bad, it was just that. I am definitely a fan of sex and intimacy in a book, but there is a time and place for everything. Case in point (without giving away too much), a female is kidnapped and taken. She is chained, starving and being tormented mentally and physically by her captor. After a brutal session of her captor\u2019s advances, she dreams that her lover will save her\u2026 she decides at that very moment to \u201cknock one off\u201d, yes that means masturbate. NOT an appropriate time.Our hero Seth was the star of this book. He was sexy, mysterious and I wanted to know more. He\u2019d been estranged from his Native American roots and with the gentle coaxing of Shannon; he begins to bridge the gap that had plagued him for years. Unimaginable circumstances make him turn to the medicine man of his tribe and really find himself. I would have liked to share more of this link with Seth. The author had the bait set and I was on the hook, but she failed to reel this reader in. This book had a serious case of, I don\u2019t know what to write here, let\u2019s add a sex scene! I would classify this book as a Romantic Thriller that has so much potential, but just fell short. The writing was choppy and bounced back in forth, not allowing the scenes to seamlessly flow from one to another.Now for the part where I got upset, weather I draws from personal experience or not is not the point, but I must make one.When a traumatic experience (death, rape, abduction, molestation, kidnapping, torture, etc\u2026) happens in a woman\u2019s or man\u2019s life: there\u2019s absolutely no way, no matter the current bliss, that the victim thinks; I want to return to the scene of the crime later to spend vacations, family time or simply to enjoy the view in springtime? I\u2019m not trying to be harsh, be true love could never erase something so horrific from one\u2019s mind. This novel had good bones, good intentions and potential. This is my personal opinion only and I ask that everyone must judge for themselves if this book is for them or not. All I can offer is an honest review.P.Q. Glisson, thank you for the opportunity to take a look at your work. Please forge on and continue your journey, your future as a writer is destined to be great."}, {"userName": "Michelle, the Bookshelf Stalker  Queen of the Undead", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3039709-michelle-the-bookshelf-stalker-queen-of-the-undead", "userReview": "I am not into pure romance stories. I\u2019m also usually very suspicious of stories where the main female character instantly falls in love even though she has a horrible abusive past (including almost being killed). I was seriously worried when I started the book, skeptical and usually I would put the book down at this point. However, I was compelled to give the book a chance. I kept on reading and I was not disappointed. I loved the story and the setting. The author is successful in making me want to like Shannon and Seth. In fact, I was physically smiling at points in the book and fearing for Shannon and Seth in other parts.The switch between viewpoints was confusing especially at the beginning. I had a difficult time following the story and the action seemed choppy at points.

The characters of Seth and Shannon seemed to take on a life of their own. Their passion was breathtaking and beautiful to watch. Shannon's struggle to escape from an abusive ten year marriage was heartbreaking while Seth's guilt at the deaths of his wife and child made you want to hold him and comfort him. His imperfectly beautiful face and well formed physique made you want to hold him for a totally different reason. There are also the cast of characters that lend comic relief to the story while the villian, who will stop at nothing to get what he wants, makes your skin crawl.I read the book at least four times and I can tell you, even though I knew how it would end, I always seemed to find myself crying as I read the last page, every single time. One person said that it is a story of healing and learning to trust and love again. Compassionate and romantic from the beginning, you will be \"hooked\".

Problems with this book:Takes place in present day United States. The protagonist's \"loving\" parents sold her to an old man when she was sixteen. That means they weren't loving parents. Please don't describe them as loving parents. Toward the end of the book, protagonist gets kidnapped. The male character (hereafter called \"hero\") rescues her by taking a pony into the wilderness, digesting a concoction given to him by a medicine man, then astral projecting to find her location. He then traverses the snowy wilderness for days until he reaches her and rescues her from a pending sexual assault. They lock up the bad guy in the same room he had kept her captive then they proceed make the cabin their home. They radio the police force already looking for the captor (because they have video evidence of all his crimes) and they all agree that protagonist and hero boyfriend will remain at the cabin with the bad guy for a few months until travel is safe. They never a discuss the obvious solution of bringing a helicopter into the mix. Protagonist is totally cool with the whole situation because she really likes the cabin and apparently has no issues at all with the fact that she has been imprisoned there for the past week or month or however long. Not only is she cool with it, she dresses up for the hero in lingerie type outfits purchased for her by the bad buy as part of his plans to keep her as a sex slave. But her man is here now and that guy is chained up in another room so I guess everything is good. The whole thing was extremely convoluted. Sadly, as stupid as the whole cabin captivity turned to lover's retreat was, it was the only time in the book something was happening. And we were already about 80% of the way through the book when the captivity started. So here's the timeline:Beginning of book : character comes to town, is sort of adopted by a couple running a diner and told about this super reclusive outcast guy that everyone in the town hates except for the diner couple. A few pages in: protagonist meets loner, they fall in love and talk a lot about how much they love each otherEighty percent in: kidnapping, wilderness, astral projection, rescue, captor becomes the captive, lingerie, etcAlso, at some point a werewolf shows up for no reason whatsoever. Its gone a paragraph later.If this book ever comes up on a kindle freebie list, I still wouldn't recommend it."}, {"userName": "Ellen Maze", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2898778-ellen-maze", "userReview": "\"Sanctuary\" is a town where, after escaping the sexual abuse of her husband, Shannon lands while checking off items on her bucket-list. What happens when she moves in, finds a job, and meets Seth is what becomes \"our\" sanctuary of entertainment and thrills.Most everyone who has reviewed this book agrees that Seth (the hero) is the most compelling character of all. His good looks, his brooding way, his tragic past -- all combine to make us fall for him at least as hard as Shannon does in this book. I missed him when he wasn't in the scene and rejoiced when he returned. Shannon was also complex and well-written. Most women have suffered some form of sexual abuse in their lifetimes, and in the least, known someone who has, and so that is why we pull for her as she goes through the tough tribulations thrown at her when she is kidnapped and held hostage by Seth's rival.The dangerous situation Shannon finds herself in and Seth's desperation to find her take the reader on a thrill ride only after we have fallen in love with both characters so much that we can't bear to see them apart. On the whole, this book moves very fast and I was never bored. Between keeping a wary eye on the bad guy and trying to keep up with Seth and Shannon's growing adoration for each other, there was never a dull moment. As for the sex: Since my own readership ranges from pre-teen to adult (and they read my reviews of other books looking for recommendations), I feel I need to address the sexual content of the book. Some reviewers found the sex offensive, but I knew I was reading a romance and I was prepared for it. I think anyone who has ever read a romance will find that this one is done well and with tenderness and care. I personally recommend this book to people 18+ who appreciate romantic thrillers.My verdict? A 5 - star novel for adults. I look forward to seeing what P.Q.

Then she totally pulls an all out surprise in the middle and to the end, she takes this story on a turn into an almost thriller/action story. I was highly impressed with Glisson's skills and think she could eventually tackle any genre out there. I also have to say that she can actually write extremely visual action sequences.

It's about finding someone that makes you want to breath again. It's about second chances and the life you were meant to live.Seth and Shannon's story is both heartbreaking and exhilarating. This is a love story that I wont soon forget.At first I wasn't sure about this particular kind of writing style as we get multiple pov's from different characters, sometimes at once. While it did invade some of the mystery, I still found this technique refreshing as it gave us incredible insight to all of the main and secondary characters. I also found the relationship to be totally and completely rushed, but it's for a reason and actually worked in it's favor for this kind of plot-line.Shannon and Seth both have an equally devastating past so when they meet they are desperate, emotionally raw, and scared to death to just believe, so they cling to each other with every fiber of there being. So, yes, there relationship is indeed rushed, but for a very good reason and eventually it didn't seem to matter anymore. I was completely invested in these characters that I felt compelled to know there story.And WOW, what a story!!These characters have the kind of heat that is overpowering and all-consuming. The electricity between them is steamy-hot, candy-apple sweet dialog and then steamy-hot all over again;)But the road to true love is not a smooth one, and Shannon and Seth still have a few obstacles in there way.All in all I thought this was a beautiful story of two souls that have been through so much in there lives, as they find comfort and healing in each others arms.There story is unforgettable, heartwarming and gorgeous.A Brilliant read."}, {"userName": "Lisarenee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2038272-lisarenee", "userReview": "Shannon is a former New Orleans socialite.

While she\u2019s eating, the guy with the piercing blue eyes sitting all alone in the booth at the far end of the restaurant catches her attention. He leaves while Shannon is asking Irene, the waitress/owner, about the help wanted sign. She gets the job and starts the next day. Seth Proudfoot, half white, half Native American, is a looker. He married his childhood sweetheart. Sadly, he lost his wife and son in a horrible car accident. Some of the town folk think Seth had something to do with the accident because he was behind the wheel yet he survived. This has caused him to retreat and become a loner. He quit working at the hospital but does some work out at the Reservation. He\u2019s also a woodworker and sells furniture to pay the bills. He comes into the Last Resort Cafe everyday for breakfast, lunch and dinner.On her first day on the job, Shannon gets a break after the morning rush and drives around town to familiarize herself with the place. She sees a log cabin and a breathtaking scenic view and decides to pull over to sketch it. Turns out it\u2019s Seth\u2019s place. He startles her and she makes a run for it. Not realizing that it\u2019s Shannon under the jacket and hood, Seth tackles her to the ground. She knees him in the crotch and Seth finally sees that it\u2019s her. He apologizes and invites her in for a cup of coffee.From that point, their relationship just takes off like a rocket. It was instant attraction for both Shannon and Seth. I enjoyed reading Shannon and Seth\u2019s relationship blossom but it seemed to progress rather quickly. In fact, I was quite surprised with how fast her relationship with Seth progressed and how trusting Shannon was with given that she had just met him. She came from a tormented past, being sold into a marriage at just 16 years old and staying in that abusive marriage for 10 years. She was abused, degraded and almost killed. I would have thought someone like that would be a bit more precarious when it comes to letting new people into their life. Her Sanctuary is told from third person narrative. There is one small part that is told from Joseph\u2019s POV and I found this not only awkward but unnecessary. I also felt that the captivity scene dragged out a bit too long. (Joseph is Seth\u2019s best friend from childhood, though they haven\u2019t been close since the accident that killed Seth\u2019s wife and son.) For the most part, I enjoyed reading Her Sanctuary. It was a quick read about second chances, at love and at life. The suspense held my interest and the love scenes were hot and steamy. And there were lots of them! I also liked the author\u2019s added touch of wolf folklore tied in at the end."}, {"userName": "CorLostForWords", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/365538-corlostforwords", "userReview": "I'll admit I was unprepared for the amount of sexual gratification there is in this novel. If you are a fan of lots of smut, then this is the book for you. If not, I'd highly advise not picking it up. The story opens with Shannon rolling into a little town called Sanctuary, and as she is inquiring about work in a small diner, she happens to see Seth and sparks fly. They both are attracted to each other and quickly develop a relationship. I was surprised at how quickly they consummated their relationship, especially considering both of their past histories. Shannon had been in an extremely volatile and abusive relationship that lasted for 10 years; and Seth had lost his family in a tragic accident. It was touching though, to see that they wouldn't let their respective pasts affect their futures.I enjoyed the storyline, but thought it was bogged down almost too much with the steamy scenes. It seemed to stall for a bit, but then it picked up and the mystery came into play. I also thought that I was accident prone, but Shannon has me beat. She manages to nearly kill herself several times--accidentally of course!The book was quite engaging, and it was a relatively quick read. I enjoyed the mystery in the story and thought it could have been explored more. I loved Millie's character, and wish that we could have learned more about her.I found the narrative jumped around a lot though, and in several paragraphs, it would jump several times between Seth and Shannon. Once you got to know the characters it was easier to tell who was narrating as their voices were distinctive.All in all, the book was good, though I wished it could have been fleshed out more in certain areas.

A young girl come to a bar and ask for a job as a waitress and then she meets her true love. Seth. Both have a bad history, but their love is stronger.

You get some informations about Shannons past.And then there is the enemy: Joseph. He is a good friend from Seth and a madman who want to abuse Shannon. And he kidnapp her.Well, there is a lot of tension, action and erotic in this book and it was very good to read because of the good writing style by the author. I was very pleased about this book, but sometimes the informations are repeated to often. You can follow the author very easy in the world of Shannon and Seth. The charactere are very strong and good. So there is Shannon and Seth, the main character, Joseph and Millie and the nice couple Irene and Paddy, the owner of the bar.

I felt like the story idea was a good concept but all things considered, it was too rushed. There was too much tragedy packed into one book, in my opinion. Especially within the first one hundred pages. It felt like the lead female character would know sooner get over one event in her life and be hit with another. Surely one person can not have that much bad luck? With that said, I liked the ending a little better than the beginning but it was a struggle to get to that point.

The characters were likable enough, but for two people that had so much past hurt, it seemed unlikely they would let it all disappear so quickly. Things moved too quickly to be believable for me. I enjoyed their love story, but time needed to be dragged out a bit. Also, Seth was discribed as a large Indian with a temper, however throughout the story he seemed like a softy. He started out calling Shannon \"Baby\" which is consistent with his original decription and then quickly began saying \"my love\", \"Love\" etc... Shannon was too perfect! After being in an abusive relationship, alone for years and suddenly finding herself in love with a loner of a guy, she's the town hero, open to everyone and has no problem trusting people she just met with the story of her past (which she has hidden unlocked in her RV).

I like the beginning part of the book. In the middle of the book it started to get a little slow and sometime I\u2019d catch myself day dreaming about what I am going to read next. WHAT\u2019S WRONG ABOUT ROMANCE AUTHORSThe woman in the book was a little traumatized because of what happened to her in her past. Witch I could understand. The thing I don\u2019t like about authors is that they make male characters so perfect that it sounds fake. Male in romance novels have fun personalities they are very rich, they have a great job, and most of all some have fantastic families. Although, I kind of like the idea of the perfect man but let\u2019s face it people men, or shall I say humans are not perfect? It doesn\u2019t matter how you were raised you can\u2019t possibly be perfect. This is where authors make that mistake. The only perfect person that ever walked this earth was Jesus Christ who was perfect because he was the son of GOD. It is always the women who are the crazy/ angry/traumatized girl who was done wrong by someone, never the man with issues. I know this is a book, and it\u2019s not real life, but if you\u2019re going to right the book that is not fantasy, I thing I\u2019d like to see something REAL. I don\u2019t think it is a very good idea when authors make things so easy in books, meaning that they create this character with problems like, family issues, abandonment issues, self-esteem issues and create a male character who is so perfect that they\u2019re going to come with their money and very good looks and sweep them off their feet, and make girls with problems better again. It doesn\u2019t matter how perfect the guy is, there looks or money can\u2019t buy happiness, and help them with issues that might need professional help. Sorry people, that doesn\u2019t happen. I understand that women have issues just like men have issues, but authors need to find a different way to solve the characters problems, other than love, lust and sex. These books make young women think that men will come by and fix their problems which is a very wrong move. Now I\u2019m not saying that teens might copy what they read in a book, only that some teens might think that, that\u2019s the way real life is, when at the end, life isn\u2019t that way. This is how this book plays out, a perfect person who helps a woman who needs help, by using sex, and sex and more sex to solve her childhood troma. I understand that this character in the book might want to help this girl by the name of Shannon, but he doesn\u2019t take her to see a shrink, only sleeps with her, showers her with gifts, and tells her what she wants to hear, which bothers me. This book has many sexual parts more than anything else. Literally every other page had a sex scene; they were doing it outside on the hood of the car, and even on the parking lot. THE MOST DISTURBING ABOUT THIS BOOKThe most disturbing part of the book was that the main character Shannon Mallory was kidnapped and was taken from her boyfriend\u2019s home. She was locked up in some cabin deep inside miles and miles of woods. Her kidnapper was name Joseph. This man stalked her for weeks since she arrived at the small town until the day of her kidnapping. She was taken to some room, and at some point she was grabbed, hit almost raped and other things were done to her. When she was finally found and rescued by her boyfriend and taken out of her hell. The bad disturbing part was that her and her boyfriend who is named Seth stayed at the stalkers cabin. The kidnapper/stalker was tied up to a bed in another room and the couple Seth and Shannon decided to stay at the cabin. The worst thing about this was that they had sex hours after her rescue. Now most women would be scared of men, they have to see a shrink and wouldn\u2019t think about having sex for months, especially in the stalkers cabin and in the stalkers bed. The couples have sex on the kitchen table and even outside the stalkers yard. Tell me that\u2019s not disturbing. They do not GO HOME they stay at the stalkers cabin for months. That\u2019s right people months. The police don\u2019t come to rescue them they just let the man by the name of Seth live in that home for months. They even leave the stalker in the room tied up for months At the end I give this a one star. Simply because I didn\u2019t find anything interesting at all. The characters were weird. The story idea was ok, but everything else was just plain odd. I hope this author improves. At this time I will not read another of her books until she improves her way of writing. I mean no disrespect to the author, this is just my opinion. I do believe that if you are going to be an author, you have to be willing to see what people write in ur reviews, that\u2019s the only way of improving the way you write. I find that these reviews are a way of helping an author. If I were an author I\u2019d like to hear about my books weather it is the good the bad and the ugly."}, {"userName": "DeadGirl Drama", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3697219-deadgirl-drama", "userReview": "\u201cA Solid Romance, but Light on Substance\u201dThe Plot: This book is about Shannon, a troubled young woman trying to escape her past in the remote town of Sanctuary. Shannon was sold into an arranged marriage at 16 where she was expected to be a sex slave to her wealthy, evil husband. After 10 years of slavery, Shannon kills her dominating husband in self-defense and is left with emotional scars that could rival any. Enter Seth. Seth is part Native American and grew up an outcast from his tribe. Despite this, he found love and happiness with his full-blooded wife Naome and their child, until a freak accident leaves his family dead and him up on trial for their deaths. Seth\u2019s life quickly spirals into ruin. That is, until a mysterious woman with turquoise eyes appears in Sanctuary with a troubled past and nothing to lose\u2026Zelda\u2019s Take: I thought that this book was a good summer romance read, but was lacking in the substance to make it truly believable for me. The attraction between Shannon and Seth is sweet and endearing and the sex is hot, but the reader never really gets why they fall for each other so fast. Sure, there\u2019s no question that they are physically attracted to each other, but that seems to be pretty much all they ever have. In fact, Shannon and Seth know virtually nothing about each other\u2026 and don\u2019t really ask questions to fill in the blanks either. It seems that, for them, physical attraction is all that matters, which I just found really difficult to believe. A relationship needs substance to last (at least happily), and at the rate Shannon and Seth are going, they\u2019ll be going their own separate ways in no time\u2026 with marriage and child or not. In addition to this, there were also a few little details in this book that just bugged me and really stood between me loving it and just liking it.First, there was Shannon\u2019s \u201cdumb girl\u201d syndrome. If there\u2019s one thing that turns me off about a lot of romance novels, it is women who do stupid things or play the helpless innocent. Shannon does some stupid things \u2014 like driving while being extremely drunk, mixing pills and alcohol, etc., while outwardly saying and understanding that they are not the smartest things for her to do. Why? If it helped to pull along the plot of her being emotionally scarred and this was her way of escaping, then I would let it slide, but instead it is just kind of gratuitous and passed off with a flippant \u201coh well, aren\u2019t I a bad girl?\u201d attitude. Second, was Seth\u2019s attitude towards sex. He acts like a child who can\u2019t control himself. So much so that he has to take steps to remove himself from certain situations because he can\u2019t keep his hands off of Shannon. Now, if this were a paranormal romance involving some otherworldly geis that forces their attraction or irresistible vampire bloodlust, that would be one thing, but as it is, Seth and Shannon are just two normal people and his inability to control himself just screams immaturity to me. I mean, really. Grow up.Third, is how the bad guys are portrayed in the novel. Both Shannon\u2019s ex-husband and Seth\u2019s ex-best friend, the novel\u2019s two evil-doers, are characterized by their BDSM tendencies, as if, well, they are into BDSM, so that is why they are evil. But I think that what gets me here is the characterization of BDSM being associated with evil, which just seems to propogate the false mindset that there is an inherent link between sexual kink and bad people. Shannon\u2019s ex-husband used to beat her and treat her as his sexual slave. Joseph kidnaps women and chains them up. All of the evil things that are done fall back to tenants of the BDSM world with one, giant, looming exception\u2026 consent. Why can\u2019t they just be characterized as the sexual perverts that they are? By linking them with dungeons and the like, the book seems to want to be making a statement that people who are into BDSM are bad. (And, of course, men who can\u2019t keep their hands off of women are perfectly normal. ;) )I guess, in the end, one would ask, what did I actually like about the book? I did finish reading it, after all. The answer is that I thought it was interesting. The characters have interesting backgrounds and lives. They have experiences that are unique to me and the main characters, Shannon and Seth, are likeable and fun. Which is why I call it a good summer read. It\u2019s fun, suspenseful, and the sex is good\u2026 what more does one need while sipping lemonade at the beach?!?"}, {"userName": "Greenfairylv", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2689566-greenfairylv", "userReview": "The chemistry between the main character Seth and Shannon was HOT, HOT, HOT. Sexy Indian? Check. Sexy shower scenes? Check. Intense romance? Check. This book had all of those. These two are always at each other, in the sense, if they were pieces of candy they\u2019d eat each other alive. I really don\u2019t think they could ever, in a lifetime, get enough of one another. Seth has a beautiful mane, mysterious eyes, rock hard tanned body. Shannon is beautiful with eyes you could swim in. If you could rely on Seth to do one thing, that would be to scoop Shannon up. He was always carry her and sweeping her off her feet. There is no doubt the author was able to betray how crazy these two where for each other. She made me blush a time or two.I had a problem with how fast Shannon fell for Seth. She was in a previous marriage where her husband was abusive. Her parents basically sold her when she was sixteen to be a sex slave. So, with all this abuse she once endured I figured she\u2019d be more reserved instead of basically meeting Seth one day, and what seemed like a week later, planning their wedding. I also didn\u2019t understand how Shannon was so quick consider Irene and Paddy family. With all the abuse I figured Shannon would be a little more guarded towards people and especially towards men.One of the main problems I had with the book is it was full of errors, the story was a little choppy and the switching between pov\u2019s was confusing. It was more in the shape of arc, not a polished book. That would be fine, but I paid $18 for a soft cover book. The book needed editing desperately I thought.There where points where Seth\u2019s temper made me think Shannon was crazy for being with him. The time frames some of the events happened where just so unbelievable. I was under the impression this was a small town. How did Seth practically build a whole downstairs apartment, with huge wall length windows, having time to pick out ever little detail like Shannon\u2019s art smock, within the short time she was in the hospital.? I had to just make myself stop questioning so much and just sit back and enjoy the story. Once I stopped trying to rationalize it was quite an enjoyable read. I believe the book is self published, and for that, I\u2019m glad I purchased the book.I also noticed the epilogue was written more smoothly. The flow was much better. And I thought the ending was great. I was left with wishing there were more chapters to come. The author is very good at portraying the intense love scenes. I will definitely read one of her books again and wish her much success."}, {"userName": "Lover of Romance", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3709091-lover-of-romance", "userReview": "Her Sanctuary starts out with a young woman \"Shannon\" who has definitely had some struggles in her young life. Living in a motor home, she comes to a town and arrives at a diner called the \"Last Resort Cafe\" where she finds a job, a sweet old couple that are angels, and a enigmatic man whose eyes entrance her. There is something deep hidden beneath those eyes and Shannon definitely wants to discover what it is. She is drawn toward him like she has never been drawn to another being in her life. Seth Proudfoot, a half breed native american, has been rejected by most around him. He has never felt at home, especially since he lost his beloved wife and child. But when he meets Shannon who is a breath of fresh air into his life, he can't resist her in any shape or form. As they are drawn together by certain circumstances, they find themselves finding a true love that neither of them expected to find, this is a romantic story that will warm you heart.When P.Q. Glisson requested that I read and review this book, I was delighted!! I had heard such great things about Her Sanctuary and felt honored to do a review of it. From the first page, I was completely drawn in, and it being a E-book, I could only read it when I was at home, which lately hasn't been much and took me a lot longer reading it that I would have liked. But it was definitely worth it, I absolutely loved this book. I don't usually read contemporaries but this one definitely is one of my favorite contemp romances that I have had the privelage of reading, and I have read some good ones. This was filled with romance, delightful characters, and a plot that just had me on the edge of my seat. Its filled with a tender love story but also with a hidden mystery and danger that I just fell in love with. I loved both of the characters, Shannon is a strong, independent woman that has suffered alot, and never wondering if she will ever find love or a family of her own. She is very surprised when she finds Seth, and the wonderous pleasures and delights that she finds in his arms and in his heart. Seth having greatly mourned the loss of his wife and child, doesn't want to lose Shannon as well. I definitely warmed up to this story very fast, and I am so glad that I was able to read it. I have very few complaints about this book, I found toward the end that the pace slowed down a bit, but other than that, Her Sanctuary is a PURE DELIGHT!!!!"}, {"userName": "Heather in FL", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2651785-heather-in-fl", "userReview": "I'm going to agree with what several others have said about this book already. While I enjoyed the overall story, I had trouble with Shannon falling for Seth so quickly based on her history, but I suppose it was necessary to understand how much she meant to him when she was kidnapped and vice versa. And while I love good sex scenes in my stories, it tended to get to be too much, especially at the end. They had Joseph restrained (temporarily) and I think there were two or three more times they messed around before he got loose. And nothing really happened in between... it just felt like it went from sex scene to sex scene to sex scene. I think even in the beginning it was a bit much, however I think that's likely how soulmates would behave when they've first met. But him picking her up every time he wanted to mess around with her got a bit old, too. At first it was sweet, but he was constantly carrying her around.Aside from the story, I also had trouble with the editing, as another reviewer mentioned. Word choice (i.e. heal instead of heel when speaking of a stiletto), misspellings (baulk is not a word, but balk is), funky punctuation (missing quotes, so you don't know for a few words that someone started/stopped speaking), the mixing of dialogue from different people within the same paragraph... It detracts from the story if I have to think about what I'm reading... to make sense of it. One other thing I had a problem with was the shifting point of view. Sometimes it shifted within the same paragraph, so it was confusing trying to figure out who was doing/thinking what. There was a point where Irene and Shannon were talking and the point of view shifted, but you weren't certain because either one could be \"she\".So, for a first book, I'd say it's pretty good. It's a nice story with a good HEA, which I always love. I'm not mad that I bought and read it. :-)"}, {"userName": "N.L.

The main characters were like bunny rabbits in heat. It is amazing they even came up for air for anything.I could have done with a little less sex, it became rather tedious to read after awhile.The pacing of this story was really odd. It went really quickly for awhile, slowed down to a crawl then preceded to alternate between quick and slow until the end.I did not find the relationship between the main characters to be believable because it happened too quickly to make any sense to the reader.I found a lot typos and grammar issues in the book too which often hindered the reading process. Frequently, dialogue bleeds into one another so the reader cannot distinguish - easily - who is saying what line. Some bits of dialogue are without punctuation so they get lost among the rest of the text. I had to re-read several sections just to make sure I was correct in my assumptions of speaker and dialogue.I want to get lost in a story and having to go back to re-read sections because they lack proper dialogue structure is immensely irritating.
