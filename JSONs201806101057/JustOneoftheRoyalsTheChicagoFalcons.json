His best friend Madison is also the girl of his dreams, but he needs to find the courage to tell her. Daniel is also hiding another truth. He's secretly a prince and his responsibilities are about to catch up with him. His step-sister has come to take him home and to try to convince him to take his place. The Falcons are taking a road trip but don't worry there will always be hockey!Madison is in love with her best friend but he has a different girl on his arm every weekend. She wants to follow her dreams to be an actress but her parents want her to be a doctor. When Daniel blows her off she finds herself in the local diner drowning her sorrows. The right place at the right time is about to earn Madison the inside scoop. The Chicago Falcons series is great. The writing style is catchy and the stories are juicy. Just One of the Boys is my favourite so far, but Just One of the Royals is good. I can't wait for more! Cheers for the underdog. This book has the perfect ending and a sneak peek at the next instalment. I just have two little niggles with this book. I hate the word bastard which I know is made popular by a certain snow but I wish it was phrased differently. My second dislike to this book is Daniels sisters nickname for him. I just found it a little irritating. These two things don't really affect the storyline. This can be read as a standalone, however, features the character from the first book. The story is enhanced with the background information on the other characters but not essential. One of the Royals is a fun read intended for the older teen. 4 Stars out of 5.*I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32020643-elaine", "userReview": "This is a lovely teen romance with plenty of surprises along the way. To start with Daniel Sacachelli is the illegitimate son - and heir -of the King of Eldonia but no one at his school knows this. There he\u2019s one of the star hockey players and best friend of Madison Myong. Actually he\u2019d like to be much more than her best friend, but she has very controlling parents and he has a poor reputation so they\u2019d find him totally unacceptable. Little does he know that Madison also wants to be more than his best friend but doesn\u2019t feel able to take the next steps to change that. Well, that was true until she overheard that he needs to save the throne for his family, so he needs help to make himself fit to be King. Now that\u2019s something Madison can do - she\u2019s a talented actor and has helped others take on different roles convincingly in the past. So now, the two are off to Eldonia, posing as a couple. Will they manage to fool everyone? Can she really help prove him worthy of becoming King? Will fake become real?This is a fun, light-hearted and entertaining read, with plenty of laugh out loud moments, some farcical aspects and great friendships and team spirit to help everything work out in the end. A quirky, quick and enjoyable read, just don\u2019t take it too seriously! I hadn\u2019t read the other book in this series but will be endeavouring to do so in future.I requested and was given a copy of this novel, via NetGalley, with no obligation.

I was also excited to see she was getting paired up with the resident bad boy, Daniel. They had a really close friendship in the previous book, but I wasn't sure if the attraction went both ways. The doubt each experienced made me a little nutty, but I did enjoy seeing their friendship evolve, and they ended up being great together.I was pretty surprised by the royal storyline, but I have to admit, I loved it! I read this book the day of the the royal wedding, so I was already sort of swept up in royal-mania. This just added to the fun. We got to travel to the small, European country of Eldonia, where we attended many events and saw Daniel try to live up to his princely title. Like many \"suddenly royal\" type stories, Daniel committeed many faux pas, but he also worked really hard to redeem himself, because in the end, it was all for his family.The family theme was quite strong in this book, and I always like when there is a solid family focus. The interactions between Daniel and his sister were very merry and heartwarming, and we also got to spend a lot of time with Daniel's Falcon family. Bromances can be a most splendid thing, and that was totally the case in Just One of the Royals.Just One of the Royals also really delivered on what I want in companion novels. Not only did we get to catch up with Al and Hayden, they were featured in this book. It's not the first time, and it won't be the last, that you hear me say how glad I was to see what happened \"after\". AND, I think the next match will result in lots of fun. The heroine is sassy, while the hero is a little on the shyer side. I know I am excited to see how that one works out.Overall: It was a lot of fun being back with the Falcons! The Roopers gave us another super cute romance with a fun royal twist.* ARC received in exchange for an honest review.

It does not impact my review. Just One of the Royals is the second book in a series about members of a junior hockey team. I haven\u2019t read the first book in the series yet (from what I gather it sounds very similar to the move She\u2019s the Man, but with hockey instead of soccer), but found this could be read easily as a standalone.I really liked the friendships in the book. The guys on the hockey team, plus Madison (the trainer) were all pretty close and they looked out for each other. I liked that there weren\u2019t any frenemies or mean girls. I also enjoyed Daniel\u2019s relationship with his half-sister and with his mother. He was super sweet with both of them and I loved it.The fake-relationship trope is one of my favorites and was the main reason for me wanting to read this book. However, I didn\u2019t really think that aspect of the book was very well done. The reason for them trying to fake a relationship was pretty flimsy to start with and then there were none of the fun moments where they had to try to prove to people they were together. They just like held hands a couple times? Kissed for the cameras once. No one in Eldonia really cared about their \u201crelationship\u201d at all and it just didn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me. It felt a lot more like Friends-To-More than Fake Relationship.Overall, Just One of the Royals, was a cute read and I liked that it was written by two sisters, but it\u2019s probably not a book I would want to pick up again. I liked Daniel and how all the relationships were portrayed, but was disappointed in the lack of Fake Relationship drama and also that I didn\u2019t find Madison to be very likable. If you enjoy sports romances and are trying to feed your Royal Wedding hangover, you might enjoy this one.Overall Rating (out of 5): 3 Stars"}, {"userName": "Colleen", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7531746-colleen", "userReview": "I received Just one of the Royals by Leah and Kate Rooper from Netgalley. It has no impact on my thoughts. My thoughts are my own. I was very excited when I first heard about Just One of the Royals. It's very surprising, but I love a good hockey story. And if you add in some royalty to it? HUGE BONUS!! I quickly started it when I got it and was very pleased that it met my expectations. Just One of the Royals is the second book to The Chicago Falcon's series by Leah and Kate Rooper. They could almost be read as a standalone, but the characters from the first book are mentioned several different times, so it would make sense to go back and read Just one of the Guys first before you pick this one up so you can fully appreciate all of the mentions/moments between the other characters. They didn't take up the whole story or anything, but it'd still just be appreciated more. The story also kind of mentions one plot that happened in the previous book and continues on from there for the two new characters.I loved the two new characters we had, Madison and Daniel. Madison was an aspiring actress, and Daniel was one of the players on the Chicago Falcon team. Madison was also the assistant trainer for the team. Daniel had a secret, and when his sister Eva comes to visit him, his secret is out...he's a prince. This part was totally a Princess Diaries moment but for a prince instead, but I still absolutely loved it. His sister had to bring him home, but not before convincing his best friend Madison to help him become the king of their kingdom. Madison's plan to help him was to become his pretend girlfriend to help Daniel win his kingdom over for him. This book was funny, there were a couple of different parts that had me laughing like when Daniel was panicking over his spaghetti and stuff like that. If you are looking for a book that is similar to The Princess Diaries, look no further. Just One of the Royals is just as witty with it, but there's just hockey and some smack talk added into it. It was an enjoyable fast paced five star read. Thank you Netgalley and publishers for giving me the chance to read this book! I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait for the next one already. I might even have to go back to reread the first one now."}, {"userName": "Alja Katuin", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43323743-alja-katuin", "userReview": "A lovely,light story about true love and how sometimes it\u2019s better to be honest and upfront!

Daniel has no interest in being the prince of Eldonia, let alone the king. However, after his father passes away, his sister comes out to America to ask for him to consider taking the thrown. In their country, only a male can rule the country, so if Daniel turns it down, Eva must marry a suitable man to rule the kingdom or the family will lose the thrown forever. This was sort of like Princess Diaries, only with hockey players.Daniel has always known he's a prince, and has spent his summers visiting his father. However, he never felt like Eldonia was his country or that he belonged there. So, when his sister drops the bombshell on his lap, he immediately panics. All he wants to do is play hockey and be a normal teen. Not to mention the fact that he knows nothing about Eldonia and is definitely not fit to be the countries ruler. Yet, he can't help himself from wanting to help out his sister. He was a really loyal character that would sacrifice anything for those he loved.The book is split up between Daniel's POV and Madison. While I really liked Daniel's character, I did not care for Madison at all. I'm not overly sure if she was all there. I'm think the girl may have had a few screws loose. I get it, she wants to be an actress, but this girl took it way too far. When she eavesdrops on Daniel's conversation with his sister, she decides the solution is to to Eldonia, pretend to be his long-lasting girl friend to prove that he's reliable, and show his people that he can be the future king of their country. Just about every thought from this girl was her playing out a scene, getting in character, viewing rooms as her stage, and it was a bit weird. Not to mention the crazed fit she has in the castle where she tears down a curtain and wrestles with it as she thinks how she doesn't want this stage any more and that it was time for the curtain to go down. No, honey. I am pretty sure it's time for you to see a doctor.While this was a cute story about Daniel coming into his Prince-hood, I never fully latched onto the story. I wasn't onboard with their romance, I didn't really care for Madison, and I just didn't feel like there was anything that really set it apart from other young adult novels."}, {"userName": "Thamy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3555338-thamy", "userReview": "I guess I hoped for another version of the secret-prince trope, but this one wasn't bad.Daniel is secretly a prince and now his father, the king of Eldonia, died, his sister shows up asking him to take over the throne or else she'll have to marry against her will thanks to some very old law. But Daniel knows his popularity isn't that high, so he gets the help of his secret-crush Madison, who suggests pretending they're a thing so he can show commitment.I really wanted the actual prince trope. I mean, Daniel is really a prince, but he wasn't raised like one, he's almost his father's dirty secret and never thought of going anywhere near the throne until his sister contacts him. I think most of my disappointment came from the simple fact it wasn't the story I wanted, so take that in consideration.Still... I caught myself a little bored. The pretend-relationship part never gave many fruits either, just the steps we all know the characters will end up taking. And to be honest, I wasn't convinced by the party-boy tag they put on Daniel. This is part of a series and I haven't read the first book, so mea culpa, but from this book alone, it was far-fetched. He seems too serious and focused for that here. Now the characters themselves were good. I loved Madison, Eva, and Daniel isn't bad at all, poor thing. Everything happening at the wrong timing... I could see the writers' talents for building characters and wouldn't stop thinking of how I want to read the rest of the series or the previous book. But the story itself lacked shine.If you're up for a nice, quick-to-read YA book, this can be it. But that's as far as it goes, in my opinion. Honest review based on an ARC provided by Netgalley.

This book was a quick, lovely, and entertaining friends to lovers story with plenty of sweet, heartwarming and laugh out loud moments. It was enjoyable from beginning to end and I cannot wait to read the other books in the series. Just One of the Royals by Leah and Kate Rooper is pretty much Princess Diaries, but instead of an awkward and shy teenage girl turned princess, we have an adorable and charming star hockey player who\u2019s secretly a prince, but wants nothing to do with being a royal\u2026let alone be the king of Eldonia. Daniel just wants to be a normal teenager and maybe finally find the courage to tell his best friend, Madison, that he wants more than just friendship. But, when his half-sister, Eva, comes to Chicago to convince him to claim his birthright as king, Daniel must make some tough decisions that will change his life forever. I read this book in less than 24 hours and was pleasantly entertained the entire time. I love friends-to-lovers stories and the prince/royalty trope made the plot even more interesting for me. The writing was easy to read and engaging. The characters were quirky and really intruiging. I thought the friendships and familial relationships were endearing. Madison and Alice were definitely friendship goals and I loved how they were always there for each other. I also loved the bond between Daniel and Eva. Even if they were millions miles apart, they were still very close and would do anything to make each other happy. The guys on the hockey team were pretty great too and I loved their team spirit. I wasn't too keen on the romance and didn't totally swoon over Daniel and Madison, but the romance was still cute and sweet. I thought the ending was heartwarming and the sneak peek for this next book definitely got me excited. With a fun and lighthearted storyline, amazing relationships, great team spirit, charming characters, and cute romance, Just One of the Royals will have you smiling the entire time. It\u2019s sweet, funny, and will teach you a thing or two about honesty and doing what truly makes you happy. If you enjoy romance and friends to lovers trope, then this cute contemporary with a royally adorable twist might just be perfect read for you!

All thoughts and opinions are my own. **This book was super cute! It immediately reminded me of The Prince and Me or even The Princess Diaries and even though contemporary romance isn't my usual read I knew that I had to give this one a try - and I'm glad that I did; I enjoyed it.Just One Of The Royals is actually the second in a series that seems to be centred around the budding romances of a team of hockey players however you can easily read this as a standalone (I did!). The couple from the previous book did feature in this one however everything you needed to know was explained/recapped and I didn't feel as though I was missing anything although I might search out the first book just to see!Daniel is our main character, a hockey player and a bit of a reprobate, he's harbouring a huge secret - the fact that he's actually the prince of a foreign country. Madison is Daniel's best friend, a Korean-American whose parents are doctors and would like her to follow in their footsteps but Madison aspires to be an actress.The writing style is simple and easy to read but sometimes the interactions felt a little awkward and contrived. I actually found it easier to connect with Daniel over Madison and I found his character believable and his motivations genuine. This isn't an unpredictable story and at times I was wanting to jump into the pages to give the characters their solution (which they came to eventually by themselves) but considering we're following a group of teenagers nothing felt out of place. It's light and fluffy and entertaining and with the ice-hockey and royalty angle I can see it being popular with many readers. The next book centres on Daniel's half sister which also sounds like it could be extremely sweet and cute so I'll be following this series."}, {"userName": "Miranda (MrsLeif's Two Fangs About It)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15295977-miranda-mrsleif-s-two-fangs-about-it", "userReview": "Just One of the Royals was a fun and cute book to read during my royal wedding hangover!

The authors were great at creating believable and fun friendships between everyone. The romance in this book was very sweet and adorable! The romance was supposed to be the trope of a fake relationship to something more, which is one of my favorite tropes! However, the romance felt more like just friends to lovers. I didn't think the fake relationship idea was really developed all that much to make it seem realistic. The romance was still a lot of fun, but I just wish I would have seen a little more of that fake relationship trope throughout the story.Overall, this was a quick and enjoyable read!

The thing is, 15% into the book I knew how it would end. Like, I've pretty much read this plot line before in both YA and adult romance books, so all the steps were pretty obvious... unfortunately. Someone new to romance might not know these steps, though, so it might be a good read for them. But for Madison, our main character who claims to watch K-dramas, she totally should have seen the ending coming as well, so I don't even understand why she did what she did. I weirdly didn't even realize this was YA until I started it... I honestly thought they would be 18-22 years old... so, rearranging their ages in my head, did cause an issue. How is a 17 year old known in two countries for his ways with women and doing keggers?? Like, how is he drinking himself completely drunk and yet his mother doesn't care. It feels like this was supposed to be a NA book, but then things were changed or added in for drama and to make it YA. The thing is, I did really like the concept. I like lost princes or being forced to be King-- bringing modern touches to traditional places. I loved how Madison is Korean-American, bringing in a bit of a diverse mix, even if it isn't really brought up. The k-pop and k-drama mentions though, made me smile. Her stuff was a bit cliche.... parents wanting her to be a doctor and all. Look, when if comes down to it, this is a cute romance with a sports background; a romance I think guys and gals could like and the dual-perspective, I think is done pretty well.

Thank you to the Rooper sisters,\u00a0Entangled Teen, and Chapter by Chapter for my eARC of the book in exchange for an honest review. While I have not read the first book in the series, these books are actually just different stories about different people on this hockey team, so there isn't a ton of build up missing by jumping into the second book, and the reoccurring characters are reintroduced.This book felt very much like\u00a0The Princess Diaries vibes: Daniel is a prince who grew up living a normal life in Chicago. He needs to be whipped into shape and lose his bad image in order to take the throne of a small European country after the death of his father. The biggest difference is that he brings along his best friend and secret crush, Madison, to play the role of his girlfriend in order to improve his image. Boy, do things get messy there!Madison's goal in life is to be a big time movie star, so when she is offered the role of a lifetime, and the opportunity for her big break if she succeeds, there's no way she'd turn it down! Especially when it means more time with her best friend. But with so much acting going on by both Daniel and Madison, how is anyone supposed to tell what's real and genuine, and what's not? Are the people they strive to portray taking them away from the people they really are?Just like Mia Thermopolis, while learning about this country he is being asked to rule, Daniel learns about the people, the culture, and begins to love everything about it. He starts to take a genuine interest in the people around him, which is honestly one of the biggest character growth scenarios he goes through. It's no longer about what he wants when he wants it, but about how the people around him are affected.The playboy who gets serious about one girl trope seems to be super common in YA contemporary books lately. It didn't really feel necessary to this plot--there are plenty of other ways Daniel can be selfish and unfit for the throne. From this aspect, there doesn't seem to be much creative liberty and I was wishing for more depth to Daniel."}, {"userName": "Olivia Farr", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8488828-olivia-farr", "userReview": "\"Just One of the Royals\" was a cute but predictable YA romance. Daniel is passionate about hockey and plays for the Chicago Falcons, where his close friend Madison works as a trainer. Daniel is trying to work up the courage to ask her out, while Madison is working up the courage to ask her parents to go to Julliard. Madison dreams of being an actress, while her parents want her to go to medical school and become a doctor like them. Everything is about to change when Daniel's sister, Eva, comes to town to try to convince Daniel to take the throne of Eldonia. Daniel's father was the king, and he never married her mother, a commoner in the US- so Daniel feels like he's only known for being the illegitimate and troublesome son. However, since only a male can rule, if he doesn't step up to the plate, Eva will be forced into marriage at only 16, where she will have no power- her husband will be the ruler. Eva recruits Madison to help- and offers her an audition for a popular show if she can convince Daniel to become king and prevent her own unfortunate marriage. Madison proposes to help Daniel by posing as his long-term girlfriend and dispelling some of the party-boy image he has. The only problem is that both Madison and Daniel secretly want the fake relationship to be real.With misunderstandings, blunders, enemies, and hockey, this Crush book moves quickly (albeit predictably) to the inevitable conclusion. You'll have to check it out to learn more! Although this is second in a series, this one focuses on different characters in alternating first person points-of-view and you don't need to have read the first one to enjoy this one. However, if you did read the first book, those characters don't disappear and keep popping up with some cute scenes. This was a cute (and clean) romance; the only caution I would have is for underage drinking, but it's extremely minor.

The Chicago Falcons series is a young adult sports romance series, where each book follows a different hockey player and tells his story.In just one of the Royals we follow Daniel and Madison. Daniel and Madison are best friends, but one of them is hiding a pretty big secret- that he is actually a prince! I know the set up is a bit different, but this book gave me all kinds of great Princess Diaries vibes. I loved it. I also really liked the best friend romance aspect of the story. That is always going to be one of my favorite contemporary romance tropes. Not to mention there is tons of hockey fun...and hockey players. Basically, all of my favorite things in a light hearted young adult romance.Kate and Leah have a wonderfully conversational writing style, which leads to books that have a wonderful flow to them. I read both of the books in this series in one day. They are quick, reads that you can easily demolish in one sitting, and at the end you will have a nice big satisfied smile on your face. So whether you love hockey romances, best friends romances or secretly royal romances, this is the book for you. It has everything all in one! I really enjoyed Just one of the Royals. It was a cute and fun read.This review was originally posted on Book Briefs"}, {"userName": "Johanna Montilla", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36551004-johanna-montilla", "userReview": "\u201cLiving a lie so well, it consumed my truth.

This is about as fluffy as a book could get - this was a very quick read for ALL the wrong reasons. Madison secretly wants to be an actress while her parents expect her to become a doctor. Her best friend Daniel, is secretly a Prince for a country named Eldonia whose singular interest appears to be hockey. Things get dramatic when his sister Eva comes with a big problem.  Eva is set to marry this horrible guy she's uninterested in purely so someone can take the throne. You see, there's a rule that says women can't rise to the throne in Eldonia - which is why she must marry first. Thus, Daniel comes over with Madison to charm the people, win over the power, and become king before his sister gets hitched. Unknown to Daniel, Eva has agreed to get Madison this huge acting audition if she plays along as girlfriend.  There's nothing wrong with the story in theory here - it works just fine. The issue is that I have zero interest or care for these characters. There's nothing about them that's intriguing, different, or out of the ordinary. In fact, they're so bland - that Madison and Daniel don't even quite work as a couple. They lack any chemistry and so when they have issues later on, I found myself satisfied with that as a resolution. I was shocked that they attempted the whole \"legitimate couple\" twist considering how fakey this all felt."}, {"userName": "Raj Nandani", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62009173-raj-nandani", "userReview": "Being a prince is not easy, but being a bastard prince is much more difficult. Daniel may agree with this more than anyone. He is just the opposite of what a King is supposed to be yet he has this big load of being the new King of Eladonia. Either this or he will lose his kingdom and the happiness of his little half sister. He loves his family more than anything so he takes this challenge along with the encouragement of his friends and his crush, Madison.Madison is an actress at heart and yet her parents want her to pursue career in medical. She secretly loves Daniel, the star ice hockey player and bad reputed as a person. She wants him to be his boyfriend but stops thinking about his feelings. One day, she stumbles upon the truth that he is a Prince and now she is determined to help him get his throne.The blurb and the cover promised an interesting story and the story turned out not to be interesting but also fabulous, fantastic, and adorable. The romance factor along with the struggle to fit in and prove oneself, when mixed together gave us an amazing read.The fight for the throne has not overshadowed the romance and the romance hadn't curbed the feelings and bonding of friendships. The characters are fabulously created and their roles realistic. Never once this story felt to go overboard in order to justify the happenings. Thar big twist in the end with Era,,, it was just the perfect piece of the puzzle put together.If you like romance, short yet memorable reads with perfect flavor of friendship and love towards the family and friends then must read this book. It will not disappoint you.I want to thank Entangled Publications and Netgalley for the review copy. This is fully my hinest opinion on the book."}, {"userName": "Johanna Montilla", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36551004-johanna-montilla", "userReview": "\u201cLiving a lie so well, it consumed my truth.

Bad boy Daniel is best friends with straight laced Madison. Only thing is that Daniel like likes Madison but doesn't think the girl with doctor parents will go for the boy from the wrong side of the tracks. Unbeknownst to Daniel, Madison is crushing really hard on him also. When Madison finds out Daniel is a prince, she tries to help him change from his bad boy status to the king he is meant to be. This was a cute story. I thought it was sweet when Daniel was trying to tell Madison he wanted to be more than friends. I was like if she would just let him get a word in he can tell her how he feels. I liked Daniel. I thought he was a little hard on himself but knowing his relationship with his father, I see where his insecurities came from. I liked Madison even though I thought she was written kind of stereotypical. She was a sweet girl and very loyal to her friends. I liked this story but I wish there was more one on one time with Daniel and Madison. When they finally went to the country of his father, they had the couple from the first book with them and I think that took away from some of the one on one time with this book's couple. I really loved Daniel's relationship with his sister but that nickname she gave him was annoying. I think it only annoyed me because it;s close to my name...lol. I liked how the conflict in the story was resolved. I was satisfied with the resolution. Overall it was a sweet read."}, {"userName": "Thamy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3555338-thamy", "userReview": "I guess I hoped for another version of the secret-prince trope, but this one wasn't bad.Daniel is secretly a prince and now his father, the king of Eldonia, died, his sister shows up asking him to take over the throne or else she'll have to marry against her will thanks to some very old law. But Daniel knows his popularity isn't that high, so he gets the help of his secret-crush Madison, who suggests pretending they're a thing so he can show commitment.I really wanted the actual prince trope. I mean, Daniel is really a prince, but he wasn't raised like one, he's almost his father's dirty secret and never thought of going anywhere near the throne until his sister contacts him. I think most of my disappointment came from the simple fact it wasn't the story I wanted, so take that in consideration.Still... I caught myself a little bored. The pretend-relationship part never gave many fruits either, just the steps we all know the characters will end up taking. And to be honest, I wasn't convinced by the party-boy tag they put on Daniel. This is part of a series and I haven't read the first book, so mea culpa, but from this book alone, it was far-fetched. He seems too serious and focused for that here.Now the characters themselves were good. I loved Madison, Eva, and Daniel isn't bad at all, poor thing. Everything happening at the wrong timing... I could see the writers' talents for building characters and wouldn't stop thinking of how I want to read the rest of the series or the previous book. But the story itself lacked shine.If you're up for a nice, quick-to-read YA book, this can be it. But that's as far as it goes, in my opinion.Honest review based on an ARC provided by Netgalley.

Come to find out this book was going to give me both! Madison and Daniel are both such fun characters who each have their own issues to deal with. They both are in love with each other, but don't think the other feels the same. Madison and Daniel have a lot of fun moments because of this. Being best friends doesn't mean you know all of each other's secrets. Madison finds this out the hard way when she hears that Daniel is actually a prince. I loved the story behind this and the fact that it was a prince this time and not a princess. Also, the authors wrote this book from both POVs and this doesn't happen often in YA. Not ones I have read anyways. I read this book in one sit and was sad that it was over. Daniel only has the summer to prove he is fit to be King and Madison will help him by pretending to be his girlfriend. We all know that this will somehow go wrong. Daniel has great friends and a family who wants to see him get where he needs to be. When I finished Just One of the Royals I had a smile on my face. It was very predictable at times, but sometimes that's just what we need. All I know is I need to get my hands on the first book soon and hopefully the third one when it comes out. I was hoping Eva was going to get a book and at the end we find out she will! That little sneak peek wasn't enough!"}, {"userName": "Kati", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52470643-kati", "userReview": "A sports romance, secret royalty, a fake-relationship... this book ticks all the boxes for me. \u00a0This book does not suffer from second book syndrome and instead takes some of the concepts built upon in the first book and expands upon it to gigantic proportions. This small hockey romance series just got a royal twist.\u00a0Madison is the protagonist in this novel and in book one she was the best friend. I loved her so much as the best friend and didn't think I could enjoy her character any more. I was wrong. As the protagonist I was already invested in Madison and it was so good to read about her romantic journey and all the mishaps on the way.\u00a0Daniel was the bad boy in the Falcons hockey team with a big secret no-one would have guessed. I hadn't formulated much of an opinion on Daniel from the first book, mostly because he only had little cameos. He is so much more than meets the eye and I really enjoyed delving into the depths of his life and his romantic journey with Madison.\u00a0Taking a complete 360 from the original book in this series. Just One Of The Royals takes a hockey romance and gives it a royal twist. If you love sports romance or royal reads or maybe even both this is a novel that warmed my heart.
