YOU NEED THEM!!), i loved this book. from the beginning, i knew i was going to love this book.it is purely awesome the whole way through.peak,the son of two once-famous, now separated mountain climbers, gets caught scaling a skyscraper in manhattan and tagging the very top of it. this is not the first one he has done, but the first one they catch him at. after a copycat dies in his own attempt, peak cuts a deal and gets shipped off to live with his dad in thailand, but dad has a little surprise. instead of going fishing, like normal safe people, he takes his son to tibet climb everest (with a secret agenda to make peak the youngest american ever to reach the top,also conveniently getting publicity for his climbing business)and the rest is all climbing. and danger. and friendship and personal growth and some really wonderfully touching scenes and a perfectly appropriate ending. i strongly recommend this book, to y/a and other audiences. this is both a great adventure book and a great coming-of-age novel.and now i see he has a book called sasquatch. this author is my new best friend."}, {"userName": "Shelby *trains flying monkeys*", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1053760-shelby-trains-flying-monkeys", "userReview": "Peak Marcello is fourteen years old and like most fourteen year old boys (that I have encountered) he is kinda dumb. He has been climbing skyscrapers in New York City because I guess he is bored. He gets busted after climbing one of them and is given a choice..go to Juvenile Detention or go live with his dad. Peak doesn't really have the typical type of parents..back in the day his mom and dad were known as rock rats..they would climb any mountain. Mom calmed down after she broke her back climbing and went on to settle down and have Peak a couple of sisters. But Dad? He now has started his own adventure expedition company. Guess what's up next on Dad's agenda?\nOh heck yes! I'm have weird fascinations with several things and that dang Mt. Everest is one of them. I'll read anything featuring that mountain or sit through any movie/documentary or whatever. Anyways...Dad surprises Peak with the fact that he is going to be the youngest to summit Everest. He doesn't really ask..it's more a tell situation.Peak has never had a close relationship with his dad due to the fact that he wasn't a mountain so their relationship has always been strained. Then when he gets to the mountain base camp thinking he is going to go with his dad he realizes that he is living in a dream world. His climbing companion is to be an old monk who used to be a Sherpa and a young boy.Now let's talk about how good this was. The author does an amaze balls job with how scary that damn mountain is. (Including that elusive 'death zone' where every minute you spend in it is your body dying.)\nHe even talks about the dead bodies on it. I expected a young adult book to gloss over those.\nI need to buy a copy of this one to make convince the boy child to read. It's got all the good stuff: No lurrrve story, great writing, quick paced and there is a real heartwarming part for the people that have feelings. And best of all???? Everest for the ones of us that are fascinated but no there is no way in hello that we'd ever do it.\nBooksource: Netgalley in exchange for review.

Everest and most importantly, his new found maturity and values as he braves frigid temperatures, a death-defying climb and the gritty side of human nature, as well as the best humanity has to offer. Welcome to the world of Peak, bundle up, grab some oxygen, and settle in for a breathtaking read for all ages!Born to climb, born to parents who lived for the thrill of the danger, the exhilaration and feeling of accomplishment in defying gravity, Peak was a natural. When a stunt in NYC lands him in the custody of his mountain climbing, absent father, he is caught between his own desire to make his mark in the world and his father\u2019s single-minded selfish desires to use his son as a marketing tool to stroke his own ego and fill his pockets.Enter the mind and thoughts of a teen who learns what is important in life as his eyes are opened to the world and the people around him. Roland Smith has given us adventure, danger and tells it with the youthful voice of young Peak. Magnetic, adventurous, young readers will feel the highs, the lows and the awe of this adventure as if they were there. An amazing journey filled with the heart of a young boy, the brutality of an ancient mountain and the narcissist egos of the adults around him who seem to forget there is no \u201cI\u201d in TEAM when lives are always ON THE LINE and there is no room for the phrase, \u201cEvery man for himself.\u201d Eye-opening, realistic, enough to fuel younger readers\u2019 minds with the power of reaching for the sky, while learning to stay well-grounded in life.

Unfortunately, his last illegal climb of a skyscraper hands him a harsh sentence from a Judge who is trying to make an example of him. Peak's father steps in and offers to finish raising the boy halfway around the world. His father gives Peak an opportunity to climb Mount Everest in order to be the youngest climber to top the mountain, but Peak soon realizes there are strings attached to the deal. I love this book because Peak realizes that there is more to life than just grazing skyscrapers and topping mountains. He learns a lesson that his father will never learn---that there is more to life than climbing mountains and One must set his sights on something higher in the end. Peak learns that he must find a healthy balance between his passion for climbing and other goals in life that build a young boy's character. Famous climbers have often said that \"Altitude is the great equalizer\" in one's life. Peak begins to wonder if his lack of selfishness and self-centeredness will ultimately costs him his claim to fame as the world's youngest climber to top Mount Everest.\"The only thing you'll find on the summit of Mount Everest is a divine view.

What kind of things happen while people are climbing and how long it takes to climb to get to your destination? Peak gives you all of the information about it. And including a story line to go with it, not just facts on climbing. Being the kind of reader I am (reading mysteries and crimes and such), this book is actually fascinating. It actually caught me onto some spots in the book where there was a twist and it got me more into it and wondering what will happen next. Peak, is a fourteen year old boy who loves to climb. Long story short, his dad left his mom for climbing while she took care of Peak. Anyway, Peak took the chances and climbed a building in New York. He got caught by the police and went to trial. It was either to go to a Juvenile Detention Center or have his mother bail him out. Peak has not seen his dad in seven years and Josh (Peak\u2019s dad) comes to trial to bail Peak out. He succeeded. The only reason why he bailed Peak out? Is so he can go climb Mount Everest and be the youngest person to reach the top. That means, they had to hurry before Peak\u2019s birthday, which was close.  I\u2019d have to say my least favorite character was Josh, because he\u2019s only been using Peak for fame. He left Peak\u2019s mom so he could climb, (she could not climb anymore because of breaking her back). My opinion on this book is that it was actually pretty amazing to read. There were great events in the story and points where I had fun reading it. One weakness is that it caught me off guard on some points, then it would redirect me and I figured out on what\u2019s been happening. I recommend this book to anyone who loves climbing and are into great twists in books. There was a twist that really got me and I kept my eyes locked on the book for a while. You can learn a lot about what climbers really do on the mountains and how they do it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a great book to read."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/291574-heather", "userReview": "Peak Marcello is a fourteen year old boy living in New York City who illegally climbs skyscrapers to satisfy his passion for climbing, handed down to him from both of his parents.

This is without a doubt one of the two best children's books about survival and adventure. The other is  Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. Seriously, I can't see any kid, especially boys, not devouring this book. Now that so much about Mt. Everest is on the internet, every kid who reads this is going to be searching the internet for pictures of dead bodies, trash, base camps, and the summit. It's just fascinating material. If you die on Mt. Everest you stay on Mt. Everest. This book is the kid version of  Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer.I'm not going to get into a synopsis, because trust me, you don't need it. You just need to start reading the book. But I will say that one of my favorite things about the book is that Peak's (the main character) mom tells him in a phone call while he's at Base Camp that you have to be selfish in order to make it to the summit, but when he is 10 yards from the summit he makes a move that is the exact opposite. Maybe that annoyed some readers and made them drop their rating, but for me it just made the book that much better. It's true that you can only think of yourself when disaster strikes or you'll be one of those dead bodies left behind. There is a story that Peak's dad tells that illustrates this point perfectly and it also explains why Peak made the decision he did at the Summit. Just read the book if you have any interest in adventure or if you are a librarian who needs a book that will be a sure thing for boys."}, {"userName": "Gabriella Nestor", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5548890-gabriella-nestor", "userReview": "IntroductionThe novel Peak is written by Roland Smith expressing the physical and emotional tolls on a fourteen year old boy Peak Marcello as he climbs to reach for Mount Everest. In the opening scene, Peak writes about his outrageous stunt in scaling the Woolworth building in New York City to tag his blue mountain on them. Nevertheless, his plans rapidly come to a complete end, as he is caught and arrested for vandalism, and climbing. His stunt goes public and Peak is in deep trouble and has to go into juvenile as he recently hears about a boy who dies trying to attempt his same exact stunt. Just in a nick of time, Peak is saved from going into juvenile detention as the judge agrees to let Peak to go live with his famous mountaineer father Josh Woods in Thailand. However, it all turns out that Peak\u2019s father has a special reason in saving his son; he wants Peak to be the youngest climber in scaling Everest in the efforts of publicity and money in saving his struggling company. Excited Peak is up for the challenge but soon learns again that his father would not be companying him, in the expense of his paying customers. Peak is sent off to his fathers head Sherpa for training and acclimation with a Nepalese boy his same age, name Sun-jo. At the same time, a media crew follows their every move at base camp in their effort to the summit. In addition, an over the top Chinese police captain diligently searches for passports violations and underage climbers. Peak and the others is very aware of the dangers in climbing Mount Everest and Base Camp, can cost them their lives. Peak\u2019s empathy for Sun-jo makes him make a huge decision as he near the summit, revealing his growth and maturity. This novel reminds me of another novel \u201cSomewhere In The Darkness\u201d where it discusses a boy name Jimmy who\u2019s lives with his maternal grandmother until his long- lost father shows up and takes him away in the efforts of running away from the law.Craft and StructureThe author Roland Smith writes the novel in first person point of view threw the identity of a fourteen- year- old boy Peak Marcello. Where Peak describes his challenges and emotions on his effort to reaching the Summit through writing in his journal for a assignment for his teacher. \"My name is Peak. Yeah, I know: weird name. But you don't get to pick your name or your parent\". The author also includes a few things about or used in climbing that some people would not quite get such a crampons which, are devices used to improve the climbers mobility in the ice and snow. I was able to figure out what they were because I know cramp is to hold on to. So I know that it could not have been gloves but shoes that have spikes to attach to the snow and ice. Another word that I thought would be tricky is the word crevasses , crevasses are these deep cracks in the glacier that have long vertical walls. I was able to figure out what crevasses mean because I saw a true documentary on it.ThemeI believe the theme of the novel was learning the deeper meaning of true friendship and the importance of family. Peak experiences both of these virtues at the end of the story and was able to grow and understand the meaning of a solid friendship that can last a lifetime. He didn\u2019t have to give up his only opportunity he was just 10feet away from being the youngest climber to reach the summit.\"Tomorrow's your birthday. You have a reason to be here, Sun-jo. An important reason. Your future and your sisters' future. I don't have a reason for being here. I'm heading back down the north side.\" Peak recognized how important it would be to let Sun-jo to reach the summit before his birthday had come. I believe also that he did it because he was sorry that Sun-jo father died in the process of saving his and appreciated Sun-jo fathers courage and willingness to do so. \"I didn't want to be the youngest person to summit Everest. Sun-jo's father died saving my father. Reaching the top would save Sun-jo and his sisters.\" Peak had his own responsibilities he had already help sun-jo to get to the top now he realized how important it would be to get down in order to be with his sister's and family. \"The only thing you'll find on the summit of Mount Everest is a divine view. The things that really matter lie far below\"CharacterizationThe author developed the main character, through indirect characterization. Peak Marcello is an amazing young guy both in his reasonable and unreasonable ways that he possess in the novel. He loves his family a lot but I also think that he sometimes feels lost and confused at the same time. He reveals his deep compassion for his mother, he is also very close with his stepfather Rolf who takes him as his own son, and his deep love for his half-sisters. Even through he has all the family love in the world Peak still feels incomplete he decides to attempt his void in negative ways he pushes his families limits by climbing the New York skyscraper to hook his blue tags, but eventually gets caught by the law. All of his plans are taken from him and is starting a whole new adventure without his family, has to live with his biological father.Through his travels he realize how much he miss his family and how closer he hasbecome with them. He also gets the chance to understand who he is and what he want to be in the future.ConclusionI would recommend the novel Peak to people that love adventure and action books, because it really get you at the edge of your seat to know what happens next. I would also recommend this novel to those who are not fond with reading, this book would be the best fit for you or anyone else that needs a book to entertain them. This book also has a lot of emotion especially at the end of the book which is my favorite part because it is something that each and every on of us can learn from. Learning how to appreciate what we have and making those willing decisions to those that don\u2019t ."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth O", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5548900-elizabeth-o", "userReview": "Introduction  The book that I had just finish reading is called \"Peak\" written by Roland Smith.This book is about a 14 year old boy named Peak who had illegally tried to climb up the skyscrapers and gets in trouble with the police.

The youngest person to ever get to the top of the mountain is a chinese person who's about 20 year old person. Because of this, they have all the power and if a young american person who's below the age of the youngest climber who had reached the top of Mount Everest, the chinese will lose the power. On page 78 it states,\" The youngest Americans to Everest are a couple of 20 years old,' he explained. ' So your being 15 might have worked, but truthfully getting a 14 year old up there has more sex appeal, especially after your climb in New York\".  Structure One important word that I that confused me a little is the word crampons. Crampons are boots that are used for climbing and their very sharp on the bottom. Another word that also confused me a lot was the word sherpa which is a member of a Himalayan people living on the borders of Nepal and tibet and they are renowned for their skill in mountaineering. This book is written in 1st person because the narrator is the person who is speaking to you and uses the words i,we,my,me and ect.  The theme of this book is that when you make a huge mistake, you have to serve the consequences and you can get isolated from the people who you most love and that can hurt them and it can also hurt you. It can also provoke anger that can cause people to say things that make other people think what they're not. On page 9, it states, \"I just talked with your mother. She said that I had her permission to beat you to death\". The reason why Peak's mother said this was because of her anger about error that Peak made. Also, Peak had to leave new york and the people who he most love to fly to thailand to live with his father.Therefore because of his mistake, he was away from his proponents for a long time.  Peak is a very courageous character. The reason is that he took the risk of climbing one of the most tallest building in New York. Also, he knew that he had a high possibility of getting arrested but still took the risk. Then, he was tenacious when he decided to climb Mount Everest which is even worst than climbing a tall building. So from the beginning to the end, Peak starts to become more tenacious and takes larger risks. In my opinion this is a very intresting book because since this book is written from a teenager, this book can give a lot messages to young adults about life and this can give other teenagers a lesson and make them learn from Peak's mistake. So, I would recommend this book to any teenager, high-schooler's, kids in middle school and children because by reading this book, it can give them a lesson about how life is. Since Peak had learn from his mistake, he becomes a different person and that changes his family and was welcomed when he came back from thailand."}, {"userName": "Peter Nicholson", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23866682-peter-nicholson", "userReview": "I did like this book \"Peak\" by Roland Smith, because of how it was written and the plot caught my attention very well. Although I didn't like that the events where happening very slowly, and it wasn't action packed. I enjoyed reading this book a lot and would definitely read it again. \"Peak\" was about a boy named Peak who loves to climb just like his parents did at his age. He lived in New York with his mom and stepdad, his real father is located on Mt.Everest climbing and running a business. Peak had no mountains to climb in New York so he worked with what he could. One day he was caught climbing a skyscraper and faced jail time. The only way Peak could not get the sentencing was to leave the state, so he went to go live with his dad all the way across the Atlantic Ocean. Peak lived on Everest and he got to climb the mountain with another boy who is also there, Sun-Jo. If they made it to the top before Peaks birthday he would have been the youngest to ever do the climb. They finally reached the top when Peak lets Sun-Jo go first and Peak goes back down the mountain even though he only had ten more feet to go. Peak did this so Sun-Jo could live legally with his mom on the other side of the mountain known and Nepal. Peak then returns home for his siblings birthday party as he wanted to.  Peak was the main character in the book and he was a very nice young man who can think for himself. He would help someone out even when it endangers himself. Josh is Peak's dad who works on Everest and Peak had not seen Josh in a very long time. Josh was a nice guy who loves to climb and runs a company for it. Josh was kind and caring but also will enforce the rules when they need to be enforced.  The setting for this book was on Mount Everest in the spring months. If the setting was different the book wouldn't exist because it takes a long time to climb Mount Everest. The book could have changed if something happened to the mountain such as the weather warming up and causing an avalanche. This was a very good book I liked it a lot and would definitely recommend this to one of my friends. I think this book would be good for boys and girls of a eighth grade reading level or higher."}, {"userName": "Jonah 713", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12764161-jonah-713", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the book Peak by Roland Smith. I found the characters to be interesting and very thought out as well as realistic, Especially the protagonist, Peak, a 14-year-old climber and his father, Joshua Wood. The story tells the tale of a boy, Peak, who makes an attempt to reach the summit of the tallest mountain in the world, Everest. The plot was that if peak reached the summit, he would be the youngest climber ever to conquer Everest. \tThis book really kept Josh\u2019s and Peaks relationship hanging around really throughout the whole story. Josh\u2019s father had left Peak for 8 years and then all of a sudden peak is sent to live with him because of an incident back home. Throughout the whole story Peak grapples with thoughts about his dad. Peak was a very realistic character, I could relate to his thoughts. \t\tPeak struggles with the idea that his dad, who works for an Everest climbing group is just trying to have Peak reach the summit for publicity. The reader really had to think like Peak. Some thoughts I infer were going through Peak\u2019s mind are he was probably scared. I mean he really didn\u2019t have a choice up on the mountain. He wasn\u2019t pressured by his father but my thought up on that mountain would be if Joshua Wood was my father I would think he was selfish and just trying to get publicity about his climbing group. I mean look at the story, this man abandoned his son for 8 years, I don\u2019t even know if I was his kid if I would\u2019ve had the courage Peak had to go live with him in a foreign place. Basically, what I\u2019m trying to say is Peak is a very complex realistic character. His dad takes action and he responds. Peak didn\u2019t handle everything perfectly, his inner thoughts were sometimes rude but I believe he responded to the tough situation well.\tI mean he had no choice, he was on the tallest mountain in the world but still, Peak Marcello was a brave, courageous character and I really enjoyed analyzing him. The book is good too!"}, {"userName": "NTE", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1226460-nte", "userReview": "I'm not big into survivalist YA - I know I'm a literacy major, but Hatchet made me wish I had one & The Lord of the Flies just made me want to cry - so it's probably good that I opened this book without knowing what to expect. (This comes from getting 99.99% of my books through PaperbackSwap & BookMooch - by the time they come, I have no recollection why they were added to the wishlist in the first place, and then, by the time I get around to reading them, I have usually no notion - besides cover clues & blurbs - of even what genre I might be reading. It's all very exciting, grab bag-surprise! ish.) So going into this not having any idea what I was in for was probably a good thing all around, because I probably would've groaned at the thought of reading about a kid trying to be the youngest person to ever hike up Mt Everest, and I would've missed out on a strong & complex story. There's a lot going on here - Peak, who hasn't seen his dad in years, gets into some serious trouble and his father's version of riding to the 'rescue' seems to be taking the 14 year old to Mt Everest, leaving him with his sherpa friend, and plotting behind his back. There's a lot of plotting going on around, behind, and involving Peak, and discovering it along the way is what made this story so interesting to me. Even the action-y sequences, with all the climbing lingo and stuff that would ordinarily bore me to tears, was very well written & I found myself engaged in Peak's climb, in spite of myself. Thinking back, I'm sure this came through the \"read this to see if it's something my 6th grader nephew might enjoy\" track, because I'm always looking for stuff he could read and NOT complain about how boring it is. *that he does not love reading as well as I do is a constant sadness for me* Hopefully, this is something he'll find as gripping as I did, and he'll be climbing up Everest this summer in spite of himself."}, {"userName": "Sarah Monsma", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32643123-sarah-monsma", "userReview": "Fourteen-year-old Peak Marcello is nearly two-thirds of the way through his secret goal when he gets nabbed, hauled by police onto the top of his latest skyscraper, even before he'd had a chance to tag it. Before Peak knows it he's been arrested, appeared in court before a judge, and he's headed out of the country in his father's custody, the father he hasn't even heard from in the past seven years. The worst part of it is, Peak's dad has an agenda\u2014an agenda that Peak's both excited about and scared of. Peak's dad wants his son to be the youngest person to climb Mt. Everest. Peak doesn't have any idea if he can make it, and there's a deadline, Peak's fifteenth birthday is coming up fast.Peak is an engrossing adventure story. Peak Marcello is a kid to be admired. He's strong, addicted to climbing (no surprise, since his parents were a legendary climbing team), and more than a little reckless. He's also been put in a crazy position where he's got to figure out how much he can handle, who he can trust, and whether or not he should cut and run.I loved this book for all kinds of reasons. I loved reading about cold Mount Everest on sweltering hot summer nights. I loved learning about the details of climbing Everest \u2013 you've got to go up and down bunches of time just to acclimate to the altitude. I loved accompanying Peak through his doubts and through his suspicions of everyone's motivations. Were his feelings real? Were they affected by lack of oxygen or physical duress? Why does everyone want something from him?This book moves right along, and I think it will draw in all types of readers. Peak is a great pick for classroom and school libraries. The Edge, the sequel to Peak, will be out in October. I'll be looking for it!I read Peak courtesy of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books for Young Readers and NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Wardrip", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1125613-jennifer-wardrip", "userReview": "Reviewed by Sally Kruger, aka \"Readingjunky\" for TeensReadToo.comHave you ever wondered what inspires people to climb mountains? What drives some to the highest peaks? Fourteen-year-old Peak Marcello was born to climb. Born to a couple of dedicated \"rock rats,\" Peak has climbing in his blood. Peak's parents are divorced. He hasn't heard from his father for years. Suddenly, after being arrested for illegally climbing a skyscraper, Peak finds himself on his way to Kathmandu to join his dad, famous climber, Joshua Wood. Forced to leave his mother, stepfather, and half-sisters behind, Peak has mixed feelings about the trip. It means spending time in some of the best climbing territory in the world. It also means spending time with a man who never answered his letters or bothered to get to know his own son. Once Peak arrives in the neighborhood of Mt. Everest, the real plan becomes evident. Joshua Wood runs an adventure/expedition company struggling to make ends meet. Taking the youngest ever person to the summit of Mt. Everest would assure the continued success of his company. Peak is just the fourteen year old for the job. Can he survive the brutal conditions and make it to the top? Will his father be able to protect him from the foreign authorities who have other ideas about who should be allowed to climb in their country? Peak Marcello is about to have the adventure of a lifetime. His mental as well as physical strength will be tested, and what is truly important in life will be revealed. Roland Smith, well-known for his adventure books, provides another great story for his fans. The struggle to survive on Mt. Everest, in addition to the thrilling attempt to reach its summit, makes for some fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat reading. I recommend PEAK for any teen collection."}, {"userName": "paula", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1543634-paula", "userReview": "I really enjoyed Smith's Cryptid Hunters, a page-turning, funny adventure story of two siblings and their globe-trotting uncle (father). Featuring nefarious villains and their henchmen, resourceful young people who confront their fears, and guest appearances by mokele-mbembe and Sasquatch, Cryptid Hunters pretty much hit all my buttons.Reading the jacket copy for Peak, I expected much of the same. Peak is a teenager in New York City who is a born mountain climber. The city is not his natural habitat, and he gets into big trouble. In swoops his estranged father, Josh, a world-famous climber, who trundles Peak off to Asia, buys him a bunch of climbing gear, and leaves him in the care of a Sherpa monk in Kathmandu. From there, we're off to Mount Everest at a breakneck pace. So far, so good: globe-trotting parent, exotic locale, physical challenges, extremely rapid pace.And there's no doubt, Peak is another page-turner. There's an interesting supporting cast, and the climb itself is described so vividly that I felt compelled to pull out our DVD of Everest: The Death Zone for accompanying visuals. Loyalties are called into question as Peak confronts his limitations, and eventually, after Learning Something About Himself, he resolves his moral dilemma and gains perspective on his life.Given this book's strengths, do I have to quibble with it? Well, apparently so. In the first place, I think the story suffers somewhat for the lack of a female contemporary for Peak. Also, Smith misses an opportunity to give even a brief overview of China's history with Tibet, especially since the bad guy in this show is a Chinese military man, and the border between Tibet and Nepal drives much of the plot. But it's a fine book."}, {"userName": "Lauren Mitchell", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23691344-lauren-mitchell", "userReview": "Lauren MitchellMr. ReickertEnglish 11 Honors9/2/15Peak, by Roland Smith, is a wonderful book based on the perspective of a fourteen year old named Peak whose parents lived and breathed climbing. The book demonstrates how a young trouble-maker can go from court to Mount Everest in a matter of a week or two with his father whom he has not seen in over half a decade. Overall, I enjoyed the book because of how Peak went through very tough circumstances, and made so much out of what he went through in his attempt to reach Everest's summit. The novel has an exceptionally, well-thought out plot that keeps one wanting to know if Peak will reach the summit by the end of the book. The beginning, on the other hand, is quite dragged-out, and I wasn't very interested in the story line until Peak arrived in Nepal. Overall, the novel had strengths such as demonstrating one's relationship between reality and Peak, specifically speaking about how one can overcome major obstacles with a growth mindset if they set themselves to it. In addition, the novel's only weaknesses are a dragged-out beginning, and there could have been more challenges added to the plot line, such as much more difficulties during his attempt that prevented him from even being there to try to reach the summit in the first place. In conclusion, Peak, by Roland Smith, is a magnificent read that draws the reader in as Peak gets closer to a shot at climbing the highest mountain on Earth."}], "description": "The only thing you\u2019ll find on the summit of Mount Everest is a divine view.
