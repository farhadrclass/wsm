I am hesitant to describe books as 'inspiring', but this story genuinely is. These two sisters had such a fantastic outlook on life, such an adventurous spirit, and Evelyn writes in such an entertaining, humorous and good-natured way it is not only a thoroughly enjoyable read it's also not surprising that so many people quickly became their friends, offered no end of help and wanted to come and stay with them on their island. I would too, in a heartbeat!"}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27217162-ellen", "userReview": "Fabulous couple of sisters who took on the near impossible and succeeded. Well worth a read. Now I want to visit the island."}], "description": "Evelyn Atkins and her sister Babs were two middle-aged spinsters who lived in suburban Surrey and led the humdrum life of so many commuters. Like others, Evelyn dreamed of owning an island. And Evelyn was a very determined daydreamer...Then Evelyn broke her leg and it meant an early retirement from her demanding job. The two sisters scraped together the money for a dilapidated cottage in Cornwall. From the cliffs they could see tiny Looe Island glimmering tantalisingly in the sunshine. Then came the momentous day when the island came up for sale. Needless to say, Evelyn and Babs were soon the proud - though somewhat bemused - owners. Life on an island certainly seemed to raise a lot of problems. But, while the locals looked on with scepticism, the two sisters, nothing daunted, rallied to meet the biggest adventure of their lives.", "title": "We Bought An Island\n      \n          (We Bought an Island  #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3633794-we-bought-an-island", "average": 3.73, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1394425727l/3633794.jpg", "reviews": 3, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1541195.Evelyn_E_Atkins", "name": "Evelyn E.
