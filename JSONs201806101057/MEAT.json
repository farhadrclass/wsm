When I looked into his books, I knew that MEAT had to be one of the first books of his that I read. Growing up, I would spend my summers in the country with my grandparents, and the local grocery store there was a Grueber's! The store is still there, but it has since changed into Buschs. Now I'm left wondering - was my Gruber's a specialty market? Did it pick up and move on to serve the special clients in another area? Possibly. I'll be sure to watch things a little more carefully from now on, because if I'm ever in need of some specialty meat - it had damned well be fresh & free range!! That's what caught Garrett's eye as he was strolling down the isle - the sign advertising today'special \u2026\n  Grueber\u2019s Free Range human foot!\n\n  White male left foot,\n\n  Pre washed and ready to cook.\n\n  Delicious, hot or cold!\nHe thought that was a bit odd, to say the least. This quick stop at the market had just turned into an experience, that if he made it out alive, he was sure he would never, ever> forget.I especially liked the direction that the author went with the characters. Human nature, my friends - It bites ya in the ass.I found a cool alternate cover on Amazon, too...image:"}, {"userName": "Mark Woods", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4786869-mark-woods", "userReview": "Just read this in a single day and have to say this is one of the best horror stories I have read in ages! It is absolutely grisly, gruesome and nasty ~ in other words, right up my street!A group of shoppers find themselves trapped in a new supermarket with no hope of escape. On the shelves are disembodied feet (seasoned ready for cooking), pickled eyes and fresh tongue kebabs - all mixed in amongst the usual produce. At first some of them think it is all some kind of sick, practical joke but when some of them try to leave, they quickly learn there is only one way they are getting out of this store...and it's not through the front doors!This is an awesome, awesome, awesome read and one hell of a ride! It is quite simply one of the best short horror novels that I have read in ages! It feels heavily influenced by Richard Laymon in places and is exceptionally nasty right through to the end. The climax alone will leave you gasping, let alone the rest of the novel! It really is a roller coaster ride from start to finish!This is the first piece of fiction I have read by author, Michael Bray but you can be certain, it won't be the last! I was left speechless, reeling and almost sickened at times by the sheer horror and brutality depicted within but you know what? Horror simply doesn't get much better than this!This is how much the book influenced me: mid-reading, I popped into my local Tesco Express to pick up a couple of things. Walking around the shelves, I found myself half-consciously looking around for disembodied limbs and decapitated heads - it wasn't till I got to the till that I realised what I had been doing! This is the sign of a good author, that he can so engross you in his writing that you find yourself actually living what you have been reading in your head! Few writers have this ability and so for M.Bray to achieve this shows just how good a writer he really is!"}, {"userName": "Reeda Booke", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11260161-reeda-booke", "userReview": "The sense of dread as you read this story is palpable. What was once a mundane chore, shopping for a few groceries, has become a horrific event! An entertaining story with an unexpected ending! Recommended!"}, {"userName": "Tracey Green", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60407928-tracey-green", "userReview": "Michael Bray has captured the feelings of fear and hopelessness well in this gory, tense and disturbing tale. I found this book very unnerving.\u00a0 I could almost imagine how it would feel to walk into a supermarket, see the items for sale on the shelves and eventually realise, for reasons not yet known to you, that you can't leave.\u00a0 I enjoyed watching the characters unravel, wondering who would be next to adopt the blank eyed stare and drooling mouth, or which character would be next to try something desperate. The animosity between the main character Garret and antagonist Bernard Winthorpe is interesting to observe, why is Winthorpe behaving the way he is, is it mere fear or something else? There is an almost tangible feel of 'them and us ' between the people in the store as they begin to come together into groups and tensions rise as the situation becomes clearer and even more extreme.\u00a0 I enjoyed the twist at the end, didn't see that coming!Highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Todd Russell", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5198301-todd-russell", "userReview": "I try mixing in indie author books from time to time, always hoping to find a rising star among the flotsam. Some indie books are pretty good and I've happily written about them (see Bottle Full of Scorpions review). This one involving people trapped by vampires in a grocery store with human body parts on the shelves was a bit of a rough read. It started out intriguing, which was why I kept reading, but then my interest waxed and waned throughout the rest of the story. The ending was better than I expected, even providing a bit of a twist. I wanted to feel a good connection with the main character, Garrett, but...just couldn't get there.The author writes in the afterword that he got the idea by visiting the grocery store (lol! Don't go shopping with him) and just started writing from there. Needed some more wild humor, because with the promising premise this could make a good bizarro humor story, perhaps even a pretty good one with more significant tweaking and polishing. It read in the condition I saw like slightly polished first draft material needing more editing and work. 2,240 Kindle Locations. Not recommended."}, {"userName": "Lisa Sandberg", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26878149-lisa-sandberg", "userReview": "Well that was definitely interesting, grotesque, horrifying, disturbing and very true to the human race.Ray Garrett finds himself in a supermarket, a very strange supermarket, full of disturbing merchandise and staff. He suddenly realizes what is happening and rallies to find others to help with an escape. The people are divided, some are against, some are willing and some are just like zombies wandering around the store. Finally a plan is in place, but things don't actually go as planned.This story is gripping and the ending will shock you. Michael Bray does a good job with this story. Keeping you reading to find out how they will get out of this one, if they can. 3.5 stars only because of the grammatical errors, but an overall 4 star rating for the story as a whole."}, {"userName": "Tamara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47378022-tamara", "userReview": "Gory good fun at the market ...

Little did he know that he would be walking into the supermarket of horrors. Not only is there freshly wrapped human limbs in the freezer it seems that escape isn't an option. Take a horror filled ride down the isles of Grueber's, and see what people will do in order to survive.I picked this book up thinking that it would be a nice read. I have found that most horror books don't really scare me or bother me at all. This book scared me bad, taking something as ordinary as a food store and making me never want to step foot into one ever again. Michael Bray has a gift for story telling, putting you inside the heads of a few different people and making you care about what is going to happen to them. Making you hope that they make it out of this alive. When you care about the characters in a book it makes it all the better.More then once I asked myself how I would have reacted if placed into a situation like that, and honestly I couldn't tell you. Half the time I would think that I would hold strong and try to escape, and the other half I would think that I would lose it and roam the isles with the rest of them. When a story makes you think like that you know it was good.The only thing I didn't like is that it reminded me a little of the movie The Mist, I have never read Stephen Kings book so I can't compare it to that, but the feeling of the movie was close to this story, only with different monsters. Other then that this book creeped me out hard core.Would I recommend it? Oh yeah I would, you never really want to watch a scary movie by yourself, same goes with a book. You need to spread that fear out to others so you can cope. Now if only I could convince myself that my local food stores are save to go into.http://zephyrbookreviews.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Jennifer Pelfrey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8067763-jennifer-pelfrey", "userReview": "Michael Bray creates a vampire like none I've ever read about before! He sneaks a little suspicion into your head about the reality of them living among us being a possibility.Going about their daily business of running errands, a group of people becomes trapped in a supermarket. But, if you look closely at the shelves, and meat counter, you will see this is not your typical neighborhood grocery store. The group of people must band together to make it out, but as with all groups of gathered people, there is always that one tyrant among the group who wants to take over. People choose sides, all hell breaks loose, and in a surprising twist, Bray made my entire faith in humanity crumble."}, {"userName": "Frankie Yates", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33664661-frankie-yates", "userReview": "Really really enjoyed this clever twist on a vampire story. It was so unique and such an entertaining read. The only thing that I didn't like about this book was that within the first few pages, the word 'bulimic' was used to describe the way someone looked. With some of the extreme horror books I read that might seem like a daft thing to get offended by, but it just touched a raw nerve and I'll be honest I'm not at all sure why the word was used to describe how thin the character was. Other than that, this was definitely one of the best books I've read this year."}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "Im glad I waited to eat my dinner for this AND that I had already been shopping and got out alive!Can I ever enter a supermarket again.....A great moral tale with a sting, and a bite, a chop, the odd missing foot and various other nasties.Well written, the odd missing word or letter - might that might be due to formatting.Really looking forward to a novel from this author, although this was a really long novella!Brilliant"}, {"userName": "Keith Norman", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44580284-keith-norman", "userReview": "An intriguing story that I thought would go stale and fail to keep me entertained turned into a page turner.
