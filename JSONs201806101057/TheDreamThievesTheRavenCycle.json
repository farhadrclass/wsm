Something new for every night.\u201dThis review contains *spoilers*.The Dream Thieves picks up right where The Raven Boys left off.Gansey still searches the mountains of Virginia for the legendary Welsh king Glendower, a quest made more plausible by the group\u2019s discovery of a creepy, sentient, magical forest called Cabeswater.But in this book, all of this takes a back seat to Ronan\u2019s confession on the last page of The Raven Boys: he can take things out of his dreams.I\u2019ve had trouble sleeping lately, so I found Ronan\u2019s dreams and the whole process of taking something from the dreams really intriguing. But while this book did not help with increasing my sleep (I stayed up way too late because of this book), it did help with feeling a little relieved that my nightmares can\u2019t come to life. \u201cIn that moment, Blue was a little in love with all of them. Their magic. Their quest. Their awfulness and strangeness. Her raven boys.\u201dRight there with you, Blue.I really appreciated how natural the friendships between the boys and Blue felt. The raven boys all hold a special place in my heart (especially Ronan). They are so complex and dynamic and beautiful.Ronan Lynch is incredibly charming in a way that\u2019s physically painful to me, and he\u2019s funny, and so, so sweet underneath all his hard exterior. I\u2019m just really attached to him\u2014 I\u2019m kind of scared of how close I feel to him. At this point I don't even think of him as a character in a book, he feels so real.And I loved that we got to read more of his point of view.\u201cAt night, the longing for home was ceaseless and omniscient, an airborne contaminant. He saw it in Dollar City\u2019s cheap oven mitts \u2014 that was his mother at dinnertime. He heard it in the slam of the cash register drawer \u2014 that was his father coming home at midnight. He smelled it in the sudden whiff of air freshener \u2014 that was the family trips to New York.\u201dI love Ronan. So much.And Adam continues to break pieces of my heart. I completely understood how he was feeling at the beginning of the story and I really felt for him and the financial situation he was in. \u201cPeople who said money couldn\u2019t buy everything hadn\u2019t seen anyone as rich as the Aglionby boys. They were untouchable, immune to life\u2019s troubles. Only death couldn\u2019t be swiped away by a credit card.\u201dBut I wished he would be less angry to the people that really cared about him.\u201cHe became aware that Blue was watching him, her lips pursed, eyebrows tight.\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d he said.\u201cLike what? I\u2019m not allowed to be worried about you?\u201dHeat hissed through his voice. \u201cI don\u2019t want your pity.\u201dIf Gansey wasn\u2019t allowed to pity him, Blue sure as hell wasn\u2019t allowed to. She and Adam were in the same boat, after all. Wasn\u2019t she on her way to work, the same as he\u2019d just come from it?Blue said, \u201cThen don\u2019t be pitiful!\u201dAlso, Ronan returning to his childhood home was something I didn\u2019t know I needed until it appeared in the book.\u201cGansey looked at Ronan.Ronan rubbed a studious thumb beneath one of the leather straps, wiping away the grime and sweat. He wondered when he\u2019d ever be back. Softly, just for Gansey, he asked, \u201cCan I go and see Mom?\u201dIf before I didn\u2019t love him so much that my heart hurt, I certainly did after that part.He showed this whole new side of himself and I\u2019m crying.This book seriously increased my love for Ronan so much. And I\u2019m totally going to listen to sappy love music because of him. \u201cIt\u2019s awake,\u201d he said. Lifting his hand, he pressed the tiny body to his cheek so that he could feel the flutter of its rapid heartbeat against his skin. Blue was staring at him, so he offered it to her. \u201cYou can feel its heart that way.\u201dShe looked suspicious. \u201cAre you for real? Are you messing with me?\u201d\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a bastard, and this doesn\u2019t seem like a typical bastard activity.\u201dHe smiled thinly. \u201cDon\u2019t get used to it.\u201dI love it when he smiles.\u201cWhere Gansey\u2019s ancestral home was a no-touch museum of elegant, remote things, the Barns was a warren of pool tables and quilts, video game cords and shoddily expensive leather couches.Ronan loved it so much. He nearly couldn\u2019t bear it. He wanted to destroy something.\u201dThis is how I feel about Ronan.I also still really enjoy Blue\u2019s family. They feel so real and are so well written that I sometimes forget they only exist in this storyline. Oh, and when the Gray Man started flirting with Maura over the phone I started laughing so hard. I had to no idea what to take from that conversation. But they actually surprised me with how well they went along. Are they a thing now?\u201cDo you know, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen you wearing shoes. Oh, so \u2014 what\u2019s going on there?\u201dMaura glanced over her shoulder to where he pointed. A small, weary Ford had just pulled up behind the Gray Man\u2019s rental car. \u201cOh, that\u2019s Calla. She\u2019s following us to the restaurant to make sure you\u2019re really taking me there and not burying me in the woods.\u201dThe Gray Man said, \u201cHow ridiculous. I never bury anybody.\u201dCalla gave a mean-spirited wave in his general direction. Her fingers were claws on the steering wheel.\u201d(I really liked Maura\u2019s honesty when he took her out for dinner.)Another part that made me laugh was when Noah and Blue were at Monmouth Manufacturing while Gansey and Ronan were away.\u201cNoah rubbed the smudge on his cheek. It didn\u2019t go away. It never did. He said, \u201cI know somebody you could kiss.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d She realized his eyes were amused. \u201cOh, wait.\u201dHe shrugged. He was maybe the only person Blue knew who could preserve the integrity of a shrug while lying down. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to kill me. I mean, if you were curious.\u201dNoah surprised me so much when he said that. And Blue surprised me even more when she accepted.The first kiss between them made me laugh so hard that tears started streaming down my eyes. But with that last kiss they were incredibly sweet with each other.\u201cBlue gave him a watery smile. \u201cThat was super nice.\u201dHe shrugged, eyes doleful, shoulders curled in on themselves. He was fading. It wasn\u2019t that she could see through him. It was that it was hard to remember what he looked like, even while she was looking at him. When he turned his head, she saw him swallow. He mumbled, \u201cI\u2019d ask you out, if I was alive.\u201dNothing was fair.\u201cI\u2019d say okay,\u201d she replied.\u201dAnd now I'm crying again. I was also glad that Blue finally admitted to herself that she had feelings for Gansey.\u201cAs they baked in the sunlight, she let herself think it:I have a crush on Richard Gansey.\u201dI really appreciate the fact that the romance is developing slowly, so that we can focus first on the chemistry between the characters.But when it did shift to the romance between Gansey and Blue, it was so good. \u201cHe closed his eyes and leaned, just a little, so that her palm was flat on his neck, fingers sprawled from his ear to his shoulder.Everything in Blue was charged. Say something. Say something.Gansey lifted her hand gently from his skin, holding it as formally as a dance. He put it against his mouth.Blue froze. Absolutely still. Her heart didn\u2019t beat. She didn\u2019t blink. She couldn\u2019t say don\u2019t kiss me. She couldn\u2019t even form don\u2019t.He just leaned his cheek and the edge of his mouth against her knuckles and then set her hand back.\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t.\u201dThey left me completely breathless and so emotional. Oh, and while I\u2019m on the topic of people that make me feel really emotional, Ronan broke me in the best way towards the end. \u201cRonan stretched out his arms. \"What\u2019s here, K? Nothing! No one!\u201d\u201cJust us.\u201dThere was a heavy understanding in that statement, amplified by the dream. I know what you are, Kavinsky had said.\u201cThat\u2019s not enough,\u201d Ronan replied.\u201cDon\u2019t say Dick Gansey, man. Do not say it. He is never going to be with you. And don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t swing that way, man. I\u2019m in your head.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what Gansey is to me,\u201d Ronan said.\u201cYou didn\u2019t say you don\u2019t swing that way.\u201dRonan was silent. Thunder growled under his feet. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201dI love Ronan so, so much.I feel like this review is just me gushing about Ronan, but he\u2019s really worth all the gushing.So this series is quickly becoming an all time favorite of mine. There wasn\u2019t even one dull moment in The Dream Thieves. I truly can\u2019t believe it took me so long to start this incredible series.*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

Set shortly after the events of The Raven Boys, the students of Aglionby Academy are still on the hunt for a legendary sleeping Welsh king. This time, while we continue to get perspectives from multiple POVs, the story primarily focuses on Ronan Lynch, a troubled and angry 17-year-old who pulls dark objects out of his dreams. But when ley lines running through their sleepy town are awakened, incredible power is unleashed, and none of the boys are prepared for the ordeal that awaits them.I liked The Raven Boys so much that I was nervous going into this one--but I think this book actually surpasses its predecessor, in no small part because of its sharp-eyed character sketches. Adam still worries me. I feel tremendous love and pity for poor Noah. I'm eager to learn more about the entire Lynch clan. And I'm finally starting to feel something for Gansey, as well as to feel the lovely pulse of connection between him and Blue. Add to that a pair of compelling, nuanced antagonists in The Gray Man and one willfully destructive Joseph Kavinsky, and this world is filled with a host of unforgettable players. The author has the ability to create such fierce depth of feeling towards her characters with a single phrase such as \"a teddy bear of a boy,\" in reference to Ronan's younger brother Matthew, whom you immediately want to cuddle and protect all at once.I haven't been able to stop thinking about this book since I finished it. I have so many crazy theories about where this quest will lead, and I desperately want to know what happens to everyone. Aside from thrilling, nightmarish scenes, gorgeous prose, wild revelations, shocking deaths, and clever humor, there are also delicious layers to this novel that you may not fully appreciate until after you're through, including distinct symbolism (both subtle and powerful), sly hidden jokes, and a deep complexity of thought and plot and emotion. It's such an interesting meditation on the power of dreams and how hidden desire can influence our actions, from Ronan's waking nightmares to his mother and father's unusual relationship to...more yearnings that I won't spoil for you.I could also write an entire essay about how The Dream Thieves contains one of the most beautiful, heartbreaking kisses in the history of kisses. (Yes. The ENTIRE HISTORY of kisses.) It's a delicate moment that's suffused with the breathless wonder of discovery, and it's all the more poignant because it's entirely unexpected, and because you are well aware of its context for both parties. Tears are literally welling up in my eyes again as I write this, because that type of longing and sadness pulls so deeply at my heart.There isn't any way for a single review to do justice to this book, but this line from The Dream Thieves sums up its own story rather nicely:\nMagic was real, magic was real, magic was real.\n And it runs deep and true through Maggie Stiefvater's veins. This review also appears in The Midnight Garden. An advance copy was provided by the publisher.P.S There's a huge spoiler-tagged discussion going on down below with theories on what everything MEANS, if you'd care to speculate. But please use spoiler tags!I also participated in a rather epic chat with several authors about this book, including Sarah Ockler and R.J. Anderson--and let me tell you, there are no better companions to discuss a story like this with than a bunch of smart, passionate authors who are just as excited about the book as you are. One of the mind-blowing takeaways from that discussion: consider the characters as tarot cards.!!!! I want to reread this book immediately."}, {"userName": "Raeleen Lemay", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3452652-raeleen-lemay", "userReview": "I JUST LOVE RONAN SO MUCH OK??ok I'm adding more.I really love how subtle Maggie Stiefvater is when it comes to the \"big things\" that happen in terms of the characters and what's going on. I don't want to talk about it too much because of spoilers, but I feel like some authors try to shove information down your throat, but Maggie knows how to do it in a much more natural, REALISTIC way, so much so that you don't even really realize she did it until it's done. So magnificent. The characters feel like actual people, and their relationships develop in a real and natural way, and I can't get enough. I adore them."}, {"userName": "Virginia Ronan \u2665 Herondale \u2665", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69106439-virginia-ronan-herondale", "userReview": "\u201dAll of us have secrets in our lives. We\u2019re keepers or kept-from, players or played. Secrets and cockroaches \u2013 that\u2019s what will be left at the end of it all.\u201dOh god what can I say about this book?\nI loved it!!!\nI loved it with all my heart and even though I never wanted it to end I still wanted to know what would happen next! XD Seriously, there is something about the way Maggie Stiefvater describes her world, how she expresses the countless feelings of her characters. With Maggie things are never perfunctory. They are deep, deep like a well or an ancient ocean! Her words drag you into the water; they carry you out into the raging sea!Every gesture, every single moment, every sentence, they all have some meaning and if you\u2019re perceptive enough you can read between the lines. I adore her writing style and I just can\u2019t seem to get enough of her characters! They\u2019re all special in their own way and every one of them is just so tangible and real! I felt like I was part of her story, like I knew those boys and their troubles and thoughts. I can\u2019t seem to be able to describe what Maggie\u2019s books do to me, all I can say is that they are magical and credible and always force me to feel!!! And oh boy, how they force me to feel!!! XDTo read \u201cThe Dream Thieves\u201d was incredible and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even possible, but I think I love all those different boys even more than I did before!!! <333The plot:\u201dRonan Lynch, keeper of secrets, fighter of men, devil of a boy, had told them all that he could take objects out of his dreams.\u201dWell, I guess that quote already explains it all! The second book of the Raven Cycle is dealing with Ronan Lynch\u2019s ability to take things from dreams and if you know Ronan, you also know that he has many secrets and isn\u2019t as tough as he comes across! XD Still, even though the main focus lies on Ronan and his family, the other characters play a huge part in the book as well! So don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s still a lot to read about the other precious Aglionby Boys and Blue! ;-P The characters:\u201dBut the boys were not looking at the scenery. They stood in a close circle: Adam Parrish, gaunt and fair, Noah Czerny, smudgy and slouching; and Ronan Lynch, ferocious and dark.\u201d\nHere we go with my typical spoiler warning! From now on you\u2019ll find yourself bombarded with spoilers and quotes! So beware and tread carefully!!!\nGansey:\u201dShe would see a rich boy dressed like a mannequin and coiffed like a newscaster \u2013 but his eyes were like the dreaming pool in Cabeswater. He hid the insatiable wanting well, but now that she\u2019d seen it once, she couldn\u2019t stop seeing it.\u201dRichard Gansey the III, the golden boy who seems to have everything but is so lonely that it hurts! Oh boy did I feel sorry for him throughout the entire book! He always tried to fix everything and his friends are like brothers to him, yet he\u2019s never able to tell them how he truly feels. It was so frustrating to watch him, to see how he struggled and couldn\u2019t put his thoughts into words! Gansey is such a delicate soul but for some reason no one seems to get him. T_T He would do everything for his boys and I think he proved that more than once; as it seems they all have their problems to accept his help though. Still, I liked that we finally saw some other parts of Gansey\u2019s personality as well! For instance his wild side and how he became friends with Adam! XD I love Gansey but he\u2019s so lonesome and driven by his need to find Glendower that it\u2019s sometimes almost painful to read his POV! >_<\u201dOnce, he had dreamt that he found Glendower. It wasn\u2019t the actual finding, but the day after. He wouldn\u2019t forget the sensation of the dream. It hadn\u2019t been joy, but instead, the absence of pain. He couldn\u2019t forget that lightness. The freedom.\u201dThere were many versions of Gansey, but this one had been rare since the introduction of Adam\u2019s taming presence. It was also Ronan\u2019s favourite. It was the opposite of Gansey\u2019s most public face, which was pure control enclosed in a paper-thin wrapper of academia.\u201dBlue:\u201dBlue was a fanciful but sensible thing, like a platypus, or one of those sandwiches that had been cut into circles for a fancy tea party.\u201dI still like Blue but there were some things that caused me to be annoyed at her. For instance the fact that she didn\u2019t want to tell Adam why she would never kiss him. I mean, I understand her reasons to keep it from him, but I think she could have chosen her words a little more carefully. I know Adam kind of drove her into a corner, I\u2019m pretty certain that he would have understood it if she would have told him sooner though! But then again she is young and inexperienced and has no idea how to deal with boys so I guess this kind of works in her favor. *lol* Still, this was already the second book and I still have the feeling that I don\u2019t know her! I really hope this is going to change in the next book!!!Blue put a hand on his chest and pressed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kiss you. It\u2019s not going to be you and me.\u201dAdam:\u201dAs always, his features intrigued Blue. They were not quite conventionally handsome, but they were interesting. He had the typical Henrietta prominent cheekbones and deep-set eyes, but his version of them was more delicate. It made him seem a little alien. A little impenetrable.\u201dAdam Parrish destroyed me!!! This boy broke my heart in so many different ways I can\u2019t even count it anymore. My heart ached and bled for him!!! It was devastating to watch his decline!!! And oh god, that moment when he ran away and didn\u2019t even remember Gansey\u2019s phone number?!! I can\u2019t even!!! It killed me to see him like that, to know that he was so broken and couldn\u2019t seem to be able to fix it!! Hell, even Adam knew it!!! He was completely aware of his degeneration and that made it even harder to bear!!! I was so glad that Persephone helped him to find himself and encouraged him to make peace with Cabeswater! Their relationship was amazing and to know that Adam finally found his way and became \u201cThe Magician\u201d filled me with joy!!!! =))) I bet he\u2019s going to be powerful in the future and I can\u2019t wait to see it happening!!! XD\u201dIt was nothing, but it was Adam Parrish\u2019s nothing. How he hated and loved it. How proud he was of it, how wretched it was.\u201d\u201dDo you think you\u2019re a train wreck?\u201d\u201cThat would mean I was on the tracks to start with,\u201d he replied.\u201dHe would be Cabeswater\u2019s hands and Cabeswater\u2019s eyes, but he wouldn\u2019t be Cabeswater.He would be Adam Parrish.\u201dRonan:\u201dAnd Ronan was everything that was left: molten eyes and a smile made for war.\u201dRonan Lynch is my precious boy!!! I love him to bits and pieces!!! The fact this book was about him and his family made me so happy and to read his POV was just amazing!! I love that he\u2019s a walking and talking oxymoron and even though he seems to be so tough he\u2019s actually a softie on the inside! *lol* AND OMG!!! I knew it!!!! I knew he was gay and had feelings for ADAM!!! YASSSS!!! There were so many hints in this book and the conversations with Kavinsky definitely helped to figure it out! We finally got to see the real Ronan and I\u2019m thankful for every second of it. He cares about his family deeply (well everyone except of Declan of course ;-P) and to find out about his nightmares was more than just a revelation. I mean the fact Ronan tried to kill himself never set well with me and I couldn\u2019t imagine him to commit suicide. So to find out that it had been the monsters of his dreams was kind of relieving but also disturbing. *lol* Also I\u2019m pretty certain that Declan and him are at odds because he\u2019s gay. There\u2019s no palpable proof yet, but I think I read it between the lines! ;-P \u201dHis gaze followed his brother\u2019s leg to where it rested on top of Adam\u2019s and his expression tightened.\u201d\u201dDon\u2019t fucking swear,\u201d Ronan said.\u201dThat\u2019s not what Gansey is to me,\u201d Ronan said.\u201cYou didn\u2019t say you don\u2019t swing that way.\u201dRonan was silent. Thunder growled under his feet. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t.\u201dNoah:\u201dThe last six minutes, the ones that took place after Noah had first fallen but before he actually died, were excruciating. Blue considered herself a fairly steadfast, sensible girl, but no matter how many times she heard his torn-up breath seizing in his throat, she felt a little teary.\u201dI really wish we would have seen more of Noah, but since he\u2019s connected to the ley line and Kavinsky and Ronan made it a habit to mess with it through the entire book, there really wasn\u2019t any chance to get to know him better. Still, I love this boy and the kiss between him and Blue was so bittersweet!! It broke my heart into tiny little pieces and I think I\u2019ll remember this moment forever! Oh god, how I wish that Noah could be happy! That he\u2019d find someone who loves him and accepts him the way he is! As a wonderful and lovable ghost that never got a chance to live!!! Maggie please let him be happy in the next two books!!! Because my heart bleeds for this amazing boy and I couldn\u2019t take it if he\u2019d be unhappy for the rest of his undead life!!! T_T\u201dI know somebody you could kiss.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d She realized his eyes were amused. \u201cOh, wait.\u201d He shrugged. He was maybe the only person Blue knew who could preserve the integrity of a shrug while lying down.\u201d\u201dI\u2019d ask you out, if I was alive.\u201dNothing was fair.\u201cI\u2019d say okay,\u201d she replied.She only had time to see him smile faintly. And then he was gone.Kavinsky:Ronan replied, \u201cNot such a thief tonight.\u201d\u201cSome nights,\u201d Kavinsky said, all teeth, \u201cyou just take it. Consent is overrated.\u201dHe\u2019s such a numpty but I still liked him somehow? I don\u2019t know! XD There was something about him that made him really intriguing and even though I knew that he was bad I still had the irrational hope that he would be able to change for the better. It was so obvious that he was unhappy with his life and would have needed some help, yet I\u2019m still sure that he would have never accepted it. He definitely was gay and he SOOO had the hots for Ronan!!! *lol* His death might have been unnecessary but it certainly wasn\u2019t unexpected\u2026 RIP Joseph Kavinsky! >_<\u201dAfter a moment, he heard the hood groan as Kavinsky leaned over him. Then he felt the ridged callus of a finger drag slowly over the skin on his back. A slow arc between his shoulder blades, drawing the pattern of his tattoo. Then sliding down his spine, tensing every muscle it moved over.\u201d\u201dThe world\u2019s a nightmare.\u201dThe Gray Man:\u201dThe king of swords, master of his own emotions, master of his own intellect, master of reason, gazed out at them, expression inscrutable.\u201dHa! That man gave me anxiety!!! *lol* I was so worried that he\u2019d hurt Ronan and after the scene with Declan I actually feared for Ronan\u2019s life!!! But then the Gray Man met Maura and everything changed! XD The chapters from his POV were really interesting and I liked the idea of him being a hit man! ;-) He was a great addition to the cast and I can\u2019t wait to see more of him and Maura! Because truth be told, they actually were cute as hell!! *grins like a Cheshire cat* \u201dI\u2019m sorry no one saved you.\u201dWas he unsaved? Would he have ever ended up any other way?\u201dMaura kissed the back of his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be brave.\u201dThe Gray Man said, \u201cI\u2019m always brave.\u201dShe said, \u201cBraver than that.\u201dThe friendships:\nAdam & Gansey\n\u201dIf Adam was stupid about his pride, Gansey was stupid about Adam.\u201dI hated that they quarrelled so often but I loved it when Gansey spoke with his friend Malory and made Adam laugh!!! Their friendship was really tense in this book, but I think it was good this way. They had to work things out and realise where they were standing and without conflict they would have never even gotten that far! Sometimes it needs friction to find out who you are and to say there was a lot of it between Adam and Gansey certainly would be the understatement of the century. *lol* \u201dHe hated the careful way Gansey had asked him about it. Tiptoeing, just like Adam had learned to tiptoe around his father.\u201dGansey couldn\u2019t shake the image of Adam by the side of the interstate, walking, walking, walking. Knowing he was forgetting what he was doing, but unable to stop. Unable to remember Gansey\u2019s number, even when people did stop to help.\u201d\nRonan & Noah\n\u201dAdam thinks he saw an apparition at his place.\u201dRonan eyed Noah. \u201cI\u2019m seeing an apparition right now.\u201dThose two were hilarious!!! *LOL* I loved it when Ronan threw Noah out of the window!!! They have such a close relationship and it\u2019s awesome that Ronan treats Noah like he would treat any other boy! (Well, except of throwing him out of the window of course! XD) Noah knows about Ronan\u2019s feelings for Adam but he respects Ronan\u2019s wishes and that\u2019s amazing!!! <333 He\u2019s a really good friend and I hope I\u2019ll see more of their interactions in the next book! =)))\u201dNoah,\u201d Ronan said tenderly, placing his palm on top of Noah\u2019s cold, seven-years-dead hand, \u201cyou\u2019re starting to piss me off.\u201d\nRonan & Gansey:\n\u201dThere was never a time when that could\u2019ve been you and me. You know the difference between us and Kavinsky? We matter.\u201dLove those two boys! I think it\u2019s kind of funny that Ronan thinks Adam tamed Gansey, because it\u2019s actually what Gansey is doing with him! *lol* Gansey is the voice of reason and they complement each other so perfectly it\u2019s kind of beautiful to watch! ;-) \u201dHis face went somber for half a second, and then it dissolved into an absolutely wonderful and fearless laugh. The old Ronan Lynch\u2019s laugh. No, it was better than that one, because this new one had just a hint of darkness beneath it. This Ronan knew there was crap in the world, but he was laughing anyway.\u201dThe ships:\nGansey & Blue :\n\u201dIn some parallel universe, there was a Gansey who could tell Blue that he found the ten inches of her bare calves far more tantalizing than the thirteen cubic feet of bare skin Orla sported.\u201dIt's somehow amusing that Gansey sees Blue as a glorious and fearless animal! Haha! But then again that\u2019s just Gansey\u2019s typical way to describe the people around him! XD I loved their telephone conversations and their easy banter!!! And I was happy that they called each other whenever they felt troubled and alone! PLUS that almost kiss between them GAVE ME LIFE!!!! <333 Oh my, how my heart skipped a beat when I read that scene!!! XD\u201dHe pressed his eyes closed. Just the sound of her voice, the Henrietta lull to it, made him feel uneven and shattered.\u201d\u201dHa! Adam\u2019s communing with trees and Noah keeps re-enacting being murdered and Ronan\u2019s wrecking and then making me new cars. What\u2019s new with you? Something terrible, I trust?\u201d\u201dHe leaned towards her \u2013 her heart spun again \u2013 and pressed his cheeks against hers. His lips didn\u2019t touch her skin, but she felt his breath, hot and uneven, on her face. His fingers splayed on either side of her spine. Her lips were so close to his jaw that she felt his hint of stubble at the end of them. It was mint and memories and the past and the future and she felt as if she\u2019d done this before and already she longed to do it again.\u201d\nRonan & Adam aka Ronam!!! (I know the official ship name is Pynch but for me they\u2019ll always be Ronam! <333):\n\u201dRonan sometimes dreamt of Adam, too, the latter boy sullen and elegant and fluently disdainful of dream-Ronan\u2019s clumsy attempts to communicate.\u201dI still want to know how Ronan tried to communicate!!! *LOOOL* All those little moments between those two gave me SO MUCH LIFE!!! They still kept their distance and didn\u2019t say anything, but oh boy what they thought and how they acted around each other!!!! By the end of the book I was nothing but a babbling mess and the epilogue literally killed me!!!! OH GOD!!! I\u2019M STILL NOT OVER IT!!! I knew Adam was Ronan\u2019s second secret and I WANT to see more of them!!! Their interactions at the Barns were so explicit! That moment with the mask and when Adam said that he couldn\u2019t kill Ronan\u2019s demons! They know each other\u2019s soul and they are just meant to be together!!! Knowing Maggie this love is going to be a slow burn though and I really don\u2019t know if my tortured and tormented soul will be able to take it! XD \u201dAnd he was the boy with the most beautifully interesting car and the most savagely handsome of friends, Ronan Lynch.\u201d\u201dThe mask clattered to the floor. Adam, startled, stared at where Ronan\u2019s hand gripped his wrist. Ronan could feel his own heart pounding and, in Adam\u2019s wrist, Adam\u2019s.\u201d\u201dAdam looked up at Ronan. \u201cI know it was you,\u201d he said. \u201cI figured it out. The rent.\u201dHe held Ronan\u2019s gaze for just a moment longer, until something inside Ronan unwound and he almost said something.\u201dRonan\u2019s second secret was Adam Parrish. Adam was different since making the bargain with Cabeswater. Stronger, stranger, farther away. It was hard not to stare at the odd and elegant lines of his face.\u201dThe bottom line:THIS BOOK WAS INCREDIBLE!!!! I loved it even more than \u201cThe Raven Boys\u201d and if it would be possible to give more than five stars I wouldn\u2019t even hesitate to do it!!! Maggie Stiefvater knows exactly what she\u2019s doing and to say she\u2019s doing it perfectly wouldn\u2019t even get close to the truth! ;-)P.S: This was a buddy read with the amazing Lior!!! Seriously, I probably wouldn\u2019t have survived to read this book if I wouldn\u2019t have been able to fangirl with you!!! <333"}, {"userName": "C.G.

You guys! Guys. This book, guys. This frickin' book!Spoilers below so avert your eyes you Dream Thief virgins.*Foams at mouth*How is it possible that a second book is better than the first book, which was out of this world amazing? It's hard, but man. This book. This book is everything YA should be. Everything YA Paranormal should be. It's everything that's good about my life, really. It's that good.The writing? Amazing, as well. The characters were all badass. Like, so badass. Everyone was. I even ended up liking Mr. Grey and in the last book I thought he was a totally evil bastard. PS. Where's Neeve?Man. Just. Man. I don't know where to start with reviews like this because the book blew me away. I wish I could tell you what was good about it, but it was all amazing.The Raven Boys... who doesn't love them? Gansey? God. I'm so in love with him. My desires towards this book character are so real, they're tangible. It's pathetic and I don't care.\nGansey added, \u201cI would\u2019ve thought you had more muscles. Don\u2019t feminists have big muscles?\u201d Decidedly not in love with him.\nThere were so many parts of this book that shocked me. Things that were hinted at in the first book but you never caught onto and then this book exposed them and left you all \"wtffff?!\" Like the end of chapter 20 when Ronan found out his mom was a DREAM! DUDE! I lost my shit! I actually said, \"Awwwww shiiitttt!\"And this book is funny. Damn, is it ever funny. The wording is like, for smart teenagers, and kind of underhanded humor, which is perfect. \nGansey couldn\u2019t understand the speed of it. One moment, she was wearing clothing, and the next moment, she was wearing a bikini. Fifty percent of the world was browned skin and fifty percent was orange nylon. From the Mona Lisa smile on Orla\u2019s lips, it was clear she was pleased to finally be allowed to demonstrate her true talents.A tiny part of Gansey\u2019s brain said: You have been staring for too long.The larger part of his brain said: ORANGE.\nI love stories where things seem... possible. They don't live in an alternate universe where magic exists, they live in this one and happen to come across it. Well, happen is a bad word. Search feverishly seems more like it. But you really have to be careful when you create that kinda plot.. and yeah. It was perfect.\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m gone,\u201d Gansey said, pausing, \u201cdream me the world. Something new for every night.\u201d\nBest part of this book? BEST PART? Uh, duh. The ROMANCE!I loved Blue x Adam in the first book, but always loved Blue as one of the best YA characters ever, same with Gansey, and I still would've liked them to be together. And in this book? Oh, you get lots of hints and signs of their obvious affection. I'm not even saying the best romance was Blue x Gansey, even though it maybe was for me. Can I just say I totally knew it about Ronan? Man, I read a lot of M/M books. They're my primary diet. I just know when shit is up, and I knew that boy liked boys. The way he noticed Gansey's smile, his laugh, and was always watching him. Even if he seen him as a brother, he was still always noticing Gansey. And god, book #3 better have some serious Adam x Ronan going on in order for me to live the rest of my life happily.\nHe was struck by what a glorious and fearless animal Blue Sargent was, and he made a mental note to tell her that very thing, if she didn\u2019t drown getting whatever the second thing was.\n\n\u201cI wish you could be kissed, Jane,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I would beg just one off you. Under all this.\u201d He flailed an arm toward the stars. \u201cAnd then we\u2019d never say anything about it again.\u201d\nHow can a book with virtually nothing physical at all in it, barely even kissing, be so sexy and romantic? I don't even KNOW! Ask Maggie Stiefvater, because she seems to have that shit in the BAG.\nShe scratched her calf with her bare foot. She wore a dress Ronan thought looked like a lampshade. Whatever sort of lamp it belonged on, Gansey clearly wished he had one.\nThis book is so sweet and so cool and nothing boring is ever happening and I hung on every word like it was the edge of a cliff. If you like YA, especially YA Paranormal, read this series guys, but I just know there will be even greater parts of this series in the future.Previous reviewI'm sorry, what?I have to wait... an entire...

(In all honesty, I'm already halfway through Blue Lily, Lily Blue and this series is kicking ass so far).There comes occasions where though it's not a 5 star book... When the rating doesn't really matter at the end, because whether you give this series one star or all the stars in the damn universe. It still is unforgettable. ______________\nSimplicity\n\n\n\u201cArbores loqui latine. The trees speak Latin.\u201d \n\nI think I've found the trend. It's the whole aspect of getting together a group of misfits and seeing them do/go through such strange things, but living a mundane life. I've seen myself fall in love with TV shows, movies and other series that follow the same pattern. I can really only describe it as being bittersweet. With such a dense plotline filled with so many story arcs and side character stories, we see this ragtag group intersect themselves into each other and start to stitch together themselves as people. It's that simplicity and effortlessness that really shines out for me. There was a scene in the beginning with Gansey on the phone, and all you can develop from the background is that Ronan and Noah are messing around and being teenage boys. Till all of a sudden, you find out that Ronan pushed Noah off the window. It was a filler scene and it still is one of my favorites in the whole series so far. \nChocolate Ship Cookies\n\n\n\u201cIt was a sort of ferocious, quiet beauty, the sort that wouldn't let you admire it. The sort of beauty that always hurt.\u201d \n\nWell damn. I'm going to admit, The Raven Boys  didn't open me to hardcore ships. I had inklings of where certain pairings were heading but if anything, I fell in love with the platonic friendships in the first book. The Dream Thieves was a slap to the face. Quite literally every pair in this book (even the ones that were unconventional) made my heart sing: 1) Adam and Ronan broke into my house one day and with ones thievery and the others magic. They have taken my heart. 2) I am getting huge Blue and Gansey vibes and I've been waiting a whole book for this. PULL THROUGH DREAM TEAM. (Yogurt is the mascot.) 3) I love Noah. He deserves the milkyway galaxy. 4) Maura and The Gray Man. *squiggly eyebrows*5) A raven and his raven boy. A story about how a hard-ass stayed up all night nurturing an animal from his dreams, and secretly has a heart of gold. (Fanart by Matt) \nThoughts\n\n\n\u201cWhile I'm gone,\" Gansey said, pausing, \"dream me the world. Something new for every night.\u201d \n\n(Note: For anyone who's watched Stranger Things, I see Gansey as a total Steve Harrington and the fact that he mothers and babysits the whole gang, but he needs them as much as they need him makes me grin like a psychopath) So I have a lot of ideas and theories on where Ms. Stiefvater is planning on taking this story, some of them are realistic. Most of them are so absurd, you would look at me like I was batshit crazy (even more so than I usually am) if I post them here. I also am an avid Tumblr user (especially when I search up art and book related stuffs), so going through some of the beautiful fanart really makes me want to consume this series for breakfast and just sit there looking at my self knowing that I have a problem, but being okay with it.

I love her family, all of the banter between them, the sweetness between Blue and her mom - just everything! I feel bad that Blue has to go through all of these emotions with Adam and Gansey. Blue knows that she loves Gansey and that finally comes to light but in a very sad way :-( She knows she can't kiss him because she will kill him, that is her curse. But..OMG.. sweet Noah let her kiss him because he can't be killed. It was a bittersweet moment because she felt like that was the only kiss she would ever be able to give to anyone. Blue is a raven girl in my mind. Ronan and his sweet little raven, Chainsaw... I love them both. Ronan makes out to be this really tough guy and he is in many ways, but he is human. He has a human side that does so many wonderful things for people. Brings a damn tear to my eye. He is also a Greywaren, he can bring things out of dreams. Unfortunately, he brings some nasty things out of his dreams by accident and almost gets him and a few others killed. He's not the only one, but I'm not saying who all have this ability. I thought I fell down the rabbit hole again until I finally caught on :-) Adam is going through some tough stuff. He's not doing too well since he sacrificed himself for the leyline. It all works out in the end, thank goodness, when he gets some help from one of Blue's many family members. Adam had a sad life, growing up with a horrible father that beat him, having to working three jobs just to have the money to live on his own and go to the school with the other boys. He wouldn't take any charity from his friends and it made them sad and angry at times. But, they did find ways to help him without his knowledge... well he found out some things. But that's what friends do damn it! The reason I'm making this point is that he never asked for help until he went to Blue's home and that probably saved his life and we find out something he is now :-) There is also a dude that calls himself \"Grey Man\" He is a hitman and he gets a little something going with Blue's mom. He is there to do harm to someone in the group but then he just can't. There is something really bad he did in the past and I thought it was so sad for the person when they find out. Beyond all of the sad things that happen, there are many more good things. And the end, the epilogue, I was like what? I wonder how many more people are going to turn out to be other things......Well, I forgot to add my excerpts and when I looked at my page numbers I wrote down, they didn't have what I wanted to add.

Though I really enjoyed the writing in the first book, it completely blew me away here. The words were all perfectly chosen to craft simply beautiful and engrossing sentences. I don\u2019t have a way to describe it and the last time I tried:(She doesn\u2019t understand my feelings, apparently.)Here\u2019s my thing: These characters are fantastic, and the writing is smart. We\u2019re not explicitly told characters motivations or how their backstory effects their personality, but it\u2019s all handled so subtly we know. I often preach about showing vs telling, and this book nails it.I\u2019m still confused about aspects of this plot (because it\u2019s crazy and super interesting) but this series is so intensely character driven.

I have heard a lot of great things about Ronan Lynch and I finally understood why this character is really beloved by every reader I know. Almost the entirety of the book focused around Ronan\u2019s past, abilities, inner thoughts, feelings and relationships with his family and all the main characters of the book. Ronan truly shines in this book, there\u2019s no part in the book where the story isn\u2019t interesting (sometimes funny) when the narrative has him as the main POV. Picture: Ronan Lynch by Cassandra JeanAfter reading about the horrible and choppy dream sequences in Mark Lawrence\u2019s Broken Empire trilogy, I was afraid and petrified when I find out that there will be a lot of those dream sequences in this book. Turns out I was completely wrong. Every dream sequences give Ronan more necessary spotlight for his character and yes, this also means his development here is definitely the best one out of all the character in the series so far. Do remember though that I\u2019m only halfway through the series though so there\u2019s still plenty of room for all other character to shine even more.Although the focus of the book is mostly on Ronan, this doesn\u2019t mean that the other character doesn\u2019t shine. There is a glimpse of vivid emotions in every characters thoughts and actions, Gansey and Adam relationship here in particular took an intriguing and complex turn which imo is also one of the best part of the book other than Ronan. I\u2019m not kidding, I love reading every aspect of Gansey\u2019s and Adam\u2019s friendship because of how realistic and how well written their inner desire and feelings are.\n\u201cYou really didn't see the sadness or the longing unless you already knew it was there. But that was the trick, wasn't it? Everyone had their disappointment and their baggage; only, some people carried it in their inside pockets and not on their backs.\u201d \nNoah also, while appearing only a few times always shines and can we talk about Kavinsky? I seriously thought this guy was going to be a complete Malfoy annoying type of guy but as it turns out, he\u2019s an awesome character despite his brief appearances here. Plus, Kavinsky did an Easter Egg on Fight Club, one of my favorite movie adaptation of all time so that\u2019s a plus for me. Look, whether you love or hate these characters, there\u2019s no doubt that every main characters here are well written, that\u2019s all I have left to say on the characters here.Maggie\u2019s prose remains lyrical and beautiful but there is one thing to take note outside her prose, which is her passion for auto-mobile. Seriously, her love for cars can truly be seen from her writing and intricate description on every single race and cars description such as their brands, engines, wheels etc. Not only that, Gansey, Ronan and Kavinsky themselves all have this passion for cars which show Maggie\u2019s love on the topic even more and hey, anything done with a passion will always be a plus for me.Picture: Kavinsky\u2019s car by Telltale CrumbsFrom what I wrote so far, almost everything sounded like this book will at least be a 4 star but again, sadly I can\u2019t do that for these reason:First, as great as the characterization is, it shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice the main plot progression completely. The main plot, the hunt for the sleeping/dead Welsh king, Owen Glendower (a nice touch on historical aspect btw) have close to zero progression which make this book almost seems like a filler to the main series. Second, dunno if you realized this or not, I haven\u2019t talked about Blue. This is solely due to the reason that her role here is very minor that at times I had to remember \u201cwait, where's Eiffel 65?\u201d (Look up the song 'I'm Blue' if you\u2019re too young to ever know about this song) and it bothered me a bit cause I thought she was supposed to be the main character. The only time where she made a notable appearance here is the one where she spent her time with Noah, which was really well written and amusing to read.Third, insta-love between two characters (one being a completely new character in this installment) that were completely pointless and I seriously have no idea why I have to read their relationship progression like that.Finally, this is my adult fantasy attitude and longing being nitpicky here, the buildup to the climax were so well written but the conclusion of it was in my opinion very underwhelming.These 4 problems I had are all minor cons but they\u2019re the reason why I can\u2019t give this book a 4 star despite how much I enjoyed reading all the character interaction and progression. I gave this book the same rating with 'Six of Crows' and my overall experience of it is that I enjoyed it even more than the first book. I finished it in 2 days. It was magical, filled with great character development, magical and as usual, atmospheric. A good sequel I enjoyed and I hope the next book will be even better.This review is also featured on Booksprens where I'll be a guest reviewer for this series, check it out! :)You can find the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at BookNest"}, {"userName": "\u2744\ufe0fNani\u2744\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68538597-nani", "userReview": "Excuse me for a moment while I go slap myself senseless for having resisted this long.

Judge me not\u2026\u2728 Plot:After the events of The Raven Boys, all the mysteries that were left unanswered and the consequences of the things that happened, my head was kind of spinning with theories as to how this book would address those questions (or at the very least, some of them) and give some clarification or explanation. However, TDT took a completely different direction than I'd anticipated and I have to say, I might be one of the few ones who is actually pleased with that.The pace of this book is very slow, probably even slower than The Raven Boys and the build-up to the climax was somewhat lacking as it wasn\u2019t as intense as I\u2019d hoped. Wait, not so fast because the slow pace really worked for me here (and this is coming from the world's most impatient reader) but I was genuinely glued to the pages from start to finish and loved it far more than I did the first one. There was something oddly luring and eerie about this book that I couldn't, for the life of me, pry myself away from. And to be quite frank, as much as I was intrigued by the plot of the first book, I mainly enjoyed it for the characters and not exactly the mystery elements of the story which also turned out to be the same case with The Dream Thieves.The story here takes the focus away from the Glendower storyline and instead focuses more on Ronan (Ronan\ud83d\ude0d) and his ability to bring things back from dreams. So, where plots are concerned, it wasn't the most action-packed nor did it make any developments to the series, which almost felt like a side story with some links to the overall story arc of The Raven Cycle but the character developments and the beautiful writing more than made up for it. \u2728 Writing:What stood out for me above all else was the poetic yet potent writing style which instantly grabbed me and left me with a perpetual grin through the end. MS immerses her readers by creating such an effective hook with vivid descriptions that I could easily visualize the story\u2019s setting simply by reading the words.Moreover, the character interactions were fantastic. The dialogue between the casts flowed so well all the way through displaying their distinct personalities and somewhat eerie humour ever so beautifully, which in my pinion, was one the high points of this book. \u2728 Characters:Ronan:First off, Ronan\u2019s character = perfection. I love characters that make my head spin with intrigue and Ronan did that from start to finish. He is multi-layered, unpredictable and had such an incredible level of depth with so many different facets of his personality depending on who he was interacting with. And though a bit haphazard in its execution, his story was the one most thoroughly explored and consequently the best.I found everything about him fascinating and somewhat relatable (minus the taking things out of your dreams part) and I hope he doesn\u2019t take a back seat in the upcoming books because I'm not sure if I\u2019ll be able to enjoy the books as much as I did here without Ronan being an integral part of whatever's to come.I loved the rest of the characters as much as I did in the first one, if not more. And I stand by my word when I say they are the stand out aspect of this series (or the two that I've only read) and really filled in the large gaps in the book where there wasn\u2019t much going on.\u00a0However, and do forgive my contradictions here but that's not to say I didn\u2019t have some criticisms.Blue:Here\u2019s the thing about Blue, I like her and especially lately where I've seriously come to lose my already thinning patience with the painfully infuriating YA heroines that I keep reading about, Blue's character pales in comparison to any of those blockheads.However, her very little presence in the book makes it hard to talk about her when in fact, I'm struggling to remember any memorable moments with her in it, aside from that one single, albeit endearing scene with Noah.It feels like her individualism is lost and she\u2019s constantly struggling not to fade into oblivion but doesn\u2019t succeed. Her actions are based almost solely on what the boys are doing as she spends much of her time tagging along on their quest and not much else.The remainder of her appearances is spent on the continued formation of the love triangle and her confusing shifts in feeling towards Adam or Gansey (or both) which felt somewhat organic in the first book but a bit more contrived here. Gansey, though I do love him, not only does he play less part in the book, he is also, in all senses of the word, the typical hero of the series that we\u2019ve seen and continue to see time and time again. He\u2019s the protector, the loyal friend, the one they all look to for decisions and of course, the one the girl falls in love with\u2026 so on and so forth so, I\u2019ll hold off on any concrete judgment until I've completed the entire series and get a better insight into him.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Resistance is futile. I totally and completely give in. Let\u2019s do this thing! About damn time anyway.I daresay I\u2019m... what is that excitement, I feel?

Something new for every night.\u201dWell, obviously, Maggie Stiefvater can do amazing things with words. Beautiful things like this series. I was transfixed with The Dream Thieves. It's another fascinating novel made by a brilliant author.Some things still irritate me though. My best example: Ronan Lynch. Sometimes I just want to punch him in the face, especially when he behaves like the biggest dipshit earth has ever seen. His actions and words make me furious. Maybe it's his recklessness or his attitude, but often he doesn't make sense to me at all.Other times I want to punch Adam in the face for being so stubborn. Him though, I do understand. I just wish he'd swallow his pride and accept his friend's aid.Anyway, what bothers me most is that sometimes I just didn't understand a single word. I totally missed the meaning of what Maggie wanted to tell me. There was a whole chapter where I just sat still and thought \"???\". I guess that calls for a reread. I wish there was a little (or a lot) more clarity, it gets extremely confusing at some point. (It's hard to explain why exactly I was confused. It usually happens when authors work foreshadowing or go on another (metaphorical/spiritual/fatal) level of writing. When their words get so cryptic and mysterious that I lose them.)The only thing left to say is that Maggie created such raw and pure characters, that I don't want to let go of them.

Like I can't remember the exact context of this bizarre dream but I can recollect scattered images and emotions. Bliss. Anger. Agony. Pain.Love. For this series and its raw, complicated and real characters.\n\n \u201cIt was mint and memories and the past and the future and she felt as if she\u2019d done this before and already she longed to do it again.\u201d \n\nThe Dream Thieves is more focused on Ronan's history, his past, his secrets and his terrifying ability of pulling things out of his dreams. At the same time, Adam struggles to come to terms with the sacrifice he made, Gansey continues his relentless search of the long dead Welsh king and Blue realizes that heart is a traitorous thing and you can't choose who you fall in love with. When a mysterious man appears and stranger paranormal activity strikes their little town, Blue and her raven boys must solve the riddles of their abilities and the ley lines and discover what they're looking for before it is too late. Before someone else does.\n\n\u201cAll of us have secrets in our lives. We\u2019re keepers or keptfrom, players or played. Secrets and cockroaches \u2014 that\u2019s what will be left at the end of it all.\u201d\n\nI loved The Dream Thieves, but not as much as The Raven Boys. I was overwhelmed with a constant restlessness, I almost skipped sentences and pages because I wanted something more, something else to happen but I can't pinpoint what that was. Perhaps I got tired from the frequent switch between dreams and reality, and I ended up a tad unsatisfied.\n\n\u201cIn that moment, Blue was a little in love with all of them. Their magic. Their quest. Their awfulness and strangeness. Her raven boys.\u201d \n\nDespite this uneasy feeling though, Maggie Stiefvater's writing didn't lose its mystical and seductive touch. This book's greatest asset was that it explored more thoroughly the relationships between the characters and their personalities, their inner battles and desires and needs. It explained Ronan's hatred against the world, it uncovered the secrets he safeguarded for so long and I fell for his wounded, more vulnerable side. Adam on the contrary became more unpredictable. I can't shake the notion that he is jealous of Gansey and that's the source of his bitterness. He is changing, I can see that he's changing and I hope that he'll understand how awful he has been to Gansey who only wanted to help him. My sweet, dear Gansey, whose wilder, boyish side is equally intriguing with his scholarly one.\n\n\u201cI wish you could be kissed, Jane,' he said. 'Because I would beg just one off you.

But their connection, their stolen moments, the longing, they made my toes curl and my heart beat rapidly, sending warmth to every single cell of my body. I am scared and excited at the same time, but I hope, hope, hope.\n\n\u201cRex corvus. Parate regis corvi.\u201d \n\nThe Raven Cycle is a bewitching tale, and I'm off to start Blue Lily, Lily Blue, because staying away from Blue and her raven boys is impossible.

The plot is captivating, the characters alluring... I couldn't have asked for more from this book. With The Raven Boys (book1) and The Dream Thieves, you don't just get a little bit of character development and setting in the beginning and then have the rest of the story be all about the plot. You're constantly getting descriptions. And not in the 'I'm bored to tears' kind of way. More in the 'why am I not in this book and a character in this story' kind of way. All the details pull you further and further into the book.  \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cfAs for character development, that's another constant in the story. It's not like the characters were only developed in book 1 and then that's it, you're stuck with the same character for the rest of the series. Just like we develop everyday, so do the characters. You learn more and more about them and it really makes you feel like you're a part of the story. Blue Sargent (a.k.a. Jane) In that moment, Blue was a little in love with them all. Their magic. Their quest. Their awfulness and strangeness. Her raven boys. Blue is the only one in her family without psychic abilities, instead she's an amplifier, making other people's abilities stronger. Every psychic she's been to has told her that if she kisses her true love, he will die. And since she saw him on St. Mark's Eve, he's already destined to die that year. I love Blue's sense of humor, charm... pretty much everything. She never annoys me or has me pulling my hair out of frustration. If I could choose favorites... I'd maybe say it was her...?... but all the characters introduced are amazing so it's hard to choose. That includes the 'villains' of the story too, even if it's just to admire how realistic their character was!Richard Gansey III \u201cWhile I\u2019m gone,\u201d Gansey said, pausing, \u201cdream me the world. Something new for ever night.\u201d I love all the layers there were to Gansey. You have the rich, confident, untouchable side. And then you have to unsure, intelligent, scholar side... the side that will stop at nothing to find Glendower.  Boy. Scimus quid quaeritis.(Boy. We know what you\u2019re looking for.)Though the trees could have meant any of the boys, Gansey felt as if the words were directly particularly at him. Out loud, he said, \u201cWhat am I looking for?\u201d\u201cThey said there\u2019ve always been rumors of a king buried somewhere along this spirit road,\u201d Ronan said. His eyes held Gansey\u2019s.\u201cThey think he may be yours.\u201dBut more than anything, he's loyal. Ronan Lynch \u201c\u2026 no one but Ronan knew the terrors that lived in his mind.\u201d Ronan... he's another layer-filled character. I didn't know how to feel about him when reading The Raven Boys but we learn more about him in book 2, much more. He's still dangerous, damaged and aloof, but he's also caring. Just not in a way that is noticeable unless you see things from his eyes.  Adam Parrish \u201cWhat do you want, Adam?\u201d\u201cTo feel awake when my eyes are open.\u201dAdam broke my heart. Almost more than Ronan did. He's been trying to make something for himself. Always trying to do it on his own\u2013 make his own money, pay his own bills, without any help. But he sacrificed himself, to be Cabeswater's eyes and ears... and that comes with a price. Noah Czerny\u201cWas he really here, or was it a dream? Did it make a difference to Cabeswater?\u201d Noah's probably the one I know least about. Probably because I didn't get much from his perspective. But from what I do know, I can say he's a great character. Almost like the glue the keeps Ronan, Adam, and Gansey together. Joseph Kavinsky \u201cThe world\u2019s a nightmare.\u201dKavinsky was a mystery to me for most of the book. He and Ronan were so alike... but so different. Especially near the end.

We\u2019re keepers or kept-from, players or played. Secrets and cockroaches \u2014 that\u2019s what will be left at the end of it all.\nBlurb: If you could steal things from dreams, what would you take?Ronan Lynch has secrets. Some he keeps from others. Some he keeps from himself.One secret: Ronan can bring things out of his dreams.And sometimes he's not the only one who wants those things.Ronan is one of the raven boys - a group of friends, practically brothers, searching for a dead king named Glendower, who they think is hidden somewhere in the hills by their elite private school, Aglionby Academy. The path to Glendower has long lived as an undercurrent beneath town. But now, like Ronan's secrets, it is beginning to rise to the surface - changing everything in its wake.Weird af brilliant book. That\u2019s all I can say.I have such an odd relationship with this series. When I first pick up a book (it happened with both TRB and TDT), I put it away. Maybe I feel it\u2019s too slow or I won\u2019t really care about the new characters but I always end up reading it and loving the shit out of it.I\u2019m still surprised of how much I care and how much I like almost all the characters. That by itself is a rarity but when you combine likeable characters with actually great characterization, good development and a compelling story, well, you have the keys to success.I can\u2019t say I liked this one better than the first one, maybe I liked it a tiny bit less but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t love it.So, this second book is mostly about Ronan and Adam. We get to know more about how he takes stuff out of his dreams, the complications of it, the risks and how Ronan Lynch\u2019s head works. There\u2019s desperation, angry, regrets, secrets and content. In my TRB review I said Ronan was one of my favorite characters and, after this book, he is probably one of my favorites ever. There are so many layers and so many aspect of his persona but, somehow, he still manages to be quite simple.I got really fucking frustrated with his relationship with Kavisnky but that could be because I absolutely hated Joseph Kavinsky. That little shit was just too much for me and I feel it was also Ronan\u2019s mirror. Like, that could\u2019ve been him if he didn\u2019t have Gansey and the others so I both hated and enjoyed all the scenes where Kavinsky was in. And I rather enjoyed Kavinsky\u2019s innuendos. Boy, it was so obvious he was into Ronan.There were two particular scenes that made me think (before shit went south) that the only thing Kavinsky wanted was someone to be with.\n With a theatric twist of his hand, he presented his dream object. A pen cap. He twitched his fingers until Ronan handed over the dream-pen.The cap, of course, fit perfectly.\nThat was the first time I thought he wanted someone to complete him. Maybe I am reading too much between lines but I don\u2019t think so. As the story goes, well, everything falls into place.But there was also this one:\n After a moment, he heard the hood groan as Kavinsky leaned over him. Then he felt the ridged callus of a finger drag slowly over the skin on his back. A slow arc between his shoulder blades, drawing the pattern of his tattoo. Then sliding down his spine, tensing every muscle it moved over.\nThere was nothing subtle about the way Kavinsky wanted Ronan and nothing subtle about Ronan\u2019s response, or lack of it.I toyed with the idea of Kavinsky getting better but it was a no-go. He wanted to own and be owned by Ronan. He wouldn\u2019t share him but, as much I didn\u2019t like him, I do appreciate his whole role.Now, Ronan\u2019s relationship with his brothers is so tricky I still don\u2019t know how to feel.He loves Matthew, that\u2019s a sure thing and he hates Declan but I don\u2019t know how much he hates him. Does he hate him enough to kill him one day if it comes to it? Does he hate him enough to stop caring if something happens to him? He was clearly disturbed by Declan being all bruised and he also included him in the will. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t know. I know it\u2019ll come a time where Declan\u2019s going to be more involved and I just hope Ronan doesn\u2019t regret his decisions towards his older brother. Whether they\u2019re good or bad.\n Everyone at St. Agnes knew the Lynch brothers didn\u2019t come to church alone.\nNow, let\u2019s talk about Adam.I don\u2019t know if I love him or hate him. Well, hate is such a strong word but maybe frustration? Yes! I\u2019m frustrated! Look, I like Adam more than I used to but I still can\u2019t wrap my heart around him. Gosh, I wanna love that guy, I do. I feel like loving Adam Parrish could be so good but he needs to stop directing his anger toward the wrong people. Granted, he doesn\u2019t have many people in his life to decide on whom he\u2019ll be angry at but come on, boy, just stop.He needs to level up, to own himself so he can take down the world or something. Adam\u2019s right when it comes to his value: he can do anything he wants but he also has to stop for a second and breathe.He has his demons to battle but he\u2019s not alone. Contrary of the way he sees it, he\u2019s not alone and he will never be alone again. Even if they all part ways (seriously, though, can you imagine them going on different ways?) he will never be alone. Adam wants, needs, Glendower so badly he can blind himself in the process. But with that been said, I found myself liking this Adam a lot more. He has some clarity that TRB Adam didn\u2019t have and a brand new sense of resolution. \n It was nothing, but it was Adam Parrish\u2019s nothing. How he hated and loved it. How proud he was of it, how wretched it was.\nI love he\u2019s proud and he wants to do things on his own, it\u2019s what he needs after all that\u2019s happened to him but he still needs to find a way to be proud but also be proud of having friends that would help him and actually accept their help.I also liked how he wanted answers from Blue, that was so not the way to get them, though, but I liked that. He did deserve more and he did deserve to know what was on the table. I have big hope for Adam but there\u2019s something bothering me. Or maybe not bother but rather confusing the heck outta me. Calla called Ronan Magician but then Adam\u2019s reading showed he was the magician and Persephone also named him that. What\u2019s the truth? Did Calla just call Ronan Magician because Adam\u2019s his fate? After all, Ronan\u2019s the Greywaren. I\u2019m so digging Adam and Ronan together.Now, the Gray Man. What the actual fuck with the guy?At first I thought he was the villain but then he was like not really that but rather a neutral agent and then he was not so neutral after all and then what?I was trying my hardest not to care about him because, after he decide he wasn\u2019t going to take Ronan, I was so sure he was going to be killed I didn\u2019t want to invest my feelings on an already dead character.I also played with the idea of him being Blue\u2019s father but nope. Maura would\u2019ve known him immediately but I still liked him. He was more complex than I thought he was going to be. And though I liked him enough, I can\u2019t still make a solid idea of him. He was afraid of his brother, yet he killed him like he was not the threat I thought he was going to be. Calla actually liked him, Calla fucking liked him. And his relationship with Maura was so cute, geez. \n The Gray Man thought of Maura\u2019s smile again. And he thought of the fuss and noise of 300 Fox Way, of Blue\u2019s bright banter, of the tuna fish sandwich at the deli counter, the haunted blue mountains calling him home.He wanted to stay.\nThose were, to me, the main characters of this book but I\u2019d like to discuss very quickly the rest of the characters.I absolutely adored that we saw more of the women who live in 300 Fox Way. Maura, Calla, Persephone and Orla are just so unbelievable amazing. There\u2019s nothing bad I can say about them and I\u2019m more curious. Was Persephone the previous Magician? Are they going to find Blue\u2019s father? I feel like something will happen to Calla and I can\u2019t quite out my finger on it. I\u2019m worried and excited with get to see more of them in the following books.There wasn\u2019t much of Blue in this book but I loved her. She was so cool and strong and she asked for more. Blue Sargent is one of the most interesting characters out there and though this wasn\u2019t all about her, I\u2019m dying to see how things will be next for her. Her relationship with her mother is so unique and so right. The more I read about them, the more I love them. And now she actually acknowledged her feelings for Gansey and what she doesn\u2019t feel about Adam, things are bound to be different.\n she very much liked the idea of it \u2014Blue Sargent, desperado; Blue Sargent, superhero; Blue Sargent, badass.\n Now, Gansey. Boy, there are a lot of things going one with him. I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to appear the feeling of being the only one who\u2019s not special. Like, he\u2019s incredibly good at things, he\u2019s a natural leader and he was the one who brought them all together and he\u2019s a very peculiar and unique person on his own but he\u2019s with a guy who can take things from his dreams, a ghost, a living magic increaser and a magician. I\u2019m waiting for it, for the feeling of being left aside because I feel it\u2019s going to happen eventually. Gansey\u2019s keeping a lot of things in his heart and head, it\u2019s going to explode someday.He\u2019s also acknowledged his feelings for Blue, he feels guilty about them, he\u2019s worried as fuck about Adam and he\u2019s also relieved Ronan\u2019s better but he\u2019s running out of time. Like, he\u2019s going to die and he doesn\u2019t know it yet and it\u2019s killing me and Blue and I\u2019m scared. Now, I missed Noah. A lot. I didn\u2019t know I was going to miss him this much until he disappeared. I hope now Cabeswater is back and magic can be restored, he can also be back because damn, I miss him. He\u2019s the glue, whether they know it or not, he\u2019s the glue of the group and he and Blue are so cool together I may cry.\n \u201cI\u2019d ask you out, if I was alive.\u201dNothing was fair.\u201cI\u2019d say okay,\u201d she replied.\nLike I said, I don\u2019t know if this one\u2019s better than the first one. I was more frustrated in this book, that much I can say. I loved the new characters and how the old ones were explored and what about that ending? When did Maura go to Cabeswater? Is she in there? She could be in that cavern where the river was.The Raven King, make way for the Raven King. Gansey?There are a lot of things that can happen in the next book and I\u2019m so excited to read it."}, {"userName": "\u1d0a\u1d07ss ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40929181-ss", "userReview": "In that moment, Blue was a little in love with all of them. Their magic. Their quest, Their awfulness and strangeness. Her raven boysThis book was something out of a dream. Reading this felt like developing a crush. When you just look at something/someone and it just feels right. And as time goes on, you continue to love that person more and more. Falling in love with their nervous mannerisms and they way they speak. Reading this was like continuously falling in love with someone, deeper and deeper. And oh man, am I ever falling in love with this story.I can never express my love enough for these characters. There's something so profound and real about them, that it's almost overwhelming. It's like....I need them to be real. Because they already feel so alive in my mind. Gansey - He is such a nerd. I love him to death. I know I've already gushed about these characters, but reading this book felt like knowing them all over again. Gansey is something so rare and strange and giddy. He can be a little child one minute and the next, a cool, calm adult. Reading from his POV, felt like knowing some sort of a secret because you finally know what he's really thinking and not just seeing his shiny exterior. He reminds me soft butter, and freckles, and warm hands. Honestly, what an awkward lovely weirdo he is.Blue - Ugh, this girl is a tiny, raging feminist and I am completely in love with it. Not only does she warm my heart with every clever word she speaks, but she makes me feel like dressing in old band tees and crocheting myself some leggings. I adore her friendship with Noah. It has to be one of the most pure things in the entire book and it makes me feel sleepy and warm and nostalgic for when I was a kid when everything was soft laughter and warm hugs. Also Blue's relationship with her mom and her relatives just makes me feel so soft and happy. I love her family so much.Ronan - Ronan is like a toasted marshmallow. On the outside, he's a little bit tough but when you get through that, he's really just a mushy emotional mess. Everything he does is done so impulsively, not really thinking about what'll happen next, and boy can I relate. Reading about him made me want to be reckless and shave my head and have the best sense of humor in the world. Also, the way he was so so protective of Matthew(the cutest little cupcake in the entire universe)made me super duper happy. I love his relationship with him and I love Matthew so much that sometimes it physically hurts. There's something about Ronan, that when he feels something, you feel it too. My insides are crying for this boy.Adam - Ah Adam, our troubled, troubled young man. Reading about Adam was like sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool where everything is softer and floaty and less often. Everything felt almost like a blur with him. I just felt everything so much when reading from his POV. And I love him with every fiber of my being but sometimes he almost frustrated me. He never accepts help from people. And while I perfectly understand why (and the reasons make me cry in 72 different languages), I've also realized that sometimes accepting help doesn't mean you're weak. It just means that you know yourself well enough to understand that sometimes you can't do everything alone. Anyway, I cry for Adam Parrish several times in a hour and I will protect him with every piece of my heart.Noah - There is no one in this series that makes me feel more child-like and sad-happy than Noah. Every time I think of him, my mind automatically jumps to the word hufflepuff. He's fluffy and kind and just everything I think a hufflepuff is and I adore him with all my soul. Even though I understand why he doesn't get much page-time, I still wish he would be in the book more. This book makes me feel exciting and strange and mysterious, like I could find an adventure right where I am. Also it is intriguing as frick?? All those different POVs, I think, really kept me guessing and wanting more. And even though the 1st book is lovely and amazing, there's just....ugh I don't know, something about The Dream Thieves that makes me want to die and become resurrected in Henrietta, Virginia. ( Also if Adam and Ronan do not end up together at the end of this, I will feel personally attacked by Maggie and will indeed fite someone)Anyways, this book is a summertime thunderstorm where everything is dark green and gray and wild and you feel like you could fly away. And I am crushing on it and you should be too."}], "description": "The second installment in the all-new series from the masterful, #1 NEW YORK TIMES bestselling author Maggie Stiefvater!Now that the ley lines around Cabeswater have been woken, nothing for Ronan, Gansey, Blue, and Adam will be the same.
