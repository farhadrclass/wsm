In love with it ever since I first read it."}, {"userName": "Henry", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74506201-henry", "userReview": "I read this book for the Leaving Cert and without a doubt, it's probably one of the worst things I've ever read. I have a personal vendetta against this book. I hate it. I have in-jokes with my friends about Death and Nightingales making fun of it. It's so bad. My teacher however, adored it, and thought Eugene McCabe was one of the best Irish writers ever, and this was one of the best Irish novels ever. If that's that case and this is one of his best works, I think my pre-teen sister is going to be the next James Joyce. She writes stories about pineapples, check her out.My main issue is the characters and pacing of the novel, McCabe doesn't seem to have much idea of how to create interesting characters, you never see inside the heads of the characters, and therefore it's quite hard to really care about any of them. None of the characters are very likeable in my opinion, even the protagonist. Beth's problem of being pregnant outside marriage is... very common in historical fiction and barely elaborated on whatsoever, fundamentally her motivations are selfish, and her trust in Liam Ward (who's possibly the most obtusely foreshadowed villain I've ever seen, seriously McCabe, learn to foreshadow subtly) is absolutely baffling. The novel tries to present her as cunning and intelligent but at the climax of the novel she acts like more of a horror movie dumb blonde, except she's the stereotypical Irish redhead. My other big issue with the climax of the novel is a really petty one but it's important to me, as a fashion history buff.Beth Winters, who lives in the year 1883, and is a relatively wealthy woman, yet somehow, in the space of probably under thirty seconds removes her ENTIRE OUTFIT down to her underwear.Just to get the VISIBLE elements of the outfit out of the way. In the 1880s, bustle skirts with \"apron\" skirts were fashionable. These were tied on separately to the actual main skirt. The skirt and bodice were separate pieces, and bodices usually had a lot of very small buttons, also they were generally fairly tight at the time. Then comes a corset cover (depending on the outfit, but they weren't uncommon), at least one petticoat, a bustle, which is to be fair, relatively easy to untie, but could be bulky and the big thing, a corset.McCabe either implies that Beth goes entirely without a corset (which was worn by pretty much every woman at the time, it was the pre-20th century equivalent of a bra and most clothes outside bedclothes couldn't be worn without them, and she was travelling so it wouldn't make sense for her not to wear one), that Beth rips off her corset in SECONDS (which is flat out impossible unless she's built like the hulk, and would be very painful, or that she swims around and \"arches her back\" in a corset. simply BENDING in corsets could be awkward and uncomfortable, and yet Beth Winters is capable of doing gymnastics and swimming in them. The historical accuracy in general isn't amazing, Percy French wasn't actually very popular at the time (it was the late 1880s when he became prolific), yet there's an ENTIRE CHAPTER dedicated to a popular Percy French Concert, the lack of research irks me honestly, because this is information that can be found practically anywhere. It's on the Wikipedia page. This novel was presumably written in the late 80s to early 90s, but libraries definitely existed at the time, there's really no excuse.Then there's Billy, who's just abhorrent and is confirmed to regularly sexually abuse Beth, but apparently it's okay because she's not TECHNICALLY his daughter and he's nice when he DOESN'T drink heavily (which he always does). His \"guilt\" seems performative and he seems to consistently pretend he did nothing to Beth and that she should forgive him for his actions.The ending of the novel is bizarre, lazy, and pretty creepy to say the least. After assaulting his daughter with a whip and beating her to a pulp, Billy asks Beth for his hand in marriage. Apparently this is symbolic, but given how little led up to this moment, and how Billy really did nothing to even ATTEMPT to reconcile with Beth, who has every right to not forgive him and maybe finish him off too, since he did sexually assault her multiple times, yet inexplicably asks for her hand in marriage, this being the end of the novel. This may be supposed to be symbolic of unionists and nationalists reconciling but it's so bizarre, lazily written, and ham-fisted that it's more puzzling than anything. If you wanted to use that symbolism, it would have been much, much easier to do something else to show reconciliation, or actually foreshadow it so that it makes even the slightest bit of sense.(But then again, the author seems to want to make Billy seem sympathetic, so I don't know. I certainly don't sympathize with him).In general, the novel's writing is quite dry, there's very little emotion put into it, most scientific theses have more emotion in them than this. Again, I feel that the problem stems from McCabe's inability to get into the heads of his characters, he focuses on the external rather than the internal. One thing about this novel that I believe was done well was the imagery, you really do get a sense of the setting of the story and atmosphere and I appreciate that, however the plot and the characters still suffer, and that's the only thing that I can really applaud. Also as a note most characters barely got any physical description, which I felt somewhat odd given the detail in the imagery of Fermanagh, making it difficult to picture them.The pacing of the story was absolutely horrendous, I feel the plot could have been condensed into a much shorter novel and made much more interesting. There were whole CHAPTERS of completely unnecessary scenes, like farm workers finding old butter in the ground, which advanced a grand total of nothing. The novel was generally extremely slow and the only reason I didn't stop reading was because my grades depended on my understanding of this book (at least we did Shakespeare instead of that as the single text though). It was nearly halfway through the book before the plot really emerged, before that there were just scenes and scenes and scenes of... I don't even know how to describe them. They just felt like stuff. Nothing really happened. The antagonist of the novel was met really late too, and before the reader even meets him they know he's bad news, because practically the only set up he's had is that he's not a good person and should be avoided and evicted, which doesn't make his villainy the least bit surprising. I honestly feel like this plot could have been done well if it was a novella instead of a full-length novel. Really, several chapters should have just been flat out removed from the final text. Despite not being very long, it feels like scenes last forever.In general, I just really didn't like the book, a lot of the issues explored in it weren't presented very well or explored properly in my opinion, especially since it involved very sensitive issues like alcoholism, sexual abuse, unhealthy relationships, and physical abuse. I'd advise against reading this if you have bad experiences with any of these, as they seem to be thrown in and not dealt with very well at all. A lot of people apparently enjoy this book, I don't know why, but if you can convince me of something actually read-worthy about this book, I'll applaud you. If it's just the imagery, I'd rather read poetry, it takes up less of my time."}, {"userName": "Padraic", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1135170-padraic", "userReview": "Having had my fill of Ulster novels recently, I came across this title by an Irish author previously unknown to me.Set in a time hopelessly prior to Bloody Sunday, McCabe's novel is beautifully structured, rhythmically perfect, and perfect in its rendition of the lush countryside of Fermanaugh. Elizabeth's character is deep, complex, and well worth the effort. Highly recommended. NJAIN.

It was a Christmas present from Mam. I had an idea that Eugene McCabe was a dark playwright but I think I was mixing him up with Pat McCabe. This might be his only novel but he has some short stories.There's a kind of unevenness in it, maybe? It opens with a very difficult and very impressive few pages, but then loosens up into something more smooth but a bit less forehead-slapping. Perhaps I just got used to his style.Interesting to get a story about both Protestant landowners and Catholic employees, without particular bias towards either, especially at this key historical time (Parnell making shapes, etc). The story is a traditional dramatic setpiece, there's a good air of mystery and darkness about the whole thing. It's very possible I'm missing some broader metaphor for land-ownership or political turmoil in 19th century Ireland but there's not much information about it online.Update: Whoa. Just found this thing where he tells that it's based, very largely, on a true story. Spoilers, of course. The whole thing is, apparently, a foreshadow of future political turmoil. Of course."}, {"userName": "Karina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5139030-karina", "userReview": "I've read this twice, and was blown away both times."}, {"userName": "Cian Morey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36231441-cian-morey", "userReview": "\"How extraordinarily beautiful the world could be and all the creatures in it, excepting mankind.\"For better or worse, I can see why this is on the Leaving Certificate course.\"Death and Nightingales\" is... well... um... well, it's a book, that much is for sure. The story unfolds over one day and one night in 1883, the birthday of Miss Beth Winters, which also happens to be the day upon which she has planned to elope with her lover. She hopes to escape great familial tensions, a house fraught with tragic memories, and a community that is steadily tearing itself apart. Also there are questions of religion, inheritance and pregnancy. And a little bit of murder.Generally, this book's main strength lies in its humanisation of characters. Eugene McCabe persuades us to empathise with characters both major and minor, good and evil. There are some particularly nice turns of dialogue which give us affecting insights into the mindsets of characters we may have presumed to hate at first; often I found my opinion of certain individuals varying back and forth across the ethical scale throughout the novel. One key character that McCabe seems to have neglected to humanise, however, is Beth Winters herself. It's kind of tricky then when this woman is apparently the protagonist, or at least the prime focus of the plot. Once the action picks up in the second half of the novel, one finds it somewhat difficult to care. My lasting memory of this book is the amount of potential it had. McCabe has picked an extraordinarily tumultuous time in Irish history. He sets up a number of ideas that could make for a very philosophically-charged work, but unfortunately he does little more than scratch the surface of each of them. One outstanding chapter - 11, I believe - features a controversial encounter with Percy French (a real, celebrated, Irish comic songwriter), but by the end we come to see that this chapter actually exists in isolation, while the direction the plot ultimately takes is not as interesting as what could have been. I recall Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn praising the book for \"prose of bleak, unadorned beauty\"; in fairness he nearly hit the nail on the head, if he was trying to convey how depressing and - even worse - dull, the style is. McCabe sparkles in dialogue. But that's sort of it.This book does seem like something to be studied by students. It is fairly straightforward prose-wise, and suitably confused theme-wise, so maybe that would make for a few interesting essays. It is unlikely to be something that one would read voluntarily, and if one does, it is unlikely to be rewarding. It's a good book. Nothing more to say, really."}, {"userName": "Vera Fernandez", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73373831-vera-fernandez", "userReview": "Dark and moody.

I know I missed some references (local and historical) but still enjoyed the book. There is a lot of build up to what you know will be a showdown between the main character (Beth) and Billy, her stepfather but I felt the payoff was a bit of a letdown to recommend it enthusiastically. The best scene is probably one that doesn't have anything to do with the main plot but describes a popular entertainer who comes to town to perform. It gave the town and people in it a broader more complex context and was entertaining to boot. A quick read but probably only for those who love Ireland and its traditions/history."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14630856-peter", "userReview": "\u201cI\u2019ll give you death and nightingales...you\u2019ll fly from here, forever, with rooks, daws and magpies, you\u2019ll croak like scald crows from now on...\u201dA powerful novel from Irish farmer and playwright Eugene McCabe. Death and Nightingales is a story of deception, betrayal, and false lovers that evokes, with echoes of Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight, the darkest of folk tales amongst the rural life and landscapes of County Fermanagh. Set in the days of Parnell and the Invincibles, the narrative and the tragedy are derived from growing tensions, and violence, between Protestant landowners and Catholic workers. The writing is atmospheric, the images memorable, and the characterization of a young woman driven to the point of madness is both chilling and oddly lyrical."}, {"userName": "Valerie Campbell Ackroyd", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12659115-valerie-campbell-ackroyd", "userReview": "I thought it would take forever for Beth's plans to emerge.
