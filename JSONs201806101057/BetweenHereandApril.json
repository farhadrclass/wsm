I really really disliked the main character, even more so as various revelations came out. She was passive and doing so many damaging things to herself, and not confronting her own truths. There were too many threads going on here, and not enough focus. We also learn that all men are evil workaholics with nasty tempers, and all women are depressive, neurotic and unappreciated. (Um, NO. You clearly need to get out more and meet some new people.) And it was a pretty unsatisfying ending too (so reading for plot didn't really pay off, I guess).

So the bad gets passed on along with the good . . . be it postpartum depression, lack of coping skills, garden-variety depression, marital tensions, or all of the above.Intense and shocking, yet uplifting, this book examines many of the aspects of parenthood that Just Aren't Talked About, and while it does so with delicacy and compassion, it does not avoid asking the hard questions. Ultimately about redemption, it is not an easy road to get there.A small complaint: The ending was good, but completely skipping over whatever resolution there must have been to several key plot points (such as specifics about their marital issues) was a mistake, in my opinion. They were clearly significant and seemed to be close to insoluble -- so what happened?"}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1193775-lisa", "userReview": "The plot was an interesting idea, and the way the main character eventually dealt with April's mystery was unexpected. But there were too many and mostly 2-dimensional characters. And worst of all, the resolution of the main character's life was shocking and appalling. Basically, the moral of her story seems to be \"settle for what you've got, even if it's an inattentive, irresponsible husband with an addiction to work and porn who expects you to live out his s-and-m fantasies even though they bring back terrible flashbacks of a gang rape.\" I don't think this character would have dealt with her marriage this way.

She embarks on a journey to find out what happened to the girl, April, and is forced to explore issues such as postpartum depression, patriarchal bias, and filicide. As she digs deeper into April's story, parallels to her own life and relationships, with her mother, her daughters and her husband, become clear. The result is a story that is both Elizabeth's, and April's, as well as April's mother, Adele's. At times, I found this depressing and hopeless, but it is just that emotional depth that elevates the writing from something voyeuristic to empathetic. I found myself meditating on my own relationship with my mother in comparison to April's and Elizabeth's. I would imagine if the reader is also a mother, she might find this book even more poignant. Parts of it made me wonder if it wasn't a true story with identifying characteristics changed to protect the innocent/guilty.

The protagonist, when haunted by a memory of an early childhood friend who disappeared from her life, starts investigating the 35-year old story. From the book jacket, \"Elizabeth's exploration thus leads her ultimately back to herself: her compromised marriage, her increasing self-doubt, her desire for more out of her career and her life, and finally to a fearsome reckoning with what it means to be a wife and mother.\"This book touches on so many issues - motherhood and stay-at home mothers, marriage, suicide, war, therapy, gender roles - in a very accurate way for many people. I am married (15 years) with 2 children - and could relate to so much of the narrative. The author writes beautifully - and quoted philosophers in such a way that I looked them up to learn more.A paragraph from a page I earmarked:(reflecting on the things we learn, study and imagine in school) \"For all the pledges of allegiance we gave to a pece of cloth, why didn't we ever discuss the implications of pledging allegiance to another person? Marriage is the one institution I know which doesn't require preparation for matriculation. There are no essays asking us to predict the number of children we will have, if any, and who will take them to the hospital if they bleed. There are no multiple-choice tests forcing us to envisage how our financial partnership might look, or late-night field trips to love's inner sanctums to witness sexual politics in action. There are no textbooks offering tips to what to do when the baby is sick, the sitter's on vacation, and both spouses are on deadline; no four-page syllabi containing his-and-her primary source material. In fact, the only primary source material we're given comes from the most unreliable of sources possible: our own parents. No wonder half of us flunk out.\" (p.62)and in reflecting on reporters (and, I think, on our life...): \"We do not report the truth. We report on what we see.\" - Emerson - \"there is no history, only biography.\" (p. 174)Again, I think it's a compelling, thought-provoking read.

Her marriage is crumbling, her career is in stuck in limbo, and she is haunted by the death of her childhood friend. As she uncovers the truth behind her friend's death, she discovers that she has a lot more in common with her friend's mother than she would care to admit. A woman who committed a horrific crime: taking the lives of her two children and her own. This story really resonates. As a society, we are so quick to judge people, their lives, and their decisions. However, what if we put ourselves in their shoes? How can we be okay picking apart other people's lives, but not try to help them? The author does a wonderful job making both women sympathetic, but not pathetic. I can totally understand where these women come from and why they made the decisions they did. Life is full of grey areas and full of difficult and heartwrenching decisions.

Even if it hurt.\",Regarding this review & my relative understanding of the book, I offer because of the other reviews I have read; 1) I am a male, a happily married (and I certainly believe my wife of 10 years feels the same) father of 2 beautiful girls, 2) my wife had severe postpartum depression after the first of our girls was born, & I knew nothing of the condition until that time 3) I seemed to experience some sort of depression related to the birth of our second daughter which lasted about 2 months (I do not claim to understand postpartum depression because of this experience). I mention each of these because I have seen several reviewers found this book disturbing, unrealistic, too realistic or too depressing (metaphorically speaking), but especially because it would seem to be a book read mostly by women, though I certainly don't recommend this only for women.I found this book to be an intriguing &, although sad & generally discomforting, all-too-true read. This book covers types of sadness & despression that real people experience every day. It deals with the tedium that can claim the life of parents, especially (in this case) stay-at-home moms; unfortunately, women face workforce bias, lower rates of pay than men in the same positions, judgement if they leave their children with sitters or nannies, or judgement if they stay home with their children.Life, as this book repeatedly points out, is not fair, nor is it always fun. It is a shame that the book is (from what I have seen in reviews) not so well received because of the apparent harshness of the story.The story, about a woman who, in experiencing her own depression, relates it to the loss of a childhood friend, who was killed by her mother in a murder-suicide, is both inspiring (wake up & help those around you) & dissappointing (why are fathers so easily villified, generally speaking, when a lot of us are doing our best to carry weight when we get home from work. A possible anwer; I just watched \"Mary Poppins\" with my daughter this morning and a line is appropriate here, the mother sings something like, \"although we love men individually, as a group we agree that they're rather stupid\"; all too true, unfortunately).The woman, Elizabeth, tells the story in first person, with the exception of the final chapter, where she is looking forward, which was an excellent literary tool to bring the story to a close.In researching the death of her friend for a documentary she wants to produce, Elizabeth begins to realize that the event had a major life-long effect on her. Digging deeper, she realizes how close she was to this sort of tragedy; maternal filicide. Elizabeth's mother had been tough to live with, apparently experiencing the same sort of things as the mother who killed her children & herself. Elizabeth begins searching for the truth, a truth that, she finds, does not exist. She fears that she may be facing the same difficulties herself & fears the same outcome.The author does an excellent job of presenting both past & present through the eyes of the narrator. The story is clear, well-written & intense. Though I certainly do not understand what it is to be a woman, the struggles of monthly cycles & associated mood swings, the hormones that are a physical part of being a woman or the connections, positive & negative, between mother & child. But I do understand the struggles of parenthod & marriage; anything worth having is worth working for (if you'll excuse the cliche) and I don't mean that as a judgement against folks who can't work it out. I most certainly do not understand the depths to which one would sink in order to kill themself and thier children. But I do understand what the author is writing, the skill with which she accomplished her portrayal of pain in life, & the excellent way in which she brought to the forefront the facts of our all too recent understanding of depression of all kinds, & the need for more intense study of the subject.Though this was certainly not a brighten-up-your-day read, it was definitely a good read & I would recommend it with warnings that it is a sad book, covering sad, disturbing & misunderstood concepts.I enjoyed reading this book, and I was able to look inside & take something away from it for my own life as husband & father, & I feel a better understanding of the concepts presented (even if not, obviously, a mastery of the topics)."}, {"userName": "momruncraft", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/862171-momruncraft", "userReview": "I am not sure why I was drawn to this book. Okay, I am sure. New book in a used book store. $2 price tag. And the fact that the name April was in the title didn't hurt. With words such as \"haunting page turner\" and \"riveting novel that will haunt you\" on the back synopsis, I dove in unsure of what to expect.Elizabeth Burns is the mother of two, a journalist, a wife, a daughter: a woman trying to successfully juggle and wear many different masks throughout the day. And she is having a hard time. She finds herself fainting out of the blue in random places. After her doctor recommends she seek the opinion of a mental health professional she uncovers memories of a long lost friend from second grade who disappeared completely one day. Her psychicatrist suggests maybe there is a connection between her friend's disappearance and her current problems. As memories of the last day she saw her friend April and the days following April's disppearance start to surface, Elizabeth dives into a lengthy investigation to find out the truth behind what really happened. And the investigation and answers turn her life upside down.A book that thoroughly illustrates what mothers probably experienced before the term \"postpartum depression\" was given relevance and medical standing. A book that fearlessly examines the everyday challenges and burdens faced by many women and the feelings and struggles of those who can barely manage. A book that tells a story that must be told and discussed. Motherhood is seen as a miracle, a time of supreme happiness and blessing. However, the reality is vastly different from the fantasy often held while pregnant. Sleepless nights, crazy hormones, less than helpful husbands, household responsibilities... it can be overwhelming. To speak poorly of new motherhood is seen as taboo. To say it's not what you expected is to be looked down on or to be seen as ungrateful. Fortunately, postpartum depressioin is now seen as a valid medical condition and treatments have been made readily available. Women are no longer turned away and told to take a nap and shower, or long walk outside.There is a passage in the book that I found to be incredibly poignant. It discusses the value and societal outlook of physical discomforts/ailments versus mental conditions and the various things people do to relieve such conditions. The visual aid of a physical impairment versus the invisible struggles of a mental illness. While a great deal about mental illness remains taboo and undiscussed, hopefully more novels such as these will bring to light the tragic consequences of silence. And ignorance.Overall, a good book; however, I feel the discussion sparked by the book is likely much more powerful and moving than the book itself."}, {"userName": "Florinda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/169984-florinda", "userReview": "I don't know if it's really news to anyone any more that motherhood isn't always sunshine and rainbows and butterflies - and I think we're lucky to be living in a time when that's more out in the open. It can be a struggle for many of us at times, and for some it's a challenge that may just be too much.Elizabeth Burns' viewing of a production of Medea triggers a memory of her childhood friend April Cassidy, who was rumored to have been killed by her own mother in a murder/suicide. Once it comes back to her, Elizabeth can't shake her thoughts of April, and her journalist background spurs her to dig into the story and try to find out what really happened. But it's not the what of the story that turns out to matter as much as the why. As Elizabeth learns more about April's mother Adele and her struggles with depression, she begins seeing some unsettling similarities to her own challenges in marriage and motherhood.I think this would be a great book for book clubs in general, but particularly for book groups mostly composed of moms, because it's both thought- and emotion-provoking, and I suspect the reactions of mothers might be particularly strong - although, since I am a mother, it's hard to say how my response to the book might have been different if I weren't. I have believed for a long time that my mother suffered from untreated, undiagnosed depression (which may have been a factor in her early-onset Alzheimer's), and it wasn't hard to be reminded of that in the character of Adele Cassidy. It also wasn't hard to identify with the sense of being overwhelmed and inadequate in so many aspects - marriage, motherhood, and trying to maintain a professional life - that Elizabeth feels all too often. It's what causes her to become dangerously immersed in Adele's story.Between Here and April is an engrossing page-turner with depth. I just wish I'd liked Elizabeth a little more - while I did connect with her, at times I also found myself getting irritated with her. I thought the novel wrapped up a bit too neatly, so it's not entirely clear to me how much she really grew from her experience with the Cassidys' story, but I think this book will stick with me a while just the same."}, {"userName": "Tiffany ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3813245-tiffany", "userReview": "Ugh! I really hate that I have to give this two stars. I really liked this book for the most part. I found the story of April and her murder very interesting, and I was curious to see how Lizzie's marriage and motherhood would blend with Adele's. These are the issues I had with the story:1) Why don't we ever find out why Mark is so obsessed with bondage? We never learn why he needs it, and we never find out if he and Lizzie work through it. In fact, we don't even know why she freaks and leaves him. What did he do this time that was so different from the others that she couldn't take it anymore?2) We never find out of Lizzie finally tells Mark about her rape. Why not? That was a big plot point that really got me. Here he is trying to get her into bondage and she clearly has issues with it because of the rape, yet she doesn't say anything to him about it? I find it hard to believe.3) Now this is why I am really upset about the book. I was really interested to see how the author was going to get Adele's story into the plot. Obviously we weren't going to hear from Adele herself, but how was she going to portay her thoughts and reasonings so we may understand why she did what she did? It really pissed me off that the author decided to have Lizzie write a story about it. It seemed like a cop out to me. I didn't read 200+ pages to hear Adele's side of the story just so I could read some story Lizzie made up on her own. I also didn't like that she had April talking about her like she was the best thing ever. I don't believe that April would have been yapping about her when her mother was acting so strange. I wanted the author to find a way to tell us Adele's side, not make something up. I would have been happier if she just left it as it was, with nobody every truly being able to know what happened. Then she could have spent more time on Lizzie and Mark's relationship and cleared up that mess. Overall, I was happy with the book until about page 220 or so. Then it all went downhill, almost like the author knew it was time to wrap things up and she needed to figure out what the best and fastest way to do it was."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3376463-carol", "userReview": "I expected Between Here and April to be more of a detective story instead of an intense fictional look at the darker side of motherhood, including post-partum depression and psychosis. Anyone who's ever read an article about a woman who has harmed her children, and thought \"How could a mother ever do that?\" may find some insight in this book.The protagonist in the book is a mom of two, juggling a freelance career with her struggling marriage and the chaos of young children. When she begins having fainting episodes, she consults a psychiatrist, and discovers disturbing memories of a childhood friend who went missing. As Lizzie looks into the mystery of what happened to April, she soon discovers that April's mother killed April and her sister, then committed suicide. Here's where the line between April's story and Lizzie's story blurs. Lizzie's quest to uncover how April's mother could have done such an unspeakable thing acts as lightning rod for Lizzie's own inner turmoil. Some of Lizzie's turmoil has to do with problems in her marriage, her own mother's failings, and her repression of a brutal incident while on a photojournalist's shoot. But some of what Lizzie investigates is the unpleasant side of being a mom, the side you'll never see on a long-distance-telephone commercial or a greeting card. How exhausting giving one's all to a child can be; how childrearing can sap the energy & vitality out of even a good marriage; how even the most loving and doting mother sometimes wants to beat the crap out of her kids because no one else knows how to push her buttons as well as they do.

Take your time to mull it over after you race through it.On motherhood, author Deborah Copaken Kogan writes: With all of its invisible frustrations and sacrifices, motherhood was also a remarkable mosaic-in-progress, with such moments, like hand-made tiles, painstakingly inlaid: up close, just a jumble of colors, haphazardly placed in no particular order; from ten feet back, so beautiful you could cry.and...another truth I was just figuring out in my own home: that a mother could exist but not always mother.

At the time, Elizabeth couldn't get an explanation from her teacher, and her mother was too busy with a new baby and her own issues to really notice that Elizabeth's friend was gone. The truth of what happened isn't too hard for Elizabeth to find out as an adult. After all, when a mother kills herself and her two daughters, there are newspapers articles, which Elizabeth is easily able to find. But it turns out that her search is really to know the unknowable: why did April's mother do this seemingly unthinkable thing?On a quest to try to answer this question, Elizabeth confronts issues of postpartum depression, especially in the early 1970s, before it was recognized as a treatable condition, and the common prescription of Valium to help women who were depressed, whether it actually benefited them or not.

It shines a light not only on postpartum depression but on the way it was and is treated. It does not justify the murder/suicide but helps you see inside her head a little.

Forget fame, danger and sex: Nothing compares with the thrill of tucking little ones into bed after supper.Or so Deborah Copaken Kogan told us in Shutterbabe, her wild 2001 memoir of capturing war photos and male booty. Fresh out of Harvard, this Potomac, Md., native ventured into Afghanistan, Bucharest and the Soviet Union during some of the most alarming crises of recent history. But then she found the man of her dreams and settled down in Manhattan to raise a family.Well, the seven-year itch is an equal opportunity employer.Kogan's first novel, Between Here and April, is an amalgamation of autobiography, true crime and melodrama. Her heroine is a wife and mother named Elizabeth, a former globetrotting journalist from Potomac, Md., who found the man of her dreams and settled down in Manhattan to raise a family. Trouble is, the glow of domestic paradise has faded. Making cupcakes for the grade school has lost its thrill, and arguing about housework during sex is a turn-off. At 41, married to a workaholic, Elizabeth feels as though she's \"playing house all alone,\" and it's an exhausting, dispiriting routine, more than enough to make a prematurely retired international journalist pine for war in the mountains of Afghanistan.With \"Between Here and April,\" Kogan confronts in the most dramatic terms imaginable the feminist issues that seemed too cutely brushed aside in her memoir. She has a good ear for the basic patterns -- including the clich\u00e9s -- of married life among the professional class. Mothers everywhere will relate to Elizabeth's efforts to keep her once exciting career alive with a hodgepodge of freelance jobs that are neither satisfying nor lucrative: \"writing press releases about antifungal medications and a new brand of sneakers for a viral marketing firm, comparing the suction strength of various breast pumps for an online parenting site.\"When the story opens, Elizabeth and her husband are on a date at the theater, a rare chance to get out of their apartment and away from the kids. \"Medea\" seems like a poor choice for this -- or any -- romantic rendezvous, but as a model of bad parenting Euripides' tragedy is pretty clear, and it also gives a fair indication of this novel's heavy-handedness. No one can endure that play without flinching, but it has an even more powerful effect on Elizabeth: During the climatic scene when Medea begins slaughtering her two little boys, Elizabeth suddenly recalls a brief friendship, 35 years earlier, with April Cassidy in the first grade. She begins to panic, stands up from her seat and faints in the aisle.The bulk of the novel is spent trying to understand why she reacted so dramatically to \"Medea\" and the memory it triggered. With her therapist's encouragement, Elizabeth begins researching what happened to April, the girl she knew for only two months in 1972. She finds a story in The Washington Post that describes a woman who murdered her two children -- April and her sister -- and then committed suicide. This part of the novel is apparently based on fact. In a note provided by her publisher, Kogan writes, \"I would like to protect, if possible, the surviving father from unwanted inquiries, which is why I wound up writing this as a novel, not as nonfiction.\"Kogan's heroine, however, has no such qualms about protecting anyone's privacy. Elizabeth hopes to restart her career by making a documentary about this tragedy, a project that inspires many more questions, \"all the while circling back to the most obvious, least answerable, and most terrifying question of all: How could a mother kill her children?\"Elizabeth interviews people in Montgomery County who were connected with the doomed family, and she finds transcripts of the mother's psychiatric sessions during the weeks leading up to the murders. Her research seems ridiculously easy -- everybody remembers in colorful detail the events of 35 years ago or left helpful records -- but the story is so engaging that I just shrugged and raced along. That's also a credit to this narrator's wonderfully appealing voice: funny, frustrated, likable, totally candid about her desires and failings.The novel's rising suspense stems from the way Elizabeth's investigation gradually takes over her life. As she looks deeper into the horrific death of her first-grade friend, her attention turns to April's mother with surprising sympathy. \"I wanted,\" she says, \"to understand her: to crawl under her flesh, to feel her heart beating in my chest, to see a world turned hopeless and dim through her own eyes.\" That desire drives her research, and Elizabeth begins to identify with this accursed mother in the most alarming ways.Although the eventual crisis approaches Medea proportions, without Euripides' grand characters, the novel slides toward bathos. It's awfully exciting, but I wish that Kogan had exercised a little more subtlety. Her narration falls into such a clear schematic pattern, highlighting its feminist points like the syllabus in a women's studies seminar: post-partum depression, medical gender bias, rape, surrogate caregivers, domestic inequality, pornography, etc. Maybe that makes Between Here and April the perfect book club book, but I suspect that readers -- working mothers especially -- will find these complex issues are resolved here too neatly and sweetly. http://articles.washingtonpost.com/20..."}, {"userName": "Alison Dawson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3350087-alison-dawson", "userReview": "I almost want this to be a 4 star, but it just doesn\u2019t quite get there for me.
