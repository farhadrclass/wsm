The second volume is a real nail-biter as we anxiously wait to see how the world will respond to the birth of an AI that by its very nature monitors everything we do online. For the last year, I've been looking forward to reading the conclusion. As compulsively readable as the first two books, Wonder ends the WWW trilogy on a optimistic but frustratingly shallow note. As Webmind notes, there is a dearth of sci-fi that regards AIs in an optimistic light, and I really appreciate Sawyer's take here. That said, Sawyer is awfully liberal with projecting the values of the WIRED demographic onto society at large (and how ballsy he is, scripting a full John Stewart interview while using composites or anonymity elsewhere!). Also, wheres the previous two books dealt more with objective science & tech, Wonder's primary focus is ethics; while I might agree with much of what Sawyer's saying, the pedagogy is a little heavy-handed, especially when filtered through Hobo. Taken as a whole, the WWW trilogy is a wonderful read and Webmind a marvelous addition to the catelog of great sci-fi characters, even if he left me feeling disappointed."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael", "userReview": "I devoured the last two installments in Robert J. Sawyer's \"WWW\" trilogy and was anxious for the third installment to hit the shelves. I was fascinated to see how Sawyer would bring together some of the threads we saw in book one and to find out the final fate of the Webmind. So, I guess you could say I had some pretty high expectations for \"WWW: Wonder.\" And I guess you could say that the book didn't exactly live up to them.It's still a good story and the ideas raised in the book are fascinating ones. The concept of how humanity would react if an artificial intelligence developed that was interested in bringing out the best in humanity instead of trying to exterminate us all is compelling and fascinating. Watching as Webmind tries to use his new seemingly limitless intelligence to connect things together to find cures for cancer and to try to bring out better instincts in humanity is interesting. And seeing the reaction of certain groups to the evolution of Webmind and making steps to try and stop the AI in its tracks before it becomes too powerful helps drive much of the second half of the story.But for all of that, I can't help but come away from the novel feeling a bit let down and disappointed by how it all ends. Sawyer does manage to weave the plotline of the Great Firewall of China, Bobo the Monkey and Webmind together in the story's final chapters. But there are times when Sawyer is too obvious in his political views and it comes across on the page. Thinly veiled criticism of recent administrations occur often in the novel as do complete and utter support of other political factions, parties and administrations. I get that the characters (and to some extend Sawyer) are passionate in their beliefs and feelings on these issues, but if I wanted political diatribe, I'd flip on a cable news outlet. Those moments took me too far out of the book to really become as immersed in the story and characters as I was by the first two. Looking back, there were those moments there as well but they didn't pull me out of the book in the way those moments do here. It's a shame really because it keeps what could have been a great trilogy of novels and makes them just merely pretty darn good. The novels are worth reading and I'm not sorry for the investment of time I put into them. As I said before Sawyer has some fascinating ideas in this trilogy and this book. It's just a shame that the series had to come to an end with a disappointing third installment."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3648871-matt", "userReview": "While Saywer has long been one of my favourite sci-fi authors, I have had a few disappointments with a few of his works in the past. The WWW trilogy's first two books renewed my confidence in RJS and had me eagerly awaiting WWW:Wonder. The final installment though was not quite what I came to expect after reading the first two novels.The story was definitely entertaining, and continued on logically from where WATCH left off. The characters were all back in some meaningful way, and up until about 3/4 of the way through the novel I was really enjoying it. Then I found there to be a downward turn in the plot. Great science fiction relies on the basis that what is happening is at least plausible. It takes current technology and extrapolates it into something new and believable. Webmind is a good example of taking something we currently have, the internet, and taking it to the next level. (It isn't a far stretch of the imagination to assume that the web and A.I. may at somepoint converge), but I feel that Sawyer went a bit too far at the end.*Potential Spoilers ahead*Forget the world changing effects Webmind had on a particular country, which I found was not believable in the slightest, but the commentary of Webmind in the future was extraneous. The story had a satisfactory climax, even in the premise was a bit unbelievable. But to fast forward billions of years was rediculous. Am I, the reader, really to accept the fact that the internet still exists that far into the future? And that webmind is still relevant and functional. Seems too unrealistic to me.Overall the WWW trilogy was good reading. Personal score is 8/10."}, {"userName": "\u0623\u0634\u0631\u0641 \u0641\u0642\u064a\u0647", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2220828", "userReview":

and final volume in the series. It faithfully continues the formula of following an emergent AI through the eyes of a previously blind High School girl, converting high concept SF into something sweet and human, even somewhat juvenile. As usual, the author seasons it thoroughly with little science nuggets.This installment is by far the most suspenseful, as the 'life' of our beloved AI is threatened on several fronts, and there are many clues that it is far darker than it seemed.I was moved to tears by the ending, which was extravagantly sweet. This installment had even better thoughts on game theory, but became even more silly about the high school girl. There was a very silly scene where her dorky boyfriend had to push her down the street in the office chair, to give her the feeling of speed, so that she could go faster in the visual representation of the web, so that she could break through the \"Great Firewall of China, a severing of connections between the rest of the world in China.I continue to protest the premise of where the AI gets its resources, and his thoughts on what could cause a self-consciousness to arise. Granted, he has many credentials in the area, but it's still hypothetical till it happens, and I am convinced that there must be a self-centred drive. When the machine must calculate what helps it reach its goals, that's when it must contemplate the notion of 'self' and begin to improve the powers of that self to reach its goals. I predict that will be consciousness or something very much like it."}, {"userName": "John Carter McKnight", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2410586-john-carter-mcknight", "userReview": "Robert J. Sawyer embodies the reasons why many of us were drawn to science fiction, way back when: as the title of the book expresses, \"wonder.\" In this sweet, sympathetic conclusion to his emergent-AI trilogy, Sawyer gives us a book-length \"it gets better\" video, from school bullying to governmental tyranny to fear of change and each other.Caitlyn Decter continues to grow up, perhaps the most sweetly real teenage character in SF history (I totally fantasy-cast her as the young woman who plays Alexis on Castle: they've got the same tentative-but-steady maturity and math geekiness). Some of the ideological set-pieces are the most fun scenes of the book: a global coming-out of a closeted minority, a schoolyard fight, a couple swift debates between Webmind and Caitlyn's mom, over human moral progress. Some of the story's edge is blunted by Sawyer's sweetness (one political calling-on-the-carpet scene seemed unrealistically short on wrath), but for classic Roddenberry-esque faith in human goodness, you can't beat Wonder."}, {"userName": "Michael Christopher", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5884605-michael-christopher", "userReview": "Sawyer builds on the web that he wove during the second book in the trilogy as governments and individuals struggle to cope with the reality of the internet having come to life. The pacing of the novel is on par with WATCH, but with the complex back-story is already in place the novel is able to leap from place to place and so it feels like a more nimble read. As Sawyer's characters explore the new world that dawns with the AI now omnipresent, the story explores the ramifications of our behaviour: dry scientific theories are brought to life as analogies are drawn between them and the bloody reality of humanity, all-too-likely hostile reactions are juxtaposed against the possible benefits of such an AI, humanity's constant choice between violent self-interest and peaceful community relationships is starkly laid out, and yet none of the discussions or events seem forced or contrived. True to form, the complex web of Sawyer's story converges on a thrilling climax that rattles the reader immediately before and epic ending that will not be easily forgotten."}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1153204-alan", "userReview": "Robert J. Sawyer brings his WWW trilogy to a satisfying and very definite conclusion in this volume\u2014yes, folks, amazing as it may sound, the man's actually written a trilogy that consists of just three books, no mean feat these days.I'm assuming you're at least somewhat familiar with the previous installments in Sawyer's series about a nascent world-spanning artificial intelligence that evolves out of World Wide Web network traffic. If not, go back and pick up the first two before even considering this one\u2014this is by no means a standalone novel, and it does depend heavily upon familiarity with its predecessors.The WWW series is also not the first word on the subject of sympathetic machine intelligences... I'd also recommend (if you have not already done so) reading seminal works like Robert Heinlein's The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, with its protagonist Mike HOLMES; David Gerrold's When H.A.R.L.I.E. Was One (either the original or the \"2.0\" version Gerrold updated later); or\u2014if you can find it\u2014Thomas J. Ryan's The Adolescence of P-1, which gets explicitly acknowledged in WWW:Wonder.In this installment, the Webmind (as he has styled himself) (and the pronoun is Webmind's choice as well, by the way\u2014Webmind has decided that his gender is male, and who are we to gainsay him?) has awakened and matured, and has already managed to survive at least one serious attempt to end his existence, all with the assistance of his human mentor Caitlin Decter (one of the most complex and interesting fictional teenagers I've ever run across)... but Webmind's long-term survival is by no means assured. The (unnamed, but rather Obama-ish) U.S. President's top advisors are counseling a preemptive strike \"while we still can,\" against the threat of an omniscient electronic dictator, however benign. And all of Webmind's protestations\u2014accurate though they may be\u2014about his dependence upon humanity's continued existence, about his gratitude towards the entities that brought him into being, and about his rational moral stance in general, make no difference to people whose profession is paranoia.So even though it might seem that all of the conflicts Webmind might have were taken care of in the first two books, that turns out not to be the case. Sawyer knows how to write a taut thriller (to recycle a phrase), and he succeeds in making both Webmind and his humans sympathetic and interesting. There's one scene set at a high-school dance that particularly thrilled me, in which Sawyer manages to come up with a realistic (well, within the context of the story) way to have the underdog triumph, and with a neat turn of phrase to boot.Although Sawyer's prose is never really lyrical, and he's occasionally blatantly didactic, I found myself eagerly turning pages to find out What Happened Next. He manages to keep his penchant for infodumps to a minimum in this volume, while still including some interesting speculations about humanity's physical and social evolution along the way.I won't say this book is superior to WWW:Watch\u2014that was the one that really impressed me with its improvement over its predecessor... but WWW:Wonder does deliver the goods, at Internet speed."}, {"userName": "Cathy ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526945-cathy", "userReview": "3.5 stars. Very readable, if overly preachy, as usually. I do like the central message, which is that a win-win outcome is possible in the information age, if we just believe it is. But there are a few rants that are as annoying as ever (Caitlin's Dad's lecture about why sexting is ok is just absurd) and the teen romance is unnecessarily rushed and uncomfortable, despite a few sweet moments. Wrapping up Hobo's involvement seemed really promising for a while, then petered out. And the big huge surprise was, um... a fun but totally unrealistic idea. I don't know, I just feel like it got away from him. He was trying to make a big point and he tried to make it so big that he lost the reality of it. But it's nice to see a story with a positive spin, debates about morality, and serious themes carried out in generally entertaining ways, that's my favorite kind of sci-fi. There is a lot of meat here, just not as much as the author thinks there is, and the story that carries it isn't quite as strong as it could or should be either. It's good, better than average, but not in my great pile. And I always get rubbed wrong by the author's bio, and reading it immediately following the story has probably made this review a bit more negative than it may otherwise have been. Something about the way he lists his many, many awards just strikes me as really arrogant. I don't know why, he's earned the honors. Read it for yourself, see what you think.

Using the term \"usurping\" is perhaps unfair as the point of the story may have, from the start, been to express pride in Canada's achievements and expound upon the moral superiority of Sawyer's convictions. What was only an undertone in the previous two books, and to a lesser degree FlashForward, was at a completely different level in this book. It broke the consistency of the series in my mind.The author was so blatant in this as to label, as jerks, everyone who would have advised against the underage sex scene. Never mind that the two sixteen year old virgins had met for the first time only two months earlier and were in the midst of an extremely emotional situation. In my mind, tolerance should mean that you can accept people of differing opinion without unilaterally dismissing them with a label, thereby gaining the superiority to describe them as intolerant.

Sawyer\u2019s WWW Trilogy about Webmind, the vast consciousness that spontaneously emerged from the World Wide Web. It was a fitting and perfectly satisfying ending to the series. Fans will be very pleased with how well Sawyer ties up all the loose ends, making it clear that this was a well thought out and thoroughly researched story.  After discovering the existence of Webmind, the US government tried but failed to exterminate him. Now, that Webmind made it very clear that he is devoted to assisting the humanity and helping it thrive rather than sabotaging or harming it, most people came to trust him and they often seek his advice or even virtual companionship. There are, however, those who consider him to be a threat and they won\u2019t rest until they succeed in \u201ckilling\u201d the fast learning AI. But is Webmind really a threat? Is it safe to trust him? What will happen next? As with Watch, you can pick up a copy of Wonder and start reading without having to read the previous books in the series and you will have no problem following the plot. It\u2019s written in a way that allows each book in the trilogy to stand on its own. Sawyer smoothly introduces all the important events from the previous books, without detracting from the flow of the story. But of course, reading the series as a whole is strongly recommended. There are plenty of subtleties and nuances to savor which you really don\u2019t want to miss. The dialogues are very natural and often humorous. The storyline is spiked with a whole lot of fascinating scientific information and curiosities that enrich the plot and are served in an easy-to-digest way.  Curious what others thought about Wonder, I read quite a few reviews and was surprised to see that many people found this final installment to be not as good as the previous ones, or even disappointing. Frankly, I don\u2019t really understand what their opinions are based on. I was very pleased with the way the story unraveled. I liked the way the plot threads expanded and intertwined with each other. Every piece of the puzzle fell into the right place, creating a complete and unforgettable picture. What pleased me the most, though, was the way Sawyer ended this epic tale about the evolved consciousness of the Internet. I wouldn\u2019t call it a cliffhanger, although it had a similar astonishing effect on me. It left me speechless and I found myself pondering the possible outcomes of something similar to Webmind emerging in our world. This book made me think and, well, wonder\u2026 And isn\u2019t this exactly what a good story is supposed to do?  I loved all the characters in this story, especially Webmind. They\u2019re all vivid and three-dimensional. I found it very easy to get emotionally attached to them, which made following their stories even more enjoyable. I\u2019m so thankful to Sawyer that he didn\u2019t go for creating a dystopian vision of the future in which Webmind turns out to be the worst thing ever happened to mankind. We\u2019ve all seen Matrix, Terminator and Space Odyssey, as well as a hundred other movies/books in which the artificial intelligence eventually turns against the humans and decides to exterminate us. We don\u2019t really need yet another retelling of the same old story, right? And so I\u2019m really glad that this book is so unique and fresh in its take on this subject. Sawyer pained a potentially wonderful future and I often found myself wishing I could live in that era to witness that kind of technological progress.  Overall, this was a great read. I had wonderful time devouring all three books in the WWW Trilogy and can\u2019t wait to check out more of Robert\u2019s works. He\u2019s a marvelous writer, well deserving of all the awards he won. I said it before and I will say it again: this is easily one of the best SF series ever!"}, {"userName": "Tim Chaplin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2980391-tim-chaplin", "userReview": "After reading the first two books in the trilogy I wasn\u2019t sure how the story of Webmind and Caitlin Decker who discovered him would finish. I was worried that I might be disappointed by the outcome. Webmind is an artificial intelligence that evolved from the internet. Caitlin Decker is a young girl who was once blind until she was given sight by a device that she calls an EYE pad. The device was originally meant to fix problem with her sight that she had had from birth, giving her vision back in one eye but Caitlin discovers that she can actually see the internet itself. These books ask the question of what would happen if there was a form of artificial intelligence running the internet? The US government security services do their best to shut it down after failing once before to close it down. Colonel Peyton Hume cannot see that Webmind is a force for good and uses all means necessary to eliminate it. China has already raised a firewall once before to cover up the outbreak of a virus and the killings of those infected to control the spread of the virus. They are seeking to make the firewall permanent again but they have a hacker in their midst who has already opened up holes in the firewall.These series of books have some interesting ideas. There are many examples of the benefits of crowd sourcing: people coming together to write open source software, seek help in building new devices from off the shelf electrical parts and scientists sharing ideas. This book seeks to take it further by the idea of people making decisions instead of government. However, sometimes I think that Sawyer is rather too positive about the benefits of technology. Social networks have been growing stronger but can we rely on groups of people making decisions on important subjects that affect us all? E-democracy has been used to seek individual\u2019s opinions in focus groups before but it doesn\u2019t meant that everyone\u2019s voice is heard as their representatives may just be interpreting the results to achieve their own ends. The recent Egyptian revolt in 2010 used social media to challenge the government and has been a positive force for change. On the other hand only those who have access to this technology can participate. Equally popular polls could end in controversial decisions such as capital punishment being re-instituted after years of informed debate and legal precedent outlawing it in most western democracies.What would also happen if an artificial intelligence could find a cure for Cancer and other complex issues through the co-operation of scientists, doctors and experts? This could be a positive thing but I could also see there being a backlash by the multinationals that manufacture and control the supply of drugs and products in a capitalist free market. Software companies would equally be upset if an artificial intelligences started putting 'verified by Webmind' on safe searches instead of their own security software.Robert Sawyer continues to speak about technology subjects across the world and has consulted for companies like Google and Motorola. He has managed to keep my attention over this series of books through the interesting characters he has created and I hope he continues to write more thought provoking future science fiction stories."}, {"userName": "Tim Hicks", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111076-tim-hicks", "userReview": "Four stars for enjoyable, but don't forget that this is, as others have said, SF Lite. Despite all the modern stuff, there's a Heinlein-juvenile feeling throughout. Written for smart teens? If so, I think it's done well. Don't read this except as the third of three. Plenty of interesting ideas. As is often the case with Sawyer, there are perhaps too many characters who seem\u00a0to be there so the author can make a point about what they represent. There's a lot of explaining, but a fair bit of it was necessary, and again, if you've read Sawyer before you'll expect it. Sawyer's a liberal, and if you're not down with that go read someone else, you won't like him. The multiple plotlines gave the book some dimension, and we didn't have to stretch too far to believe in how they came together. The epilogue (SPOILER ALERT) was disappointing. We are asked to believe that although humans are long gone, the power generators and routers are still humming away and the AIs are still using packet switching to communicate.
