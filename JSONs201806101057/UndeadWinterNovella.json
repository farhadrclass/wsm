In this short story the zombies are sentient, smart, and conniving. They are also wicked in ways I've never seen before.This story is broken up into multiple POV, and at times I became frustrated with the constant switching back and forth. It seemed as though there were too many main characters, and while the chapters jump from protagonist to protagonist, they also jump around in time too. So while you are trying to remember which character you are reading about and what happened to him/her already, you are also trying to determine where they are in time- past or present.The only reason this gets a 2 instead of a 3 star rating is because the zombies were also imbued with an insatiable sexual appetite that was a little more than off-putting. At one point in the story, two male zombies rape a woman to death and in another scene, zombie siblings go at it. Geez and ick. There's more gross factor to that, than if they'd just chowed down on some human brains. I just saw this has been written into a full length book. Will I read it? I don't know. The zombie rape scenes really freaked me out. Maybe, maybe not. I really did appreciate the fact that they weren't mindless, but still...did I mention a brother and a sister zombie went at it? I did? Ok, good. Because that's definitely worth mentioning."}, {"userName": "Jules", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4868121-jules", "userReview": "OK, let me preface this by saying this is a novellette, not a full length book. So if you're purchasing this expecting a 70,000+ word novel, you're probably going to be confused.On to the good stuff.I loved this! \"Undead Winter\" follows the perspective of five people stuck in the midst of a zombie apocalypse -- Marcus, Christoph, Lana, Marge, and the President. Each of their stories is divided into two halves, with the first half providing us with insight into each of their (often very precarious) situations. It's a quick glimpse, but enough to build for us a picture of what's happening. In the second half, we see the conclusions to each of their stories.I thought this was really well done. The stories are woven expertly together. With each chapter I found myself getting sucked into that character's story, and often found myself on the edge of my seat (sometimes quite literally). And just when I'd think I was at a point where I couldn't take anymore, it would switch to a different perspective and the buildup would happen all over again. And then the second set of each character's chapters begins, and I'm wondering how it was ever going to wrap up in time. But somehow it does. At the end I was left with this kind of \"ohh!\" moment as everything came together.I read it in one sitting, and I plan to go back to it. I have a feeling I was so wrapped up in the characters' stories the first time, so involved with their plight, that I missed some of the details. I look forward to going back and taking my time with it.It's definitely a story I'd recommend. And especially if you're a horror fan and/or fan of zombie stories."}, {"userName": "Jake Pruden", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19438260-jake-pruden", "userReview": "I got this book for free on Amazon and wasnt expecting much since it was a novella. How much of a zombie story could possibly be written in a short story? My mind has been blown. I coudlnt beleive how invested i became in the characters. I finished reading this just a few days ago and its still in my mind. This book is what novellas are for. Williams is a brilliant writer. He keeps it simple and gives us just enough that our imagiation can run wile, and it does. I think im forever a fan. im excited that its being put into a full length novel and curious to see what he does with it. This is truly one of the most intense horror and psychological thrillers ive ever read. i definitely recommend this."}, {"userName": "Randy Harmelink", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2029520-randy-harmelink", "userReview": "This just wasn't my kind of zombie/infected story. I didn't care for the nature of the zombies/infected and I'm not a fan of books that are alternating between 4 and 5 stories, especially in something of this length. Probably an unfair criticism, because the stories did connect."}, {"userName": "Larry Williams", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18784174-larry-williams", "userReview": "This story proves that adage \"short and sweet\" to the tenth degree. The cover shows enough to create the mental image of a nightmare unfolding in the coldest of hells. That set the stage for an amazing read.Once inside; I expected an exciting story of life and death containing the expected depictions of undead former humans lurking around and eating the living. I was pleasantly surprised that there was more to it than that. Each main character was not only facing death or a future wandering without a pulse; they were also connecting with me.You will find something in common with most; if not all, of the characters. You will put yourself in their shoes and walk in their struggle. Most readers will find each tale as a metaphor to something that is causing grief in their own lives. That is the beauty of this tale.For those who haven't read this yet; this is a must read even if you don't like zombie genre. As mentioned; it goes above and beyond that level. You'll get the horror, suspense, fear. However; you'll also see love, morals, redemption, and relationships.I highly recommend Undead Winter!"}, {"userName": "Ren\u00e9", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2184988-ren", "userReview": "A review copy of this book was provided by the author.I started this story expecting it to be just another version of the same old zombie apocalypse. What I got was so much more. This novella pulled me in quick and had me on the edge of my seat until the very end. It brings a very new and interesting twist to the world of zombies. It had me wondering what I would do if something like this really ever happened.Undead Winter follows 5 characters, Marcus, Christoph, Lana, Marge, and the President, through the zombie epidemic. Each point of view is split into two halves, the buildup and conclusion. The first half of each story gives you enough to keep you wanting more. The second half pulls the stories together in such a way that I could not put the book down.I cannot wait until the full length novel, Masochists, comes out. I would also love to see this turned into a motion picture."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3123087-amy", "userReview": "I received this novella free in exchange for a review.I read this in one sitting because I just couldn\u2019t put it down. The stories\u2019 perspective is told by different people. It doesn\u2019t matter if they are in the same situation, each person will have a different story to tell. I love this style of writing. The infection causes people to become primal. Even though the heart has stopped, there is still some human left in the brain function. Just enough to get them by. However, the primal rage and urges take over, slowly. It\u2019s like drowning, you are aware of your surroundings, you are aware things are changing and not for the better. As you read, you realize this is NOT your grandma\u2019s zombies any more. I\u2019m very happy to see that T.M. Williams will be making this into a novel."}, {"userName": "Liz Wright", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1172360-liz-wright", "userReview": "I am by no means an expert in anything zombie, but I enjoy a good zombie story. I read Undead Winter with an expectation that it was going to be another zombie story (which is not a high expectation). Completely wrong. When I finished reading, I shook my tablet, saying, \u201cNO, MORE!!!! I want MORE!\u201d While this was a novella, as the reader you definitely felt connected to the characters and enjoyed watching the interactions between the different characters unfold. Each section describes a different person\u2019s experience during the infestation, and they all come together at points which give you \u201caha!\u201d moments. Having read a couple of different \u201ctakes\u201d on zombies, I really liked what the author added to the lore. I\u2019m excited to read The Apocalypse next."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1718738-nicole", "userReview": "I'm pretty \"into\" zombies... I live for \"The Walking Dead\". I've seen \"28 Days Later\" and \"28 Weeks Later\", the \"Resident Evil\"'s, \"Dead Snow\", etc. and I even love the comedies like \"Zombieland\" and \"Shawn of the Dead\". I've read \"The Passage\" and \"The Twelve\". I've played \"Plants vs Zombies\" ;)So I thought this book would be a version of something I've already seen or read. Not even close. This is a must read for any zombie-phile! I really enjoyed going from character to character and their individual experiences. And I'm beyond thrilled that TM Williams is expanding this novella into a full fledged novel!"}, {"userName": "Jan B", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8849392-jan-b", "userReview": "I will admit that I was a bit hesitant to read this book at first since zombies aren't really my thing. Well call me pleasantly surprised. It wasn't what I was expecting at all, which I suppose was based on stereotypes and a viewing of Night of the Living Dead when I was a kid. I was immediately drawn in and felt vested in the fate of the characters somehow. Since it is a novella I was left wanting more and that's the best compliment I can give this book. If you tend to like this genre, then this is a must read. If it's normally not something you would reach for, expand your horizons a bit. I think you will be pleasantly surprised."}, {"userName": "Jenna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17660559-jenna", "userReview": "The author posted a free chapter on her facebook, and I was immediately wanting more. I went to amazon and had it sent to my ipad, I was amazed at the strength of the characters, the depth of emotions, the feelings that this story evoked in me, and how invested I became in these characters lives in such a short period. This is truly the best short story I've ever read, and at the end had me frantically trying to turn the page, hoping there would be more. If this is any indication of the works that T.M.
