One of my favorite things about Charles Martin is his ability to not only paint a picture, but to layer it with sights and smells and sounds. This collection is no different. In each story the reader visits a place they may never have been and it somehow feels familiar. The people are like people we've met or known. It serves as a reminder that we really are only separated from one another by a very thin veil. Not one moment of my time reading here was wasted, not one."}, {"userName": "Linda Buzard-Moffitt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37985369-linda-buzard-moffitt", "userReview": "Great collectionThis is three really good stories that make up a great collection.

A child with a doubtful future. And a shared journey toward healing for both their hearts.It begins on the shaded town square in a sleepy Southern town. A spirited seven-year-old has a brisk business at her lemonade stand. But the little girl\u2019s pretty yellow dress can\u2019t quite hide the ugly scar on her chest.Her latest customer, a bearded stranger, drains his cup and heads to his car, his mind on a boat he's restoring at a nearby lake. The stranger understands more about the scar than he wants to admit. And the beat-up bread truck careening around the corner with its radio blaring is about to change the trajectory of both their lives.Before it's over, they'll both know there are painful reasons why crickets cry . . . and that miracles lurk around unexpected corners.\n  \n    Chasing Fireflies\n  \nThey have one summer to find what was lost long ago.\u201cNever settle for less than the truth,\u201d she told him.\u00a0But when you don't even know your real name, the truth gets a little complicated. It can nestle so close to home it's hard to see. It can even flourish inside a lie. And as Chase Walker discovered, learning the truth about who you are can be as elusive\u2014and as magical\u2014as chasing fireflies on a summer night.A haunting story about fishing, baseball, home cooking, and other matters of life and death.\n  \n    Wrapped in Rain\n  \nAn internationally famous photographer, Tucker Mason, has traveled the world, capturing things other people don\u2019t see. But what Tucker himself can\u2019t see is how to let go of the past and forgive his father.On a sprawling Southern estate, Tucker and his younger brother, Mutt, were raised by their housekeeper, Miss Ella Rain, who loved the motherless boys like her own. Hiring her to take care of Waverly Hall and the boys was the only good thing their father ever did.When his brother escapes from a mental hospital and an old girlfriend appears with her son and a black eye, Tucker is forced to return home and face the agony of his own tragic past.Though Miss Ella has been gone for many years, Tuck can still hear her voice\u2014and her prayers. But finding peace and starting anew will take a measure of grace that Tucker scarcely believes in., Mutt, were raised by their housekeeper, Miss Ella Rain, who loved the motherless boys like her own.
