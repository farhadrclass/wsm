She also appears to be a kindly soul, in a tea-and-crumpets sort of way, but she\u2019s still, I repeat, a silly person. In a recent Salon interview, she bemoaned the atheistic impertinencies of Bill Maher and Sam Harris, comparing the two men to Nazis for their criticism of Islam. \u2018It fills me with despair,\u2019 she said. \u2018This is the sort of talk that led to the concentration camps.\u2019Now, you don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Maher or Harris to see how insane that is. Never mind that a supposedly respectable writer has so airily breached Godwin\u2019s Law. Never mind that both men in question\u2014a Hollywood liberal and a neuroscientist\u2014are Jewish. And never mind that, unlike real Nazis, they\u2019re not inciting violence or threatening anyone. The question here is simple: are we allowed to mock and criticize religious dogma, or are we not? Are we allowed to say things like \u2018Islam [or Wicca or Scientology] is the mother lode of bad ideas,\u2019 or are we not? Armstrong\u2019s answer is a curt no. And if you do, you\u2019re obviously a Nazi.Armstrong\u2019s potshot represents an inconsequential skirmish in the culture wars, but it shows how imperfectly the whole Enlightenment thing has been assimilated by certain minds. If even a writer as sweetly reasonable as Armstrong claims to be can say such things, it means we\u2019ve still got a ways to go before we beat down the old inf\u00e2me. It\u2019s still out there, snarling and slavering and pulling at its chain. It\u2019s enough to fill you with despair, or some less melodramatic emotion.But what the hell does any of this have to do with a book about 19th-century France? Quite a bit, actually. Many of our ideological squabbles today, like the one described above, are faint and distant echoes of a much nastier brawl that roiled French society from about 1870 onwards. Reading For the Soul of France, you see some familiar conflicts being rehearsed\u2014left versus right, secularism versus religion and so on\u2014but with way more drama, bomb-throwing and duels. Although the political groupings were shifting and complex, Frederick Brown maps out the frontline thus: on one side, you had liberals and socialists fighting for a democratic and above all secular republic; on the other side, you had a lot of reactionary assholes. (That\u2019s a bit simplistic, obviously. To be more precise, the reactionary assholes included Catholics, royalists, and blood-and-soil nutjobs with a collective hard-on for Joan of Arc. Plus, of course, there were the inevitable drooling anti-Semites, but they didn\u2019t make up a group so much as trail their slime over all the other ones \u2013 including those on the left.)Summarized in this way, the book sounds like a bedtime story for liberals, with a Whiggish moral about the ultimate triumph of progressive ideas. And in fact, the narrative ends with the exoneration of Dreyfus and the official separation of church and state, lending a certain credibility to this reading. But as we know, history\u2019s not that tidy. The crazed nationalists and Jew-haters never went away; they bided their time, churned out their pamphlets, and gradually swelled the muddy little tributaries that fed fascism, finally getting their revenge in 1940. But that\u2019s another story \u2013 and one that Brown himself has recently told in a sequel. And in case you\u2019re feeling all Whiggish and bien pensant yourself, you should know that the French left also went completely insane for a few decades \u2013 but that\u2019s another story too, and I can only hope Brown is busy working on it. The blood feud that is French political history cries out for a trilogy, at the very least."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1895570-jim", "userReview": "What surprised me about Frederick Brown's For the Soul of France was its relevance to the culture wars at the beginning of the 21st century in the United States. Both fin-de-si\u00e8cle France and post-9/11 America shared a static view of their respective nations. In France's case, it was Judaism that was seen as the interloper, as symbolized in the Dreyfus affair. In the United States, large segments of the population look back to an Anglo-Saxon golden age in which Evangelical religion and conservative politics presumably held sway.Brown quotes one typical instance of Antisemitism:When in the spring of 1898, Joseph Valabr\u00e8gue, a Proven\u00e7al Jew tarred by the brush used against his brother-in-law Alfred Dreyfus, indignantly sent professions of patriotism to La Croix, the paper's official mouthpiece replied: \"I am French, the son of a Frenchman; I shall live and die as such. But you, you are a Jew, the son of a Jew and you will die a Jew.... You know full well that all through history -- from Judas, who sold his God, to Dreyfus, who sold France -- your race has bred so much treason, iniquity, and rapacity that you must at all costs hide your name, as the escaped convict hides his red bonnet.\" In this ontological court, rules of evidence did not apply. Charles Maurras praised Roman Catholicism as a \"temple of definitions\" offering people blessed asylum from that bane of human consciousness -- \"uncertainty.\"[Italics mine]One could imagine the same type of illogic being applied in political arguments at Tea Party gatherings. This is an excellent book about a period of European history that is largely unknown to most Americans. We may have heard of the Dreyfus affair, the Eiffel Tower, and the failed French attempt to build the Panama Canal; but we don't have a real grasp about the decades-long war between Catholicism and liberalism, symbolized by scientists and Jews. Today, as the French are facing a much more substantive invasion of Muslims from Algeria and other parts of North Africa, much of the conflicts of that period have become moot."}, {"userName": "MJ Huot", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13055688-mj-huot", "userReview": "Summer 2015 Re-read: Just as good the second time around.

Brown assumes a minimal knowledge of the politics of the time (First Empire, Second Republic, Third Empire, et cetera), but provides a useful chronology at the beginning of the book and adds just enough political background to keep the narrative both clear and engaging. The use of the words \u201cculture war\u201d in the subtitle is by no means a cynical ploy to attract readers, either. The words and the politics to which they give so theatrical a birth were just as relevant then as they ever have been.The tug-of-war between Catholicism and the allied forces of modernity, science, and secularism sandwiched between the times of Louis-Philippe and Napoleon III dominate the book. Any vignette to begin with would have admittedly been arbitrarily chosen, but Brown\u2019s choice of the 1863 publication of Ernst Renan\u2019s \u201cLa Vie de Jesus\u201d (\u201cThe Life of Jesus\u201d) serves as a terrific and illustrative point of departure for a book whose major themes include Renan\u2019s strident anti-clericalism. Brown also includes a couple of stories that are unfortunately little-known in the United States, but that give hints of the growing violence and division that is to come. He tells of the Union Generale, an investment syndicate launched by aristocratic, pro-Catholic associates that went on to build railroads all over Europe. Due to rampant speculation and financial impropriety on the part of the man who ran the operation, it suffered a tremendous failure \u2013 also known as the Paris Bourse crash \u2013 in January, 1882. Perhaps not surprisingly considering the events to come, the first people to be blamed were the Jews. We get detailed chapters of the building of the Panama Canal and the 1897 fire at the Charity Bazaar as well, but the heart of the book is a 55-page long chapter on perhaps the one event \u2013 or rather a long, complex series of events \u2013 that is familiar to all Americans: the Dreyfus Affair. Woven together, these bits of history provide one of a few tapestries that really are essential for understanding the French history of this period. For someone unfamiliar with the major names and events, I recommend Robert Gildea\u2019s \u201cChildren of the Revolution: The French, 1799-1914,\u201d which provides much of the political background that Brown can\u2019t cover in a brief 265 pages. Brown has a tremendous grasp of the source material. I highly recommend this to readers looking for a great bridge between popular and more formal academic history regarding this period. Reading this makes me want to pick up the Brown\u2019s Flaubert biography that I have on my shelves \u2013 or anything else that I can find by him."}, {"userName": "Lauren Albert", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2828794-lauren-albert", "userReview": "Anti-clericalism vs. clericalism?

There is less cultural context for the modern reader: so much has changed that it makes it hard to imagine events, nevermind relate to them. Plus more details have been erased by the sands of time, so often the level of generality goes up. Brown does a good job getting around this. He uses a lot of newspapers and personal letters to give the reader primary sources to relate to: what people were actually writing and reading at the time. He often uses the universal expositions, which happened approximately every decade, to anchor things in time.Based on the presence of \"Dreyfus\" in the title, I was expecting this to be more directly about anti-Semitism. The primary theme of the book is Catholic-Royalist versus Republican-Enlightenment, and anti-semitism only appears to the extent it is part of that broader conflict. For the first two-third of the book I was like \"When does Dreyfus show up? When does Dreyfus show up?\" but it was all engrossing enough that I didn't mind too much. If I were the editor, I would have subtitled this something like \"Eiffel, Dreyfus, Boulangism, and the fin-de-siecle culture wars in France\" or something that indicates its broader scope. I think if my expectations were set properly at the start, I would have enjoyed the book even more.As someone raised Irish Catholic in the United States, I grew up hearing about the Catholic Church as the representative of the little guy, especially the poor. So it was a surprise for me to read here about how, in nineteenth century France, Catholicism was strongly aligned with the aristocracy, in particular that a \"natural order\" would have a king in charge, as opposed to the atheistic Republicans. The overthrow of the king in the Revolution was like a national sin that had to be expunged, probably though a strong leader who would end the Republic and restore \"natural\" hierarchy. This was a pervasive theme: conflicts between Catholic preachers and secular teachers; the place of militant national leaders like Georges Boulanger that had echoes of royalism.The Dreyfus affair, which I only vaguely had a sense of before, was pretty consistent with my understanding of anti-Semitism in Europe: the Jews were often financiers who worked in cooperation with the aristocracy on various large-scale projects (wars, railroads). If and when those projects failed, more often due to the incompetence of the aristocrats running them, the Jews were typically thrown under the bus to avoid a financial crisis and/or repayment. Paul Johnson's A History of the Jews is also a riveting read and goes into that dynamic in more detail. Brown's chapter on the Union Generale debacle shows this more directly than the one on Dreyfus; it sort of seems like the wave of anti-Jewish resentment starts at the aristocratic level with the Union Generale and radiates outward so that the Jews become an all-out scapegoat for France's own national failings, above all the devastating loss of Alsace 1871 after the Franco-German War.In 2017, this book was resonant in terms of describing a battle for enlightenment ideals. Twenty-first century America is of course quite different from nineteenth century France, but certainly the battle lines often look similar: national ethnic identity versus ideals of human equality. When I walk through my neighborhood now and see \"No matter where you are from, we're glad you're our neighbor\" signs, I now think of Emile Zola. Trump feels a little bit like Boulanger, albeit minus all the military panache. It feels relevant, if only to normalize or universalize what the United States is going through now.Final nitpick: Mr. Brown could dial it back a little with the twenty dollar words (\"\u201cDo not be tempted by a twenty-dollar word when there is a ten-center handy, ready and able.\u201d --Strunck and White). It's a humanities book, so you get some leeway; but I think I have a pretty advanced vocabulary and I was looking up a word almost every other page, many of which were archaic, and there were some oddball phrases that seemed maybe British.

I have always thought I knew what it was about. Someone was stealing secrets from the French military and handing them over to the Germans. A note incriminating its author was found in a wastebasket by a cleaning woman and the French military got busy finding someone to blame it on.Not finding the traitor. Finding a man who could be presented to the public as a traitor. Who better to fill that role in 1890s France than a Jew. And so, with no evidence against him the French military convinced a court martial of the guilt of Alfred Dreyfus with faked evidence, with phony handwriting testimony (the one person who said the writing on the note was not Drefus' was not allowed to testify), and a secret forged document that was not revealed to the defense until years later.What really convicted Dreyfus was public opinion on which the military relied heavily. I did not realize how electric the atmosphere was at the end of the 19th century in France. After the loss to the Germans in the Franco-Prussian War and the civil war that erupted popular opinion divided into the few who thought France's military was simply not as good as Germany's and the many who thought the loss was punishment from God for . . . I don't remember what. It doesn't matter.The Roman Catholic church was in decline and struggling to re-attach its wandering former members who had been exposed to Ernest Renan's Life of Jesus and the German scholars who had been writing for decades that Jesus did not exist, that the Bible had no claim to authenticity, that Darwin had proven the Christian religion was based on lies. Mixed in with these disturbing discussions was a virulent resurgence of anti-Semitism in France. I read somewhere recently that if one were asked in 1900 to predict which country would take anti-Semitism to the extreme in the next 50 years Germany would be no one's guess. It would be France that was seen heading for trouble.I always thought that a few French army officers were protecting the guilty man when they rigged the Drefus decision. It turns out the guilty man was rather well known: Walsin Esterhazy. He eventually confessed, though that seems not to have convinced the partisans on the right of his guilt. The French military was so deeply corrupt there were almost no honest officers to protest Dreyfus' railroading.One man, Georges Picquart - remember his name - was put in charge of intelligence and realized Dreyfus' innocence. He went through channels trying to convince the military and the government that Dreyfus deserved a new trial. Not only did those above him not act on his evidence, he was shipped to a particularly dangerous assignment in Tunis in hopes he would be killed and when that didn't happen, he too was put on trial on false charges with faked evidence.Dreyfus' brother and a handful of others who were sure of his innocence worked for years to bring the truth to light. Eventually, like the military, they realized this was going to have to be tried in the court of public opinion. Zola wrote his famous J'Accuse and was found guilty of libel in another corrupt court and fled to England. Slowly, and it must have been slow indeed for the innocent man on Devil's Island and his family waiting for justice, the weight of evidence became sufficient to convince many open-minded people of Dreyfus' innocence. But still nothing was done because the military and government were so corrupt and they had the weight of such intense anti-Semitism on their side that they were able to prevent the re-opening of the case.Finally, in July of 1898 Godefroy Caviagnac was made minister of war and he realized the depth of the deception and the innocence of Dreyfus. So when the government demanded he state that there was no question of the man's guilt he resigned. So did the man who was named to replace him. And the man who was named to replace him. And slowly justice made her way, a new trial that found Dreyfus guilty, again with forged evidence, was overturned and he was freed.Frederick Brown's book presents the issues that polarized the French public in the late 19th century - the fall of a Catholic bank, the abandonment of de Lesseps' Panama Canal, the social disruption of the Communards after the Franco-Prussian War. Even the building of the Eiffel Tower was highly contentious. Eiffel was routinely described as an outsider, as German Jew (he was third generation French and not a Jew.) Brown shows how the strong feelings, not to say hysteria, of a polarized society led to the tragedy of the Dreyfus Affair and the subsequent weakening of the French Army, leading eventually to the French Army's capitulation to Hitler and the Vichy government."}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7099404-jeff", "userReview": "Every country has its internal clashes, and For the Soul of France by Frederick Brown illuminates the cultural divisions of the French Third Republic, 1870 - 1940. This erudite and fascinating work explores the internal struggles of Fin-de-Siecle France between the French military and Catholic Church on one side and Scientific community and Republican idealists on the other, culminating with the notorious Dreyfus affair. Religious and secular divisions, of course, are not unique to France, as western countries including the United States have been at swords-points between religious fervor and scientific rationalism. Yet, Brown hints--without directly stating--that this struggle may shed light on the brutal and genocidal anti-Semitism that typified the Nazi-sympathizing Vichy regime in German-Occupied France of the 1940's.The story opens with the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, which left parts of Paris in ruins and its population in starvation, and resulted in the explosive Commune, the short-lived revolutionary government controlled by working men, which deeply divided the working-class from those of clerical and aristocratic orders. With the Commune left in tatters and its members either shot or imprisoned, the stage is set for more fiery class and cultural divisions yet to come. The work also tells about such gargantuan figures as Gustave Eiffel, whose tower today is an undisputed icon of France--indeed its most recognizable monument--and the pains he endured to construct what was at the time the tallest manmade structure. However, according to Brown, French traditionalists largely rejected Eiffel's Tower as a metallic grotesquerie and a symbol of \"foreign\" intruders imposing cosmopolitan and secular values upon the Catholic country of Jeanne d'Arc, and that the edifice more befitted American sensibilities than Gallic ones. The author also delves into the scandal of the Panama canal; long before Teddy Roosevelt made it one of his signature achievements as President, the canal bridging the Atlantic with the Pacific was originally a French-financed project. But there is a reason why we know more about the Panama canal as a 20th century American enterprise than a 19th century French one, as Brown highlights the skeletons tumbling out of the closet in the French version of the canal project. But it is the Affair of Captain Dreyfus that reveals the depths of the fault-lines between religious and secular, and militaristic and scientific factions of French society. While not necessarily uncovering new developments of the ignominious \"affair\", Brown retells in exacting detail the astonishingly prejudicial efforts of pro-military and anti-Semitic elements to convict an officer of Jewish heritage on the slimmest proof of spying for Germany, on the grounds that Dreyfus, and his Jewish brethren, posed a genuine threat to French sovereignty and its Christian heritage. Those readers, particularly of the English speaking world, will most benefit from understanding the issues at stake in the Dreyfus debacle, leading to the famous newspaper opinion by Emile Zola called \"J'accuse.\" It is up to the reader to decide, after examining all the evidence brought to light in Brown's highly engaging and well-researched work, whether Zola's accusation was justified."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4626387-linda", "userReview": "To me, the worst episode in French history is the Dreyfus Affair. Alfred Dreyfus, Jewish only by birth, Captain in the French Army, was accused of being a traitor and, after a court martial based entirely on false and fabricated \"evidence,\" was sentenced to 4 years on Devil's Island off the coast of French Guiana. Eventually, enough noise was made (and the real culprit discovered) that Dreyfus was given a second court martial. The verdict, in spite of the new evidence AND the uncovering of the true culprit, was the same. The French President was finally persuaded to pardon him. Dreyfus, amazingly, returned to duty and eventually retired from the military.During the 19th century France vacillated among being a republic, a monarchy or an empire. Eventually she came to an uneasy rest on republic. Of course, those who favored monarchy or empire were disappointed and united to become the \"anti-republicans.\" Who cares what side they were originally on? They were united in NOT wanting a republic. This group touted conspiracy theories, scandals, you name it, to try to discredit the government. And Germany had nothing over France (until the 20th century) in its anti-semitism. Virtually anything that didn't turn out the way the antirepublicans wanted it to was the result of a Jewish conspiracy. The Panama Canal scandal was caused by Jews. Eiffel's horrible tower paid for by a Jewish cabal. Jews were responsible for the career end of General Boulanger, who should have been President and would have moved France back to where it should be. Jews also set fire (or rather, had bribed the people) to the Charity Bazaar, killing many upper class citizens, particularly women. You couldn't turn around without running into some sort of Jewish devilment, according to the antirepublicans.It all seemed to culminate in the Dreyfus Affair. The Army was corrupt and had been for most of the century; the Church was mightily resisting its separation from the State; antirepublicans saw Jewish conspiracies everywhere.This is a wonderful book describing how the culture of France during the 19th century \"caused\" the Dreyfus Affair, the embarrassment of the Army (and its eventual restructuring) and the final separation of the Catholic Church from the government of France. The author gives the history little by little, working up through the century, introducing people and events I had no idea about and somehow stuns you when the Dreyfus Affair occurs even though you know it's coming.Anyone interested in Zola (who wrote a famous newspaper article J'accuse which finally rattled the lid off the Affair), Alfred Dreyfus, or 19th century French history will be sure to enjoy this one."}, {"userName": "Louise Leetch", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2647549-louise-leetch", "userReview": "They say you should write about what you know and Frederick Brown certainly knows the French. The events he chronicles at the end of the 19th century lead us through the quest to discern what exactly constitutes the essence of France. Here is the saga of France\u2019s sojourn from Monarchy to Republic. The French revolution may have begun in 1789 but it was fought well into the twentieth century. The author picks up the tale at the Franco Prussian War in 1870. He gives us the events that shaped France into the country we now see; but what a convoluted tortured trip it has been. It\u2019s a miracle the Third Republic survived with attacks from left and right, economic disasters, and revolving door Premiers. As France struggled thru failed governments and the demi-gods who threatened, she constantly searched for a scapegoat. The Catholic Church and the Germans took their fair share of hits but the old standby, Jewry, bears the brunt of the attack. It\u2019s astonishing to see the anti-Semitic (a term newly coined in this period) vitriol\u2014worse still to see the popularity\u2014of partisan newspapers such as La Libre Parole. There will always be those who refuse to give up the past, praying for the return of a monarch, an emperor, insisting on France for the French. Luckily there were also those who challenged the old ways and the old religion and fought for free, secular education. Thiers, Clemenceau & Zola fought to build the Republic. The conservatives and royalists reawakened the symbol of Joan of Arc. Eiffel\u2019s tower sits in juxtaposition to Sacre Coeur. On one side the growth of technology and scientific thought. On the hill in Montmartre France\u2019s penance for the sins heaped upon her by the church.Read this book because you\u2019ll see the frightening similarities to the first ten years of the 21st century. There are all the lies, finger-pointing, invented evidence we\u2019ve seen since 2000. There\u2019s a lion\u2019s share of yellow journalism. Fear is the weapon of choice.

Anytime there is economic hardship, there is finger pointing as to the cause, and, invariably, the fingers are aimed at Jews.-As we read of the political sides where one wants the return of a monarchy and the other looks to the establishment of a republic; we also find that there was a schism caused by some who believed in the separation of Church and state (secularism) and the sanctity of the Church's influence. It seemed the country was on the verge of a civil war, and the only thing that calmed the atmosphere for a short while was a temporary truce brought on by the Paris World's Fair of 1889, where Gustave Eiffel presented his tower, but even that split the populace as some considered it an eyesore while others loved it's appearance.-The build up to the Dreyfus Affair was very enlightening. There was the collapse of the Union General, which was a fund specializing in Christian ventures and which rose quickly only to end in financial collapse. This was followed by the Panama Canal scandal, and focused on several Jews who helped to arrange for financing, but in doing so, came out with huge sums of money. After an inquiry, it was discovered that bribes were given out by them to get the financing done, and one, Dr. Herz, was discovered to be a con artist.-The Dreyfus Affair was a way to funnel the hatred of the people against the Jews. Evidence was forged, and perjury was done on a massive scale. Emile Zola, a famous writer who understood the injustice, put the full weight of his reputation to defend the Jews, and he himself was then put on trial and found guilty. The fighters for justice never gave up, despite the fact that even when the forgeries were discovered, many people in authority felt they were justified in order to put Dreyfus away.-Very interesting for the most part, but the writer, for my taste, could have done away with much of the beginning and the end, as I couldn't understand exactly what was happening in those sections.

Brown traces the role of the Church, the separation from state, the rise of Napoleon and mythology of the glory of war, alongside the rise of scientific rationalism and positivism, the blame of the partisan press on Jews for the failure of the Panama Canal, and the crash of the Union G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. The Dreyfus affair appears after the pillars of the beginning chapters outline the 1870 Franco-Prussian war, France's need to \"speechify\" and prove itself champion of \"liberty, the impresario of science and technology, the genial host clasping nations in a spirit of exuberant cosmopolitanism\". At odds with Universal expositions that supported this view, including critiques of the iconic Eiffel Tour, was the idea of a \"guarded, self-referential nation schooled in the imperative of war\" contained in Catholicism and nationalism. The penultimate chapter describing the catastrophe of the fire that burned the Charity Bazaar, reveals an increasing sense of the power of words to create and drive an agenda that has little to do with truth. Lively prose and copious notes and a few well-chosen illustrations support a complex history of 19th century France. The 60 pages about the Dreyfus affair include Zola's \"J'accuse\" give a thorough account of the unfairness of the anti-semitic set-up. The final chapter quotes Sainte-Beuve, as quoted by George Eliot in \"Impressions of Theophrastus Such\". \"Nothing collapse more quickly than civilization during crises like this one (1848); lost in three weeks is the accomplishment of centuries. Civilization, life itself, is something learned and invented. ... After several years of peace men forget it all too easily. They come to believe that culture is innate, that is is identical with nature But savagery is always lurking two steps away, and it regains a foothold as soon as one stumbles.\"How history repeats itself --"}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/426277-james", "userReview": "This is a history of ideas and of culture in France between the end of the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 and the end of the nineteenth century. It encompasses events ranging from the influence of the Catholic church on politics to the building of the Eiffel Tower and the unsuccessful attempt of De Lesseps to build the Panama Canal. One theme is scandals and there is a Banking scandal that rivals any in history.There is a chronology provided that lists the principal figures and events from the Paris revolts of 1848 until the death of Dreyfus in 1908. The Paris Commune in the Spring of 1871 is discussed, but there was also the longer-range political threat to the Republic came from the right leading to the tragicomic tale of the populist hero \u201con horse,\u201d Gen. Georges Boulanger, whose monarchist supporters urged him to lead a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Instead, he fled to Belgium and in 1891 committed suicide at the tomb of his mistress.The events depicted also include the crash of the Union Generale and a chapter on the famous tower and its engineer, Gustave Eiffel. (Eiffel\u2019s mother, he tells us, had to get him his first job, \u201cseeing in the person of her son an inert object that wouldn\u2019t move unless pushed.\u201d) Brown makes clear just how high the political and cultural stakes were in the construction of this \u201cogre of modernity\u201d; its architectural (and ideological) rival was the wedding-cake basilica rising on the other side of the Seine, the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur. But the culmination of the book and the moment that defines France more than any other as it moves forward into the next century is the Dreyfus Affair. With a chapter devoted to each of the events chronicled Frederick Brown's cultural history of France in the second half of the nineteenth century is an excellent introduction to the forces that shaped France in this period. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in French cultural history."}, {"userName": "Don", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/164842-don", "userReview": "The subtitle of the book is \"Culture Wars in the Age of Dreyfus\" and the book describes some of the virulent anti-semitism in France revealed by a couple of financial scandals and the Dreyfus affair. It also discusses anti-Republicanism and the attitude of the Catholic Church in the late 19th Century in France.What Brown does not do, however, is place any of this in a larger context. How prevalent was anti-semitism and anti-Republicanism? In the Dreyfus chapter, which is the centerpiece of the book, he initially creates the impression that anti-semitism was nearly universal in France. But then,the republican faction appears to prevail politically, leading to a new court martial for Dreyfus and an ultimate pardon. There is no discussion of any research regarding the extent of any of these trends. Moreover, other than anti-semitism, republicanism vs. anti-republicanism and religion vs. secularism, there is no discussion of \"culture\" in the sense of the arts, etc."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/958672-john", "userReview": "I'm tempted to rate this one 5 stars, but it wasn't quite amazing due to the many references to other history and culture of the time that I didn't get. Also, with long sections about uninteresting people (i.e. politicians) and the stupid things they did, it was a bit of a hard slog at times. In the end though, this book is exactly about the stupid things that people did, so it does a great job at explaining that. There are still parallels today as the culture wars continue in the US - progressive socialists vs conservative Christians. Sometimes it seems nothing has changed. In summary, this is a great history of the second half of the 19th century in France, and I look forward to finding out how it fits in with earlier and later periods."}, {"userName": "Kb", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1273396-kb", "userReview": "Stylistically, Brown is no David McCullough, but for this history consumer, the density was but a speed bump in what was ultimately an enjoyable read.

This book chronicles the culture wars that followed that defeat, which was between the conservative, Catholic, royalist right and the progressive, secular, republican left.

Intellectually nuanced, exquisitely written\u201d\u2014The New Republic) now gives us an ambitious, far-reaching book\u2014a perfect joining of subject and writer: a portrait of fin-de-si\u00e8cle France. He writes about the forces that led up to the twilight years of the nineteenth century when France, defeated by Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371, was forced to cede the border states of Alsace and Lorraine, and of the resulting civil war, waged without restraint, that toppled Napol\u00e9on III, crushed the Paris Commune, and provoked a dangerous nationalism that gripped the Republic. The author describes how postwar France, a nation splintered in the face of humiliation by the foreigner\u2014Prussia\u2014dissolved into two cultural factions: moderates, proponents of a secular state (\u201cClericalism, there is the enemy!\u201d), and reactionaries, who saw their ideal nation\u2014militant, Catholic, royalist\u2014embodied by Joan of Arc, with their message, that France had suffered its defeat in 1871 for having betrayed its true faith. A bitter debate took hold of the heart and soul of the country, framed by the vision of \u201cscience\u201d and \u201ctechnological advancement\u201d versus \u201csupernatural intervention.\u201d Brown shows us how Paris\u2019s most iconic monuments that rose up during those years bear witness to the passionate decades-long quarrel. At one end of Paris was Gustave Eiffel\u2019s tower, built in iron and more than a thousand feet tall, the beacon of a forward-looking nation; at Paris\u2019 other end, at the highest point in the city, the basilica of the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, atonement for the country\u2019s sins and moral laxity whose punishment was France\u2019s defeat in the war . . . Brown makes clear that the Dreyfus Affair\u2014the cannonade of the 1890s\u2014can only be understood in light of these converging forces. \u201cThe Affair\u201d shaped the character of public debate and informed private life. At stake was the fate of a Republic born during the Franco-Prussian War and reared against bitter opposition. The losses that abounded during this time\u2014the financial loss suffered by thousands in the crash of the Union G\u00e9nerale, a bank founded in 1875 to promote Catholic interests with Catholic capital outside the Rothschilds\u2019 sphere of influence, along with the failure of the Panama Canal Company\u2014spurred the partisan press, which blamed both disasters on Jewry.The author writes how the roiling conflicts that began thirty years before Dreyfus did not end with his exoneration in 1900.
