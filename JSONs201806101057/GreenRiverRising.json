I've read The Religion at least 5 times and finally have gotten my hands on another one of his books and I'm not disappointed. It is a 180 from The Religion but that's okay. Same argument as The Historian and The Swan Thieves. Two different books by the same author. Good deal. It's said this is the best prison story ever and I tend to agree. Mr. Willocks, a psychiatrist by day is nothing if not intense. No holds barred and nothing is ever held back. He is into realism, depicting human nature at it's worst as well at it's best and all points in between. The lines are drawn, and the bad are very bad and sometimes they get worse. Ahhh, but sometimes the monsters are not who they seem to be. The heart can be as vast and open as the sky even while being denied that sky. I highly recommend this book if this type of book appeals to you. Tim Willocks is one hellava writer."}, {"userName": "Nate", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6803829-nate", "userReview": "As this novel opens, Green River State Penitentiary is a pot of hatred and violence about to boil over. It\u2019s run by a megalomaniacal, unstable warden and packed with four cell blocks of angry men waiting for their chance to lash out--in short, not a place anyone in their right mind would want to be. Unfortunately, our hero Ray Klein is stuck in the middle of it, imprisoned on a false rape charge and with only days left to go on his sentence. When things go critical Klein is prevented from simply holing up in his cell by the presence of Juliette Devlin, a psychiatrist visiting the prison that he has (of course) fallen in love with.Every book I\u2019ve read by Willocks has been a variation on this admittedly powerful theme; a reluctant hero forced to brave an anarchic maelstrom of violence for the ones he loves. I think Willocks\u2019 most masterful use of this plot was probably in the ridiculously-gore-soaked Twelve Children of Paris, but this one certainly gives that book a hell of a run for its money. The author immediately throws us into this hellish world of racial hatred, squalor, and rape and like Klein we have to sink or swim. GRSP is wonderfully imagined and it takes no effort to visualize the settings, whether they be a birds\u2019 eye view of the entirety of its panoptic machinery or the myriad tunnels, cells, and rooms it contains.The characters are typically strong as per usual for Willocks. Aside from our heroes Klein and Devlin (a woman tough enough to earn the moniker \u201cmotherfucker\u201d from an admiring prisoner) we have a large cast of prisoners and staff both harmless and well-meaning and psychotically violent. I have to take issue with the couple reviews I\u2019ve seen online of this book calling it racist, because I\u2019m not sure if these people even read the book. There\u2019s a couple black antagonists but mostly it\u2019s the white dudes starting the shit--for god\u2019s sakes, the two Big Bads in the form of Warden Hobbes and Nev Agry are fucking white, and its the inmates of the white cell block that cause the most mayhem.I have to admit when I tried my first Willocks ( The Religion) I was confused and irritated by his style. He goes for broke with the ornamentation and artsy complexity with his prose (some would certainly call it purple) but is basically writing violent adventure thrillers. I used to think that art and entertainment were mutually exclusive, but how wrong I was. I remember comparing his work to Botticelli painting porn and I think that\u2019s a pretty good comparison. You get the chewy, ornate writing of the hated Literature with the full-throttle momentum and adrenaline of a gory action movie. What\u2019s not to like?! (Don\u2019t answer that.)"}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36734414-nick", "userReview": "Green River Rising is about a prison riot. It is violent, tough, has plenty of tension, a menacing atmosphere and great characters.It also happens to be my all time favourite five star book. It is the book I will never forget and the book that changed my life.Green River Rising was published in 1994 when I was 20 years old. I had not read a work of fiction for years. Reading books for enjoyment?!? Are you crazy? I had read books in my youth but not any more. Books are boring!I was (and still am) a big movie fan and Reservoir Dogs was my favourite film. It had introduced me to a whole new world of film. It also influenced many movies and books.I read a review of Green River Rising which placed it in the same vein as Reservoir Dogs (agree? disagree?) which got my attention. I went to my local book store (a strange unknown place to me) and there on display at the front was Green River Rising.The cover leapt out at me (the 1994 paperback cover is not on goodreads) and I immediately bought the book. I read it in a few days.I discovered a whole new world (book stores and finding secondhand books hidden in charity shops)and the pleasure of reading (all time classics and genre fiction).

A tratti bello ed entusiasmante con l'ambientazione carceraria riprodotta molto bene, a tratti troppo prolisso e di scrittura ricercata che \u00e8 al di fuori dell'ambientazione stessa e dunque e mal si mescola con la trama e a tratti decisamente fuori dalle righe per via: della profusione di sesso (quel troppo che stroppia e che risulta alla fine in alcuni personaggi come quello della dottoressa Devlin, inverosimile), linguaggio (mi sta bene che l'ambientazione lo impone, ma credo si sia esagerato) e la caraterizzazione del personaggio principale, che all'inizio pare anche troppo composto e alla fine sembra un'incarnazione di Rambo. Insomma l'dea e la storia del libro \u00e8 da apprezzare, anche la chiusura finale, anche se prevedibile ci sta bene, ma sembra che si sia voluto cuocere un pezzo di carne con troppo fuoco e troppa paprika, rovinandone in superfcie tutto il gusto.

However, a closer reading would find that this was far from the truth. I suspect those making the criticism haven't been within a hundred miles of the kind of institution upon which the Green River State Penitentiary is based. This reviewer hasn't either but if those depicted in any U.S. prison documentary that I have ever seen are half way near being true portrayals then this book certainly has the ring of truth. It's even been criticized for having a female character who likes sport - imagine that!There are no criticisms levelled at this book that could not also be levelled at movies such as Shawshank, Brubaker, Cool Hand Luke, American History X, Felon etc. and it is from such as these that the vast majority of readers will have taken their mental images of high security prisons in the U.S. It is not a documentary; it is fiction and should be taken at face value and in purely fictional terms that value is extremely high.The book is vividly plotted, the prose style mesmerizing and the characters three-dimensional but it is definitely not for the faint-hearted being as it is punctured, periodically, by unsavoury and brutal depictions of the bestiality inherent in human beings endeavouring to survive in the most nightmarishly vicious of environments: this is truly Darwinism in action.If you're looking for brilliantly realized drama of epic proportions that will keep you reading long into the night - you need look no further!"}, {"userName": "Joanne Parkington", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7572912-joanne-parkington", "userReview": "This book is superb .. i was torn between not being able to put it down & forcing myself to slow down as i didn't want it to finish ...

I've seldom read a book that paint's such a detailed description of it's setting that not only could i see the prison but i could smell it's sweat-soaked malice & taste it's rancid misery. I was frightend for these character's ... for Klein and Coley and the rest of the castaway's stranded in this version of Hell ... the one thing i couldn't shake was Marlon Brando's face every time i read about Hobbes, but as the author himself make's the comparison between his Warden & Colonel Kurtz it's hard not to. Are we also to think that Klein is the author's version of Captain Willard too ??Is Green River his Heart of Darkness ?? It's certainly dark ... it's also a nasty, violent and bloody enviroment where the predators stalk their designated patch's raping, maiming and stealing at will and paranoia & fear is all around.Teaming with frustration, graphically dirty, beautifully claustrophobic & strong with the stench of primevil base instinct ... a outstanding must read."}, {"userName": "Jag Garcia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10281354-jag-garcia", "userReview": "I first \"met\" Tim Willocks when I picked up a copy of The Religion at a book sale to read on the bus from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore.I enjoyed The Religion A LOT.
