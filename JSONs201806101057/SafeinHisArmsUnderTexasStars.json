In this story, readers get to know Margaret O'Brien, the best friend of Lucy Stanton from the previous book, \"Blue Moon Promise.\"I loved the character of Margaret. She is a strong, brave woman with opinions and ideas of her own, which was not alway well received back in the 1870s. She has a problem with her self-image - she doesn't feel she is attractive enough to find a husband. But when Daniel Cutler comes into her life, suddenly Margaret doesn't feel quite so plain after all. But can she trust a man who has so many secrets in his life? I love how Colleen pulls her readers deep into the heart of the story and how she intertwines a lovely romance with a bit of mystery and adds in a message of faith and hope as well. This is a delightful book that fans of historical fiction and inspirational fiction will enjoy.(I also got a kick out of Colleen's inclusion of one of the character's unseen girlfriend from Wichita Falls - my hometown!)"}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5396610-melanie", "userReview": "The cover is SOOOOOO gorgeous! :D"}, {"userName": "Lindsay Gassin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3775419-lindsay-gassin", "userReview": "A kidnapping, an attempted murder, a murder, a reunion with a wayward brother, a bank robbery, a tornado, a sprained ankle, another kidnapping, and a marriage proposal all in one day?

It seems like it has been a long time away from my blog but it has only been a few days. Maybe the reason that it has seemed like a long time is because I have been non-stop working throughout the entire weekend. I have been clearing land (yes, I even chopped down a tree) for my family\u2019s new house as well as working at my summer job. So, it has been quite hectic!Anyway, back to Safe in His Arms.I had high hopes for this book. I really wanted it to be good. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy it that much. I just did not like Margaret or Daniel at all. The whole story was just confusing, with too many things/characters going on at once.I am not at all trying to bash Colleen Coble. I will definitely try another book by her. I simply may have to try a different series.The main reason I did not like the book was Margaret. She seemed like a child. One minute she was nice to Daniel and then the next she was spitting fire at him. I was quite confused as to whether she liked Daniel or not, even at the end.The plot was also unclear. Daniel\u2019s story was a secret for way too long. I pretty much just got tired of it and simply wanted to finish the book.The cover was pretty. That is the main reason that this book intrigued me. I went to the library and looked through her books. I chose this book because I liked the cover the best\u2026from what I saw. I am going to give it 4 stars.As for the book, I am going to give it 2 stars. I did not enjoy it, and unfortunately am not going to recommend this novel. I would say to first time readers, like myself, to start with a different book. But, to all Colleen Coble fans who are reading this review, never fear! I will find another book and give her a second chance. Any recommendations?Title: Safe in His ArmsAuthor: Colleen CobleAuthor\u2019s Website: http://colleencoble.com/Reading Resolution: #14 (Denise Hunter is always recommending Colleen Coble\u2019s books so I decided to try one!)

There are some characters from the first novel, Blue Moon Promise, who appear in this novel as a supporting cast. The story takes place in Larson, Texas, in the year 1879.\tDaniel Cutler arrives at the Triple T ranch to take the job of foreman. He receives a cool reception from the ranch owner\u2019s daughter. She has been working as foreman for the last several years and doesn\u2019t need a man to come in and take over. Daniel has left his life of crime to become a Texas Ranger. He has come to the Triple T because his old gang is planning on robbing Larson\u2019s bank. Daniel has reappeared to his gang pretending to want to rejoin them, but in reality he is working with other Texas Rangers to arrest the gang. The Triple T foreman job is the perfect cover for him. Of course, no one on the ranch knows his real purpose in being there and he can\u2019t tell them in case they tell someone else and put their lives in danger. The owner\u2019s daughter, Margaret, is prickly as a cactus, but Daniel sees her for the beautiful woman she is inside and out. He not only has become a Texas Ranger, but a Christian as well. He soon falls for Margaret despite his intention to leave once his old gang is arrested. However, Margaret draws him like no other woman ever has. He believes God means for them to be together. Will Margaret be able to let down her defenses to let Daniel in? Will she allow God to be the One in whom she trusts?\tMargaret O\u2019Brien is a feisty, 28-year-old, spinster. She knows no man will ever want to marry her and she has accepted that. She is too tall and gangly with red hair. Men want small, dainty and blond women, right? What can Daniel possibly see in her? He must just be pretending to like her in order to get her to fall for him so he can marry her and get control of the ranch. Ranching is all Margaret has ever known and all she wants to do. She can outwork any man, and she has the knowledge to run the ranch all on her own. She needs no man to tell her what to do. Her father decides differently and that it is time for her to marry and give up ranching. Her father also changes his will, leaving the ranch to her cousin. When everyone finds out, Margaret feels wounded beyond belief. Someone else is angry too because her father is attacked, then the barn is burned down and her cousin goes missing. What is going on? Who is responsible for these crimes? Is it Daniel\u2019s old gang? Margaret has put her faith in her father, the ranch and herself as an O\u2019Brien for so long; she can\u2019t trust God to take care of her. Can Daniel show her she is loveable to God and to him? Will she believe him?\tThis is a wonderful story of coming to grips with a faith that must be put into action when the rubber meets the road. Seeing Margaret grow in her faith and in her worth through God\u2019s eyes was truly touching. This story has romance, mystery and action so you won\u2019t want to miss it!\tMy rating is 5 stars.Note: I received a complimentary copy for an honest review of this book.

I love romances with cowboys -- always have! Even though I've not read the first book in Coble's Under Texas Stars\u00a0series, as with many Christian fiction series, this book works well as a stand-alone read --\u00a0more so\u00a0than many other series I've read, in fact. Coble's writing is engaging and easy to read, and in addition to the love story, there is a bit of mystery to this novel, as well.I will admit this is one of those rare instances that I wish I still gave ratings in half-star increments. I probably would actually give this 3.5 stars instead of 4 stars -- 3 stars seemed too low since I did enjoy most of the story. I liked the feeling of satisfaction and contentment that I by the time I finished the book, but the romance was perhaps just a teeny bit too formulaic -- the handsome cowboy falls in love with a plain Jane who just can't understand why he would. I don't mind that storyline, but it is often hard to make it feel fresh with so many stories out there along those lines. And then you've got the action-packed last third of the book... Multiple incredible events occur so rapidly in such a short span of time, it is really just a bit too unbelievable -- exciting, but perhaps a little ridiculous, as well.With all Christian fiction, my basic requirement is that I don't want to be preached to. I suppose you could say, well, after all it is Christian fiction so what do you expect? \u00a0Nevertheless, it is possible to write an inspiring story without preaching. Thankfully, it seems fewer authors choose to preach and instead focus more on actual story-telling, but with definite Christian overtones and themes. Coble falls into the non-preachy category, so on that basis alone it was likely I would enjoy this book!\n\n\n  Read this book if you like...\n- Christian fiction that isn't too preachy- Historical fiction set in the early Western frontier- Books by Tamera Alexander, Kelly Eileen Hake, Janette Oke (and other authors whose books tend towards Western inspirational fiction)*Originally posted at Melissa's Bookshelf."}, {"userName": "Britney Wolfe", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10178134-britney-wolfe", "userReview": "Margaret O\u2019 Brien has lived on her father\u2019s ranch her whole life. As an only child growing up without her mother, Margaret dedicates herself to work on the ranch. She often dresses in men\u2019s clothing and doesn\u2019t take time to make herself more feminine. Margaret struggles with feeling self-conscious of her red hair and being tall. When Margaret\u2019s father makes the decision to hire on Daniel Cutler as the new foreman, Margaret is furious. Her father explains that he wants Margaret to get married and have children. When her father decides that Margaret\u2019s cousin will inherit the ranch instead of her, she begins looking in town for a job determined to be independent. Daniel Cutler doesn\u2019t know much about ranch life. The job at the ranch is just a cover as he infiltrates a gang of outlaws in the area, in order to try and persuade his brother to leave a life of crime. When Margaret overhears a mysterious conversation, she is led to believe that Daniel is an outlaw. Daniel wants to tell her the truth but cannot risk his plan being revealed. While Margaret is fighting for her inheritance, she learns about being beautiful in God\u2019s eyes, and falling in love. Daniel works to save his brother and win Margaret\u2019s heart. Together both learn a valuable lesson of resting in His arms. This book was wonderful to read. I found Margaret's character change intriguing. The story focuses on Margaret learning about her beauty and security in Christ. She has never seen herself as beautiful and does not try to acknowledge her femininity at all until her father demands she do so. A young lady who feels more comfortable in men's clothing, Margaret feels self-conscious of her looks. She also struggles with feeling inadequate as an independent woman, when her father insists that she marry and leave the ranch to which she has been essential to it's upkeep. I most liked how even though changes in Margaret's personality could be seen when feelings began to grow between her and Daniel, the complete change did not take place until she found her security in Christ. Only then did she accept the love that Daniel offered her. It is a common occurrence today that young girls try to find love and acceptance in humanly, worldly outlets which more often than not leads to more heartache. Safe in His Arms effectively conveys finding acceptance, purpose and love in God instead of in worldly wiles that pale in comparison."}, {"userName": "Vera Godley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6214962-vera-godley", "userReview": "b>My thoughts: Ranch life in the 1800s was not easy for man or woman, married or single. Opening the pages of Safe In the Arms we find Margaret O'Brien who is helping her father run the ranch. Margaret's mother died when Margaret was young and she has not had much female inflluence in her life. Her life has been that of the rough riding ranch hand - but she is the daughter of the owner of the ranch. She has worked hard to help her father keep the ranch going and building it to enviable status.Now dad hires a new foreman, Daniel Cutler and Margaret sees him as an intrusive, soft, non-rancher who possibly has a criminal background. The story has twists and turns around future ownership of the ranch when Dad decides he is going to leave the ranch to a male cousin and settle money on Margaret when she marries. His goal is to see her settled in the role of wife and mother. Margaret is headstrong as well as body-strong and she is hurt, befuddled, and very ill at ease with the situation.Then things really begin to happen and danger lurks.Author Colleen Coble has written an interesting historical story of the peoples and life on a Texas ranch in the 1800s bringing her characters to life and capturing our interest. Yes, I figured that the romance would happen and predicted its outcome. I did not, however, see the outcome of the danger and intrigue portions.

I know I have and still do! Safe in His Arms is a wonderful story about a girl named Margaret who experiences extreme insecurities because of her looks and because she is different from all the other women she knows. I could so relate to Margaret and her inner demons that she battled. The things that she thought defined her in a negative way were seen as positives by others.In Safe in His Arms from the Under Texas Stars series, Colleen Coble beautifully tells the story of Margaret and she makes this character become so real to you by the depth of emotions she gives her. I think any time that you can make people connect to a character on a personal level, you are going to have people adore your characters and you as an author!Safe in His Arms was such an extraordinary book on so many levels. Not only did it have deep emotion but there was also a complicated love story, a bit of a mystery and even murder and suspense. It\u2019s rare to find all of these things blended together so flawlessly in one book.I like a good love story but I need more than just the typical \u201cfluff\u201d that you find in them. Coble managed to strengthen her love story by the fact that it was not a stand alone theme. Her characters had more to them than met the eye and I love a story that I can\u2019t predict the ending to!I fell in love with Coble\u2019s writing when I reviewed Tidewater Inn and she has another winner with Safe in His Arms. I am so looking forward to what she comes up with next in this amazing series!"}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9317564-christina", "userReview": "Colleen Coble is one my favorite authors because she always keeps you on your toes and writes such amazing stories about people that you would love to meet and can truly identify with. Safe in His Arms was such a wonderful story about trust, forgiveness and acceptance. I so identified with Margaret and feeling like no one really saw her for who she was and having a difficult time accepting that God created her the way she was for a reason. She spent so much time comparing herself to others, that she missed the great gifts that God had blessed her with and also realizing that others did love her and see her for who she really was. She never felt worthy of love and always assumed that no one would see her for her true self. When Daniel walked into her life, he turned her world upside down. Daniel was not at all what he seemed and yet he was every bit the man he showed in the little things he did for Margaret. He looked into her heart and saw the vulnerable woman desperate for love and longed for her to see herself the way that he did but more importantly, the way that God saw her. I don't want to give too much away because I really and truly loved this story and think everyone should read it. It is a story of 2 people who have real struggles. They also face many trials and in the end they must decide to take a leap of faith and trust God. Please read this story!

Maggie O'Brien doesn't fit anyone's image of what a woman should be. Yet Daniel Cutler thinks she's beautiful, something she just can't accept --especially when she's convinced he's a bank thief. This historical romance and mystery winds around the deep truth that God loves us unconditionally, a truth that can transform our lives if we let it.

Following Margaret as our protagonist was initially hard to swallow as she wasn't portrayed as the nicest gals in the previous novel, Blue Moon Promise. However, under that tall and strong skin was a woman who thought she was unloveable, even to God, and only wished to gain others' approval, in particular her father's. As a teenage girl once myself, I understood and immediately bonded with her over her insecurities, especially with her feminine attractiveness. She just couldn't believe that any man would ever want her, and the only guy she thought would even consider marriage to her had fallen in love with a beautiful, dainty girl whom Margaret now called a best friend. In came Daniel. It was hard to determine what he was up to in the beginning. The way Coble described his secretive plans for being in the town of Larson made him seem very sketchy indeed. I wasn't certain if he was fully a good guy or not, or if his past was truly catching up to him.Their attraction to each other felt natural. It may have started off as admiring the others' outlook, but it became over time a product of mutual respect and reliance on one another. I loved the way Daniel got under Margaret's defenses and tried to show her that she was a beautiful woman, inside and out. At the same time, the string of robberies around Larson and the secretive nature of Daniel's ties to them were brewing and had me on the edge of my bus seat to determine how it could possibly end well for all of them.The mystery wasn't a huge highlight in the novel, and it did take a drastic turn that became predictable right before the end. However, I have to say that Colleen Coble's done it again with amazing me with her amazing storytelling skills. I don't really enjoy historical novels all that much, but with her? I absolutely adore them. That in itself already says a lot about this book.Overall Recommendation:Margaret was immediately a well-rounded character that I could easily connect with on her insecurities and wish to be loved and respected by the predominantly male characters in her life. Daniel was the perfect mix of a gentleman and mystery, with a dangerous past linked to his reasons for being at Margaret's ranch. I loved the setting of Safe in His Arms and the overall lessons that Margaret had to learn about herself. The romance was absolutely a delight, and well-loved characters from the previous novel definitely make an appearance here too. I would most definitely recommend this cute duo series.-----------------------------------------------------------For more of my reviews, please check out my website Down the Rabbit Hole:"}], "description": "Sometimes it takes a stranger to see you as you really are.Born and raised on sprawling Texas land, Margaret O\u2019Brien prides herself on her competence as a rancher.
