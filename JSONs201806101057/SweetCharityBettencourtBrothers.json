Charity still wants Gabe but he just wants to be friends. Gabe likes his sex rough and kinky and he feels that Charity is too nice to be able to accept his sexual desires. The more he pushes her away the more determined Charity becomes to have him for herself. When Gabe finally gives into her, the sex is hot and Charity loves every minute of it. Very sexy and passionate story."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3074479-melissa", "userReview": "Okay so I have been on a Lauren Dane kick lately and I think it's because I can always count on her books to give me a sweet smile. I really liked this one, I wish this novella and the one before it were a tad bit longer. I think both of them would do great full length. Oh and I would also would like Brian's story...sighI think Lauren Dane has great talent and I'm looking forward to reading more from her.4 stars"}, {"userName": "Estara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3590834-estara", "userReview": "This is as good as the Chase Brother series by Lauren Dane, but doesn't have a suspense subplot and is much shorter. I LOVED the fact that there was so much about the supportive families of both characters and that they were strong and quite able to have happy lives without each other.I did think the conflict of the hero was idiotic pretty much after the first half of the story, as the heroine had already made it vocally clear that she was fine with what he wanted.I grinned at the fact that in this short romance the HERO runs off at the end because he's insecure of what he wants and the heroine comes after and sets him to right. Nice switch of clich\u00e9s there."}, {"userName": "Kaylea Cross", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3164934-kaylea-cross", "userReview": "Really enjoyed this book. Ms. Dane has a beautiful voice, and the dynamic between the hero and heroine really worked for me. I especially loved the natural and very real feel to the dialogue. The family scenes were described in a way that really worked for me--usually I get bored with that sort of information thrown into a book, but Ms. Dane wove it in there in a way that made me feel warm and fuzzy all over. I was very relieved when Gabriel came to his senses at the end of the story! I'll definitely be reading more of Ms. Dane's books this weekend."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1262425-jessica", "userReview": "What I really enjoy about Lauren Dane's writing is that she can flesh out supporting characters and a small town like more \"chick lit\" or classic contemporary romance authors (Higgins, Dahl, SE Philips), but still write excellent sex scenes between two (or more!) intelligent, encouraging, self-knowledgeable, and caring partners. She's just a delight to read and a great step up in quality for those who liked Fifty Shades and want more erotica."}, {"userName": "Jordan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21926328-jordan", "userReview": "This felt trite. And... Ugh. There are so many things about how the hero and heroine behaved and treated each other that I'm not okay with. This need to decide for each other and punish each other... :(This also needed some edits. This author's earlier works are too often full of comma splices. Semi colons and conjunctions are fabulous things. As are well appointed periods.
