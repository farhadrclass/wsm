The novel is centred around the Espejo family in El Paso, Texas in 1967. It is told from the changing and contrasting viewpoints of all the characters. Early on in the book, there's a line that describes humans beings as our own separate countries, with our own languages, and how we spend our entire lives trying to translate each other. S\u00e1enz use of metaphors like this and poetic language to make this book amazingly thought provoking."}, {"userName": "Ryan Mishap", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap", "userReview": "Early in, I read this exchange between the dying grandmother, Rosario, and the youngest child, Charlie: \"No, amor, it's not fair. All countries are cruel. You must always remember that.\" He thought about his globe and all his maps. \"Isn't there any place we can go?\" \"Someday we will do away with countries. We'll be better off without them, amor.\"I knew I was in a good book.September, 1967, and the Espejo family of El Paso, TX is waiting; for Rosario to pass on only one thing among many. Lourdes, the daughter-in-law and mother to three children, postpones her dreams to tend to Rosario, but she watches her children with love, especially Gustavo. He's waiting for the final draft notice that will mean he is going to Vietnam. Long haired and calling himself a Chicano, Gustavo doesn't want to go to war, but the reasons why are far more complicated than cowardice, which is what his dad, Octavio, suspects. Meanwhile, his twin sister, Xochil, contemplates going on to college, the pull of straight arrow Jack Evans--who is for the war and enlisted--, and what her brother will do. Charlie, innocent, good-natured, thirteen year old Charlie, tries to figure out what is happening to their family.The point of view shifts as this family heads for possible dissolution. Along the way, Saenz touches on multiple issues from varying points of view. This is a very good political novel--and don't be scared away from that word because every novel worth reading is political.Two events/actions didn't sit right with me, one involving Xochil's fear of alleys, else I would give this five stars."}, {"userName": "Jules", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5330044-jules", "userReview": "There's a line early on in the book that describes human beings as our own separate countries, with our own languages, and how we spend our lives trying to translate each other. Saenz uses the countries of Mexico, America, and Vietnam as a framework to explore family relationships in this book, namely the Espejo family, exiles of the Mexican revolutionary war, who find themselves caught in the shadow of the Vietnam war as America's youth are drafted to fight. Saenz's prose is uncomplicated, direct, emotionally naked, and deceptively simple. His characters are complex individuals, and he writes from every perspective of the family, and contrasts their situation with a grunt in basic training and a marine in combat. Saenz understands how family itself can be a kind of warfare, with roles dug deep in the trenches, sometimes yielding to advances, sometimes dug too deep to ever yield."}, {"userName": "Dorinda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1798336-dorinda", "userReview": "This book took me longer than usual to read because it requires reflection and appreciation for the language. Saenz' skill as a poet makes it that much better a read. Written in 2008 and set in 1967 it is a consideration of war both now and then. He recreates the pain of 1967 and Viet Nam and confronting the few choices in regard to fighting so clearly that it put me right back there. That recreation of that time was part of the reason for slow going through painful memories. Some of my questions about why go back to that time in 2008 are answered in the author's essay at the end of the paperback edition. I recommend reading the edition with that essay but do not read it until after reading the novel.

A political novel dealing with the social ramifications of the Vietnam war. As expected from S\u00e1enz, all this is compartmentalized into a Mexican family living close to the border. I was suprised/disappointed at the plot development which pretty much picks up only at the very last 50 pages. The synopsis says Gustavo\u2019s fleeing \u201csets into motion a series of events\u201d. The so-called \u201cseries of events\u201d unravels in the last 30, 20 pages.

E il momento \u00e8 arrivato. Non so perch\u00e9, ma ogni volta che leggo un libro di S\u00e1enz, dopo mi sento strana e cambiata. In senso buono, ovviamente. Non so, i suoi libri hanno qualcosa di particolare che non riesco ad individuare, perch\u00e9 sono tutti molto diversi.Parlando in particolare di Names on a Map, siamo sul confine tra Texas e Messico alla fine degli anni '60. La famiglia Espejo \u00e8 dovuta fuggire dal Messico a causa della rivoluzione, ed ora il nuovo paese richiede un tributo. Gustavo, il figlio maschio maggiore, riceve la lettera per andare a combattere in Vietnam. Solo che non vuole. E la sua scelta cambia irrimediabilmente le dinamiche familiari.There are days when I almost forget that I fought inthat war. It was such a long time ago. I was young, so young, sofucking young. And all that's left of my youth is in my head. Youknow, the head, it's like a map. Not a map that gives you directions,but a map with names on it\u2013names of guys who werekilled in the war, names of the people you left behind, names ofcountries and villages and cities. Names. After all these years,that's all that's left. Names. But no directions. And no way toreach them, no way to get back what you lost.Durante il romanzo seguiamo sia la famiglia Espejo sia alcuni dei ragazzi che hanno scelto, al contrario di Conad e Gus, di andare in Vietnam a combattere. Prima di parlare di Gus, Xochil, Charlie, Lourdes e Octavio, vorrei soffermarmi su Jack e sugli altri ragazzi che sono partiti. Rispetto ai legami familiari degli Espejo, questi ragazzi sono una parte un po' marginale. Ma mi ha colpito come S\u00e1enz ha scritto di loro. Da una parte c'\u00e8 l'ignoranza di Jack Evans. Convinto di servire la patria, di combattere per i diritti degli Americani (in Vietnam devi andare, per salvaguardare i diritti dei cittadini Americani? Figlio mio, ma ti stai a sentire?), chiama Comunista Gus quando questi si dice contrario alla guerra e mostra di non sapere neanche il significato della parola \"Comunismo\". Non sa cosa significa essere davvero un uomo, e pensa che prendere un fucile e sparare senza sapere il motivo reale lo render\u00e0 tale. In un certo senso ho avuto piet\u00e0 di lui. Non pensa con la sua testa, e fa solo ci\u00f2 che il padre e uomini pi\u00f9 anziani gli dicono sia giusto fare. Adam e Abe sono gi\u00e0 nei Marines, ad essere addestrati e a combattere. E attraverso di loro vediamo quanto la guerra li abbia condizionati e cambiati. Capiamo quanto siano davvero troppo giovani e insperti, come non sappiamo nulla. E come il loro essere fieri di essere l\u00ec a combattere, di essere finalmente dei Marine, alla fine non vale nulla. Hanno perso tutto, e una parte di loro \u00e8 rimasta in Vietnam.Come ho detto \u00e8 una parte minima, ma l'ho trovata estremamente interessante.Per quanto riguarda invece gli Espejo, \u00e8 una famiglai complessa, in cui le dinamiche vengono messe in gioco a causa della guerra.Octavio, il padre, \u00e8 un uomono fallito. A tratti l'ho trovato patetico. Non riesce a creare un rapporto con il figlio, e per qualsiasi cosa d\u00e0 la colpa ad altri. Non riesce a vedere che la causa del malessere \u00e8 lui. Non \u00e8 lui ad essere la vittima. \u00c8 cos\u00ec diverso rispetto a Gus e a Charlie, e non prova neanche a comprenderli. Specialmente Gus. Lourdes \u00e8 una madre protettiva, che farebbe qualsiasi cosa per i figli. Lei \u00e8 quella che ascolta, che osserva, che comprende. Prende molta responsabilit\u00e0 su di se, ma deve farlo per forza a causa del marito. \u00c8 un personaggio che mi \u00e8 piaciuto davvero molto. Una donna forte, ci sono dei momenti in cui vediamo davvero quanto sia terrorizzata per il figlio. E sono quelli i passi del libro che ho trovato pi\u00f9 belli.Gus e Xochil sono gemelli, due parti di un unico. Ma entrambi hanno le loro storie e le loro vite da vivere, che sono molto diverse. Se Gus ha il problema della guerra, del non voler andare, Xochil vuole una vita propria, che non sia scelta a causa delle aspettative della famiglia. Un'esistenza che sia davvero sua. Entrambi i gemelli mi sono piaciuti molto, cos\u00ec diversi eppure cos\u00ec simili. Durante il romanzo li vediamo cambiare, evolversi. Capire chi sono davvero. Charlie \u00e8 l'ultimo, il pi\u00f9 \"americano\", e il pi\u00f9 idealizzato. Anche lui cambia nel romanzo, e forse il suo cambiamento \u00e8 meno sottile rispetto ai fratelli maggiori.Vedere i legami tra i membri della famiglia Espejo rompersi e ricostruirsi diversamente \u00e8 stata un'esperienza che non dimenticher\u00f2 facilmente. \u00c8 qualcosa di quasi tangibile, e scritto in un modo magnifico. Lo stile di S\u00e1enz \u00e8 estremamente particolare, e non so neanche come spiegarlo, in effetti. Particolare e vivo. E le sue storie fanno sempre pensare molto.A questo punto, S\u00e1enz si riconferma davvero come uno dei miei autori preferiti, e spero di poter leggere presto He forgot to say goodbye."}, {"userName": "Hazel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2312406-hazel", "userReview": "I cannot say enough times how much I love this author.

I though the author would write more about the effects of the son choosing to dodge the draft of Vietnam. However, it was more about family relationships.

But when the eldest son, Gustavo, a complex and errant rebel, receives a certified letter ordering him to report to basic training, he chooses to flee instead to Mexico. Retreating back to the land of his grandfather\u2014a foreign country to which he is no longer culturally connected\u2014Gustavo sets into motion a series of events that will have catastrophic consequences on the fragile bonds holding the family together.Told with raw power and searing bluntness, and filled with important themes as immediate as today\u2019s headlines, Names on a Map is arguably the most important work to date of a major American literary artist.My ThoughtsLike everything else I\u2019ve read by Benjamin Alire S\u00e1enz, Names on a Map does not disappoint. He tells a captivating story that is simultaneously beautiful and devastating. For me, reading one of his books is always a deeply moving experience. Recently, I heard the term brutiful used to describe something that is both beautiful and brutal at the same time. While brutiful certainly doesn\u2019t do justice to the aesthetic or lyricism of S\u00e1enz\u2019s writing, I think the idea of the word captures an important aspect of what makes his work so outstanding. For those familiar with S\u00e1enz\u2019s other novels, you may find his characters here comfortingly familiar as they seem to have pieces of Sammy, Gigi, Aristotle, and Dante, among others.As we\u2019ve explained in earlier posts, we\u2019re alternating between young adult and adult novels this year for our book group. Our young adult book reviews focus on how and why a particular book could be used with students. We want our adult reviews to have a similar educational focus, but perhaps more on how and why a book is a valuable reflective experience for educators. So, while there\u2019s much I could say about Names on a Map, I\u2019m going to focus on the themes that I hope will be the most relevant to the topics of conversation we have as educators.A highly character-driven novel, S\u00e1enz tells his story through the alternating points of view of the Espejo family and other members of their El Paso community. Revealing the climax of the story early, S\u00e1enz focuses on the characters\u2019 struggles for self-understanding. One review critiques this, arguing that \u201cS\u00e1enz deftly captures a mood, but his obsession with introspection bloats the family story.\u201d I disagree. I think this is an essential piece to what makes it such a beautiful book. Self-reflection, introspection, and mindfulness are things our society seems to struggle with more and more. Just think about the large number of recent self-help bestsellers that are about mindfulness. While there is obviously something here that we are grappling with as a society, there\u2019s little if any conversation about how to teach our students these skills or how this can impact the practice of education. Interestingly, studies have linked student success to the amount of time teachers have to reflect on how and what they\u2019re teaching. The more time for reflection the more successful students are. It\u2019s not surprising that the U.S. tends to rank at the bottom in terms of the amount of time teachers are given for such reflection. If we find S\u00e1enz\u2019s emphasis on reflection uncomfortable, perhaps we should ask ourselves why that is.It is the introspective nature of S\u00e1enz\u2019s characters that safeguards against oversimplifying what was a complex period of U.S. history. There\u2019s no question where S\u00e1enz stands on the Vietnam War. In the back matter he shares that he wanted to write a political book, and he did. And it\u2019s a compelling one. But while he clearly is making a point, he does it without demonizing anyone. It was a complicated time in the U.S. People were part of the collateral damage\u2014both those who died and those who survived. While he offers a critique of those who seemed to unquestioningly accept the patriotism of supporting the Vietnam War, he also offers a very compassionate picture of the young men sent to fight that war. He shows all the shades of grey that make war anything but a black and white issue. He finds a way to humanize everyone without weakening his own critique of the war. He speaks truth with grace and shows the value in understanding why people are the way they are and why they do what they do. Yet, at the same time he makes a strong argument for recognizing one\u2019s agency. One of my favorite quotes is a series of reflective questions asked by Gustavo and Xochil\u2019s mother: \u201cThat\u2019s what my life had become? Become? Was it as passive as all that? Were we as stationary as trees in the wind? Did we just let life take us along as if human beings were no more sentient than the water a river swept to the sea?\u201d (p. 96).There are also a number of connections that can be made between contemporary discussions around immigration and the role immigration plays in the novel. Immigration has an important historical role in Names on a Map as the older generations reflect on the ways in which they have changed as a result of Mexican immigration to the U.S. during the Mexican Revolution. Many of them immigrated as refugees from the violence of the Revolution. Decades later they continue to think of themselves as living in exile. This affects not only the ways in which they engage with society and younger generations, but their own personal psychology and identity. This is significant because it can expand and complicate in important ways how we think about immigration today.We don\u2019t often think about how the history of immigration in a family continues to affect future generations, but we should, especially in light of the numbers of unaccompanied minors travelling from Central America and the refugee crisis in Europe. What are the effects of inheriting exile? As Octavio, the father, ponders: \u201cYou remember what your father said when he was forced to leave Mexico, forced to leave the only piece of earth he\u2019d ever love. Todos somos hu\u00e9rfanos en este maldito mundo. Orphans all of us in this cruel and breaking earth\u201d (p. 229). Then, later Gustavo, the son, realizes, \u201cYour grandfather lost everything, his land, his riches, his country. Your father inherited exile\u201d (p. 273). This is the reality of a growing number of our students. Sadly, what Gustavo says is true for too many children: \u201cIn the end, you will always be a child of war\u201d (p. 302). I\u2019ll close with a quote that I think is important for all of us who work with children to consider. As Gustavo\u2019s mother struggles with the possibility of losing her son to the draft for the Vietnam War she reflects, \u201cBut if I had to make a choice between a country and my son, then I would choose my son. . .I did idealize my children. I thought they were all beautiful enough to save. All of them.\u201d (p. 310). For me, this is a powerful thought. What if all of us who worked in some capacity with children believed they were ALL beautiful enough to save, and we were willing to choose saving them over all else?For access to the full review and additional resources, check out our Vamos a Leer blog at teachinglatinamericathroughliterature.com."}, {"userName": "Marian", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1306450-marian", "userReview": "I don't know if I can articulate why this book is so special to me. Part of it is the fluidity and beauty of the writing. I think there is something to Spanish-speaking writers that lends itself to poetry. But it is beyond that. This books lyricism felt personal, like I cared beyond the eyes of a critic and just felt the words. Part of the reason I love this book is because of who the three siblings --- Gustavo, Xochil and Charlie --- are, individually and to each other. It is maybe too impossible, that they should be what they are described to be and love each other as they do. But they are impossibly beautiful people and I find myself loving them. They are inadequate and quiet with each other, utterly devoted and yet constantly finding themselves at distances. It feels desperately sad, that distance. This book is about war and it is also about family. What war does to women, what it does to children, and what it does to young men. What war does to relationships and love itself. It derides - rightfully - the unexamined acceptance of a country's war. It derides the gendered representation of soldiers as men. As masculine.

It's about a Mexican American family during the Vietnam War and the individual struggles put on them by this war that they are largely disconnected from in different ways. It's an extremely introspective book - the entire 400+ pages takes place over only a few days. It's a different kind of war novel, focusing more on inner battles than the outer. It says a lot about the Vietnam War by rarely bringing us to the Vietnam within the story. It says a lot to about Mexico without bringing us to Mexico. I, personally, as a white person who's lived her entire life in the northeast of America, have never really considered Mexico, Vietnam, and Texas as three places together that have stories that entangle with each other- which is completely ignorant. As books should, this book expanded the plane of history, of people, and of the world in my mind. And as someone who also has never been closely affected by war, I found this book very insightful and made me consider things I might not be inclined to when faced with the topic of war, violence, and politics in general.As I said, this book is slow, but I really enjoyed it for its introspection and characters. It was not a happy book, and there were times that I did feel bored, but mainly that had to do with the fact that I preferred certain character POV's over others. This book is not a thriller, and there is no physical action- but it's a thinker.Characters: This book is all about voices. The characters, most coming from a single family, are extremely diverse in their personalities and beliefs. The story focuses on the Espejos, a soldier in bootcamp, and a soldier in Vietnam itself. I loved that there was no single character that I agreed with completely, and no single character that I didn't. The characters in this book really exemplified the differences in human perceptions of honor, weakness, of manhood, womanhood, goodness and badness and war- and that in the end, there is no right or wrong, but only our own choices. And in the political climate we live in today (and any period of history), it really made me think. This book was full of very strong characters.Writing: Before this book, I don't believe I'd ever read a book that has every kind of point of view- first, second, third limited, and third omniscient. This one does. Normally, I feel as if I might not be a fan of this, but this author really manages to pull it off. Since this is a book all about voices, I found it very appropriate and loved the symbolism of it. The writing is very beautiful and truthful, if a bit wordy at times. I enjoyed the poetic quality of it.Was I satisfied? Yeah! This book made me more aware of the larger world and a part of history I haven't given as much time to as others, considering I love history so much.

I used to feel compelled to always finish any book that I started, but as I've gotten older, I've realized that life is too short and there's too many great books out there to waste your time on the mediocre ones. The characters were cliched, and the publisher's description doesn't really match the book. At least not as of 50% into it. Maybe later the author came up with some surprises, but after reading my fellow goodreaders' reviews, I don't think so. I think it would be a great book for YAs who could learn about the generational, cultural, and family divides during the Vietnam war in an entertaining way, because it does represent those ideas. It also gives some insight into immigrants and the children of immigrants. But I just felt the same subject has been covered before and in not such a simplistic, cliched way."}, {"userName": "Alicia", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/255516-alicia", "userReview": "Names is the story of one week in 1967 that brings momentous change to the Espejo family. When a draft notice is delivered to the oldest son, Gustavo, he is forced to chose between disappointing his father and following his conscience. Mirroring the turmoil that infects El Paso and the nation, each family member's reaction to this event shapes the story of their lives. The alternating viewpoints give you a complete picture of each family member and the why the decision each makes has such an impact on the character and the family.Novels written by poets almost always make me happy. I love stopping and looking out the window at the green, sunlit world (assuming it is out there) and thinking about a beautiful turn of phrase or a stunning description. Some days that is really all I need to have a worthwhile day."}, {"userName": "Jurri Saddler", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24901080-jurri-saddler", "userReview": "This is the first book of Benjamin Alire Saenz I read that didn't fall under the young-adult literature category. It was my hope to read books outside of my comfort zone. I am a young-adult lit junkie and I thought I would test the waters with a writer I greatly admire. I am glad I did.Saenz yet again delivers a book that genuinely moves the reader. The deliverance of some of the lines and images throughout the book caused me to physically ache. It such a moving a novel about the complexity that individuals and their families can face. Add to that the climate of war and beliefs surrounding war, one has the necessary ingredients to create a compelling novel. Saenz did just that and I believe it is one of those books that will haunt me in a beautiful way for the rest of my life."}, {"userName": "Tracy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/965583-tracy", "userReview": "This is a book for people who love good storytelling. Set in El Paso, TX & Vietnam in the late 60's, it mostly follows the impact the war has on the Espejo family. Each chapter focuses on a different character or set of characters. You can tell this was written by someone who also writes poetry. Some chapters are only 2 pages long, packing their meaning into spare words. The thing I loved most was how Saenz uses the 1st, 2nd & 3rd person, and it's never the same for any given character. In every case, the choices he made as to which point of view to use is right on target. A wonderful piece of writing."}, {"userName": "Bianca Vega", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2589519-bianca-vega", "userReview": "Wow. I had a hard time at the beginning trying to ascertain the plot line of this, and then it hit me like a ton of bricks. This novel forces you to confront the notion of war and its effect on all types of people. In particular, this novel looks at how the Vietnam War affected a Mexican family in El Paso Texas who had been driven out of Mexico due to the Mexican Revolution. Although the novel focuses on one particular young man's decision, it also briefly looks at other decisions and choices made by young men of that time. It's heartbreaking, soul wrenching, and thought provoking...just as war should be."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5472466-teresa", "userReview": "I cannot stress how much of a great writer Benjamin is! I have fallen in love with his writing style.Names on a Map was the first book I ever read written by him. I will admit, the various \"points of view\" are a little hard to keep track of, mainly because there are so many (I had to go back a few times to get m characters straight) but overall I believe it was beautifully written.

The story is told from the point of view of members of his family, his friends, and himself. Each chapter is written in one of their voices. Each voice gives a different take on being Mexican-American, the Vietnam war, and the relationships between the characters.
