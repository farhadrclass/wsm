Isabela is 78 years old and mother to Celia and Ninexin. She and her husband Ignacio raised Maria, because Ninexin was a freedom fighter in the Nicaraguan revolution and then became a government minister too busy to raise a child by herself. Ninexin's husband Manuel died in the revolution.Maria is now manager of an art gallery in New York city and living with Allen, a painter who is more interested in his paintings than Ninexin. Ignacio dies and all three women come together for his funeral. There is a lot of emotion between the three women and I could not read more than 10-15 pages a day, because it was such an emotional book. I even stopped reading it for a few days to give my brain a rest. Think of the movie \"Terms of Endearment\" with its mother daughter issues. Isabela also pines for the man, Mauricio, that she wanted to marry but was stopped at the altar by her parents. Some quotes: Ninexin on her relationship with Maria(Mariana) \"I lose Mariana again every time I see her and I never seem to get any better at it.\"Maria talking about her grandfather: \"...whose soul, Dona Olga said, is supposed to be hovering for the next forty days.\"Isabela:...if you live long enough, you start to lose the need to please everyone else all of the time.\"I liked the descriptive Nicaraguan atmosphere--myths, description of wildlife, colorful houses and kind people. The healing process begins about 2/3rds of the way in and by the end, there is peace for all three women. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if it was not so far out of my usual reading genres--mystery/biography/history. I would classify this book as women's fiction.Isabela has some laugh out lines in the final third of the book.I rate it 3.5 stars(rounded up to4) out of 5 stars.Thanks to the publisher for sending me this book through the Goodreads Giveaway program.My wife just read this book and she rates it a solid 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Jessica Howard", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78086-jessica-howard", "userReview": "If I'm honest, and I was judging books by their covers, I never would have picked up The Ladies of Managua. But Shelf Awareness sent it to me for review, and I REALLY enjoyed it! It's a family saga set in Nicaragua, telling the story of 3 women.1. Isabela, the grandmother & high society lady. 2. Ninexin, the mother, former Sandinista revolutionary, current government minister. 3. Maria, the daughter, a would-be artist who has escaped her family's tangled history to live in NYC, until her grandfather's death calls her back to Managua. \u202aFull review for Shelf Awareness soon."}, {"userName": "Fiona", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6084788-fiona", "userReview": "Fascinating story.Three generations of women meet at Abuelo\u00b4s (Ignacio) funeral in Granada, Nicaragua. There\u00b4s Isabela, the grandmother & widow of Ignacio, Ninexin, their daughter who is a Sandinista and current government official, and Mariana (or Maria, for short) who is the third generation and Ninexin\u00b4s grown daughter. Each women has a secret that is revealed during their reunion.Isabela\u00b4s great love was not her husband, but Mauricio whom she met while in high school at Sacred Heart in New Orleans. They had planned to elope but her father found out about the wedding and stopped it. She returned to Nicaragua and eventually marrying Ignacio. Ninexin was a Sandanista revolutionary whose husband, Manuel, was also a revolutionary. He was shot and killed on mission during the war. Ninexin had her baby, Mariana, shortly before the shootout. For her daughters safety, she allowed her parents to take Mariana to Miami to raise her. She has never felt close to her daughter and is jealous of the closeness between Isabela and Mariana.Maria (as she goes by now) is an artist working in an art gallery in NYC. She has a boyfried, Allan, who followed her to Nicaragua much to the surprise of everyone. She is also pregnant.This novel is told through the eyes and thoughts of all three women. Each chapter is named for one of them and the story progresses through her. Great story of \"the one great love\" in our lives and the love shared between mothers/daughters/grandmothers. Wonderful story. I didn\u00b4t care too much for the ending but I see a sequel in the making."}, {"userName": "Melissa Lindsey", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5724597-melissa-lindsey", "userReview": "This was such a fun read! Told from the perspective of three different generations, the novel centers around the complicated family relationships that make for great reading experiences. Each chapter allows readers to hear from the voices of a grandmother, daughter, and grand-daughter as they meet together for the funeral of the husband/father/grandfather. Present quickly turns to history as we learn how these women have come to their present condition of consistently disappointing each other in their attempts to show love to each other. The book is filled with insights about family dynamics and how difficult it can be for someone to be a mother, daughter, and independent person.The characters are interesting and the setting is fantastic. Readers have the opportunity to move into the elite circles of wealthy Nicaraguan families, presenting a view of this society that I have often been curious about. I had the pleasure of visiting Nicaragua last summer and the people completely stole my heart. I saw a completely different Nicaragua than the one portrayed in this book, again showing me the danger of a single story. At the same time, the challenges these women faced in understanding one another are common to most anyone and I think many readers will be enchanted by this story.And for my friends who love Nicaragua as much as I do, this is a highly recommended read."}, {"userName": "Meredith", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30978160-meredith", "userReview": "Eleni Gage\u2019s The Ladies of Managua is multigenerational novel that follows the lives of grandmother, Isabela; her daughter, Ninexin; and granddaughter, Maria.

Maria has secrets and troubles of her own in the form of a reluctant-to-commit older boyfriend, who is so absorbed in his burgeoning career as an artist that he is barely aware of Maria\u2019s existence. In fact, invisibility seems to have been Maria\u2019s fate for much of her life \u2013 her mother was too busy fighting and then rebuilding the country to have any time for her and her father died when she was a baby, gunned down in somewhat suspicious circumstances that are never explained to Maria. The infant Maria was raised by her doting grandmother, Isabella, who nurses secrets of her own. When Maria tried to ask questions about her father, all she is given is the rather enigmatic reply \u201cRevolutionaries make bad husbands.\u201dThis very well crafted novel has three narrators, the three ladies of the title, Maria, Ninexin and Isabella and the story moves between the three voices and time scales seemingly effortlessly, unfolding in a leisurely manner through these three different viewpoints. The first half of the book is taken up with each woman\u2019s private thoughts: Maria\u2019s anxiety about her relationship and resentment of her mother; Ninexin\u2019s guilt at her abandonment of her daughter; and Isabella\u2019s obsession over a long-ago love affair. The novel really leaps to life, however, when the secrets begin to be revealed, which coincides with the arrival of Maria\u2019s boyfriend, Allen, who has come hot foot in pursuit of her. Over the rest of the book, Maria gets some answers to her questions, particularly the one about revolutionaries making bad husbands.It requires real skill on the part of a writer to create such different voices for each of the three characters, but surely the most beguiling has got to be Isabella as she takes us back to her girlhood in 1950\u2019s New Orleans. Gage tells us in her acknowledgements that the character is based on her husband\u2019s grandmother and it\u2019s easy to believe. There is real truth in this character and in her story. Isabella is fascinating and infuriating in equal measure, but you never tire of hearing her talk, particularly when she is addressing and putting in his place the rather hapless Allen.I loved this book, loved the glimpse into such different and differing lives, but what is perhaps best of all about it is the view it gives you of the landscape and the history of Nicaragua, both past and present. Nicaragua, I am told, is one of the really up-and-coming travel destinations and, reading this novel, it isn\u2019t hard to see why."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9420458-jennifer", "userReview": "Secrets. Love. Loss. Passion. This richly-drawn novel weaves the life stories of three generations Nicaraguan women -- Isabella, a grandmother mourning the loss of her husband; her daughter Ninexin, the revolutionary turned stoic government official; and her grand-daughter Maria, an artist living in New York City trying to navigate her own complicated life. Each chapter is told in the first person from an alternating point of view, unfolding the story of the complex family dynamics between these three women. (Note: I found this alternating first person a bit confusing at first and it took me awhile to figure out who was who. I finally stopped at Chapter 3, and wrote out everyone's name, multiple nicknames and relationship to each other. Once I'd done this reading the story became much easier.)Overall the characters were well developed, especially Isabella and Maria. I found it harder to relate to Ninexin as she seemed stilted and some of her behaviors incongruent. While all the men in the book take supporting roles, they present an interesting character study as they are vastly different from each other.If you enjoy a good family drama, you will like this book and won't be disappointed. Note to Boston-area friends, author Eleni Gage will have a book reading/signing for \"The Ladies of Managua\" at 7 p.m. at Brookline Booksmith, 279 Harvard St. in Brookline. on Thursday, May 7.Thank you to NetGally and St. Martin's Press for an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Lynne Spreen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3448260-lynne-spreen", "userReview": "Wow. I can't believe how much work this author did to bring us this story. The Ladies of Managua is written in three voices, three generations of women - grandmother, mother, and daughter - all who are trying to find their way in the present, all weighted down by the past. But what a past! The central figure for me is Ninexin, the middle-generation woman (named after an Aztec warrior) who was a guerrilla fighter in the Sandinista army of Nicaragua. Now she's a powerful governmental figure, but also she's just a mother whose relationship with her daughter is possibly damaged beyond repair. This is because, during the war, Ninexin leaves her daughter to be raised by the grandmother. All three must figure out who they are now, who they are in relation to each other, and where love fits in relation to their hard-won sense of self.But beyond this, which I've described badly and made to sound pedestrian, are the settings. From author Gage, who as she said in the afterword married not just a man but his family and his country, we learn about the history and customs of Nicaragua. This by itself was almost worth the read, but also entrancing was the depiction of the life of a privileged young woman (the grandmother) who, in 1951, attends a Catholic girls' school in New Orleans. The descriptions are so rich, I'm amazed at the tenacity and imagination of the author.The only negative about the story was that the introspection of each of the three characters, the internal monologues, went on too long. In my opinion, the book could have been slightly shorter and the pace enhanced in this way. However, it's such an enveloping read, one immerses oneself in it and enjoys the experience, regardless. Having read it on Kindle, I may buy it in paperback just for the pleasure of having it to read at my leisure for years to come."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2688545-andrew", "userReview": "Nicaragua is such a colorful place. The bright tropics, beaches, jungles mix with the First Lady's penchant for bright pastels on public signage and billboards. The people and history are vibrant too, fraught with resilience, repression, revolution, and war. Those layers of culture, geography, and history can overwhelm the senses at times, and it can be difficult to step back and appreciate each in turn, to find common patterns or narratives without reducionism.The cover of this novel aptly symbolizes this sentiment, and (more importantly) Eleni Gage's writing beautifully conveys this reality in modern Nicaragua. Using creative narration, excellent pacing, and a genuine respect for the country's complexity, the author successfully weaves together a story that is both personal and national. This is not intended to be historical fiction nor does it cover a long dramatic arc of action; rather, the power of this book is in showing how the dramatic arch of history reverberates in personal lives in unexpected ways.Read more at http://znovels.blogspot.com/2016/08/t..."}, {"userName": "Shana", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/298930-shana", "userReview": "I won this in a Goodreads giveaway. Thanks, Goodreads! The Ladies of Managua tells the life stories of Isabela, Ninexin and Mariana: grandmother, daughter and granddaughter through flashbacks and storytelling, all in the few days around Isabela's husband's death. Mariana was basically raised by Isabela because Ninexin was working in the revolution in Nicaragua. Thus, Mariana and Isabela are much closer that Ninexin and Marian, or Ninexin and Isabela, for that matter. Each woman has more backstory than she shares with the others. It is these secrets that cause problems and resentments. Through the stress of these few short days and a few external triggers, the women finally start telling their stories. The backstories were what made the book engaging. The secrets and the inability to open up and be close, as they all desired, was frustrating to read, but not unrealistic. I was especially captivated by Isabela's story and how it resolved.

Isabel, the grandmother is looking back on her own girlhood and early life as well as mourning the very recent death of her husband. The daughter of Isabel, Ninexin, is also reflecting back on her own life as a young mother and wife, as well as her role as a Sandanista during Nicaragua's revolution. And Ninexin's daughter, Maria is absorbed in her anger over her mother's frequent absences from her childhood, while also trying to think through her confusion about the relationship she left behind in New York, with her artist boyfriend.

Written by an American magazine editor whose husband has family roots in Nicaragua, the story references many of the cities and hotels that I know, and the heroine takes a trip to the exotic Solentiname Islands in Lake Nicaragua, a place I have always wanted to visit.  The story itself is simple -- a young Nicaraguan woman living in NY gets pg by her older lover and travels to Nicaragua, where we learn resonating stories about her mom and grandma and their lovers.

Main issue is that the words & tone don't shift from character to character.

It's also boring/confusing to keep track of 3 different narrators who seem to think the same.

There was just something about this book\u2019s synopsis that piqued my interest; I think that it was the setting in Nicaragua. I don\u2019t know much about the culture of any of the countries south of us and I\u2019m always looking to be educated a bit when I read a book. This one was very enjoyable \u2013 I read it on my flights from Missoula to Nashville and it made the time pass very quickly. Even when my butt was flying out of the seat due to turbulence.It is the story (stories?) of three women in one family \u2013 grandmother, daughter and granddaughter and it\u2019s told in alternating voices. The grandmother, Isabela cared for her granddaughter, Maria in Miami after fleeing Nicaragua during the revolution. Maria\u2019s mother, Ninexin was a revolutionary who lost her husband when Maria was only 4 months old. They tell their tales in alternating chapters and while there is not much change in writing style between the three you can get a definite sense of their personalities from how they present their aspect of the ongoing story.Of the three women I have to admit that it was Isabela I liked the most. Maria did not resonate with me at all. I seem to read a fair number of books with characters like her; wishy-washy, unsure of her life\u2019s path, unsure of what to do about the man in her life. A still trying to figure it all out at 33 kind of girl. (Her boyfriend was a bit of a tough character for me as well.) I just don\u2019t understand these characters but they must be popular if I keep running into them. It\u2019s probably because I am not old enough to be a grandmother (did I just type that?!) and of a completely different generation than these kids today.Despite not being able to relate to Maria her third of the book was integral to the tale and I did enjoy the book. It held a couple of good surprises that were revealed as the book reached its conclusion. The descriptions of the cities and towns in Nicaragua were very well written and I did enjoy learning a little bit about the culture of the country and its history."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1619431-stephanie", "userReview": "The Ladies of Managua took me forever to get into \u2013 in fact, I still haven\u2019t really gotten into the book. And now I have officially given up. It took me more than 3 days to read about 150 pages which for me is a feat in that of itself because I can usually finish a few hundred pages in 1-2 days and the fact that I couldn\u2019t for this book spoke volumes to me.I really wanted to get into this book especially because St. Martin\u2019s so kindly sent over a copy to me but honestly, I just couldn't. The synopsis sounded promising \u2013 telling the story of 3 generations of women of the same family who had come together to mourn for a loved one and then were faced to deal with their differences and misunderstandings over the years. Unfortunately, for me, it fell flat.For this review, I won\u2019t delve too much into the characters since I only read about 150 or so pages so I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing a lot of valuable input/information on the characters so I will mostly discuss about the writing style and whatnot. To put it straightforward: I did not like the writing style. I didn\u2019t mind the three different POVs going on but it was incredibly confusing especially within each person\u2019s POV. There were many times when, for example, Isabela (the grandmother) discussed what was going on in the present and then randomly flashing back to, I don\u2019t know how many years ago. Plus, there were so many people\u2019s name especially the past boyfriends/husbands from all three females that I got so confused. I was always trying to flip back and remind myself who everyone was. To be perfectly honest, it made everything super choppy and didn\u2019t flow as smoothly as it should have.Overall, the book isn\u2019t for me but it seems that from all of the positive Goodreads reviews and feedback that this book was pretty great for a lot of people.

I would have enjoyed more depth and reading about the Mother who was with a young child and involved in the revolution. However, all three of these women participated in their own \"revolution\". We did have a very good discussion at book club about the book which was not precipitated by the discussion questions I brought to the meeting. The format of the book was similar to some I've read, and I rather like. Shorter chapters, told by the different women. The first sentence of each chapter was the same sentence, just spoken by a different woman. Some of my fellow book club members do not like the formatting of the different speakers narrating, and it was perhaps made more difficult given the names used.

Complex characters, beautiful imagery, fascinating storyline moving in time and place from Managua, New Orleans, Miami and beyond. Truly a tale of the complex relationships among strong women in a complex family. I thought the author in particularly absolutely nailed the relationship between Mariana and her mother Ninexin, with breathtaking power and raw emotion. Amazing to see, as I've never read a novel that so expertly examined the complexity of a mother-daughter relationship in a situation such as this - successful mother whose passion and career separated her from her daughter for much of her daughter's childhood - successful daughter who both admires and resents her mother while adoring the grandparents who raised her. I learned a tremendous amount about life in Nicaragua but truly the characters and family dynamics stole the show for me. Highly recommend. 4 stars only because at times the story moves a little slowly and I thought could have used more plot in certain areas."}], "description": "When Maria Vazquez returns to Nicaragua for her beloved grandfather's funeral, she brings with her a mysterious package from her grandmother's past\u2014and a secret of her own. And she also carries the burden of her tense relationship with her mother Ninexin, once a storied revolutionary, now a tireless government employee. Between Maria and Ninexin lies a chasm created by the death of Maria\u2019s father, who was killed during the revolution when Maria was an infant, leaving her to be raised by her grandmother Isabela as Ninexin worked to build the new Nicaragua. As Ninexin tries to reach her daughter, and Maria wrestles with her expectations for her romance with an older man, Isabela, the mourning widow, is lost in memories of attending boarding school in 1950\u2019s New Orleans, where she loved and lost almost sixty years ago. When the three women come together to bid farewell to the man who anchored their family, they are forced to confront their complicated, passionate relationships with each other and with their country\u2014and to reveal the secrets that each of them have worked to conceal. Lushly evocative of Nicaragua, its tumultuous history, and vibrant present, The Ladies of Managua brings you into the lives of three strong and magnetic women, as they uncover the ramifications of the choices they made in their pasts and begin to understand the ways in which love can shape their futures.", "title": "The Ladies of Managua", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23014693-the-ladies-of-managua", "average": 3.63, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1428638820l/23014693.jpg", "reviews": 58, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/131245.Eleni_N_Gage", "name": "Eleni N.
