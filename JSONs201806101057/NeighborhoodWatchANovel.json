The premise of the book is that Betsy spends 12 years in prison for murdering her neighbor, Linda Sue, apparently while sleep walking. Now, she is being relaeased b/c DNA evidence proves she did not commit the murder. Betsy goes back to the same suburban neighborhood and mves in with neighbrs, since she and Her husband divorced while she wa in prison, in an attempt to figure out what happened.As the story is getting set up and all the characters, especially all the neighborhood folks, it seems like an intriguing story. I get interested in figuring out this \"whodunit\". However, as the book goes along, the story gets weirdly convoluted, the characters get more bizarre and I'm feeling like I'm reading the script for a season's worth of Desperat House4wives. Reading this book confirmed my aversion to living in suburban housing developments. By the end of the book I was exhausted from all the twists & turns and strange characters that the ending seemed out of left field. If you liked the TV show Desperate Housewives, you might find this book right up your alley! I've read other Cammie McGovern books and really liked them; this one, not as well. I'll keep my eyes out for her next one and hope it's as good as Eye Contact."}, {"userName": "Paul Pessolano", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4877713-paul-pessolano", "userReview": "You wouldn't find too many novels classified as fiction/literature that will give you everything you would want in a true mystery. \"Neighberhood Watch\" does it.This is a very low key novel that is almost totally devoid of action, but provides an ending that few will be able to unravel.The story concerns four families living in an isolated cull de sac. Although the families interact with each other, all harbor secrets.Betsy Treading, town librarian, has spent the last twelve years in the Connecticut Correctional Institute for Women. She has been convicted for the murder of her neighbor, Linda Sue Murphy.Betsy wins her release when DNA testing shows she did not murder her neighbor. Betsy has nowhere to go and accepts her former neighbor's offer to live with them until she can get settled. She, obviously, finds it hard to move back into he old neighberhood, especially when her neighbors are still unsure of her innocence.Betsy starts her own investigation to find out who the real killer is, and starts to discover the dark and hidden lives of her neighbors. The more Betsy gets involved the more difficult it becomes to separated the different stories about what happened the night of the murder.\"Neighborhood Watch\" will give you plenty of possibilities and many characters to change your mind as to what happened that night, who is responsible, and just how it all came about.

Betsy Treading gets convicted of a murder she can't remember doing and spends 12 years in jail until DNA evidence proves her innocent. She should be happy to be out of the joint, but it seems life is more complicated that it once was, people have changed... she's changed, but one thing hasn't changed, she still wants to find the real murderer. As she looks into her past, she realizes things weren't always what she thought and people are hiding things from her. Will she ever find out what happened 12 years ago when her life was forever changed?This book was so entertaining. The first half focused on her time in prison, the friends she made, and the fact that even though she's glad to be out, she's really going to miss it because after she gets out of prison, that's when things start to get complicated. This book is an absolute page-turner with drama at every corner. Every time I thought I knew who the real murderer was, McGovern threw me for a loop and I was way off. You have yourself second-guessing everyone by the end and believe me when I say, you will never guess who the real killer is."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4209925-nancy", "userReview": "I couldn't finish this book. I really did try, and I *hate* giving up on a book, but this one I just couldn't stomach. It's about a woman named Betsy who is wrongfully convicted of killing her neighbor while she was sleepwalking, freed on a DNA exoneration, and then presumably must find the true killer. I'm sure this author is a capable and well established author, but I found so many errors in this book that I just couldn't suspend any fraction of disbelief. Firstly, the author would have us believe that there are no mirrors in prison, and therefore the main character hadn't seen a reflection of herself in the 12 years she was incarcerated. Then she wanted us to believe that her heroine asked her husband for a divorce so that she, the prisoner, could have \"a life.\" Save yourself the trouble of reading this book, and just read the last chapter, or find a spoiler elsewhere."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3534502-julie", "userReview": "When I first read the synopsis for this book, I was excited to read this story. Unfortunately, this book was a big disappointment to me. The main character, Betsy, just didn't seem believable to me. The author spent alot of time describing Betsy's thoughts and emotions, but she still seemed so plastic. I thought the supporting characters were more well written than the main character (who hasn't had a rude, controlling neighbor like Marianne?). Also, the plot line didn't flow well for me. The chapters alternated between present day and past scenes, but they weren't put together in a cohesive way.

A murder she confessed to, but immediately wanted to recant, and had no way to do it without jeopardizing her defense.Betsy has many problems, typical of most of us who have been socialized to behave within narrow bounds of acceptability. This is especially noticeable within the middle and upper-middle class, who often go into considerable debt to make it appear that they have arrived at, or ensconced in a certain level of achievement and acceptability. We are groomed by society as children to fall into certain behaviours, hold certain interests and attain a level of popularity and acceptance that will not disappoint our parents. Often we have family secrets that seem so shameful to us when we are young that we live in fear that they will be found out. This makes it extremely difficult to figure out who we truly are and what we are truly interested in and want to engage in and who we want to share our lives with as a balanced adult.Cammie McGovern has selected a perfect foil for the investigation of how we lie to others and our selves. She sets her characters down in a typical middle class suburb, with homes that are much the same, likely 2 models with four elevations, the biggest changes between them being reverse floor plans....and how neighbors try to be the very epitome of what each feels is the perfectly happy and normal couple with or without perfectly happy and normal children. Betsy gets exonerated and released from prison after serving 12 years and returns to her old neighborhood to try to figure out who the real killer is. She and her husband have been divorce and much has changed in the old neighborhood, and one of her old neighbors offers to let her stay at their home until she can get on her feet. Her ways of viewing life has changed over her years in prison and she sees her neighbors, friends and husband and the person she was 12 years earlier in a different light. This allows her to look back on that night when Linda Sue was murdered and figure out who was actually the real killer. Very insightful, and the perpetrator was the last person anyone would expect. Well crafted and very engaging."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2493071-linda", "userReview": "I had difficulty connecting with this book. I found that the story line kept skipping around and the characters did not feel developed. It didn\u2019t make sense that this ideal community could be so bizarre in the individual stories that were told. Linda Sue, the newest neighbor was an interesting character but there was not enough about her to make her such a pivotal person. The idea of Betsy confessing to a murder she did not commit was a possibility but it took a long time to find out why this happened. When she was released from prison and returns to the neighborhood, I found the living arrangements and interactions implausible. She was found innocent and then came back to live in the community with the neighbors did not seem realistic. The \u201dNeighborhood Watch\u201d group bringing in experts to help them work together on community safety issues is done in many communities but the idea of selling guns and locks etc felt a bit contrived.There were some interactions between the characters such as the flashback where the librarian (Betsy the main character) and Trisha, the young neighbor which rang true for me.As a child I used to ride my bike to the quiet and cool McKinley Library in Sacramento where I hung out and read. Now, as a librarian my interaction with the kids that come into our library and want to be read, be seen and heard and have a safe, cool and friendly place to enjoy the world of reading I am taken back to the wonderful feeling I had as a child.This novel may have been deeper that I experienced but for me and other may enjoy the lack of cohesiveness I experienced reading it.

But I told myself to hold off and not pass judgment so quickly...but as I finished the book last night I still thought it: THAT BITCH CRAY!!!!!!!So first of all, if I just got out of prison, I would at least gorge myself on food and coffee and all of the stuff I didn't get whilst locked up. Or at the very least, I would just lie in a comfortable bed and roll around. It seemed like Betsy just floated from prison to not-prison without having it register with her. Her reaction was just...odd. She acted like she had just been away for a few days and not locked up with violent crazy bitches for 12 years. I'm glad she had friends and helped out there, BUT IT'S STILL PRISON!Next, and oh boy Ima get slammed for this but here we go. There are hundreds of reasons why I don't want kids and why I am glad I have never wanted them: Betsy is about the number one reason. I truly do not understand how women let this ruin their lives. As I always say--never want something so much such that failure to get it will ruin you. (Should there be commas in there? I feel like there should be). To put your body through what she put it through, to stay married to a gay man (come on now, she didn't just figure this out!), to give up everything just so you can have a kid...I don't get it. Look. Life doesn't turn out the way you think it will. I thought I'd be 40 years old, living in Washington DC, have the president's ear, go to high class parties, be a wealthy attorney living in a sweet house with a sweet ride...and that didn't happen. It's okay that it didn't happen, but I can't let that ruin me. I'm sure folks will say that this is different than the \"urge\" to have kids which leads me to this...Is it an \"urge\" that is nature or nurture? I know we won't know because women < 1960 didn't really have a choice in whether or not to bear kids. I guess we'd have to ask infertile women from that era and ask how they reacted to not being able to have kids. If they didn't much care, I would argue that this \"biological clock\" need to have a kid hanging off your tit is nurtured in our society. My mom was fairly honest with me about how it was to have kids and so I never \"learned\" that I should want one. (She loved me but, to this day, doesn't care for kids in general). I felt like everything Betsy did was shaped by her inability to breed. And why didn't they even discuss adoption until the Trish thing? Are these people that selfish that they have to have their genes floating around? I don't get that...you want soooooooooooooo much to be a mom, right? Well shit girl. I want a sailboat and I don't give a crap if it's used (not that adopted kids are \"used\"; probably a bad example). I also didn't quite get why certain things were just sort of thrown into the novel as an afterthought--Geoffrey getting sued for plagirism? The whole cold fusion thing? Leo? And speaking of Geoffrey...was I the only one was wanted to beat his punk ass bitch ass? How could those stupid people be so...stupid? You could see this punk coming a mile away yet they all swooned and fell into it like lambs. The only part of the book that I can say I really enjoyed was the description of cold fusion and the story of Trish. While I don't find the cold fusion plot necessary, the author did a SUPER job of explaining it in a way that even I could understand. The *idea* of this book was cool but the execution was odd. Why were these people all so secretive? Is that what happens when you live in McMansions (which by her own admission, Betsy could not afford...so, how was she going to pay the house note when she popped out her five kids and quit her job?) in the 'burbs? The Linda Sue character was oddly written too...and then suddenly at the end we find out she had miscarriages and therefore maybe wasn't so bad? If nothing else, this book made me extremely happy that I never once had the biological (or learned) desire to have kids. The way Betsy lost herself in her pretend kids will stay with me for a long time."}, {"userName": "Sonia", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3414021-sonia", "userReview": "Sapevo che aprendo questo libro avrei avuto tra le mani un thriller, genere che negli ultimi mesi mi sta appassionando sempre pi\u00f9. Pertanto ero sicura che vi avrei trovato gli elementi tipici di questo genere narrativo: tensione portata a livelli altissimi, scene adrenaliniche, momenti di forte paura (...paura per la lettrice fifona che \u00e8 in me e che a stento regge la lettura di determinate situazioni!). Se pensate anche voi di accostarvi al romanzo della McGovern con la stessa mia convinzione, dimenticatevene. Non ci troverete nulla di tutto ci\u00f2, eppure il romanzo sar\u00e0 comunque all'altezza del suo genere. L'autrice infatti ha saputo creare una storia in cui il mistero che si viene a creare \u00e8 cos\u00ec immerso nella quotidianit\u00e0 che, per scovare la verit\u00e0, tutto ci\u00f2 di cui si ha bisogno \u00e8 un buon intuito: bisogna essere in grado di riconoscere le menzogne e gli inganni dietro le belle parole, le false apparenze, dietro tutta quella perfezione di facciata che si presenta a Juniper Lane.Leggendo quelle pagine sembra quasi di trovarsi nella ben pi\u00f9 famosa Wisteria Lane, dove si svolge la serie tv statunitense Desperate Housewives. Hanno in comune i segreti che ogni persona nasconde e il tentativo di apparire un buon vicino per poter carpire i segreti dell'altro. Hanno in comune gli appostamenti dietro le tende per spiare ci\u00f2 che gli altri stanno facendo e sperare di scoprire tutto ci\u00f2 che non \u00e8 mai stato detto. Hanno in comune un delitto misterioso. A Juniper Lane viene assassinata una nuova vicina di casa, l'unica che non vuole accattivarsi la simpatia degli altri, ma preferisce mostrarsi a tutti cos\u00ec com'\u00e8, senza peli sulla lingua. Eppure anche lei sembra nascondere mille segreti. La sua morte porta scompiglio nel vicinato, e verr\u00e0 arrestata una donna, una bibliotecaria, Betsy Treading, che pare l'abbia uccisa durante i suoi episodi di sonnambulismo. Betsy dovr\u00e0 scontare anni e anni di carcere prima di essere rilasciata per un errore giudiziario. Il ritorno di Betsy a Juniper Lane non sar\u00e0 motivo di particolare tensione, perch\u00e9 ormai tutti coloro che vivevano in quel posto hanno preferito andarsene piuttosto che star l\u00ec e ricordare il terribile omicidio. Eppure i pregiudizi sono ancora nell'aria e toccher\u00e0 a Betsy cercare di capire ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 successo tanti anni prima. Chi e perch\u00e9 uccise Linda. La sua ricerca la porter\u00e0 a scoprire, uno dopo l'altro, i segreti di una buona parte die suoi vicini, segreti pericolosi anche se non legati direttamente alla morte della donna. Solo quando arriver\u00e0 alla sconvolgente verit\u00e0, capir\u00e0 di averlo sempre saputo, di essere sempre stata parte di quel gioco. Solo grazie a quella verit\u00e0 pu\u00f2 ora andare avanti e rifarsi una vita. Il romanzo \u00e8 ben scritto, soprattutto ben organizzato. La McGovern ci ha fornito tantissimi dettagli per darci la possibilit\u00e0 di scoprire chi potesse aver ucciso la donna, e io da parte mia sono riuscita a scoprirlo molto tempo prima di Betsy. Non perch\u00e9 la trama sia debole e prevedibile, ma perch\u00e9 riordinando i tasselli si comincia a entrare nella mente dell'autrice e a ricostruire i fatti. Un buon esercizio logico, una lettura che sottolinea il potere delle bugie, delle apparenze e la loro influenza sul mondo esterno, un romanzo che fa tremare di fronte alle mille possiblit\u00e0 di errori giudiziari....Decisamente da leggere.qui:http://cuoredinchiostro.blogspot.com/..."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/929158-michelle", "userReview": "Here is my review for The Associated Press:\u00b6 \"Neighborhood Watch\" (Viking, 288 pages, $25.95), by Cammie McGovern: When sleepwalker Betsy Treading found a blood stain on her nightgown days after her neighbor was murdered, she assumed her nighttime stroll had turned deadly. But after more than a decade in prison, Betsy begins to question what happened that night.\u00b6 An aggressive appeals attorney is able to use new DNA tests to raise doubt about whether she was even in her neighbor's house when the woman was bludgeoned, and Betsy is freed. But that's where the mystery begins. If Betsy isn't guilty, who is?\u00b6 Cammie McGovern borrows elements from some of today's top news stories for her third novel, \"Neighborhood Watch.\" Like real-life prisoners freed by the work of Innocence Projects in a number of states, Betsy has her conviction overturned only after DNA tests become available and cast doubt on earlier evidence. And several real-life defendants have unsuccessfully tried sleepwalking defenses like Betsy's.\u00b6 The new element McGovern offers readers with her fictional account is access to Betsy's thought process. McGovern explores why someone would confess to a crime he or she didn't commit, and the author looks at how they could, over time, come to believe their own guilt.\u00b6 She also delves into how childhood traumas can result in suppressed memories that emerge in easily misunderstood bits and pieces.\u00b6 Set in an upscale Connecticut town, \"Neighborhood Watch\" also captures the sense of suburban isolation that is often married with awareness of being carefully watched by one's neighbors. Like everyone on Juniper Lane, Betsy and her husband conform in an effort to fit in. Almost as upsetting as her wrongful conviction is Betsy's realization that she hadn't kept her sleepwalking and grief over multiple miscarriages hidden from her neighbors as she once believed. McGovern creates a sense that a murder conviction is, in some ways, less shameful among Betsy's set than the gossip generated by depression, marital problems or other failures to achieve the community standard of normalcy.\u00b6 The novel's main shortcoming is the unveiling of the true killer, whose identity is predictable. The supporting characters also feel somewhat flat compared with Betsy, as if McGovern was so focused on developing her identity and thought process that she skimmed by the others.\u00b6 Still, \"Neighborhood Watch\" is worth reading by anyone who has wondered why innocent people confess and how investigators fail to realize their mistakes. In one of McGovern's most acute observations, Betsy reflects she might have been less likely to accept her own guilt if she hadn't been hungry. She wanted to do what was right, but she also hoped a signed confession would get her a sandwich."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4427991-mary", "userReview": "\"Librarian Found Innocent of Crime After Twelve Years in Prison,\" the newspaper headlines read.

Back in her old neighborhood without a job, a car, a place to live, or her husband, Betsy is determined to clear her name and find Linda Sue's murderer at all costs. So, she sets out to unravel the complex web of denial, delusion, and secrets that have seemingly paralyzed the community. But the ultimate question is: will this former librarian be successful in shattering the perfect facade that protects such an idyllic world and has apparently ensnared her community?Neighborhood Watch: A Novel by Cammie McGovern is an intricately woven, psychologically astute tale that will keep readers guessing until the very last page. This is a riveting and frightening story of false accusations, and of the lengths to which some people will go to to keep their 'white-picket-fence' facade in place. It is also the story of a woman coming into her own, finding her strength, and taking control of her life. It asks readers, what sort of price would you pay for the sake of your reputation?In my opinion, this was an amazing book. I was immediately sucked into the story; it was an engrossing, nail-biting psychological tour-de-force - filled with all the secrets, lies, and deceptions of life in small-town suburbia. I appreciated that this story was so well-paced; I found it not necessarily over-dramatic, but always flowing and moving.In my opinion, the plot never became boring or stilted; what drama there was, never slowed or stalled the story. I found this story thoroughly intriguing and I wanted to know what happened next. I would give Neighborhood Watch: A Novel by Cammie McGovern a definite A+! This is the first book that I've read by this author, but it most certainly will not be my last."}, {"userName": "Bert Edens", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3381014-bert-edens", "userReview": "(The first part of this review is actually safe... I note below where the Spoilers start)Won this in a First Reads giveaway. And the more I read it, the more I kept reading it because I felt obligated. First, the story just plods along. It flips back and forth between current and past events too much, sometimes making it difficult to follow what's happening and when. I really never felt like I just HAD to keep reading another 15 minutes, so so I can see what happens. Part of the issue with the plodding is there really never was the tension you would have liked to have seen. There were many dramatic revelations without the dramatic build-up. So when they happened, they seemed really out of place and forced.Second, the characters just weren't that strong, especially, and unfortunately, the protagonist. I saw a review stating the supporting characters were a lot stronger than the primary character, and I agree completely. While we learn a lot about Betsy Treading in the story, I never got to the point where I really cared what happens to her. Everything just seemed to be forced together, like a toddler with a jigsaw puzzle. Finally, and I know this has less to do with the author than it does with the editor, there was a LOT wrong with spelling, word spacing, indentation, punctuation, etc. That made it hard to get into the flow when you had to regularly re-read sentences. ***** SPOILER ALERT *****And it didn't surprise me \"Whodunnit\", either. It was like the author was methodically eliminating one person at a time, again without the build-up and drama, so that by the time it got to the end, you had a pretty good idea who was the murderer. And it just made sense it was the one main character from her past who was absent during the present. It was almost too convenient."}, {"userName": "Dolly", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly", "userReview": "I keep meaning to attend a book club meeting at my local library. The first step was knowing it existed and noting the book selections. The next step was borrowing the book and reading it. Now the only real step that remains for me is to actually attend the meeting. One of these days I'll do it. I swear. This month, Neighborhood Watch was the book selection. I borrowed the book in time to read it before the meeting, but I forgot and read other books instead. When I realized what I had done, I didn't have enough time to read the book before the meeting. But I still finished the story and it was a thought-provoking read indeed. I think I would have enjoyed the discussion. Perhaps next month. This was a twisted tale. The movement of the story from past to present was often sudden and somewhat confusing. Questions ran rampant through my brain as the story progressed, although I was pleased that most, if not all, were answered by the time the story ended. I liked the way that the author depicted her characters as flawed and often a bit disfunctional, but sometimes I felt like the story was a bit muddled. Overall it was a good mystery and I never guessed \"whodunit.\" I thought the ending was a bit abrupt, but the story felt like it was at a stopping point, if not a true ending. The characters didn't ride off into the sunset or live \"happily ever after,\" and that is okay."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1390765-diane", "userReview": "Betsy Treading, a librarian from a small town in Connecticut is convicted of murdering her neighbor --loner, and somewhat eccentric Linda Sue Murphy. The quiet librarian suffered from panic disorders, and was known to sleepwalk, and she was unable to recall earlier events that may have occurred during those times. After spending twelve years in prison, losing her job, her home, and her husband, she is released from prison when DNA evidence proves she was not the killer.Upon her release, Betsy returns to live in the same neighborhood, at the home of a loyal friend and her husband. Although some of the people have moved, Betsy is obsessed with finding out who really killed Linda Sue, hoping to clear her name once and for all. As she begins a slow and steady process of questioning people and events, Betsy seems to recall some important bits of information about the night in question. In the process she must also deal with some painful secrets of her past.MY THOUGHTS - This was a good psychological mystery. I liked the fact that the characters were every day people, who could be most anyone's neighbor. The novel was fewer than 300 pages, and was good, but it lacked that nail biting effect. The ending was a total surprise. I love when an author leaves me stumped. Overall a decent read. I also enjoyed this author's earlier books: Eye Contact and The Art of Seeing.RECOMMENDED - 4/5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Mary MacKintosh", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/710710-mary-mackintosh", "userReview": "When Neighborhood Watch begins its main character is in prison for a murder that she thinks maybe that she did not commit, although she confessed to it. It turns out she is correct; she is not the killer, and she is released, to return to the neighborhood where it all began. At one point in the early chapters she states that she is where she should be (incarcerated)\u2014because she has found friendship, community, and purpose in the women's prison. Because of that statement I fully expected her to return to prison, to a life that had meaning. The novel progresses by jumping backwards and forwards in her story, until the resolution.I confess I know the name of the murder victim (Linda Sue) but I cannot recall the main character's name. She seems particularly bloodless; no passions, no strong interests, nothing that brings any dimension to her. I found her prison love interest likely, given her circumstance, but not something that would have survived her release. The novel sort of indicates that it is flawed, but leaves that situation unresolved. Her return to the neighborhood makes some sense; she is trying to understand what really happened 12 years before, but only one couple from that time is still living on Juniper Lane.The book held my interest. It was well written, but I feel no satisfaction in its completion"}, {"userName": "Kathleen Hagen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1291703-kathleen-hagen", "userReview": "Neighborhood Watch, by Cammie McGovern, Borrowed from National Library for the Blind, available also from audible.com, produced by Tantor Media.12 years ago, librarian Betsy Treading was convicted of murdering her neighbor, the bohemian loner Linda Sue.
