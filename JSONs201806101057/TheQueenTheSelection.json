But as far as being fiesty (or at the very least...interesting)? Nope. Nada. Zilch.When we read her own story, every bit of magic and love fizzled out - like a firework on the fifth of July. Nothing special, nothing wondrous and ultimately, a bit sad. \nFor as harsh as his words were, his voice seemed to caress my name.\nIt was depressing to watch this young girl so easily fall prey to the manipulative, cruel prince. When he finds out that Amberly was poisoned in her home country (air quality, etc) - he recoils in horror  at her infertility and her diseased body. And yet, as much of a victim Amberly is...I still couldn't stand her.  She chose her life. She lets Clarkson be her everything right away - no independent thinking, no attempt to assert herself. \n\u201cHis world looked like a storm. I was going to be its center.\u201d\nShe's chosen not for her love, or for her looks...merely because she's willing to obey Prince Clarkson's every whim. He swears her to secrecy? She doesn't tell a soul. He tells her to cut her hair? She lobs off nearly a foot. He says to jump, and she's already jumping. \nBecause if it was a choice between him or me, I didn't think I'd be able not to put him first. He was the prince, and his life was invaluable to the country. But more than that, it was invaluable to me.\nThank goodness this one was short - I don't think I could've handled much more of it.Audiobook CommentsOkay, in Book 1 - Queen Amberly didn't have an accent but her sister had a strong southern twang (since they were Fours from the south). In this one, Amberly is said to be from Honduragua and has a fittingly strong native accent from that area. So, how did Amberly have a native Honduraguan accent while her sister is a southern belle? Somebody didn't plan out the audiobook too wellllllll....."}, {"userName": "Bookaholic (reads every mortal thing)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25058068-bookaholic-reads-every-mortal-thing", "userReview": "What the shit is this?This was supposed to be a heartfelt tale of how Maxon's mom, Amberly, went on to win the Selection and become Queen.

Maxon's dad (he shall hereby be referred to as M'sD as I didnt bother to remember his name and I don't care enough to check) is one of the most assholic son of a bitches I have ever read about and Amberly is not only a human doormat, but also the most na\u00efve idiot I have ever come across-\n\"From now on your only job is to show up, be a lady, sit there, and smile.\"[M'sD's mom] eyes met with mine as she ended her speech, and, stupidly, I thought that was a command.

M'sD shrivels up his face in disgust when he hears about the deformities people get in Amberly's hometown, and makes Amberly's feel extremely shitty when she finds out that she is infertile.

Or maybe she didn't deserve so much after all and everything was in our heads? See? That's not right, so the book didn't do it for me. I wanted to know more about her.But can we talk about how Amberly was so like America? I mean, that makes it all worse because America was literally the little girl she could never have. Man, that was pretty hard.And if we're going to talk about freaking sad moments in this novella: \u201cI respect him,\u201d I defended. \u201cHe\u2019s the prince.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more than that. You\u2019d take a bullet for him if you had to.\u201dI didn\u2019t answer.Bad Kiera, bad.I still don't know what to make out of Clarkson, really. I mean, in this story he didn't seem to be that bad at all and yeah, I could see where he was coming from but still. He was way too much of an asshole to me to just forgive him like that.Anyhow, Amberly, you deserved so much more, darling. A lot more."}, {"userName": "Carol [Goodreads Addict]", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10717098-carol-goodreads-addict", "userReview": "The Queen is #0.4 in The Selection series by Kiera Cass. It\u2019s no secret how much I am in love with this series. I have been from the start. This little novella explains so much as to what made King Clarkson the man we know him as. It is the story of the previous Selection, when Queen Amberly met Clarkson while he was a Prince choosing his own future bride.\n Even though we get a good look at Clarkson\u2019s own parents, the current King and Queen and their very dysfunctional relationship, I still have a little trouble putting that Clarkson together with the one that so brutally beat Maxon. \n\u201cThis was joy. This was love. So many words you hear about or read about, and now\u2026now I knew them.\u201d\nAmberly was clearly smittened with Clarkson before she even met him. But were the reasons Clarkson chose her for love, or just because she was submissive to him? \n\u201cYou\u2019re soothing. I\u2019m desperate for peace. I think you might be the only chance I have at that.\u201d,/i>\n The Amberly we meet, though, is every bit the poised woman and future Queen we know her as. \n\u201cYou will be the only thing in this world that is truly mine. And I will put you on a pedestal so high, it will be impossible for anyone not to adore you.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Veronika", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13801365-veronika", "userReview": "UPDATE: Well, I kept putting this aside because I was afraid of it, as I mentioned. I mean Clarkson is a terrible person and how could I like someone who I know will hurt his son in the future? Here's the answer: I couldn't. And Queen Amberly creeped me out a bit too. I mean with America and Maxon the whole Selection didn't feel this... gross. Queen Amberly seemed like such a lady in The Selection but now I can't help seeing her like a submissive little girl. I have no idea why anyone would find a control freak crush worthy... no, just no. Oh my god we could see how Queen Amberly was before she became the Queen of Ill\u00e9a she was so amazing in the books and I can't let go of this series just yet. But... what if the king wasn't an ass back then what if I actually start to like him? (sigh) No matter what I'm still going to read it, I can't let go of this series just yet...

I just can't."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51318038-maggie", "userReview": "\u201cYou\u2019ve kept my secrets, and I assure you, if you marry me, there will be scores more to keep. You don\u2019t judge me, or seem startled by much. You\u2019re soothing.\u201d His gaze traveled up to my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m desperate for peace. I think you might be the only chance I have at that.\u201d\nI mean, I can see why King Clarkson was an actual jerk face in The Selection. He didn't like America, and he didn't like some of the girls. I'm pretty sure he got that from his mother, but pretty sure his attitude comes from his father. Even though the King and Queen before Clarkson and Amberly were mentioned like once (I think) in The Selection, there wasn't much said and nothing was needed. When Clarkson was a prince, he actually seemed nice and showed that he cared about the girls just like Maxon did! The difference is that Clarkson never smiled, never tried to laugh, and only smirked or showed half a grin once or twice. But suddenly Amberly is able to bring him peace and is able to do the things he's been waiting for: keep his secrets, bring him peace, and not act like a spoiled brat like the other selected girls.The Selection was not my favorite series. My favorite was definitely The One even though it had many flaws. I couldn't help but rate it a 5 just because it had more improvements and a lot of actual, shocking moments happened. I can see how The Selection came and was born from this, only being told from Queen Amberly's point of view. It's not like America where America doesn't want to enter the Selection and doesn't really care about marrying Prince Maxon, but Amberly has been in love with Clarkson since she was 7 and has wished to marry him, kiss him, have his arms wrapped around her, and yeah all that. Even though The Selection and The Prince are very different, Queen Amberly and America were different when they were selected, it makes sense as to why and how Kiera wrote the series. Queen Amberly has always been the loving and supporting Queen since introduced in the beginning. King Clarkson was known as someone who hardly smiles and pushes everything too hard, too much, and too far. Even though Amberly was the only one to lit his eyes and his world, I can see why he was an asshole. I never liked him, and never wished to try and like him. Luckily I didn't. But I understand why he acted the way he acted in the series and why. He had his reasons, mainly his parents to blame for since they were arguing and both were rude. Even though his mother was rude and would sometimes spoil herself and brag a little because she's Queen, Clarkson was easily able to catch her horrible personality and attitude. Nothing was really new, just made sense to the history of the beloved Amberly and Clarkson Schreave. It was interesting reading this and now I just want to know if Maxon really is Amberly's son. HA. HA. HA! Even though Amberly was told she may or may not be able to have children, there was still a possibility it was wrong. With that, I actually want to know how everything worked out and how Maxon was born. Not in the wrong way, I just want to know if Amberly took medication for this or if treatment was needed. If nothing was wrong, I want to know how it all worked out. Even though nothing was new and everything felt the same, there are still questions I have unanswered, but I guess it doesn't matter."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7591340-sarah", "userReview": "[ reading it knowing that Amberly and Clarkson are both now dead \u2639  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Julia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18979519-julia", "userReview": "Conclusion: King Clarkson has always been a huge asshole and Queen Amberly has always been a sweetheart."}, {"userName": "Thomas June", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20500289-thomas-june", "userReview": "KIERA CASS, ARE YOU SERIOUS!?I THOUGHT AFTER YOU'VE FINISHED THE ONE, THATS IT!!NO MORE, NO EXCESS!!BUT I CAN'T CONTAIN MY FEELS WHEN I SAW THIS, THIS EFFING GORGEOUS NOVELLA WITH AN AMAZING COVER.!!!!OHHHH KIERA, NOW WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!!

Sumisa, sosa y est\u00fapida; se enamor\u00f3 del pr\u00edncipe por la tele y est\u00e1 dispuesta a lamerle las medias con tal de que le sonr\u00eda \u00a1por favor!Amberly se la pasa llorando porque no puede tener un **** beb\u00e9, ech\u00e1ndose la culpa de todo. \u00bfQu\u00e9 acaso no se da cuenta de que ella no tiene la culpa de su decendencia? \u00bfQue en todo caso ser\u00eda culpa del estado, por hacerla beber la maldita agua contaminada? UfffffY encima est\u00e1 colada por el pr\u00edncipe Clarckson, que casualmente es id\u00e9ntico al pr\u00edncipe Maxon. Y no, no lo pude amar como a su hijo, porque sab\u00eda lo que har\u00eda despu\u00e9s con \u00e9l. \u00bfQu\u00e9 le estaba pasando por la cabeza a Kiera para pensar que podr\u00edamos amar al hijo de puta que castigaba a Maxon?\u00a1Sorpresa! Resulta que Clarkson tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 pasando por una situaci\u00f3n familiar horrible, con sus padre pele\u00e1ndose y su madre borracha, etc, etc, etc. TODO ES S\u00d3LO UNA COPIA DE LA HISTORIA ORIGINAL. Qu\u00e9 coincidencia que ambos pr\u00edncipes tengan la misma personalidad y los mismos problemas familiares \u00bfno?Y por si no pudiera odiar m\u00e1s a los personajes principales, resulta que los secundarios apenas tienen dos o tres l\u00edneas. No me s\u00e9 el nombre de ning\u00fan personaje adem\u00e1s de los principales porque no aparec\u00edan m\u00e1s que en un p\u00e1rrafo y porque me tra\u00edan sin cuidado. \u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00bfQU\u00c9 NO LO VEN?!!!!!! CLARCKSON ES MAXON Y AMBERLY ES AMERICA. (eso iba dirigido a las fans de este libro).Y Kiera Cass podr\u00eda haber aprovechado esta idiotez de libro poni\u00e9nole m\u00e1s historia de Ill\u00e9a. No s\u00e9. Podr\u00eda haber puesto que las cosas antes eran un tanto diferentes o lo que fuera, pero todo se mantuvo exactamente igual.\u00bfY saben qu\u00e9? \u00bfSaben la taradez que sucedi\u00f3 al final? Despu\u00e9s de estar juntos como por dos horas, Clarckson de repente elige a Amberly para casarse con ella. No le importa que sea una idiota, no le importa que no pueda tener beb\u00e9s, no le importa que apenas la conoce, simplemente le dice que la elije. \u00bfSaben por qu\u00e9 la eligi\u00f3? Por ser la m\u00e1s sumisa. Por ser la que le har\u00eda caso pasase lo que pasase (no me lo estoy inventando, son palabras textuales del libro). Y Amberly feliz a m\u00e1s no poder por ser as\u00ed de utilizada...Por lo que no es una historia de amor \u00a1\u00a1no!! Es una historia machista de obediencia y sumici\u00f3n.Encima de toda esa mierda, hay algo que no me cierra: \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 Clarkson elegir\u00eda a Amberly si no pueden tener herederos? Si no era por amor (como qued\u00f3 bien claro) el matrimonio fue por conveniencia. Y entiendo que Amberly sea la m\u00e1s obediente \u00bfpero no le preocup\u00f3 el hecho de no tener descendientes?. No es algo tan importante para una pareja normal, pero ser\u00eda lo m\u00e1s coherente que un futuro rey quisiera tener su reinado y el de su familia asegurado.\u00bfO s\u00f3lo quer\u00eda sexo salvaje sin cond\u00f3n?Sinceramente no lo s\u00e9. Y os juro que este libro me frustra mucho.Tiene buena pluma y se lee r\u00e1pido, esas son las \u00fanicas razones por las que no le pongo al libro una estrella.Con esta rese\u00f1a s\u00f3lo espero hacer entrar en raz\u00f3n a los que amaron este libro. S\u00e9 que cada uno tiene sus opiniones y todo ese rollo, pero, chicas, nos la pasamos luchando siglo tras siglo para los derechos de las mujeres, para la igualdad de g\u00e9nero, \u00bfy nos dejamos degradar por un libro as\u00ed?Porque b\u00e1sicamente Kiera Cass nos pone a las mujeres como una m\u00e1quina de hacer beb\u00e9s obediente que s\u00f3lo est\u00e1 para complacer a su marido. Y me niego a ser eso. Me niego a volver al siglo XVIII, me niego a que aunque sea en un libro de mierda volvamos a ser utilizadas as\u00ed.No es romance, no es acci\u00f3n, no es misterio, este libro no es nada. Ni siquiera se puede decir que es una distop\u00eda con todas las letras, ya que no se dice pr\u00e1cticamente nada acerca de Ill\u00e9a. A esto s\u00f3lo le falta el sexo y ya es Cincuenta Sombras de Grey (no lo digo de mala leche, es la verdad). UfffffffffffffffffEste libro la caga \u00bfentienden? la caga. La Selecci\u00f3n era una hermosa trilog\u00eda hasta que \u00a1BOOM! aparece The Queen y la caga.Estoy indignada.Y odio este libro."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer", "userReview": "The Queen is a prequel novella in Kiera Cass's young adult, dystopian series titled: The Selection Series. This short story features Maxon's father and mother, King Clarkson and Queen Amberly, and includes the story of how they met through their generation's selection process. I think most readers don't like King Clarkson in The Selection Series, so I was curious if he would be portrayed any differently during his younger years as prince. The answer is...I have to admit though, Ms. Cass was much more subtle in her character development of Clarkson, but his need to control and his hard-handed threats are still shown through his interactions with others in this prequel. The cycle of violence rings loud and clear within the portrait of this royal family, but any suggestion that Clarkson is a victim rang on deaf ears with me. Amberly is the perfect little submissive, which is something I didn't really view her as in the series, but maybe I just forgot. Through Amberly's point of view, the two of them have a very promising future together, and they may very well be just what each other needs. The Queen gives quite a bit of insight into these two characters, and when compared to the series, does a great job of reinforcing the fairytale aspect of Maxon and America's love story. This novella is a wonderful addition to the series and I would recommend it to fans.My favorite quote:\u201cBut shouldn't there be a least?

It`s only 72 pages long and almost each one of them made me scream internally. We get a glimpse of the life of Maxon`s parents: Queen Amberly and King Clarkson. Only she`s not a Queen yet and he`s just a Prince, looking for a wife. Amberly is a part of the Selection. She barely knows Clarkson (only thanks to TV) but he was the love of her life since before she could walk. Every night she prayed on his photo and picked names for their future babies. The story starts some time after she started to live in a palace as a Selected. Their first interaction with the Prince went somewhat like that:-\tCut your hair.-\tYou don`t like it?-\tMeh, I think you`ll look better with a short hair.-\tWell, even though I like my long hair, I would go bald if you asked to. So, my first expression was that Amberly is a na\u00efve, boneless fool and Clarkson is a son of a bitch (which turned out to be true, but I won`t even start with his mother, this is a complete shit). My expression only grows stronger after he starts to treat her like trash because of her caste, and she continues to see him as God.\n\u00abYou are never to tell anyone what you do. If anyone asks, your family owns a coffee plantation, and you help run it. Be vague and never, ever let on that you do manual labor. Are we clear?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dHe eyed me a moment longer, as if to reinforce the point. But his command was all I needed. I\u2019d never not do anything he asked me to.\u00bb\nHe`s a controlling jerk who can compete with Mr. Gray with his 50 shades, only without BDSM factor. His parents are constantly fighting and, because he doesn`t want to be like them, he`s looking for a wife that won`t ever say \u201cno\u201d to him. Yay, problem solved, no fighting! A husband everyone`s been dreaming for! His character can be described by one quote:\n\u00abI\u2019m the prince, and one day I will be king. My word is law.\u00bb\nMoreover, Amberly turned out to be infertile. How do you think he should`ve reacted? Obviously not by ignoring her while she felt depressed and needed his help. But everything ends fine \u2013 Clarkson doesn`t like kids anyway. If you thought The Selection was awful \u2013 try this one. Just for fun. Okay, seriously, don`t read it. I was pleased by the first book, but this novel only spoiled everything, especially my opinion about Maxon`s parents.

Vamos, todos los que hemos le\u00eddo The Selection sabemos qu\u00e9 clase de persona y de rey es Clarkson. Y much\u00edsimas veces nos preguntamos c\u00f3mo alguien tan dulce como Amberly lleg\u00f3 a ganar la Selecci\u00f3n y destinar el resto de su vida a ser la esposa de un hombre como Clarkson.The Queen nos muestra todo eso. Conocemos el origen humilde de Amberly, su profundo enamoramiento en el pr\u00edncipe desde que ten\u00eda siete a\u00f1os, su personalidad calmada, sus problemas de salud, su temple. Adem\u00e1s, tambi\u00e9n conocemos a un Clarkson joven, lleno de ideas y de energ\u00eda para dirigir a un pa\u00eds; pero tambi\u00e9n conocemos a un Clarkson perturbado por la horrorosa relaci\u00f3n de sus padres, obligado a ser fuerte, mentir y tener todos sus movimientos absolutamente calculados. Es extra\u00f1\u00edsimo leer este relato y ver que Amberly, a\u00fan entendiendo y siendo part\u00edcipe de las explosiones en el car\u00e1cter de Clarkson, haya querido ser su princesa, su reina, y estar a su lado. Es un relato duro de leer porque se desmorona un poco la idea que ten\u00edamos de la Reina Amberly gracias a los libros de The Selection, pero tampoco creo que debamos juzgar r\u00e1pidamente. No todas las parejas son perfectas y, como en la realidad, los libros tampoco pueden escapar de eso.

A book on Queen Amberly? Yes please!The Queen is the story of Queen Amberly, a glimpse of her life while she was competing in the selection for Prince Clarkson\u2019s hand. We get to see her life, her family and the real Amberly beneath all the fa\u00e7ade of grandiose we saw of her in The Selection. It was plainly obvious that Amberly was going to be the queen but it still was delightful to read of how she came to the throne. Prince Clarkson doesn\u2019t seem as bad as he was, as a king. But his thirst for power and his desire to have control is obvious here too, even though the impact is slightly lessened while seeing it through the rose-colored eyes of Amberly. Eitherway, this was fun and delightful :)"}], "description": "Before America Singer's story began, another girl came to the palace to compete for the hand of a different prince\u2026.Don't miss this digital original novella set in the captivating world of Kiera Cass's #1 New York Times bestselling Selection series.
