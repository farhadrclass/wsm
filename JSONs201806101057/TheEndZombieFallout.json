Don't worry, I won't post any spoilers.This week I have listened to the audio book versions of books 2 & 3 and I have to admit I am really enjoying this series. Depending on how the series turns out I may have to rethink the 4/5 stars I gave books 1, 2 and 4, and give them all a 5/5 star rating.Book 2 and its McDonalds story had me laughing my a** off and I had to pause it and regain my composure to continue. Some people, in their reviews have stated there is too much comedy attempted and failed within these pages. Like I said before, the authors sense of humor stands out in these books. But. To me it is mostly the main character's nature, a sarcastic nature that helps him to deal with all the high stress situations he is constantly in.Starting book 4 today. Can't get enough :)"}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10674028-angie", "userReview": "Still a great series, just read online that the rights have been sold for a series either movie or tv - hope they do it justice!!"}, {"userName": "Fangs for the Fantasy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5912634-fangs-for-the-fantasy", "userReview": "Pulled back from the brink of death, Michael Talbot is determined to protect his loved ones against not only the zombie plague, which has taken over the planet but the threat that Eliza, the vampire holds. Even a reinforced military base may not be enough to keep her at bay. The government may have Humvees, heavy artillery and helicopters loaded with missiles, but Eliza has an ace up her sleeve. Talbot depends on Tommy to give him the right information at the right time, but their pop tart loving guide, who hears Ryan Seacrest in his head, might not be as innocent as he seems.I cannot believe I made it through all three hundred and fifty-five pages of this novel. I am telling you right now Fangs readers, you owe me one. Michael Talbot continues to be an epic Gary Stu. Everyone around Talbot exists to constantly prop him up, and follow his lead. Even Alex and Paul, who have decided to travel in a different direction than Talbot, in order to find their families and avoid Eliza's clutches, spend their time chastising themselves for leaving Talbot, while talking about how amazing the trained marine is and alternately angsting about their disloyalty for abandoning Talbot in his hour of need. Brendan even pays for his abandonment of Talbot and the questioning of Talbot's leadership with his life. No one even bothers to try and think up any kind of plan on how to survive because they are all sure that somehow, Talbot will pull their asses out of the fire. Of course, Talbot has to get up to some practically superhuman shenanigans (that is when he isn't being saved by the family dog) but he somehow constantly manages to save everyone because that's what a man does - save his family. I spent much of the book hoping that a zombie would eat Talbot.There were quite a few female characters in this book but luckily, there really is no real need for them to be strong characters, when they can depend on Talbot. Tracy, Talbot's wife, is still alive and kicking but she never really gets into the action. Why would Michael bother to teach Tracy a practical skill like shooting a gun, when he can take his teenage sons out on missions against the zombies. Surely, a teenage boy has to be competent than an adult woman and besides, it teaches the young men that their job is to protect the womenfolk, just like dear old dad. Mike constantly acts like he is afraid of his shrewish wife but at no point does he bother to consult her for advice. Tracy exists to give Talbot something to save and is only humanized when dealing with her mother Carol, who has suddenly become frail and in need of Michael's protection, despite surviving by herself on a farm at the beginning of the apocalypse and her son Justin, who struggles to fight back against his link with Liza. Carol however does end up earning her keep, by pushing Mike's sister Lyndsey out of the kitchen. Everyone complains loudly about Lyndsey's cooking and none louder than Mike but since his job is saving the world, actually entering the kitchen and cooking for himself is inconceivable. Besides, it gives the women something to do while they are waiting to be saved.Then we have Nicole, who from the sounds of it is about six weeks pregnant. Nicole at this point is practically an invalid, who spends most of her time puking and expressing some kind of weakness. Nicole is in a sense nothing more than a walking womb but she's precious because she carries the future of the Talbot line. Nope, I couldn't make this shite up if I tried. This is par for the course because daughters are trouble - something Mike knows all to well.Rachael is 10 and she is my only daughter.\u201d \u201cBe thankful for that.\u201d The doc wouldn't understand the backhanded compliment at least not for another two and a half years when his daughter turned from a sweet daddy\u2019s little princess into a multi-headed demon from hell, as all teenage girls must. \u201cShe is without a shadow of a doubt, the strongest personality in our house. She is the most wonderfully devious of children. If there is trouble to find, she's not only in it but in it to win it.\u201d  I had learned the hard way after punishing my own boys way too much, that my daughter not only sought out trouble but was usually the root cause of it.  \u201cRachael's very smart but loves to tell you that she's not (the better to get away with things). She is a mini version of her mom, entirely too cute to be as cunning as she is. She scares the hell out of me because she is going to need to be locked in a closet VERY soon.\u201d Maybe that secret desire of all fathers to be able to lock their daughters away from testosterone infused boys could now be realized. So maybe a zombie invasion wasn\u2019t all bad. Women in this series exist to be shrews like Tracy and Mrs. Devereaux, wild precocious teenage girls in need of taming and weak victims in need of propping up like Carol, that is when they aren't in the kitchen doing their biologically mandated job. Yes, join me in a good eye roll.Read More"}, {"userName": "Balkron", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27874245-balkron", "userReview": "My Rating Scale:1 Star - Horrible book, It was so bad I stopped reading it. I have not read the whole book and wont2 Star - Bad book, I forced myself to finish it and do NOT recommend. I can't believe I read it once3 Star - Average book, Was entertaining but nothing special. No plans to ever re-read4 Star - Good Book, Was a really good book and I would recommend. I am Likely to re-read this book5 Star - GREAT book, A great story and well written. I can't wait for the next book. I Will Re-Read this one or more times.Number of times read: 1A promising series that failed to meet expectations. This is not even worth reading. Characters - The characters have become ridiculous. The first 2 books were entertaining, the remaining have been painful to read. This is the last book in the series that I intend to read.Story - Not much to say. Fart jokes, stupidity, bad planning, impossible escapes (I mean there is no way the escape used could have ever worked). Just a really bad book. If I hadn't enjoyed the first 2 books I would have never finished this book.Overall - Don't read it, don't touch it or it may infect you with stupidity."}, {"userName": "Timothy Ward", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4867952-timothy-ward", "userReview": "I am afraid my interest in this series has declined with each book, though each one has managed character and plot revelation moments and enough of the humor to keep me moving on to the next installment. Some of the prose gets on my nerves, from the excessive dialogue tags with adverbs and actions to excessive time with the main character bemoaning smells and his germophobia. I bought the fourth book pretty soon after finishing this, partly because the ending was good in book three, but also because I don't have any other zombie series that I enjoy as much as this. The main character is more likable that any new series I try, even if he annoys me sometimes with his complaints about dog farts and touching dirty surfaces."}, {"userName": "Hana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5200387-hana", "userReview": "The haters of this series crack me up almost as much as the books do. It's hard to imagine that there are zombie snobs out there, but...I find Mike Talbot's narration of his often absurd tales of survival too much fun. I have listened to the audiobooks since book 1 and they couldn't have picked a better narrator to bring his (and all the other) characters to life.If you're looking for a deep, dark scientifically accurate zombie tale, this series is not for you. But if you want an action-packed series that has you cracking up at every turn (and far too often relating!), then you should enjoy the Zombie Fallout (so far, I have). If you can, listen to the audiobooks - it's worth it!"}, {"userName": "A.

I think the series is up to seven books, not including the third half step. Michael\u2019s zombie saga continues. Rather than provide a summary of what happens, go back, read the first book in the series, and enjoy. The crazy thing is that as much as I think I won\u2019t like the next addition, I always do. It\u2019s a solid 5 stars for me, because somehow, you can\u2019t help but fall in love with the family and root for their survival. It\u2019s zombie with a quirky twist. Yes, you should read from the beginning. Tufo does not do the best job at creating standalone titles, and no, don\u2019t read if you have a weak stomach. Violence? Maybe, but it\u2019s more the gory aftermath that\u2019s an issue for weak abdomens. Tufo never goes excessive unless it has an impact. Read it if you\u2019re a zombie fan! You will not be disappointed, but again, start from the beginning of the series."}, {"userName": "Sara Pestell", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4670804-sara-pestell", "userReview": "Once you get sucked into the story, you just can't put his books down, it's like reading someone's diary that you found in the attic..... from long ago....
