This facsimile edition brings this seminal work on conceptual continuity to a new generation of fans who have outgrown the ordinary. This cheesy little home-made book was prepared for the amusement of people who already enjoy Zappa music. It is not for intellectuals or other dead people. It is designed to answer one of the more troubling questions related to conceptual continuity: 'How do all of these things that don't have anything to do with each other fit together, forming a larger absurdity?' This is a story book. It is not a rock & roll biography. This is the only REAL & OFFICIAL FRANK ZAPPA BOOK*. All other books attempting to trade on my name are unauthorized and full of misinformation. This book is dedicated to all of the fans who have made the last 20 years** of large-scale absurdities possible.A\" Frank Zappa * This and The Real Frank Zappa Book, published in 1989. ** Plus yet another 20, give or take a few years.", "title": "Them or Us", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1165294.Them_or_Us", "average": 3.59, "cover": "", "reviews": 0, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22302.Frank_Zappa", "name": "Frank Zappa"}], "type": ["Music"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1165294.Them_or_Us", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39671.The_Real_Frank_Zappa_Book", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39675.Apostrophe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39678.Hot_Rats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6465188-frank-zappa-guitar-book", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12621096-one-size-fits-all"]}
