It seemed to try to tell the story of too many people without making me care all that much for many of them. That said, a highlight of the book was the friendship that developed between Hortense and Minna. I'd like to have known more about Hortense, her background, her marriage, her children and more about Minna, too. I'd also liked to have known more about Nicky's time in Italy, especially his emotional growth. Oh well. Maybe I'm just never going to love another AT work as much as I did the Big Stone Gap trilogy."}, {"userName": "Gloria Bernal", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1066448-gloria-bernal", "userReview": "Sitting down with a new Trigiani novel, is like opening a box of chocolates. Not quite sure what\u2019s under the coating, but knowing it will be sweet and tasty. It\u2019s like visiting an old friend. I know I\u2019m in for some delights, some words of wisdom, a tear or two, some chuckles, and some salivating in these Italian kitchens. Believable characters in believable circumstances. The novel will take you from South Philly to Roseto, Italy, its sister city, Roseto, PA and to New York, in 1949, post WWII, a remarkable era. On her website she states that she hopes her novels honor working people. Indeed they do. This one is based around the stage and local actors portraying Shakespeare-themed plays in a small Italian neighborhood in South Philly. Borelli\u2019s is the name of the theater, now run by Calla Borelli, daughter of an icon of a man who has kept the theater going through good times and tough times, and this opens during a rough time. Not enough money to keep the theatre maintenance and salaries going, and fewer people buying tickets to see the plays. Calla (I love that name) is named after the favorite flower of her mother, deceased when this opens. Calla is a strong, hard-working young woman wanting to continue the theater in her beloved father\u2019s footsteps. The other main protagonist is Nicky, a stage hand who drives a cab as a real job, but who\u2019s love for the theater, pulls him to make major changes in his life. Much of the novel revolves around the aunts and uncles that he lives with, as he was orphaned at a young age. The dialogue between the cast of characters is in itself a delight. I won\u2019t spoil it for you, dear reader, there are many little gems of wisdom. The main theme is the bonds we build with family, those that are blood, and those that seem like they are. I loved Hortense, the dispatcher/western-union-lady at the cab company, and surrogate mother for Nicky. How she handled her \"color\" and how she handled her husband in the latter half of the novel was a delight for me. And the marinara sauce recipe she got from Minna, which they call \"gravy\"... Can't wait to try the recipe that's included in the book. Be patient during the first half, it\u2019s building up the character profiles, and as this novel involves two sides of an Italian family, there are plenty of them. The 2nd half will have you turning the pages faster. I received a complimentary pre-release copy for the purpose of posting an unbiased review, and am happy to recommend it.

I truly adored The Shoemaker's Wife. Still, I've also glanced at other novels she penned and felt immediately turned off. But, the adoration won out and I happily signed up to receive an advance edition of this novel (which came with lipstick!).Although it takes a few trips...including to Italy and to a small town in PA...this book's heart is in Philadelphia. Nicky is growing up in a bustling family, adopted by an Aunt and Uncle when his mother passed and raised alongside their three sons. He eventually becomes part of the family taxi business, a thriving affair in 1949 as the economy bustles after the war, with their main competition coming from the uncle's estranged brother. Still, Nicky finds himself drawn to a small struggling theater company and works there part-time for years before revealing the secret to his longtime girlfriend just as he's thrust onto the stage when the company is shorthanded. This story develops alongside the story of a small PA town getting ready to welcome an important visitor from the town's struggling sister city in Italy. And, well, to avoid saying too much (which some summaries do), I'll just say it all gets thrown in a jar and shaken.I really wanted to love this book. I did FEEL the place, possibly more vividly since I'm half-Italian and grew up just outside of Philadelphia, and that's a credit to Trigiani. She paints several places beautifully. While her characters are interesting, they don't feel nearly as real as the places do. I certainly cheered for Nicky, but I got a bit weary as the story mixed him up into plots that seemed thrown together at random. It would have been a much better book if it was, well, several books. I could have handled some loose connections tying together a trilogy, though even then I feel like the overlaps would have needed to be minimized. There's just too much going on and Nicky is in the middle of all of it, when he just shouldn't be.There are some great aspects of this book. As I've mentioned, she's a master of place. And I just loved Hortense, the taxi company's dispatcher, although her storyline follows Nicky's to the small town and loses me a bit (hers is a good tale, just felt too forced). And Calla, the daughter of the aging owner of the theater, is a pretty cool lady too. But, the fact that there was too MUCH, too MANY plots tied too loosely together, dominated and knocks what could have been a four-star novel down to three."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38191133-lisa", "userReview": "I would rate this book a 2 1/2. It was enjoyable, and Adriana Trigiani is one of my favorite authors, and I have enjoyed many of her other books, but Kiss Carlo was not one of my favorites. It dragged on, and although I liked the way the book came together at the end, it was too abrupt. One minute Nicky is in New York, the next he is marrying Calla. The last few books by Adriana Trigiani have been disappointing, I am hoping that the next one is better."}, {"userName": "Ashley Tighe stona", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17616211-ashley-tighe-stona", "userReview": "I'm disappointed for the first time ever.

The story takes place in a little Italian town, South Philly and New York in the United States.In Southern Philly, there are two brothers feuding over land that had belonged to their father when he was alive. This feud splits the large family in two. Both brothers have a cab company, and one brother adds a service to deliver telegrams. The wives and cousins are now separated by this family feud.Nick, an orphan is brought up in one of the families by his aunt and uncle. He drives a taxi, and delivers telegrams. He finds work also in a small theater company, and finds that he loves acting. Nick has been engaged for seven years and feels something is missing. Nick decides to pursue an acting career in New York City.I love the way that Adriana Trigiani writes about the love, encouragement and support of family. I enjoyed the author's descriptions of family traditions, and the food and festivities.The characters are described as complex and complicated. In \"Kiss Carlo\", the author describes Italian, Jewish, Polish and Black families in this time period, and how well they get along. The characters are accepting of one another.The author writes about family, friends,loyalty, love and hope. You can see growth in the characters. This is a wonderful book, and I would highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Alissa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742439-alissa", "userReview": "Not quite the family saga that she's written before - focuses mainly on late 1940s and early 1950s.

It\u2019s the story of a large Italian American family that\u2019s set in Philadelphia in the 1950s. When brothers Dom and Mike have a falling out, they form rival cab companies and go their separate ways but they\u2019re always aware of what the other is doing. I admit to being somewhat biased when it comes to Trigiani\u2019s books but I think this one may be her best one yet. I was charmed and captivated by this well-crafted family saga of love, drama, and loyalty all tied together with a Shakespearean theme. (It\u2019s not necessary to know anything about Shakespeare to love this book.) As I\u2019ve come to expect from Trigiani\u2019s work, the characters are fabulous, the setting is well researched, and the dialogue is top notch.

A beautiful slice of Italian life in Philadelphia circa 1940's."}, {"userName": " \u2665\u2665Mari\u2665\u2665 ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3132623-mari", "userReview": "NOTE: I received a complimentary ARC of this enthralling novel from TLC Book Tours for an honest (and honestly enthusiastic!) review.This wonderful novel was my introduction to Adriana Trigiani, who is now one of my favorite authors! With Kiss Carlo, she has delivered a totally riveting, compelling story that actually plays like a movie from the year in which these events take place -- 1949.I was so captivated by the book's cover, when I first saw it, that I decided to take the risk of going outside my comfort zone; I don't normally read historical family sagas. I'm so very glad that I did in this case, though!I was immediately swept up into this richly-told story of a large Italian-American family living in South Philadelphia. The evocative writing, the combination of drama and humor, along with the idiosyncratic characters, all came together to make this a totally exhilarating reading experience for me! I quickly fell in love with the world so skillfully evoked by Trigiani, to the point that I am now feeling nostalgic for it.One of the fascinating things about this novel is that the author interweaves some profound reflections on one's destiny with the other plot elements.Nicky Castone, the novel's central character, drives a cab for the Palazzini Cab Company, owned by his family. But one day, he is suddenly forced to face the fact that mortality is an inescapable part of the human experience. This epiphany makes him aware, for the first time, that he's simply always gone blithely along with whatever his family expected of him. He suddenly realizes that he wants much more out of life. Nicky's questioning is one that many readers, including myself, can easily relate to. However, Trigiani does not focus on this to the exclusion of all else. Instead, she skillfully develops the plot into a series of tragi-comical events that upset the status quo in the Palazzini family, as well as the DePino family. The results are paradoxically hilarious as well as heartbreaking.Nicky is such a relatable, funny, irrepressible, and totally honest character! It took a lot of courage for him to call off his seven-year engagement to Peachy DePino and go off on a self-searching quest. (Although this quest was, comically enough, propelled by the prospect of facing Peachy's furious father.) Nicky had already discovered that he loved acting at Borelli's Theater, where he works alongside Calla Borelli, the original owner's daughter, who directs all the plays performed there. Although Nicky does feel attracted to Calla, he considers her a friend, as she has her own boyfriend.Calla is a very compelling character in her own right. She is passionately dedicated to the Borelli Theater, which is in danger of going under. She is also very devoted to her father, whom she cares for at the house they've shared for years. Furthermore, Calla is a very strong, determined young woman.The relationship between Calla and Nicky plays out gradually, and I loved that they were friends first. Sometimes \"love at first sight\" can work, but other times not. In this case, both of these characters came to realize that they had unconsciously loved each other all along, although they did the honorable thing, since they were committed to other people. Their mutual passion for the theater, and especially Shakespeare's plays, plus their similar outlook on life, ultimately brought them together, after they had each taken separate paths. The \"supporting cast\" Trigiani has assembled is just perfect, from Nicky's Aunt Jo and Uncle Dom, who took him in as an orphan, to his brothers and sisters-in-law, to the people of Roseto, a small town located about 60 miles to the north of Philadelphia. Some of the memorable characters living there are Mamie Confalone, who plays a small part in Nicky's life, and the very funny mother and daughter duo of 'wanna-be femme fatales', Cha Cha and Rosalba Tutolola. The most interesting of all these secondary characters, however, is Hortense Mooney, an African-American woman who has been working as a dispatcher and telegraph operator at the Palazzini Cab Company for the last twenty years. Hortense is a guardian angel of sorts to Nicky, to whom she gives her unconditional love, as well as emotional support. She's actually like a second mother to him, and he really values her advice and help.I loved Hortense's wit, her frequent references to Eleanor Roosevelt -- a woman I have long admired -- and her shrewd observations on the Palazzini family interactions, as well as life in general. I also greatly enjoyed her budding friendship with Minna, a lonely woman who lives in Roseto. I would love it if Trigiani wrote a spinoff novel about Hortense! Minna is a very poignant character. She has actually lived in a self-made prison since the death of her husband. When Hortense arrives in Roseto, and the two women get to know each other, Minna begins to change. This is a very touching part of the novel.Sam Borelli, Calla's father, was another great secondary character. I loved his quiet strength, as well as his close relationship to his daughter, Calla. Although the reader doesn't get to know him as well as Hortense, his influence is felt by the actors at the theater. He has shaped their lives in very important ways, thus leaving a legacy of love for the theater that will survive the impact of the new television technology of the time.This love of the theater is a very important aspect of this novel that makes me even more enthusiastic about the story! I especially like the fact that the actors at the Borelli Theater exclusively perform Shakespeare's plays. Nicky ends up acting in \"Twelfth Night\", which is very much pertinent to the plot of Kiss Carlo, as it, too, involves a case of mistaken identity. Trigiani includes several quotes from the play, thus making her love of Shakespeare a part of her novel. She skillfully interweaves the action in the play with that of her plot, thus creating an interesting contrast between the events on the stage and those in the novel.I have to add that I couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for Peachy. The fact that she's a rather shallow, conventional person didn't stop me from feeling this way, either. I liked that Trigiani evaded the very easy route of making her a totally one-dimensional character. She loved Nicky, if in her own limited way. Trigiani handled the conflict between these two characters beautifully, avoiding too much drama and pathos.Although Nicky's escapade does create some very funny reading, this is a well-balanced book, as there are some losses, as well. Even though this saddened me, it did make the novel more realistic, and the characters even more appealing. It was heartwarming to see how they supported each other through these situations. The most important quality of a great novel is how deeply the reader is touched, to what degree the reader feels that they have actually lived another life in the reading of that novel. In Kiss Carlo, Trigiani certainly achieves this quality. Readers will feel as if they, too, had lived in South Philly in 1949, sharing in all the crazy, humorous, and sad interactions of the Palazzini family, as well as getting the feel of what it means to be an Italian-American.I did not want this novel to end, and am already looking forward to reading it again in the future! These characters are just too unforgettable and likeable for me to simply put this book on a shelf and never dip into it again!

Nicky secretly spends his evenings in Calla's Shakespeare theater, where he does all kinds of different jobs behind the scenes. When he gets the chance to act, because there is nobody else, he finally finds his passion. He continues following it, but after a disastrous job Nicky has to make some tough choices. Will he stay and work for his family or will he go away and follow his heart?Dominic and Mike are brothers. They've been fighting over an inheritance for many years. They split up the family company and their feud has kept their once so close families apart. Will they ever been able to mend fences and realize that family is more important than property or money?Calla wants to continue her father's legacy. He started the Shakespeare theater she's working so hard for. The plays are her pride and joy and she loves directing them. However, just like her father Calla isn't good with money. The theater's proceeds are meager and she doesn't know how to make her business profitable. She pays her actors and tries to cut back on everything else, but will it be enough to keep her beloved business going? Is there room for love in her life when so much is at stake?Kiss Carlo is a beautiful story about family, friendships, love and dreams. It has a lot of fabulous main characters. Adriana Trigiani has made them all multidimensional and equally interesting, which is something I really enjoyed about her book. Nicky has to find his passion, Calla has found hers, but needs to find love and Dominic and Mike need to find peace. Kiss Carlo has a large number of characters, so there are many more beautifully described personalities, which I found a real treat, and they all have a special place in my heart.Adriana Trigiani writes about people from different generations and each of them has their own story and background. I love reading about families and Kiss Carlo is a fantastic story. It's dynamic, entertaining, unpredictable and original. I fell in love with this book from the first page. I love it when a book is so good that the characters will stay with me for a very long time. Nicky and his family and friends definitely fall into this category and I highly recommend their brilliant stories. Kiss Carlo is a complex novel filled with wisdom, life experience, aspirations and reality.

always look forward to a new Adriana Trigiani book. I feel like I am an honorary Italian when I read her books, filled with family, food, romance and people with a good work ethic.Trigiani's latest novel, Kiss Carlo, is a big, beautiful novel, stuffed with all of the above and more. The story begins in Roseto Valfatore, Italy in 1949, with Carlo, the ambassador, heading to Roseto, Pennsylvania to seek help from some Italian-Americans in rebuilding their road.From there, we meet the Palazzini brothers of Philadelphia, Dom and Mike, who once owned a taxi company together, but after a falling out, they now have competing taxi companies and no longer speak to each other.Dom is the frugal one, and his wife Jo has spent her life caring for their home and (now grown) children, and her nephew Nicky who lost his parents at an early age. Jo is the kind of woman who makes homemade pasta in the basement, and irons everyone's underwear.Mike is the flashier guy, and he has a more successful taxi business. His wife Nancy has the fancy clothes, and visits the hair salon weekly. The sisters-in-law used to be close, but because of the feud no longer speak. It's almost Shakespearean, you could say.Speaking of Shakespeare, Nicky drives Uncle Dom's taxi by day and by night volunteers at a local Shakespearean theater, run by Calla Borelli, who is trying to keep the doors to her father's theater open. This new television craze has hurt live theater.What's interesting in Kiss Carlo is that the main character is Nicky, a man. Nicky feels a little lost, even though his aunt and uncle love him very much. He is engaged to Peachy, a woman who feels her time is running out before she is officially a spinster.When Nicky gets the opportunity to perform onstage at the theater, he comes alive. Now he knows what he wants to do- be an actor. Peachy, however, will not hear of it.There is a lot going on in Kiss Carlo, and watching how Trigiani weaves the story and characters together is just amazing. It's like seeing someone take a skein of yarn and a few minutes later a beautiful blanket materializes.There are so many great characters in this story- Jo Palazzini, Calla, Nicky, Mamie Confalone- but my favorite is Hortense. Hortense is a black woman who works as a dispatcher for Dom's taxi service. She has been with them for years, and she brooks no nonsense. Don't ask Hortense what she thinks unless you really want to know.Hortense finds herself involved in a crazy caper with Nicky, and through that experience she meets a woman who will change her life. I love that Hortense wants a better life for herself and when she sees an opportunity, she works hard and uses her brains to make it happen. (It's that work ethic that shows up in every one of Trigiani's books.)I had the chance to speak briefly with Adriana and I told her that I think Hortense is my all-time favorite character of hers. She told me that Hortense was a real person, and she actually shows up in the Acknowledgements page.Soap opera fans will get a kick out of the fact that uber-producer Gloria Monty has a cameo appearance in this book. I told you, there is a lot packed into this book.I gave a copy of Kiss Carlo to one of my Italian-American friends, and she read the 500+ page book in two days, telling me she couldn't put it down. I totally agree with her, this is one of Adriana Trigiani's best books.Whether you're from a big family or just yearn to be, Kiss Carlo is for you. And if you take this book to the beach, bring along plenty of sunscreen because you will not be able to stop reading it until you finish. I give it my highest recommendation."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52277469-jane", "userReview": "The cover is to die for and you can judge a book by its cover. I'm a Adriana Trigiani fan and have read all of them. She never disappoints. I'm so happy that I received an ARC thanks to a book blogger page on Facebook. Even though this book was 500+ pages, it was fast reading and these two families meshed well together -- except for the brothers Mike & Dom who had a falling out almost 20 years ago until almost the end of the book. So much going on in this book and not just with the families either. The theater, the cab business, the Western Union business, the workers, the cast of The Borelli Theater, the owner and the Director of it too.

In order to be true to himself, he needs to turn his back on many of the trappings of a typical Italian American life for a male at that time.

He is an orphan and his aunt has taken him in, so he lives with his extended family in South Philly. His Uncle Dom's cab company competes with his estranged Uncle Mike's cab company in true South Philly fashion as they haven't talked to his other family in years due to a feud. Things seems to be going well for Nicky. He is engaged to be married to Peachy, he works at the theater which brings him joy, and he has a steady job at the cab company. One night during the Twelfth Night play at the theater he replaces an ailing actor and he is in a scene with Calla. Sparks fly, but what should he do about it? Should he go against his family's expectations and follow his heart and his dream of acting or should be marry Peachy, live in South Philly and the rest is history? Kiss Carlo by Adriana Trigiani has it all. It has family drama, hilarious moments, quiet moments, and reflections of family life from days gone by.

As most of my friends know, I am a \"brand loyalist\" when it comes to Adriana Trigiani for many reasons, among them my Italian-American heritage and the fact that she is a masterful storyteller. In my opinion, identity on multiple levels is an over-arching theme in most of her books. In \"Kiss Carlo,\" she explores ethnic identity and self-knowledge in the post-WW II Italian-American community. The principal characters are complicated people with back stories that reflect the aspirations, as well as the struggles and flawed thinking, of the period. An interesting \"conceit\" (in the literary sense) is the \"role\" of \"Twelfth Night\" in the story. Just for fun, you may want to \"brush up your Shakespeare,\" as the song goes. Settings are always important in Trigiani's books, and \"Kiss Carlo\" will be especially entertaining (and enlightening) for anyone familiar with the Italian community of South Philadelphia and/or Roseto, PA, where the author also set one of my favorites, \"Queen of the Big Time.\" I'm grateful for the opportunity to read the ARE and will look forward to the final edition on June 20."}, {"userName": "Betty", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3541694-betty", "userReview": "I love family sagas, and Adriana Trigiani is a master at them. \u201cKiss Carlo\u201d is a story of family, romance, loyalty, trust, dreams, and tradition. It opens in May 1949 in South Philly after the men have returned from war. Dom and Mike Palazzini, brothers in an Italian-American family have not spoken for an estimated 16 years. Nicky Castone, orphaned at a young age, has lived with his uncle Dom and aunt Jo since he was five years old. He drives a taxi for the family cab company and delivers telegrams for Hortense Mooney. He has been engaged to Peachy for seven years. Nicky has never told Peachy about his evening job with a small Shakespeare theatre company run by Calla Borelli. One night when he has to fill in for an absent actor he finds himself bitten by the acting bug. Working with the determined and passionate Calla, Nicky finally realizes that something is missing in his life. He recognizes that he does not want to marry Peachy. Nicky struggles to find his place in the world as he flees to Roseto, Pennsylvania while impersonating an Italian ambassador. This then leads him to the hillside village of Roseto Valfortore in Italy. Upon his return to the US, he announces to his family that he is moving to New York City to pursue an acting career. It took me a while to grasp who all characters were as all of Dom and Jo\u2019s sons and their wives and children still live with them. The characters are beautifully brought to life, revealing their strengths, their flaws, their backstories.

It\u2019s the post-WWII years and people are optimistic about getting back to finding the American dream and all that entails. Trigiani\u2019s characters are relatable yet sometimes larger than life. They have important lessons to learn and are mostly grateful when they do. Most important was finding one\u2019s true purpose and how to recognize it when it appeared. As serious as that sounds there are also laugh-out-loud moments. As in all of her novels, Trigiani\u2019s attention to detailed descriptions left no question in my mind what the setting in any given scene looked like. Her novels often seem cinematic to me and I\u2019d love to see this one on the big screen. With a nod to Shakespeare and Italian operas, Trigiani has written a very heartfelt and entertaining novel.

It is too long for the light story and wanders here, there and everywhere. So much fluff thrown in for no apparent reason.

I enjoyed the family interactions and at times chuckled with them and at other times pitied them too as sometimes they let petty things and grievances stand in the way of meaningful family relationships. Especially the relationships between brothers who should have been supportive of each other. This book was not at all what I had expected, delightfully so. It is a big book. Weighing in at over 500 pages, I must admit I was a bit intimidated by it. There are a lot of characters in this book and lots of details that I did find myself skimming over just due to time constraints. The author knows her way around words and I did enjoy her writing, however I was really craving Italian food while reading this.The love story was cute and fun to watch grow. I knew who I was shipping for and I had to be patient as it unfolded. The setting of the Shakespearean theater and the play that was so important to our heroine makes me want to pick up Twelfth Night and give that a read as well.

I also have privilege to know my Italian roots and to know some of my extended family in the old country; thus continuing the traditions and legacy of my amazing, crazy, overwhelming and beautiful family. There are some things about being Italian American that can be overwhelming such as big, loud family gatherings, or everyone in the family wanting to know what everyone else is doing, all the time. Yet, there are many things that are amazingly warm about growing up Italian American, like strong family connections, traditions like Sunday dinner, and holiday traditions that I continue to treasure. What I love about Adriana Trigiani's books is she always crafts this duality of bel paese (old country) and the new established traditions in her novels. Yet, at the heart of them is la famiglia, which resonates strongly with me. In Kiss Carlo, she captures this perfectly with the Palazzini family and ties it in with a bit of the Bard. Matrimonio perfetto! This was a fun summer read. I'll end with this. There are two schools of thought amongst Italian Americans and it was repeated over and over in this novel. That is gravy vs. sauce. It's a sort of east coast vs. west coast thing. I'll just say in my family it's sauce. Gravy?

The Palazzini Cab Company & Western Union Telegraph Office, owned and operated by Dominic Palazzini and his three sons, is flourishing: business is good, they\u2019re surrounded by sympathetic wives and daughters-in-law, with grandchildren on the way. But a decades-long feud that split Dominic and his brother Mike and their once-close families sets the stage for a re-match.\u00a0Amidst the hoopla,\u00a0the arrival of an\u00a0urgent telegram from Italy upends the life of Nicky Castone (Dominic and his wife\u2019s orphaned nephew) who lives and works with his Uncle Dom and his family. Nicky decides, at 30, that he wants more\u2014more than just a job driving Car #4 and more than his longtime fianc\u00e9e Peachy DePino, a bookkeeper, can offer. When he admits to his fianc\u00e9e that he\u2019s been secretly moonlighting at the local Shakespeare theater company, Nicky finds himself\u00a0drawn to the stage, its colorful players and to the determined Calla Borelli, who inherited the enterprise from her father, Nicky must choose between the conventional life his family expects of him or chart a new course and risk losing everything he cherishes.From the dreamy\u00a0mountaintop village of Roseto Valfortore in Italy, to the vibrant streets of South Philly, to the close-knit enclave of Roseto, Pennsylvania, to New York City during the birth of the golden age of television,\u00a0Kiss Carlo\u00a0is a powerful, inter-generational story that celebrates the ties that bind, while staying true to oneself when all hope seems lost.Told against the backdrop of some of Shakespeare\u2019s greatest comedies, this novel brims with romance as long buried secrets are revealed, mistaken identities are unmasked, scores are settled, broken hearts are mended and true love reigns. Trigiani\u2019s consummate storytelling skill and her trademark wit, along with a dazzling cast of characters will enthrall readers. Once again, the author has returned to her own family garden to create an unforgettable feast.\u00a0Kiss Carlo\u00a0is a jubilee, resplendent with hope, love, and the abiding power of la famiglia.", "title": "Kiss Carlo", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30531819-kiss-carlo", "average": 3.63, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1491120799l/30531819.jpg", "reviews": 761, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9219.Adriana_Trigiani", "name": "Adriana Trigiani"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Romance", "Historical", "Audiobook"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30531819-kiss-carlo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30531551-kiss-carlo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30653765-kiss-carlo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31752021-kiss-carlo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13127599-the-shoemaker-s-wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58822.Big_Stone_Gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52471.Big_Cherry_Holler", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60057.Lucia_Lucia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3673357-very-valentine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
