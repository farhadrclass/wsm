I almost have no words. I had no idea what to write so I've holding off on writing this review for quite a while. I thought maybe I would just give it 5 stars and leave it at that. Because every time I started to write this review I got emotional.How have I not read any books from Kelly Rimmer before?The story is told from the point of view of Olivia and Ivy. Olivia is a young mother to Zoe and she's recently suffered what everyone refers to as \"The Tragedy\", her husband David's recent death. Ivy is David's mother. The chapters alternate between Olivia and Ivy.There were many secrets in David and Olivia's relationship....Olivia tells us about David, his death, their marriage and we are slowly given little snippets of information that make the reader well aware of what kind of man David was. But this is just the beginning and the way the story unfolds is compelling and heartbreaking.From Ivy, we first hear about her early life as a new mother to David. Then as the book continues we learn more about her life, marriage and her relationship with David as he grows. Her husband, Wyatt and son, David were her sole purpose in life. We also hear her perception of David and Olivia's relationship.Olivia's story is mostly in the present but still contains flashbacks to many things Ivy refers to in her chapters. Olivia explains that most people try to avoid talking about what happened. But part of her wants to talk about it.\n\"I just want to say his name. I want to scream it in anger, and I want to wail it in grief.\"\nI was totally immersed in both perspectives. I didn't find any of it redundant. At times the switch in perspectives gave me a break when things got very emotional. But there were also times when both perspectives were intense.The character development was phenomenal. There were so many awesome and wonderful characters. Olivia\u2019s parents and sister. Her family\u2019s love for her made my heart swell. Ingrid, the real estate agent with a heart of gold. Ellen, the daycare owner was one of the most kind-hearted, loving, and PERFECT characters.You know when they say a novel has you on a roller coaster of emotions. I've probably said it before too, but honestly I don't know how many different feelings I felt while listening to this audio-book. The kind of book that pull you in, grips you, holds you, wrings you out, leaving you a quivering mess of emotions...The narrator of this audio-book was phenomenal. Her voice able to take on each character and what they were saying and feeling at that moment was amazing to me. I HEARD the pain in Olivia's voice and it went straight to my heart. I HEARD the rage in David's voice and it terrified me. I HEARD the kindness in Seb's voice and it brought me to tears...I know this may sound like a devastating read, and it is very emotional. However, there were also many genuine moments of happiness, laughter, and hope.I like to think I can see things coming, but there was so much in this novel that I didn't see and would never have guessed. And even if I had figured things out, I still would have been left reeling. A thought-provoking novel in which everything that happened, really COULD happen. It made me think of how we parent, how we raise and protect our children. And that excusing or ignoring terrible behavior is not protecting them.When I first started this audio-book, I honestly thought it was going to take me some time to get through it, only because I find it hard to do other things while listening to an audio-book. However, it had me gripped and was NOT letting me go. It didn't care that it was already 4am...After the audio ended and there was just dead air, I couldn't move. I don't know how long I sat there. It was five am. I was gutted, raw and so emotional, my eyes puffy from crying.I wanted to wake up my daughter, call my mother, call my best friend, call SOMEBODY to talk about this book...Outstanding read! I can't recommend it enough!"}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Audiobook- narrated by Brigid Lohrey....**Excellent reader!!!Anyone who remembers \u201cMrs. Levy\u201d, from the book, \u201cThe Ladies Auxiliary\u201d.....might have related to Goodreads-friend, Violet, when she wrote....\u201dI thought blood was going to burst through my skin and boil over\u201d. Mrs. Levy was a vile character. Most readers felt gut wrenching emotions towards her. I\u2019m here to say....Mrs. Levy met her match in Kelly Rimmer\u2019s novel, \u201cA Mother\u2019s Confession\u201d, with *Ivy*. Ivy will have steam coming out of your eyes and ears. .....Ivy is a mother-In-law-from HELL! .....Ivy\u2019s son, David, can do no wrong. .....Ivy has no filters.....Ivy felt that if Olivia, her daughter-in-law- should kiss his feet in gratitude to land a man like HER SON. Olivia - who was working toward her degree at a great University - was a plain Jane next to her handsome perfect stud-son. ha! It was Olivia that should drop out of school - of course - if she loved David - and move back to David\u2019s hometown ( to be near mommy-dearest). .....Ivy could not \u2018part\u2019 with her son. She enabled narcissism in him from the time David was a child. \u201cDavid was SPECIAL-BEYOND SPECIAL\u201d.....at the cost of anyone\u2019s else\u2019s well-being. .....Ivy was terrific at criticizing Olivia.... covertly, and overtly. .....Ivy was made of nightmares!!!!At the beginning of the story, Olivia mentions \u201cThe Tragedy\u201d.......but we never get the full facts of that tragedy until close to the end .......Olivia is engaged in a process of healing\u2014 having been a battered wife \u2014horrific cruelty. With the help of a therapist - Olivia begins to move forward, demonstrating courage and bravery. I absolutely admired her strength. In this story, we also get a clear look at a controlling mother - who is in denial - of her son\u2019s criminal domestic violence. This might be the most frustrating and fascinating part of the entire book. I mean, you just wanted to slap this woman at times. What was wrong with her? Really? What makes people like HER? Ivy....you and Mrs. Levy are THE MOST hated female characters I\u2019ve read all year! Nasty villains - Just nasty! \u2014yet: credit to the author for creating a character like Ivy for us to study. An excellent audiobook.... it holds your attention. A little editing would have been ok with me too. The story dragged longer than needed - but it\u2019s easy to forgive - this is drama 101.

It was good, but also INCREDIBLY frustrating. It's not a spoiler to say this is the story of Olivia, a woman whose husband badly abused her. It is told in alternating chapters by her and his mother, Ivy. The story unfolds with more and more details of the abuse and the vile character of David being revealed. I felt for Olivia, even though I struggled to understand how she could stay with a man who treated her like this when she had a caring family nearby and a good job with a kind employer. It's probably not unrealistic, but still so frustrating to hear her being mistreated and growing more and more desperate, yet unable or unwilling to leave him.Ivy, David's mother is a total disgrace of a human being. She knows her son is probably abusing his wife, but she just accepts it because she is obsessed with him being perfect. I know every mother loves her child, but you don't have to foster their psychotic behavior if you see it even at an early age. I could find no excuse at all for Ivy, and I really just loathed her and self-righteousness and willingness to see past the most obvious signs of her son's terrible behavior. The more I read, the more I loathed Ivy for her blind loyalty and stupidity when it came to her monster of a son. Her delusion caused real damage, and even in the end, I didn't feel she had changed as she should have.I think because this story seemed quite real, the characters felt especially frustrating. I just wanted to take them by the shoulders and shake sense into them!This aspect aside, I do think Rimmer has told an important story and I think her decision to tell it through the voices of the two women in the abuser's lifewas very clever and well done. The one, his mother, could see him only through rose tinted glasses, while the other, his wife, grew wise to him, but struggled to do anything about it. The story is very absorbing and the twist at the end really came as yet another shock!I have no first-hand experience of abuse, and know how lucky I am for that, so reading this story was very disturbing yet sadly believable. The characters had near perfect lives on the surface, but beneath that surface the darkest events were taking place. I wish people who were being abused didn't feel shamed by society to speak up and seek help, and I wish victims of abuse were always met with compassion and an open ear. Sadly, neither are often the case. Victims are often treated like fools who have brought the blows and cruelty upon themselves or who are weak in their bodies or minds, and that mentality is so entirely wrong. When those being abused know there is a place to go and there are people who will believe and help them, it saves lives. I don't want to ramble and ramble and get on my high horse, but this book really upset and moved me, and my dear Goodreads friends reading this, I am afraid you are bearing the brunt of my emotional distress in this regard;-)Despite all of this, it was a good book and I am glad I read it. I just wasn't expecting something quite so intense. I will definitely keep my eye on this author, but first I need a little time to get over this book!Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com"}, {"userName": "Tracy Fenton", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18478389-tracy-fenton", "userReview": "My thanks to Netgalley for the honour of reading this simply incredible book. A Mother's Confession is an emotional roller coaster and one of the only books I didn't want to read purely because I didn't want it to finish. This is a story about a man called David, a husband, father and son, told from the viewpoint of Olivia, his wife and Ivy, his over protective mother.

I didn't count on this book making me cry! Mind blowing good story. It's not a particularly long or short book, but I blew right through it. I was desperate to find out how it ended for Olivia and Ivy. Very moving. One part struck me towards the beginning. (I even made an update about it on GoodReads.) \"Boys will be boys\" is what Ivy says after her young son David roughly yanks on a little girls ponytail for no reason. He is gently told that it wasn't nice, while the little girl is scolded by her own mother for shrieking in response to the pain and surprise. This is only the beginning of the strange relationship between David and Ivy. While many parents are quite biased on their children's looks or skills, she is excessive. He can do no wrong. He is perfect. Any problems he has at school or later on, with relationships, are no fault of his own. It's everyone else that doesn't measure up. And certainly none of the girls he dates as he ages measure up to her ideals. They aren't pretty enough, aren't dedicated enough to perfect David. But David is not perfect.David meets Olivia in college, and she's just another girl to Ivy. She assumes the girl won't last long. They never do, and this woman isn't the most physically impressive to her, despite her smarts and charm. They go through some difficult times, but they don't separate. Eventually, it becomes obvious that Olivia is here to stay. They get married, and have been seeing each other for over ten years when David suddenly kills himself. Olivia gave birth to Zoe, their long-awaited daughter, only months before. The book switches back and forth from Ivy to Olivia in the past and present, detailing how everything got to that point. I received a copy of this book from Net Galley and Bookouture, thank you!

Generally, enough hints are dropped that I can quickly figure things out without much effort. The cover calls the twist breathtaking and there is no more fitting description to be found. I had already snagged this one from Netgalley when I read Payton\u2019s compelling review, but man did she make me want to read this even more! She assured me that I would love it and boy was she ever right. So thanks Payton for the fantastic recommendation.This is told from two perspectives, that of Olivia, a young mother who recently lost her husband, David and David\u2019s mother, Ivy. There are references made to The Tragedy, which obviously refers to David\u2019s death, but the details aren\u2019t revealed until the very end. Olivia\u2019s story is mostly told from the present though she reflects back on her marriage often, especially when she\u2019s meeting with her grief counselor. Ivy\u2019s story is told starting when David is born and leads all the way up until his death. It\u2019s clear early on that David and Olivia\u2019s marriage is full of dark secrets and that Ivy\u2019s relationship with her son is\u2026.odd to say the least.Olivia is a broken woman trying to pick up the pieces of her life after David\u2019s death. She\u2019s struggling to survive and the only thing that\u2019s keeping her going is her baby daughter, Zoe. This may be a minor spoiler, but I don\u2019t think it is as it\u2019s revealed straight away, but David abused poor Olivia. Not only was he physically abusive, he was so manipulative it chilled my blood. It was so subtle that even I had to think about it at times and say, did he really just say/do that?! I hated Ivy. HATED her. She has an unhealthy obsession with her son and refuses to believe that he could ever do any wrong. Like ever. Even as a young boy she convinced herself that everything was always someone else\u2019s fault besides David\u2019s and that he was literally perfect. She brings delusional to a whole new level and her lack of awareness made me sick. Even when she had small moments of doubt regarding David\u2019s abhorrent behavior, she was quick to brush it off and blame it on someone else.The character development, especially with Olivia, was phenomenal here. She starts off as a wounded and broken woman, but soon begins to take back her life and make a plan to at least try and be happy. I loved watching her have small victories and was mentally rooting her on the entire way. As I mentioned earlier, the twist was unexpected and shocking, but it also shattered my heart into a million pieces and made me cry like a baby. I experienced such a wide range of emotions while reading this one. I was angry, empathetic, sad, disgusted and at times even happy. This was clearly an emotional read and one that will stay with me for awhile."}, {"userName": "sue", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7377874-sue", "userReview": "This has zoomed right into my top 20 fabulous rememberable outstanding choices of 2016I have enjoyed every single book this author has written.

That\u2019s what these two women, Olivia and Ivy, struggle with throughout the whole book. Ironically, they have built their lives around the same man\u2013David. But they\u2019ve built their lives around him in two different ways. The story is told from two different perspectives, one a mother and one a wife. One can see absolutely no faults in David and one gets to see the ugly side of him way too frequently.One thing this book made me realize was that there\u2019s a very, very thin line between jealousy and protectiveness, but also protectiveness and possessiveness. Abuse and manipulation is not an overnight thing, but a gradual change in behavior that leaves you wondering how exactly did I get here and why have I let it get this far. This book was definitely an eye opener for me.It\u2019s ironic that Ivy\u2019s situation and choices as a teenager are very similar to the situation Olivia faces after college and yet Ivy doesn\u2019t really sympathize with Olivia. Even though Ivy knows that she settled for a life with her husband (and son) and refers to her life as a prison. How could she want that for another woman in the same predicament. Even though she really doesn\u2019t because she\u2019s never been supportive of David and Olivia\u2019s relationship and is constantly praying for their downfall. Once Ivy realized that Olivia was a permanent fixture in David\u2019s life, she made it very well known that she was on her son\u2019s side no matter what.Ivy isn\u2019t exactly an enabler but I think she knows deep down what her son is capable of and she writes it off and makes excuses for him. Ivy and Wyatt, David\u2019s parents, learn the hardest lesson imaginable\u2013turning a blind eye can prove to be fatal.The Tradegy, as it is referred to by Olivia, is mentioned pretty much on the first page and you\u2019re left wondering exactly what happened and through the 317 pages of the book, very slowly bits and pieces of the events that took place that day are revealed. The big reveal of The Tragedy was not even remotely close to what I was expecting. I would have never guessed that. It\u2019s so much worse than I could\u2019ve ever imagined. I was seriously blind-sided by the reveal, but it just added to the depth of the story.I don\u2019t know the words to express how incredibly brave Olivia is to rebuild her life and take back everything that was taken away from her. It\u2019s amazing to watch her transformation throughout the book. She definitely proves just how strong of a woman she truly is, regardless of what her past looks like. Olivia sets out a plan to get her life on track and she accomplishes it rather quickly, with a few setbacks.But when Olivia finally gets that puppy she\u2019s always wanted that is the true representation of just how far she has come. That scene seriously made my heart melt and the biggest grin came across my face. That puppy represents so much and it was the happiest moment of the book (almost).Ellen is seriously a godsend, in more ways that I can explain. She plays a pretty significant role in helping Olivia find her way again, even though it doesn\u2019t seem like it.The bomb dropped at the end is heartbreaking and goes hand in hand with The Tragedy. It took me a minute to really process what had occurred. The pink teddy bear is all I can tell you about The Tragedy. Please, please preorder and read this book. The light it sheds on so many aspects is truly amazing. Thank the book Gods above and mostly Kelly Rimmer for that Epilogue it was everything I needed and more! It provided the exact amount of closure that I needed. My goodness this was an amazing book that I almost can\u2019t form words!Kelly Rimmer is officially a must read author of mine and if she\u2019s not one of yours\u2026 Well she should be!"}, {"userName": "TamElaine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7555624-tamelaine", "userReview": "This is, I believe, written for an adult audience, but I'm going to go ahead and suggest that every mid-late teen, and every new adult interested in having an intimate relationship should read this book. It expertly addresses signs of abuse, how people who see themselves as smarter than to be abused, can not only be abused, but stick around for more. I say the word 'expertly' and I can attest to it - I have never quite related to a character quite the way I related to Olivia. Character development was fabulous ! Told in alternating points of view. I loved Olivia and hated Ivy, equally, but found them both fascinating - quite a study of perspectives. I love books like this...the only frustration I felt between going between characters was near the end of the book, when believe it or not, I wanted to continue with Ivy just a little bit longer.There was a twist in this book I never saw coming ! (Nope, not going to breathe a word to even hint at what it might be) - I will say I questioned a couple of things that might have indicated a twist was coming, but, still, I never saw it - it hit me suddenly.I was reading this last half of this book at a cafe with a tea in my hand - the tears came and I picked up and moved to the car - but unwilling to put the book down, I sat in the car to finish reading, the snow falling outside, me shivering, and I read right to the end. I drove home, my heart and my head aching. What a fabulous book. 5 ++ stars ! I'm reading this in November - I thought I had my top ten books of the year already chosen - I wasn't expecting another to pop up and be as good as the ten I had already shelved - so I guess this book is either knocking one of them out, or squeezing itself in !Thank you so much to NetGalley, Bookouture, and Kelly Rimmer, for the opportunity and honour to read and provide an honest review of A Mother's Confession."}, {"userName": "Paul Lockman", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53495766-paul-lockman", "userReview": "Kelly Rimmer has created a very powerful and moving story about domestic violence and abuse. Told alternately from the perspective of the victim Olivia and her mother-in-law Ivy, the book takes you on an emotional roller coaster and I found myself experiencing both empathy and sadness for what Olivia was going through and absolute outrage and contempt for her husband David for inflicting the pain and misery. There was also Ivy his mum (and Wyatt the father for that matter) turning a blind eye to what was happening which was unforgivable. How could Ivy\u2019s wonderful, precious David who she raised to be a decent person be an abusive husband, it\u2019s surely all Olivia\u2019s fault for provoking him! I got through this pretty quickly, a real page-turner that I found quite gripping. It\u2019s obvious that Kelly Rimmer has thoroughly researched domestic violence and full credit to her for bringing it to life in such a believable manner. I liked the way Olivia and David were both tertiary educated which helps dispel the myth that domestic violence only happens to uneducated people and I thought it was clever the way we get subtle hints from Ivy when reflecting on David\u2019s upbringing that there might be a nasty side to his personality.I recommend this book, if you\u2019re thinking you may not be able to stomach the violence, don\u2019t worry it isn\u2019t really described in graphic detail. The only negative comment I have is that the Epilogue, just two or three pages set two years after the tragic event, was in my view completely unnecessary."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1632609-anna", "userReview": "I've tried and tried to write a review for this, but whatever I attempt is pitiful; now matter how many words I write or how much feeling I try to convey, I can never do this book justice.

This was a book that in turn chilled me to the bone, whilst the brilliant device of a mother telling the tale of her little boy\u2019s birth onwards whilst his wife looks back on the life she shared with him as a man, had me absolutely hooked.We know straight off that there has been a tragedy. David is dead, his wife Olivia is struggling with her grief, her daughter Zoe the only daily contact she has with the world outside her front door. She is too paralysed to talk to her former colleague who delivers a daily monologue through the front door to her, although she keeps her appointments with her grief-counsellor, the contents of these are delivered to the reader with a force that at times took my breath away.David and Olivia were one of life\u2019s fortunate couples, they were well-off, professionals living in a beautiful house, close by to his mother which was handy for babysitting, but the tragedy of David\u2019s death has blown apart the careful construction of the perfect couple, the secrets can no longer be contained.Ivy is mourning the loss of her son by remembering key episodes of his life from his birth through to the present day. Ivy is a mother who pushed her child to the fore, a woman who lived her life through her son\u2019s achievements and as a result is lost, and perhaps unable to face up to what has happened.Set in Australia the small town setting is an inspired device to allow us to experience the different viewpoints of the locals, particularly as David\u2019s father owns the local grocery store. Olivia, and perhaps Ivy, have their versions of David challenged by those who only know part of their tale. We the readers are the fortunate ones because through both women we get to see the truth.The depth of characterisation and in particular the development of Olivia\u2019s as she moves from the first numbing days of grief to one where she begins to contemplate returning to work was superb. There was not one single moment when I disbelieved her actions, her words or thoughts. I was willing her along her difficult journey to an ending which simply had me stunned.Ivy is a different sort of mother, one who holds some outdated and therefore seemingly outlandish views, a difficult woman to like especially when her actions have caused Olivia so much pain, but, controversially she has her reasons and so I still had a smidgen of sympathy for this blinkered woman, not a lot, but I felt that as the author has given us a little of her background, it would almost be rude to dismiss her as a total witch.This book had me completely riveted, I did not want to part with it as I needed to know what was going to happen. The author pulled me in from the off, and each bit of information added to the rising feeling of dread in this book where it was obvious something terrible was going to be revealed, but quite what wasn\u2019t apparent until it was upon me.If you like books that let you run the gamut of emotions, a book that is pitched at just the right pace so that you are not fighting against the feeling that the author is withholding information as a ploy to fill the book, don\u2019t dismiss this book. The cover doesn\u2019t do justice to the power of the words inside A Mother\u2019s Confession."}, {"userName": "Joanne Robertson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25524955-joanne-robertson", "userReview": "Very rarely do I find a book that makes me howl like a baby but A Mothers Confession not only made me cry, I actually had to go into another room as I was sobbing so much I didn't want my family to see! Honestly, I feel as though someone has ripped my heart out of my chest, shredded it into a million pieces and then stuffed it back in again expecting it to work as normal....not happening!!!! This book has shot straight into my top 10 books of the year and I want EVERYONE to read it NOW!I actually didn't read any reviews of this book before I read it and personally, I would advise other potential readers to do the same. I think you will have a much deeper reaction to the storyline if you don't. Which means most of you should have stopped reading now but if you are still here then I can tell you that I actually hadn't thought this was my type of book from the blurb. But then I started to see the massive reactions people had after reading it and as I have a terrible fear of missing out I decided to downloaded a sample. Well, I read the first few pages then bought the rest of the book immediately as it had already started to give me goosebumps.This is a book told by the two women in the life of David Gillespie, his wife Olivia and his mother Ivy. But these women both seem to know and love a very different David. As a mother you always want to believe the best of your child and you will love and try to protect them till the day you die. But Ivy took her role as a mother to a much more extreme version of that, bordering on a rather unhealthy obsession. I wanted to understand her and bond with her as a fellow parent but it just didn't happen-I despised her. Olivia I loved from the moment that she appeared on the page, a totally different mother to baby Zoe but still putting her child first, especially since The Tragedy. And both women now have to deal with the aftermath of that tragedy but in very different ways.This has been one of the most emotional, heartbreaking and difficult to read books for me. I struggled to control my emotions at times, and let me tell you, they all came out! Anger and disgust jostled for position with sadness and fear but all overcome by a feeling of pure helplessness for the way this one man affected so many lives.As soon as I finished this book (well, after I finished crying into a whole packet of tissues) I went straight onto Amazon to buy this authors other books. They will have a lot to live up to compared to this one but I adored her storytelling skills so much I just have to have another hit! One of the most powerful books I have read this year. It was just BRILLIANT from beginning to end."}, {"userName": "Louise Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42343152-louise-wilson", "userReview": "The story is narrated bi Olivia & Ivy in alternating chapters.

One was his wife who wanted nothing more than to love and be loved. The other was his mother. She was unhappy in her own marriage and made her son the only reason to go on living.When David kills himself, these two women grieved in different ways. This story is told in alternating chapters from these women.Olivia is the wife. She loved David until his dark side started showing. He was abusive and physically battered his wife. Somehow it was always her fault. And she felt shame. So she told no one the hell she was going through. Ivy is the mother. She spent her life controlling every aspect of her son's life. No one was ever going to be good enough for him. She told him time after time he should not let any woman control him ... he deserved better. She also knew of his dark side and did nothing .. except tell her son she deserved it.Both women keep David's dark side secret. For Olivia, it was shame and love for her infant daughter. For Ivy it was to protect her son's reputation.I read this book in one sitting.. actually not moving once I started. It drew me in and kept me captivated, although it was like peeking in someone's windows without permission. My emotions were all over the place. I cheered for the wife who was so determined to go on and be a good mother to her daughter. I watched her fight her own fears, day by day, one after the other. I hated the mother ... how could she see what was happening and do nothing except blame the wife?This is such an exceptionally well written story of love, hate, loss, and a mother's love. One of the best I've read this year. The author tells the story of domestic violence with a steady hand, leaving more to the imagination than spelled out in graphic scenes. There are a few twists and turns, and the ending will astound the reader. Highly recommended.Many, many thanks to the author / Bookouture / Netgalley who provided a digital copy.

Written in a similar vain as Diane Chamberlain or Jodi Picoult, Rimmer tells a heartbreaking story of love, loss and grief, told from alternating viewpoints of Wyn & Ivy.The story had me hooked from the very first chapter and one that I didn't want to put down. The plot quickly unfolds and makes you really start to think about \"nature vs. nurture\". Is it possible that domestic abusers can be raised to be such, or is it part of their genetic make up? Or is it both? Rimmer certainly makes you feel and you can't help but have strong feelings for our main characters. I would highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Betty", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3298217-betty", "userReview": "Bookouture puts out yet another fantastic read with Kelly Rimmer\u2019s A Mother\u2019s Confession. I know the old adage about never judging a book by its cover, but I\u2019m sucker for gorgeous book covers, and this one definitely drew me in. Once I read the mini-blurb on the cover, I knew I had to read this book.The story is told from the perspectives of two mothers\u2014Olivia and Ivy Gillespie\u2014in alternating chapters. In Olivia\u2019s part of the story, we learn details about her courtship and marriage to David, and the birth of daughter Zoe. With Ivy, we learn about her relationship with husband, Wyatt, and how David was raised from birth to manhood.Ivy\u2019s whole world revolved around David. She was an extremely protective mother who thought David could do no wrong. When teenaged David becomes more interested in girls than spending time with his mother, Ivy is jealous and feels no girl David is infatuated with is good enough for her son; she only has to find a way to make him see that for himself. When David goes to college and begins dating Olivia, however, she\u2019s unsuccessful in her endeavors, and gains a daughter-in-law she didn\u2019t want\u2014and whom she will ultimately blame for the death of her beloved son.Olivia wanted more than being just a wife and mother; she wanted a career, as well. The life she envisioned for herself changed once her relationship with David turned serious. By the time they married, she was estranged from her family, and she rarely went anywhere without David at her side. On the surface, Olivia seemed to have it all\u2026 a handsome, respected, successful husband, a luxurious home, a beautiful baby girl, and a successful career of her own\u2026 but appearances can be deceiving. When David dies, Olivia is shattered and struggles to put the pieces of her life back together again.I simply could not put this book down. For a day and a half, I lived in Olivia\u2019s world, compelled to keep turning the page. That \u201cbreathtaking twist\u201d mentioned on the cover? It definitely lived up to its promise\u2026 and that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about that.Kelly Rimmer, you\u2019ve earned a spot on my Author Radar with this brilliantly written novel. I can\u2019t wait to read more of your work.To everyone reading this review: If you haven\u2019t read this author yet, I strongly recommend you do so\u2026 and suggest you begin with this riveting novel.I received an advance review copy of this book courtesy of the publisher via Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Martie Nees Record", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4793025-martie-nees-record", "userReview": "You know that when there is a contemporary novel about a perfect married couple with their beautiful, perfect baby, sooner or later you will learn that something is amiss. The dark secret in this marriage was that the husband was a wife abuser. Still, the wife had a complete mental breakdown after her husband commits suicide. This is a character driven novel that is narrated by the young mother and her mother-in-law. The chapters alternate between them. The mother-in-law raised her son to believe that he could do no wrong no matter how much wrong he did. At a very young age, he showed signs of serious anger issues, but his mother was determined to believe that he was and would always be perfect. All of her own identity went into who her son was. They had an extremely toxic relationship, to the point of being able to say that this is a novel about two women loving the same man.The author, Kelly Rimmer, answers the unsympathetic question of \u201cwhy don\u2019t they just leave?\u201d As shown in the end-notes, Rimmer did her homework. On this subject, she wrote similar to Anna Quindlen\u2019s novel \u201cBlack and Blue.\u201d Though Quindlen, as a Pulitzer Prize journalist winner wrote about domestic violence in a less sentimental manner than Rimmer. Quindlen\u2019s style of writing may not appeal to those who enjoy Rimmer, whose novel is a soul searching book with much emotional appeal.The interactions between the two mothers were upsetting as well as fascinating to read. Although, I found fault that the mother-in-law was written as a one- dimensional character. She was almost too easy to hate, which I did. My main issue with this book is that is it is marketed as having a breathtaking twist. The supposedly blindsiding incident was obvious very early on in the story. I actually thought the author was not hiding it. So I kept waiting for the twist right up until the last page. This does not make the story any less of a heart-wrenching read, but it did spoil it for me. I am having a hard time understanding how other Advanced Copy Reviewers (ACR) missed it. I probably will not read Rimmer again, but if you are in the mood for a real tear-jerker, this one is for you.Find all my reviews at https://books6259.wordpress.com/"}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29279709-karen", "userReview": "A Mother's Confession by Kelly RimmerThis book was about domestic violence between Olivia and her husband David Gillespie. It is also about the deep unyielding love between two women and their only child. David's mother's name is Ivy and we hear from both points of view of Olivia and Ivy in alternating chapters. Both love their children more than anything else in the world. Ivy tells of her only child David's childhood from when he was a little boy until he has met and married Olivia as an adult. Olivia and David meet in college and have a long ten year romance before they get married and have an only child named Zoe, who is just a baby. Olivia tells her story to a psychologist about her life with David. Olivia keeps referring to something that happens in the book as \"The Tragedy.\" Something happens early on as Olivia tells her story. She used to work in a animal veterinary practice. Ivy is so attached to her son David that she sees everything he does through rose colored glasses. All throughout David's life his mother thinks that anything he does wrong is because it is somebody else's fault.There is a lot of ground that gets covered as both Olivia and Ivy tell their stories as they see things from their individual perceptions. To say any more would give away spoilers. The writing is simple and easy to understand. The sentences have a natural flow. Olivia and Ivy are both character studies. This book explores the insidiousness of domestic violence. How it can start out looking like the abuser is just overly caring or over protective, when it is really about control. It explores how the victim gets stuck in a cycle once it starts. It is a well written case study making the storytelling very realistic.Thank you to Net Galley, the talented Kelly Rimmer and the Publisher for providing me with my digital copy for a fair and honest review."}, {"userName": "Donna ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38350713-donna", "userReview": "A Big Thanks to Netgalley, the publisher Bookouture, and the author Kelly Rimmer for the opportunity to read this extraordinary book in return for a fair and honest review.WOW, where do I begin?? It has been a long time since I've read a book that had me at a loss for words. I finished this incredibly well-written book well over a week ago and there hasn't been a day since then that I have not thought about some part of this story...What an emotional roller coaster ride this book has been for me !! Simply Amazing !!!Let's talk about emotions first. Anger, sadness, happiness, disgust, and total surprise are but a few of the emotions I felt reading this novel. Kelly Rimmer is an extremely talented writer to be able to elicit so many feelings within one story. \"A Mother's Confession\" is the first book I've read by Ms. Rimmer but it most definitely will not be the last !The story is written in two totally different female points of view. Ivy, the over protective mother of David and Olivia (Livvy), the wife of David. Ivy absolutely believes her son can do NO wrong, she makes excuses for him at every turn and will defend him no matter what. Olivia tells her story as it happens, the way it happened truthfully. My feelings of empathy and compassion for Olivia were as strong as my feelings of anger and disdain for Ivy. These conflicting emotions toward the narrator's just add to the overall intensity of the story!This book grabbed hold of me within the first few pages and never let go until the end. \"A Mother's Confession\" is that type of book that will stay with you for a long long time. It is an extremely impressive, well-written, heartbreaking story. All I can say in conclusion is...Read this Book !!Kudos to Kelly Rimmer on this extraordinary novel !!"}, {"userName": "Laurel", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20892845-laurel", "userReview": "I was given an ARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest and independent review. A very intense novel told with great empathy. The story is narrated through two characters Olivia and her mother in law, Ivy in alternating chapters, which I really liked. The characters are extremely well thought out and interesting. This is a powerful book which made me feel a diverse range of emotions - anger, frustration, sympathy and sadness. I was quite shocked at the depth of emotion I felt with Ivy's inability to openly see her son as he truly was, and that the love she had for him blinded her to who he truly was, and her manipulation of various circumstances to ease her conscience.

Sometimes I actually miss him, but then in the very next breath I find that I hate him so much that I hope there is a hell, just so that he can be suffering like he left me here to suffer.\u201d\nCompletely incredible and heartbreaking. If I could find words to describe A Mother\u2019s Confession, then those are what I would choose.A Mother\u2019s Confession is told in dual points of view and by that I mean very, very different points of view. We learn of an event they call \u2018The Tragedy\u2019 very early on in the story and as told in the blurb it ends up being Davids death. So we have Olivia, a widowed mother and then we have Ivy, Davids mother. We know about the tragedy from Olivia\u2019s perspective since she is narrating the story from mostly the present. Ivy though, mostly talks about from when David was born and gives us a view of what their life and what David and Olivia\u2019s life were like together. Soon secrets start spilling out and you feel your heart breaking a little more with each turn of a page.Olivia was probably the strongest, most brave character I have ever met in a book. She was also a very broken woman, though. Surviving only by her young daughter Zoe, you can\u2019t help but clutch your heart as you read her part of the story. She was amazing to me. Her story, her life, her pain, all of it was written so well. She fell in love with an abusive, manipulating man. He would do it so calmly at times that it made the hairs on my arms stand right up. When Olivia was finally healing though, and getting her life back together, it was seriously breathtaking and I would sigh with relief.Ivy Gillespie was insane. I mean just writing about her character has my blood boiling. I hated her. She was COMPLETELY obsessed with her son David and I don\u2019t mean it in a healthy way. I mean it in a possessive and just creepy way. The things she would let David get away with made me so sick to my stomach. Ivy was an enabler all the way when it came to David and I couldn\u2019t believe the things she would say to encourage him. I can\u2019t stand her and things would have been so much different if she would have opened her mouth the RIGHT way.The characters in this book were spot on though. As much as I didn\u2019t like Ivy, I think her character was needed to give this book the kind of emotion you felt. I loved so many other\u2019s though, number one being Olivia. I also loved her parents and her sister, I loved Ingrid, Ellen and I completely adored Sebastian. The author did such a wonderful job just making you feel so much. This book is very emotional to say the least.Towards the end you get a completely unexpected twist. I just had this gut feeling about it as I was inching closer to the last chapters. Even though I had a feeling, the reality still broke me to pieces. The raw pain and the realness you feel while reading this is crazy. I felt so many things while reading it and I don\u2019t think I will ever forget it.
