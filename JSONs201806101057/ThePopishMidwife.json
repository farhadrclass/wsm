Back then, you ran the risk of a severe beating, or being murdered, just for following a different religion. Sadly, in certain parts of our world, such extreme intolerance is still pervasive.Cellier\u2019s story is beautifully-written; her indefatigable heroism and the dialogue of the period are perfectly realised by the author.And there are sparkling moments of humour too: Elizabeth is granted an audience with the King and warns him of the assassination plot. His Majesty, who doesn\u2019t go a day without hearing of some plot or another, finds the whole thing hilarious. \u201cI am verily the most murdered King of England!\u201d He jests.Overall, despite some grammatical inconsistencies, and a frugality of character imagery (I have no idea what Elizabeth Cellier looks like), this was a splendid read that had me rooting for the Popish Midwife from start to finish. A praiseworthy d\u00e9but by English author, Annelisa Christensen."}, {"userName": "Vicki", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8085705-vicki", "userReview": "Such a beautifully written historical tale of courage, love, and struggle. I was caught up in the prose. the beauty of the language spoke to me and completely brought me back in history. It was a rarity to see such detail in a book written in the present. The words that Ms. Christensen used touched me in such a profound way. I loved every aspect of this story. You could project yourself back in time with her scenes. The courtroom scenes were dynamic and riveting. This is one of those books that you are just thankful to have found and enjoyed. It is a must read for anyone that loves a good historical tale."}, {"userName": "Julia Grantham", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36338481-julia-grantham", "userReview": "Author Christensen has written a beautiful and poignant true-life story of Elizabeth Cellier, a remarkable woman and midwife, who lived in 17th century London. Cellier was a feisty and courageous woman, who, despite great risk to herself and her family, stayed true to her Catholic faith and her belief in justice. She fought against all odds to expose the truth of deplorable prison conditions and lies against Catholics, believed to be plotting against the King. \tI was immediately pulled into 17th century England, the culture, politics, and everyday life in an unstable time of religious prejudice, fear, and lack of education. With Christensen\u2019s vivid writing I could picture and feel every scene, from the elegance of the royal palace to the filth and brutality of Newgate Prison, to what it would feel like to lose your freedom in an unjust political system.\tCellier was charitable to those who suffered unjustly, often simply for being debtors or practicing the Catholic faith in a time of Protestant dominance. Author Christensen wrote that Cellier was \u201ctrue to herself and to truth itself.\u201d Indeed, her faith in God and truth was constant to the point of being willing to die for it.\tAs a lawyer and litigator, I loved the drama of the two trial scenes when Cellier stood accused, first for treason, then for libel. Brilliant and clever, Cellier learned the laws and courtroom procedures, pulled together required proofs, then used the justice system with spunk and wit against witnesses and lawyers alike. With her quick assessment of jurors, witnesses, and the mood of the \u201cBeast\u201d (the ignorant, blood thirsty mob) she modified her behavior and defense accordingly.\tCellier deplored the poor training of midwives and lack of education for all women. Seeing the brutal effects of ignorance, she chose to do something, not just through charity, but with a grand design for a self-funded midwifery school and home for poor children. She was a woman of strong belief and action, a powerful combination. \tThere were wonderful descriptions of Cellier\u2019s torn loyalties, to her conscience and moral duty even when it conflicted with her beloved husband Pierre\u2019s wishes, her love of family and her own freedom. The domestic scenes with Pierre and then with her young children were touching, evocative, and among the best in the book. \tAuthor Christensen didn\u2019t fail to show Cellier\u2019s minor flaws, especially when she fell prey to a villainous, betraying rogue, enjoying his youthful good looks and attention to her. Yet this was always balanced with her strong love and respect for her Pierre, her bastion of honor and strength. Pierre, in turn, relied on his beloved Lizzie, needing her love and presence as much as the air he breathed. A beautiful, touching love story!\tAuthor Christensen pulled together voluminous research about Cellier and the era, and has done so brilliantly with a story that is poignant and universal in appeal. I highly recommend this book for the beautiful writing and compelling story, and I look forward to more from Author Christensen."}, {"userName": "Sheri McInnis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43924679-sheri-mcinnis", "userReview": "The Popish Midwife is that rare treat: a true story with all the drama of inspired fiction. The book starts with a quick preface that brings the reader up-to-date on 17th Century London. The Great Fire of 1666, disease, religious upheaval and more. These are dangerous times for anyone \u2013 let alone a Catholic (or \u2018popish\u2019) midwife like our heroine, Elizabeth Cellier. The story moves into the first-person as we follow Elizabeth on her way to deliver a baby. As I read, I felt the world transform around me, as if I was suddenly being led down the streets of London myself. The description is fantastic. But I also think it\u2019s because the author has the ability to write prose that feels true to the era, without being stiff or overly formal. Another bonus is that Christensen doesn\u2019t seem to lose sight of the fact that this is a novel \u2013 not a textbook. It\u2019s an entertaining story with authentic dialogue, visceral descriptions and lots of action, especially since Elizabeth was charged with treason.The book is reminiscent of Philippa Gregory\u2019s work: a first-person historical narrative with a strong female voice. But where Gregory sometimes treads over territory that feels familiar to us (in part because of her own well-deserved success!), The Popish Midwife feels so fresh and original. Intelligent, entertaining and wonderfully written, this is the debut of a first-rate historical novelist. I sincerely hope it\u2019s not the last we hear from Ms. Christensen!"}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4499021-sharon", "userReview": "We first encounter Elizabeth as she takes over from, who can only be described as a butcher midwife attending to an unfortunate woman in labour. This startling scene is a shocking and horrifying lead into the brutal, frightening times of 17th Century England. Being a midwife wasn't the respectable vocation it is today. The only qualification required was to have been present at other births, and then, not all midwives had the best interests of their charges at heart. They often had poor regard for hygiene standards and were more intent on receiving payment for their services in order to purchase their next drink. A trusted experienced midwife could make a decent living from midwifery with the written, or 'word of mouth', testimonials from women who had been birthed by them. These midwives would be given access to places many other women would not, as with Elizabeth Cellier and her prison visits to give alms to the suffering, or gain entrance to gentle women's residences to assist in their birthing hours. All midwives were however, open to abuse from misogynistic men, and to accusations of being whores and witches.Elizabeth Cellier is a woman with an unwavering confidence and belief in herself to do what she believes is right and will defend those who have been unjustly accused. She is also a midwife, a Catholic, and married to a Frenchman, all of which mark her out as a target for ill wishers seeking potential benefit from her downfall in such superstitious, and political conspiratorial, religious times of upheaval. Highly intelligent and articulate, after witnessing a prejudiced courtroom hearing, she uses the experience of the proceedings to her advantage when she is herself charged with treason.Told in first person narrative with authentic dialogue, Christensen has written a fascinating, brutally honest, above all entertaining debut novel. With characters so vividly drawn, and scenes rich in atmospheric historical detail, I could almost imagine being there smelling the fear, and decaying bodies of the poor sufferers, I wanted so much to reach out to the unfortunates from within Elizabeth's imagined body. Christensen came upon the 'real life' Elizabeth Cellier\u2019s story by accident when she won some pages recording Elizabeth's trial in an auction. She felt that her story should be told and 'The Popish Midwife' is her story, and one which I highly recommend. She is currently working on an historical novel about Marie Desormeaux, another 17th Century midwife, who murdered her husband, cut him up and distributed the body parts around London. Definitely looking forward to another entertaining and gruesome, oh and educational tale from this author.Disclaimer: I am extremely grateful to have been given an opportunity to receive an advanced digital copy of 'The Popish Midwife' by the author to review as part of HF Virtual Book Tours."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43757589-jennifer", "userReview": "Based upon the life of a real woman, The Popish Midwife is a compelling narrative of intrigue and the quest for the truth. I feel as if I've walked the streets of 17th century London during this tale and absorbed every aspect of the era, especially the odours. The phrase 'no good deed goes unpunished' could be used to describe Mrs. Cellier's exploits and fortunes. Her resolve and moral compass is a wonderful example of what the human race could be.

If you have ever thought that history is boring, take another look at it through the eyes of this talented writer. Christensen\u2019s entertaining, enlightening and horrendous account of life in seventeenth Century England, and in particular in the life of Elizabeth Cellier, will definitely change your mind.As Christensen introduces the reader to the life of this unforgettable crusader, the reader is eloquently transported to seventeenth century England where just existing is a challenge. She tells of horrific living conditions where there is no sanitation; all human waste and garbage is thrown into the streets and is carried away with the rain and on the hems of the women\u2019s dresses. The filth and odors bring forth rats that carry disease. The bubonic plague and a massive fire assaults London bringing death and strife. It is also a time of great political and religious upheaval where innocents are thrown in jail for their beliefs. The reader quickly recognizes and becomes privy to the unbelievable hardships that English families faced in the 1600s. Those of you that know the story of Elizabeth Cellier from your English history will delight in the detail that Ms. Christensen creatively expounds on in her story. Elizabeth \u201cLizzie\u201d Cellier was a brave and courageous woman. She was truly one of substance and importance, and one who acted boldly when faced with the mistreatment of Catholics. She was also a sensitive and caring midwife who desperately felt that it was her duty to help her fellow countrymen/women while sometimes jeopardizing her own life and family. The comprehensive research that Ms. Christensen obviously completed in order to write \u2018The Popish Midwife\u2019 is mind-boggling. Ms. Christensen digs deep into historical facts to weave a truly captivating story for her readers. This moving tale is not only a love story set in the seventeenth century between an English woman and her French husband. More importantly, it is a love story between a woman and her neighbors, and a woman and the ill treated. It is a tale of a caring woman whose heart ached for the injustices that abounded around her. This book is a timeless tale of endurance and hope.I highly recommend this well-written book to history lovers as well as to readers looking for an engaging story of high treason, courage and love. \u201cThe Popish Midwife\u201d, both the woman and the book, left this reader in awe of the gutsy and spirited Ms. Cellier, as well as of its author, Annelisa Christensen."}, {"userName": "Simon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57592038-simon", "userReview": "I had thought I was well versed in English History, it was all about wives, wars, and monarchs needing a male heir. Right? Turns out I was wrong. Mine were just superficial sound bytes, learned at school. The Popish Midwife offered me a view of everyday life in the seventeenth century, a window into the knife-edge that was existence. A real sense of the persecution that came with the flip-flopping of a Nation between religions.It is a story told through the eyes of the tenacious Elizabeth Cellier, in what was a truly terrifying time to be alive, a time in which persecution swung like a pendulum over one poor group or another, and a deep hatred and resentment festered amongst the population. The tale of Elizabeth Cellier is indeed one that needs to be told, I can understand why she appealed so much to the author. Her strength of character and resolve seems to have been truly remarkable, her intelligence, vision and sense of justice way ahead of her time. It is to people like Cellier that we owe our thanks for those basic rights that we take for granted in the modern world. Justice. Liberty. Equality. This is a well written, incredibly well researched novel that will pique any reader's interest, and Christensen certainly has an ability to bring the story to life. She was able to place me right back into those filthy London streets, and I could feel the stress building in me at some of the situations with which Cellier was confronted.The only problem for me was one that I assume is common with historical fiction, that sometimes the facts of what happened can be extremely frustrating. On occasion, Cellier made decisions which I felt exacerbated her problems and took the story somewhere that I didn't want it to go, a problem that I wouldn't normally come across in fiction.Having said that, this is a very good read, and I would certainly recommend others read this book."}, {"userName": "Mercedes Rochelle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4548783-mercedes-rochelle", "userReview": "After the restoration of King Charles II, it was very uncomfortable to be a Catholic in England. This is the environment we are immersed in while following the story of midwife Elizabeth Cellier. She finds herself unable to stomach the abysmal conditions of political prisoners and decides to do something about it. She is already outside of polite society because of her profession, looked askance at by one and all\u2014even those she tended, apparently. Her faith exposes her to sanctioned abuse. But once she launches herself on a one-woman campaign to expose the corruption in the system, she is committed to a path that will lead her straight into the jaws of the monster.Honorable though her intentions are, Elizabeth\u2019s judgment seems a bit flawed. Her first mistake is to champion a starving wretch who appeals to her womanly instincts; she arranges his release and even gives him a place to live, though his actions are questionable at times. Throughout the book, Elizabeth does whatever she wants, paying little attention to the wishes of her long-suffering husband whose first concern is about her well-being, and secondly the safety of their children. But, apparently carried away by her righteous mission, she blithely goes on to accuse everyone in power of corruption and cruelty. There is no doubt that she will be arrested and prosecuted, yet she seemed surprised when it finally happened; I was surprised it took so long, and that her family escaped persecution. It was interesting to see the author explore the fine line between \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d and ignoring the needs of her family. Our real-life heroine lets nothing get in her way in an era when just being a woman was a significant hurdle. This novel does a wonderful job of revealing the everyday struggles of a time period we have little understanding of.

It's hard for me to say if she is a hero or a victim of her time, but she was anything but dull. Coupled with a very complex heroine is a very complex time period. Elizabeth faces many different obstacles, and Christensen doesn't hold back on the reality of the situation women-midwives- catholics faced during this time period.

Elizabeth Cellier is brave, says it like it is, a midwife, a true one for so many midwives are not trained and babies and mothers die The symbol of Elizabeth\u2019s calling is a red cape and her tools that she uses to bring babies into the world.The Catholics suffer terrible torture by the puritans as the puritans attempt to force them to admit to actions, which they did not do and anyone who is within a block of the torture chamber can hear the men screaming. Elizabeth, along with a few other Catholic women, regularly visit Newgate Prison to bring a little food and water to help sustain these prisoners. Elizabeth never gets to see them then, but if they are ever released, she tries to nurse them back to health, although they are terribly crippled as a result of such torture instruments.When she is a young woman, she is caught by some puritans and severely beaten so that some of her body never mended. Eventually, attempting to get the attention of the King and the people about these unfair and unjust conditions, writes a book about the situation, without the consent of the King. She is arrested and thrown into prison under the same conditions she had been attempting to alleviate, and although not tortured, suffers terribly from the cold, dampness, filth, lack of water and starvation. After about two years she is brought before the judges who find her guilty, continue her jail sentence and she is to be pilloried three times. The time in the jail under these conditions undermines her health and her body hurts all of the time.She has a husband and children whom she worries about and her husband Pierre earns just enough to feed the family and get by, but he is like a lifesaver and helps her to try to stay alive. Every time Elizabeth manages to improve her life, it is like her feet are kicked out from under her and she is struggling to survive and put up with her body pain.This is a story that is most depressing and yet at times the reader feels like \u201cyeah\u201d, she is on top again. From what the author says, most of this story is historically correct and we all know about the protestant-Catholic problems from the time of Henry VIII through his daughter, Queen Elizabeth. I recommend this book to anyone who seeks truth of the Middle Ages and likes to learn how it was. I was given a complimentary e-book for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Lisl", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27426645-lisl", "userReview": "There is a reality to my co-existence with seventeenth-century London: I\u2019m not all that well versed in it. The little information stuffed into my head is probably what most people already know, affairs such as Charles I\u2019s execution; rise of the Commonwealth and Protectorate; and return of Charles II, previously driven into exile following his father\u2019s death in 1649.Annelisa Christensen\u2019s The Popish Midwife is set against the backdrop of this era\u2019s heir: nearly twenty years into the Restoration and twelve following the Great Fire of 1666. Cromwell is long dead, but his vehement and divisive anti-Catholic bias endures, a lesson our popish protagonist learns after she is beaten in the streets by an entire thuggish family, solely for her religious beliefs.Inspired by papers the author purchased merely for the thrill of holding 300-year-old documents, and which turned out to be from the historical trial of Elizabeth Cellier, Christensen pieces together true events of this era, when Catholicism was suspect and one Titus Oates speaks of a plot perpetrated by Catholics to remove the Protestant king and replace him with his younger\u2014and Catholic\u2014brother. Power had been shifting back and forth between the two religions since before Elizabeth I, though anti-Catholic sentiment prevailed with the Gunpowder Plot on this day in 1605. This must have weighed heavily on Cellier\u2019s mind upon her arrest as party to the conspiracy.Before her 1680 trial, Elizabeth Cellier, a midwife devoted to the health and safety of others, fervently follows news and the welfare of those unjustly incarcerated\u2014often her co-religionionists. As a frequent visitor to Newgate Prison, Cellier dispenses assistance in the form of sustenance as well as emotional and monetary support. Here she comes into contact with Captain Willoughby, a debtor inmate who provides her information in aid of her petition to the king regarding abuse of prisoners. Her involvement in what we know today as the Popish Plot endangers her family as she battles injustice on top of religious bigotry.The novel opens with a strong and succinct preface providing background on the preceding years, then moves into Cellier\u2019s first-person account, where Christensen succeeds marvelously with Cellier\u2019s sketch of her individual and family history, and where that places her in society. The author\u2019s point of view choice allows readers to more intensely relate to the protagonist and her work, indeed why she does it. This increases the overall narrative\u2019s strength, providing a foundation for the midwife\u2019s reasoning as to why she ignores her beloved husband\u2019s pleas about the peril she places them all in.Christensen also has a way with dialogue as well as her prose, as her management of it surrounds readers with a real sense of the time. More modern than much of the historical fiction we tend to read, it nevertheless retains an aura of formality with its hierarchal speech patterns and conduct.Lady Powys was undertaking to arrange a marital alliance between her nephew and the daughter of her close acquaintance, Lord Peterborough. She designed to appeal to him to agree a meeting with me that I could introduce him to the Captain, with the further hope that Lord Peterborough would then in turn introduce us to the Duke of York. The beauty of this meeting was that, not only had Lord Peterborough served beneath the Duke with the war in the Netherlands, but he had also set up, and defeated objections to, the marriage between the Duke and his chosen wife, Mary of Modena. The Duke was accordingly indebted to him and was, as hoped, prepared to make allowances for our using him to reach his brother.In other instances, such as during and after the afore-mentioned assault, the author\u2019s atmospheric language immerses us within the ways of the time, not unlike the manner in which a word such as cobblestone might, even when characters engage in similar acts we still ordinarily perform or encounter, albeit with modified character. Falling into the grimy water (reminiscent of waste disposal discussed in her preface), the \u201ccomforting crackle of the fire,\u201d coins jangling into men\u2019s palms as payment for a kind service provided, and the \u201cclunking of the door latch\u201d into place all reach into Elizabeth\u2019s sensory experience of her time in a moment when she, like us, is removed from full participation of it.Perhaps more than any other characteristic is Christensen\u2019s ability to really touch an audience with this story of Elizabeth Cellier, fighting inequity as she endeavors to keep her family safe and intact. Her descriptions are vivid and jolting, and Cellier\u2019s honest self-reflections are portrayed in such a way that we feel her keen embarrassment paired with upright defense of self against mob rule. The novel\u2019s pacing\u2014not quite as fast as some\u2014not only places us in the moments, but also enables our ongoing feel of them as the characters might experience. Cellier isn\u2019t a braggart, not by a long shot, yet we see her through her own eyes and recognize her courageous stand against brutality, as well as her reminder that freedom to opine never existed to protect popular positions. This is also acted out in dramatic scenes in which Cellier\u2014Catholic, woman, married to a foreigner\u2014speaks up, bold and daring. She is not what today\u2019s feminists would envision, nor should she be, and Christensen stays true to the era.It bears repeating that The Popish Midwife immerses us in the time, an especially impressive feat for those of us who tend to wander through other eras or, as in my own case, aren\u2019t really as familiar with Charles II\u2019s London as we might be. As I traversed the pages, I felt myself wandering the rainy streets, the shadows pulling around me as I avoid waste and mud in the streets, feel the still re-awakening of the people from a succession of horrific events, this newness tainted by fear and suspicion that the torture of Protestants in Mediterranean countries might reach their own shores.The forbidding darkness of mood is periodically pierced by references to color, such as the bright red of Cellier\u2019s distinctive and identifying midwife\u2019s cape. Shown on the novel\u2019s cover, it stands in stark contrast to the dark shade of the floor, kitchen implements, even Cellier\u2019s clothes beneath it. There is a golden hue in the background, reminiscent of a light in darkness, though still in opposition to the vivid material of the cloak, which at one point Cellier loses, signaling both her fight against discrimination and the choices she must make as to how she will proceed: remain in the shadows or embrace her identity utilizing the internal as opposed to material?From the lead up to \u201c\u2019Tis a plot, Madam, of the direst sort[,]\u201d all the way through Cellier\u2019s battles and acceptance of what she has done and plans for her future, Christensen\u2019s lovely style of storytelling, as if Cellier is talking directly to us, captures the imagination and leads us through a tale of brutality and betrayal, individual and collective upheaval, treason and courage. To be able to reach deep into history and find one of the more obscure figures from it, as the author did on that auction day, and animate her in literary style, particularly for readers unfamiliar with the era, is no mean feat, and readers should hope Christensen never tires of the scrape, chaos and shuffle of the auction houses any time soon."}, {"userName": "Viga Boland", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19395877-viga-boland", "userReview": "It's a bold task to take on writing a 400 page plus book based on the life of an obscure English midwife who lived in the 1600s. But that is the challenge AnnaLisa Christensen gave herself with The Popish Midwife, after studying court transcripts about the trial and conviction of the courageous Elizabeth Cellier who dared to write a book disclosing the brutality and inhumane treatment of those imprisoned for even minor offences at Newgate Prison.The Popish Midwife takes place at the end of the puritanical, strict era of Oliver Cromwell when King Charles 11 was returned to the throne. While people celebrated the new freedom, the country was far from safe or healthy, especially for Catholics. As a Catholic, Elizabeth was ever exposed to danger as she went about her work of helping mothers give birth. She also spent much of her time taking food to prison inmates and as she did so, she saw and heard first hand so much of man's inhumanity to man. She felt compelled to bring these brutal practices to the attention of those she believed would care as much as she did. The reward for the efforts of this aging, unwell but brave woman, was incarceration in the very place she fought to expose: Newgate.Historical fiction buffs will love The Popish Midwife, but it is written in first person, as if it were a memoir. That, for me, makes what AnnaLisa Christensen has achieved in this book even more impressive: it has all the requirements of great historical fiction, including an adherence to the language of the 1600's, but it is touching and real the way a well-written memoir should be. The author spent years researching her story and her attention to detail and fact, the historical period, customs and dialects gives The Popish Midwife authenticity. But it is AnnaLisa Christensen's considerable writing talent that make this an absorbing, worthwhile read even for those, who like me, aren't fans of historical fiction, but who love a well-written story\u2026one that keeps us turning the pages and wondering what will happen next.

Annelisa Christensen has achieved a major coup in her telling of the incredibly brave, and vividly real, seventeenth century midwife, Elizabeth Cellier. To submerge yourself into The Popish Midwife is to experience life in London under Charles II: to feel the textures of society, smell the odors of a bustling city and hear the chatter of Cellier and those around her. Never have I read a book so absorbing that, without exaggeration, when I eventually looked up from reading, part of me struggled to discover I was still in the twenty first century. This is a beautifully narrated book with impeccably researched information that is accurate down to the smallest details. Christensen has accomplished a feat most history teachers the world over will envy. She has brought to life the human behind the name of a little known historical figure and introduced us to a real person we want to cheer on, care for and cry with. That is the greatest praise I can bestow on a writer."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35846220-lyn", "userReview": "Miss LynFormat: Kindle EditionI love good historical fiction and the true story of Elizabeth Cellier fulfilled my every expectation.

The author has obviously done a great deal of research on the seventeenth century in general and Elizabeth Cellier in particular. Not knowing anything about Mrs. Cellier, I can't say how true-to-history the story is. It certainly seems plausible, if remarkable.The story dragged in places for me, and some of it seemed repetitive. However, it kept me reading to the end to find out what happened.

What an incredible story it turned out to be! With skill and an exceptional depth of research, Annelisa Christensen has told the story of Elizabeth Cellier, Catholic upper class midwife at the time of Titas Oates, who was passionate about not only her profession, but about the plight of prisoners. The story is based on the true story and actual trial transcripts of Cellier and gives this brave woman a voice, a voice that still speaks to us talking about betrayal, persecution and treachery. Whilst reading the book, and still now, some time later, the skill of the author is so great and I so strongly related to Elizabeth that (like the author) I feel I could play her in a screen play with no coaching. The reader really feels a part of the action and of the time and can so easily empathise with Cellier's struggles and pains and fears. The Popish Midwife is Annelisa Christensen's debut published novel. She has shown she has a fresh and original voice in a genre of mediocrity. I look forward to reading more, lots more, from this masterful author."}, {"userName": "Lucy", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69754720-lucy", "userReview": "Excellent historical fiction.

Discriminated against, assumed to be \"disloyal\" to the Crown and viewed with suspicion because of their religion, Catholics of the day were imprisoned and tortured for that \"disloyalty,\" creating an environment of suspicion and prejudice much like we see against Muslims today. In that environment, Cellier is the compassionate and strong outsider who seeks to relieve the pain of those under oppression. During a relief visit to one of the King's prisons -- that prison depicted vividly and viscerally by Ms. Christensen -- Cellier is moved by the plight of those incarcerated and tortured and works to help one prisoner in particular. But her compassionate and caring nature leave her vulnerable to betrayal, placing her in the midst of \"The Meal-Tub Plot\" against the King, leaving her with only her wits, her intelligence, and the love of her family to save herself from the gallows at Tyburn.Vividly and beautfully written, the language of the day ringing throughout, \"The Popish Midwife\" will be an enthralling read for those who believe in equality and social justice. As historical fiction, it immerses you in the era; as a biography, it tells a great story, leaving the reader wondering how much more Elizabeth Cellier could have achieved had she been born a couple of centuries later. To Ms. Cellier for her courage, and to Ms. Christensen for introducing the modern world to Elizabeth Cellier, I can only say \"Bravo!\""}], "description": "In seventeenth-century London, thirteen years after the plague and twelve years after the Great Fire, the restoration of King Charles II has dulled the memory of Cromwell's puritan rule, yet fear and suspicion are rife.
