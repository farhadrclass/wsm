Not the past, not the future but the present! At some point in life each one of us experience one or more devastating incidents that change our lives forever (if not, then I guess you're lucky!). This Is Sarah will make you relive it. Yea, I know, that scared me as well, but at the end it comes down to dealing with the problems and moving on, no matter how much we don't want to do just that!The book is so well-written that it took me two days just to get over the hurt and the pain that I experienced while reading it. I'd quote this book as a \"Strong dose of emotions\", that too mostly negative ones, so if you can't take strong emotional ups and downs, then unfortunately this book is not for you.This Is Sarah is about the sudden disappearance of Sarah and how it affects the lives of people around her, her family, boyfriend and friends. Her parent's marriage falls apart, her sister breaks completely and her boyfriend is on the verge of completely going insane.The best part about the book is that the emotions are perfectly real and so are the actions and reactions of characters, which connects you with them instantly. This book cannot be described in words, you have to read it if you want to experience what it's like to lose someone, without knowing what happened to them. The ending is bitter yet appropriate.The BadThe only thing bad that I can think of is the strong and negative emotional content.The RomanceColin's love for Sarah is the purest love I've read about in a very long time. Being away from Sarah is destroying him bit by bit and slowly-slowly he is falling apart is just on the verge of being declared insane.Sarah's parents love her so much that the pain of being away from her took over them and destroyed their otherwise happy marriage. Sarah's younger sister, Claire also loves her immensely and her disappearance affected her very badly.Everyone loved Sarah tremendously which, in the second half of the book, starts to play tricks with Clair's mind. She starts feeling that all the love and care is only for Sarah and that it wouldn't have been there if it were for Claire's disappearance.Also, though Colin was Sarah's boyfriend, Claire loved him with all her heart and at one point tries to take Sarah's place in Colin's life after Sarah's disappearance.ConclusionThis Is Sarah is a brilliant book by Ally Malinenko. It's a very unique book which is a bit high on emotions, but at the end that's what separates it from other YA books.I'd not recommend it to readers who can't handle strong emotions and negative reading environment.It will serve you well to think twice before reading it. I'd say if you can then give it a try, it will be a very unique reading experience."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22493530-jennifer", "userReview": "Today's Psychocat Reads Review is THIS IS SARAH by Ally Malinenko.(I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review).Most of the books I've reviewed here have been some variety of fantasy or romance. Then there is this one. THIS IS SARAH is a short book, but Ally managed to cram enough FEELS to fill a George R. R. Martin sized book into the pages. Seriously, I haven't busted out a gif in a book review in a while, but this one earned it.Sitting down to write this review, it dawned on me that in some ways Ally's book reminds me Jodi Picoult's work. Take that as high praise because she is one of my absolute favorite authors. Both women are capable of bringing incredibly tough and emotional material to life in the pages of their books. I am a complete sucker for a well-written book that tries to tear my heart to pieces. Though the story really isn't a romance, the three primary Psychocat Reads criteria still apply. Characters: The book may be titled THIS IS SARAH, but in reality it is Sarah's boyfriend, Collin, and her sister, Claire, that you cozy up to throughout the pages. Following these two young people through what will likely be one of the toughest journeys of their lives means seeing them at their worst. Ally pulls us into their lives, letting us see how they cope in the midst of tragedy. She's done an excellent job of creating very real characters. Relationships: THIS IS SARAH isn't focused on any single relationship, though Collin and Claire both flashback to moments they shared with Sarah. The book does a remarkable job of bringing in elements of the relationships between various family members and friends. It shows what the tragedy of losing someone close does to your relationships with the people that remain. It's not always pretty, but it is real and beautiful to read. Too Perfect or Perfectly Flawed: This is a beautifully flawed story of what it means to live. A story that captures the very human experiences of loving, losing, and learning to live on when the unexpected happens.Jen's Final Rating: 5 Heartrending Stars!! Grab a copy of the book, grab some tissues, and settle in to read. This may not be a light-hearted beach read, but it is well worth your time.Psychocat's Final Rating: Emotionally challenged though she may be, Psychocat would very much like to know what happened to Sarah, and exact an appropriate punishment."}, {"userName": "diana marcela Ballestas", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30495517-diana-marcela-ballestas", "userReview": "esta es la historia de Sarah, pero a diferencia de muchos libros Sarah no es la protagonista, no vemos la vida a trav\u00e9s de sus ojos.

I haven't read a book that has kept me up for a long time, but this book made sure i was not sleeping until the final page. Brilliantly written, the reader is listening to their friends talk to them.

You know what to do.\"This is Sarah is a harrowing tale about the disappearance of a teenage girl and the devastating impact it has on the two people closest to her. Although the book is called This is Sarah, it isn\u2019t Sarah\u2019s story, but rather the story of the people Sarah left behind.Although the subject matter of This is Sarah is tough to stomach, it was one of my favorite reads of 2014. The story is told from alternating POV between Sarah\u2019s boyfriend, Colin, and her sister, Claire. It was an emotional journey through the minds of both Colin and Claire. Colin struggled to deal with his own anger and grief, while Claire was suffocated by the impact Sarah\u2019s disappearance had on her family. It was devastating seeing them both react to Sarah\u2019s disappearance.\"Where are you, sweetheart? Where did you go that you can't come back from? Why can't you come back?\" I really liked both Claire and Colin. I thought Malinenko really breathed life into them. I think it would have been easy for Claire and Colin to tell us about their grief and pain and devastation but instead through Malinenko\u2019s words the reader is really able to feel what they both felt. I was really able to delve into the deepest, darkest parts of both characters thoughts. I think the rawness and realness of both characters was what drew me into the story most. It was painful to see both characters suffer through this tragedy but what I found most heartbreaking was Claire\u2019s struggle. Not only was her sister likely abducted, but she also felt the \u201csurvivor\u2019s guilt\u201d of being the sister left behind. Her whole world was turned upside down and she wasn\u2019t able to find solace in her family, instead she found more pain. This was really hard for me to stomach. As for Colin, his love for Sarah was one of the purest loves. He is undeniably loyal to her, even a year after her disappearance. However, his feelings for her and the guilt he feels over her disappearance is crippling and begins to tear his world apart.\"I still see her face, turned up at me, with that smile. My God, how she smiled.\"The mystery that surrounded Sarah\u2019s disappearance kept me thoroughly engrossed and invested in the story. Malinenko was able to plant seeds of doubt in my mind that left me wondering if someone closest to Sarah could indeed be responsible for her disappearance. I enjoyed the artful way the mystery was entwined with the characters\u2019 stories.With its gut-wrenching and heartbreaking subject matter, This is Sarah is a powerful book that will take readers on an emotional rollercoaster. Although I found the ending to be rather satisfying, This is Sarah is definitely one of those stories that concentrates more on the journey than the destination so it may leave some readers wanting more. I highly recommend this book and I look forward to reading more from Malinenko in the future!"}, {"userName": "Ione Butterfly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27751937-ione-butterfly", "userReview": "It Seems Similar to the The Storyteller: A love story, a mistery, a crime (maybe) An Winter atmosphere...

While Claire, Sarah's sister, finds herself the only member of her family who seems to care about keeping things together, Colin, Sarah's boyfriend, finds himself rapidly falling apart as he gets into a routine of calling Sarah's missing cellphone daily and fighting the world around him to keep hope alive that Sarah will return. This book is equal parts emotional portrait and page-turning mystery. The sadness and loss and frustration are real, as every character in the book deals with the open-ended tragedy that has occurred. The writing is intimate and detailed when dealing with Claire and Colin's feelings, and even supporting characters have complex reactions and conflicting emotions as everyone just tries to do their best to cope. But as we try to heal along with these characters, clues surface and questions arise. What did happen to Sarah? Will she be found? Is she alive? Why haven't they found her phone? Sarah's phone becomes the center of the mystery for Colin, and us, when one day, after a year of unanswered ringing, Sarah's voicemail suddenly clicks on. Colin takes it as the sign he'd been waiting for.Malinenko does a fantastic job of balancing the emotion and the mystery of this story. I found myself able to enjoy, if that's the right word, the simple moments of pain and loss on one page, then to get sucked back into the hope and sleuthing on the next. Colin's hope and single-mindedness is infectious, it's hard not to believe him, extremely hard not to root for him, but at the same time, we hear the people around him constantly telling him he has become dangerously obsessed and possibly delusional, which it's also hard not to believe. A fantastically complex place to put me in as reader!I won't get into the details of the ending, but what happened I didn't see coming. Some mysteries have answers and some don't. This book sets me up for disappointment while feeding the flame of hope that all will somehow end well.

On the day she disappeared he lost his mind. His world collapsed, he lost his will to live, he lost his ability to care and he was crumbling from the inside out. He kept holding onto the thought that maybe just maybe Sarah was still out there and that he had to be the one to save her. He spent countless days calling her phone hoping she would answer and then one day her voicemail had managed to pick up this was one year after she\u2019d gone missing. He kept calling her after that leaving her messages hoping that she would call back but she didn\u2019t and he kept holding onto hope, hope that she was out there, hope that he just needed to find her, hope that in a sense she was alive.Claire Evans was a Sarah\u2019s younger sister. She had always wished that she had what Sarah had including Colin. Claire learns how hard it is to live through the loss of her sister and in her own way she wanted to help Colin. She had always loved Colin and wanted him to be okay. She did a lot of not smart things throughout the book that could get her in a lot of trouble but in the end she didn\u2019t have anything to do with her sister going missing.The two of them struggle with accepting that Sarah isn\u2019t coming back and it isn\u2019t until the end of the book that for both of them they are finally able to let go. They can finally let Sarah go and start living their lives for themselves instead of everybody else. Well Colin wasn\u2019t living for everyone else he was stuck in this world where Sarah was alive in his head and as long as she was there everything was okay because he didn\u2019t have to let go. Claire was the one living for everyone else and because of that things were not well for her. Her mother left, her father wanted to pack up and move away, the uncertainty of not knowing what happened to Sarah is what was tearing the family apart. Because of all that uncertainty no one knew how to deal with what was all taking place. No one knew really how to heal or accept it all and because of all that it made it difficult to move on.This book is a wonderfully well written book. It\u2019s tone is perfect and it does have it\u2019s moments where it may make you tear up or even cry. It is a good book for anyone to read that had been forced to deal with the loss of a loved one. The loss of someone that you have no answers for because they are simply gone and aren\u2019t coming back. There are so many more things that could have been covered in this book in regards to this topic, but the things that were covered helped to make a good book. The most important thing I got out of reading this book is that you need to accept what is going on before you can move on and heal. Acceptance is that last part of the healing process and getting there can sometimes be an overwhelming and bumpy road. This book can help other\u2019s to know that they are not alone and that others too have been through what they are going through, it can maybe help others to learn to live their lives again.Quotes i liked} \u2013 01} \u201cI\u2019m eighteen, about to graduate, and, in a few months, I\u2019m suppose to go to college and pretend that everything is okay. I can\u2019t wrap my brain around that. Nothing is okay. It hasn\u2019t been the same since the last time I saw Sarah. That was when time cracked, splintered like a broken bone, and no matter how hard I try to hold it together, everything falls apart. -Colin02} In a single moment, Sarah vanished, and the world shifter forever on its axis. It can do that. It can keep going on for everyone else, spinning around, day in day out: morning, school, home, bed, morning, school, home, bed, lather, rinse, repeat. It goes on for everyone else, but then for some of us, like me, it comes to a screeching halt. -Colin03} I used to be jealous of how Sarah was, but now I felt guilty for even thinking such a thing. All the complex emotions vanished when Sarah disappeared. I only wanted one thing- to get her back, to get our life back to normal. \u2013 Claire04} Sometimes I wondered if every time I came in this room, I made it a little less Sarah\u2019s. Like my being here pushed her out. I didn\u2019t want to push her out; I just wanted to bring her back. \u2013 Claire05} High School wasn\u2019t the kind of thing you just float through. It was a jungle, something my parents didn\u2019t understand. \u2013 Claire06} It\u2019s so easy to be unnoticeable. It\u2019s actually comforting, like floating downstream.

A teenage girl from a small town in Colorado, who goes missing. The duel protagonists are Sarah's next door neighbour, and boyfriend, Colin, and her younger sister, Claire. The story follows the year in their lives after her disappearance, and how they each deal with the pain of their loss, and the frustration of not having any tangible answers about what happened.I wasn't too sure what to expect when I picked this book up. I partially expected a lighthearted YA mystery, where the heartbroken boyfriend and the plucky younger sister team up to uncover the mystery of Sarah's disappearance, Paper Towns-style. However, this is not that. At all. Sarah is no Pixie McQuirkyname and there is no intricate trail of breadcrumbs that lead to her whereabouts. She is gone. Taken. Probably murdered. She has left a gaping hole in a lot of lives, and nobody really knows how the fuck to deal with that. This is a character study. A study in love, loss and the absolute kick in the bollocks that is ambiguous grief.There are not many books that truly hook me, and force me to keep reading when I know I should be going to sleep, but this was one of them. I have always hated the term \"page turner\", because I so rarely come across them, but This Is Sarah is one of them. 100%.

My instincts were 100% on the mark with This Is Sarah. It\u2019s the type of novel your eyes and mind want to devour in a single sitting, which is totally feasible. Don\u2019t let the book\u2019s compact size, however, fool you into thinking that it\u2019s short on emotional punch because by the time I finished reading it, my heart had been thoroughly hammered. And then some.Sarah Evans is the character who lends her name to the book\u2019s title, and the impact of her disappearance on her boyfriend, Colin Leventhal, and younger sister, Claire, drives the novel. Both Colin and Claire narrate the story, and it\u2019s through their eyes that you learn who Sarah was, the Sarah they loved and the Sarah who\u2019s left a chasm in their hearts and lives that\u2019s seemingly impossible to fill. Believe me when I say your own heart will break over and over again for the searing loss that Colin and Claire feel and what they experience in the aftermath of Sarah going missing. Claire practically becomes invisible to her parents, who are facing their own difficulties coping with the tragedy that has struck their family and so are not in an ideal position to offer comfort to their remaining child.As for Colin, his chapters are utterly, utterly, utterly gut-wrenching. That is not an exaggeration. His life has fractured into a billion pieces. Sarah was his world, and the absolutely desperate hope that he has that she\u2019s alive is his only oxygen. His pain is so brutal and raw that it\u2019s not far into the novel before you, too, hope Sarah is okay, if only to see Colin stop hurting so much. This is a young man with his whole life ahead of him who should be looking forward to going to college instead of calling his missing girlfriend\u2019s phone multiple times a day to hear her voicemail greeting. Almost everyone around Colin\u2014his parents, his friends\u2014thinks he\u2019s headed for a breakdown, if he\u2019s not there already. As you read, you understand where their alarm comes from, yet you also see where the things he does make sense to him in his state of mind. Colin is a meticulously crafted character, as are all of the characters, and so real that it\u2019s very easy to forget he exists in the pages of a book.This is one of the most realistic contemporary YA novels I\u2019ve read, and that\u2019s because of the writing. The prose in this book\u2014it\u2019s beautiful, bordering on poetic. Not a single word is extraneous. As somber as the tone of the book is, it never feels overwrought or cloying. Every line of dialogue sounds like it would be spoken by an actual person. In keeping with its realism, This Is Sarah doesn\u2019t offer any easy answers, and that\u2019s just another reason why I loved it, even as it broke the vital organ that\u2019s responsible for that particular emotion."}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10627459-tammy", "userReview": "This Is Sarah is a wonderful book about love, loss and coping.

But if you're up for a gut-wrenching true-to-life tale that taps into the emotions and psychology (and near-psychosis) of loss and uncertainty, regrets and \"what ifs,\" I highly recommend this book. Most books involving a missing person scenario tell the tale from the POV of the parents of that person or the law enforcement personnel involved in the search. Not this one. This one examines the angst of not knowing and wishful thinking from the missing Sarah's boyfriend's and sister's points of view, and does so brilliantly. Occasional blog posts written by Sarah prior to her disappearance are also included, which serves to make the missing Sarah more \"real\" to readers, and adds to the poignancy of her mysterious disappearance. What can I say? This book is extremely well-written, with the ability to engage readers and make them care. Be on the lookout for more books from this author.

I don't usually pick up emotionally heavy books, but I loved the concept behind this one so much. The author explores the grief process thoroughly, and the ending had me guessing up until the last couple pages. My hopes paralleled Colin's, as he struggled to believe his girlfriend might suddenly turn up. I was rolled along with his roller coaster of anger, lies and hope. I enjoyed how the author utilized phone messages, letters, and blog posts to give us the full picture of Colin and Sarah's lives. It was done so well. While I loved this book, there was significant language throughout. It felt real and very true to life because of that, but for those who don't like language, you've been warned.

If you've ever wondered what it's like to have a loved one suddenly disappear, this book will give you very thorough insight."}, {"userName": "Mlpmom (Book Reviewer)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3829694-mlpmom-book-reviewer", "userReview": "Malinenko has managed to create a beautifully written coming of age story about loss, love, grief and hope that anyone would surly be able to relate to.The emotions in this are so tangible that you can't help but feel Colin's struggle with his grief and despair and your heart will ache for him every step of the way as his and Sarah's story unfolds and the journey to healing begins.Riddles with heartfelt moments that will take your breath away this is truly one read that you don't want to miss out on.

And yet, even though the intensely painful subject matter of This is Sarah might make for a somewhat difficult read for some, I found the book quite mesmerizing. The characters stayed with me, haunting my day-to-day (and keeping me up a few nights) as I wondered how the remainder of the book was going to play out. I found myself getting up early before work and taking extended lunch breaks to get a few more chapters in. Which means Malinenko was doing her job. Reminded me of Willy Vlautin at times. Excited to see more from this new voice in fiction."}, {"userName": "Donna Huber", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/156750-donna-huber", "userReview": "It is not your typical missing person's novel. It is more focused on those left behind, in particular Sarah's boyfriend and her sister. It was interesting, but it wasn't as engaging as I hoped. I kept reading more to see if we did find out what happened to Sarah more than to see how the characters dealt with their grief.
