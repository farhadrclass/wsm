Yet, more girls are \u201con the edge\u201d, why? Leonard Sax explores the possible reasons why our young daughters are not as happy and adjusted as we want them to be. Could it be the early sexualisation of girls? Could it be technology which keeps them connected 24*7 to their friends preventing them from being connected to their true selves? Is it because technology like social media is forcing them to present themselves as others want to see them rather than as they are? Could it be the toxins in their food, hair products and creams? The author discusses all of these topics in detail, backed by research and then provides us with practical strategies for parenting a girl, to help her develop into her authentic self, to become the woman she is meant to be and to be a happy, well adjusted member of her family and society.I was surprised when this book was suggested for our book club. I started reading it with a great deal of skepticism as it was different from the kind of books we normally read - typically literary fiction. However I enjoyed the book and would go so far as to say that it is a Must Read for parents of daughters and anyone (grandparents, uncles, aunts, and teachers) who has the opportunity to participate in the raising of a girl. The book also gets the reader thinking about current culture and lifestyle. Are we forming real relationships? Are we living authentic lives? Has our life become a performance meant always to please and stay popular? Have we lost that sense of community in which a young girl forged relationships with so many people of varying ages? This is a very good book. I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/609478-brenda", "userReview": "2016 - Reread for book club.2012 - A really, really good read. I devoured this book. I didn't realize it at the time, but I have read another of his books - 'Why Gender Matters'. I came away with an understanding of some of the problems that face girls today. What I also understood is how inspired the 'For Strength of Youth', 'Personal Progress', and the whole Young Women's program really is. It really sets girls apart and can strengthen them in this day and age. I also felt vindicated because the doctor/author said we should have our kids's phones in our room at 10:00 at night and not let them have a computer in their room but in a common area where we can keep an eye on what they are viewing."}, {"userName": "Jay", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3255414-jay", "userReview": "Like \"Boys Adrift,\" this book has a lot of information that I was happy to learn, and I'm glad the author wrote a book about girls. Never having been a your girl in my years growing up, some of the ideas were very new to me. One thing that struck me -- maybe it was in \"Boys Adrift,\" too, and I simply didn't notice -- is that he gives you a horror story, something really bad that happened, and only afterwords says \"now that's a rare case, but...\" It seems to me that's a propaganda trick: \"If you don't follow my advice, think what horrible things can occur.\" I still think that a lot of the information is useful, thus the high rating, but I wish the presentation would've been a little different."}, {"userName": "Julia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31686112-julia", "userReview": "Girls on the Edge was hard to read at times!

In this particular book, physician and psychologist Leonard Sax, who previously penned a similar book about boys, examines what he believes are four factors impacting the current society in which girls are growing up. These are sexual identity, the cyberbubble, obsessions, and environmental toxins. He dedicates a chapter to each, as well as drawing connections between the various factors. One issue addressed in the sexuality chapter which I have not seen mentioned often in other texts is the increasing \u201ccool\u201d factor of bisexuality and lesbianism. In his chapter on technology, Sax points to sleep deprivation as a factor in the overdiagnosis and medicating of ADHD. In the final chapters, Sax also addresses the importance of feeding the mind, body, and soul of young women, making some interesting points about the differences in physical education, academic education, and religious education for boys and girls.Though this book does not present a particularly comprehensive look at the adolescence of girls (as evidenced by the title itself), it does make good points about the four titular issues, some of which have yet to be addressed in depth in other materials.

In his book _Girls On the Edge_, Leonard Sax identifies the four key factors that are creating what he terms the \"new crisis for girls.\" These factors include:1. Sexual identity--young girls are acting sexual before they even are sexual, and despite their appearances, are more confused and insecure than ever before2. The cyberbubble--being constantly connected online has resulted in girls disconnecting from their true selves and in-person relationships3. Obsessions--the fixations that result in attempts to cope with overwhelming anxiety and depression and fill the black hole that resides where identity and self-esteem should be4. Environmental toxins--endocrine disruptors found in the environment that result in an earlier onset of puberty, which, in turn, causes increased risk for depression, anxiety and substance abuseIf you're the parent of an adolescent girl, this book may be a lifesaver. A true eye opener, it is filled with a plethora of insight and information.

BPA in plastics of all kinds are influencing our bodies is scary and unknowable ways, and sadly kids are getting more of it even than adults. In my house, I recently tossed all the crappy mismatched plastic containers used by my wife and asked her to start using only glass and ceramic for microwave warming. This book notes that now puberty for girls at age 8 is not considered unusual, and in fact may be traceable to the drop in breast feeding among American women. More formula equals more plastic bottles and nipples. There is much more here. The author zeros in on 4 issues, including the role on texting/computers, obsessive behaviors and sexual identity's generated by the mass media - plus toxins. All of this is having an impact on girls specifically that is upsetting. The book hits many other themes: he supports single-sex classrooms, uniforms to discourage showoffs and schools where teachers spend time with students at lunch. But he also talks about sports and says parents are wise to advise their kids to stay away from gymnastics, figure skating and cheerleading - because all 3 focus on how you look, rather than what you do. Although the writing is a bit stilted and this author comes across as fairly preachy and overbearing, he lays out some compelling evidence.

Most of it is common sense. Girls are different than boys. Right-o. Heard this many a time. But in a way he's almost reinforcing the stereotypes, even though he's meaning not too. Keep the computers out of their rooms - check. Monitor their cell phone use - check. His mean girls assessment was a little off the mark, unrealistic mainly, and truly if you've never been female, that's a hard one to really understand. But I could tell he meant well overall and that he cares about children and the dangers they face today. Which is many. And now I'm a little more frightened, for them, and for me as their parent. Oh, and I did learn a thing or two about arm pit hair. Studies have shown that male and female offspring can identify their father's armpit hair just by smelling pieces of it. We can identify the pheromones of our parents! If we're not too grossed out in the process...I guess.

In my review of Boys Adrift I wrote that parents of both boys and girls could benefit from reading it; Girls on the Edge is really more useful to parents of girls. I like how he conquered dilemmas facing girls of this generation through perspectives of mind, body and spirit. While boys appear to be 'adrift' nowadays, girls have become more competitive and lose sight of WHO they are and focus on WHAT they are.

Very intriguing and somewhat disturbing. I was hooked when he started describing a phenomena I've observed but not known how to describe, girls being, for lack of any better phrase, sexualized before they have even come close to figuring out who they are, their personal identity. He raises questions about the early onset of puberty, the ways girls learn differently from boys, how much gender behavior is nurture vs nature (you know the test where boys and girls are given the same toys to play with - boys spend most of their time playing with the trucks, girls will split their time between the trucks and dolls, weighted a bit more towards the dolls - they conducted it with monkeys and were shocked to find the results were very nearly the same), social media, healthy and mental health issues, lot of things to think about. It was hard not to mark up the pages. Hard. I highly recommend this to anyone with daughters, anyone who cares about girls and young women.

Of course it is quite timely for me as I navigate the terrain of 4- and 7-year old daughters, however, it is is an extremely informative book for just about anyone to read, illuminating much about themselves and their relationships. The book covers the expected, like over-sexualization of young girls and cyber concerns, but I was genuinely surprised at how much it opened my eyes to several previously unacknowledged notions, e.g. social websites contributing to a under-developed core identity. I am also quite sold on single gender education/school for social, physical, educational, and too many specific reasons to go into here, but needless to say, prior to reading this book, I never so much as considered the possibility of enrolling my children in an all girls school.

And the author does an excellent job of making and elucidating this point in four primary examples, and many related ones.Additionally This book, to me, is relevant to the roiling conversation about whether we have entered an age of \"The End of Man\". It is tough to live through a paradigm shift. Particularly, I think, when the paradigm that is shifting is central to developing one's identity, sense of self, basic understandings of thier relationships, and purpose in the world.

For instance, we should be talking much more about environmental exposures when discussing obesity. Some of the advice is common sense, but some of it goes beyond the existing science. Generally this is harmless because there's little downside, for example, to using glass bowls instead of plastic bowls in the microwave, if you can. But in some other areas the simplistic solutions seem potentially damaging. A few survey studies and animal experiments don't necessarily translate into good public policy. The author should be clearer that these are his best guesses of what we should do, but that they are not supported by strong evidence of what actually helps.

I loved how he wrote this. Very informative but not too boring. Just the right amount of studies to keep me interested! Love it. Must read for anyone with girls. He broke it down to how a girl needs to be healthy in different areas of her life:Emotional: that's a big one. How it's good for girls to be friends with older ladies. For example, one girl had a boyfriend and her friends thought he was awesome bc he was the football star. But she talked with some older girls at work and they said he was using her and it turns out she dumped him and he didn't end up even caring! Plus all the facts it shared about sexuality! Wow. How girls are forced to act sexual before they are even ready to understand what that means. And it's getting earlier and earlier. And it's no big deal. But it isAnd that kid years are just so precious! Basically HAVE FRIENDS. NOT TOO MANY. MOSTLY FEMALEAlso boys are ADHD and girls are depressed! Way way more depressed! Physical: girl exercise is so so important! And girls never exercise as hard with boys in the room (yes the author is pro girls school) I loved the dodgeball example. and also how they follow our example and their bones basically stop growing and you have to get them strong bones as kids or else! Don't let them do just one thing... let them try lots of sports or teams or things. (Just not cheerleading! They had the most injuries l)Spirituality: pray! Even if you are. Not religious... pray! It keeps them off drugs and alcohol.... like 40%!! That's crazy!! It makes such a difference in girls. Education: they should not be taught the same as boys! Our brains are wired completely different! And I love that my girls have uniforms! They did a test and when girls took a test in a bathing suit, with no one on the room, and no windows, they did 40% worse!!! Wow. What they are wearing matters. And they learn and want to know \"what is it?\" And boys want to know \"where is it going and how fast it is moving\". Two completely different brain systems! Crazy.

The flow of the solutions part of the book was different than that of the first half, but still I thought both sections of the book were useful. In terms of defining the problems for some tween and teen girls, the author noted initially that hard-working girls with drive and motivation in abundance were still struggling, but this could be turned around with input from parents that were willing to look at 21st century problems with new solutions (since some of the girl-specific issues didn't exist three decades ago). The main goal is to help your daughter develop a sense of self that is deep-rooted so she will grow up to be a resilient and self-confident woman. Developing a sense of self is about connecting with yourself and developing a sense of personhood and appreciation of your uniqueness, not for your looks or who you hang out with or what you achieve academically or in sports. Girls with a strong sense of self do not need to compensate for something that is missing in their lives. Problem 1: Our culture is pushing girls to present themselves sexually at an earlier age, which equates to becoming an object of pleasure for others to look at. Today's message to girls is that revealing their body is a valid means of self-expression and \"girl power,\" but we must reject that girls need to reveal their bodies to empower themselves, boys don't. Interestingly and sadly, the culture and images presented today encourage girls to be ashamed if they are not experienced (and it is somewhat shameful to be a virgin). Solution: help daughters define themselves by who they are not how they look. Also, help them to feel comfortable with the choice to wait to engage in sex (including oral sex) because at too early an age, it is likely to lead to depression. Give them an out with their friends (i.e. blaming you) for some of their choices (for example, the clothes they wear). Let girls be girls and don't push them into adulthood too quickly.Problem 2: Electronics and social networking sites are creating situations of hyper-connectedness with peers, but a disconnect from their own identity. They cyberbubble is not the real world and may not only decrease math and reading performance, but also lessen one's ability to interact in the real world. As same-age peer influence increases through the social networking sites, parents, siblings, extended family, and different-age peers are becoming irrelevant. Same-age peers do not have sufficient life experience to be good guides. Before 24/7 availablity of an individual, girls were able to take a break and have more privacy. This allowed her to develop a sense of self and gave her a break from being bombarded with the perceptions of others. Taking a break to \"chill\" allows them time to connect with themselves and reflect not only who they are, but what they want to become. Solution: help our daughters use technology appropriately and also encourage them to have older friends, including relationships with adults older than their parents to bridge the generations because knowledge is not a substitute for wisdom. Problem 3: Some girls interests become fixations and one-dimensional, thus creating an obsession that may lead to destructive choices and behaviors. Girls who do not know who they are (and have \"anorexia of the soul\") are more vulnerable to obsessions. Solution: Identify if an interest (in sports, fitness or grades) is healthy or destructive and intervene and provide guidance if the girl is on the edge of embracing unhealthy opportunities. Periodically ask your daughter open-ended questions about herself as \"tell me about yourself\" should evolve from somethign superficial and concrete to seomthing more substansive and abstract (what they want as goals, how they see themselves now compared to their past and future). Find teachers that care about girls becase knowing a teacher really cares and truly emphathizes is a powerful motivator. Understand that coaches and gym teachers matter and there's a difference between girls' and boys' bodies and how they respond to sports (for injury prevention and confidence-building). Problem 4: Our environment has toxins that may be causing accelerated puberty, which may have harmful consequences. Solution: Examine product choices and steer our girls towards better options or avoidance of items that may cause harm. Seek sources that are BPA-free and phthalate-free. Encourage a good intereaction with the daughter and her biological father. Encourage appropriate exercise. With regards to a girl's spiritual dimension, Dr. Sax encourages adults to suport and nurture them, even though it may not be easy since it may be a direction that is different than the parents. \"If you fail to nurture your daughter's budding spirituality, then it may be extinguished. And if that happens, then your daughter will be at risk for the all-too-common substitution of sexuality in place of spirituality.\" Alos, the spiritual journey is so important because \"life dosen't go as planned\" (death and loss occur and disappointment hurts). Life is not just mind and body, but also soul. Essentially, the author sums up his most important advice as (p. 211): Have friends.

I have two teen girls and wish I had read it earlier. A lot of what he says hits home, if not with my girls then with their friends. The book does scare you but I think the presentation of worse-case scenarios makes you take him seriously enough to motivate change. I wish more educators and coaches would read the book. Parents could use help from others leaders in their lives and it will take a combined effort to enact the course corrections recommended."}, {"userName": "Andy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7169720-andy", "userReview": "Really interesting research on raising girls.
