Her memoir took place during the year leading up to the Tet Offensive, when things turned sour for the American soldiers stationed there. I am old enough to remember the war taking place, and I recall seeing it on the nightly news, but River City recalls the horrors in a much more personal way. Walsh does a great job describing the almost unbelievable conditions the medical team worked under; lack of supplies, lack of hygiene, rampant disease, inconsistent power, etc. You truly get a feel for what it was like to work under the most trying conditions, including some bosses who were never around to understand what was really happening, crazy bureaucracy, some Vietnamese who made things worse, and bombs going off frequently.We were lucky enough to have the author lead the Book Club discussion, so that was a real treat."}], "description": "Patricia L. Walsh grew up the eighth of fifteen children in a poor Minnesota farm family and worked her way through nursing school and anesthesia training. In 1967, she volunteered to go to Vietnam to care for civilians caught in the crossfire. She injured her back in the Tet Offensive and returned home in denial of the severe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) she had developed. RIVER CITY chronicles the dedication, self sacrifice, trials and triumphs of practicing combat medicine.", "title": "River City a Nurse's Year in Vietnam", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6323564-river-city-a-nurse-s-year-in-vietnam", "average": 4.17, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348942456l/6323564.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1810713.Patricia_L_Walsh", "name": "Patricia L.
