I have just re-read one of his better early novels, Billard um halbzehn (1959),(**) and am once again seduced by the many fine qualities of his prose.Though those of my generation may roll their eyes at this truism, it could well be the case that members of more recent generations are unaware that, for completely understandable reasons, in the first decade after World War II the German people had no desire to dwell on what had occurred from 1933 to 1945. After all, they were hungry, their cities were in ruins, their country was divided in two and occupied by four foreign powers, just to mention a few things. In East Germany the Communist Party was able to blame the \"other Germans\" - a stance which the East German people were gratefully able to adopt - while in West Germany conservative capitalists had taken over the reins again after only a brief interruption and did not want anyone looking too closely at what they did during the war. This began to change a bit during the late 50's and early 60's after the \"Economic Miracle\" of the 50's had greatly improved the standard of living in the Federal Republic.B\u00f6ll was one of the first significant German authors to deal with WW2; already in 1949 he published Der Zug war p\u00fcnktlich, set in 1943, in which he, among other things, displayed the inhumanity of the values of that time. But already in that early text he was no one-note-Charlie. Indeed, in another famous quote B\u00f6ll said that the most important topics for him were religion and love.So, though WW2 plays an important role in Billard um halbzehn, quite a bit more is going on in this tale of three generations of architects, the F\u00e4hmel family, leading up to the fateful 80th birthday of the eldest, Heinrich. B\u00f6ll artfully eases into his story by introducing the F\u00e4hmel's through the eyes of the secretary of F\u00e4hmel #2, Robert, with humor and foreboding. B\u00f6ll's third person narrator moves among the characters and follows their thoughts and, above all, their memories, jumping through time from as early as 1894 till the novel's present, 1958. The reader must piece together the story from this kaleidoscope, but B\u00f6ll does not make this difficult. In fact, there is a hint of the pleasure of reading a well written detective story as the pieces slowly fall together. At the same time an ominous tension is established and increased until the final explosion.Within this rich story of the intertwined lives of multiple generations, of joy and loss, of ambition and futility, betrayal and forgiveness, subservience and resistance, is mixed the many different ways people could and did choose to act during the period 1933-1945 and the price each had to pay for their choices. At the same time, B\u00f6ll also addresses the ways in which Germans dealt with the consequences of these choices in the emerging postwar society. All the while, even when evoking the former Nazi who became an important figure in the postwar reconstruction or when Robert is being whipped with barbed wire, B\u00f6ll's limpid prose flows smoothly and calmly, never psychologizing and occasionally revealing a wry humor that had me laughing aloud. The old hotel porter, Jochen, is priceless.This is one of B\u00f6ll's generous handful of outstanding books.(*) The well-known quote by B\u00f6ll means: Atheists bore me, they are always talking about God. Not actually relevant here, but I like the photo.(**) Available in English translation under the title Billiards at Half-Past Nine.

Evoke nothing, never expect to bring back childhood's austerity of feeling in adult souls grown soft...\" Memory can be messy. What a father remembers may look completely different from how a son remembers it. This is especially true with a war thrown into the mix because suddenly the world stands on it's head and spins backwards - especially if that war took place in Germany. Billiards is about one German family, specifically three generations of men in the family- all architects- who build, demolish, and rebuild over the course of the war. However, don't be fooled by simple explanations. this book is SO much more than the actual events that took place because the story unravels as each of the characters take their turn to detail the inner ramblings of their mind's past. Each point of view tells part of the past which becomes relevant on one present day and centers around St. Anthony Abbey. Billiards is one of the most stylistically brilliant books I have ever read. Read this book like you would eat an expensive fillet. Boll's sentences must be chewed thoroughly and savored. Throughout this book I was slightly confused trying to piece the names, places and events together. Do not read this book if you enjoy being told EXACTLY what to think by an author. Instead, this book does an excellent job making you feel like a confused outsider- much like the characters felt surviving in Nazi Germany. The story starts to make sense a little more than halfway through. Read this book if you enjoyed Memento."}, {"userName": "Miss Ravi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21314656-miss-ravi", "userReview": "\u0641\u0631\u0645 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0631\u0627 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u067e\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0645. \u062a\u063a\u06cc\u06cc\u0631 \u0632\u0627\u0648\u06cc\u0647 \u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0648 \u062c\u0627\u0628\u0647\u200c\u062c\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0645\u064f\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u0622\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647 \u0634\u062e\u0635\u06cc\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0647\u0645\u0647\u200c\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u067e\u0631 \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0632 \u0648 \u0646\u0634\u06cc\u0628\u06cc \u0647\u0645 \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0647\u200c\u0627\u0646\u062f. \u062f\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639 \u0645\u0634\u06a9\u0644\u200c\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u0627 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u062f\u0631\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u062c\u0646\u06af \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u067e\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0632\u062f \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u062e\u0637 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u0634\u062e\u0635\u06cc \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f \u0648 \u06a9\u064f\u0646\u0634\u06cc \u0627\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0642 \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0627\u0641\u062a\u062f. \u0647\u0645\u0647\u200c\u0686\u06cc\u0632 \u062f\u0631 \u06af\u0630\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0641\u062a\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0634\u062f\u0647. \u0634\u062e\u0635\u06cc\u062a\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u064f\u0646\u0634\u06cc \u06cc\u0627 \u067e\u0627\u062f\u0648\u06cc \u0647\u062a\u0644 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u06cc\u0641 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u0634\u06cc \u0648 \u067e\u0627\u062f\u0648\u06cc \u0647\u062a\u0644 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u062c\u0628\u0648\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u0648\u0631\u0627\u062c\u06cc \u0622\u0646\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u06af\u0648\u0634 \u062f\u0647\u062f \u0628\u06cc \u0622\u0646\u200c\u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u062f\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0647 \u06a9\u062c\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0633\u0646\u062f! \u0627\u0646\u0631\u0698\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0635\u062f \u0635\u0641\u062d\u0647\u200c\u06cc \u0627\u0628\u062a\u062f\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0641\u0631\u0648\u06a9\u0634 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0646\u06cc \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u062c\u0632 \u0628\u0627\u0632\u0634\u0646\u0648\u06cc\u06cc \u0648\u0642\u0627\u06cc\u0639 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u0622\u062f\u0645\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0650 \u062f\u0631\u06af\u06cc\u0631 \u062c\u0646\u06af\u060c \u0686\u06cc\u0632 \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631\u06cc \u062f\u0633\u062a\u062a \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u06af\u06cc\u0631\u062f."}, {"userName": "Katia N", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n", "userReview": "It is amazing how a prose can be so effortlessly beautiful and meaningful at the same time! It is also such a rarity\u2026 The novel takes place during one day in 1958 in Cologne. It is focused on the 3 generation of the family of architects getting to grips with the trauma inflicted on them by their compatriots and by the defeat in the war. It reminds also that the spectre of Evil is never far away; it just reincarnates into different shapes and forms. But the novel refuses to be deductive and does not have any recipe how to fight it though. It asks the question what is better to build or to destroy? To destroy something which has been built earlier, which might have been a wrong symbol\u2026 Or the symbol which did not safe anything or anyone\u2026 Or is the act of creation and destruction are the part of the same process? Hegel with his unity and conflicts of the opposites comes to mind.But apart from being cold and reflective, the novel possesses a great emotional power. It reminds us that there were many Germans who never supported the Nazis and they were the victims as well as everyone else. But we rare spare the thoughts for them. There is certainly the element of the universal truth in this for any war : we deserve all dignity for the winners. There were a few places in this novel that moved me close to tears, which is extremely rare for me. And the style of the narrative is sophisticated, but not for a single moment feels laboured.

It has been sitting next to this keyboard ever since. I haven't discussed it with friends. I haven't been tempted to share my thoughts in any way. That's about as tepid a 4-star assessment as possible.#1 of all #1s: completely disregard any blurbs to the effect of \"The interruption of this routine by an old schoolmate and former Nazi who has become a power in German reconstruction triggers a conflict both absorbing and profound.\" This blurb would have you believe that's \"just the beginning\" and that there's a lot of \"story\" that follows. Completely misleading. If possible, read the book having forgotten everything i wrote in the previous paragraph except for the part about ignoring blurbs.Embarrassing personal revelation #1: i horribly misread Chapter 4 in which the sometimes-focused-omniscient and sometimes-1st-person narrator's perspective becomes that of papa Faehmel (aka Heinrich, aka the architect, aka the self-\nmade\n man). I, however, continued to read as if in the mind of Robert, his surviving son (aka the robot, aka the destroyer, aka the \nruin\ned man), whose perspective held sway in Ch 3.Embarrassing personal revelation #2: Sadly, the point-of-view in Ch 5 befuddled me even more than Ch 4's. 1st page note: \"Took me forever to get that the perspective is Edith's\" (Robert's wife). Bottom of 3rd page i noted, \"3rd try {reading the first 3 pp} and still\u2014NOT Edith? Robert's {perspective, still}?\" Top of 4th page i wrote that maybe it's Heinrich \"but i must be misreading something.\" On the 8th page i thought it might be Robert's mom, \"in hospital (& demented)?\" And finally, funniest of all, at the top of the 9th page i wrote, \"Okay, no, the 'narrator' in this chapter is Johanna, Robert's wife\" {emphasis mine}. I was almost halfway through the novel and i still didn't know the names, family, relationships (Johanna is Robert's mother, in the hospital, and Heinrich's wife). Combine that with failing to catch that the narrative point of view shifted from Robert in Ch 3 to his father Heinrich in Ch 4, and you get an annoying confusion about the narrator in Ch 5. (Shame on me.)After identifying Ch 5's narrator, i finally figured out this scheisse (in which i am the scheissekopf) of changing narrators with little-to-no changes in voice.Therefore, (a) even though it's gotta be more fun to make these realizations for yourselves, (b) because it's much less fun to feel lost than it is to feel challenged (and that's what i was\u2014almost hopelessly lost), and (c) perhaps out of sympathy, i offer the following summary of narrators.Ch 1: Leonore, the family architectural firm's secretary gives her view of her boss and her boss's father on the day of the boss's father's 80th birthday. Ch 2: Strangely, told from the perspective of Jochen, an old desk clerk at the hotel where Faehmel the Younger plays billiards in strict privacy every day at the same time.Ch 3: At last, the mysterious boss Robert Faehmel going about his secret life. Ho-fugging-hum! Sorry, folks, it's nothing scandalous or interesting. He's a regular guy except that he's a nutter for sameness and consistency.Ch 4: Robert's father's life story. The book is \"set\" on his 80th birthday, so why not a little autobiography from a guy who almost literally created himself.Ch 5: Johanna, Robert's mother, narrates from inside the sanatorium leading up to and following a visit from her son and/or husband, but not during?Ch 6: Back to Robert.Ch 7: Pingponging between Schrella (Robert's childhood friend finally returned from exile) and Nettlinger (the alleged \"catalyst\" mentioned in the blurbs that you should ignore).Ch 8: Joseph, Robert's son, narrates\u2014an architect in training (his father & grandfather are also architects, but of very different stripes)\u2014as does his fianc\u00e9e Marianne.Ch 9: Schrella again.Ch 10: Robert again + his daughter Ruth.Ch 11: More from Johanna, this time she's \"talking to\" the general under whom her son served in World War II and narrating her plan for her husband's birthday party.Ch 12 & 13: Narrative orgy.Character & Plotishness Notes:Robert Faehmel is Mr. Rigid. He does the same thing at the same place at the same time every day. He's a lot like his dad Heinrich, actually. They're both architects. They both served in World Wars. They both lost (figuratively and/or literally) children & spouses to/during/as a result of those wars. Allegedly \"everything\" is thrown off balance because a couple characters from his past show up today on his father's 80th birthday. One of them is Schrella, a friend he's been hoping to see ever since the Nazi era. The other is one of his childhood/adolescence's tormentors who turned into a full-blown Nazi scumbag. Robert's mom is in the nuthouse (embarrassing personal revelation #3: i didn't notice/remember why, but all the blurbs i've read say she either tried to save some Jews being forced onto trains or she tried to get on). Joseph isn't sure if he wants to be an architect and coincidentally (today) discovers a dark family secret\u2014will he tell his father? his mother? his grandfather? anybody? Maybe he shouldn't go to the big birthday party for grampa tonight. Maybe nobody should. Gramma's gonna be there, though, and the rest of the family. Did i mention there also happens to be a political rally right outside the very hotel where Robert plays billiards every day on the very night that the Faehmels are having a pre-birthday party at the hotel? Imagine that!Other randumb thoughts:Though the novel takes place in one day, there are so many flashbacks that that assessment is overly simple. It's no Seinfeld episode, let's just put it that way.The billiards metaphor and the Naturalism color stuff (red green white white green red green red red white white green ... ad nauseam) didn't do nothin for me neither. I'll need to read what others had to say about it and rethink. And what's with this whole The Host of the Beast thing? It really annoyed me. In German, it's probably one really cool smooshedtogetherword, but the English phrase is clunky and annoying and its \"implication\" leads me to utter spontaneously \"Bah! Humbug!\" I finally bothered to look up the phrase and found this quote from Reading with Feeling that is ironically appropriate to my reaction. \"...communion, as well as background knowledge about a contrasting phrase also provided in the text, 'the lamb of God,' will likely affect how one responds to the phrase, 'the host of the beast,' and whether one responds to it at all\"! Author Susan L. Feagin goes on: \"These associations link the phrase 'the host of the beast' {*sigh*} with a sense of ritual, mystery, and horror, and its repetition encourages mantralike and mystical allusions that are reinforced every time the phrase is used.\" For me, exasperation is not ritualistic, mysterious, or horrifying. Maybe the reader must be a staunch Roman Catholic, or anybody else who's likely to revere The Host as being The Actual Christ. As a not-Lutheran, the metaphor is a dud.The translation. Strange. Felt very slangy, very 70s (guess it would be 60s cuz it was \u00a9 1962), especially at the beginning. Possibly limited almost exclusively to Jochen's voice as narrator/POV in Ch 2. That, too, put me off a bit. I didn't expect the language to be so time-bound. The perfect example from Jochen's chapter is \"I can tell if they're out for a shack job even before they step out of the taxi.\" OK, maybe that's not the perfect example because it's the working-class guy's inner monologue.I feel concerned about translations though when i come across inscrutable sentences such as, \"They had had none of the bravado of peace too long diked up.\" WTF is that supposed to mean, \"None of the bravado of peace had been diked up in them TOO LONG\"?! I honestly can't parse that sentence into something intelligible without ignoring some of its words. I won't doubt the integrity of the entire translation, but doubt crept in and made itself heard occasionally from there almost to the end.Maybe this book deserves another reading, but i doubt i ever will bother. Maybe it would touch me more upon rereading. Maybe i would finally feel the psychological damage of being a middle-aged (or older) German in the late 1940s, cuz i think that's what he's going for. The form pushed me away from it, though. Was that the point? Was he trying to shield me from his revelation? \"Psst, hey buddy, i have something incredibly important in this briefcase that you might wanna see,\" he says as he squirts me with mace & fits me with the world's darkest blue-blocker shades.CONCLUSION: i wasn't man enough to think myself big enough to give this book\u2014written by a Nobel laureate!\u2014\"only\" 3 stars at first. I still don't feel big enough, but i'm doing it anyway. I don't think you'll hate it, but i don't want to recommend it either.That was my original CONCLUSION, but then i leafed through the entire book looking for all my marginal notes and was reminded how redeemed everything felt by the end. I felt connected to the characters eventually. I could begin to wonder if i'd glimpsed a hint of why B\u00f6ll wrote this novel and why he wrote it this way. And now i'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, which is a crucial distinction for me, obviously. :-)I found in the last 25-33%(?) a semblance of understanding why these folks were so crazy and how B\u00f6ll's saying this craziness was caused by {*sigh*} The Host of the Beast's tainting of their entire society. I almost feel willing to say 4 stars but i just don't dig me no moralist/political fiction and i can't get past either of those aspects of this novel. Final verdict: guilty of 3 starsworthy novelty."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40870-mary", "userReview": "I almost missed an ultimately great experience with this book because the first pages did not seem to be repaying the effort.

It's impossible to approach his work today without this in mind, but back when his fourth novel, Billard um halb zehn was published, the topic of what it meant to be part of a postwar Germany hasn't been explored to the degree to which it has been reflected upon now and it made him one of the first authors to write about it. A Mosaic of MemoriesThis novel reads like a puzzle. It examines three generations of architects - the patriarch Heinrich F\u00e4hmel, who built St. Anthony's Abbey; his son Robert, who destroyed it at the end of WWII to protest the church's complicity with the Nazis and his grandson Joseph, who is now helping to restore it. While the story is set on one single day, it explores all of their responses to the Nazi regime and its aftermath through flashbacks and memories. It's confusing in a sense as the narrators and perspectives change without a warning throughout the narrative and the storytelling is so dense, that there were certain passages I had to re-read multiple times and unpick in my head to make sense of. To me, this is partly what makes this novel so appealing to me though, as I felt like it was slowly unraveling and that there was more to gain from it than the first layer of text might suggest. All the characters are shed light on from multiple angles, which allows a wholesome perspective that's satisfying and intriguing as a reader. Characters feel like people, like representations of something alive. I would argue that this overload of information and detail you receive is both a strength and a weakness - it makes it harder to pick up on the plot and the themes, and at the same time it conveys the feeling that probably arose in people growing up in that time in Germany - it is messy, tough to process and find your place in."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2530270-mike", "userReview": "The specter of fascism doesn't merely disappear when the threat is defeated. It lingers for generations, with much of the psychological effects becoming manifest only years after the violence has ended. Heinrich B\u00f6ll's novel is about three generations of German architects who struggle with the impact of two World Wars and Nazi oppression. Their friendships, families, and psyches are shattered, and the fragmented narrative of the novel reflects this reality, where memories are always ever-present, like the ruins of the city after the war. Grandfather Robert Faehmel has great dreams of building churches and having a large, robust family well into old age. He begins his career by designing an abbey that is the pride of the city. Unfortunately, the Nazis arrive as the \"Beast\" to destroy everything in their wake. Opposed to the nationalist thugs are the \"lambs\" of the novel: those who resist the Beast, but who are often slaughtered for their efforts. Robert's son, Richard, is described as a shepherd: he attempts to rescue as many lambs as possible, including his school friend Schrella. Richard is forced into the military even as he resists the Nazis.Despite being an architect himself, Richard doesn't build anything. Indeed, his big secret is that he was the one who blew up the very abbey his father designed on the orders of a foolish commander. The symbolism is clear (and heavy-handed at times): under the thumb of the Beast, an entire generation of Germans became sterile, unable to build upon the achievements of their parents, but only destroying, at the behest of the Nazis, the great civilization handed to them. Even though it was published in 1959, B\u00f6ll's novel is distinctly modernist, with each chapter written from the perspective of a different character. The simultaneity of inner and outer experiences, as well as the fractured temporality of the text, give the impression that the novel was written thirty years earlier--in other words, at the very time when many of the events of the novel take place in memory. The novel takes place in the late-50s, but the memories and flashbacks to the past are as clear as if they were happening in the present. Every building, person, and object reminds Robert and Richard of their past. Robert's son, Joseph, is also an architect. He discovers his father's secret and must come to terms with living in a world of ruins handed to him by the previous generation. We also encounter former-Nazis who are now politicians and government officials, many of whom are only moderately repentant.When a former Nazi runs for office on a staunch nationalist ticket, B\u00f6ll takes us down a road that is difficult to discuss: how far do we go to ensure that fascism doesn't return? Those who are most vulnerable, and who are driven almost to the point of madness, might take matters into their own hands and resort to violence to prevent the next rising of fascism. Is this acceptable? B\u00f6ll doesn't attempt to justify such violent recourse, but he does try to understand and explain it. I would call this a postmortem of Germany after the fall of the Third Reich during the ensuing years of the so-called Economic Miracle, but the entire point of the novel is that fascism wasn't dead. It was still alive, but in muted or distilled form. Those haunted by the specter of fascism passed on their problems to succeeding generations, and even attempts at a unifying healing will never erase the scars and ruins (both physical and psychosocial) that remain. B\u00f6ll's novel serves as a warning that when the menace is turned loose, no one escapes harm, whether lamb, shepherd, or beast."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1254714-steve", "userReview": "A very hard book to rate (and at times read), but in the end I felt that Billiards at Half-Past Nine promised, or suggested, more than it could ever deliver. I have no idea whether Boll had admired or read Faulkner, but \u201cBilliards,\u201d both structurally, with its constantly changing voices, and thematically (National Sin), certainly reminded me of Absalom, Abasalom. But Faulkner hit a home run with his novel (one the greatest in American Literature), and Boll, with his attempt to reconcile the past with the present, blinked. Nothing could better capture the difference than Faulkner\u2019s ending image of a rotting mansion, and Boll\u2019s abbey shaped like a cake. Boll\u2019s attempt to signal Hope doesn\u2019t seem yet earned. In fact, far from it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are soaring passages in Boll\u2019s novel that rival anything I\u2019ve read in literature. But he has set up some interesting and inhibiting filters, the primary one being German Catholicism, which operates culturally as well as religiously throughout the novel. Both are reflected in the multi-generation fortunes of the Faehmel family. Faith, death, suicide, Nazism, madness, and, well, architecture (Romanesque or Gothic?), it\u2019s all there. That said, the Faemels are generally good people who have had to negotiate through the dark historical waters of Germany\u2019s militaristic past. Boll throws his net wide, covering the pre-World War I period. Interestingly, the name Hitler (as far as I can recall) is never mentioned, and the Jews only once. Instead, it\u2019s Hindenburg, who is constantly referred to as the Beast. I\u2019m assuming Boll sees Hindenburg as the fatal, militaristic choice of many Germans. (Boll numbingly reminds us throughout the novel of those who took the Host of the Beast.) And Hindenburg, of course, opened the political path for Hitler. It\u2019s implicit, but perhaps too much so, given the shadows Hitler \u2013 and the Holocaust still cast."}, {"userName": "Rob Atkinson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5864643-rob-atkinson", "userReview": "This novel is one of the quintessential works of 20th C. German Literature, dealing as it does with the haunted legacy of Nazism, Germany's collective guilt in the post-war years, and the burden of memory, as reflected in the account of one German family, the Faehmels. Their history unfolds through the reminiscences of three generations, Grandfather, Father, and Son, all architects by trade; it eventually goes back as far as the old man's arrival in Cologne in 1907 and ends with the single, fateful day in September 1958 in which the novel is set, the same man's 80th birthday. Through each man's flashes of memory and varying viewpoints, we bear witness to the terrible price this one family paid for the strains of nationalism and militarism that defined the Kaiser's Germany and which reached their terrible climax in the rise of the Nazis. For the Faehmels, it is a legacy of young and agonizingly futile deaths, betrayals of friends and family, soul-crushing guilt and madness. Each of the men bear deep emotional scars from this legacy, it soon becomes clear; crucially, they are all now architects who no longer desire to build anything, a potent symbol of their loss of faith in mankind and the future. In some of the novel's most harrowing sections, the story's narration shifts to the institutionalized wife of the old man, who was finally driven mad by so much loss and pain during the course of WWII. That madness and its concommitant anger eventually finds its ultimate expression at the novel's climax, in a shocking act of reprisal. On another level, the novel is an indictment of indifferent complicity in the face of evil -- of those Germans who remained silent and aquiesced as their neighbors were brutalized, and particularly that of the Catholic Church in Germany, the dominant faith in the region in which the novel is set and of the story's protagonists, leading to their crisis of faith."}, {"userName": "Joselito Honestly and Brilliantly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190636-joselito-honestly-and-brilliantly", "userReview": "Three generations of Germans, two world wars, a lot of deaths, destruction and guilt in between. That's a good way of summarizing this book.Central character is Robert Faehmel. Strongly antiwar, hated the guts of Germany's militaristic leaders during both world wars yet, due to circumstances of self-preservation, became a commander of retreating German forces [mainly due to his expertise in blowing things up:] during the waning days of the second war and was responsible for the senseless demolition of an abbey which was built by his father and was the latter's top architectural achievement.The book's \"present time\" is in the late 50's although there are a lot of flashbacks and recollections, mostly of deaths in the family[Robert lost his wife and siblings during the war:]. Robert acts like a nut, runs a business but almost completely uncommunicative, cold and secretive. He follows an unbreakable daily routine, one of which is to ploay billiards in a hotel at exactly 9:30 am and ends it at 11:00 am.The author's style here is not for me, however. Unlike in most novels, there is no single narrator here. Sometimes it would be Robert narrating, in the first person, then there would be a sudden change of narrator to his father, then his crazy mother, then his secretary, his former classmate, etc. Yet they all sound the same [i.e., Boll:]. So the book demands complete attention from the reader.Maybe Boll just experimented with this difficult style in this novel.

I found it quite complex, and, like Cat and Mouse, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure I\u2019d got the point of what B\u00f6ll was trying to say. There are some obvious bits about regret and skeletons in the family closet, but those are pretty obviously going to be part of any German novel that looks at the world wars it began.There are characters who I\u2019d like to have seen fleshed out even more and their interaction made more of: Nettlinger, who attempts to confront Faehmel early on in the book, for example. And I wonder if it\u2019s a sign of the times that it was written in, when the scars of war were still suppurating in the German psyche, that the rise of Nazism and its adherents is not stated except in metaphorical terms.Instead, we\u2019re told of those who have \u201ctasted of the Buffalo Sacrament\u201d and those \u201cof the lamb.\u201d This duality sets the majority, the power holders and the oppressors against those who become their victims. While it\u2019s obvious that the former stand for the Nazis, by not stating this explicitly, B\u00f6ll is able to construct a novel whose characters could be any society in any era of history. In doing so, I think he is making a statement about how human society works, rather than just saying that the problems that gave rise to the Nazis were confined to one period in history. I think this is very wise.The novel is therefore important, both as a product of its time but also, more significantly, because B\u00f6ll is able to transcend this and write something that humanity should hear for centuries to come."}, {"userName": "Jeremy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859690-jeremy", "userReview": "\u201cWhy letters?\u201d Faehmel had said, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to collect confessions here, do we?\u201dAnd B\u00f6ll\u2019s story is a fantastic collection of different confessions from different people to different people, including themselves. It is stylistically both playful and challenging. Sometimes, you get the impression that the characters are standing on a stage, and the light goes on one of them, and they speak to themselves, or to the others; but the ones in the dark don\u2019t speak back, the one in the light speaks for them. It really carries a sense of sublime tragedy with it, experiencing people like this on the page.Narrative focus merges and entwines, and time is regularly played with, particularly around the lives of grandfather, father and son: Germans of the eras (chiefly) pre, during and post WW2. Motifs of the builder and the destroyer are used, but how the builder can be the one who destroys, and how the destroyer can be the one who builds, depending on what is being built up and why are explored. It\u2019s wrong to set formulae free from their rigidity, and put secrets into words, and transpose memeroy into feeling...The Church figures heavily, its role in a society, its use of doctrine, its overall sense of social enamel. Which is the sacrament they offer us, of the buffalo or of the lamb? There are fundamental ethical queries and suggestions apparent and a part of the most simple actions, and the most extraordinary. The development of the human being (or, soul, if you don\u2019t mind that word) through his or her interaction with everything that is-not-him, is-not-her\u2014what is partaken of.

From a pacifist family and having refused to join the Hitler Youth, B\u00f6ll was nonetheless conscripted and saw war both at its most gruesome and as one alienated from the unifying ideology. This novel which takes place on a day in 1958, looks at three generations (ages 20-80) of a family ravaged in a number of ways by the prior decades. The war itself is hardly touched - though there were many varyingly traumatic deaths, they take place off-screen. One of those was the sole brother who became a true believer (accepted \"the Host of the Beast\" in an oft-repeated phrase that places Nazism as a perversion of Catholicism), many of the others were \"disappeared\", there is some mental illness and so on.While the single day (with explanatory backward excursions via story-telling from older characters to younger and reminiscence), hints at classical unity, the specificity of the date (September 6th) has a Joycean quality. Another modernist touch (not really giving much away here), is a climactic scene where someone is shot (we're never quite sure who), the sound of which caps half a dozen separate scenes covering the prior hour (enumerated to the minute by various devices) as the whole cast of characters is spread around a couple of adjacent buildings in the unnamed city."}, {"userName": "Amir", "userReviewDate":

Het boek leest als een stroom waarin je je moet laten meeslepen/meesleuren. Een stroom waarbij je constant wisselt tussen personages en tijdstippen. Want ja, een mooi boek is dit zeker.En toch heb ik met twee dingen moeite:- Dit boek is ontzettend lastig om te lezen. Ik ga een uitdagend boek niet uit de weg, maar op het einde moet ik wel het gevoel hebben dat het de moeite waard geweest is. Hier had ik het gevoel: \"OK, ik snap nu het verhaal en hoe de band tussen de personages ineen zit, nu zou ik het eigenlijk eens opnieuw moeten lezen.\" Zo heb ik mijn boeken niet graag: op het einde moeten ze af zijn. Nog eens herlezen om kleine details op te vangen: OK. Nog eens herlezen om het echt deftig te kunnen lezen: dat gaat te ver.- Heinrich B\u00f6ll schrijft vanuit het standpunt van veel personages. Het is vaak gissen wie er nu aan het woord is, soms had ik het maar tegen de helft van het hoofdstuk door. Het is allemaal literair mooi, maar B\u00f6ll geeft de personages geen eigen stem, ze praten en denken allemaal hetzelfde (op de hotelbediende na misschien). En eigenlijk vind ik dat een goed schrijver dat wel moet kunnen. Sorry Heinrich.

Schon damals war ich von der Sprache hingerissen - flie\u00dfend, wie ein Gedicht, schmerzend, wie eine Beichte, unendliche Passagen, die einen in die Wirbel der Zeit hineinsaugen. Es ist eine Geschichte \u00fcber Menschen, die mit der Zeit in der sie lebten keine Vers\u00f6hnung finden, Menschen, die ohne viel zu bereden und Fragen zu stellen, einfach weiterleben und deren innigen Gewissensstimme gehorchen. Das Ganze wird nicht allein mit Augen gelesen, sondern l\u00e4sst sich einatmen, wie Tausende D\u00fcfte einer alten Stadt, wie ein frischer Luftzug vom Flussufer, es zieht einen hinein und schickt auf eine endlose Reise der Erinnerungen. Ich w\u00fcsste nur zu gern, wie breit dieses Meer aus Erinnerungen sei, wie viele namenlose, vergessene Stimmen rufen aus der Tiefe, wie viele verborgene Inseln muss man ansteuern bevor man behaupten k\u00f6nnte, man w\u00fcrde seine Mitmenschen kennen."}, {"userName": "Atena", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7425593-atena", "userReview": "\u0628\u06cc \u062c\u0647\u062a \u0646\u0628\u0627\u06cc\u062f\u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u0631\u0627\u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u062c\u0645\u062f\u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0647 \u0630\u0648\u0628 \u0634\u062f\u0646 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u060c\u062f\u0631 \u0622\u0646 \u0635\u0648\u0631\u062a \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062a\u06a9\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u06cc\u062e \u062a\u0628\u062f\u06cc\u0644 \u0628\u0647 \u0622\u0628 \u06a9\u062b\u06cc\u0641 \u0648\u0644\u0632\u062c\u06cc \u0645\u06cc \u0634\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u0645\u06cc \u0686\u06a9\u062f. \u0647\u06cc\u0686 \u0686\u06cc\u0632 \u0631\u0627 \u0646\u0628\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0632\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u060c\u0627\u0632 \u0630\u0647\u0646 \u0646\u0631\u0645 \u0648 \u0646\u0627\u0632\u06a9 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u06cc \u0622\u062f\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u063a \u0646\u0628\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u062a \u0648 \u062d\u062f\u062a \u0627\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0633\u0627\u062a \u06a9\u0648\u062f\u06a9\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0648\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u062d\u06cc\u0627 \u06a9\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0628\u0647 \u062a\u062c\u0631\u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0648\u0631\u062f\u060c \u0648 \u0645\u062b\u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0628\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u06cc\u0627\u062f \u0622\u0648\u0631\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0648 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0686\u06cc\u0632\u06cc \u0647\u0645 \u0645\u06cc \u06af\u06cc\u0631\u062f\u060c\u0627\u062d\u062a\u06cc\u0627\u0637! \u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0646\u0628\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627\u062e\u062a.\u0647\u06cc\u0686 \u062e\u0648\u0628 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0622\u062f\u0645 \u0641\u0631\u0645\u0648\u0644 \u0647\u0627 \u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0632 \u0642\u06cc\u062f \u0627\u0646\u062c\u0645\u0627\u062f \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u060c \u0631\u0627\u0632\u0647\u0627 \u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0642\u0627\u0644\u0628 \u06a9\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0632\u062f.\u062a\u0628\u062f\u06cc\u0644 \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u0639\u0627\u0637\u0641\u0647 \u0648 \u0627\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0633 \u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u0641\u06cc\u062f\u06cc \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u060c \u0639\u0627\u0637\u0641\u0647 \u0646\u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0686\u06cc\u0632\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0628\u06cc \u0648 \u06a9\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0628\u06cc \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0639\u0634\u0642 \u0648 \u0646\u0641\u0631\u062a \u0631\u0627 \u0646\u0627\u0628\u0648\u062f \u06a9\u0646\u062f.\u067e\u06cc\u0631\u0645\u0631\u062f\u060c\u0633\u0627\u06a9\u062a! \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631 \u06af\u0631\u06cc\u0647 \u0646\u06a9\u0646. \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0634 \u062f\u0631 \u06cc\u06a9 \u062c\u0644\u0627\u06cc \u0648\u0637\u0646 \u062f\u0631\u0648\u0646\u06cc\u060c\u06cc\u06a9 \u067e\u0646\u0627\u0647\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u062f\u0645 \u0633\u0631\u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0645.."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew", "userReview": "This is one of my first forays (and perhaps, come to think of it, my very first) into postwar German literature. Through use of flashbacks, B\u00f6ll sets up this very retrospective but entirely non-nostalgic sensibility, using a time of peace and prosperity as a highly effective counterpoint to a time of war and political extremism. Throughout, B\u00f6ll utilizes a cool, languid tone.
