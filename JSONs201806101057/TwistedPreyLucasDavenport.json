Where he shines is in getting the details exactly right. Lots of dry humor here, especially when it comes to DC and politics. There\u2019s a wonderful sense of tension throughout. Even though Davenport knows who\u2019s behind the foul play, that doesn\u2019t mean he can prove it for a court of law. Watching him put the pieces of the puzzle together kept me riveted. You can see the ending coming, but it was the perfect ending. I have to give Sandford credit. It\u2019s wild to imagine this is the 28th book in the series. If anything, he\u2019s getting better.

This was a very enjoyable read. Lucas is asked to investigate the attempted assassination of a U. S. Senator, and he calls on Bob and Rae for assistance. Along with local law enforcement and the FBI, the U. S. Marshals follow leads and try to put together a case. There are several deaths as the investigation is thwarted time and time again.Both Virgil (of \u201cthat fuckin' Flowers\u201d fame) and Kidd make minor appearances in this book. Good to know they are both well, and it seems Virgil is still headed toward domestication. You\u2019ll know what I mean if you\u2019ve read Sandford's Virgil Flowers series. Lucas's wife, Weather, and their daughter, Letty, have small roles as well.As is usual in John Sandford's books, the dialogue feels natural with lots of ribbing and humor. Lucas is a clotheshorse, and some downtime allows him to visit a tailor with Bob. I enjoy those little side stories. There is cooperation between all agencies involved, meaning they share information, so the case moves along to a satisfying conclusion."}, {"userName": "Monnie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6277675-monnie", "userReview": "Can this possibly be the 28th book in the Prey series? I know I haven't missed many, so guess that makes me an oldie (but goodie). And so is the series; even if \"star\" character Lucas Davenport, now a federal marshal, seems to be a bit more laid back these days, there's plenty of action here that kept me reading until my Kindle battery insisted it needed a recharge.Happily - and in one case, unhappily - a few other characters make return appearances in this one. There's Weather, Lucas's surgeon wife, Letty, his daughter, some former professional colleagues and the even more lovable (to me, at least) Virgil Flowers, upon whom Mr. Sandford has bestowed a series all his own.Still another blast from the past is Taryn Grant, a psychopath who's now a U.S. Senator. Lucas is certain she's up to her old tricks (and being a billionaire, she's able to grease wheels till the Minnesota cows come home). One of her other enemies, Sen. Porter Smalls, knows firsthand how dangerous the woman is. In fact, he's convinced that a recent auto accident that nearly killed him - and did kill the driver - was all her doing. Proving that, though, just isn't in his skill set.So, he calls in Lucas - who turns to local law enforcement, the FBI and others to help with the investigation. All heck breaks loose in the process, with suspicions turning into twists and turns that threaten the well-being of everyone involved, including Lucas's own family. And in the end, getting to the truth doesn't necessarily mean justice will be done. Or does it?Many thanks to the publisher, via NetGalley, for the opportunity to read and review an advance copy."}, {"userName": "Maureen Carden", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54932249-maureen-carden", "userReview": "The psychopathic Minnesota Senator Taryn Grant and U.S. Marshall Lucas Davenport have faced off before in a murderous duel in the book Silken Prey. The best one can say is that is was a draw between the two.But now Grant is becoming more powerful and is eyeing the White House. Holding on to her coattails, I mean skirts, are members of a private and lethal military contracting company. Fortunately, they aren\u2019t completely successful in their assignment to eliminate another senator but they draw the attention of Davenport. Always a big mistake. With whip smart dialogue, returning characters and a logical but a twisting plot, the fast moving Twisted Prey is a pleasure to read. A pleasure, but I have a few problems.I also found it annoying that Flowers and Kidd would show up for very minor appearances. A couple of paragraphs? Really? Why bother?I\u2019m also confused about all of the Marshals in this book. U.S.Marshals are politically appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. There are very few of them. Most people who work for the Marshal\u2019s service are Deputy U.S. Marshals. In theory Davenport could be a Marshall, but I doubt the rest of the Marshals that show up are actually Marshals, more like Deputy Marshals. Stuff like this really bothers me in a book.I don't understand why if the first person they plan to arrest is killed that they wouldn\u2019t go eyes on with their next subjects. Oh come on, that\u2019s not a spoiler, its obvious early on that he is a red shirt.If y\u2019all think I am being a bit bitchy about minor plot holes, think about this being book 28. This is a hugely popular series for very good reasons. Carelessness makes no sense.Set mostly in the Washington DC area, Sandford amusingly portrays the disdain that most hold for the area. He managed to get in some terrific shots at the current political climate too.Everyone is fair game in this book.

Another Prey book that I started one day and finished the next, finding it very easy to want to pick up where I left off and harder still to put down. I found the 'S' sink thing a bit far fetched, but at the end of the day I don't really give a crap. I was so happy to see more of Rae and Bob. I really worried about having Davenport in the middle of politics, not that Sandford has ever been quiet in that regards, but having Davenport as a US Marshal just seemed to be pushing it a bit far, however, although it's clear that politics play a part in these novels, in Sandford's minds and yes, in Davenport's mind, it's still clear that at the end of the day Lucas doesn't really care about much except the adrenaline rush he gets from winning against these 'bad' guys and girls. Lucas seems to have cooled his hot head a bit in his older years and doesn't quite act so rashly...or maybe I should say, he's gained enough patience to think through his plans and the long term consequences. He also seems more and more willing to manipulate others to see that justice is served as it should be at the end of the day. In the past, he would have just flown off the handle and cleaned up best he could afterwards. Now he lines up the players and patiently sits back until justice is done.As always, the dialogue is there, the action is there, and my love for Sandford is ALWAYS there...ARC provided by Netgallery for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24668886-scott", "userReview": "To begin with, I think it is only appropriate that I admit to being a fairly avid reader of John Sandford, especially a fan of his Lucas Davenport \u201cPrey\u201d series. A pretty big fan to be honest. However, I am coming off the last book, \u201cGolden Prey\u201d with a bit of disdain and disappointment. The plotting was one of his weaker ones and the last hundred pages was an overly drawn out, anti-climactic ending. Because of that I have been worried about how this one was going to turn out. Turns out I was wrong. What a difference a year makes\u2026When we last saw our fearless hero, Lucas Davenport, he was getting comfortable in his federal marshal job which afforded him lots of freedom in cases he investigates. He had two agents assigned to him \u2013 Bob and Rae - both of whom are witty, hard-working and never lack an opinion. When this book begins, we see the return of Taryn Grant, the rich and power-hungry psychopath that previously beat out Porter Smalls for his U.S. Senate seat using murder to help her achieve her lofty goals a few years ago back in \u201cSilken Prey\u201d (book 23). Grant is beautiful, intriguing, and downright pure evil.Davenport is still angry over not being able to prove her responsibility in at least three murders back home in Minnesota and his opportunity for a second chance has arrived. Grant has found herself a seat on the Senate Intelligence Committee and is using it to seek the higher position in the land \u2013 the presidency. Lucas finds himself having to balance his own selfish desires when he is asked to investigate the claim that she is trying to eliminate those in her way. This time, Lucas is determined to settle his unfinished business with Grant, one way or another. This was the enjoyable read that I was hoping it would be. The plotting had more energy, tension, and risk for our hero. Unlike the last book, we get to see more of the family members and team mates that are a key part of Davenport\u2019s life. In some ways, some appearances are for the wrong reasons, but that adds to the strong challenges that Lucas faces in this increased emotional plot line. We see Davenport\u2019s wife, Weather. His outspoken daughter, Letty. We even get to see Kidd, the computer hacking wizard in action, as well as that awesome freaking Virgil Flowers. I missed them the last time out.The first third of the book is spent setting up the chess pieces on the game board and stirring the pot to get the action bubbling. Then when things just start to settle in \u2013 WHAM \u2013 the plot completely turns on an emotional game changing twist that boils over. What a twist! I found myself caught off guard but completely impressed by Sandford\u2019s wicked manipulation of his reader\u2019s emotions. No spoilers will be shared here other than to say there are \u201cclassic\u201d Davenport moments in this outing that will not be forgotten for a long time. Sandford is definitely dipping into the emotional bank account this time around. And it paid off handsomely. In some ways that I did see coming and in some ways that didn\u2019t see anticipate. There is a character introduced in this book that has multiple names, none of which may even be the real one, that develops an interesting relationship with Lucas and serves as a wildcard in in one of the outcomes. I definitely want to see her again in a future outing and I am sure there\u2019s a lot more we can learn about her own background and story. Overall, this book was the great summer-time read that Stephen King talks about in his cover blurbs promoting John Sandford\u2019s Lucas Davenport series. It was much better plotted and tension-filled than the last one where less feared bad guys provided a much weaker climax. Taryn Grant serves as a stronger adversary that challenges Davenport on a much more analytical and emotional level. There is no one around him she is not afraid to go after, whether it be professional relationships or personal ones. In my humble opinion, with \u201cTwisted Prey\u201d John Sandford has regained his writing groove and Lucas Davenport has rediscovered his detective mojo. He is the true law enforcement rebel with a badge and a cause. Unlike last year at this time, I cannot wait to read Davenport\u2019s next adventure. If you haven\u2019t tried reading him, pick up the first book and get started\u2026"}, {"userName": "Skip", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1389748-skip", "userReview": "Back when he was still at the Minnesota BCA, Lucas Davenport tangled with sociopath Taryn Grant, who while running for the Senate, framed her rival (Porter Smalls) for child pornography and killed a few people to cover it up.

Senator Smalls is coming back from his cabin with a female political supporter/girlfriend when a pickup runs them off the road, killing her. When the police cannot find evidence of another vehicle, Smalls asks Lucas Davenport to investigate, and his superiors agree to the Senator's request.

This twenty-eighth installment in the Lucas Davenport series takes place in Washington, DC and pits US Marshall Lucas Davenport against a formidable foe who rather ruthlessly attempts to eliminate her opposition on her climb up the political ladder.Following an attempt on his life that leaves one person dead, Minnesota Senator Porter Smalls does not hesitate to reach out to Lucas Davenport for help. Smalls is convinced his former rival and current Senator Taryn Grant is behind the plot to take him out and he knows that Lucas is more than up to the task of proving it. For his part, Davenport would love nothing than another crack at Grant who once before turned to murder and nasty shenanigans to clinch her Senate seat. Quickly traveling to Washington, DC, Lucas, aided by fellow Marshalls, Rae Givens and Bob Matees, works hard to prove Grant and her merry band of henchman are behind the attempt on Smalls' life.Taryn's Chief of Staff Jack Parrish is the first person who falls under Davenport's scrutiny. A former Army officer and CIA operative, he is the obvious person for Grant to use for her dirty work. He, in turn, has some rather surprising ties to a defense contractor, Heracles Personnel, which is run by George Claxson. The discovery that Claxson has several former military members and mercenaries on his payroll raises eyebrows, but this does not necessarily mean they are involved in anything illegal.Lucas quickly ferrets out some dubious defense contracts that lead right back to Heracles. He also locates the person whom he believes was involved in Smalls' car \"accident\" and he must work quickly to get the authorities on board with his theory before evidence is lost or destroyed. Just as he, Rae and Bob are closing in on the person they hope will flip on key players, \u00a0the suspects put in motion a devious plan to divert Lucas's attention. \u00a0Taryn and her crew continue to be one step ahead of him and although he, Rae and Bob make considerable progress on the case, Lucas fears she will once again slip through his fingers.Twisted Prey is an intricately-plotted and riveting mystery. The storyline is quite clever and well-executed.\u00a0 John Sandford keeps the long running Lucas Davenport series fresh by changing up Lucas's career and adding new faces to the cast. This newest release features a topical storyline, a particularly loathsome cast of despicable criminals and an interesting investigation that takes all of Lucas's skills to solve.\u00a0 Will Lucas finally make a case against the vile and abhorrent Taryn Grant?

Taryn Grant, who is the Senator from a previous Prey book, is who Smalls suspects, and whom Lucas agrees would be a likely suspect based on her past ruthless behavior.Lucas has been a U.S. Marshall for some time now, and characters from his past like Jenkins and Shrake have been replaced by Bob and Ray, partners who enthusiastically work with him on the case after the boredom of their recent assignments leaves them hungry for action.One of the aspects that I like about the Prey books is how Lucas uses all the resources available to him, whether local authorities or FBI specialists, he\u2019s always used unconventional and creative ways to piece together the clues discovered in a way that leads to the killer(s) responsible in the cases.Sandford has aged Lucas nicely, and the series has taken a shift from the high action and chase predominance of his earlier novels to a more focused investigative approach that fits with Lucas getting older and wiser, and as always a little bit of luck enters into solving the case.I liked this one as it got better the further the story progressed, something I\u2019ve found true of my favorite books in the series, and once again I\u2019m amazed at how many quality books author Sandford has written in this series with Lucas keeping his edge over the years in a way that makes him feared and respected by both colleagues and the criminal element alike.4 stars."}, {"userName": "Jessica Bronder", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5781282-jessica-bronder", "userReview": "Lucas Davenport is back and working as a US Marshall.

Of course Davenport is eager to prove this and starts calling in people to help him. But that is where things go sideways. Grant is not going to give Davenport the chance to prove he tried to kill Smalls and is willing to go to any length to stop him.This is a great story that is filled with lots of action, plenty of thrills, and a great story that twists and turns around itself and keeps you guessing about what is really going on.

I know it bothered Lucas that he knew what happened in the past, but couldn't prove it, allowing the bad guy to go free. With that knowledge you knew that Lucas wasn't about to let that happen again. Lucas and his crew slowly started to unravel things, each lead found something bigger. Soon it seems like so much was going on, so many alphabet groups were in on things, so much bigger than the original crime of a car being run off the road.Towards the end it seemed to me that Lucas wasn't going to get his bad guy himself, but he might be letting someone else do the work for him. It was only on the last page that I realized I was right and more than just me knew it."}, {"userName": "Mehmet Utkan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49076619-mehmet-utkan", "userReview": "Satellite noise.

He brings back characters from previous novels, both good guys and bad guy. Asked by Porter Small, senator from Minnesota, to investigate an attempt on his life, Davenport gets involved with the operators from a company that supplies private military contractors. From there Davenport brings in the FBI when he finds evidence of illegal weapons shipments by that contractor. All in all a pretty good read.

I absolutely loved last year's Golden Prey and had my fingers crossed that Twisted Prey would at least come close in quality. It exceeded my expectations. Lucas Davenport is one of my favorite characters. Sandford surrounds him with an entertaining cast of supporting characters. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, along with heart pounding tension. I won't say more for fear of spoilers, but Lucas is at his best when he rides the line of legality. He's a sneaky bastard and Twisted Prey was an awesome ride."}], "description": "Lucas Davenport confronts an old nemesis, now more powerful than ever as a U.S. senator, in the thrilling new novel in the #1 New York Times-bestselling Prey seriesLucas Davenport had crossed paths with her before.A rich psychopath, Taryn Grant had run successfully for the U.S. Senate, where Lucas had predicted she'd fit right in. He was also convinced that she'd been responsible for three murders, though he'd never been able to prove it. Once a psychopath had gotten that kind of rush, though, he or she often needed another fix, so he figured he might be seeing her again.He was right. A federal marshal now, with a very wide scope of investigation, he's heard rumors that Grant has found her seat on the Senate intelligence committee, and the contacts she's made from it, to be very...useful. Pinning those rumors down was likely to be just as difficult as before, and considerably more dangerous.But they had unfinished business, he and Grant. One way or the other, he was going to see it through to the end.", "title": "Twisted Prey\n      \n          (Lucas Davenport #28)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36530636-twisted-prey", "average": 4.5, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1523715832l/36530636.jpg", "reviews": 565, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4610.John_Sandford", "name": "John Sandford"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Thriller", "Fiction", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36530636-twisted-prey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36140457-twisted-prey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39848330-twisted-prey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36168749-twisted-prey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37301.Rules_of_Prey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37304.Winter_Prey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9440448-buried-prey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14785.Chosen_Prey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/988950.Dark_of_the_Moon"]}
