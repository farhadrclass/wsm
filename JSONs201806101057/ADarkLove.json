Waving goodbye to her husband, renown psychoanalyst Dr. Porter Moross, Caroline quickly disappears into bustling D.C. and hops onto a bus bound for the West. Hoping for a new start, like the pioneers of old, Caroline adopts the alias of Alice and prays that her husband will never find her in the quiet mountain town she's heading to. But she knows, as the days go by that he's coming for her, and this time only one of them is walking off that mountaintop alive. ******spoilers*******Begin RantOh. My. God. I've never been so happy to finish a book. Ugh. I curse my OCD. And ultimately, I've only got myself to blame because I knew it when I flipped to the back of this book at the bookstore. I knew when I spotted the HFN ending that this book wasn't going to be good for me. I knew it! *slaps self* But I was hoping for an exciting, tense thriller a la Karen Rose. Or something. Ha! Not even close. This book was soulsucking on so many levels. Margaret Carroll lost me by the first page. She starts it off with Caroline's escape - in minute detail. Step by agonizingly slow step. Caroline makes her escape, buys hair dye, dyes her hair, gets on a bus, talks to an older woman, gets off the bus, walks to town, blah, blah, blah. You get my drift. Unfortunately all the above took like half the book to get to. Why? Because Margaret Carroll insisted on showing Porter's oh, excuse me, DR. Moross's point of view after every other chapter. This was of course, wedged in between the ten other BS character's rotating points of view. I can't even begin to describe how unbelievably frustrating I found this book to be. I couldn't even call Caroline/Alice, Dr. Moross and Ken Kincaid the main characters of this book. This was more play-like, with everyone given equal billing and stage time. Everyone a cast of supporting characters. And maybe from a purely fiction-standpoint that would fly, but not in a book stuck in the romance section. And even from a fiction standpoint this book wouldn't fly because it's so slow and boring. But boringness aside, my main gripe was with, for argument's sake, the main characters, Caroline/Alice and Porter. They were unbelievably pathetic. I couldn't even call Porter the villain in this book. To do so would give him too much credit. And how the holy heck did he manage to reel Caroline in during the beginning of their cruel, symbiotic relationship? He's described as an albino? with oozing purple pustules on his face. *Sorry if that makes me the cruel, pretty cheerleader who is symbolically stepping aside so that the popular jocks can beat him up, but you know, sometimes the popular kids get it right. This mama's boy lost his soul a long time ago and those jocks probably sensed that.* But worst of all, he's mean and cutting to her during their first date. She can't even use the excuse that he started off as Prince Charming. How did this happen then, you say? Easy to explain. Because she's more pathetic than he is. She was a woman who seemed to understand his need to hurt her and she accepted it. Slowly spiraling down into the classic battered-spouse syndrome. Which didn't add up. If Caroline was capable of sending emails to a past college lover, complaining of Porter's treatment of her, then she wasn't as far gone as she let on. She hadn't hidden within that insular wall that abused women hide behind that allows them to show the world that everything is, \"fine.\" Instead it led me to believe that she rolled over like a worm of a dog and took it. Sorry if this makes me sound heartless and a non supporter of abused women, but in all honesty, I blame the author. She was lousy at creating sympathetic characters. And equally lousy at creating a believable villain. Porter was for the most part, lost in his own psychosis and spent a lot of time crying til snot ran down his face. It didn't make him less dangerous. The contents of his trunk was sufficient in letting me know what he was capable of. But it did make him less scary. Because instead of the fear of the unknown, he was predictable and controllable. You know he was coming after her in a great show of sound and fury but you also knew that all it would take was a harsh word, or a good, hard kick to send this little worm scurrying into the arms of the first lactating hooker he could find and into the first Infantilism fetish club that would take him. Now onto the romance portion of this book. Which was lousy. She's only been away from Porter for a few days and she's already getting horny for the first hot guy she sees. Whatever. Again, this brings me back to that missing feeling of her battered spouse syndrome. Which allows me to feel that some of the things she suffered from makes her bear a certain amount of culpability. But whatever. I ranted about that already. Now I'm ranting about the romance portion of this book. *sigh* Ken Kincaid should have been a wonderful character. I loved the way he was described. A great big teddy bear of a man. Unfortunately he's not given enough to shine in this book, which is understandable since he's barely around. He's never on alpha male alert status either, desperate to protect his mate. He's relaxed, at ease, and he moves slowly because he instinctively knew that he had to do so around Caroline/Alice. He was just \"nice\" and \"there\" and was someone who unfortunately got caught up in the cruelty of the Moross marriage. There is zero amount of sex or sexual acts in this book, except for a weird, very quick, S&M flashback meant to show how degrading the Moross marriage had become, and the H/H never say I love you, nor do they even hug or kiss. So what am I left with, when I hate both the main characters? A lousy attempt at a romantic thriller that leaves me feeling angry at myself for feeling heartless and cruel towards said characters. Even at the end, when Caroline is sad and hurt as she watches the people around her watch her with looks of revulsion and pity on their face, I couldn't deny that I was one of those people judging her. And I could have been a lot harsher with my thoughts, too. Would I attempt a Margaret Caroll book again? Eh. Who knows. I do know that right now I think her writing needs a lot of work. No time was spent on finding out what went wrong with Caroline during her childhood and though Porter spends a lot of time whining about his mom, not a lot is told about what went wrong there either. She gave way too much information at certain times, then not enough at other times, and left several storylines up in the air. She conveyed no urgency or exciting, pulse pounding adrenaline rushes in her writing. Her transitions from the past to the present were not clearly defined. I spent one too many times going, \"huh?\" Plus, she was longwinded to the extreme. *Much like this review. But hey, when you're passionate, you're passionate.* If she was looking to create different characters in non-likable scenarios with no real right or wrong, then thats fine. But she needs to back it up with superb writing. I do see some potential in her future work, just none in this book. So, all in all, I am very disappointed. But maybe someone who does not primarily read romance novels may like this book better. *shrug* End Rant"}, {"userName": "Miss Kim", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/925549-miss-kim", "userReview": "The theme is one that I usually enjoy\u2014the abused heroine escapes from her psycho husband and finds love with a great guy. This starts out good. Caroline is literally walking away from her life, carrying only four grand cash, and her tiny dog. It opens with her husband, Porter, watching her walk down the street and we know she has only his allotted 20 minutes (the time she must return from walking her dog) before he starts to suspect something. It takes a while for her to get to where she is going\u2014a small town across the country. The husband immediately knows she is gone after her being like two minutes late and he starts to melt down. He\u2019s retracing her steps, searching the house, hacking into her emails, etc. He finds out she\u2019s been corresponding with a male friend from college for the past two years. There is flirty banter, and this enrages Porter. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cok, here we go\u2026this is good\u2026\u201d, but then it falls flat. Porter prints off all the emails between the man and Caroline and mails them to the man\u2019s wife. Then\u2026nothing. The guy is barley mentioned again, let alone get his wife\u2019s response to the package.We don\u2019t get much background on the marriage or why she thought he was so great. He sounded like a pompous ass right away. The description of him is ghastly. He has long white hair and a beard, and purple oozing scabies all over his face. Gross!!!! Some controlling man that doesn\u2019t even have good looks to make up for his personality makes no sense at all.She finally gets to the town and decides \u2018yes I love it. I\u2019m never leaving\u2019. She meets the love interest, Ken, almost immediately. He could have been cool. However, he was just always a smiling, understanding, hot-guy-that-can have-anyone, ex football star, that really had nothing to say. He didn\u2019t really do anything. I didn\u2019t buy that he sees this woman and falls for her instantly\u2014like he just knew she was his destiny and he\u2019d been waiting for her for years. Weird. I could see her thinking he is good looking, but if she\u2019s been in an abusive marriage for years and also had a horrible childhood that consists of rape by the stepfather, then I can\u2019t see her so eager to jump into something with Ken within a day. They hardly have any scenes together, and we get a few chaste kisses. No sex between them at all. However, there is a disturbing flashback with the husband and her that didn\u2019t seem to fit. Usually you get that, and then the woman gets to find out what it is like to have loving intimacy. The husband keeps bringing up that she loved being raped by her stepfather, but we get no back ground about that all. How did she get out of that situation? Where is her mother? By \u00bd ways through, I realized I bought a stinker. I was disappointed, and but couldn\u2019t stop reading it. I had to know the ending. It was lame. It is complete with the H&H escaping an explosion, and the psycho having \u2018mommy\u2019 issues--so badly that he has mom stored in a drum in a storage facility. That seemed to be thrown in there. Ok. What did his mother do to him? How did he kill her? Why? No resolution.It seemed the author was trying to make this man seem so scary that she threw all the standard psycho stuff at him and hoped they\u2019d all stick. It was just silly to me."}, {"userName": "Pamela(AllHoney)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/884792-pamela-allhoney", "userReview": "First I want to say I really did like this story a lot but I couldn't justify a 3 stars due to certain issues. The story was easy to read and not bogged down with a lot of details and that is one of the issues I had. Not enough details. There were also certain unresolved issues that should have been addressed but weren't. Some scenes lacked so much detail that I assume the author was relying on the reader's imagination and that can be good but didn't really work for the most part. The romance portion was rated G and that is fine for me. I don't HAVE to have steam but I did feel it lacked some character development and details, of course. I will watch for more by this author, however, because I feel she has a lot of potential."}, {"userName": "Daisy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8183788-daisy", "userReview": "Very good book, keeps you in suspense the entire time.

It's yet another riff on Sleeping With The Enemy, but it's a fairly efficient thriller that kept me engaged from beginning to end.However, I couldn't connect with Caroline and how she wound up married to this freak! I spent several years working as a Restraining Order clerk and learning from victim support workers how otherwise smart women are wooed into these terrible situations, as the abuser starts off as Prince Charming before slowly cutting off the channels for help, and how that pattern keeps repeating. I understand every situation is different (especially if drug addiction is involved), but here it's just bizarre! Porter is an albino with purple pustules lining his face. He behaves atrociously during his first dates with Caroline. He tells her off for being late. He acts like a child and refuses to talk to her. He cries at random moments and keeps putting her down! He doesn't do a single thing that would convince any sane woman to overlook any negative points. Caroline just wants to \"fix\" him! Seriously?!?Not every abuser is hiding behind a handsome exterior, obviously, but the author is trying to paint Caroline as a smart woman who probably would, in real life, run for the hills moments into the first date!"}, {"userName": "Emma Hillman", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2767533-emma-hillman", "userReview": "I had to force myself to finish this book. I usually like this theme and the latest one I read was amazing (I think it was from Lisa Kleypas?) but A Dark Love just didn't do it for me.I didn't believe in the romance because 1. they'd only met a week before and 2. she was still married but apparently that didn't matter. Some of the villain's scene were downright disgusting and I found myself speed-reading through them.So I finished it but I can't say I enjoyed it. If the romance hadn't happened so fast, like say give them six months or so...if there hadn't been discrepancies (like the fact she was flirting via email with an old friend when she was supposed to be under her husband's total control), maybe I'd have liked it more.

A Dark Love is a fast moving thriller with great characters, great pacing, and one of the most demented villains you'll come across. I know everyone loves to cheer for the protagonist, but here, watching the bad--really bad--guy devolve into madness is riveting. Do you know where the book is going? Well yes, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. Don't let the cover fool you. If you're looking for a romance, go elsewhere. A Dark Love does have romance, but that's not what drive this story.

One afternoon, Caroline takes her small white Yorkshire terrier, and leaves. She boards a Greyhound bus and leaves for parts unknown, ending up in a small Colorado town. In two short weeks, she begins to fit right in with the sweet small town, even falling a little bit in love with a former Kansas City Chiefs NFL player. Yet all is not well. Her psychotically controlling, abusive husband hunts her down. He attempts to kill both Caroline and her paramour, and ends up killing himself. Caroline and the football player end up together.That\u2019s the basic outline. The book does provide suspense. It is a pretty standard woman-in-jeopardy storyline, but it is told in a pacey way, with enough complexity to make the outcome both obvious (the woman will win) while withholding enough information so you\u2019re not sure how it resolve. I did not once skim or skip ahead. I really did absorb every word.There were some problems, however. The first is, the crazy abusive husband had these weird unspecified mommy issues. Like, he called for his mommy without explaining what that was about. Also he had a kind of random way of being a barbarian to his wife. He would beat her with a riding crop while making her recite childhood sexual abuse at her step-father\u2019s hand. I felt like if you\u2019re going to use such serious issues, they deserved a little more depth. But they were mentioned in passing, as if they meant nothing.On a purely technical level there were several issues. The author mentioned a \u201cPorsche 988.\u201d There is no such car. It would have been easy to Google and find a real car to use. This sort of tiny issue explains why research is so critical.Carroll also uses the same phrases several times, very close together. Example: on page 179, she writes that autumn was the \u201charbinger of the season of death.\u201d On page 184, she says the same thing. She also does this with \u201cdemons running wild\u201d and several other phrases. It was obvious enough that it kept snagging me out of the fictional dream. Also, there were a few capitalization errors, and comma errors. These were minor, however, compared to the fact that not just one, but two storylines were simply abandoned unresolved. And lastly, Dr. Moross was always referred to as a \u201cpsychoanalyst\u201d \u2013 the term \u201cpsychiatry\u201d or \u201cpsychiatrist\u201d never appeared in the book, a fact I found strange.The last comment was a personal taste issue. The \u201cromance\u201d between Caroline and her paramour, Ken Kincaid, involves exactly two modest kisses and a lot of blushing. I found that sort of avoidance of any kind of serious romance a little disappointing. I didn\u2019t expect wild sex or anything \u2013 but I find it difficult to believe Caroline would have endured horrific abuse, moved across the country, then allowed herself to believe she was in love after eight days. I wanted a little more romance and little less crazy husband.Altogether, despite the problems, I found it a quick, enjoyable, suspenseful read. Perfect for a plane trip or a rainy weekend."}, {"userName": "Trish Mayfield", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3543970-trish-mayfield", "userReview": "Caroline sets out an elaborate plan to escape her abusive husband, but she runs into a snag before she even gets out of town. She finally manages to leave town and journey across country with her little dog, looking over her shoulder the entire time. Once she reaches her destination, a small town nestled in the Colorado mountains, she sets about trying to find her niche and settle down. But Caroline knows better than to stay in one place for too long; she knows that her husband will never stop looking for her and in order to stay one step ahead of him she can never stop running. That doesn't prevent her from making friends or from falling for the ex-pro football player in town. When she finally realizes she's stayed too long, it's already too late.This was an enjoyable read but I felt like it needed something more. Porter (the husband) was creepy, but not developed in a way that made me feel satisfied when I finished the book. I would have liked to have learned more about him, more about how he became the way he was, and why he felt so attached to Carolyn. In my opinion these things were merely touched upon rather than explored deeply and in the end I can only say it was a good book.
