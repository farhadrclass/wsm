I've always found the storyline vaguely apocalyptic in terms of what the human race will bring upon itself through incessant meddling with other creatures.The story here is intense - what happens when the wise ape called the Lawgiver is assassinated (ostensibly by a human assassin). Will the utopian balance of power between apes and humans be restored? Or will chaos reign?Daryl Gregory tells an engaging story, and the artwork is punchy and engaging, without being amazing. If you're even remotely interested in the Apes universe, please don't miss this one!"}, {"userName": "Jeff Lanter", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2188384-jeff-lanter", "userReview": "Planet of the Apes is a sentimental favorite of mine. It explores prejudice and human folly both of which are topics I am passionate about. When I heard Boom Studios is making a Planet of the Apes comic, I was excited. As soon as I heard it was good, I bought it. This small, economically priced trade paperback sets up a large story set before the first movie. I have only seen the two most recent ones and I was able to jump right in and follow along. The story is essentially political and it is interesting. Daryl Gregory is a very competent writer and the tone of the book is well-done. I was instilled with confidence that this story is one I want to read. There is clearly going to be conflict between apes and humans and I'm interested to see what all comes out of it. The art is certainly unique and while it isn't my absolute favorite style, the jagged lines are appropriate for the tone of the book. The coloring is strong and overall, the art works well for the type of story. What is exciting to me about this comic is that there is enormous potential to explore all kinds of backstory in the Apes universe or tell alternative stories. As far as I can tell, outside of the movies the Apes universe is mostly untapped. This is a sharp contrast to other Sci-Fi properties that have been around and explored already. I am really looking forward to reading more of this series and I think and hope they will do justice to some great movies."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1491331-robert", "userReview": "A well-done brand extension -taking place in a familiar universe but without trying to shoehorn in established characters from film franchises."}, {"userName": "James  Love", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25480373-james-love", "userReview": "A prequel to the 1968 movie great introduction to the series mythos.

This book works well as grim and straight-up \"alternate world\" science fiction with no elements of the satire or humor oft seen in the first five Apes movies, which isn't a complaint really, just an observation.

What I liked:- Even though I have never seen any movie or read any comic in the Planet of the Apes franchise, I had no trouble getting into this book. Everything is exposed clearly and without resorting to massive chunks of text to explain back story- The art style is grittier and darker than I'm usually attracted to, but it works great with the subject matter- There are so many themes underlying the conflicts in this book. It's interesting how a war between apes and humans forces you to think about humanity- I'm starting to think this is just a Boom! Studios staple, but, female characters that are integral to the plot! There is nothing I hate more than the obligatory eye-candy damsel in distress female, in a story that is 99% male. There are good males, good females, bad males, and bad females. That's what I like to see- Also, a pregnant female main character who's still kicking ass. AwesomeWhat I didn't like:- The story is so short! I wish this was told in six-issue arcs rather than a four-issue one. It's over so quickly- Some evil characters just look too much like evil characters. They just ooze evilness- I think some of the technology is rather implausibleVerdict: This Planet of the Apes comic is a great place to start if you're unfamiliar to the franchise. It has the added benefit of being way less sexist than most comics, though the downside is that it's rather short."}, {"userName": "Michael Brooks", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8711887-michael-brooks", "userReview": "I know absolutely nothing, zero, nada about modern comics. This title/series really appealed to me in the store as I stood there like an idiot-poser, searching for something to sink my money into that WASN'T superhero related (though I LOVE superhero) but Holy Cornelius, there is a shit-ton of non-super-hero books to choose from these days and I could literally stand in the comic book store for weeks and still not have a clue...Planet of the Apes looked pretty bad-ass though so I plunked down a few bucks for Vol. 1 and 2 and now I guess I'll be back there later this week for 3 and 4, plus the other one I saw. Like I need another f'n hobby.This particular issue though was right on and pretty much what I wanted; Good writing, Great dialog, Well thought out and interesting plot/world and FANTASTIC art.This is an origin story. The apes and humans are 'enjoying' an uneasy truce and co-existing in their Industrial Revolution-esq society. Meanwhile a certain 'bomb worshipping' faction is plotting an actual human revolution. An assassination sparks an intended result and the set up to the end of ape/human relations is on.This is a fun read. Super fast and smart. There's a moment where an ape is asking about an advanced machine-gun type assault weapon. \"On his sixteenth birthday, a (human) boy would be given an automobile and an assault rifle...\" comes the reply from the ape scientist. How apt.And now it's on to Vol. 2. This is fun."}, {"userName": "F\u00e1bio Fernandes", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1926163-f-bio-fernandes", "userReview": "I'm a big fan of the original series (I loved the whole package, even the TV live action and the animated series). Hated the Tim Burton iteration. Found the recent one interesting but failed to grasp my attention (will try to watch the sequel, though - the trailer made it seem worth watching). Anyhow, this comic book series is very refreshing. Daryl Gregory seems to be a huge fan too, and he knows his way around the saga, beginning the narrative sometime around the events of the last film, The Battle for the Planet of the Apes. And it really showed what was going on the former North America by the time of the Lawgiver (the movie only began and finished with him telling to both human and ape children the final story of Caesar), and giving us what could have been a sixth movie of the franchise. This first TP begins showing us around Ape City and Skin City, twin cities already divided by malcontent and prejudice and barely held in place by an ape leader and a human mayor, both orphans raised by the Lawgiver himself. In spite of both her attempts to unite apes and humans, tragedy strikes (no spoilers). This will lead to a series of conflicts and will plunge both cities on the brink of war. The art is also something I liked a lot. Brazilian artist Carlos Magno has a jagged, rugged quality to his drawings that appeals to me. It lends credibility to the narrative. What can I say? I'm going to devour the rest of the series!"}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/864541-mike", "userReview": "This story is set about 1300 years before the original Planet of the Apes movie, in the industrial city-state of Mak. Apes are the ruling class, while humans live in a slum and work in factories and foundries. Most humans still have the power of speech, but more \"silents\" are born every year, foreshadowing the feral state seen in the movies. Other references to the movies are woven into the plot, but the story stands on its own. In the opening scene, the Lawgiver is assassinated by a human. Immediately, tensions begin to boil over in the city. Now it's up to the Lawgiver's two female proteges (one chimpanzee, one human) to try to preserve his dream of peace between the two cultures.The art is excellent. It stays true to the design elements of the movies in the apes' appearance and costuming, but it transcends the budget and makeup limitations of the movies. The Apes look alive and natural, and the city looks like a full, real city, rather than a small collection of structures. We don't see any of the other exotic settings of the PoTA world like the ruined cities or the Forbidden Zone, but I hope we will in later installments of the series.Nicely done overall, with a lot of care and a respect for the original movie series."}, {"userName": "Dann", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7780298-dann", "userReview": "Planet of the Apes: The Long War is an exciting look at an unexplored part of Planet of the Apes mythology. Set over a thousand years before Col. Taylor's adventure, the story follows the rise of a fascist Ape state in the wake of the Lawgiver's assassination at the hands of a human rebel. Writer Daryl Gregory does a good job at creating new and interest characters, and at setting up a mixed society that was hinted at at the end of Battle of the Planet of the Apes; which was the only theatrical appearance of the Lawgiver's era. Additionally, Carlos Magno's artwork is incredibly detailed and sets an atmospheric tone with its dark shading. There are also some nice homages to past and future elements of the series. One of Boom!'s most imaginative takes on the Planet of the Apes universe, The Long War is dramatic and action packed."}, {"userName": "Oscar Salas", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5515757-oscar-salas", "userReview": "A pesar del trazo ruidoso y con cierta tendencia al fe\u00edsmo de Carlos Magno, este volumen de nuevas historias del Planeta de los Simios triunfa en entregar informaci\u00f3n fresca y atractiva a la notable mitolog\u00eda de la saga. Partiendo por la muerte del Lawgiver, la an\u00e9cdota se sit\u00faa en una era en que humanos y simios a\u00fan conviven, pero ya comienzan a manifestarse elementos como los humanos mudos, la negaci\u00f3n de la tecnolog\u00eda humana y el culto a la Bomba.

I really thought that I would end up passing on the series after this first volume but I was totally swept up by the world these guys have cobbled together, and the political intrigue and human revolt just waiting to happen bring just the right amount of drama and tension to the proceedings.

Those who are against the circular timeline theory may not like the blurb on the back saying, \"Taking place before the original PLANET OF THE APES movies.\" Indeed, the assassination of the Lawgiver ignites a war that seems as though it may break the peace between apes and humans permanently, looping back to the original film.
