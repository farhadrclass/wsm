In 2009 it was Richard Holmes's \"The Age of Wonder\", the following year it was \"The Emperor of All Maladies\".Universally admired, winner of a Pulitzer prize, this book annoyed me so profoundly when I first read it that I've had to wait almost a year to be able to write anything vaguely coherent about it. The flaws that I found so infuriating a year ago seem less important upon a second reading. Though I still think it is a poorly conceived book, executed in a manner that lacks all restraint, it's nowhere near as terrible as I remembered. As I recall, the aspects of the book that most annoyed me were:(a) the author's anthropomorphism of cancer -- a stupid, unhelpful, and ineffective metaphor. In general, I detest this practice of attributing personalities to diseases. Perhaps it's a necessary psychological strategy for oncologists. But it's particularly inappropriate in the case of cancer, as it perpetuates the incorrect belief that cancer is a single disease, as opposed to a \"shape-shifting disease of colossal diversity\". For the same reason, it makes little sense to speak of a \"war on cancer\", as if it were a sentient villain with plans for world domination, one that can somehow be vanquished if we just find the magic formula. Mukherjee correctly deplores this view as simplistic and reductive, but he then proceeds to adopt it hook, line, and sinker. It's a baffling and unfortunate choice, because its inherent deficiencies lead to a kind of narrative incoherence, as well as a damaging lack of clarity about the nature and scope of the book. It's a symptom of Mukherjee's vagueness of purpose that he often refers to the book as a \"biography of cancer\", as if that phrase had meaning.(b) A complete, fatal, inability to leave anything out. There is a certain type of non-fiction writer who seems hellbent on inflicting everything he or she learned while researching the book on the misfortunate reader. No detail is spared. Everyone the author spoke to during the five years researching the book gets a mention, it would seem. As do a bunch of dead folks, some of them very dead, not all clearly particularly relevant.If, by doing this, the author is trying to impress with the breadth of his research, then he fails. Leaving everything in is the simple, intellectually lazy, option. Where non-fiction is concerned, the reader has a right to expect the author to take the trouble to shape his material into some kind of coherent whole, recognizing that while some details are critical, others are not, and pruning accordingly. All too often, though, authors forget this. Their enthusiasm about the subject leads them to lose perspective: \"the reader needs the whole story and will be thirsting for all the gory details; it would be criminal to leave anything out\".Well, actually, NO. We want you, the author, to point out to us what's important and what's not.  (c) The author includes stories of his own patients' experience with cancers of various types. I have nothing against this per se - it's entirely sensible to do so. However, it requires delicacy and finesse to report on his patients' stories without seeming exploitative or emotionally manipulative. Writers like Jerome Groopman and Oliver Sachs regularly navigate this terrain with grace and sensitivity. Mukherjee, a much less experienced writer, repeatedly crosses the line into bathos and melodrama. The language is overly dramatic; one senses also that Mukherjee succumbs to the oncologist's fallacy of believing that cancer is intrinsically \"worse\", or more serious, than all other ailments. Actually, I guess that's already evident from the book's title.(d) He has a particularly unfortunate habit of prefacing each chapter with at least one \"literary quote\", and when the book reaches a new section (there are six in all), he tends to go hog wild and give us a whole page of quotes. These seem like a minor distraction at first, but their cumulative effect is to leave the reader with the impression that (i) it is very important to the author to let the world know that he is a well-read, Renaissance dude (ii) chances are the author is a bit of a poser. The bard, the bible, St Thomas Aquinas, Sophocles, Kafka, Hegel, Voltaire, Plato, Sun Tzu, and William Blake are all mined for a portentous snippet or two about mortality and the evils that the flesh is heir to. Not to mention Gertrude Stein, Jack London, Czeslaw Milosz, W.H. Auden, Hilaire Belloc, D.H. Lawrence, Lewis Carroll, Conan Doyle, Italo Calvino, Woody Allen, Solzhenitsyn, Akhmatova... . Using just the right quote to frame an argument, or introduce a topic, can be an extremely effective device, but its effectiveness diminishes rapidly with overuse. One gets the distinct impression that the author ransacked some quotation website in the mistaken idea that sprinkling them copiously throughout the manuscript would magically confer some kind of gravitas. I reached my eye-rolling moment on page 190, introducing part three, when Doctor Mukherjee felt impelled to quote T.S. Eliot:\"... I have seen the Eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker.And in short, I was afraid.\" (e) As I mentioned, I think the structure and organization of the material leaves much to be desired. The writing is generally adequate, if a little verbose, though one tic of the author's drove me nuts. Each of the apparently infinite number of characters in the book is introduced in Mukherjee's characteristically breezy style, then immediately fixed in amber by means of a trio of adjectives. Accurate information about the personality and character of many of these historical characters being limited, one suspects that these adjective triplets may well have been chosen at random from a thesaurus. This kind of thing:childless, socially awkward, and notoriously reclusivewealthy, politically savvy, and well-connectedwealthy, gracious, and enterprisingambitious, canny, and restlessself-composed, fiery, and energeticproud, guarded, and secretiveflamboyant, hot-tempered, and adventurouscool, composed, and cautiousintellectual, deliberate, and imposingcharming, soft-spoken and carefuloutspoken, pugnacious, and boldimpatient, aggressive and goal-drivenbrackish, ambitious, dogged, and feistysuave, personable, and sophisticated (impeccably dressed in custom-cut Milanese suits)brilliant, brash and single-mindedlaconic and secretive, with a slippery quicksilver temperObviously, Dr Mukherjee is an adherent of the \"Adjectives are Your Friends\" school of writing. If this kind of tic bothers you, be warned that it really runs rampant in this book. In the general scheme of things, it's a minor detail.Enough caviling. What has the author accomplished in this book? I think he has written an overly detailed*, partially complete**, suboptimally organized*** account of the evolution of our understanding of cancer and the development of treatment options to counteract it. The result is a very readable account, though I imagine some of the second half of the book may be hard for non-scientists to understand. In general, he seems to get things right, though there are a few lapses -- most notably in his discussion of the use of mustard gas in WWI. I can find no corroboration of his statement that \"in a single year it left hundreds of thousands dead in its wake\"; one wonders if he may have confused 'casualties' with 'fatalities'. His ability to explain biomedical ideas in terms a layperson can understand seems decent, though not exceptional. I don't think the writing is of a caliber that deserves the Pulitzer prize, but what do I know?*: \"overly detailed\" - to give just one example, was it really necessary to devote a page and a half to reviewing Lister's introduction of antiseptics? And in a book which appeared to be focused on diagnostic and therapeutic options, why devote 40 pages to the link between smoking and cancer with the emphasis firmly on the legal and regulatory aspects?**: eye-glazing detail about kinase inhibitors, but nothing about anti-angiogenesis agents (Avastin was approved around 2003, as I recall, so it's clearly well within the time horizon)***: a person could get whiplash from all the zipping up and back down the historical timeline, for no obvious reason.Thank you. Now that I've got that out of my system, I feel much better."}, {"userName": "Riku Sayuj", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj", "userReview": "Anna CancerinaWhat a masterpiece. With beautiful metaphors, poignant case studies, breath-taking science and delectable literary allusions, Siddhartha Mukherjee takes us on a detailed yet panoramic trip spanning centuries. Probably one of the best science books I have ever read.My favorite parts in the book are the literary allusions that capture the depth and feeling of what is being described so well, such as Cancer Ward, Alice in Wonderland, Invisible Cities, Oedipus Rex and many more. The most memorable of all is when he encapsulates Cancer with a play on the favorite opening lines from Anna Karenina - \"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" becomes \"Normal cells are identically normal; malignant cells become unhappily malignant in unique ways.\" This unacknowledged transmutation of the famous lines encapsulates the book for me, in more ways than one.For a comprehensive take on the influence of cancer as a metaphor in our daily lives and societies, go here."}, {"userName": "Petra X", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x", "userReview": "This book took me over a year to read. I kept it on the kitchen counter and as the left-hand page pile got bigger there was me standing on the right, getting smaller. It was my diet book. A couple of pages and a pound or so every week. What I was doing was either boiling the kettle or making my own concoction of a fat and cholesterol-busting mousse that involved just holding an immersion whisk for a couple of minutes. I have such a low threshold for boredom I had to do something, so I read Emperor of All Maladies. I had previously tried to read the book in the proper way but failed. It is very heavy and not all of it is equally fascinating, but it all hangs together in the end and has given me a proper education in genes, dna, mutations, what cancer actually is and why it has been so impossible to find a panacea. It's a bit like fighting a guerrilla war. You can only defeat the insurgents where you find them and where you think they might be. It might seem as if all the rogue cells have been annhilated. But if you didn't find them or one is high in the hills watching, or there are reinforcements coming from abroad in the next few months, then the battle will resume as soon as numbers have built up and the enemy is attacking once again. That is not to say there aren't victories, but they are victories of battles, not of the war, but the war against cancer is one from which we can never withdraw.One thing struck me that was full of hope, was Mukherjee was talking about a previously rare cancer that is now quite common. It might be assumed that the cancer itself is on the upsurge, but no, it was rare because people died from it, now they live with it, so just like AIDS, it is no longer a killer but a chronic disease.7-star book. 8 even... it was that good."}, {"userName": "Julia Hayes", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5085284-julia-hayes", "userReview": "This is personal. Cancer entered my life uninvited trying to consume the body of my daughter, Aria. It was January 2008 when I heard the words, \u201cWe think she has leukemia.\u201d She was four years old.In the prologue of \u201cThe Emperor of All Maladies\u2014A Biography of Cancer\u201d by Siddartha Mukherjee, he wrote, \u201c\u2026the arrival of a patient with acute leukemia still sends a shiver down the hospital\u2019s spine\u2014all the way from the cancer wards on its upper floors to the clinical laboratories buried deep in the basement. Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells\u2014cancer in one of its most explosive, violent incarnations.\u201d What caught my attention was the word \u2018still\u2019. Leukemia happens to be one of the more successful cancers in terms lengthy high quality remissions and even cure, yet still\u2026Cancer governed every facet of our lives throughout her chemotherapy treatment, which lasted 794 days followed by 90 days of continued maintenance antibiotics, antacids and anti-nausea medication. She was lucky. Trust me, you CAN imagine my relief, my sense of humility, my inexpressible gratitude and my continued fear of its return.That fear is now what governs me and it is an awful burden to carry. I have discovered many things but there are two worth mentioning. I\u2019ve discovered that one can have fear and be unafraid and I have learned that cancer is indeed Death. It may not always bring physical death but it always brings the death of a life once lived. Deeply held convictions die. The illusion of control is smothered. Friendships and relationships wither. Its victims are forever scarred with raw oozing reminders. Pure and simple it is a scary way to have to live life.So as part of survivorship, I committed myself to figuring out how to have this fear and be unafraid. No doubt about it, information is everything! There was no way I would have been able to read this book during Aria\u2019s treatment and I\u2019m not certain I would have been able to read it had she died. It is only upon the perch of her wellness that I can dig deep into the darkest corners of cancer and extract understanding.I hold this book, this gem, like a shield of valor as I continue to face the beast that is cancer\u2014even in remission it\u2019s there. \u201cThe Emperor of All Maladies\u201d has empowered and humbled me. Dr. Mukherjee writes with grace and elegance about a topic that strikes fear like little else and takes the reader from a horrifying history, the effects of which still linger and haunt, to the fever-pitched decades of discovery, experimentation, fearlessness and compassion, to where we are now, which I am convinced is the cusp of medicine\u2019s finest hour.The early experimentation with cytotoxic therapies following WWII on young leukemia patients was particularly impressive, for obvious reasons. Three of those early identified successful agents are the very ones Aria had in addition to 5 other cocktails. I am indebted to those researchers. I am indebted to the parents of the children whose lives hung in balance of life and death for the sake of an unknown future. I\u2019m indebted to those children.It is overwhelming to consider that this exquisite and brilliant person decided to tackle medicine from its \u2018humors\u2019 to the \u2018genome atlas\u2019 detailing every twist and turn in between all the while tenderly weaving in the real life stories of real life people.We are on other side of cancer. I would like nothing more than to tell you that I feel safe. I do not. Every step I take I hear the echoed voices of the thousands of children who perished in order that my daughter\u2019s life would be spared. Still, it wasn\u2019t until I read the last few chapters of this book that I felt tangibly hopeful. I won\u2019t lie. Those chapters were hard to digest. It would be easy to dismiss them criticizing Dr. Mukherjee for losing steam or failing to keep non-medical people engaged, but this would be a gross injustice to what I think was beautifully accomplished. Namely, our understanding of cancer is at the genetic level where just a mere 100+ years ago blood and its constituents were identified and understood. Now we can get into those individual cells and understand and map the universe within them. I am in awe of this science and I am deeply, profoundly indebted to Dr. Mukherjee for explaining it to me. Yes, to me. I told you this was personal.He doesn\u2019t over simplify because the complexity of what we know now and continue to question and understand can\u2019t be toned down, cut away or reduced for easier swallowing in the layman\u2019s mouth. Cancer in all of its presentation is almost impossible to stomach and so these last chapters require the highest degree of concentration, attention and care. It is the place where anyone suffering the effects of cancer or fearing cancer can grasp a firm thread of promise.When I read the last sentence, \u201cIn that haunted last night, hanging on to her life by no more than a tenuous thread, summoning all her strength and dignity as she wheeled herself to the privacy of her bathroom, it was as if she had encapsulated the essence of a four-thousand-year-old war.\u201d I closed the book, brought it to my chest and smiled. This is an old battle. This is a known battle. This is a battle for which I was called to arms as witness to the battle my daughter fought. This is a battle that continues to terrify me. This is a battle that I can face with confidence despite my fear. This is a battle that will remain but with weapons like the minds of Dr. Mukherjee and others, this is a battle whose field will continue to shift in the favor of human well-being and dignity. Thank you Dr. Mukherjee. On behalf of my family, I bow deeply."}, {"userName": "Vicki", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4520855-vicki", "userReview": "As someone with a budding interest in diseases- whether chronic, acute, or intermittent- I immediately purchased this book for my library as soon as it was published. I anticipated a similarity to a favorite book of 2010, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, but this book dives much deeper into the history of cancer, while interweaving personal accounts of patients the author treated. This biography is different from anything I have read this year; poignant, lyrical, accessible- and most of all, real. Living, and breathing along with his patients, Siddhartha Mukherjee dives deep into the dark and the light side of cancer, and explores not only how the diseases spreads within the body, but through the lives of his patients, and the doctors and scientists who strived to defeat this complicated, deadly disease. Great read."}, {"userName": "Cait Poytress", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1419944-cait-poytress", "userReview": "Cancer fucking sucks."}, {"userName": "Warwick", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick", "userReview": "I've been wanting to read this since it first appeared, but I was just too nervous. Call it superstition. This is far scarier than any of your Barkers, your Kings or your Koontzes: there are no such things as zombies or bogeymen, but cancer is out there. Waiting for us.In The Great War and Modern Memory, Paul Fussell talks a lot about the irony of the First World War. Cancer, in the same way, is a deeply ironic disease. As Peyton Rous said, \u2018Nature sometimes seems possessed of a sardonic humor.\u2019The ability cancer cells have to reproduce themselves is the same biochemical magic that normal cells use to self-replicate; it's the whole reason we're alive. Cancer has weaponised our own life force; its \u2018life is a recapitulation of the body's life, its existence a pathological mirror of our own.\u2019Similarly cancer rates have gone up, in historical terms, not because there are more carcinogens but because (more irony) we are living longer.Civilization did not cause cancer, but by extending human life spans \u2013 civilization unveiled it.Now that so many people are surviving into their seventies and eighties, cancer has a better chance to pull off its mask \u2013 like a Scooby-Doo villain \u2013 to reveal that it was lurking there inside us all along. And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for you pesky oncologists.So this book is frightening, and you do have to brace yourself to read endless variants on the phrase \u2018unfortunately it had metastasized inoperably into her liver and brain\u2019 over and over again; however, balancing this terror is the very real intellectual thrill of following the generations of doctors and scientists who have tried to understand and fight the disease.The fight has got a bit more sophisticated than it used to be. Not a lot, but a bit. The prevailing approach for a long time was that pioneered by William Halsted, who insisted on (literally) \u2018radical\u2019 surgery to cut out as much tissue as physically possible, in order to maximize the chances of removing all the cancerous cells. One disciple, for instance, \u2018evacuated three ribs and other parts of the rib cage and amputated a shoulder and a collarbone from a woman with breast cancer\u2019. Gradually, advances in biochemistry and, latterly, genetics, have allowed for more targeted non-surgical solutions, although so far only really for certain specific cancers.In fact the most progress has been made not in dealing with cancer, but in avoiding it in the first place. Anti-smoking campaigns, lifestyle advice, along with Pap smears and other screening programmes, have been very successful at least in the West (elsewhere, things are going backwards in many cases). Once it actually develops, your options remain fairly limited, and the metric of success is still often how many years of remission one can hope for, rather than the chances of an outright \u2018cure\u2019. Mukherjee is thorough with his story and writes pretty well, although the focus is very much on the American scene, with researchers from Europe and elsewhere sometimes dealt with in a cursory fashion; at one point he even describes France and England as lying on the \u2018far peripheries\u2019 of medicine! He also goes a bit overboard with his literary credentials, bookending every chapter and section with multiple epigraphs from poets and other thinkers. It's not clear how well he understands his sources here, though, especially when you see that he's dated Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy to 1893, when Burton had been dead for two hundred and fifty years.Still, this is overall a very rich and rewarding book, full of scientific discovery and packed with historical detail. It's a thriller, it's a sci-fi, it's a horror story. Let's just hope that future editions have even more to report in the way of progress."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90798-christina", "userReview": "Deep breath. This book is elegant, extraordinarily insightful, and most of all important. Despite the big words and the complicated science, Mukherjee had me riveted from start to finish. I thought I had a knowledge of cancer before this book, but now I understand it, in all of its feverish complexity and horrifying beauty. In the history of cancer research, there have been bright flashes of brilliance combined with truths that are stupidly rediscovered centuries too late (such as the carcinogenic nature of tobacco, which was delineated by an amateur scientist in a pamphlet in 1761 but that was still, somehow, up for \"debate\" in the 1960s). What sticks with me most is that no one in cancer research really knows what they're doing, but the strength of truly great doctors lies in knowing that, instead of assuming the arrogant position that you've found the only way and other possibilities are laughable.I did not know that this book won the Pullitzer this year when I read it, but it deserves every piece of praise it gets. I will admit it was very hard to read this book with my 29-year-old sister so struck by (and dying of) breast cancer. On every page are patients suffering through cancer and its treatments, losing their battle only a few chapters before the particular solution they needed is found. Cancer is a formidable foe that, for better or worse, is tightly intertwined within our genes. One of the doctors profiled in the book had a favorite aphorism about how death in old age is not something to be beaten, but death before old age is the enemy to fight. That is what I hope for. Not extravagant medical \"advances\" aiming for immortality \u2014 just the opportunity for each of us to fully experience our mortality for a period of time that does not rob of our best years, or the chance to have children, or the chance to find love and find ourselves.

It\u2019s likely that those that were treated at this clinic had no other treatment options available in conventional medicine, and so turned to alternative medicine as a last resort. Therefore, a high death rate seems unavoidable either way. Yet, authorities have reason to believe that patients at this clinic died under suspicious circumstances.The drug in question, 3BP, has shown promising results in early testing and is cautiously referred to as a potential breakthrough treatment for cancer by some researchers. A Dutch boy called Yvar Verhoeven was treated with 3BP several years ago after his dad refused to give up on him. He wrote to over 500 cancer specialists begging for the experimental treatment. Finally, a specialist in Frankfurt was willing and treatment ensued. The drug managed to completely, spectacularly, eradicate Yvar\u2019s liver cancer. As often is the case with cancer, there was no happy ending: Yvar passed away due to related complications a year later. But not before he\u2019d toured the States during his short revival to discuss what turned out a miracle drug for him. Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant ran an article on Yvar\u2019s treatment and the progression of his cancer that\u2019s recommended reading to get the backgrounds, but unfortunately is also in Dutch. For multilinguals.At the time, Dutch professor of medical oncology at the Acadamisch Medisch Centrum, called the mechanism of action of 3BP \"very interesting\", but warned that a lot of additional research was required before it could be use in humans. Alternative clinics like the one in Germany latched onto the drug anyway. The investigation of the sudden deaths at that clinic is still in full swing, but early reports point in the direction of the clinic possibly carelessly administering manually mixed dosages of (the highly unstable) 3BP. If unprofessional usage is to blame, then hopefully 3BP\u2019s reputation will overcome the bad light it\u2019s now put in.Indeed it is 2016 now, and still cancer patients look for last-ditch options and visit quacks in their hopelessness. It's 2016 and still cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 8.2 million deaths in 2012 alone.What even is this \"emperor of all maladies\", this mysterious killer that in one way or another is a haunting part of everyone\u2019s life? What exactly does cancer entail? I didn\u2019t realize I was so fuzzy on the details myself until after I started reading this book. Mukherjee expertly explains all the what\u2019s, why\u2019s, when\u2019s and how\u2019s when it comes to cancer. He intersperses his book with compelling patient stories and mini-biographies. Just as easily, he throws around in-depth scientific information to explain the difficulties the medical world faces. And so the unthinkable happened: Mukherjee made me read 600 pages on cancer in a little over a week, and he didn't even hold a gun to my head.Cancer is a collective noun for hundreds of diseases, and every time we think we have figured out one tiny piece of the puzzle for one of those diseases, cancer races ahead of us, adapting and evolving to wreak havoc again, undisturbed for yet another decade. Or several. Mukherjee will lead you through all those decades, stretching into centuries. Starting with the queen of Persia, Atossa, who somewhere in 400 BC discovered a bleeding lump in her breast in what is the first recorded instance of cancer. With interest and horror I read how Medieval doctors experimented with a wide range of dubious treatments like mercury and lead concoctions and a whack, whack here and a whack, whack there (oh, dark, dark Middle Ages). But as the book crept closer to our modern age, something else happened to me as a reader. When reaching the late 50\u2019s and early 60\u2019s, I found myself starting to add my own anecdotes to Mukherjee\u2019s timeline. I don\u2019t think there are families who manage to escape cancer altogether, and mine\u2019s no exception. And so when Mukherjee discussed the unfortunate rise of radical mastectomy to beat cancer, I couldn\u2019t help but think of my aunt. She was diagnosed with a tiny lump, breast cancer, in the early 70\u2019s, and like 90% of women with a similar diagnoses underwent what would later be considered a morbid, disfiguring and unnecessary mastectomy. The increasing popularity of smoking and the campaign against it, too, reminded me of a personal anecdote. My granddad, who started smoking \"healthy, doctor-approved\" cigs as a boy and steadily smoked for years (even during his years in Nazi-Germany, when \u201cArbeitseinsatz\u201d forced him to work in a bomb factory) once told me that what made him stop was a TV item in the 60\u2019s in which a doctor showed two pairs of lungs: those of a smoker and those of a non-smoker. Black and white TV did little to disguise the sorry state of the smoker\u2019s lungs. The same day, he went cold turkey. He was in his eighties when he succumbed to lung cancer\u2019s little brother: lung emphysema.This is an odd book, in the sense that it evokes so many emotions at once. Due to Mukherjee\u2019s engrossing writing style it\u2019s highly entertaining, which I find an embarrassing word to describe a book on this topic. It\u2019s also both a hopeful book (the remarkable, sometimes purely accidental discoveries of scientists and medical professionals throughout the years are encouraging: forms of cancer that used to be 100% lethal can now be treated well) and a hopeless one... Mukherjee points out that when you\u2019re diagnosed with pancreas cancer, you might as well have lived in the Middle Ages: regardless of cancer experts making headlines since the 30\u2019s by claiming that \u201ccancer will be cured within the next 20 years\u201d, pancreas cancer is still as deadly today as it was centuries ago. Everything considered, this book was incredibly informative and compelling. It might well be the best book I read in 2016.

Suffers noticeably from a lack of editorial quality control -- several passages are repeated almost word-for-word (why does this happen so often in high-grade pop science? what's up with the lack of good, scientifically-literate editors?), and insufficient detail -- the book would have benefited from entire extra chapters detailing pathway-based drug discovery, the physics and mathematics of random mutation (a quick nod is paid to Schrodinger's What is Life, of which I fully approve), the use of statistical and combinatorial analyses in drug discovery, etc. Then again, less technically-minded readers are probably thankful for these lacunae. Overall, I'd have appreciated more focus on the past 20 years of oncological research, rooted as they are more deeply in the hard sciences of molecular biology and targeted pharmocology; cancer treatment has, until quite recently, been a story of observation-driven research, which (no matter how complete the collection or analysis of data points) is (and must remain) both fundamentally less effective and less interesting than the ineluctable march of theory.Then again, one of Mukherjee's major points is that \"cancer\" is a collection of protean, complex, multifaceted things, evolution in situ possessing its own elegance and beauty, a noble and almost clever opponent. So often thought hovering on the brink of defeat, it has always managed to elude its pursuers, and perhaps the proliferation of pathways hints that protein folding and recombinance will form no more a panacea than did adjuvant radiotherapy forty years ago.warning, the following are personal conjectures of a precocious computer scientist: The evolution, for instance, of repressed metastasis suppressors or disabled anti-oncogenes coding for \"undruggable\" proteins -- those lacking differentiated bonding sites along the cell membrane (see breast and ovarian cancer's infamous HER2/neu, so efficaciously targeted by Herceptin, for a counterexample), or deeply interwoven with non-renewable, inaccessible host material (eg meningioma, gliosarcoma) -- would require wholly new avenues of treatment (hence the sprezzaturic gamma knife -- \"from the rain of the cobalt, O Lord, deliver us\". Hence the radiolabeled polyethylene glycol-coated hexadecylcyanoacrylate nanospheres, in all their evanescent busting of the blood-brain barrier -- and in all their depositive despair). Cancer's accelerated evolution suggests convergence of mortality toward such rough beasts. Pathway-oriented research is critical.Anyway! This is a pretty goddamn good book.

However, diagrams involving the targeting of proto-/oncogenes and diagrams explaining the signalling cascade of some kinases could perhaps have helped those without a science background to understand with greater ease what exactly an oncogene is and the impact of disrupting/altering these pathways. Good explanations into the research behind the mechanism of action and the targets of some cancer drugs in use today. For more completion I would have liked a chapter on angiogenesis inhibitors though. Siddhartha Mukherjee writes with a style that is not dry or indigestible like a lot of science-heavy material but instead gives a very human touch to a topic that could seem tough and difficult to grasp in lesser hands.

My stars make more sense when you align them with genre or category than title perhaps.Take a book like The Emperor of Maladies: A Biography of Cancer by Siddhartha Mukherjee. How do the 5 stars I\u2019m going to rate this book stand along side a butcher thriller that I\u2019ve rated this highly too?This was a book group book and I worried that some would find the topic overally depressing to read or that others, cancer survivors themselves, might be emotionally upset. I was right and yet, I was wrong too. Yes, some of our group just couldn\u2019t read it, but most did, and found it fascinating and informative. None felt it would have made any difference when they were going through their own illness but thought it might have helped if they had read it cancer free. It also would be useful for family members.Considering there are few of us who will not either have some form of cancer ourselves, or have a love one in need of treatment, this is a book for to equip you with knowledge. Dr. Mukherjee presents a well researched book, though not easy to read, one in layman\u2019s terms and simple to understand. He begins at the beginning, giving us a timeline over many centuries, of what cancer is, isn\u2019t, what we know, what we don\u2019t, treatment tried, treatment failed, treatment success; taking us on a journey in the war against cancer. Our group learned much, shed a few tears, ate chocolate and marmite (one concoction used for cure long ago), and laughed as all living people must. In the end we felt hopeful that with dedicated doctors, committed researchers, and palliative treatment, we can live longer and better, if not cured, at least, living with cancer. Dr. Mukherjee won a Pulitzer Prize in general non-fiction for his effort.

The first hundred pages trace cancer's history, even way back to the Egyptian civilization. The next two hundred pages are about the long struggles in surgery, radiation and chemotherapy to fight cancer. Then the last two hundred pages launch into prevention, genetics and more pharmacology.With the scientific terminology toned down and explained as best as the author could, I felt I was reading a quasi-textbook. Before the topic would become monotonous there were breaks in form of stories, whether heartwarming or heartwrenching. And when not being technical, Mukherjee's writing can also be lyrical.I really like how the more common cancers: leukemia, breast, lung, etc. came into the picture one at a time as the account traveled through discovery, treatment, prevention and palliation. And then each cancer's backstory, current status and future is written about.Mukherjee used the word serendipitous several times. I think I understand.

If you say its name too often it may just manifest in front if you. Especially because both my parents are cancer survivors and my extended family is also riddled with cancer cases.And I know I am not alone in my fear of this disease. The stigma around cancer is mentioned frequently in this book.But knowledge is power, and I was determined to tackle this Beetlejuice head-on. Yet it seems the more we know about cancer the more difficult a cure-all feels.There is a plethora of cancers out there so the book mainly focuses on leukaemia, breast cancer, but also lesser known ones like Hodgkin\u2019s disease and an eye-opening chapter on lung cancer.It starts with looking at the history of medicine and advancement of surgery. With the use of ether and discovery of radium, so did cancer treatment advance right along with it. End of life care was only fought for and introduced in the 1950s \u2013 before that incurable patients were all but forgotten in the dusty corners of hospitals.But be forewarned, this is a dense book and not one to just breeze through. Half of the book deals with clinical trials and a good portion of it focuses on quite complex genetic concepts such as mutation genes (ras, myc, rb, neu). I did not find these sections as riveting as I thought I would but at least now I know what retrovirus really means.I understand that cancer is complicated, VERY complicated so although this extremely well researched piece of work is highly informative it is also at times a little academic and dry. My rating is based on my personal preference of how scientific work is presented to a layman like me. Books like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, When the Air Hits Your Brain: Tales of Neurosurgery, and my favourite Pandora's Lab: Seven Stories of Science Gone Wrong presents scientific facts in a slightly more engaging way.Recommended for readers who have a personal interest in cancer and who will be willing to slog through some complicated concepts to get to the nuggets."}, {"userName": "Rohit Enghakat", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15355957-rohit-enghakat", "userReview": "\"Cancer changes your life\" a patient wrote after her mastectomy. \"It alters your habits...Everything becomes magnified.\" This statement is so terrifying that it always rings in your subconscious mind while reading this book. The book is beautifully written and an epic tome on cancer. Full marks to Siddhartha Mukherjee for his detailed analysis and extensive research on the disease. Each chapter starts with quotes by people associated with the disease and about half-way down the book, you realise that it is not a book but a work of art painstakingly brought to life by Siddhartha. A gamut of emotions overwhelm you while reading this book. You feel sad when you read that people who have strived to fight cancer and find a cure themselves died of the disease (ironic isn't it ?). You will be horrified to learn that mastectomies (or for that matter, surgeries) were performed on patients without anaesthesia in the 18th century. You will feel the unbearable and mind-numbing pain of patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. You feel happy when patients are cured and do not relapse . You feel a sense of despondency and helplessness when doctors break the news of diagnosis of the disease to their patients, especially so, when it has reached a stage beyond cure. You feel gloomy for patients clamouring for a ray of hope to find a cure.Folks, it would be apt if you read on kindle.

There is a lot of information to get through, but I have learned more about cancer in the hours I've had with this book than I ever did in a lifetime--not even as I watched my own loved-one die of the disease. Cancer, the phantom, has now become cancer, the complex, amazing, all-consuming, aggressive, immortal, microscopic, biological, genetic disease. I don't understand everything about it, but it has become real and tangible--no longer the abstract \"concept\" that it once was to me. This book has, in fact, helped me quit smoking better than any fad psychobabble. I quit smoking half-way through the book. I had been smoking for over a decade, and while there was a two-year interval somewhere when I quit because I was pregnant and then because I wanted to take care of my child, I \"relapsed\" into my habits and my addiction. The entire time I *wasn't* smoking, I just wanted to smoke. Now it's different.

Medical non-fiction is not something I want to wrap my head around. So finally when I did pick it up from the library it was because a young acquaintance was undergoing chemotherapy and I thought it was perhaps \"important\" to understand cancer. I am surprised at what a gripping read the book turned out to be. I ran through the initial 100 or so pages that chronicle the first instances of cancer in history. Mukherjee's ability with words is obvious from the very first page. He makes the whole guided tour of cancer a fascinating one. At the same time, there is an emotional undertone to the whole story. There is the evil enemy cancer and there are the good guys........a mixed bunch of chemists, biologists and doctors who are fighting valiantly against a seemingly undefeatable evil. The personality of each of these contributors to the fight against cancer, is charmingly analysed by the writer and is one of the things I especially liked about the book.But after a fortnight and with more than half the book left, I realised I was losing the thread because of the numerous people and events that had been explained. So I actually (and geekily) made notes at the back of the book in pencil so that the basic developments would be clear to me. It still took me another month or so to complete the book. I cried, felt triumphant and figuratively bit my nails as I waited for some sort of denoument. The cure of course was never coming but I still felt there SHOULD be something. Mukherjee makes this whole labyrinthine journey seem like some Greek adventure. In the end, a basic understanding of the disease was all that decades of research arrived at. However, with an opponent as formidable as that described by the writer, this was as good a climax as those I have come across in any good thriller. The book reads like a dedication to all those who lost their lives to the disease and to those who made it their live's purpose to vanquish it. There is a strong \"personal\" sense to the writing that elevates the book. It is definitely among the most significant books that I have ever read.  quotes from the book:\"I explained the situation as best as I could.......And it is - I paused here for emphasis, lifting my eyes up - often curable. Curable. Carla nodded at that word, her eyes sharpening..........We spoke for an hour, perhaps longer. It was now nine thirty in the morning. The city below us had stirred fully awake. The door shut behind me as I left, and a whoosh of air blew me outward and sealed Carla in.\"\"Nature,\" Rouss wrote in 1966 \"sometimes seems possessed of a sardonic humour.\" And the final lesson of Rous sarcoma virus had been its most sardonic by far. For nearly six decades, the Rous virus had seduced biologists - Spiegelman most sadly among them - down a false path. Yet the false path had ultimately circled back to the right destination - from viral src toward cellular src and to the notion of internal proto-oncogenes sitting omnipresently in the normal cell's genome.In Lewis Carroll's poem, when the hunters finally capture the deceptive snark, it reveals itself, not to be a foreign beast, but one of the human hunters sent to trap it. And so it turned out with cancer. Cancer genes came from within the human genome. Indeed the Greeks had been peculiarly prescient yet again in their use of the term oncos. Cancer was intrinsically \"loaded\" in our genome, awaiting activation.We were destined to carry this fatal burden in our genes - our own genetic \"oncos\"."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "This magisterial history of cancer won a 2011 Pulitzer Prize, though not for History (that went to a new book about the Civil War) or, as Mukherjee more whimsically categorizes his own book, Biography (that went to a biography of George Washington); instead, he won in the General Nonfiction category, which, though prosaic, is certainly appropriate for a work of scientific journalism. The Emperor of all Maladies reminded me most of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, the previous year\u2019s popular science blockbuster, with both focusing on bringing complicated science to laypeople through the life stories of ordinary individuals.What Mukherjee has achieved in less than 500 pages is truly remarkable: a fairly comprehensive history, from ancient Egypt to the present day, of the discovery of cancer, its different manifestations, its causes, and the development of treatments ranging from radical surgery to sophisticated pharmaceuticals. That he manages this without alienating people who come to the material with no more knowledge than one could glean from newspaper articles and high school biology is impressive. Only in the last third of the book did I find the science stretching the limits of my imaginative capacity and my memory of AP Biology and Genetics classes, as he goes into details of oncogenes, tumor suppressors, retroviruses, etc. I managed to stay just the right side of comprehension, but I can guess that others with less patience or brain power to devote to their chosen leisure reading might have started skimming or, worse, given up.When meditating on cancer there is a fine line between depression and hope, and Mukherjee proceeds carefully to prove that there is reason for both. On the negative side, it seems likely that in the near future one in two men and one in three women in America will suffer from some form of cancer in their lifetime. All the 1950s talk about a \u2018magic bullet\u2019 to cure cancer has fizzled; there are so many disparate types of cancer that it seems impossible that there could one day be a panacea. Furthermore, the search for environmental and manmade carcinogens faces ongoing resistance from lobby groups. The most discouraging sections of the book were about smoking and the nation\u2019s reluctance to warn of the high risk of lung cancer. And it wasn\u2019t just the tobacco industry that opposed measures such as strongly-worded warning labels on cigarette packets; doctors, politicians, and smokers in general (who formed more than 40% of the population at the height of smoking\u2019s appeal in the 1940s-1950s) denied the truth that was in front of their eyes.However, this book offers the reader plenty of reasons to be hopeful. Mukherjee follows the treatment trajectory of a number of his patients, including Carla Reed, a young mother with leukemia. Her story opens the book and, as Mukherjee reveals in the last chapter, he assumed his book would also finish with the end of her story \u2013 her death. But this was not the case; instead, he comes to a close with an anecdote about going to visit Carla on the fifth anniversary of her remission, to celebrate her new chance at life. My overwhelming sense from this book is that most cancers are indeed treatable, and new medications and procedures are being developed all the time. When cancer affects us \u2013 because, for our families if not for ourselves, it is a question of when, not if \u2013 there should be no cause for despair. The \u2018biography\u2019 of cancer probably does not have an end point, but there is every chance that we can live long lives alongside it."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex", "userReview": "A terrific, comprehensive look at the history and mechanics of cancer, starting at Imhotep and ending at the no-longer-quite-literal bleeding edge of science.

It worked, too.For we book nerds, he's scattered references to a wonderful variety of books throughout: Herodotus, Italo Calvino and Joan Didion all make their way in here, as well as this sentence, to which he adds no comment: \"Normal cells are identically normal; malignant cells become unhappily malignant in unique ways.\" How great is that? You know how sometimes you read a book like this and your impression is, \"Here's an average scientist who's a pretty good writer, so I guess he's doing an okay job at conveying basic information to a lay person like me\"?

It was Hodgkin's Lymphoma.The Emperor of All Maladies, by research oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee, is a biography of cancer \u2014 its appearance throughout history, starting with a mention by the Egyptian physician Imhotep, circa 2600 B.C., and Queen Atossa of Persia, who underwent what was probably the first recorded mastectomy in history, our growing understanding and misunderstanding of the nature of this dreaded mutant cellular monster, which is really an entire family of monsters, all uniquely and spitefully different, and the eternal search for a \"cure.\"Mukherjee is an engaging writer, mixing history and social commentary, from a fairly detached perspective, with very detailed explanations of the biochemistry and genetics of cancer and its treatments. He does this in an accessible way, but this is definitely a \"sciencey\" book which will require you to draw on at least your high school-level biology and chemistry. Even if the chapters on researching the origins and cellular makeup of cancer make your eyes glaze over, though, the contemporary history of cancer research, mixed with some of Mukherjee's own cases, will keep you focused on the relevance of the topic.I suppose the weakness of the book (and the reason why it only got 4 stars) is that denseness - while Mukherjee is a good writer, at times it was like reading abstracts from a medical journal. But for anyone who's had a brush with cancer, first, second, or third-hand, there's plenty to find interesting.Cancer isn't a single disease, and there will probably be no single \"cure for cancer.\" Oncologists seem to be moving towards a model similar to that of AIDS treatment \u2014 many forms of cancer are becoming something that, while not yet, \"curable,\" are no longer inevitably terminal either. Something manageable. Not all of them, but some of them are cancers you \"die with\" rather than \"die of.\"And then there are the success stories.

My mother died of cancer before my twelfth birthday, and ever since then I\u2019ve enjoyed reading books about cancer (fiction, biographies, general non-fiction, medical textbooks, all of them) and have been terrified about getting it.

Was he ever wrong! And the author of this book does a masterful job of explaining why, and why cancers are so complicated. I enjoyed the quotes that started off each chapter, and how they stem from both science and literature. I admired how cancer is covered from the very personal (the author\u2019s thoughts and perspective, and stories of a very few patients he\u2019s known), the historical all the way through history, the research and its successes and failures, to date, the science, the various cancers touched on, so many aspects, and that\u2019s very fitting for this subject, a biography of cancer. I would have liked a bit more on the individual patients, but since I wouldn\u2019t want any cuts in the other portions, we\u2019d most likely be talking about a 1,000 page book; actually, that would have been fine with me.This book is definitely for laypeople, but for me it helped to have a bit of medical/oncology background/experience; it\u2019s not necessary though.

Now, the author readily admits that big strides toward conquering cancer will not occur by only finding cures--prevention is just as important. But, while the book has several chapters on the connection between smoking and lung cancer, no attention is paid to research related to other important lifestyle changes in preventing cancer. For example, a large body of research, both epidemiological and experiments with laboratory animals, have found strong connections between nutrition and cancer prevention. It simply stuns me that in a huge, comprehensive book like this, absolutely zero attention is paid to this very important topic."}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1207684-bruce", "userReview": "This book is subtitled \u201cA Biography of Cancer.\u201d Mukherjee is an oncologist at Columbia University, and he writes well; the text reads less like a history than as a novel. Yet Mukherjee is scrupulously factual. This history, with a few gestures toward the confusions and mysteries of cancer and treatment in the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, really begins with the research of Sidney Farber at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital in the late 1940\u2019s, when Farber began approaching the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia with anti-folates. To me, as a pediatrician, Farber\u2019s name is legendary, as is that of Louis Diamond who worked with him. About twenty years later, when I was just an intern, prospects for these children were marginally better, but the outcome of their courses were often heartbreaking. The cases that Mukherjee describes affected me markedly as I read about them; they were so nearly the same as those children I cared for. \u201cTo name an illness is to describe a certain condition of suffering \u2013 a literary act before it becomes a medical one.\u201d With the naming, with the diagnosis, begins a seemingly inexorable process of evaluation, treatment, and waiting. As Mukherjee states, \u201cThe only way out would be the way through,\u201d a statement and fact that hauntingly remind me of Dante\u2019s journey through the Inferno, probably an apt metaphor. Reading this book makes me want to return to a reading of medical and surgical pioneers whom Mukherjee mentions \u2013 Vesalius, Galen, Hippocrates, Virchow, Baillie, and even the author of the ancient Edwin Smith papyrus, all works that I read many years ago when in the thrall of reading original works in the history of medicine. The books are still on my shelves, and I itch to reopen them.Equally fascinating is the only gradual application of true scientific principles to cancer therapy, the surge in the use of controlled studies and statistical analysis that we so much take for granted today. Too often grand theorizing, anecdotal descriptions, and reliance on the word and reputations of authoritative physicians guided therapy. Mukherjee traces cancer treatment from doing nothing (because there seemed nothing to do), to surgery, on to the application of radiation to tumors, and then to the introduction of chemotherapy and beyond. The story is one of science \u2013 sometimes methodical, sometimes serendipitous \u2013 human egos and personalities \u2013 sometimes arrogant, sometimes humble \u2013 and politics \u2013 often driven by simplistic notions and individual agendas. It is a fascinating story, fascinatingly told. (Sometimes I wished for more of the perspectives of the patients themselves.) When discussing the political initiatives and maneuverings with regard to legislation funding \u201cthe war on cancer,\u201d Mukherjee provides important insights as to how a national mood can drive legislation; during the fifties and sixties the national threat was seen as external, fueling the Cold War and its responses, whereas by the seventies the locus of anxieties was more internal \u2013 political cynicism, spiritual rot, etc \u2013 and the focus on cancer as an ultimate threat burgeoned. I was pleased to see that Mukherjee has included information about the history of hospice and palliative medicine; I had not known that the first hospice program in the US was launched in 1974 at the Yale-New Haven Hospital, just five years after I graduated from the Yale School of Medicine.Preventing cancer attracted more interest during the past thirty years or so. Often these investigations required the method of statistical correlation, tobacco smoking and lung cancer being a case in point. Mukherjee is not shy about outlining the strategies and deceptions of the tobacco industry to escape culpability and regulation, and he is equally forthright about acknowledging the resistance on the part of patients to quitting smoking, all leading to a continuing exposure on the part of millions of future patients to a potent carcinogen. Infectious agents also \u2013 viruses and bacteria \u2013 were found to be related to the development of cancer. What was really needed, however, was a better understanding of carcinogenesis, why and how cancers develop. With the recognition that early diagnosis and the institution of earlier treatment was important in curing cancer, a new emphasis on early detection through screening procedures developed \u2013 Pap smears for cervical cancer, mammograms for breast cancer. At the same time, in the 1980\u2019s, with the onset of the AIDS epidemic and further chemotherapeutic advances with a variety of cancers, oncologists pushed for ever more aggressive treatment regimens, often combined with bone marrow transplants. Complicating this period, rife with both unwarranted optimism and vigorous skepticism, were the appearance of shoddy scientific studies and even cases of researcher fraud, often accompanied by the relaxation of FDA oversight in the release of drugs being used. Eventually the realization came that cancer was a variety of diseases, each requiring different understandings and treatments. Attention by necessity turned back to basic science, the study of fundamental mechanisms, back to the cancer cell itself. I found Mukherjee\u2019s discussion of virology, retroviruses, and oncogenes especially clear and interesting. The genetics of cancer is absolutely fascinating, with new knowledge, new drugs, and new insights appearing all the time.\u201cMedicine begins with storytelling. Patients tell stories to describe illness; doctors tell stories to understand it.\u201d Mukherjee has captured these stories into a compelling and sensitive narrative.Now retired, I have less immediate access to information at the frontiers of medical knowledge and research. But information is increasingly all around us, in the print media, on the internet. Granted, much of this information is sensationalized and unreliable, but nevertheless there are many sources which present good science, carefully reviewed and reported. I shall be reading these sources now more diligently. Mukherjee\u2019s book reads like a thriller, a thriller chock full of frustrations, coincidences, missed chances and brilliant insights. It is gripping at the same time that it is deeply humane. It enables the reader to understand current articles and scientific findings in a fresh way, putting current research into a comprehensible context. The journey is fascinating and ongoing. And, perhaps above all, it brings one back again and again to the lives and experiences of those who have encountered and lived with cancer in its many forms. It was a privilege to have read this book, and I am grateful to Mukherjee for it."}, {"userName": "Kaitlin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin", "userReview": "This is one of the books I read as part of #WellcomeBookPrize project I am doing with my friend Elena. We've been reading some of the books from previous shortlists for the Wellcome Book Prize, and this was by far the longest of the ones I have so far read. It's also a non-fiction, a pretty heavy and dense non-fiction, which means it's a pretty time-consuming read for me, but with all of that said it was a mixed bag overall. This follows the 'life' of Cancer and what we know of the illness which claims so many lives yearly in so many forms. Cancer is something I had limited and vague knowledge of before reading this, and even now I feel like I learned a lot about some of it, but not a lot about other parts. This is a fairly objective look at the history, the discoveries and the progress we have made towards determining the cause and cures for Cancers. One element I found a bit lacking in this read was the connection. I tend to find biographies or factual books pretty dry when there's no people to really connect to, and although there are plenty of cancer-patient cases and discoveries cited in this book, most of them are cited by way of explaining a discovery or development, rather than to show what it's truly like. I personally like to get a bit more invested in a story, and heaven knows there are plenty of very tragic cancer-based stories both fiction and non-fiction out there so I don't mean I wanted this to be another one, but I would have enjoyed a bit more of a personal driver for the topics this book covered. We are being told the story of Cancer from the author who is clearly incredibly knowledgeable about the topic. There are some elements of Cancer which are hugely complicated and took generations to fully uncover and unwind, but I think the author does a pretty good job of helping the reader to understand most of these discoveries. There were some moments (quite a few) in this book where I felt like we had a fair bit of repetition. We're focused on various types of treatments and diagnosis and Cancer strains, and it can all get a little bit too same-y as a reader sometimes, especially if you start out with limited knowledge of genes, genomes, chromosomes etc. I do think that lots of it is explained in a simple way, but it can become a bit overwhelming at times to be bombarded with all the scientific language of the Cancer sector and try to take it all in. There were a few elements of the book I particularly liked and those mostly focused on the historical elements of the illness and the initial break-through discoveries. I found the more modern discoveries to be a little too baffling at times or a bit too similar to things I already knew from studying in School, but the older treatments and break-throughs were a mixture of grotesque, fascinating and horrible all at once which kept me quite engaged.I also found the more recent discussion of causes, e.g. smoking, to be a really eye-opening and highly interesting facet. The fact that we had huge corporations denying the science to boost their money intake and eventually we had to push out tobacco companies by removing advertising and adding large warnings to packaging...Maybe it's just because I love learning about packaging and advertising anyways, but I loved that whole section.I also found the discussions of money and wider-world organisations to be pretty intriguing. Of course doing scientific research costs a lot, and so to gather the money to research there were things like the jimmy fund and other charities and organisations which were set up explicitly to research Cancer. These campaigns started off the advertising boom for science and also played upon the guilt and fear of the population and I found that element to be very cool and a new angle I hadn't thought of much when it came to Cancer. On the flip side, along with the repetitive nature of some sections of the book we also have a fair few occasions where the author goes off on tangents and discusses things we already know or that weren't all that relevant/interesting to me personally. I think there were certainly some parts of this book which really could have been cut and filed down a bit... Overall I learned a lot, not least that the journey has a long way to go, and it's incredibly complicated. I do think there's been a whole lot of progress and it's great to see it laid out comprehensively in a book like this, but I also think that new discoveries and plans which are discussed at the end of the book could really change things. I think this is a book I would recommend to people, but probably only if you have a real desire for the intimate details of Cancer as this book does go into a fair bit of detail. It's long and sometimes tedious, but ultimately very fascinating too, and I would rate it a 3*s in the end."}], "description": "Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 1439107955 (ISBN13: 9781439107959)The Emperor of All Maladies is a magnificent, profoundly humane \u201cbiography\u201d of cancer\u2014from its first documented appearances thousands of years ago through the epic battles in the twentieth century to cure, control, and conquer it to a radical new understanding of its essence. Physician, researcher, and award-winning science writer, Siddhartha Mukherjee examines cancer with a cellular biologist\u2019s precision, a historian\u2019s perspective, and a biographer\u2019s passion. The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with\u2014and perished from\u2014for more than five thousand years. The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance, but also of hubris, paternalism, and misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out \u201cwar against cancer.\u201d The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist. From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave cut off her malignant breast, to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjee\u2019s own leukemia patient, Carla, The Emperor of All Maladies is about the people who have soldiered through fiercely demanding regimens in order to survive\u2014and to increase our understanding of this iconic disease. Riveting, urgent, and surprising, The Emperor of All Maladies provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments. It is an illuminating book that provides hope and clarity to those seeking to demystify cancer.", "title": "The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7170627.The_Emperor_of_All_Maladies", "average": 4.3, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1280771091l/7170627.jpg", "reviews": 5346, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3032451.Siddhartha_Mukherjee", "name": "Siddhartha Mukherjee"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Science", "History", "Health", "Medical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7170627-the-emperor-of-all-maladies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9667124-the-emperor-of-all-maladies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10632190-the-emperor-of-all-maladies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11482377-the-emperor-of-all-maladies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9299686-the-emperor-of-all-maladies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6737914-the-emperor-of-all-maladies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13437245-the-emperor-of-all-maladies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276428-the-gene", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25409816-the-laws-of-medicine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17165949-the-best-american-science-and-nature-writing-2013", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30135182-a-brief-history-of-everyone-who-ever-lived", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17165669-granta-124"]}
