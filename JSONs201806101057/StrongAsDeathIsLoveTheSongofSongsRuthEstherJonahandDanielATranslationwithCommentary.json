Reading the originals, even as a now cynical adult, I still find them quite shocking. What were they thinking? After averting genocide against the Hebrews, beautiful wise Queen Esther not only gets revenge on her enemy Haman, she has all ten of his sons, all gleefully listed by their exotic names, impaled on stakes. Time to party. Then the text explains that after they killed off the entire Haman clan, the Hebrews were too ethical to loot the family's goods....is that supposed to be noble or is it some kind of ancient humor? (Like the country western song: I shot the sheriff, but I didn't kill his deputy...) Robert Alter carefully explains that none of this is at all historical. The Persian empire was famously tolerant of different religions, the threatened genocide would not have been possible, and neither was the revenge. The biblical authors just needed a story to justify a little carnival celebration at the Purim time of year since other biblical texts didn't already provide a pretext for partying. That's a relief. Alter is quite comfortable with the expansive eroticism of the Song of Songs, and provides a wonderful gloss. His take on Ruth is interesting: The only book in the Old Testament where all the characters are well-intentioned, and the most radical book in the Old Testament for his approval of intermarriage, and even with a happy ending, and no one gets impaled on a stake. Of course the poetry of Ruth and Naomi is genuinely noble, my favorite still. But it probably did not sit well with traditionalists who opposed what Alter antiseptically calls \"exogamy.\" Like other scholars, Alter places late works Jonah and Daniel as transitional between the ancient world of the Old Testament and the world of New Testament Christianity. Jonah anticipates a monotheistic god that should work for all ethnic groups, also anticipates the idea of eternal life, not a commonly accepted notion in the older books, and Daniel comes up with an eternal kingdom and resurrection from the dead. All handy concepts for the Christian era. Alter carefully and succinctly identifies the wild mythological characters in Daniel's visions with the corresponding historical names, like Alexander the Great and Antiochus. Just enough information so the curious can go to Google and get some traction. He really gets the role of footnotes as guideposts. He clues you into each genre as the reader encounters them: what is vaguely historical, what is wish fulfillment, what is fairy tale, what is folk lore. For those with an interest, there are quick references to the previous scholarship, without getting too technical. I still find the Old Testament shocking, but with Alter's guide, I can better appreciate \"what they were thinking,\" and see it as a remarkable human document, a letter washed up in a bottle from the distant human past."}, {"userName": "Scriptor Ignotus", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7422525-scriptor-ignotus", "userReview": "This latest installment in Alter's translation and commentary on the Hebrew Bible doesn't pack quite the same punch as the others; but this is no fault of his. The five books translated here are not literary masterpieces of the caliber of Genesis, Exodus, 1-2 Samuel, or Job. These are late biblical books, written in a form of Hebrew (and Aramaic, in the case of Daniel) that is as remote from early biblical Hebrew as John Updike is from Shakespeare, as Alter intriguingly puts it. Despite their late composition, each of these books with the exception of the Song of Songs harkens to the days of the Babylonian exile, and the authors of these texts evidently tried to use an archaic writing style that would make their work fit in better with the earlier books of the canon; but their slip-ups give them away. The writers of these texts were politically conscious in a way that the writers of the Pentateuch and the wisdom literature were not--and it shows. The Song of Songs needs no introduction. The erotic poetry has always made Jewish and Christian interpreters slightly uncomfortable, and this discomfort has lent itself to a tendency to render what is clearly a sensuous love poem as an abstract theological metaphor. For Jews, the two lovers are said to represent God and the people of Israel; for Christians, they represent Christ and the church--but not really. I don't think Christ would have compared the church's hair to a flock of goats, or its neck to a tower, and I don't think God would compare the breasts of the Israelites to clusters of fruit. I think the book should be enjoyed for what it is: endearing love poetry from a culture of Iron-Age pastoralists. Ruth is also a love story, but one with a bit more of a political bite. Alter notes that this is the only book in the entire biblical canon in which every character is a decent person who is just trying to do the right thing. The widowed Ruth wants to be redeemed so that she can be at home among the Hebrews, while Boaz wants to observe the customary procedures before he lays claim to her. The political gem in this happy little story lies in the fact that Ruth is a Moabite woman. The Moabites were foreigners who were widely mistrusted among the Hebrews, much like the Samaritans were. The author of Ruth turned this prejudice on its head by making a Moabite woman the progenitrix of the line of King David.Esther is conspicuous for being a purely political tale, and for not mentioning God even once. An all-too-impressionable king is persuaded to propagate an edict condemning the Jews to eradication, and it's up to his new wife, Esther, who is herself Jewish, and her cousin Mordecai, to save their people. The idea that the famously tolerant Persians would attempt to commit wholesale genocide against one of their subject peoples is entirely contrary to the historical record, but the author of the book probably didn't really intend for it to be about the Persians anyway, but rather the Seleucids, who ruled the region at the time in which the book was probably written. Nonetheless, the story works as a kind of fable for how providence can subtly work its will in the realm of political power. Plus, it gave the Jewish people the holiday of Purim, and now I can impress people with my knowledge of how the holiday got its name. For as well-known as Jonah is, it's a remarkably short book. Everyone knows the story of Jonah, the prophet who was cast into the sea, swallowed by a whale, and who survived in the belly of the whale for three days. The Hebrew doesn't specifically say that it was a whale; only that it was a large sea creature. But how long is the list of suspects, really? Less well-known than the whale story is what happens before and after it. At the beginning of the book, God instructs Jonah to go to Nineveh and tell the people there to repent of their wicked ways. As Alter says, this would be a bit like God sending a Rabbi to Berlin in the 1930s to tell them about the perils of antisemitism. Jonah says \"fuck that\", and books it in the other direction, which is why he ends up on a ship in the Mediterranean. After the whale episode, he comes to his senses and travels to Nineveh, where, to his disappointment, the people actually listen to him and avoid God's wrath. When he complains to God about this, God delivers one of the best sick burns of the Bible: \"Are you good and angry?\" Or, to use a more contemporary rendition, \"U mad?\" By the period of Jonah's composition, the God of Israel is now beginning to be understood as the God of all mankind; and his universal compassion is frustrating for Jonah's Israelite nationalism. Daniel is the latest-written book in the Hebrew Bible, and just as the Book of Revelation does for the New Testament, Daniel ends the canon on a note of apocalyptic mystery. Though the author draws parallels between Daniel and Joseph, Daniel is not the literary character that Joseph is. He is rather a vessel for the author's apocalyptic imagination. A statue with clay feet toppled by a stone; the two-horned ram of Persia shattered by Alexander; number sequences that have spawned innumerable interpretations by people who think they can pencil in the Day of Judgment on the calendar. The book is striking for its dualities: the alternating Hebrew and Aramaic in which the book was originally written, the narrative of the first half of the book and the prophecy of the second half, the fabulous and polemical tones that seem to be competing for control over the same text. It's quite a way to end things."}, {"userName": "Jsavett1", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1289730-jsavett1", "userReview": "Like all of Alter's translations and commentaries, this was absolutely riveting and exquisite. My Hebrew is not nearly good enough to know whether Alter's translation is \"good\" in the sense of it mirroring the original's text's sound and sense. What I can argue, however, is that Alter's translation is GOOD in the sense that I found it more compelling, moving, and challenging than any I've read in more canonical texts.Alter's commentary as well is indispensable. What I love about his series of award winning translations is that, unlike say the JPS Study Torah, one can use Alter's book and it's commentary to deepen and enrich one's practice in real time. I've brought a copy of Alter to shul with me many times and found his literary commentary quite a nice compliment to Giants like Rashi, Ibn Ezra etc.Another great installment in Alter's series of Tanach translations. Don't hesitate to pick this up. Song of Songs stands out especially."}, {"userName": "Keith", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4873736-keith", "userReview": "This is the latest installment of Robert Alter\u2019s excellent translations of the Hebrew (and Aramaic) Bible, this time covering what he calls the Late Biblical Books. This is a bit of a miscellany, including the sensual Song of Songs as well as a love story, a fable, a fish tale and an apocalyptic vision. Some of these works are unusual among the Biblical canon for their portrayal/perspective of women and their secular focus. Several of the books don't even mention god and one seems to have been written for entertainment purposes only. This collection is not as strong as Alter\u2019s other translations, but not because of anything Alter has done. Other than The Song of Songs, these stories are only mildly interesting. If you are looking for a translation of these particular works or have an interest in reading the books of the Bible, I highly recommend this book. But if you are simply looking for a good read, I\u2019d suggest looking somewhere else.The Song of Songs **** \u2013 This a lyrically beautiful poem (or collection of poems). Much has been said and written about this wonderful work that manages to be intensely sensual without being graphic or bawdy. Alter, as usual, provides his concise translation and informative notes. What his translation lacks in the sweeping lyricism of the King James Version, he makes up for in balanced presentation, copious notes on context and interpretation, and a duplication of the terse Hebrew original. Alter\u2019s version \u2013 perhaps because he tries to keep as closer to the original \u2013 lacks some of the sparkle and verve of other translations. If you are looking for a beautiful translation, I highly recommend the Ariel and Chana Bloch version. (You can see my review here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...). They provide even more copious notes, but take a bolder (more radical?) interpretation of the poem as a unified cycle. But Alter\u2019s translation remains excellent and informative. The Book of Ruth *** \u2013 This is a rather slight love story (I guess you could call it that). The brief story tells of Ruth\u2019s dedication to her mother-in-law after the death of her (Ruth\u2019s) husband, and her subsequent marriage to Boaz. It has some charm, but the dating/marriage rituals of 1000 BC are not the stuff of modern romance. The Book of Esther *** \u2013 This story, which Alter says has been described as a fable, a farce, a fairy tale and a satire, is about the planned extermination of the Jewish people in Persia and Esther\u2019s saving of them. It reminds me of a tale from the Arabian Nights. The name of god does not appear, there is no divine intervention, nor even a discussion of Biblical commandments. It\u2019s mildly entertaining. The Book of Jonah *** \u2013 The absurd debate over the the literalness of Jonah being swallowed by the fish overshadows the more important (and, in the Hebrew Bible, unusual) universalist message about the mercy of god. That\u2019s too bad. The Book of Daniel *** \u2013 Of all the Old Testament books I\u2019ve read (so far), this one is most redolent of the New Testament because of the miracles and the apocryphal prophecies. Daniel\u2019s vision of the end time clearly influenced Jesus\u2019 views. And it is not hard to see that the Book of Revelation was influenced by the Book of Daniel. In reading the visions at the end of the book, it helps to know the history of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the Greek king of the Seleucid Empire, as much of the vision are allegories for his empire\u2019s downfall. (As Revelation is largely an allegory for the fall of Rome.) Without this knowledge, the visions are just a bunch of magical animals destroying each other. It should be noted that the prophecies are remarkably accurate \u2013 because they were written after the incidences happened. The predictions of events after the writing of the book were, uh, not so accurate. It\u2019s funny how that happens. The Book of Daniel is interesting for a number of reasons. It speaks of immortality and resurrection with an afterlife that rewards the good and punishes the wicked (12:2), the Ancient of Days (7:9) and the coming of the Kingdom of God (7:13-14). The Book of Daniel also introduced us to the expressions \u201cfeet of clay\u201d (2:31-33) and \u201cwriting on the wall\u201d (5:5 and 5:25). It\u2019s also interesting that the book is written in Hebrew and in Aramaic. Alter doesn\u2019t say so, but I suspect the prophecies at the end were written in Hebrew to make them seem old (and thus remarkable for their accuracy). Aramaic was by that time the common language of the Middle East, and Hebrew would have been associated with earlier, much older books of the Bible. Interestingly, Alter\u2019s translation does not use the well-known phrase Son of Man (7:13). He uses \u201cone like a human being,\u201d arguing that the text is talking about an angel that has the appearance or attributes of a human being."}, {"userName": "Cameron", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10380828-cameron", "userReview": "The commentary on Daniel alone is worth the price of the book. Not quite a 5 star for me, but that's mostly personal preference, due in part because this isn't my favorite collection of Biblical literature.Make no mistake though, Robert Alter is one of the greatest Biblical scholars to date. And the fact that he has taken it upon himself to translate the entire Hebrew Bible - and release it in individual volumes *with* commentary - is nothing short of a gift. These books are gorgeous and well worth your investment."}, {"userName": "Bob Wolniak", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8385614-bob-wolniak", "userReview": "The translation with fairly brief but insightful footnotes is valuable and easy to follow.

His notes act as more than just guides in understanding the context of each story, but as tools in understanding the problems associated with translation and its limitation. By far the most literary and poetic translation of the Hebrew Bible I've read."}, {"userName": "Longhare Content", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27957116-longhare-content", "userReview": "I've been on an ancient works odyssey, ba-da-dum-that began with Dante. Yes, I know. But that's where it started because after reading the Hollander Inferno, I went back to my ancient Fitzgerald for a dose of Dante in terza rima, which sent me forward to Milton because, well, that's a natural progression, isn't it. From Paradise Lost/Regained I went to Job because that's where all the morning star action originates.Getting a handle on biblical texts is tricky. I have read that Job is one of the oldest books in the Bible. I have read that it is one of the later texts. Scholars. What are you going to do. I couldn't find a consensus date for Job (there may be one, but the Internet is, let's say, murky on the subject), but I did re-read the Iliad and the Odyssey and the Aeniad and the Theban plays and did a lot of Greeking geeking on Edx. Consider, the Mediterranean and Mesopotamian worlds. They both begin with M and many of the extant writings from both were contemporaneous with one another.I also made Northrup Frye my dishwashing buddy, listening to his lectures on the Bible as well as some miscellaneous lectures by Robert Alter and David Rosenberg. I get instantly weary when I hear/read people say the Bible is a \"bad book.\" It is usually said in a knowing way, that it is repetitious, tedious, contradicts itself, and frequently uses -eth instead of s. Which is about as relevant as saying it needs more cowbell. Good grief. It isn't a novel.Strong as Death Is Love is the title given by Robert Alter to his translation of The Song of Songs (from which the title comes), Ruth, Esther, Jonah, and Daniel. Ruth and Esther are strong points, Jonah is a trip, Daniel has a One-of-These-Things-Doesn't-Belong-Here feel to it. The Song of Songs is pretty exquisite. None of these little books is easy reading, but Alter's running commentary is illuminating. Reading Alter's version side by side with Rosenberg's (they both blow reverential kisses to King James' men at work, but not to the more modern attempts at making the KJV more readable for non-Jacobeans) is a lesson in translation. Here is the coy KJV on the SofS's female narrator's disastrous hesitation to get out of bed in answer to her lover's knock. (The impatient lover takes her answer for a rejection and flees before she can reach the door to call him back.)\"I have put off my coat: how shall I put in on? I have washed my feet [I have a horse, I totally get this]; how shall I defile them ['cause, you know, dirt floor]?\"Alter has:\"--I have put off my gown,  how can I don it?I have bathed my feet, how can I besmirch them?\"Rosenberg has:\"I was riveted with anxietyI was as lifeless as an empty robeI couldn't movemy feet were a statue's feetI was lifeless clayI was naked earth\"Rosenberg doesn't try to be faithful to the words of the text, but rather to capture the je ne sais qua of the poet. He obviously has a different take on the lazybones's reluctance to go answer the door, but it all amounts to the same thing: the boy is gone. Our gal turns to the chorus, yes, there is a chorus--the girlband Daughters of Jerusalem:--I make you swear, O daughters of Jerusalem should you find my lover, what shall you tell him? that I am in a swoon of love.which the Beatles render: \"She said she loves you\"To which the chorus responds:\"What makes your lover more than another?\"Ouch!It's a shame people get all nervous and weird around biblical texts because they are missing out on the best stuff--the stuff of early literate people who were ardently working out for themselves what it means to be human. Which brings me back to Job, which is not in this collection. Alter issued his translations of the Bible in thematic chunks more or less as the Hebrew Bible categorizes them--the books of Moses, the prophets, the wisdom books, the Psalms, the story of David. I had a hard enough time finding Strong as Death. I suppose I may have to break down and order them.

The title is taken from a line in the first section, Song of Songs, and that was my favorite one (boding well for the last two translations of Alter's I'll read, that are mostly poetry). As with the previous volumes, I learned a lot about the textual history of each book and the issues that come up in producing translations like these. All five (Song of Songs, Ruth, Esther, Jonah, and Daniel) were unique in many respects, yet all products of the Late Biblical period and sharing common threads of oddity compared to what came before. Song of Songs had beautiful erotic poetry, Ruth a story of devotion that Republicans would do well to take to heart, and Esther was just as satisfying, if slightly funnier than I remembered. Any person seriously interested in religious texts would do well to have this in their library. It's a book of high quality from beginning to end."}, {"userName": "Russell Fox", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729679-russell-fox", "userReview": "Up until this point in my long journey through the Old Testament, I've followed the arrangement of the books of the Bible exactly as they are presented in the Revised Standard Version. However, I've also been able to make use of Robert Alter's superb translations and guides every step of the way (with the exception of Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah). Now, however, having completed the Wisdom Books, I confront the Prophets, which is a stretch of the Biblical canon that Alter hasn't yet been able to tackle. Hence, to finish off the last Alter's remaining guides, before I dove into Isaiah, I decided to do a little jumping around: The Song of Songs (Song of Solomon), Jonah, and Daniel. Strong As Death Is Love covers all of them, and more.Like all the other of Alter's translations, this book was filled with fascinating detail, enabling me to appreciate and learn from the Biblical text in a way I never have been able to before. Alter's reason for collecting all of these texts together is that they all appear to have been late literary constructions, in the case of Daniel perhaps as late as the second century BCE, by which time Rome has come onto the scene of the ancient world. I confess that I was sometimes nonplussed at how dismissive he was of the possibility that Daniel (or Ruth, for that matter) might have been a late re-creation of a much older folktale, perhaps one grounded in actual history--but then, he's the scholar of Hebrew texts, not me. None of these stories and poems stuck with me as much as did the Psalms, or Ecclesiastes out of the Wisdom Books, or anything from the Torah for that matter, but they're great literature nonetheless. The Song of Songs really is, at certain moments, clever and erotic love poetry even by contemporary standards. Esther is a great story, and Jonah and Daniel (the first chapters, anyway) are fun \"faith-promoting\" tales of a sort. Before the slog through the Prophets (which is what killed me off the last time I tried to make it all the way through the Old Testament, while I was a church missionary nearly 30 years ago), it was nice to work through these interesting, extraneous bits of the canon."}, {"userName": "Dennis Ashendorf", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17118570-dennis-ashendorf", "userReview": "Professor Alter matters.
