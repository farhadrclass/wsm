As I can make out better the shapes, I realize I have seen this before. The image in front of my eyes is like a black and white version of Arnold Bocklin\u2019s painting and now I am transported to his Isle of the Dead. There is deep silence. I can only hear the very faint stirring of the water as the boat slides over it. Well no, there is also a faint melody which becomes clearer as we approach the shore. I now recognize Sergei Rachmaninov\u2019s symphonic poem that grew directly out of the painting, with its Dies Irae. This poem is also in black and white in spite of all its harmonic colours. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKeTd...As we arrive in the island, we see amongst the dark thin and tall trees a palace made out of ice. The air is chilly, not cold, not freezing, just crisp and sharp.We enter this palace of iced crystal and there is a salon, a dancing salon and around it there are seven adjacent chambers or alcoves and there are hammocks and we see several figures lying down, horizontally. They are the \u201chorizontals\u201d, the blessed in their stability. Although we are moving in space, there is something flat, like a fresco in a medieval church or maybe this flattened perspective is my illusion. We join the horizontals and lie down on the hammocks and wrap ourselves with white blankets and the spectacle begins.The Polka of the Seven Steps.The Polka begins and fourteen of those figures in the hammocks get up and form seven couples and get ready for their dance. The horizontals have become dancers and the spectacle at last begins.First advance the Winter & Summer. They set the tempo. Now it is Summer, now it is Winter, and round again. This couple does the rounds so well and draws you in their swirling so absolutely that time passes without breaks and from its cyclicality there seems to be no escape. As they dance we see the sun streaming in with white light and it is warm, but when it touches the dark it freezes. It is magic Snow and it has revelatory powers.Second in this diversion, step in Highland & Lowland. Highland is less haughty and more humble and its vision has an advantageous viewpoint. It sees that existence is enchanted. In comparison, Lowland seems perfect, the desired state. But when it gets closer we see that it is formed out of the common and the petty. In its prejudices it just assumes too much.In clashing clothing the Western-Northern & the Eastern-Southern come now to the fore. Austerity in the garments and the frosty detachment of Western are apparent in the well measured steps, but the exotic frills and extravagance of the bright Eastern delights and allures everyone, especially its dancing companion. They perform the most frivolous steps. It is difficult to tell who follows whom and who sets the pace.And now it is the turn of the Unhealthy & Healthy. The Unhealthy is denied activity and barely moves, but it is openly apparent that it lives the music more profoundly. It dances with its soul. It has clearly been blessed, anointed with TB, which confers additional sagacity. The Healthy seems flippant, and just watching it move around from my hammock makes me giddy. There is a disturbing senselessness about it.Soon the next couple seems make their way and stand in front of us. Radicalism has pulled Humanism in. The latter dances elegantly, not missing one step and is dressed in light and harmonious tones. It also takes in stride the thrusts of Radicalism, who is dressed in dark shakes. There is a great deal of push and pull in this dance, but Humanism remains unperturbed.Suddenly a great deal more light comes in and the next couple are announced: Apollo & Dionysus. With the light a magnificent figure takes center stage. He comes out alone, but is soon followed by his scruffy partner, Dyonisus, who in a most disorderly fashion trots in. If Apollo is impeccable Dyonisus is gaudy. In this movement of the polka Apollo\u2019s steps are clear and straight, and we look in amazement how undisturbed they are by Dyonisus\u2019 delirious swings.The light dims suddenly as we reach the seventh and last dance and Eros & Thanatos make a dramatic entrance. They hold each other very tightly and intensely, as if their dancing were their salvation. Life as a temporary passage. Their steps are the most intricate and we see how their legs seem to slide out of their bodies and intertwine themselves into a new unity. But this is no polka, it is a tango. The erotic dance that could make you die.The dancing music finishes and the first bars of G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung are heard. In still circumspection we prepare to leave this island, a mountain emerging magically from its surrounding waters. And as I try to remember whether I have seen these dancers before, I wonder if, after Thomas Mann's invitation, we now understand life and its purpose somewhat better, and if we have realized the overwhelming power of art and its dangers\u2026."}, {"userName": "Helen \u03a1\u03bf\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af \u0395\u03c9\u03c3\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2   Vernus Portitor Arcanus

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4426615-jason", "userReview": "I am in a good mood today!Which should be readily apparent, because if I were not, this book would probably have received only two stars from me\u2014not as a reflection of its literary quality per se, but rather as a reflection of my own reaction to it.Here is what happened yesterday: I finished this book and tossed it forcefully onto the coffee table next to me in what may be seen as a transparent attempt to attract attention to myself (which is something I tend to do often) and sure enough someone picked it up, read its title, and asked me what it was about, providing me with a wonderful opportunity to roll my eyes dramatically (another move with which I am somewhat familiar) and ask, \u201cDo you realllllly want to know?\u201d I explained that it was about this aimless young gentleman who decides to kill some time before starting a new job by visiting his cousin in a tuberculosis sanatorium high up in the Swiss Alps, but who begins to exhibit symptoms of ill health himself and whose visit becomes lengthened by increasing bouts of time until his initial 3-week stay has been stretched out to a full seven years, and that this book was about his experiences in that sanatorium over the course of those seven years. By this point, my enquirer\u2019s eyes were wide with interest and I was astounded. In explaining the premise of a book that has actually kind of bored me, have I inadvertently extolled its virtues? Is this book perhaps more interesting than I am giving it credit for? The short answer to that is, NO! This exchange with my enquirer has merely revealed what I think is the essence of The Magic Mountain\u2014it is a place that appears interesting, a place a reader might wish to visit on account of that appearance, but once there it is a place that traps the reader for seven long years and berates him with its endless philosophical musings and its explorations of moral ideologies, and only upon being finally discharged does the reader discover his eyes are bleeding from all the fork stabbing.Now I have gone ahead and made it all sound so horrible. The truth is, this book is very well written. It has a lot to say about the cyclical nature of time and humanity\u2019s fruitless attempts to anchor itself against its continuous passing. It speaks of the mysteries of biology and brilliantly relates the starting point of life to an unexplained (and unstoppable) illness. It presents death as merely an extension of life as opposed to its diametric opposite and eerily makes the reader feel comfortable with it. And it exemplifies the importance of spiritual health to providing fulfillment for a life that is by most accounts cursory and meaningless. But at the end of the day, it is a book for the brain, and as much as that may be adequate for some, I need a book with a heart and soul. I need a book with characters I can relate to and empathize with, and unfortunately this book had none of that. So, to the extent that I \u201cenjoyed\u201d my visit to this sanatorium, it is not a place to which I would consider returning any time soon."}, {"userName": "Megha", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1727205-megha", "userReview": "Imagine hiking up a steep mountain. You are not quite winning the game of hide & seek with the Sun and it has got its fiery eyes firmly on you. Your legs are chewing your ears off with incessant grumbling. With each step you take, a wish to flop down right there grows stronger. One of these steps carries you to a spot where a spectacular vista suddenly opens up before you. For the briefest moment, the scene in front of you consumes not only your vision, but your consciousness. It is only in the next moment that it registers that the arduous climb is over and you know it was a worthwhile endeavor.The Magic Mountain is one such hike. No other book has made such heavy demands on my patience (not even Tommy Ruggles' Gravity's Rainbow, I think). The Magic Mountain is incredibly dense and often slow going. But then there are places where the narrative sprouts wings and soars. Not to say that I didn't like the other bits of the book, but it was these few outstanding chapters that confirmed that effort vs. reward dynamic was in my favor.It is certainly not a book with a high degree of obfuscation. Mann doesn't make it any more difficult than it needs to be. He narrates and explains everything with a lot of patience and wisdom. The book description refers to The Magic Mountain as a dizzingly rich novel of ideas and that's exactly what it is. It is a highly erudite read all the way through comprising of many a intellectual discussions and debates. One of the frequently occurring themes in the book is the philosophy of time. The subjective nature of time is explicated in great detail. In fact, the book itself has an onomatopoeic quality, in that the narrative seems to move slow when time is not passing swiftly for Hans Castorp, and its picks up the pace when Hans feels that time is flying by.Some of the other themes include life, death, illness, love, humanism, progress, modernism, irrationality of society, effect of war and then some. Did I say it was dense? Many of the characters are representational of one idea or another. The character of the protagonist, however, goes through a wonderful growth during the course of the novel. His character development, both spiritually and intellectually, is certainly one of the highlights. It may look like this book has a very serious disposition, but really there is plenty of humor and irony in the way Mann writes.You may have seen some other reviewers mentioning the transcendent chapter Snow. I can't go without mentioning it as well. It is by far the best thing about the book. A beautiful, sublime piece of writing. Hans Castorp comes out transformed by the experience, and so does the reader. While other reviewers don't mention it, Danse Macabre was fascinating as well. For people living in a sanatorium, death takes on a very urgent position. Danse Macabre, literally meaning Dance of Death, looks into that very abyss.Thomas Mann said that The Magic Mountain should be read twice. I have read through once, but I can't say I have twirled all the ideas around on my fingers and looked at them from all the sides. I do want to re-read it some day. For my next dose of ideas, I will perhaps be knocking at Musil's door."}, {"userName": "Warwick", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick", "userReview": "You\u2019re faced with a daunting task when you try to talk about The Magic Mountain \u2013 there are so many threads that to pull on one seems unfair to the others. For some it\u2019s a meditation on time, for others it\u2019s the foundational \u2018sick-lit\u2019 masterpiece; it\u2019s an allegory of pre-First World War Europe, say one group of supporters; not at all, argue others, it\u2019s a parody of the Bildungsroman tradition.And yet despite the profusion of themes and ideas, this is a supremely contained book. \u2018Insular\u2019 you might almost say, were the etymology not so inappropriate; perhaps \u2018hermetically sealed\u2019 is better (and indeed that becomes an important phrase in the text). The world of this novel is a closed one, or so at least it appears \u2013 sealed off from reality, with its own rules, its own time, its own space. The extent to which the characters here can interact with the \u2018real\u2019 world is something they have to discover themselves through the book\u2019s seven-hundred-plus pages.The plot can be disposed of in a single statement: that a young engineer called Hans Castorp takes a three-week visit to see his cousin in a Swiss sanatorium and ends up staying for seven years. This is not a novel of events, but a novel of ideas. (The main idea was apparently, I wonder if I can write seven hundred pages where literally nothing happens?)At first the set-up seems to anticipate the whole imprisoned-in-a-medical-facility trope that has subsequently become familiar \u2013 as Hans gets sucked into the routine, and gradually diagnosed with problems of his own that prevent his leaving, I was picking up on a vague One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest vibe, and I also found myself thinking of the Alpine clinic scenes from On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service or even the Timothy Cavendish bits of Cloud Atlas.But the danger here is more subtle. The staff are friendly and accommodating (despite a sense that \u2018above and behind [the Director] stood invisible forces\u2019); you can leave for a trip into town, or even discharge yourself, whenever you wish. To paraphrase The Eagles, you can check out anytime you like, but you can never discount the possibility of a tubercular relapse forcing you to return with a collapsed lung. The patients claim they want to get out, but their attitude, in reality, is much more ambiguous. There\u2019s a brilliant moment where Hans rails against the surroundings a little too much, and the director of the sanatorium calls his bluff with a quick examination:When he was done, he said, \u2018You may leave.\u2019Hans Castorp stammered, \u2018You mean\u2026but how can that be? Am I cured?\u2019\u2018Yes, you\u2019re cured [\u2026]. As far as I\u2019m concerned, you may leave.\u2019\u2018But, Director Behrens. You\u2019re not really serious, are you?\u2019And suddenly we realise that Hans does not want to leave at all. He doesn\u2019t want to go back to the responsibilities and expectations of his engineering job; here, in the sanatorium, he has freedom \u2013 freedom, and also a certain license in behaviour granted to the sick.This is what lies behind the book\u2019s treatment of time, and why the narrator can refer to the story as a Zeitroman, a \u2018time-novel\u2019. The inhabitants are in some sense degraded by being there, but they also cherish their privileged status, exempt from the world\u2019s calendar. One character speaks of the sanatorium as an \u2018isle of Circe\u2019; it is a \u2018life without time\u2019, where the \u2018true tense of all existence is the \u201cinelastic present\u201d\u2019 (ausdehnungslose Gegenwart). In such an environment, there is a tendency for ideas, ideologies, dogma, to clash together unmediated \u2013 and also, conversely, for petty jealousies, flirtations and sexual desires to be unnaturally heightened.Indeed this must be one of the most sexual novels ever written to involve so little actual sex. Everything is sublimated into various social conventions, so that Hans\u2019s quasi-relationship with his mysterious fellow patient Clavdia Chauchat is initiated when he asks to borrow a pencil, and a climactic instance of sexual union is described, adorably, as a moment when \u2018the use of informal pronouns achieved its full meaning\u2019.Psychoanalytic critics have had a field-day with the pencil-lending, not least because it reminds Hans of his homoerotic feelings for a childhood friend. But what makes the book truly Freudian in a less trivial sense is its close examination of the links between sex and death, eros and thanatos. One of my favourite chapters is the section called \u2018Research\u2019, where Hans stays up all night reading books about anatomy and biochemistry and feeling intimations of mortality mixed with a vague horniness. Life is imagined as \u2018a secret, sensate stirring in the chaste chill of space\u2019 \u2013 \u2018matter blushing in reflex\u2019 \u2013 while evolution is \u2018the quintessence of sensuality and desire\u2019, stirred into action \u2018by reeking flesh\u2019. Gazing out over the nighttime Alpine landscape, Hans sees only a cosmic, naked (female) human body:The night of its pubic region built a mystic triangle with the steaming pungent darkness of the armpits, just as the red epithelial mouth did with the eyes, or the red buds of the breast with the vertically elongated navel.(This whole virtuoso section reminded me of university, spending all night poring over textbooks while trying to manage teenage hormones.)So much for the metaphysical games, the grand narrative theories. I\u2019d expected something of the sort just from the novel\u2019s reputation. What I had not expected \u2013 and it came as a very pleasant surprise \u2013 was to find that The Magic Mountain is a comic novel. In fact the more I think about it, the more convinced I am that it\u2019s this tone that lifts it, for me, into the first rank. Apart from anything else, it\u2019s so important for the reader that they have some counterpoint to the grandiose theories so many of the characters want to expound upon, and Mann provides exactly that through the endearing character of Hans himself, our \u2018thoroughly unpretentious\u2019, \u2018unheroic hero\u2019. High-minded comments \u2013 and there are many \u2013 are rarely allowed to stand without an invitation for us to smile at them:\u2018Did you know that the great Plotinus is recorded to have said that he was ashamed to have a body?\u2019 Settembrini asked, and with such earnest expectation of an answer that Hans Castorp found himself forced to admit that this was the first he had heard of it.Later, after a similarly earnest apophthegm from another character, we are allowed to eavesdrop on Hans's thought process: \u2018Well, there\u2019s a Delphic remark for you,\u2019 he says to himself. \u2018And if you purse your lips tight after delivering it, that will certainly intimidate everyone for a bit.\u2019 In fact even when Hans is the one delivering the sententiousness, he can\u2019t take himself very seriously:\u2018There are so many different kinds of stupidity, and cleverness is one of the worst. Hello! Why, I think I\u2019ve just coined a phrase, a bon mot. How do you like it?\u2019(\u2018Very much,\u2019 comes the deadpan reply. \u2018I cannot wait for your first collection of aphorisms.\u2019) Without these ironic shifts in register, the book would still be fascinating but it would be monotone: with them, the effect is almost orchestral.Such things are brought out especially well by John E Woods in his 1996 translation, an improvement on the old 1927 Lowe-Porter version in every way. Lowe-Porter, it has been said, succeeded in translating the novel into German, and having tried the first few pages of her translation I admit I found it almost unreadable. I had to order the Woods from the US, but it was worth it, despite the godawful cover and font design used by Vintage, and passing over also the Americanisms scattered through the text (catercorner being perhaps the most jarring; Woods also silently amends the patients\u2019 temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit!).Towards the end of the book, we finally suspect that Mann is pushing us beyond the \u2018hyperarticulate\u2019 arguments and towards real-world applications of these theories \u2013 to \u2018leave logomachy behind\u2019, as the narrator says at one point. The final couple of pages of this book move for the first time beyond Davos, to show us the Western Front \u2013 and we realise with a terrific jolt that it is 1914 and time has not stopped moving after all. Suddenly we appreciate the full importance of the novel\u2019s investigation into how love and life can be made to emerge from death.But now I am in danger of just rephrasing the book\u2019s final lines in less felicitous language. Suffice to say that the whole mountainous project comes together in the climax, and it all ends, characteristically, in a question mark. Readers today may be better-placed than they wish to supply the answers."}, {"userName": "Michael Finocchiaro", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro", "userReview": "Thomas Mann, The Magic Mountain: \"An ordinary young man was on his way from his hometown Hamburg to Davos-Platz in the canton of Graub\u00fcnden. It was the height of summer, and he planned to stay for three weeks.\"Here we are introduced to Hans Castorp (one of my all-time favorite bumbling protagonists) with a load of telling adjectives. Mann insists that he is a young man (although he will act like an old man in many ways) and ordinary (and we will see that this was probably a fatal flaw in being too ordinary). I intentionally left the second phrase about the fact that it was summer time and yet he was heading to a place (Davos) that folks usually frequent in the wintertime. This adds a bit of mystery which is cleared up in the following chapter. The detail that Davoid was in a particular canton is typical of Mann's style of including sometimes useless details just to ensure that the photo he is painting is as realistic as possible. This book in general is one of the funniest that I have ever read (with Natsume Soseki's I am a Cat (\u543e\u8f29\u306f\u732b\u3067\u3042\u308b)) and, if you haven't had the pleasure yet, you will not regret either.

Imagine being rid of all your earthly woes of finding means of survival and all the elements that stand as pillars supporting the normative structure of life during a sojourn in a special, secluded place. Imagine a miniature diorama of a society thriving on its own, divorced from society at large. If you haven't been successful in imagining a real life scenario fitting aforementioned descriptions, do not despair. You can always discover this specially constructed safe haven in a certain fictional sanatorium in the Swiss Alps where our protagonist Hans Castorp languishes for seven whole years.The experience of reading this book is akin to a painstaking hike up a dangerously steep slope. (Excuse the overused analogy but it happens to be quite apt)There are long dry stretches requiring ritualistic finding of one footing after the next, ensuring that as a reader you do not slip and tumble headfirst into the gaping chasm of incomprehension. And then there are the moments of perfect clarity when snippets of Mann's wisdom filter in like errant rays of sunshine through the drear of many tedious descriptions of long walks and repetitive conversations, making the long and difficult climb seem worth it all of a sudden.\n\"But he who knows the body, who knows life, also knows death. Except that's not the whole thing - but merely a beginning, pedagogically speaking. You have to hold it up to the other half, to its opposite. Because our interest in death and illness is nothing but a way of expressing an interest in life...\"\nThe summit of this \"magic mountain\" becomes the location of a metaphorical watch tower from where the spectacle of our collective civilizational march is viewed, dissected and analyzed with precision. The quirky patients inhabiting the sanatorium become mere proxies for some nations or disparate points of view, their inter-relationships often symbolic of some deeper ideological conflict woven intricately into the fabric of existence.But despite the sheer brilliance of this premise, there's something off about this book. Something that prevented me from according that final star. Even if this remains a lengthy and eruditely presented discussion on Europe's inner contradictions, its juxtaposition of progress in all spheres of life and violence brewing under the veneer of that sanctimonious progress, as a work of literature it is somehow imperfect and rough around the edges. Since I was often tempted to believe it would have worked better as a nonfictional philosophical discourse. It's sort of like what my eloquent friend Dolors says - 'The book lacks a soul.' How succinctly put. (Read her well-argued review here)The characters are employed as mere mouthpieces, never resembling well-drawn sketches of actual people with their own stories. The situations and backdrops are mere contrivances specifically begotten to tout ideas on life and death. It's as if the whole narrative is an elaborate ruse developed to convey Mann's thoughts on the state of Europe prior to the First World War. During my moments of exasperation with the book I was able to recall a few of Nabokov's thoughts in his article on Lolita- \n\"...All the rest is either topical trash or what some call the Literature of Ideas, which very often is topical trash coming in huge blocks of plaster that are carefully transmitted from age to age until somebody comes along with a hammer and takes a good crack at Balzac, at Gorki, at Mann.\"\n Clearly a jibe at TMM if I have ever seen one. Not that I agree with Nabokov's opinion on TMM being topical trash but it surely gives rise to the suspicion that if you strip the book of all its allegorical significance, almost nothing substantial remains. And with the turn of the last page, it leaves the reader with a sense of indescribable dissatisfaction about having just finished a journey neither very rewarding nor enjoyable. Maybe a re-read some time years later on in life will restore the elusive star. Maybe it will not.Originally posted on:- 31st October, 2013"}, {"userName": "Ian \"Marvin\" Graystik", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graystik", "userReview": "Socratic Dialogues\"The Magic Mountain\" is a sequel to \u201cDeath in Venice\u201d.Just as Plato\u2019s Socratic Dialogues were the foundation of the novella, they guide the narrative of \"TMM\", a \"Bildungsroman\" that is concerned with the education of the protagonist, Hans Castorp, during the seven year period from ages 23 to 30.Castorp doesn\u2019t so much learn or grow by his physical actions. The character development is intellectual, a development which is equally apparent in both the author and the reader.Because it's structured as a Socratic Dialogue, there is no guarantee that all readers will take the same message from the novel. Mann presents us with two, if not multiple, pedagogical or metaphysical points of view. While we might be able to infer Mann\u2019s preference, it's not always clear, and it's left to us to draw our own conclusions.This reinforces the reputation of the novel as one of the great works of literature, not only because its subject matter is the rival ideas upon which civilization is founded, but because it lets us be the judge.As with Socrates, the goal is to make us think methodically about the issues, rather than to encourage us to approach them with inflexible preconceptions or to depart captive to rigid dogma.In Which the Hero is Heightened and Enhanced\"TMM\" is set in a sanatorium on a Swiss mountain, where patients suffering from tuberculosis go to receive treatment and a cure.To do so, they must leave the flatlands of Germany and elsewhere and reside \"up here\" in a rarefied, pure, idealized atmosphere and world. They undergo a \"change of air\" and learn to breathe afresh.They are pulled out of day-to-day timetables, responsibilities, cares and conflicts. On the mountain, they can see things for what they really are.Not that it is all heavenly and harmonious: there is no less rivalry and conflict or, for that matter, gossip up here. At times the novel betrays an almost comic fantasy tone associated with fables, morality plays (Goethe described his \"Faust\" as a \"very serious jest\") and fairy tales (not to mention \"The Master and Margarita\").Olympian RivalriesThe title of the novel derives from Nietzsche\u2019s \"The Birth of Tragedy\":\"Now it is as if the Olympian magic mountain had opened before us and revealed its roots to us. The Greek knew and felt the terror and horror of existence. That he might endure this terror at all, he had to interpose between himself and life the radiant dream-birth of the Olympians.\"For Nietzsche, the Olympian gods helped mankind battle \"that overwhelming dismay in the face of the titanic powers of nature.\"Because the gods lived the lives of mortals, their example gave the Greeks strength, resolve and moral guidance. However, unlike Christianity, there were multiple gods, and thus scope for differences of perspective or emphasis, in particular, the difference that most interested Nietzsche, the difference between the Apollonian and the Dionysian (a preoccupation of Mann in both \"Death in Venice\" and \"TMM\").Dialectics, Dialogues and DiabolicsIn both Nietzsche and Mann, there is a polarity, a dialectic, a double-sidedness.The dialectic is ideological. However, Mann presents it to us in the form of a dialogue or duel between two characters. It is personalized, as it is with Dostoyevsky.While the dialogue is often essayistic in total length, it is not just fodder for a dry \"novel of ideas\", it is a dramatic embodiment and reflection of a personal and philosophical tension between two vital people. It comes to us in short, sharp, punchy grabs. It\u2019s like going 15 rounds with two intellectually-gifted prize fighters.If you\u2019re not interested in the rivalry of ideas, this novel might not be for you. If you are, it could be a wonderful reading and thinking experience.Still, Mann\u2019s refusal to always resolve the tensions between the ideas might not be to your liking. Some see it as disingenuous, witness this assessment by one of my favourite critics, Alfred Kazin, who once met Mann in Hollywood:\"Mann, the creative peer and contemporary of great experimental novelists like Proust and Joyce, is easier to read but actually harder to grasp through the external conventionality of his form and the heavy load of Germanic philosophic apparatus. \"He is so continuously double-sided, so \u2018safe\u2019 in manner and so subversive within, so much the pompous German pedant in his literary manner and in his substance so representative of his aesthetic, nihilist, decadent generation, that it is almost impossible to do justice to the range and elusiveness of his mind. \"Either one makes too much of only one side of him or one imitates his own tiresome Olympian irony, the suavely self-protective use to which he put his doubleness by effectively concealing his real opinions.\"Kazin damns Mann with faint praise. In contrast, the Marxist Hungarian critic Georg Lukacs (who unknown to him was the model for the character, Leo Naphta) declared Mann the \"last great bourgeois writer\", writing:\"Thomas Mann is a realist whose respect, indeed reverence, for reality is of rare distinction.\"Whether or not the subversiveness, the elusiveness, the concealment to which Kazin adverts is real, it might have contributed fuel to recent attempts to go beyond Mann\u2019s writing and venture into his personal life, in particular for the purposes of reassessing his legacy on the basis of perceived homoeroticism. This trend is prurient, but in an age of media voyeurism seems to be inevitable. Regrettably, it distracts attention from the writing and the subject matter, which can\u2019t be any more fundamental to the concerns of any civilization, and was regarded as sufficiently meritorious to justify the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature.Taking Stock of Time and SpaceHans Castorp is an inexperienced and inexpert engineer, a simpleton, a na\u00eff, a neophyte.When he arrives at the Berghof, he takes stock of both time and space. He takes his bearings, he is measured, he measures himself, so that he can determine exactly where he is and what he's about (as he will later use a thermometer to \"measure\" his temperature and his illness). However, gradually, he loses his sense of time and place, and as if he were on Olympus or in Heaven or Eternity, his experience becomes timeless, almost dreamlike. Apart from the dialogues, nothing much happens to Castorp. He doesn\u2019t cover a lot of space. The narrative doesn\u2019t depend on the passage of time, so much as the transmission of ideas. Before we know it, Mann has quietly covered seven years in 700 pages.In a way, Mann plucks Castorp out of his world, out of his time and makes him listen to pedagogues, perhaps because, like most of us, he is not yet able to think particularly deeply about these issues himself.Not only is \"TMM\" a great work of literature, but it is about how a great work of literature works: it takes us on a journey from innocence and ignorance to experience and wisdom. It\u2019s we who experience character development. If we are lucky, we can put our lessons into practice in our lives. Settembrini versus NaphtaThe principal dialogues are between Settembrini (an heroic individualist) and Naphta (a divine collectivist).Settembrini is an eloquent Italian, \"a dark man of graceful carriage, with curling black moustaches.\" He\u2019s a humanist, an individualist, a rationalist who upholds the beauty and dignity of man: \"Our Western heritage is reason \u2013 reason, analysis, action, progress.\"Leo Naphta is small, thin, clean-shaven, ugly, hook-nosed, bespectacled, well-dressed. He is a Jew by birth, but a Jesuit by inclination and training. Paradoxically, he is a collectivist who supports both the Catholic Church and Socialism:\"Like many gifted people of his race, Naphta was both natural aristocrat and natural revolutionary; a socialist, yet possessed by the dream of shining in the proudest, finest, most exclusive and conventional sphere of life. \"[In effect, he had made] a declaration of affection for the Roman Church, as a power at once spiritual and aristocratic (in other words anti-material), at once superior and inimical to worldly things.\"Perhaps, what Naphta is seeking spiritually is both Heaven in Eternity and Heaven on Earth. Both require a respect for authority, the authority of God (and the Church) and the authority of the State, whether religious or secular.Sometimes, to establish and protect the authority of a State, it is necessary to use force. In other words, sometimes, Naphta must advocate Revolution and Terror. Life and DeathThe contrast between the two worldviews is revealed in their perspectives on Death.Settembrini sees Death as part and parcel of Life, as the flipside of Life. If it is differentiated from Life, it takes on a negative quality:\"Severed from life, it becomes a spectre, a distortion, and worse. For death, as an independent power, is a lustful power, whose vicious attraction is strong indeed; to feel drawn to it, to feel sympathy with it, is without any doubt at all the most ghastly aberration to which the spirit of man is prone.\"Naphta sees the nobility of man solely in terms of the Spirit, not the organic or animal aspect of the human. Death and disease are in dialectical opposition to the life of the Spirit, yet they govern and influence Life at the level of the non-spiritual human, the animal, the organism that is capable of disease, of illness, of dissolution, of suffering:\"Disease was very human indeed. For to be man was to be ailing. Man was essentially ailing, his state of unhealthiness was what made him man. There were those who wanted to make him 'healthy,' to make him 'go back to nature,' when, the truth was, he never had been 'natural.' \"All the propaganda carried on to-day by the prophets of nature, the experiments in regeneration, the uncooked food, fresh-air cures, sun-bathing, and so on, the whole Rousseauian paraphernalia, had as its goal nothing but the dehumanization, the animalizing of man. \"They talked of 'humanity,' of nobility \u2014 but it was the spirit alone that distinguished man, as a creature largely divorced from nature, largely opposed to her in feeling, from all other forms of organic life. \"In man\u2019s spirit, then, resided his true nobility and his merit\u2014in his state of disease, as it were; in a word, the more ailing he was, by so much was he the more man.\" Man is less than Spirit.Point and Counter-PointCastorp listens to all this and remarks:\"You say we did not come up here to get wiser, but healthier, and that is true. But all this confusion must be reconciled; and if you don\u2019t think so, why then you are dividing the world up into two hostile camps, which, I may tell you, is a grievous error, most reprehensible.\"Just as if he is listening to two Greek gods, he regards the two pedagogues as aristocratic. However, in the chapter entitled \"Snow\", he sees the light in a dream-like state on an Olympian mountain:\"Man is the lord of counterpositions, they can be only through him, and thus he is more aristocratic than they. More so than death, too aristocratic for death\u2014that is the freedom of his mind. More aristocratic than life, too aristocratic for life, and that is the piety in his heart. \"There is both rhyme and reason in what I say, I have made a dream poem of humanity. I will cling to it. I will be good. I will let death have no mastery over my thoughts...Death is a great power...Reason stands simple before him, for reason is only virtue, while death is release, immensity, abandon, desire. \"Desire, says my dream. Lust, not love. Death and love\u2014no, I cannot make a poem of them, they don\u2019t go together. Love stands opposed to death. It is love, not reason, that is stronger than death. \"Only love, not reason, gives sweet thoughts. And from love and sweetness alone can form come: form and civilization, friendly, enlightened, beautiful human intercourse...For the sake of goodness and love, man shall let death have no sovereignty over his thoughts. - And with this - I awake.\" The Awakening of LoveSo, after point and counterpoint, after the working of the dialectic, finally we have an awakening of Eros.\"Adventures of the flesh and in the spirit...granted thee to know in the spirit what in the flesh thou scarcely couldst have done. Moments there were...when there came a dream of Love...may it be that Love one day shall mount?\"As in \"Death in Venice\", Castorp awakens to the light of Desire, Lust and Love. Only, while Aschenbach died in peacetime, Castorp survives in wartime. Still, in neither case does Mann allow us to witness his protagonist mount his Love. Perhaps, after all, it's legitimate for Kazin and others to wonder why Mann denies his protagonists the fulfilment of Love? This doesn't necessarily mean that we readers are also denied. We must find and consummate our own Love while we fend off Death.\nVERSE:Homo HumanusHerr Settembrini,Homo humanus,Man of acumen,Judgement and learning,Carping pedagogue,Chronic windbag andOppositionist,Proudly discerning,Wielding influenceOn those gullible,Confiding, childlike, Still full of yearningWith his garrulousGift of florid gab,Lively harangue andAnimus burning.Naphta's Catholic Communism[After and in the Words of Thomas Mann]I believe not in original sin,But in an ideal state Of man as the child of God,A paradise without government And without force, In which there is neither Lordship nor service, Neither law nor penalty, Nor sin nor relation After the flesh.

I admit that I only struggled my way through the first 170 pages, but that was enough to convince me that I should not waste any more minutes of my precious life wading through any more of this drivel. I know, I have also been chastised for criticising modern art in the same way. Tracey Emin's \"Unmade Bed\" and Thomas Mann's \"The Magic Mountain\" will just have to live in the pile of junk that I fail to understand.I realise that I am in the minority, as most reviewers and professors of literature believe this to be a masterpiece, and probably the best book to come out of Germany in the twentieth century. Then again, Hans Christian Anderson's boy who recognised the nakedness of his Emperor as those around him admired the splendour and wonderful colours of their leader's new clothes, was also in the minority. Perhaps, then, I shouldn't feel too bad about my opinion of this amazing piece of creative writing. It may also explain why English literature was the only `O' Level that I failed, despite having been a prolific reader all of my life. It just happened that the books that were chosen for my studies for those exams also bored me to tears. Following some comments on this review, I have added these notes (27/9/09). I have always been a prolific reader, sometimes having up to five books on the go simultaneously. I read most novels at the rate of 80-100 pages per day. With The Magic Mountain, I found that I had been reading a few pages at a time for well over a month, and had only waded through 170. There is so much description attached to the narrative that all that had happened by this stage was that the main character had arrived at the sanatorium, met his old friend and most of the patients. It had also come to light that he really wasn't there for his own medical benefit. He isn't really ill. Rather that he was there for a bit of a rest, and escape from the drudge of life in Hamburg with his guardian, and to be with his best mate. If the descriptions were interesting, and succeeded in conjuring up a wonderful picture in my mind, I wouldn't feel quite so bad about it. Encouraged by some of the other reviews, I revisited the book, and read the passage describing Hans's adventure in the snow, as that was said to be the best part of the book. I remained unimpressed. Perhaps I would have enjoyed this book more if my German language were up to the standard required to read the original, but I doubt it. I am not alone in my disillusionment. Several of my friends and family, some of them professors and schoolteachers, share my views, and I have yet to meet anyone who has survived to reach the end. It is obvious that there are many who have read, re-read, and thoroughly enjoyed The Magic Mountain. I am happy for them and I rejoice that the world is full of variety, particularly of taste.

Such connections are there for the reader to discover throughout the novel, which deals not only in dichotomies, but in ambiguities (such fertile ground for contemplation).But what makes The Magic Mountain a pleasure to read is the extraordinary sensitivity to the human condition that is evident throughout. Mann portrays the relationships between the characters in sublime detail, filled with subtle emotional interplay (of uncertainty, desire and conflict), which characterize the complex and segregated internal nature of real human relationships; an insight that is rarely conveyed so well in literature.The Magic Mountain is long and challenging, but depth of the writing and the consistent beauty of the prose are such that it was rarely boring. There's so much here that I feel it's impossible to absorb entirely in a single reading.

Those who live are dying a little, and on this mountain one lives very slowly. It tells the story of Hans Castorp, a young man without many qualities, who the author just does not want to call mediocre. He was a little exhausted by the end of his engineering course. Before assuming a high position in the firm of relatives, he goes to a sanitarium on the mountain to rest for fifteen days, under the pretext of visiting the tubercular cousin. Doctors have discovered that it has the disease in it, and it stays internal as well.Then a transformation takes place in him, gradually, as he goes to live in this place where it seems that time does not exist. In the brief retrospection of his previous life, it is interesting to note the parallel between his biography and that of Thomas Mann, who was also fatherless (distant in Brazil) and, although his mother, indifferent to his relatives. Speaking in the biographical parallel, we will already notice the incredible chapter on the beach walk - this in the mountain, in a place that was covered with snow, even in the summer - as if the mother of the author, brazilian, of Paraty, left in that atavistic feeling of the sea.Get to know the guests of the clinic, which seems to have nothing extraordinary. They are in fact ordinary people who have taken on an incurable disease at the time, and live with it in the best possible way. The better this coexistence, the more normal they seem, the more they gain psychological depth, the more we know how much ordinary human people carry within themselves.How could it not be, there is religious discussion - in the person of two of the most interesting, most complex characters, a writer and a Jesuit, two revelers at first, who grow and dominate the scene. It is the city of God and the city of men in struggle, both charged with errors, trying to justify and impose themselves. The outcome of this dispute will be the climax of the novel. No winners, but with loss and disappointment. However, life goes on.Hans Castorp knows or thinks about knowing love. He does not realize that those who live in their conditions have no right to love. As if to say that those who live in the conditions in which we all live life have no right to love. It is on the eve of World War I, when the world will change. Hans Castorp suddenly matures - that is, we say that time did not exist there, but it is so slowly that the transformations happen in people who, when they see, are already others. As if it were all of a sudden.Nothing could be suddenly in an 800-page book. Nothing could be more surprising in a book of so many pages, in which nothing happens, and that leaves us trapped in that world full of humanity, bleeding unnoticed, dying - and gazes with death - while we go making us richer inwardly. It is not just Hans Castorp that grows throughout the novel. It's not just the characters - not greatness like us - that grow throughout the novel.

Either he goes along, continuing to 'play king' with his trains of thought honed inside the 'Magic Mountain', or all his questions are answered in regards to death and the end of all things. Either path is a happy ending, in my opinion. Even nothing is an answer, and would be no more than an extended rest cure, only more final and everlasting than the others.

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498525-fionnuala", "userReview": "Reviewed in December, 2013I love when the themes of two books I happen to be reading overlap. And when those themes also reflect aspects of my own life experience, I feel a wonderful convergence, an exchange of awareness at an almost physical level as if the the space between the pages where the authors ideas are laid out and my reading of their pages has become porous and a continual flow happens between all three, an exchange not unlike the one that happens in the deepest tissues of the respiratory system when we breathe in and out. In perhaps the most obvious parallel between the two books I've been reading and my own life, the hero of The Magic Mountain and the Narrator of Proust\u2019s A la recherche du temps perdu,  both suffer from respiration related diseases. Proust\u2019s Narrator, an asthmatic like myself, spends portions of his life \u00e0 l\u2019horizontale, wrapped in the tissued softness of a curtained room, lest any noxious air disturb the normal rhythm of his breathing. Quite early in his stay at the Berghof sanitorium, Hans Castorp discovers that he may have a soft spot on his lung and this discovery removes him from the normal rhythms of life to live his own horizontal version of \u2018lost time\u2019 in the hermetic world of The Magic Mountain. The exchanges that take place between the two books might also be compared to those produced by the vibrating membrane of the acoustic chamber of a gramophone - since music plays such a big part in both works even as it does in my own life. Certain pieces of music become significant in both books, and are used by their authors as a kind of recurring theme. Schubert\u2019s Am Brunnen vor dem Tore, a song about the symbolic linden tree, emerges as a connector between Hans Castorp\u2019s feelings and ideas, and as a significant object in the working out of his life and fate. Mann also uses other pieces of music as metaphors for his hero\u2019s existence: just as Radomes in the opera Aida sings Tu - in questa tomba when Aida comes to him in his underground prison, Castorp is \u2018buried\u2019 in the tomb of the Berghof sanatorium, waiting to be joined by his love. But like Don Jos\u00e9 in Bizet\u2019s Carmen, Castorp\u2019s Russian \u2018Carmen\u2019 is drawn away from him towards a more \u2018robust\u2019 toreador. However, Castorp, although ein Sorgenkind des Lebens, one of life\u2019s problem children, is never at a complete loss and, without any operatic drama, he subtly vanquishes the toreador.Music is therefore a powerful trigger for change in Castorp\u2019s life but, as is the case in Proust, it is only one of a series of cathartic mechanisms: a simple nosebleed propels Castorp back in time to a significant moment in his childhood; the experience of being lost in a snow storm on the mountain awakens new levels of consciousness within him; dreams play a role too, as do images, in particular the x-ray image of his own body which provides a eureka moment in terms of his self discovery, his \u2018Bildung\u2019.Hans follows many avenues of study in his quest to understand himself, one of them being the lectures given every week in the sanatorium by Dr Krokowski on the subject of love as a force conducive to illness. Among the arcane topics covered by the doctor is The Arabian Nights: Tales from a Thousand and One Nights. This work was a favourite of Proust, and love as a force conducive to illness is itself an underlying theme in \u00c0 la Recherche du Temps Perdu. Dr Krokowkski also talks about plants in connection with love, in particular the morel mushroom. Proust chooses the name Morel for one of his characters, a character himself associated with the destructive power of love. The study of plants becomes a preoccupation for Hans in his personal program for self cultivation. He is particularly interested in the family of flowers called ranunculacae, a compound flower, as I recall, an especially charming plant, bisexual... This is yet another similarity with Proust\u2019s work since the metaphor of bisexual and self-fertilising plants is an important element in the Recherche.There are other parallels too, 'love' meaning \u2018being loved\u2019, references to duels, the personification of death, death wearing a starched Spanish ruff..whereas life always wore a little, normal, modern collar.Proust and Mann place themselves in the text from time to time, acknowledging the reader reading, At the beginning of May (for May arrived while we were talking about snowdrops) ..., the \u2018we\u2019 being the author and the reader.They both have very sharp observational skills as if they had taken a quick snapshot of a glance, a way of sitting or standing, a way of walking, and they can stretch description almost to the point of caricature as in the case of Dr Behrens or Mme Verdurin. The authors also make frequent diversions within their narratives but seem to finish up exactly where they planned in the end, with a discussion of \u2018Time\u2019.Thomas Mann has some very interesting things to say about the element of \u2018time\u2019 in narration, the very cornerstone of Proust\u2019s work.Narrative, however, has two kinds of time: first, its own real time, which like musical time defines its movement and presentation; and second, the time of its contents, which has a perspective quality that can vary widely, from a story in which the narrative\u2019s imaginary time is almost, or indeed totally coincident with its musical time, to one in which it stretches out over light-years.He can stretch a moment out of all proportion to real time: Their eyes met.. Claudia's napkin slips towards the floor - Hans Castorp half rises as if to pick it up it - but she retrieves it, scowls in annoyance at her own silly panic and turns away with a smile. That brief incident takes half a page to tell but at other times, Mann can condense years into a single sentence: There is not that much time left in any case, it's rushing by slapdash as it is, or if that's too noisy a way of putting it, it's whisking past hurry-scurry.Because the weather on the Magic Mountain is unpredictible with snow in summer and sunshine in winter, robbing the year of its seasons, Hans Castorp marks the passage of time not by calendars or watches but simply by his visits to the barber or the frequency with which he clips his nails - and since death is a major theme, as it is also in Proust, Mann reminds the reader more than once that, In the end it is only the physical that remains, the nails and the hair. Hans Castorp lives outside of time while on the Magic Mountain just as Proust\u2019s Narrator moves outside of time, en dehors du temps in his search for le Temps Perdu."}, {"userName": "Lee", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90786-lee", "userReview": "In 1997, in Jamaica Plain, Boston, ~4 am, mid-June, after a college friend's band that was blowing up at the time played the Middle East and everyone afterwards came back to our place, I remember a coolish girl on our porch saying to me something like \"Oh, you like to read? I bet you like boring shit like The Magic Mountain.\" I don't remember my response but since then whenever I've thought of this book I've flashed to that scene and her assumption that only pretentious little fuckers read books like this. Now, if I time-traveled back to Boston that night (the sun was just barely up, actually -- early summer dawn comes around 4 am) I'd change her mind about me and The Magic Mountain with enthusiastic description of how the book was boring at times, sure, totally intentionally boring at times, I'd say, but shit it's most certainly not. Sure, it's so slow at first it seems like a chore, but I think in fact it's also a mountainous testament to the importance of writerly/readerly patience, more than it's a \"magical\" read. It didn't get going for me until 330 freaking pages in (706 total). Turns out Mann ain't Musil* -- he's more like a superintellectual Stendhal or, at his best, matches the vivid prose and encompassing scope of Tolstoy. Formally steady pre-modernist approach: no real structural or extended language-y experimentation (other than a 17-page essay on the connection between cellular structure and galaxies). Content-wise, every page seems infused with intellectual talk -- it's explicitly hyper-thematic, a novel of ideas in which the major conflicts are theoretical, a novel that climaxes with a confounding blizzard of argument between opposing intellectuals (\"Operationes Spirtuales,\" p 432-460) followed by a sublime chapter (\"Snow,\" p 460-489) in which the main dude Hans sets out for some solo skiing and gets lost in an actual blizzard of wind-driven snow that gives way to abstractions and hallucinations, like how conflicting theories about Progress or Spirit or the necessity of terror or humaneness are manifested in reality -- first, escalating into real physical conflict between the two intellectual adversaries (the humanist Settembrini and the protofascist Naphta) and then later on real physical conflict among nations driven to war by ideas: \"What? Ideas, simply because they were rigorous, led inexorably to bestial deeds, to a settlement by physical struggle?\" Overall, I'd award three stars for maybe 600 total pages of this and nine stars for another scattered 106 pages, mostly during three parts: 1) the Mardi Gras bit (\"Danse Macabre\") in which italicized English indicates French is spoken, 2) the aforementioned chapter called \"Snow\" and much of the chapter before it that introduces Naphta's horrific backstory (note: freaking Naphta doesn't appear until page 367 -- try getting away with that these days, writer friends -- also, reviews on here mentioning a certain Herr Naphta helped me make it through the first 300+ pages since it was clear that a major character was yet to appear), and 3) the riveting final 20 pages or so (really gets going on page 686 - won't give things away). All in all, things seem intentionally shaped like an arduous ascent in itself. It's a novel that knows it's arduous, trying to induce irregular, elastic experiences of time in readers similiar to those of the characters (time is one of the novel's major themes; its elaboration/presentation here kicks the crap outta -- ahem, ahem -- recent pulitizer winners** also concerned with time). It's a novel that tries to induce a confounded sense in readers, too, erring on the side of a sort of highly managed confusion intermixed with occasional passages of extreme clarity (eg, at one point there's a description of moments when the sides of mountains all around can be seen through temporary openings in the clouds). It's structured like an upwardly undulating slope that ends sort of in open air. The language is always accessible but it's rarely propelled by a narrative engine running on high-viscosity plot. For the most part, the plot involves questions like: Will Hans get sick? Will Hans stay long? Will Hans get the girl he likes? Will Settembrini or Naptha win the struggle for Hans' burgeoning intellectual soul? Will Hans get sicker and die and or freakin' leave this jawn, healthy or not? It's sort of like Paradise Lost, where their sickness (moist spots) and their actual/theoretical removal from the flatlands is their innocence, and Hans over the course of his time on the mountain must awake from his stuporous dream-life where he plays king while expertly wrapped in blankets and waxes about the stars and weighs various philosophies including one involving the supremacy of emotions over the intellect (imagined Pepperkorn in the film played by none other than Don Quixote). Thought about handing out four stars (ye olde 4.5 rounded down) but that seemed more about my restlessness not always dealing with the novel's requirements of audacious readerly patience, not to mention its somewhat underdrawn minor characters, the semi-hokey thing about Hans's unrequited love for a semi-Asiatic pretty boy in grade school he revisits with an alluring lady with similarly slanty eyes and pale skin. Not really a book with many favorable female characters other than one sort of protoliberated object of Hans' lust known for slamming doors. In general, felt like a month-long vacation somewhere I often wanted to leave that nevertheless offered dramatic experiences and vistas and insight. Now I'm glad to be home -- I really look forward to reading a few quicker, easier, shorter books in a row -- but also I feel like the effort was totally rewarded, especially in the last twenty pages. I'd recommend the experience of this book to anyone with ample patience or, better yet, anyone interested in trying to slowly but surely overcome their readerly ADD; everyone else, make sure to read the chapter called \"Snow,\" just under thirty of the finest/most vivid pages I can remember reading in my life here in the flatlands, pages I'm sure to read many more times. Anyway, a major mess-with-me-not weapon to wield against those who argue against the presence of ideas in fiction. Highly recommended to pretentious little fuckers everywhere, of any age over 30 (if younger, I'd wait to read it).(A note on names -- Naptha's name seems to relate to naphtha: \"Naphtha normally refers to a number of flammable liquid mixtures of hydrocarbons . . . It is a broad term covering among the lightest and most volatile fractions of the liquid hydrocarbons in petroleum. Naphtha is a colorless to reddish-brown volatile aromatic liquid, very similar to gasoline.\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naphtha)* The Man Without Qualities Vol. 1: A Sort of Introduction and Pseudo Reality Prevails by Robert Musil is different in tone, particularly, and for me was more enjoyable/superior throughout, more open and humorous, and somehow also seemed much less dense.** Recent Pulitzer winners concerned with \"time\": A Visit from the Goon Squad; Tinkers"}, {"userName": "Dolors", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors", "userReview": "Impressions on my first reading of \"The Magic Mountain\" in 2009. Before GR I finished this over-long book and I can only say I am not prepared to read it again, even if Thomas Mann himself asked me in person.A complex book, philosophy, history and politics all mixed up with symbolism and irony. The author plays with the perception of time and the reader loses touch with reality. A swayed main character, too much of vain discourse and little sense.I won't deny the singularity of the work, but I can't say I enjoyed it. My mind must be too plain to follow this kind of argument, I'll leave it for others to enjoy, I'll turn to something quite different. Impressions on my second reading in 2013. After GR In spite of my headstrong resolution, when GR crossed my path, I forgot all about my self-made promises and decided to embark on a second literary journey with this novel participating in the Thomas Mann Group Reading. I have tried to write a more detailed account of my thoughts on this second reading.Reading \u201cThe Magic Mountain\u201d for a second time has proved to be a ponderous challenge to me. The same Thomas Mann recommends to read his novel not once but twice in his afterword, comparing the experience of a second reading with the necessity of knowing a piece of music to fully appreciate each note, which will lead to a thorough enjoyment of the apparently separate movements that compose a symphony.Thomas Mann considered music as the quintessential art. It\u2019s no coincidence therefore that his most brilliant writing style appears in glorious if brief moments where the triumph of music gets its peak of expression in equaling the narration to a melodious symphony. The chapters  \u201cSnow\u201d  and  \u201cFullness of Harmony\u201d are clear examples of Mann\u2019s genius in shrouding the human spirit with the beauty of art.Apart from paying tribute to art as a form of the purest embodiment of the complexities of humankind,  \u201cThe Magic Mountain\u201d  arises as a powerful metaphor that serves Mann to draw a masterful portrait of the archetypes of the bourgeois class and the aristocracy of the nineteenth century, of their ideals, morals and values that will commingle with the social and political tensions that would eventually make of the forthcoming century a devastating and turbulent episode in the world history.The reader is painfully slowly introduced to these higher reflections through the portrayal of the life in a tuberculosis sanatorium placed at the top of a mountain in Davos where the young engineer Hans Castorp, model of the refined and educated man of the nineteenth century, visits his cousin Joachim Ziemssen for seven days. Being helplessly drawn to the eerie allurement of this otherworldly and timeless spot, Hans ends up staying seven years instead. That Hans spends precisely that amount of time in this Alpine haven isn\u2019t fortuitous either, seven being known to be the number of creation, representing the vivid but controversial relationship between the human and the Divine, between the delicate line that separates life from death.My main misgiving with this undeniable literary masterpiece falls upon the false impression of the story being an outstanding work of magical realism that can be drawn from its first chapters only to witness the thick veil of artifice irremediably drawn creating a blurred atmosphere almost theatrical.Mann\u2019s protagonists end up being the result of an archetypical characterization, becoming mere puppets strongly caricaturized in wooden scenario and cardboard mountains. Each puppet dresses in bright and vivid color according to their attitude towards existence, philosophy, politics or art, giving voice to Mann\u2019s own controversial ideas:Hans Castorp: Or life\u2019s delicate child. Main character whose main feature is his hunger for knowledge. Hans\u2019 personality is very impressionable especially due to his bourgeois heritage and practical occupation as an engineer which makes of him a pristine character in existential and philosophical matters.Joachim Ziemssen: Hans\u2019 cousin and his inseparable companion. Ziemssen embodies the military values, especially the sense of duty as opposed to Castrop\u2019s approach as a civil who doesn\u2019t feel the call of honor and collective responsibility.The Italian Settembrini: My most favorite and complex character, full of inner contradictions and existential wonder. Settembrini could be defined as Castorp\u2019s fatherly mentor who defends the humanistic tradition, the values of democracy and of the Enlightenment with particular emphasis on tolerance and human rights, reaffirming in productive work, creative activity and active life as the main sources for the progress of mankind. Leo Naphta: Settembrini\u2019s antagonist and rival to capture young Hans\u2019 attention. Naptha is the fastidious voice in the story, a nostalgic of medieval order, defender of radical extremes, from totalitarian systems to anarchism or communism. He possesses great skill in dialectic and rhetoric as any consummated sophist. Russian Mme.Chauchat: Hans\u2019 platonic love and symbol of sensual desire. Her Asiatic features and slanted eyes remind Hans of Pribislav Hippe, a schoolmate to whom he felt strongly attracted as a child. The question of homosexuality or even bisexuality is most evident in the way Hans links these two characters as well as in the silent and hostile rivalry between Settembrini and Mme.Chauchat. Mynheer Peeperkorn: Mme.Chauchat\u2019s lover. He represents the ability to feel and enjoy life intensely, conversely to the intellectualism of Naphta and Settembrini. Hans\u2019 develops an intense friendship with the old man, bringing the subject of homosexuality to attention once again.In the end, each one of the characters, no matter the ideas they represent, have to face the mystery of time, life and death. Beauty is of little consequence.Time is the undisclosed but ever present character of the narrative. Time, an element of music, measuring its form and structure giving rhythm and pace and climax to the written score.Time inextricably linked to life, like bodies in space, moving relentlessly towards an unavoidable destiny, highlighting the insignificance of humankind.Time as an abstract concept which can\u2019t be measured in seven weeks, seven years or in a second on a battlefield amidst chaos, muddy blood and breaking voices that sing Schubert\u2019s \"Der Lindenbaum\" as a mourning hymn in the view of death.\u201dWe should not care to set high stake on thy life by the time it ends.\u201dSays Thomas Mann in his afterword. Indeed. But there\u2019s an echo nagging at the back of my consciousness that repeats \u201cwhere is the joy of life if we don\u2019t\u201d?This is a timeless classic, maybe one of the most influential pieces of written art in the twentieth century, finely formed, filled with myriad reflections of the highest order, irony and satire but, even with overflowing written musicality, the novel has failed for a second time to strike the right chord in the symphony which is eternally played in my plain but complex soul.*******Note: May I draw your attention to my GR talented friend Samadrita\u2019s outstanding review, which reflects what I haven\u2019t been able to put into words in my own attempt at writing one."}, {"userName": "Fernando", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7665532-fernando", "userReview": "Thomas Mann es considerado uno de los m\u00e1s gloriosos escritores alemanes y uno de los mejores a los que uno puede acercarse en la literatura. Sus obras son ya cl\u00e1sicas y de un prestigio irreprochables. Ha escrito novelas realmente extensas (esta es una de ellas), pero tambi\u00e9n cuentos y ensayos.Mi acercamiento a \u00e9l fue leyendo primero su exquisita nouvelle \"La muerte en Venecia\" de corte netamente rom\u00e1ntico y un cuento maravilloso llamado \"Mario y el mago\", pero quer\u00eda realmente descubrir por qu\u00e9 esta novela, \"La monta\u00f1a m\u00e1gica\" ha tenido y sigue teniendo un brillo y una admiraci\u00f3n tan apabullante en los lectores de todas las \u00e9pocas desde su publicaci\u00f3n en 1924.Realmente no me defraud\u00f3 y reafirm\u00f3 mi admiraci\u00f3n y respeto hacia Mann, ganador del Premio Nobel de Literatura en 1929, ya que yo tambi\u00e9n sucumb\u00ed a sus encantos literarios y a su poderosa narrativa. Seguramente continuar\u00e9 con \"Doktor Faustus\" en breve.\"La monta\u00f1a m\u00e1gica\" es una obra colosal, descomunal y el ascenso del lector posee el mismo tenor que el de esa monta\u00f1a enclavada en la localidad de Davos, pero sin tornarse dif\u00edcil o pesado, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de que por momentos la densidad y especialmente la extensi\u00f3n de los cap\u00edtulos generan que el \u00e9ste necesite tomarse todo el tiempo posible para recorrer sus p\u00e1ginas.Es una de las novelas m\u00e1s largas que he le\u00eddo. Consta de 1.050 p\u00e1ginas y tiene much\u00edsima tela para cortar a partir de lo vasto de los temas tratados en ella. Es como un gran compendio de artes, humanidades, filosof\u00eda e historia por nombrar algunas tem\u00e1ticas pero se centra en dos cuestiones fundamentales: la enfermedad y la muerte.En torno a estas dos cuestiones se desarrolla en su totalidad el argumento de la novela, porque tienen una implicancia directa en Hans Castorp, su protagonista y de todos los que comparten sus vidas en el famoso sanatorio de Berghof. Todos van all\u00ed a curarse de sus afecciones que redundan usualmente en problemas respiratorios, de tuberculosis, de pulmones a punto de estallar y otras enfermedades similares. La majestuosa monta\u00f1a donde est\u00e1 enclavado propio sanatorio Berghof, con su clima y si entorno le aportan las condiciones a la salud de los pacientes: \"Aquel aire era capaz de curar todas la enfermedades latentes en el cuerpo del hombre, aunque comenzaba por hacerlas brotar, provocaba una especia de revoluci\u00f3n org\u00e1nica que desemboca en una euf\u00f3rica explosi\u00f3n de la enfermedad, por as\u00ed decirlo.\"De alguna manera, el ambiente que los cobija para recuperarlos, les aporta complicaciones que logran hacer que el paciente tenga que quedarse all\u00ed por meses.La acci\u00f3n transcurre desde 1907 hasta 1914. Incre\u00edblemente, Hans Castorp, que llega a ese sanatorio construido a casi dos mil metros de altitud para visitar a su primo Joachim Ziemssen para pasar tres agradables semanas, terminar\u00e1 viviendo siete a\u00f1os ya como un paciente m\u00e1s. Junto con Joachim conoceremos a los m\u00e1s variados personajes, todos ellos extremadamente particulares y queribles. R\u00e1pidamente el lector se encari\u00f1ar\u00e1 con algunos, como el inefable humanista italiano Lodovico Settembrini, que tendr\u00e1 una preponderante influencia en Hans, a punto tal que se transformar\u00e1 en un padre para \u00e9l. Con una apasionada defensa de los valores, el humanismo, la tolerancia y la democracia ser\u00e1 un gu\u00eda y un referente en Hans Castorp.Tambi\u00e9n ir\u00e1n apareciendo otros no menos interesantes como la risue\u00f1a se\u00f1orita Herminie Kleefeld, madame Karoline St\u00f6hr con su \"ignorancia intelectual\" a cuestas, el ruso Ant\u00f3n Karlovich Ferge, la se\u00f1orita Engelhart, el se\u00f1or jocoso se\u00f1or Albin, la enfermera en jefe Adri\u00e1tica von Mylendonk, el trastornado Ferdinand Wehsal y la institutriz Robinson tambi\u00e9n. En fin, la lista de personajes es tan larga como la novela.Existen tres personajes m\u00e1s que tambi\u00e9n son clave en todo este asunto. En primer lugar, Clavdia Chauchat quien poco a poco ir\u00e1 transform\u00e1ndose en el objetivo amoroso de Hans que en un principio es plat\u00f3nico hasta que se vuelve real y tangible. Junto con Clavdia nos encontraremos con otro personaje fundamental llamado Mynheer Peeperkorn y quien Mann le concede tres cap\u00edtulos completos, dado que de un modo distinto a Settembrini lograr\u00e1 hacer efecto en Hans Castorp porque adem\u00e1s, quedan incluidos en un tri\u00e1ngulo amoroso m\u00e1s que complejo.Otro de ellos es Leo Naptha, un intelectual jud\u00edo, que procede de una orden jesuita, especializado en la Edad Media que ser\u00e1 la ant\u00edtesis del se\u00f1or Settembrini. Entre estos dos se generar\u00e1 una pugna eterna, que incluye largu\u00edsimas discusiones y entreveros de alto vuelo intelectual y filos\u00f3fico que desnudan sus posiciones completamente antag\u00f3nicas hasta estallar de la peor forma al final de la novela.Todas estas batallas intelectuales demostrar\u00e1n el poder\u00edo filos\u00f3fico de Thomas Mann. Maneja ambos planteamientos de ideales con una precisi\u00f3n y una brillantez impecable, porque logra penetrar en la psiquis de cada personaje y los controla por completo, tal vez no al nivel de un Dostoievski, pero s\u00ed con un aplomo incuestionable. Son muchos los temas que este autor plantea en el libro y en todos ellos lo hace sin fisuras. Realmente destacable.Volviendo a la cuesti\u00f3n de la enfermedad y la muerte, el cual es harto desarrollado en el libro, creo que para que ellos tengan efecto fue necesario incluir algo que tal vez algunos lectores pasa por alto: leyendo las distintas situaciones noto que la gran mayor\u00eda de los enfermos del sanatorio son presa de una hipocondr\u00eda galopante y lo que es peor, eso es sustentado y alimentado por los mismos doctores, Behrens que es el m\u00e9dico principal y su ayudante, el doctor Krokovski. Entre los dos, de alguna manera se dan ma\u00f1a para mantener a los pacientes por m\u00e1s tiempo del que tienen estipulado. Tal vez yo veo algo que otros no, pero me ha dado una fuerte impresi\u00f3n esto de c\u00f3mo manejan la enfermedad de sus pacientes, as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n como el tratamiento del asunto de la muerte y c\u00f3mo afrontarla. He tomado nota de muchas frases y reflexiones acerca de la muerte y a muchos lo inclu\u00ed en los avances de lectura, dado que Mann aborda a la muerte desde todos los puntos de vista posibles.En un determinado punto llegamos a algunos factores que los pacientes que se autodenominan \"Los de arriba\" sostienen contra el mundo de \"los que viven abajo\". En primer lugar el tratamiento que se le da al tiempo. Mann se toma gran parte de un cap\u00edtulo para explicar con qu\u00e9 diferencia transcurre el tiempo en el sanatorio en contraposici\u00f3n con el tiempo supuestamente \"normal\" de los habitantes Davos, incluso afirmando que todo sucede de una manera distinta. A punto tal que uno lo termina creyendo.En segundo lugar la cuesti\u00f3n de la enfermedad. Se llega a un momento en que ninguno de los pacientes puede afirmar que se podr\u00e1 ir del sanatorio, puesto que su enfermedad es tomada como un modo de vida. El mundo \"de abajo\" goza de buena salud pero ellos, nunca la podr\u00e1n recobrar. A todo esto se suma la influencia de los doctores Behrens y Krokovski a quienes Settembrini apoda como Minos y Radamante, que son los jueces de los muertos en el Reino de las Sombras. Simbolismos como estos aparecer\u00e1n continuamente en distintos cap\u00edtulos de la novela.Una novela tan extensa da posibilidades a incluir todo tipo de situaciones completamente dis\u00edmiles y esta no es la excepci\u00f3n. Desde la carnavalizaci\u00f3n bajtiniana que nos regala en una aut\u00e9ntica fiesta de disfraces que se realiza en el sal\u00f3n principal del sanatorio hasta el cap\u00edtulo denominado \"Noche de Walpurgis\", al mejor estilo del Fausto de Goethe en donde Hans ser\u00e1 llevado a conocer el costado m\u00e1s exc\u00e9ntrico de sus compa\u00f1eros del sanatorio.Por otro lado y como comentara previamente, el alto vuelo po\u00e9tico de Settembrini es algo que engalana y enriquece a la historia. Es un placer leer algunas de las cosas que dice porque nos hace pensar, reflexionar y so\u00f1ar. Algo parecido sucede con Mynheer Peeperkorn, aunque su sabidur\u00eda posee otros componentes distintos a los de Settembrini y a\u00fan as\u00ed terminan haciendo tremenda mella en Hans, hasta llegar a eclipsar a Settembrini.Creo que hay varios momentos clave en esta novela. Para m\u00ed son la llegada de Hans Castorp al sanatorio, luego el descubrimiento de su enfermedad, sus peripecias con Madame Chauchat, la aparici\u00f3n de Leo Naptha que cambiar\u00e1 la percepci\u00f3n de Hans sobre la vida, la ida de Joachim para cumplir su sue\u00f1o de enrolarse en el ej\u00e9rcito, la introducci\u00f3n de la novela de Mynheer Peeperkorn y el final, que involucra a varios personajes como Joachim, Settembrini, Naptha, Peeperkorn y obviamente, al mismo Hans.\"La monta\u00f1a m\u00e1gica\" es el fiel retrato de una \u00e9poca casi m\u00e1gica tambi\u00e9n: la de principios del siglo XX cuando el mundo, distra\u00eddo y absorto en sus propios placeres recibir\u00eda una feroz bofetada a partir del asesinato del archiduque de Prusia, Franz Ferdinand que desencadenar\u00eda la Primera Guerra Mundial. Ya nada iba a ser lo mismo para Hans y para el mundo. Lo bello, lo m\u00e1gico, lo fascinante desaparecer\u00e1 completamente y otra ser\u00e1 la realidad de Europa.Para lograr este efecto final, Mann primeramente nos sumerge en este sanatorio tan particular, poblado de personajes tan maravillosos e inolvidables logrando que el lector escale esta monta\u00f1a sin dificultad alguna y cr\u00e9anme que no es nada f\u00e1cil lograr que en una novela tan extensa el inter\u00e9s decaiga. Solo los grandes maestros como Thomas Mann pueden cumplir estas expectativas de una manera tan excepcional.Por \u00faltimo, debo reconocer que en cierta forma, me sorprendi\u00f3 gratamente el final dado que corta casi de un plumazo toda una realidad de siete a\u00f1os de forma abrupta para arrojarnos a un ambiente mucho peor y tr\u00e1gico y adem\u00e1s, he intentado tratar de recordar si existe otra novela de la manera que termina esta: Mann termina el p\u00e1rrafo final del libro con una pregunta. De la misma manera culmino yo mi rese\u00f1a: \u00bft\u00fa lector me ayudas a recordar otro libro que haya terminado as\u00ed?"}, {"userName": "Carmo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15850971-carmo", "userReview": "\u201cAdeus, Hans Castorp, filho ing\u00e9nuo e traquinas da vida!

It's been reviewed by many clever readers already, over several generations and sprawling continents. It hardly needs my support. I am just going to offer my entirely subjective comments about what a great and thoroughly enjoyable read it is.The plot should be familiar to Western readers by now, as this classic is a century old and much discussed in literary circles. However, in case you missed out, here's the synopsis from Goodreads:In this dizzyingly rich novel of ideas, Mann uses a sanatorium in the Swiss Alps, a community devoted exclusively to sickness, as a microcosm for Europe, which in the years before 1914 was already exhibiting the first symptoms of its own terminal irrationality. The Magic Mountain is a monumental work of erudition and irony, sexual tension, and intellectual ferment, a book that pulses with life in the midst of death.It took me ages to finish because I kept setting it aside to think about it and to write on colourful sticky notes, which now make my book twice as thick as it already was. I did not want to rush through my reading, so I allowed The Magic Mountain its own space in my life, reading it only when I could give it my full attention for several hours at a stretch, to the exclusion of everything else. In honour of the \"cure\"and to get a feel for Hans's setting, I often spent this time on our front balcony overlooking our garden and the gentle hills that make up our town. Alas, there were no great snows or high peaks, but it has its own kind of curative peace, nonetheless.It was necessary for me to stop reading from time to time, in order to ponder important questions, such as whether I am Team Naphta or Team Settembrini. Just kidding! There is only one right choice, of course, and I was always on side with the passionate Humanist, despite his dogmatism and (at times) overbearing manner. While I felt sad for Naphta's final solution, it was rather inevitable, and I have to admit to enormous relief that our fictional Italian ideologue survived the ordeal.This has to be the best Modern novel I've read. I love that Mann took on the entire Western world and all of our human concerns -- personal, social, existential, political, natural, theological, and artistic -- as the basis for his book. I love that he chose one rather impressionable but not overly impressive young man to be our un-heroic hero. Having said that, I must add that I believe that I thought more highly of Hans than Hans thought of himself, or perhaps than Mann thought of him. I did not find Hans to be such an ordinary young man at all, at least not by today's standards. Perhaps young European men were typically much cleverer and more personally restrained during that era, than our average young man today? I doubt it, though.It's fair to say that Hans is easily swayed by stronger personalities than his own. Because of this proclivity, he remains vulnerable and vacillating in his own philosophies as one who stands for nothing and so might fall for anything. Hans is not strong enough in himself to withstand peer pressure, even when he is appalled by the undertakings of those peers. Against his own better judgment, he participates in activities that are, by his own account, distasteful and sometimes dangerous and illegal (i.e. a degrading seance and an insane duel).And yet, I admired his sense of friendship and the way that he reflected on things, trying hard to make right choices. Mann really turns the coming-of-age tale on its head, though, as in the end, one expects Hans to be wiser, stronger, and more decisive in himself. In fact, what happens is that news of the war crashes through the protective walls of the Berghof, awakening Hans from his seven-year \"enchantment\" and propelling him off to battle, along with thousands of other young men.That Hans would join the war, whatever his thoughts and feelings on it (which we never know), was inevitable, too. As Settembrini says, explaining the necessity of the duel to Hans, \"Whoever is unable to offer his person, his arm, his blood, in service of the ideal, is unworthy of it; however intellectualized, it is the duty of a man to remain a man\" (p.700). So, in one of the finest and most subtle ironic twists I've read, ever, Hans's \"salvation\" from suspended animation at the Berghof comes by way, not of his healing, or his education by learned minds, or his experience in love and death and illness (all of which make up his life-but-not-life existence) but by an external inescapable catastrophe. Once again, Hans does not act upon life but reacts to it. It chooses him, as it chooses all his able-bodied peers. But of course, what we readers suspect is that it is most likely not life, but death which has chosen Hans, which has swept him off his mountain top and into its arms. We never know for sure.This novel is subtle and yet also straightforward, with a plot that is simple to follow and yet also complex and multi-layered. It's hilarious and serious and sometimes goes on and on about topics that make you question your devotion as a reader (i.e. pages and pages on the history and practice of Freemasonry). I marvel at how any writer could write characters like these, who are each representing a particular worldview and high-flung ideals, and yet who come across as real people rather than allegorical stand-ins for human beings. When we take our leave of each of the august personages who haunt the Berghof, we feel the loss of a relationship that mattered to us. That was my experience, anyway, as I said goodbye to Joachim, to Peeperkorn, to Claudia, and then, finally, to Settembrini and Hans himself.It's fascinating and a bit sad to realise that many of the big topics the Europeans were grappling with a hundred years ago are still relevant today, and not only the existential ones: most especially, humanism versus radicalism. Clearly, we haven't resolved this yet, and it seems only to be getting worse if we judge by recent events.I will re-read The Magic Mountain because I feel there is much to learn from it and that a second reading is not only desirable but also necessary to even begin to grasp it all. Also, I will no doubt be missing my friends at the Berghof by then."}, {"userName": "Geoff", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126266-geoff", "userReview": "~~~\u201cThe Hamlet of Europe now looks upon millions of ghosts\u201d Paul Valery wrote. Elsinore is everywhere. \u201cThe time is out of joint\u201d spoke Hamlet. And he gazed at laughing skulls and procrastinated and made colloquies with ghosts within the walls his cliffside castle. Hans Castorp also waits, lingers, decides not to decide, dallies with whether it is better to be or not to be, listens to his attendant spirits, weighs skulls in the palm of his hand while time pulses around him on great heights. But The Magic Mountain isn\u2019t only Hamlet, it is also Bottom\u2019s dream across a long midsummer night, and the enchantment of somnambulistic illusions. It is a winter\u2019s tale, too. 1,001 Alpen N\u00e4chte. And Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle, which might flow out in waves on this purified mountain air from a coffin-shaped black cabinet with an inset gramophone, over which our hero holds his head in his hands for nights on end. And the record spins, and the needle traces its eternal groove as the opera unfolds to its finis- Time\u2019s straight line is elastic at all points and so folds into a circle on which the needle hums as it reads its grainy text and moves toward its center, only to be lifted and turned, reset by some unseen hand or shade of hand- and so the cycle, the opera, the aria, the story resumes its inward path on waves of sorrowful music. Does the needle know, as it moves along its course, where it might be, temporally, narratively, in our opera? Or does it lose itself by being bound within and not outside of this this strange method of capturing and reading Time? Yet we measure this boundless sea of Time as if each wave was not retreating from us and coming at us simultaneously, and so was not ungraspable- by the shore of Time sand is collected and placed into a glass funnel, it is pulled down through the hourglass by gravity and in the bottom bell of the hourglass a mountain slowly takes shape.But \u201cthe time is out of joint\u201d, and we might find that as we come to feel ever more confident in our watches and hourglasses, the bell tower in the center of town and the winding face at the train station, to our astonishment we may look up one evening into the dome of sky and see both the sun and moon sharing our heaven, a dual claim on our sensibilities, the sky both studded with stars and washed with daylight\u2019s pallid glow. Fantastical things occur to people when the time is out of joint. And those living within the flux and flex of timeless time also become fantastic, phantasmal. Illness takes hold. Great stupor and great petulance infect our population at these heights. For we\u2019ve climbed above the world to look down into that bottom bell of the hourglass, where the sands of time are forming this mountain in miniature, this sickly dreaming, encapsulated world which grows and grows as time accumulates, grows and grows until it covers all of Elsinore, all of Europe, all the world. As if Time were a lung in a chest opened for us to watch, on an x-ray machine perhaps, as it expands and contracts- we are aware that each expansion and contraction is a kind of counting down for the biological organism- but for the breather, what good would counting breaths do, but become another way of ticking out individuated moments moving us closer to the final great cataclysm? And for our Hans Castorp, our cipher for the haunted and harried epoch through which he chose to dwell outside of time - do we blame him for so long posing the question of \u201cto be or not to be?\u201d - when the terrible answer to that question was inexorably approaching, like an avenging angel, all the time anyway?An infinite book, this \u201ctime novel\u201d.

The magic mountain symbolizes a community detached from the flatland, the normal values, duties, history, time, indulging in its physical closeness to and spiritual longing for sickness and death. Hans Castorp, after entering into this fatigued, detached, and self-perpetuating community, became increasingly obsessed with the romanticism of sickness and death, which he considered noble. Mann not only associated sickness death with decay, sensuality and love (\"all love is only disease transformed\"), but also with knowledge and intellect, a theme also explored in Death in Venice. The death of Hans' cousin Joachim Ziemssen (who symbolizes tradition value and duty, and asserts that opinions don't matter as long as one is a decent chap) in the incredibly touching chapter A Soldier, And Brave, marked a turning point for Hans' fascination with death, revealed to him the moral seriousness of death and the strength of piety and duty against death (\"For two things were unmistakable: first, that Joachim was approaching death in full consciousness, and second, that he consented to his state, and was in harmony with himself.\") In the chapter Snow, Hans made a choice between life and death, declaring that \"For the sake of goodness and love, man shall let death have no sovereignty over his thoughts. And with this\u2014I awake.\" Only what is life-worthy is love-worthy, and is honorable. Hans Castorp finally returns to the flatland, to redeem respect for duty/tradition/mediocrity, and to eventually die in the Great War, perish in the universal feast of death with the same consciousness and harmony that Joachim had. There is a sense that this mediocre fate suits Hans Castorp well, who Mann also characterizes as mediocre, \"though in an entirely honorable sense.\"The Magic Mountain is like a encyclopedia for the divisive forces on European continent before WWI (romanticism vs. rationalism, conservative vs. liberal, etc.) What I especially love about it is that those binary oppositions are not clear-cut, and other themes permeate them, enrich them, and eventually shatter them. Mann reveals to us that both sides are pedagogues, and the quarrels are nothing but a battle of noise. But in the end something might out of this war: \"Out of this universal feast of death, out of this extremity of fever, kindling the rain-washed evening sky to a fiery glow, may it be that love one day shall mount?\" A timeless masterpiece!"}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex", "userReview": "Wimps in the MistTime is not a constant, said Einstein in 1916, and his fellow German Thomas Mann was like whoa. Eight years later he finished Magic Mountain, which proves that time is relative by making the experience of reading it last fucking forever.Here is the \"plot\": Young Hans Castorp has found that he doesn't enjoy having a job, or anything else about life, so when he ambles up a mountain to visit his consumptive cousin Joachim who does nothing but sit around wrapped in a blanket all day, he decides to stay. \"This is the life!\" he says. \"I'm sick too! Wrap me up!\"Castorp is a nincompoop - that's the narrator's word, or I suppose the translator's - and the high points of his action in this 700-page book consist of borrowing a pencil and getting lost. He exists to listen to the debate Mann is really interested in: between humanism, represented by Settembrini, and fascism, represented by Naphta. The debate may seem academic but it has dire repercussions for your life, because reading it will make you so bored.These two bloviating asshats stand for the two sides in World War I, and the nicest thing you can say about this book is that it didn't go over super well with Nazis. They treated Mann with kid gloves for a while - he won the Nobel Prize in 1929, after all - but he would eventually have his German citizenship revoked. He spent the rest of his life in Switzerland and America. He was an interesting dude: bisexual and atheist, both of which are themes explored in this novel, not in an interesting way. Castorp's love interest Clavdia Chauchat - literally \"hot pussy\" - is, Orlandoish, the resexed reincarnation of Castorp's youthful male love interest Pribislav. Both of them will loan Castorp what may be the same pencil, which is as interesting as a pencil can be, which is not at all.As for God, Settembrini represents science and Naptha, the bad guy, represents religion: \"It seems to me you have to be clear about these two intellectual directions, or dispositions...the religious and the free-thinking,\" Castorp says. But Mann doesn't want you to actually take sides.They carried everything to extremes, these two...and squabbled fiercely over the most extreme choices, whereas it seemed to him that what one might, in a spirit of conciliation, declare truly human or humane had to lie somewhere in the middle of this intolerant contentiousness, somewhere between rhetorical humanism and illiterate barbarism.His point is that any philosophy taken to extreme is false; he advocates compromise and restraint. Anyway, the point is that Thomas Mann was interesting but his book isn't. It's so fucking boring. There are no characters and there is no plot. There are talking heads with names, but they exist only to blather at each other. Almost nothing happens. Time stretches endlessly around you as you slog through page upon page of talking and talking. You look up and an hour has passed, but you're only four pages further on. What happened to all those minutes? Will you ever get them back? Will you emerge from reading this book like Rip Van Winkle, your child grown, your spouse dead? \"There is nothing 'actual' about time,\" says Hans Castorp. \"If it seems long to you, then it is long, and if it seems to pass quickly, then it's short. But how long or short it is in actuality, no one knows.\" All I know is that it was very, very long while I read this book.tl;dr too long; don't read"}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "706.\tDer Zauberberg = The Magic Mountain, Thomas MannThe Magic Mountain (German: Der Zauberberg) is a novel by Thomas Mann, first published in November 1924.

John Woods), and without a doubt it is among the five best works of literature that I have ever read. Covering more than 700 densely-packed pages, it is not for the light of heart, but provides ample reward for the tenacious reader. Published in 1924 and winning the Nobel Prize for literature in 1929, The Magic Mountain should reside on your shelf next to The Brothers Karamazov, The Persian Letters, The Sorrows of Young Werther, and East of Eden.Part of why I found this novel so delightful was that I could closely relate to the ordeal of the protagonist, Hans Castorp, who as a young man finds himself unexpectedly confined to a hospital. In his case, he makes a trip to a sanatorium high in the Swiss Alps to visit his cousin. The patients are all receiving treatment for tuberculosis, and since most have been there for quite a long time, he finds himself in a very different culture than the \"flatlands\" from which he came. Just before leaving, Castorp asks for a physical exam to determine the cause of a fever which was plaguing him during his stay. But to his disappointment, the doctor finds that he has a mild case of tuberculosis himself! Our poor hero will be staying on for much longer than three weeks he had planned, and not as a guest, but as a patient.One of the most interesting themes in the novel is the treatment of time. Far up in the mountains, completely removed from the normal iterations of daily life, time takes on a different dimension. Each day is strictly regimented to best facilitate the recovery of patients. The residents move from bedroom, to dining hall, to outdoor \"rest cure,\" and back, in an utterly predictable manner. Far from what one might expect, this apparent tedium does not cause time to slow down, but rather speed up, since each day is nearly indiscernible from all others. Thus, Hans Castcorp learns, his original three week stay is hardly worth mentioning: up here, a month is the smallest measurable unit of time.Besides our hero, there are two other outstanding characters: Settembrini, a boisterous Italian literary humanist, and Naphta, a sharp-tonged communist Jesuit. Castorp takes on the role of student when listening to the rhetorical fireworks of these bombastic speakers. These three men, along with a cast of other patients with tuberculosis, fill hundreds of pages of fascinating narrative and dialog.

And, just like that of Hans Castorp when he entered the Berghotel Sanatorium Schatzalp which is the stage for the events of \u2018The Magic Mountain\u2019, the temperature of today\u2019s political world is also at an ambiguous 37.7 degrees - not quite high enough to call a fever but a little too high to call healthy as well.So in 2017 we have to ask: \u201cIs our politics sick?\u201d This is a difficult question to answer, but a few weeks of rest-cure might be just what our political institutions need. It is time to re-open the doors to the Berghotel Sanatorium Schatzalp, pull the dust sheets off the furniture, fumigate the rooms, replace the X-ray machine with an up-to-date MRI scanner and admit some brand new patients in need of medical assistance.Who will check into our Sanatorium in 2017? Who is our twenty first century Hans Castorp, our Everyman of the Internet Age ready to subject himself to the pedagogic guidance of a modern day Settembrini or risk exposure to the wild ravings of a twenty first century Naphta?I have a candidate. He is not a trainee engineer like our good Hans Castorp but he does his bit to support our industrial world in a job of symbolic importance equal to that of Hans\u2019 work on his shipping lines: he is a coal plant operator.Our candidate does not wear Hans\u2019 silk-lined summer-overcoat but rather a bright red sweater. He is not from Germanic Old Europe but rather from the New World. Yes, I think you know who I have in mind for our new Everyman, our new Hans Castorp, he is Ken Bone.A still picture of Ken Bone undergoing pedagogic instruction through his observation of a debate between a dedicated humanist and a charismatic ideologue.We have found our new Hans Castorp for a re-opened Sanatorium but where can we find our Naphta? This is, after all, the twenty first century where science and rational thought have progressed further than even Thomas Mann might have imagined back in 1924.Where can we find a politically extreme, raving ideologue who believes in the ultimate triumph of Judeo-Christian belief over a corrupt, secular society weakened by attachment to bourgeoisie Enlightenment values such as democracy, humanism and free speech? Surely, after having lead humanity into two world wars, such mad ideologues must be a little thin on the ground these days?Well, apparently not. In fact they are not that uncommon at all. We need only take a trip along Interstates 70, 68 and 69 from Ken Bone\u2019s home in St Loius to arrive in Washington DC and the office of \"Senior Counselor to the President\" to find our new Naphta in the person of Mister Stephen Bannon. Let us compare Bannon and Naphta\u2019s words, for their ideologies have a lot in common. Here is Naphta on the primacy of divine decree over a secular state that is a manifestation of evil\n\"...For even if the state\u2019s ungodliness were not branded on its brow, one need only note a simple historical fact\u2014that its origins can be traced to the will of the people and not, like those of the Church, to divine decree\u2014and thereby prove that the state is, if not exactly a manifestation of evil, then at least a manifestation of dire necessity and sinful shortcomings...\u201d\nAnd here is Bannon saying how Judeo-Christian capitalists brought greatness to the West and how \u201c\u2026working men and women\u2026\u201d are tired of the secular state telling them how to \u201c.. comport their lives\u2026\u201d. This speech was made by Bannon in the Vatican during a discussion of right wing Christian movements. Naphta, as a confirmed Jesuit, would have felt quite at home at the same meeting:\n\u201c\u2026capitalists were strong believers in the Judeo-Christian West. They were either active participants in the Jewish faith, they were active participants in the Christians\u2019 faith, and they took their beliefs, and the underpinnings of their beliefs was manifested in the work they did. And I think that\u2019s incredibly important and something that would really become unmooredI will tell you that the working men and women of Europe and Asia and the United States and Latin America don\u2019t believe that. They believe they know what\u2019s best for how they will comport their lives. They think they know best about how to raise their families and how to educate their families. So I think you\u2019re seeing a global reaction to centralized government, whether that government is in Beijing or that government is in Washington, DC, or that government is in Brussels. So we are the platform for the voice of that\u2026\u201d\nHere is Naphta in a more apocalyptic mood:\n\"...the Renaissance gave birth to what is known as liberalism, individualism, humanistic citizenship, and all that...[but]...your ideals came to an end long ago - those ideals are dead, or at best lie twitching in their death throes, and those whom they had hoped to finish off have got their foot in the door again...\"\nBannon can match Naphta\u2019s ravings without too much trouble. And just like Naphta when it comes to the start of a \u201c\u2026brutal and bloody conflict\u2026\u201d what he is really thinking is that he would love nothing more than to fire the first shot:\n\"...It was many, many years and decades of peace. And I believe we\u2019ve come partly off track in the years since the fall of the Soviet Union and we\u2019re starting now in the 21st century, which I believe, strongly, is a crisis both of our church, a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a crisis of capitalism. And we\u2019re at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict, of which if the people in this room, the people in the church, do not bind together and really form what I feel is an aspect of the church militant, to really be able to not just stand with our beliefs, but to fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that\u2019s starting, that will completely eradicate everything that we\u2019ve been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years...\"\nIt has to be said there are some differences between Bannon and Naphta. When it comes to torture Naphta holds nothing back:\nNaphta spoke out in favor of the bastinado. According to him, it was absurd to jabber on about the dignity of man in this instance, for our true dignity was based in the Spirit and not the flesh, and since the human soul was only too inclined to suck its entire love of life from the body, the administration of pain to the body was a highly commendable means by which to spoil the soul\u2019s desire for sensual pleasure and, as it were, drive it back out of the body and into the spiritual realm, thereby restoring the latter\u2019s dominion.\nIn contrast Bannon confines himself to editing a blog with articles in support of waterboarding and torture (at least for non-Christians) rather than advocating it quite so directly. Such restraint is known as \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d.We are doing well. The rooms of our re-opened twenty first century Berghof are filling up nicely. But where can we find a larger than life character to complement that lover of rich food and high living, Mynheer Peeperkorn?Where can we find a character that mesmerizes everyone despite nothing he says making any sense and who also has a keen eye for the young ladies? Mmm. Perhaps it is not so difficult to find someone to check in to the Royal Suite at the Berghof after all. I think you know who I have in mind \u2013 the great Orange One himself.Let\u2019s compare the Orange One\u2019s public utterances with those of Mynheer Peeperkorn. The Orange One can command the adulation of millions despite speaking utter gibberish:\n\"...Look, having nuclear\u2014my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart \u2014you know, if you're a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world\u2014it's true!\u2014but when you're a conservative Republican they try\u2014oh, do they do a number\u2014that's why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune\u2014you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we're a little disadvantaged\u2026\u201d:\nMuch like Mynheer Peeperkorn:\n\u201c\u2026\u2019Ladies and gentlemen. Fine. How very fine. That settles it. And you must keep in mind and never\u2014not for a moment \u2013 lose sight of the fact that \u2013 but enough on that topic. What is incumbent upon me to say is not so much that, but primarily and above all this: that we are duty bound, that we are charged with an inviolable- I repeat with all due emphasis-inviolable obligation-No! No, ladies and gentlemen, not that I, how very mistaken it would be to think that I \u2013 but that settle it ladies and gentlemen. Settles it completely. I know we are all of one mind, and so then, to the point!\u2019He had said nothing\u2026all of them, including eavesdropping Hans Castorp, believed that they had heard something very important or, to the extent that they were aware of the lack of anything communicated and of any thought completed, they simply did not miss it\u2026\u201d\nEven their hand gestures are the same, although Mynheer Peeperkorn\u2019s hands are that much larger:\n\u201c..a forefinger bent to form a circle with a thumb or a palm held out wide, but with tapering nails, to caution, to subdue, to demand attention, only to disappoint his now smiling, attentive listeners with one of this very robustly prepared, but incomprehensible phrases\u2026\u201d.\nSo something like this:We have filled another room in the Sanatorium. But what of Madame Chauchat? Who can be Ken Bone\u2019s love interest on our newly re-opened rest home on the Magic Mountain? What figure of womanhood can inspire such a mix of love and lust in our twenty first century Everyman? That at least is easy to answer: Jennifer Lawrence. In Ken Bone\u2019s own words:\n\u201c\u2026Maybe she should have been more careful with her pics, but the bad guys are still the ones who sought them out and looked at them. By which I mean guys like me. I saw her butt hole. I liked it\u2026.\u201d\nKen Bone, Stephen Bannon, the Orange One, Jennifer Lawrence. The rooms are filling up nicely, but there is still an important room that remains unfilled.Who is the Settembrini of 2017? Who will provide the pedagogic counterweight that our poor Ken Bone so badly needs to balance himself against the insane ravings of our new Naphta, our White House Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon? Well, unfortunately that room must remain vacant a little longer; at present there is no-one willing or able to fill that role. Telegrams have been sent to a certain Mr Sanders and Ms Warren to ask whether they would like to take up residence for the season but a reply is still awaited.There we have it. A new \u2018Magic Mountain\u2019 for 2017. I am worried about whether I can maintain my health (mental and physical) for the full four years I have been booked in by the Director.As for Ken Bone\u2019s prognosis, I think a glance at Hans Castorp\u2019s case history will tell us all we need to know:\n\u201c\u2026Farewell, [Ken Bone] \u2014 whether you live or stay where you are! Your chances are not good. The wicked dance in which you are caught up will last many a little sinful year yet, and we would not wager much that you will come out whole\u2026.\u201d."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4542979-kim", "userReview": "There were times when I wondered if I\u2019d ever finish this book. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to, but reading a novel driven by ideas rather by plot or character has its challenges. Particularly if, like me, you do most of your reading at night, in between getting into bed and switching off the light. This is not the kind of novel which can be read, digested and disposed of quickly. It demands concentration, patience and perseverance \u2013 qualities in which I am frequently lacking at the end of a day at work. But persevere I did, alongside the novel\u2019s central protagonist Hans Castorp, as he lived seven long years in a tuberculosis sanatorium in the Alps, exploring love, history, philosophy, music, religion and the meaning of life and death in an environment symbolic of pre-World War I Europe. I say seven long years because that\u2019s usually how they appeared to me as I worked my way through a chapter every few nights for more than two months, but to Hans Castorp those years appeared much shorter: the passage of time and how it varies according to circumstances is a central theme of the work. This is a novel in which little happens in terms of conventional (or even unconventional) plot and character development. What in most other novels would be digressions are its point. Whether that appeals will depend in large part on what you want to get from reading fiction. If it\u2019s relaxation and entertainment, then chances are this is not the novel for you, even though it contains plenty of irony and some sly humour. If you want an intellectual challenge and don\u2019t mind feeling some level of frustration (in my case the frustration was at least in part knowing that I\u2019d be getting more out of the work if I knew more to start with), then it may well be worthwhile. I feel like I\u2019ve climbed a mountain and then descended into the valleys. It wasn\u2019t always magic, but it has given me a sense of achievement. And as I read the last few pages, in awe of Mann\u2019s brilliance, I offered up a prayer of thanks to the literary gods that I hadn\u2019t abandoned the journey. The view from the end made the difficult bits worthwhile. I read this novel with the Thomas Mann Group, lurking rather than actively discussing, but ever grateful for the insight of group members."}, {"userName": "Lawyer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3025547-lawyer", "userReview": "The Magic Mountain: Thomas Mann's Ambiguous BildungsromanAh, Thomas Mann, you have held me captive from a hot summer's day in August until I have begun to see the first hints of color tinging the leaves with a hue that will lead to their fall and ultimate decay. You have occupied my thoughts during long days and nights. I do not know whether to bless you or curse you, for I recognize how precious time is. At times the tick of the clock sounds ominous.At its most basic level Mann tells us of the cultural and social development of one human being, Hans Castorp. Hans is not unique. For each of us is born a blank slate. Those that surround us shape us with their values and beliefs. We accept them at times. At others we reject them. Each of us is a walking, waking, living Bildungrsoman, the great majority of us never being the subject between the covers of any book.Through various times in my life I have experienced illness. In a relatively short period of time, I recognized that I lived in a brief period of respite from life in a relentlessly care worn world. Indeed, in my youth, chicken pox, measles, infected tonsils, and suffocating asthma attacks, provided me with a short vacation in which I whiled away the hours reading my beloved books.I have encountered my Circes, my Madame Couchats. I have reveled in the power of Dionysus, my Herr Peeperkorns. During my odyssey I have felt the lure of the lotus eaters. But more than anything else, if I accept Mann's character of Hans Castorp to be some wandering Odysseus, I also recognize that we are frequently caught between Syclla and Charybdis and must navigate between the two.It was not until I became an adult with a responsible job, the responsibility of parenthood, that I felt the possibility of mortality. It was the fall of 1982. Each day I would begin with my customary energy only to become wracked with a fever in the afternoon and left in a state of listlessness and fatigue.A visit to my physician was required. A battery of blood tests followed. I was to meet with my doctor to discuss the results of the tests the afternoon of the same day. He was somewhat irritable that my lab work had not yielded a diagnosis. He stared across his desk at me, tapping his temple with a forefinger. I caught the beginning of a wry grin. Ah, Hofrat Behrens, you would have recognized the look of incipient triumph. Another vial of blood was drawn from me by his nurse. We both waited for the analysis in his office.Although we were separated in age by considerable years, we both shared a love of music. Both of us had been concert clarinetists in younger times. We discussed our favorite pieces of music.The nurse entered after knocking, handing over the analysis. \"By God, I love diagnostic medicine,\" my physician proclaimed with a great degree of professional satisfaction. \"You have hepatitis!\"\"How serious is that?\"\"Oh, could be nothing. Could be sky's the limit!\" He chuckled. I did not.Of course, I was quarantined in an isolated room at the hospital until the type of hepatitis could be determined. It was \"Non A, Non B\" hepatitis. Type C had not even entered the medical vocabulary at that point. The source of my illness was and has remained a mystery. Nor have any symptoms ever returned, though I am screened annually.However, that event over thirty years ago, was an important factor in the formation of my personal Gestalt of what it means to be a whole human being. While \"Hans in Luck\" enjoyed a seven year respite from responsibility, the pawn of Herr Sembretti and the absolutist Naphta, each of whom struggled over the young man's soul in a pedagogical exercise, I consider his story to be an ironic and imperfect Bildungsroman. I do not consider Castorp to have ever fully come to occupy his place in society as a fully developed human being.To be sure, Mann's writing is breathtakingly beautiful innumerable times. But in Mann's afterward to his monumental work, he urges the reader to undertake a second reading to fully understand it. This, I cannot do. Time is precious. Mann's dark humor causes me to reject such an effort for I cannot endure the lingering naivete of his protagonist. Perhaps, there is too much of Joachim Zeimssen in my view of life. Perhaps I was born to be a flatlander. I am content with that.Hans, requiescat in pace. May you have found purpose in your life."}], "description": "D\u00fcnya edebiyat\u0131n\u0131n \u00e7a\u011fda\u015f klasikleri aras\u0131nda an\u0131lan B\u00fcy\u00fcl\u00fc Da\u011f, tam bir \u00e7a\u011f roman\u0131d\u0131r.
