It was purchased along with other books for my classroom library. It has been picked up time and time again by my students, but they have shared that they just haven't been able to get through it. So, I decided I needed to find out for myself. I suspect that part of what might be uncomfortable for them is that the story for some may hit too close to home. Jared, our teenage protagonist is more responsible for his parents than they are of him. Drug abuse and alcoholism are big factors to the break up of his family. Mix that in with teenage pregnancy, suicide, Idle no More, and residential schools and is a heavy text. There is humor but it is also pretty dark.But for all its topics, I didn't like the book. I am in the minority because this book has plenty of glowing reviews. The fact that it is a trilogy doesn't interest me either."}, {"userName": "Krista", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista", "userReview": "The world is hard. You have to be harder.\nAuthor Eden Robinson calls Son of a Trickster \u201ca cognitive screwball gothic with working class people\u201d, and that's too precisely perfect a description for me not to just quote her. As the coming-of-age story of a sixteen-year-old Native kid, Jared Martin, this book explores all the familiar anxieties faced by high school kids everywhere (social acceptance, family expectations, drug and sexual experimentation), layers on the less familiar anxieties particular to his situation (his mom's a violent hothead who exposes her son to a series of psycho boyfriends while denying Jared access to the substance-abusing father who desperately needs his son to help pay rent for him and his new family), and then further layers on the totally unfamiliar anxieties of a kid who is experiencing the thinning of the barriers between this world and that inhabited by his people's traditional bogeymen. I don't always have a lot of patience for magical realism, but this read like classic Stephen King and was absolutely terrifying. I was enchanted by the whole thing.What works the best throughout this whole book is the believable decency of the main character, Jared \u2013 he is generous and empathetic and morally uncorrupted by the chaos around him \u2013 and his relationship with his mother: I laughed frequently at the verbal sparring between these two and their closeness radiated from the page. And not incidentally: the texting conversations between Jared and his mom (and a host of other characters) was probably the most believable use of this device I've ever read: why can't authors seem to get this right? Kudos to Robinson for knowing how and when to use texting.\nWith all the power of technology and science in the world, I would bet you dollars to doughnuts that you still trust a human face to be a human. But come closer and let me speak to the creatures that swim in your ancient oceans, the old ones that sing to you in your dreams. Encoded memories so frayed you think they're extinct, but they wait, coiled and unblinking, in your blood and in your bones.\nAs the membrane between our earthbound reality and that of Wee\u2019git the Trickster begins to thin for Jared, there are brief interludes in the narrative in which some entity (later become manifest as a swarm of fireflies) attempts to explain magic and altered consciousness through quantum physics; first to us the reader, and then to Jared himself. This sheen of science is useful, I guess, for those who might need convincing that ultradimensional beings are a natural feature of the universe (and not the easy-to-dismiss animism of so-called primitive religions), and I ate it up as simply interesting writing.Set in Kitimat, B.C. (Robinson's hometown), Jared and his mother live off the Rez, but through school, Jared has contact with many Natives and non-Natives. Living in a party-house (his Mom and her boyfriend are drug-dealers), Jared is frequently given beer and shots, and most of the book sees him getting blackout drunk and showing up on YouTube with smart-mouthed rants and stumbling pratfall compilations. He's the Cookie Dude with the secret touch for baking pot cookies, but he also has a huge heart; helping the needy and taking the weight of the world on his thin shoulders. This book is filled with violence (of the human and supernatural varieties), people throwing their lives away on drugs and alcohol, and nonstop foul language; this view of Native life is totally unflattering. (There is one on-Rez kid, George \u201ccall me Crashpad\u201d, who is a sober sci-fi geek, and the mostly white granddaughter of Jared's neighbour engages in activism with Idle No More and anti-pipeline protests; but they're definitely the exceptions.) On the other hand, this could be the story of working-class people anywhere, and until the Trickster shows up, nothing much identifies this as a Native story.So, here's my criticism: I wanted more. The first chapter has Jared's paternal grandmother telling him, \u201cThat Trickster's been a huge dink to your mom's family for generations.\u201d Yet, we never learn any of the details of what has gone on through the generations. Late in the book, Jared's Mom makes brief reference to events from her youth (and from her own mother's experiences at a Residential School), but no details are provided. Even the ending didn't really tie things up for me. And yet...I was happy to read in an interview with Eden Robinson that she is already at work on a sequel, Trickster Drift, and I can only hope that the blanks will all be filled in eventually. Because I will be picking it up; Robinson is too skilled at world-building for me not to join her there."}, {"userName": "CaseyTheCanadianLesbrarian", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10463035-caseythecanadianlesbrarian", "userReview": "Son of a Trickster just came out after too many years without any new fiction from Eden Robinson. This novel is SO worth the wait. It\u2019s about Jared, a sixteen-year-old burnout who drinks too much and smokes too much pot and lives on the rez with his mom, who he can\u2019t trust to not bail on him and the bills or to not beat up guys who admittedly deserve it. But Jared is not a stereotype and not what an outsider would think: he\u2019s also an incredibly compassionate person, to the point that others take advantage of him, and a person simply in search of not wanting to hurt or be hurt. All this coming-of-age story is incredible in and of itself, but the small magical touches that Robinson has sprinkled throughout the story suddenly burst to the forefront of the narrative in a totally unexpected way at the end, making you glad this book is the first in a new trickster trilogy. It's also, like all her other books, hilarious. Take this excerpt that takes place when the main character Jared is a little kid getting dropped off at his Grandma\u2019s house:\u201cWhere\u2019s Jim-Bob?\u201d his mom said.\u201cWhoring,\u201d Nana Sophia said.\u201cJesus, Mother.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a walking dick these days,\u201d Nana Sophia said. \u201cThank you, Viagra. I hope his heart pops like the cancerous zit it is.\u201d \u201cJared\u2019s right here,\u201d his dad said.\u201cFine. No cookies and no unpleasant truths. Dry toast and stern lectures for everyone.\u201dProbably surprisingly for readers new to Robinson but not for me, Son of a Trickster also contains passages like this:Close your eyes. Concentrate on your breath. Remember that you were not always earthbound. Every living creature, every drop of water and every sombre mountain is the by-blow of some bloated, dying star. Deep down, we remember wriggling through the universe as beams of light.Read it now!

Jared, the main character, lives with his mother. His parents have split up, and his father, a recovering drug addict, has a new family. Jared's mother is scary, and has hurt various boyfriends for threatening or hurting Jared. Jared's mother also has anger issues.Jared is sixteen years old and a good guy. Jared is struggling in school, and spends much of his time drinking or doing drugs, making marijuana-laced cookies, or helping others. Jared has been giving his father money while not telling his mother, who tends to rage about her former husband and his new family. Jared also helps his elderly neighbours, clearing snow and other tasks.Jared's life is fraught with anger, with lonliness, and recently, weirdness. His maternal grandmother has long called him the son of Trickster, and doesn't appear to trust him.Eden Robinson has crafted a story I could not put down. Jared drifts through his life, avoiding confrontations with his mother, but seemingly unable to avoid them with his peers, thanks to his sarcastic mouth.At times, thanks to Jared's intoxication or drug use, he wasn't sure if the weird things were real or hallucinations; I like how Eden Robinson walks over that line separating drug-induced and fantastic/mythical. The characters are fantastic. Even if I found some scary, some dangerous, or some annoying, I felt like I was reading about real people. The conversations between Jared and Nana Sophia were my favourites.As this is the first of more books about Jared, you're left wondering what else does it mean for Jared being the son of Trickster."}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "To call this novel a coming of age story is a bit of a misdirection. It has elements of that but there is a lot more going on. I'm still a bit confused by this novel, honestly. Jared is a first nations kid in Canada who sometimes lives on the reservation. He has very little parenting, his grandmother claims he is not completely human and has some trickster in him, and he starts experiencing a realm of the supernatural. But then again, he's also someone who sells pot cookies and drinks more than he should, so part of my skeptical brain wondered if these experiences weren't just the fallout of chemicals in the brain of a not fully formed teenager. The people in his life who are most connected to this supernatural world, of witches and spells and general animism, seem to also be the most unreliable, so that begs another question.At the same time Jared has to bear more responsibility than he should have to. He has to figure out how to keep the power on when his Mom takes off, he ends up caring for an infant when his stepsister takes off, he is rejected by part of his family. So I found myself feeling very empathetic towards him. Near the end he attends a meeting to attempt a journey toward sobriety and it is so ill-received by his friends and family that it is obvious this is going to be a repeated struggle.The end of the book reveals where (the alleged) book 2 will go, but I'm not sure this book needs a sequel. I read this when it was longlisted for the Tournament of Books and came up as probably a dark horse.

All the characters speak in a witty-gritty way that I admire, but it almost felt as if Robinson is so good at all of the above--especially good at drunken dialog, for instance, or of writing characters who make stupid choices, or writing scenes that ignite with a sudden flash of violence--that it got to be too much for me, where it was a story that moved in circles rather than forward. I'm still a big fan but I felt Robinson's writing strengths eventually overwhelmed the actual story."}, {"userName": "jo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/210397-jo", "userReview": "[useless noodling; skip this paragraph if you want to get to the review!] there is a chinese wall between american readers and canadian literature. the only titan strong enough to have made a breach (but, see, it's her breach, no one but she can cross over, just like in kafka\u2019s parable!) is Margaret Atwood. even nobel prize winner Alice Munro is not a household name among american readers. Miriam Toews -- i haven't dug into numbers, but this is what it seems to me -- is more popular in italy than she is south of the border. and sure, there are Carol Shields and Michael Ondaatje, but here is the catch: i bet that a good number of those who have heard of them do not know that they are canadian. even atwood. please prove me wrong. \nthis books is amazing.\n it took Eden Robinson eight years to write Son of a Trickster and it shows. from the first page what struck me about it is how perfect it is, how precise, how carefully built, sentence by little sentence, with that effortlessness that is always the product of painstaking labor. this precision in the language is juxtaposed to a whole lot of mess -- messy lives, messy hygiene, messy love, messy gastroenterology (lots of bad eating, not eating, and bad drinking, and TONS of throwing up). and, on a more technical level, seemingly (but in fact not) messy timelines and storylines. the language, it seems to me, is the one rigorous thing that holds everything together supple tendons superglue. it even keeps together jared, the adorable teenage protagonist, who speaks carefully, corrects those who speak imprecisely, and uses language in that fast, \u00fcber-clever teen snark you wish you had had when you were a teen. needless to say, none of this makes him the most popular boy in town, but, miraculously, jared possesses that old-soul self-containedness some kids have (that, too, is something you wish you had had when you were a teen!) that allows them genuinely not to care. a lot of the language is (teen?) jargon and shorthand and this, more than other things (this book is not big on descriptions and explanations) do the work of giving the reader a sense of the place, the time and the human climate. not all of it is immediately understandable to the non-local, non-teenage reader, but, like all good writers, robinson lets you figure it out on your own. jared, the son of a trickster (the formulation is meant to sounds a bit like son of a bitch, i.e. like a curse or insult, both of which it is, in a way), is the kind of kid who takes upon himself the job of keeping the adults of his family in house and home. he is no saint, but he\u2019s got a clear set of morals, and he won\u2019t be budged. jared does what needs to be done, damned the consequences. \nthis is not marketed as a YA book, but if you know a teen who is having a shitty time and who won't get traumatized by talk of sex and drugs, jared\u2019s solid decency in the face of a decidedly shitty life may be something they might find solace in.\nthe key features of jared's surroundings are poverty and lack of resources of all kinds. the entire community seems to consist of: more or less put-together habitations, some kind of all-purpose store, a liquor store, a church, a school. also, the beach, which is used mostly to party (but we do see this from a teen\u2019s point of view, so maybe there is a whole other lot going on there too, though one is hard pressed to imagine what). partying at the beach equals getting high on booze and substances of all kinds. the kids and the adults in jared\u2019s world all seem to find entertainment only in getting high, watching tv, gaming, and boning each other. we know that some characters are natives and some are not, but robinson doesn't seem that interested in demarcating exactly who is what. likewise, even though the town straddles the reservation, she is not interested in telling us what lies on which side.the brutality of jared\u2019s life is highlighted by the way the novel starts, which is idyllically, with loving mom, dad and child jared setting out to move because of dad's new job. robinson doesn\u2019t tell us why things go so dramatically sideways in the next chapter, which takes place some ten years later, but after a bit you get a sense. i am as far from a working class native american as i can possibly be (being, as i am, a white italian immigrant, educated and middle class, born, raised and educated in italy, barely assimilated yet somehow no longer properly italian either), but when the magic stuff, which is just as magic as it is theological, starts playing a stronger role in the novel, i sort of get something, and this something may be entirely wrong, but i feel i owe it robinson and the jareds of the world to try to say it what it is. what i get is that cultures live in an always precarious equilibrium, and this equilibrium is, among other things, predicated on how they make sense of, partition if you will, good and evil. in other words, a culture is solid when people tend to agree on what is good and what is bad (in this particular time in the united states this agreement is getting more and more undermined and this is causing a tremendous cultural crisis). jared\u2019s community, like, arguably, most communities, relies for its understanding of good and evil on a solid relationship with the divine. this is a theme that recurs in native literature so i don\u2019t think i\u2019m too far off. if this connection with the divine gets wobbly enough evil (a supernatural force according to pretty much all religions) has no balancing (good) force with which to be held at bay (in Son of a Trickster is certainly evil and damaging and corrosive, but also, via the figure of the trickster, it is mischievous and able to be bent to do the right thing).\nthis is why the religious aspect is so brilliantly essential to the book, and i must say that robinson does it so darn well, with humor and that playful irreverence we often encounter in literature by people of color (cuz you\u2019ve gotta laugh, dontcha? i mean, you can and will cry, but humor is what, at the end of the day, will keep you alive). \nyou cannot starve a people, rob it of their jobs, rob it of land and prospects, rob of it the material makings of dignity and autonomy, and expect them to keep their culture alive. cultures need to be fed. they need food in the belly -- not any old crap food, but decent food, cuz the shitty food that doesn\u2019t give real nourishment will make one puke, and puke, and puke, all book long."}, {"userName": "Jan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8550623-jan", "userReview": "Reminds me of  The Animators in the way it starts out as

I\u2019m trying to read more books by Indigenous authors, and this one looked really good. Sure enough, it\u2019s a smart and savvy novel that delivers great characters and dialogue, never compromising on its message while still remaining entertaining. Thanks to NetGalley and Knopf for providing me with an ARC.Jared, like Eden Robinson herself, is Haisla and Heiltsuk and lives in Kitimat, British Columbia. When we first meet him, as a young boy, his parents are moving west\u2014following work\u2014and his maternal grandmother is being mean to him, claiming his father isn\u2019t really his father but that he is instead Wee\u2019git\u2019s son, a trickster\u2019s son. In contrast, Jared\u2019s paternal grandmother showers him with affection and remains a source of support throughout much of the intervening years. Jumping ahead to when Jared is 16, the novel shows us a very different world: Jared lives with his mom, who wants him to have nothing to do with his father, though he is secretly giving money to his father and stepsister. He\u2019s basically just trying to keep his head down, get through school, make enough money to help out his family, etc. But people, and other beings, keep getting in the way.Son of a Trickster does not pull its punches when it comes to the bleakness of its situation. In many ways it reminds me of \nLullabies for Little Criminals\n. In both cases, the protagonist lives in poverty with negligent parents. Jared has somewhat more agency than Baby did, a function of his age, gender, and particular circumstances: he is still in school, and at 16 he has started figuring out how to earn his own cash. But make no mistake: this is not a \u201cfeel good\u201d novel of \u201credemption.\u201d There is a lot of swearing and a lot of darkness. Jared seems inexorably to jump from frying pan to fire, and the cloying sheen of the \u201cit gets better\u201d after-school special is nowhere to be seen.I love Jared as a character. He\u2019s just so \u2026 16, but that mature kind of 16 that crops up when you can\u2019t rely on your parents. And he is just so good. He could easily embrace crime, start dealing drugs like Richie and his mom want him to, start carrying a gun and becoming a heavy \u2026 but he deliberately pushes that out of his life. He goes over to his next-door neighbour to shovel her drive and help her with chores. He works assiduously to earn enough money to help out his dad. Yes, he smokes pot and makes pot cookies for his largest source of income (he also has a paper route). But Robinson captures that paradox of being 16: you\u2019re too old to be called a child but too young to be treated fully like an adult.Jared is still in school, trying to survive Grade 10 in this book, and that\u2019s kind of amazing given all the shit he has to deal with. Sometimes he has to take buses across town to give money to his stepsister to pay off his dad\u2019s back rent \u2026 and still he tries to study and do his homework. Sure, he isn\u2019t always successful\u2014but when some kids would drop out, Jared perseveres. And note that I\u2019m not trying to hold up Jared as some kind of anomaly among 16-year-olds\u2014quite the opposite, in fact. I think many authors underestimate adolescents, but that isn\u2019t the case here.Nor is Jared pure. He has his share of flaws, makes his share of mistakes. He drinks, even blacks out, and then others have to fill him in on the poor choices he made (hello, viral videos). But there are also times he doesn\u2019t black out, or times he doesn\u2019t make the poorer choice, and Robinson shows us those too. The former are just as important as the latter, because it\u2019s their contrast that makes him a worthwhile protagonist\u2014and, in the end, it\u2019s the choices that Jared makes to confront those past choices that makes him change and grow.The setting helps to amplify Jared\u2019s struggle for the reader. I\u2019m quite harsh on Jared\u2019s mom here, because I think she\u2019s irresponsible in her parenting, but I am sympathetic to the challenges she faces as a single parent with no stable income. I\u2019ve seen the effects of poverty on families, especially among First Nations youth in an urban environment. The conditions that Robinson depicts in Son of a Trickster are real. Nevertheless, I\u2019ve been fortunate enough in my life never to experience poverty myself. I\u2019ve never known the sensation of not knowing what I\u2019m eating that same day, or lived under the sword of the utility company cutting my power. Jared\u2019s precariousness is a constant presence in this novel, and Robinson represents it in a way that underscores its significance for readers who might otherwise be ignorant of its effects.This is also an extremely tech and culturally savvy novel. It\u2019s subtle, but by the end of the book I had really come to appreciate how Robinson weaves these elements throughout the book. Jared corresponds with several people via text or Facebook message; the later is his principal mode of communication with Nana Sophia. Robinson\u2019s voice in these moments is very accurate; she captures the atmosphere created by these media. Also, I just love the nerdy references to shows like Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica, most of which originate from a rez kid, George, who insists Jared start calling him by the \u201ccallsign\u201d of Crashpad. Indigenous people, particularly Indigenous youth, are underrepresented as it is in literature\u2014but when they do put in an appearance, there is a tendency to ground them almost exclusively in Indigenous iconography (and often generic or mistaken iconography at that). These stereotypes are so pervasive that our Prime Minister recently commented at a town hall that the youth he spoke with want \u201ccanoe storage\u201d over rec centres with WiFi. (Insert audible eyerolling here.) Robinson combats this stereotype quite neatly here, for Crashpad might live on the reserve, but he and his friends are just as phone-obsessed, Internet binging, sci-fi watching as teenagers of any stripe.When Haisla/Heiltsuk traditions and history are referenced, it\u2019s because it relates to the plot or characters in some way. Jared learns a little bit about how his maternal grandmother\u2019s experiences at residential school affected her. Several of the women in his life, from his mother to Nana Sophia to some others I won\u2019t spoil, are \u201cwitches\u201d with access to powers and spells; other characters share with Jared a heritage that is more-than-human. There\u2019s a bit of an American Gods vibe happening here, although I recognize the latter is a pastiche of various religions and mythologies whereas this one is much more about Jared\u2019s personal journey through the cultures that lay claim to him.As I don\u2019t have the cultural background necessary to critique how Robinson portrays these elements, I\u2019m not going to go into much detail there. However, I wasn\u2019t sold on the way she uses the firefly beings that Jared sees to try to syncretize the magic with quantum mechanics. Any time someone tries to use quantum mechanics as an excuse for magic, a little alarm bell labelled \u201cwhat the bleep to we know\u201d goes off in my brain. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m against attempts to explain magic in pseudoscientific ways\u2014that can be fun, because this is, after all, fiction. Nevertheless, these kinds of attempts at equivalency tend to muddle what is already a muddy subject, because quantum mechanics is counter-intuitive and poorly explained, let alone understood. I think I get why Robinson did this, but I could have done without that entire element. Thankfully, it isn\u2019t a huge part of the plot and is easy enough to ignore.In addition to the tech/culture savviness, I love the subversive moments, like this one where Robinson has characters confront the gender binary. For all that I loved most of the dialogue, I actually only highlighted one passage in this book:\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m not regretting it. I\u2019m saying I don\u2019t believe in monogamy, but I don\u2019t fall in the sack with just anyone. And I certainly don\u2019t believe in gender the way you do, and you\u2019ve made it clear that you find my ways \u2018pervy.\u2019\u201d\u201cWhat\u201d?\u201cI\u2019m normally attracted to people willing to push heteronormative boundaries.\u201dJacob felt his eye twitching. \u201cSo you\u2019re gay?\u201d\u201cThere you go,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cThinking in Western binaries again.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re not gay.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like talking to a wall,\u201d Sarah said through gritted teeth. \u201cDo you even listen to anything I say?\u201d\u201cBut what does that mean? For us?\u201d\u201cIt means you confuse the hell out of me. I\u2019m frustrated.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s a big ditto.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so retro. How can I be with someone who still defines himself as strictly male?\u201d\u201cSo you like chicks? Or guys \u2026 or both? Is that, like, the trans one or the bi?\u201dSarah stopped swinging her legs and coolly considered him. She hopped down. \u201cYou\u2019re so not getting laid tonight.\u201dI\u2019m so-so on Sarah as a character, but I like the romance/not-a-romance between her and Jared. Again, it feels a lot less contrived or stereotypical than how these kinds of relationships are so often portrayed in books featuring young adults.As far as classifying this book, I suppose it might be called a \u201cyoung adult novel\u201d, though this is an example of how that label never really feels appropriate. This is a book adults should be reading, and a book that adolescents could read and enjoy too. Yes, there is sex and swearing and drugs and drinking in it. If you think your adolescent isn\u2019t aware of these things among their peers and even participating in such things themselves, I have a pipeline I can sell to you.I like the ending. I said before that this is not a novel of redemption, and I stand by that. This is a bleak book\u2014but it\u2019s bleakness with a hopeful ending. Like many such novels, it hits us hard and fast with so much that can go wrong in an adolescent\u2019s life\u2014and then it reminds us that there is always still hope. And I like that, for all that this book is about Jared\u2019s potential link to a Trickster figure, the conclusion is ultimately about Jared becoming more of who he already is rather than trying to shape-shift his identity to match something he is not.Son of a Trickster, then, is fantastic.

This year, I\u2019m starting with one in the hopes that it will bring more my way! Wishful thinking, maybe, but it certainly can\u2019t hurt.First, much thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for giving me the chance to read this fantastic book pre-publication!Son of a Trickster will be published on February 7th, and it certainly fits the bleak tone of the month. Jared, the main character, is a teen with a damn hard life. With a grandmother who thinks he\u2019s a trickster in disguise and a mom bouncing around with a drug-dealing boyfriend, things are certainly not rainbows and roses.Here\u2019s the thing though: it works. It works so incredibly well. This is the most realistic magical realism novel I\u2019ve ever read. The characters seem like they could have walked out of any small town, and the stoner community and mindset were super accurate. People sometimes have hard lives. That\u2019s just the way it is. It was a great change to read about such a realistic teen who is also such a good person.I think it\u2019s also worth noting that Jared is Native American, as are most of the characters in the book. So is the author herself \u2013 which makes this an #ownvoices read that I was happy to pick up. I rarely get to read YA with Native protagonists, which is really a shame.Characters were complex and believable. Everyone is dealing with their own issues and they often complicate each other\u2019s lives without even trying. Jared\u2019s mom has a mantra that is often repeated throughout \u2013 and rings both true and false.\u201cThe world is hard. You have to be harder.\u201dI\u2019ll say right out that this isn\u2019t the book for you if you take a critical view of underage swearing, drinking, drug use or sex. Maybe you should reconsider what you know of teenagers if you think their lives don\u2019t include those things though.I was interested to see how the magic would function as I expected it to stem from Indigenous beliefs, and I was pretty mesmerised by what was included. (Those otters, though. For real.) I\u2019m really eager for more! The small hints of the fantastic are included from the very start, but they never overwhelm the narrative. The clear existence of a mystical world just sitting alongside our own was pretty shocking, but in the best possible way.(Also \u2013 Jared\u2019s reaction to weird shit (read: magic) was always spot on. A+ to that.)Though there was a focus on the \u2018realism\u2019 aspect of this book, it was still steeped in magic, even when the characters were blitzed out of their minds. Despite their utter strangeness, the magical aspects of the book were totally believable. They were perhaps more believable because the reader is left to focus on the aspects themselves rather than the \u2018why\u2019 behind them.The strange short interludes in italics were an interesting addition to the book, and a welcome one.I was ultimately satisfied with the ending of the book when I took some time to mull it over. I learned that this is the first in a series, which means that the elements of magic that were briefly touched on may get more screen time in the next book.I can\u2019t wait to read more from Eden Robinson, and considering this book, I know that she won\u2019t disappoint!"}, {"userName": "\u2740 Susan G", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7820199-susan-g", "userReview": "https://ayearofbooksblog.com/2017/04/...I have to admit that I almost did not buy a copy of Son of a Trickster! I am ok with swearing and graphic language but really struggle with that \u201cc\u201dword which is sprinkled throughout the first chapter. During the author event at Laurier University, I cringed hearing that word during the reading. The author shared that she herself does not swear much but her characters do! Lucky for me, I kept an open mind and got carried away with the infections laughter and engaging storytelling of Eden Robinson.Son of a Trickster is a coming of age story describing the challenging teenage years of Jared who lives in a home of drugs, alcohol, parties and poverty. His parents are separated, he has been physically abused, he lives in a basement, has few friends and his beloved dog just died. He kindly supports his elderly neighbour, Mrs. Jaks who has been diagnosed with cancer and is the caregiver of her spouse with dementia.School is a challenge and he to supported his family selling weed cookies which led to more problems. His life is a blur of alcohol and drama when he starts blacking out, then seeing images of a bear, fireflies and even dangerous otters. He bounces through relationships with other students, the neighbour\u2019s granddaughter and other family as he comes to terms with his own situation.As Jared reflects on his childhood and learns more about his family and his indigenous heritage he must make choices which will impact his future. This is a difficult story to read but sadly, there are likely many teens living in such situations. Eden Robinson has made the tale real and introduced indigenous heritage and mysticism into the story.

His friends at school offer some release, but really his peer group has similar problems. It is therefore a depressing read, reminds me of a YA book I read earlier this year, Bonnie-Sue Hitchcock\u2019s The Smell Of Other People\u2019s Houses. Hitchcock\u2019s book is marginally a more enjoyable read, and set in Alaska, similarly short hours of daylight and weather in the winter. The story in effect is just a window into Jared\u2019s life for a little more than a year, and therefore struggled to hold my interest. My biggest criticism though is that it fails to accurately portray adolescence. I realise this is a controversial criticism, adolescence is something we can all claim to know a lot about, having been there.

I received a copy from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for my honest opinion.My thoughts on Son of a Trickster mostly focus on the perils of basing expectations for one book on another book.Two things drew me to this book: Eden Robinson (Haisla First Nation author) + magical realism. I previously read and enjoyed Robinson\u2019s \n Monkey Beach\n. Son of a Trickster stars teenage boy Jared, who differs greatly from Monkey Beach\u2019s adult woman Lisa (what an astute observation, Jenna). I didn\u2019t realize how much my enjoyment of Monkey Beach depended on Lisa until I started Son of a Trickster. Jared is a great character but not one with which I personally connect.When I read Monkey Beach, I did not anticipate any magical realism. Only when I finished the book and participated in a group discussion did the term come up to describe the story. I personally wouldn\u2019t have described the book as magical realism, although technically that\u2019s what it was (to me it was a lot more real than magical). I only remembered all this when I looked back on my review a few minutes ago. :P In contrast, I had high expectations for the magical realism in Son of a Trickster. I lifted expectations for Son of a Trickster from Monkey Beach without considering the obvious differences between the books.The jacket description above describes spot-on the content of Son of a Trickster. It\u2019s my bad for expecting more magical realism in this tale. A virtual footnote in the summary translates to a relatively minor role in the story. Jared\u2019s \u2018magical\u2019 abilities start to have a serious impact on the story about two thirds of the way in. I liked exploring particular Indigenous beliefs and culture through Jared\u2019s eyes, as he learns bit by bit about what he can see and about his family\u2019s background (Jared is \u201cpart \u2018Namgis, part Heiltsuk\u201d). I would definitely describeSon of a Trickster as magical realism, in a way that I wouldn\u2019t describe Monkey Beach. But Jared\u2019s story is really about family relationships. The \u2018magic\u2019 is just a means to explore that topic. And I suppose that\u2019s generally how you might describe magical realism (you could argue Monkey Beach is the same way), but I\u2019m always hoping the magical elements will be more of a focus. Honestly, as I type this out, I can imagine someone who\u2019s read this book being aghast and saying the magic plays a lot more significant role, but that\u2019s how it felt to me. I have the impression that the next books in the trilogy will delve more into Jared\u2019s family background and abilities. Son of a Trickster does have something of an introductory story line vibe to it.To summarize, Son of a Trickster did not match my misguided expectations, but it is by no means a poor book. Here are some reasons you might enjoy it:Jared is an engaging main character. I kept reading because I wanted to know what he would do next. He really is just a kid trying to make do with an awful situation. Like the description says, he \u201chas an immense capacity for compassion\u201d. Most of the adults around him are disasters, often causing me to grit my teeth and roll my eyes (ugh, his Mom). He\u2019s not an angel, but despite his poor circumstances, Jared remains a good kid, guided by good intentions. There are some moving moments in the story where I found myself thinking, \u201cGeez, he really is just a 16 year old kid\u201d despite the partying, drinking, etc. he gets into. If you love reading about dysfunctional families \u2013 you will love this book.My favourite strength of Robinson\u2019s is her ability to created vivid and believable settings. She does an excellent job of translating her personal experience and knowledge of real world places onto the page. (Son of a Trickster is set in her hometown of Kitimaat, in northern British Columbia, with many scenes also taking place on the nearby reserve).The book contains many specific cultural references, so much so that you can easily pin down the time period of the story. Examples include Idle No More protests, songs such as Red Skin Girl and Like A G6, and debates over the best Doctor in Doctor Who. The text message exchanges between Jared and various characters felt real, not constructed. Sometimes specific references irk me. In this case, I found they added realism to the story.The Bottom Line: Overall, this book is a solid addition to the field of Indigenous literature. The representation of Indigenous youth like Jared and his friends is something the field could always use more of. The magical realism aspect of the story adds another layer of culture and intrigue to something that might read too bleak. Recommended for fans of Indigenous literature, dysfunctional families, or kids trying to do their best they know how. I\u2019d also recommend this for teens -there\u2019s a lot for them to enjoy here."}, {"userName": "Specialk", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5631790-specialk", "userReview": "You're going to get a quarter of the way through this book and be like \"Soooo....\" And halfway through you'll be like \"Stilllllll waiting....\".But it's worth it.

The exciting first novel in her trickster trilogy.Everyone knows a guy like Jared: the burnout kid in high school who sells weed cookies and has a scary mom who's often wasted and wielding some kind of weapon. Jared does smoke and drink too much, and he does make the best cookies in town, and his mom is a mess, but he's also a kid who has an immense capacity for compassion and an impulse to watch over people more than twice his age, and he can't rely on anyone for consistent love and support, except for his flatulent pit bull, Baby Killer (he calls her Baby)--and now she's dead. Jared can't count on his mom to stay sober and stick around to take care of him. He can't rely on his dad to pay the bills and support his new wife and step-daughter. Jared is only sixteen but feels like he is the one who must stabilize his family's life, even look out for his elderly neighbours. But he struggles to keep everything afloat...and sometimes he blacks out. And he puzzles over why his maternal grandmother has never liked him, why she says he's the son of a trickster, that he isn't human. Mind you, ravens speak to him--even when he's not stoned.
