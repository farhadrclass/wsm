I really want to shake someone - hard! Despite the fact that the author is obviously talented and her research of the era was seamlessly incorporated into an interesting story, I am left unsatisfied by this book on a number of levels. The first half was a beautifully written character study of a strong minded young white girl who wanted to take control of her life, and the young black man who helped her to achieve her goals. I thought both themes of gender and racial equality in that period of history were handed very well. I smiled and laughed out loud many times at the lovely relationship that developed between the two of them, and how their differences brought them together in so many ways. I was enchanted, and drove my husband nuts reading little snippets aloud that particularly delighted me. Then - bam! - with one fell swoop the story changed direction completely and utterly. Despite not wanting to read the violent, debasing events that throw Olivia's life into turmoil, I appreciated that as a dramatic tool those events were effective in bringing change to her story. It went from hope to despair over a handful of paragraphs, and the transition felt abrupt, total and shocking. Olivia's struggle in the second half of the book is almost epic - she's really getting paid back by karma for the relative smoothness and harmony in the first. Sadly when Olivia lost hope, so did I. I am not criticising the author for using these events to develop her story. I am however criticising her for leaving the reader with so many unresolved issues surrounding the characters. But to ask us to invest emotionally in the characters and then leave most of the important issues unresolved is cruel and I can only assume a ham-fisted ploy to force the reader's hand to purchase the next book in the series. No thanks. Two stars for the parts I thoroughly enjoyed. Minus three stars for reader manipulation."}, {"userName": "Ora", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6291625-ora", "userReview": "It really makes me MAD that I have to buy book two to find out how book one SHOULD have ended.

The story begins in Pennsylvania, in the January of 1841, with the death of the eponymous main character\u2019s father, making Olivia and her two brothers orphans. But don\u2019t be fooled by the story\u2019s title: this is not the tale of a mourning daughter. Mourning is the name of the second main character of the story: Mourning Free, the son of black slaves, a boy who has spent his life as the only \u2018coloured\u2019 person in town, working for all the town\u2019s residents in return for food and occasional shelter.The story of Olivia and Mourning highlights the issues of both gender and race at a time of major historical upheaval. The country was divided into slave and free states and although Pennsylvania was free, there remained the continual threat of bounty-hunters looking for former slaves to capture and return to the southern states. Being a woman in the America of 1841 meant a destiny of hiding demurely behind your poke bonnet and accepting a predetermined destiny of marriage (if you were \u2018lucky\u2019) and domestic drudgery. But even if she wanted to marry, who would there be in the one-horse town of Five Rocks for Olivia to spend her life with? Woman\u2019s lot is summed up by Olivia\u2019s father\u2019s former \"whore\", Jettie Place, when she says: \u201cPeople will forgive just about anything in a man, except being weak, and the one thing they absolutely cannot forgive a woman is being too strong\u201d. But 17-year-old Olivia\u2019s problem is that she is strong. When she claims a legacy to the \u201ceighty useless acres in the swamp known as Michigan\u201d left to the family by her Uncle Lorenzo Scruggs, it\u2019s her childhood friend, Mourning, she chooses to accompany her as her \u2018hired man\u2019 to help her transform the land into a working farm.When Olivia and Mourning settle on Uncle Scruggs\u2019 land, they are soon visited by local busy-bodies, the sinister Mr and Mrs Stubblefield. In spite of their ostensible friendliness, something bodes ill about Mrs Stubblefield\u2019s smothering and patronising attitude, and her disapproval of Olivia\u2019s companionship with her \u2018coloured\u2019 hired man. This is the point where the story takes a very dark turn indeed and her obsession with the dates of Olivia\u2019s \"monthly visitor\" soon sounds alarm bells clanging in the reader\u2019s mind.In the horrific climax of the story I found the narrative almost too graphic to bear, and yet the appalling ordeal Olivia is forced to undergo never veers beyond the bounds of suspension of disbelief. Her return to her home town of Five Rocks, alone, sees her face an impossible dilemma and she finds help from the one person in town shunned by all the other residents. By the end of the story, I was desperately seeking to make the same discovery that Olivia herself longs to know, but I found out that I\u2019m just going to have to read the next book. I can\u2019t wait."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11180490-michael", "userReview": "This is a richly imagined book. I loved it. It was a pleasure that never subsided. I always wanted to know, as E. M. Forster wrote, what would come next. The tension is established in the early pages of the book. In the early half of the nineteenth century, the young white woman Olivia decides to set out west with a black companion to settle land and thus claim it and have property of her own and not be dependent on others. She's terrifically drawn: an independent, and marvelously (and foolishly?) willful character. The book describes their adventures and realizations. What I especially loved is how historical details wereseamlessly interwoven in the tapestry of a novel that tells what, whether the protagonists succeed or not, is essentially an heroic tale.Warmly recommended."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/842569-angie", "userReview": "It has been a long time since I have added a book to my \" 5 star favorites \" shelf , but this one so deserves a spot there !

It suggests grief, but goes beyond that to offer an unusual pairing between two fascinating characters: Olivia Killion, a white teenage girl determined to run her father\u2019s farm but cannot make it a success on her own, and Mourning Free, a black orphan who knows how to fix a wagon wheel, raise a barn, put on a roof, clear a field, and shoe a horse. \u201cWon\u2019t expect to be paid as much as a white man either.\u201d The overlay of sadness and hope in the name Mourning Free is amazing to me. It enriches the text every time it appears. The writing is exquisitely crafted. \u201cThe first thing the Jacksons did was change their name to Free. The anti-slavery people tried to talk them into choosing something else, saying it was far too obvious, but Wilis and Rosie were set on being called Free. Sadly they enjoyed only a few months of liberty before Willis succumbed to influenza. Then a few weeks later Rosie died giving birth to Mourning.\u201dWhen Mourning was four he began working alongside his foster father. Olivia knew him all her life. She was the one who taught him to read and write. Because of the prevalent racism, Olivia must now disguise the connection between them, and pretend that their partnership is nothing more than a relationship between master and servant\u2014until, in the final twist of the story, she knows she can no longer hide it. The dialog imparts the natural rhythms of speech. It also reflects the historical period with great ease when describing clothing, laws, and attitudes. I love the little details: for example, when Olivia hands two five dollar coins to Mourning, she tells him, \u201cSafest thing would be to keep one in each boot. No matter what, you\u2019ve always got some money.\u201dThis is a story about survival against all odds. Out of suffering, comes the possibility of a new beginning, one without the need for pretense. Out of grief, hope.Five stars."}, {"userName": "Yael Politis", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2429087-yael-politis", "userReview": "I would like to share the wonderful review that Olivia, Mourning received in the January 2014 issue of Midwest Book Review:\"Olivia, Mourning, Book 1 of the 'Olivia' series, is historical fiction at its best ... Olivia, Mourning is about the changing complexities of human relationships and politics as much as it is about one determined young girl's desire to make her own place in the world, outside of boundaries and conventions. It's also a story of trauma and how even the closest-held relationships and secrets change.Expect no easy conclusions to Book 1: it's all about transition points and leaves the door open for further journeys with Olivia. Readers interested in historical fiction with a healthy dose of romance will find Olivia, Mourning a compelling, gripping saga that deliciously wraps what could be predictable elements in a cloak of many choices. It's all about options and consequences - and is a heartfelt story especially recommended for readers who enjoy headstrong protagonists tasked with making their own way in the world.\"-- D.

Olivia has lost her father and seeks to gain an inheritance of her so that she doesn't have to be dependent on her older brother or feel pressed to accede to others expectations that she must marry. She secretly decides to claim the farm in Michigan left by an uncle. She knows she will need help,to survive in this rural setting as she has never farmed at all and has led a very sheltered and privileged life. She persuades the young black orphan Mourning Free, whose life has had him helping with many handyman tasks to join her with a promise to get his own farm after she has established her claim. The story is fast paced and filled with scenarios of challenge taking many unexpected turns as these young partners travel from PA to Detroit to the farm and work to create a viable farm in the still sparsely settled backwoods of Michigan somewhere between Detroit and Ann Arbor. Hard to put this book down and once I finished I immediately got ahold of the second book in the Olivia series,.themes of slavery and race relations, family secrets, and religious fanaticism as well as development of the early historical era of settlement in Michigan."}, {"userName": "Wanda", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12836621-wanda", "userReview": "Olivia, Mourning is a phenomenal book - storytelling at its best! This historical fiction, with a wealth of information, is an emotional read with drama and overwhelming challenges throughout. The storyline never lost momentum and my interest never waned. The descriptive writing was beautiful with vivid details on the living conditions, but simple and flowing - easy to read. Olivia was determined to inherit the 80 acres in Michigan, left by her Uncle Scruggs - a place called Fae's Landing. She had no idea how to run a farm, but she had six hundred dollars to start the venture and all she had to do to claim the land was put in a crop. She hires Mourning Free - he would be perfect and would work for less than a white man. Mourning had a natural ability for fixing things and would do anything asked of him without complaint. And Mourning sure needed a new start. After a rather arduous trip, they arrive in Michigan to find horrible living conditions, but Mourning was optimistic, saying all beginnings are hard. It seemed all there was to life was doing chores and Olivia had no idea things would be this bad. And the story unfolds with startling revelations to come. I absolutely loved the characters - very well developed. Mourning, speaking in the vernacular, brought the dialogue to life. There were impossible situations that made for an unhappy ending which left you hanging with a lot of unresolved issues. But book 2 is already out there and I hope to read it in the near future. This is definitely a 5 star novel by a truly gifted writer.

She took care of her invalid father for two years. After his death, Olivia decides to fulfill her father's will, which states land may be claimed by his offspring, through working land in Michigan. Her friend Mourning Free goes with her to help her. The two young people face seemingly insurmountable challenges. It's 1841. Olivia is only 17 and female, in a harsh, male-dominated world. Mourning Free is the son of escaped slaves, subject to capture. His father died before he was born, and his mother died giving birth to him. The midwife crooned, \"Oh, this mourning child,\" as she held him. And that was the name written in the church registry. In trying to convince Mourning to accompany her, Olivia read from \"\u2026a copy of the Journal of the American West.
