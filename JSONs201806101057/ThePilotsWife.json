I read this book a long time ago, before I become a member of Goodreads and well before I started writing book reviews. But, when I heard of Anita Shreve\u2019s passing, this book came back to the forefront of my mind, as I recalled bits and pieces of it quite vividly. Although I have so many books to review, with deadlines, no less, I couldn\u2019t resist giving this book a second look. This novel, when it was first released, benefited greatly from the press that resulted from Oprah Winfrey\u2019s having selected it for her book club. However, initially, I wasn\u2019t sure if it was my kind of book and didn\u2019t immediately rush out and buy a copy at the peak of its popularity. But, eventually, my curiosity got the best of me. I never could have imagined the impact this book would have on me, or the way it would guide my reading habits from that time forward. Briefly, for those who may not have read the book or just a quick refresher for those who have- Kathryn\u2019s husband, Jack, is a pilot, and together they have a teenage daughter. Life is pretty good, and Kathryn has learned to accept the ebbs and flows within her marriage. But, when she gets the news a plane Jack was piloting exploded in midair, everything she thought she knew about her daughter, her husband and even herself is thrown into question. Was it a mechanical malfunction, or pilot error- or something far more sinister? Jack\u2019s occupation explains his absences from home, but it is an adjustment his family has had to learn to live with. His job also comes in handy when it comes to sustaining secrets and hiding things from his wife and daughter. Many may question how na\u00efve Kathryn was, but I didn\u2019t feel as though she buried her head in the sand. Of course, as the story unfolds, episodes from the past all click into place and Kathryn realizes she was na\u00efve, perhaps complacent, was too trusting, too confident in her life, but didn\u2019t she have the right to be? Or should she have remained in a state of hyper awareness at all times? Is is wrong to enjoy contentment? Even now, with the passage of time, the emotions the book stirred in me the first time around, resurfaced once again, as strong as before, maybe even more so, even knowing everything that was going to happen in advance. The story still held my rapt attention and sucked me into Kathryn\u2019s mind -numbing vortex as she stumbles across one shocking betrayal after another. The suspense is still nearly unbearable at times, the characterizations firm, if not always likeable, and the tantalizing and teasing pacing, is genius. The story does seem dated a little, at this point, and as a more jaded reader, I may have figured things out a lot quicker if I\u2019d been reading it for the first time, but it is still a powerful heart wrenching novel of suspense and riveting family drama. I have read several other books written by Shreve over the years, but so far, although very well written, they didn\u2019t quite manage to have the same effect on me as this one did.4.5 stars rounded up"}, {"userName": "Debbie Petersen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1079398-debbie-petersen", "userReview": "Another bomb from Shreve.

But when Kathryn Lyons receives word that a plane flown by her husband, Jack, has exploded near the coast of Ireland, she confronts the unfathomable-one startling revelation at a time. Soon drawn into a maelstrom of publicity fueled by rumors that Jack led a secret life, Kathryn sets out to learn who her husband really was, whatever that knowledge might cost. Her search propels this taut, impassioned novel as it movingly explores the question, How well can we ever really know another person?I watched the movie many years ago and still remember it. The movie was more action-driven in a way, and less emotionally orientated than the book, although the ambiance of the book was perfectly captured. Kathryn Lyons mourned the idyllic life she has lost after learning about her husband's deceit. In the end she did not mourn her husband Jack, but the good life he had cheated them out of. They had a daughter together, who had to learn the truth about her father in the end and make peace with his good memories, as well as the legacy he left behind. Being a teenager, Maddy had to navigate the start of an adult life with a mother gone to Ireland, searching for Jack's alleged connection to the IRA and the smuggling of explosives between Boston and Ireland. She discovered much more than that.I was in a mood for a placid, gentle read after a few high-voltage murder mysteries and literature. This was the perfect choice. Although the author's books lean heavily on the emotional turbulence it ignites in the reader, the stories are always a moral showground with many questions left for the readers to find answers to. The longer one lingers on the issues, the more intricate the answers become. Jack was a good man. Loving. Hardworking. He could have been anyone of us. But then he was not. Nothing in life is cut and paste or black or white. Between Kathryn's and Jack's version of the events, the facts had to be found, but it was not as easy as it sounded and Jack was dead ...The book is beautiful. It is enhanced by the movie.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLx1F...I've been wanting to read this book for so long. I'm so happy it finally happened.

The back cover described it as \u201coddly gripping\u201d, and the premise looked intriguing enough for me to actually buy the book on purpose: a wife delves into what really caused her husband\u2019s plane to crash, only to find out...he was leading a double life!! In England!!! How could a book about loss, betrayal, and really big secrets fail to entertain? Unfortunately, none of the characters was even marginally appealing, and overall the story was just bleak and boring. There was even a contrived \"love\" story that, weirdly, made the story even grimmer."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37796-janet", "userReview": "This could be a quick read but is sometimes painful & I would have to put it down until I could read and savor a passage or two at a better time. I often read during lunch break at work & some books simply aren't meant to be read in an office setting - this is one of them. Kathryn, the pilot's wife, is so well written - you not only feel what she feels, you eventually know what she will feel before it is written for you. No doubt this is because I could be the pilot's wife; I could live her life - I have lived her life; I have had her experiences and doubts; I have had her trust and faith that life is as it is - and then it isn't. I have not gone through the pain of death and then life collapses but I have had life collapse in on itself and this story rings true. Shreve writes \"Where was Kathryn to put these memories now? She was, she thought , like a woman after a divorce looking at a wedding dress. Could the dress no longer be cherished if the marriage itself had disintegrated?\" My dress is now 30 years old and the marriage has been over for 17 - the dress (and the memories) are carefully wrapped & sit in a closet - the dress never comes out but occasionally the memories do. So my only complaint is the ending of the story - it ends too quickly and too neatly - Kathryn & the reader deserve more."}, {"userName": "Gemma", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67746782-gemma", "userReview": "I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t feel any love for this. It dragged to begin with and virtually nothing happened for the first hundred pages. That wouldn\u2019t have bothered me had the writing been inspired or the characters compelling. Unfortunately, for me, neither was the case. Katheryn, the wife who\u2019s told her husband, the pilot, has died in an air crash, didn\u2019t provide any of those exciting identification moments when you see something of yourself or a good friend eloquently arrested and made lucid. The story does eventually become more engaging but it\u2019s always slow with lots of off-the-point dialogue and description, and I felt the author missed lots of opportunities to delve more deeply and more interestingly into the theme of how well do we know the person we are married to. Katheryn always seemed more of a device than a living character. I didn\u2019t get any exciting insights into married life or grief. For me it was neither literary nor commercial fiction but struggled half way between the two.

It was kind of boring in the first two thirds, and then when the main character travelled to England and discovered the \"twists,\" it just seemed kind of silly. I was also annoyed by the main character falling in love with the union rep. I get that people bond under intense circumstances, but I hate that falling in love seems to be the go to literary reaction. There are other ways for people to bond, and for people to respond to trying times. This wasn't quite as annoying as Bel Canto, because at least it was only one couple and not everyone falling in love, but I still find that convention irritating. I should have read this on my day off. I found myself kind of embarrassed to be reading a book about a pilot's wife at the airport. It felt too cliche, like I was fantasizing about being a pilot's wife or something. But it was kind of interesting to read something with characters dealing with the crazy aviation schedule. If only it hadn't been so damn melodramatic.I left the book in the United operations room in Richmond, so maybe someone else will find it who'll like it better."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "I had read so many great things about this book, and I saw it in a used book store, so I bought it.

For the most part I enjoy her writing and her stories, but the endings are sometimes unbearable. Anyway, this book was another Oprah book. It was pretty short and I got through it very quickly. Plot summary: The wife of a pilot learns that her husband's plane has gone down and that he is dead. While dealing with all the initial shock as well as dealing with the grief of their 15 year old daughter, she learns that the media and the investigators are saying that it was suicide. In an effort to prove to everyone that Jack would never commit suicide as well as murder all those passengers, she learns that her husband had many secrets from her and is not the man she thought he was for all those years together.This book made me feel sad. Is it so easy for people to live double lives? Wouldn't there be signs? Doubts? It definitely reinforced my beliefs that no matter how well you think you know someone or how long you are with them, you never know what they are thinking. You never know what someone is truly capable of. This book didn't do much to reinforce any sort of faith in humanity. Also, the book was too short. The plot developments were not fully developed and there are a lot of unanswered questions. Things happened too easily without enough conflict. I wanted more and was denied.

The Pilot's Wife by Anita Shreve.Shreve is a great writer... I love her language and use of words. I'm such a lover of language and the ways in which it can be swirled and whirled and encircle your mind making you want to read the same sentence over and over. Shreve is excellent at this task.She makes you think. And I like thinking.Right from the second page of the book she sets the essence of the whole book in motion...\"She took careful steps across the floor, as if moving too fast might set something in motion that hadn't yet begun.\"To think that both the author and the main character, Kathryn Lyons, (the pilot's \"wife,\") are already in tune with the fact that this could be true makes me think of the many times when I, if I had been more in tune with what surrounded me, would or could have had the same feeling.But, knowing does not change that. Knowing that getting a knock on the door in the middle of the night, meant almost certain dread to a pilot's wife, does not change that there is a knock at the door. Even not answering that door does not change what is on its other side.The stages that Kathryn moves though are as textbook as anyone going through a similar circumstance. And the ease with which this happens is as gripping as it has been for me when I have faced a loss...\"And then she moved from shock to grief the way she might enter another room.\"\"But it amazed her the way the body kept moving forward, past the shock and the grief, past the retching hollowness inside, and kept wanted sustenance, kept wanting to be fed. It seemed unsuitable, like wanting sex.\"\"'I can't explain it,' Kathryn said. 'I feel as though I've temporarily lost Jack and I need to find him.''You're not doing to find him,' Julia said. 'He's gone.'\"There is a sincere representation of marriage in this book that really depicts in my opinion how a marriage evolves. There were words that rang true and were well written about the marriage of Kathryn and Jack, or what I would consider a typical American marriage...\"But actually she thought that any marriage was like radio reception: It came and went.\"But, Kathryn's marriage does have its chinks. And they are legitimate. And Kathryn does begin to see the unseen.\"She doesn't know precisely what is wrong. She has only a vague feeling of vulnerability, a heightened sense of having been left alone for too many days.\"The book is also filled with \"dream bits,\" fragments, \"like the fluttering glints of silver in the dark.\"The message is clear, however... \"Life could deal out worse than Kathryn had had, and worse than that.\"It certainly can.\"A person is not who he had been the day before, Kathryn thought.

It was quick... but every second of the three hours was painful. The book suffered from multiple personalities. The first half was all grieving (fitting for a self help book), the second half attempted to bring in some more mystery and intrigue. Unfortunately the mystery involved was the \"pilot\" having an affair,,, which comes as no surprise to anyone who has worked in the airline industry.

The big revelations that are unearthed seem a bit preposterous and convenient, and the fact that her husband has personal secrets from his wife... well, you could have seen that coming.

Throughout the investigation, Kathryn unknowingly unraveled the hidden life of her husband and discovered the darkest secrets of the man she thought she knew.What she discovered were as unbearably painful as Jack\u2019s death itself. She could not fathom the reason behind Jack\u2019s hiding the truth from her, how he managed to become unfaithful for four and a half years being married to another woman with whom he had two kids.Jack and Kathryn\u2019s family life was extraordinary because they had to deal with frequent absences of the husband due to the nature of his job. They both tried to make arrangements to keep the marriage going but Jack eventually fell in love with one of the flight attendants. Kathryn was busy raising their daughter Mattie and was endlessly waiting for every one of Jack\u2019s homecoming not knowing that he had been living with his other family in a flat in London.She only discovered everything after Jack\u2019s death. There is no Jack to whom she could have poured all of her anger. However, despite the resentment that Kathryn felt, that kind of feeling diminishes whenever she is reminded that those two kids, though of a different mother, are of the same father as Mattie\u2019s.

I was averaging a book a week and now, three weeks have passed with no new reviews. A few people have even contacted me (which I loved) about what I was reading now. Sorry folks, the whole having to get up early to teach the children how to read is interrupting my own leisurely reading time. I'm hoping once the haze of the beginning lifts, I'll be able to get back into a better reading routing. For now, once or twice a month is probably our max. It saddens me, too.Without further ado...The Pilot's Wife by Anita Shreve was given to me in passing. A friend of mine was cleaning out her books and stumbled upon this. Because she was moving, she needed a place for the books to go and allowed me the chance to rummage through the selection. (Don't we love a friend like this!). I picked up The Pilot's Wife and thumbed through the pages, contemplating on whether or not I wanted to read a book that might be too close to home for me, after all, I am a pilot's wife. I decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did.Kathryn Lyons fumbles in the dark when a late night knock comes at her door. (I'm not giving anything away here, this is on page one) There is no other way to interpret the stranger on the front porch. Her husband, Jack Lyons, has been killed in a plane accident. Immediately, she is sucked into a tornado of events. How will she cope? How will she tell her daughter? This opening scene is heart-wrechnig, especially if you are parent. You travel with Kathryn on this journey of loss, hoping that behind each turn there is some good news to follow.As Kathryn, her daughter Mattie, and her grandmother Julia sift through the wreckage of their lives and deflect the horrible stories the media perpetrates during this difficult time, Kathryn begins to wonder if she ever knew Jack at all. Her daughter, a teenager handling the upset in her life the way most teenagers do - with deference and anger and grace depending on which day you catch her - pops off to her mom saying, \"How well does anyone every really know anyone else, anyway?\". Kathryn assures her daughter and herself that she knew Jack, she knew her husband, but as the novel unfolds, we find that is not true; her daughter's wisdom far beyond her own.Kathryn Lyons is a character you follow closely as you read. I think this is because you want so much for her, you want just one page, one moment, to have good news; for her to wake up from this nightmare her life has become. Anita Shreve will tease you a bit, but in the end sometimes life is just not fair.Anita Shreve writes expertly. I felt every emotion, good and bad. Every betrayal leaped off the page into my soul. It is such a well-written novel that I believe anyone would enjoy the reading. It is a women's fiction piece to me and I say this because it's not so literary one has to think all the way through, The Pilot's Wife is a novel with staying power. It was made into a movie in 2002, but didn't boast big name actors. I've not seen the film, and I probably won't; the story in the book was so strong I don't need a visible representation of this work.The Pilot's Wife was selected for the Oprah Book Club and became an international best-seller.Anita Shreve is an author I will read again. She's written several books, many of them best-sellers. She says \"She loves the novel form and writes only in that genre...The best analogy I can give to describe writing for me is daydreaming,\" she says. \"A certain amount of craft is brought to bear, but the experience feels very dreamlike.\"This is a book I would recommend to anyone looking to read a solid story. There is just enough tenderness and love within the mystery and suspense to pull a reader forward, the book is just really good. It's that simple.For more about Anita Shreve visit her website at http://www.anitashreve.com"}, {"userName": "Abigail Hillinger", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63080-abigail-hillinger", "userReview": "This was chick-lit in disguise. I feel dirty and tricked.Although I probably am being harsh by giving it two stars, I don't really see too many good things about this book. The bits where Kathryn are at her house are far too dragged out. Shreve relies only on the 'feel' sensory to explain what her character is going through, rather than the 'show'. The important parts where things could have been really interesting--such as the funeral or the first Christmas without Jack--are glossed over and barely given a paragraph's mention.The characters were predictable most times. Robert, especially, the basically flawless man who does one thing 'wrong' even though it's really not wrong at all. It's 'nobel.' I did like Mattie, though. And her line, 'but how do you ever know that you know a person?' was brilliant. I loved it. This book could have been summed up into a short story, maybe 10 pages long, and that line being the focus.

Unintentionally my small collection on Goodreads has a very common theme! Out of the three recently read- The Pilot's Wife is certainly my favorite. I was visiting my parents last weekend and picked this off of the top of a stack in their laundry room. I don't usually commit to a book without knowing more about it or hearing a recommendation but I'm really glad that I did! I think its the most well written and you immediately get sucked into the characters and the story. Unlike the Silent Wife, this was a page turner for me. I read it in 3 or 4 nights. This book had twists and turns but they didn't feel cheap like they may have in Gone Girl. (Gone Girl felt kind of like a Hollywood best seller to me- good and entertaining and well written for sure with some great disturbing twists to throw you off but not something that would really stick with you) The major theme- in my opinion, was the ability to create your own reality. In this way it was very similar to the Silent Wife. Perhaps Pilots wife is also about things not being as they seem- but the way that each chapter started with a snapshot of life as it was with Jack, meant that there was reality and there was the life that Kathryn wanted to live and she ignored certain details and moments between them to carry this vision out and mold her life to look as she wanted it to. And though she realizes that she was wrong all along, she also continues to do it when she decides at the end that Jack cried out for Mattie as his plane went down. Something she would never know for sure but that would help her cope and make sense of the life they had together.Its like creating a photo album. You throw out the photos that aren't so good or aren't of a particularly good memory but keep the great ones. All of a sudden over time you forget the memories that aren't so good and your reality becomes what you see in the pictures. Unlike Silent Wife, I finished the book feeling tremendous hope for Kathryn. It was a depressing book to say the least but so beautifully written, with fantastic imagery and underlying tones of hope. I actually finished it feeling satisfied and content and immediately recommended it to a friend."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1719023-kelly", "userReview": "I really liked this book more than I thought I would. The reviews I had read (on Amazon, I think) all seemed disappointed and felt that Shreve ended the book prematurely. In this case, I think it was a perfectly fine place to end it. You can guess how the story would continue after all is said and done. You know there might end up being a friendship. You know there probably will be a relationship. Since you know what will probably happen, it's okay.I actually found myself bored in the beginning of the book and felt it dragged on forever. Things really picked up about 3/4 of the way through the book. There is one part of the book where the imagery is so strong that you feel the betrayal, pain, and bitter resentment that Kathryn feels. You just feel livid reading it. It's an excellent passage of writing and SO realistic that you'll find yourself thinking about it (and stewing) for days. It's worth reading for the latter half of the book alone.Maybe I liked this book so much because I'm a former flight attendant...and I saw a few of the topics this book touches on in reality. The fact that it's plausible is what's scary."}, {"userName": "Kerri Duff", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51649609-kerri-duff", "userReview": "3.5A well written novel that kept me interested until the last page. I really enjoyed the way it unfolded and the way things were revealed.  This is the second book by this author I have read and so far I have found them to be a pleasant experience, especially when I'm wanting a lighter read."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54076-cynthia", "userReview": "This is the second Anita Shreve book I've read. I like how the author writes and describes the scenes and emotions. The flaskbacks of her early family life were partically good. Her tone impresses me, although Sea Glass seemed to flow a little better. I was hooked in the beginning and I felt Kathryn's pain. That half of the book I felt was written well but when Shreve attempts the different plot twists during the second half of the book, I lost interest. Which is sad, because those plot twists are primarily there to hold a reader's interest. The revelation about Jack's double life- both romatically and polically came on almost too suddenly. In fact, the political twist was unnecessary and unreal, I would have preferred it if this was left out. As Kathryn said, she didn't understand Jack's motivation and since he's dead she'll never understand it. And I don't expect all the details of this progression of Jack's double life to fall into a neat little package, but I think more details should have been provided maybe through Muire or Robert (partically politically). And we wonder why Jack kept so many secrets, I find it crazy that after ~15 years of marriage he doesn't tell Kathryn the real story of his mom and he's been going to church. Also,little of the book goes into real depth about how Kathryn feels about her husband's betrayal. I thought this book would have been better if the book spent as much time dealing with the emotional repercussions of Jack's betrayal combined with grief as the book did in the beginning of the book with just grief. And lastly, why does Robert fall in love with Kathryn? She's crying, hysterial, emotional, hasn't showered, changed clothes, eaten for most of the book and is griefing another man. What guy in his right mind would fall in love with that. Sympathy and compassion yes but love--give me a break. Oh and what was up with the lottery ticket?"}, {"userName": "C-shaw", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2663695-c-shaw", "userReview": "Reading for my library book club. I didn't think I would care for this and resented paying $9.99 for the e-book, but it's very good and I don't regret buying it at all now.* * * * *This is a fantastic book. As mentioned earlier, I didn't expect to be interested in the story of a widow whose husband died in a plane crash, but there is so much more to the tale. It becomes a mystery to be revealed in small increments as the widow becomes aware that she didn't really know her beloved husband as well as she thought. Well written, very intriguing, makes me want to read more of Anita Shreve's writing."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2850786-jennifer", "userReview": "The Good: Anita Shreve writes well and he books never fail to suck you in, even if you aren't loving where the story is going.The Bad: This was a depressing book with a unrealistic ending. To throw some romance in at the end, as if Kathryn would been remotely stable enough at that point in her life for anything to work out, is ludicrous. She's obviously obsessive about the husband, not able to let go of this \"secret\" even though he's dead and she should just mourn and move on."}], "description": "A pilot's wife is taught to be prepared for the late-night knock at the door.
