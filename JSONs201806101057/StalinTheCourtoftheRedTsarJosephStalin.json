Even Hitler had a few tiny sentimental spots. Stalin doesn't even have that - he is a beast. A terrifying man, and this biography spares no details about the terrors of life around him. His retainers are also fascinating in their own twisted way.

It's clearly the result of a huge amount of research by Montefiore: he seems to have personally interviewed just about every living relative of the major figures, quite apart from the endless reading of archives and memoirs that must have been involved. As a casual reader I found it slightly hard going at times. I didn't do it any favours by largely reading it in bed at night, but even allowing for that, I found it hard to keep track of all the people involved. I found I was having difficulty remembering which was which even of the most important figures, like Molotov, Mikoyan and Malenkov.I don't know if that's an inevitable result of a book with quite so many people in it \u2014 It's not a subject I've read about before, and all the unfamiliar Russian names didn't help \u2014 or if it's my fault for reading it while drowsy, or if there's more Montefiore could have done to fix the various people in my mind. I didn't find I got much sense of their various personalities that would have helped me keep them separate. Still, what I did get was a strong sense of Stalin himself, and his trajectory from a charming (though ruthless) young man living an almost campus lifestyle at the Kremlin, surrounded by the young families of his colleagues, to a sickly, garrulous old despot wandering nomadically from dacha to dacha and living in a vortex of terror and awe.But even a sense of what Stalin was like to live and work with doesn't get you much closer to understanding his motivations and the motivations of people around him. Was it just about power or did he believe to the end that he was acting in the interests of Russia and the party? The inner clique around Stalin clearly knew at some level that all the denunciations and show trials were arbitrary and could attach to anyone: they saw the process happen over and over again. And when colleagues they had known for years confessed to ludicrously unlikely accusations, they surely can't have believed it. But the things they said and wrote suggest that at the same time they sort of did believe it, and remained theoretically committed to the ideology to the end. It made me inclined to reread 1984, because the concept of 'doublethink' is so startlingly apt.In some ways the Stalinist purges are even more incomprehensible than the Holocaust. The Holocaust at least has a kind of simple central narrative: an attempt to exterminate the Jews. It fits into a thousand year history of European anti-Semitism as well as a broader human history of racism and genocide. The purges don't offer any kind of similarly clear story: at different times they focussed on different things. It might be a whole social class, a profession, an ethnicity, or it might start with one or two individuals that Stalin was suspicious of and spread out through their colleagues and families to take in hundreds of people. Targets included kulaks, engineers, doctors, army officers, Poles, Jews, ethnic Germans, Chechens, Estonians, Latvians, Ukrainians, Koreans: in fact any ethnic minority that could provide a possible focus for dissent. The total number of deaths, including not just those executed but those who died in slave labour camps or famine, is disputed; but 20 million is apprently a plausible ballpark figure. At one stage Stalin was setting two quotas for the different regions: the number to be shot and the number to be arrested. These numbers were in the tens or hundreds of thousands, but the regions were soon writing back and requesting that their quotas be extended \u2014 out of ideological zeal? In an attempt to demonstrate their loyalty? Or just because these things have a momentum of their own?It's a staggering story and despite the slight reservations I expressed earlier, this is a very impressive book."}, {"userName": "Jonfaith", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2327886-jonfaith", "userReview": "Christmas time is a tricky time for my friends and relatives.

I went home with this biography and sort of tumbled into its depths.

Stalin's fifties are best described as specializing in ignoring truth. An ostrich with its head buried in the sand had nothing on Stalin. His incompetent management of World War II was truly awful, and his disloyalty and manipulation of friends and their families to their deaths was unbelievable. All in all, he personifies the boss no one wants to work for. Credited with nearly 20 million deaths (I don't think that includes the soldiers lost through his mismanagement of the war), Stalin was most certainly a monster who thought history would ignore his depredations. Thanks to this book, we hopefully will not. I, for one, had no idea Stalin was as cruel as he was. Al Capone was a choirboy in comparison. Both may have been good to their families, but that does not mitigate their criminal tendencies towards murder and mayhem. Now that I have read this book, I can now appreciate Ayn Rand more. Stalin tried to annihilate individualism and then could not understand why he had no one competent left to grow wheat, run factories, do research, etc. Ironically he was in the process of torturing and condemning to death the five greatest Jewish doctors in Russia when he had a stroke and was left to the incompetency of lesser doctors, which killed him. All I can say is, Yes! Serves him right!I'd like to think the world is through producing people like Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Capone, Napoleon, etc. Unfortunately it appears that we are still producing them in Africa and South America and probably other places as well. Scary thought. Hopefully the internet will prevent them from hiding so long from the public eye."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1223795-katie", "userReview": "The trouble with a really good book is that eventually you finish it. Even one that's 700 pages long. After that, your life is basically over. That's what's wrong with this one.We learned precisely jack about Soviet history in school. Aside from the propaganda they ladled out, which was pretty short on recognizable facts. One is left educating oneself, and this is the best the TCL could do on the subject of \"show trials\" and \"Great Terror.\" I still don't know enough about Russian history, evidently. This book glosses over Stalin's early career--who knew there was a Civil War after the Revolution?--and starts out in the mid-20's, just before he got started killing his 20,000,000 people. Stalin and Co. had this interesting policy in 1931 or so of creating instant industry, sort of \"just add water,\" by forcing the peasants to export all their grain to the west. So the peasants had to starve, be deported, or be shot. The Bolsheviks were really into death as a solution to many problems--\"no man, no problem.\"The Kremlin got into WWII through a wall of screeching denial, and for the life of me I can't see how the hell Germany lost the eastern front. The Soviet leadership approached their defense like guys trying to escape a flood by banging holes in the bottom of their boat and shooting at the rescue helicopter. Look at it: A reasonable wartime government encourages its population and military with posters, marching music, slogans, and other jingoistic propaganda. The Kremlin's idea of bucking up the troops was to terrorize anyone who looked a little bit chicken-hearted, plus their families. Case in point: The German army was descending on Moscow; the city was being bombed; there were 90,000 defenders, and what does Stalin do? He has more than 23,000 of them arrested for cowardice. And yet Stalin was apparently personally charming, an enthusiastic scholar, a serious literary critic, and a fine singer who could have sung professionally. He was from Georgia; \"Stalin\" was his nom de guerre, or de revolution or whatever. In the early 1930's, all the Politburo families lived cosily together in flats in the Kremlin, had dinner parties, shared nannies, vacationed together in the Crimea. (Planning massacres.) After the war, things were different: Stalin really was more like a dictator, controlling things from his various dachas, ordering the magnates to all-night dinner parties where they were required to eat till they vomited and try to drink him under the table.It's tempting to try to diagnose a man like Stalin. Was he a psychopath, an Antisocial Personality? He had some antisocial traits, like egregious criminal behavior and a taste for hearing the last words of those he had arrested, tortured and shot. But he was a loving father and a thoughtful friend. Unlike a true psychopath, he had a fine ability to think through consequences, to plan, to weigh alternatives. He could be gentle. No, he wasn't sick. He, along with others, entered into a system that was based on violence, devoted to violence; that believed in \"no revolution without blood;\" that made up enemies where there were none; that trusted lies; that rewarded sycophancy; that punished courage, honesty, and integrity.The author relies on an incredible amount of basic research for this biography--interviews with Stalin's adopted son and the children of his associates, the newly published writings of his underlings, his own letters and those of his family, and histories from both East and West. One of the best things about this 700-page biography is that it is broken up into little short chapters, like this one."}, {"userName": "Manray9", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7288965-manray9", "userReview": "Montefiore's research is astounding.

Well, I have mixed feelings about it. I thought it fascinating when I started, then annoying, then horrifying and fascinating again. The author is clearly impressed by Stalin and seems to consider him far cleverer than the guy really was. Yes, Stalin possessed a certain kind of intelligence - but it was a mean, extremely short-sighted intelligence of a particularly monstrous cockroach. This sort of intelligence was just good enough to keep him constantly at the trough, but it failed to keep him happy or to save his life (when he had the stroke, his henchmen and staff were too afraid to actually help him, and there was no competent doctor around, because he had had them all arrested). The power he enjoyed - I don't know, it was so vast he had to remind himself of it daily, mostly by micromanaging his family and \"friends\". He was so stupid that he has almost caused his country to be defeated during WWII.His achievements are mostly due to the stupidity, laziness and inertia of other Bolsheviks, and the lack of knowledge and imagination of his Western contemporaries. In other words, dude was lucky. Adolph, on the other hand, was not. As a result Adolph is the Big Bad of history and not Joseph.The style and treatment of the subject sometimes got on my nerves. There are a lot of statements which lead nowhere and have no follow-up. Some stuff is just ridiculous, for example the author's claim that Stalin's cruelty and paranoia were induced by his second wife Nadya's suicide, or the speculations on inner thoughts of the members of Stalin's court (for example, how can he be sure whether Klim Voroshilov's wife was jealous of the other ladies' outfits or not?) Also, what he says about the Warsaw Uprising is outrageous - that it was staged in an attempt to stall the Red Army's progress. Seriously, dude... And if the book is an attempt to describe Stalin as a human and not a maligned Commie demon, how come Beria or Yezhov don't get the same treatment, but are \"monsters\" and \"beasts\"? Even Gorky gets the short end of the stick, while he DID know that he couldn't have written the truth about what was going on during the construction of the Belomor Canal. Yeah... Stalin was a good tsar, only his courtiers were evil. Again, seriously, dude... All right, it's not like this all the time, but still I got this vibe especially at the beginning. Look, Stalin had to snap, they were trying his patience, the ladies acted too familiar, some friends were late for the meetings... see what I mean?But it was an interesting read all the same, and the author gets one more star for his sympathy for Babel (who in turn made me angry... what exactly was he doing at the Yezhovs'?!

I may need something lighter -- and soon!Update: I may write some more on this later. At times fascinating, heartbreaking, but also at times a boring read. Montefiore has all kinds of juicy gossip, due to the opening up of old Soviet archives. He takes the new material and attaches it to the history of the period. It works well -- up until WW 2, and then he has to cover a lot of big events quickly -- and this in a 650 page book! In addition, when Montefiore gets to WW 2, I sensed a creeping admiration for Stalin starting to show its head. This is due largely Stalin's sensing the historical moment as the Germans approached the gates of Moscow, and thus holding his ground. Whatever. Chapter 20 (Blood Bath by Numbers) was the keeper, which goes on to describe the \"execution\" of order 00447. Basically this was a death quota order that resulted in the murder of thousands. Such was the Terror. Montefiore suggests that there was some sort of linkage between it and the suicide of Stalin's wife, Nadja. I'm not sure I'm buying into that answering the Why? of the Terror.

It is clearly the product of prodigious research; the author appears to have read every book and memoir that even touches on his subject, and to have interviewed every person that didn't write a book. It gives a real look at the life of those in Stalin's inner circle after his ascension to power and of course, the life of Stalin himself.Though sometimes touted as a biography, Stalin: tCotRT is most certainly not that. It follows the life of Stalin, but more as an MC than true center. There is only brief descriptions of events that precede Stalin as the supreme ruler of Russia. The majority of the book focuses on the time between Stalin's taking of power and the middle of the second world war. Even then it is not a historical recounting of events. It does hit the highlights but clearly the focus is on the kind of lives those in Stalin's court were leading.There's certainly speculation from the author (who, to his credit, almost always labels it as such) but for the most part this books supplies a ceaseless parade of quotes from the men and women themselves. Little details about their lives and style of living. It's not macabre or lewd though many of the prominent characters engaged in egregious violence and perverse lifestyles, so much as it is intensely personal. Details about Stalin's comments on books he would edit, or mentions of children's games occurring while Ukraine was starved to death. Vacations to the South and personal vendettas.Having a background in Soviet history would be helpful before reading this work, but not necessary. It will not, however, substitute for a true history of the time: that's just not how it was written.

The book is exhaustively researched and is pretty lengthy. A lot of the book deals with the 'personal' lives of the Soviet elite during the 1930s and the 1940s. The writing style is a bit laborious and so a substantial part of the book, dealing with Stalinist elite's private lives, is hard to keep reading seriously. However, the book presents the brutalities of Stalinism and how everyone from Stalin to Beria participated in the 'extermination of class enemies enthusiastically with socialist fervour. Montefiore tries to present a holistic picture of Stalin - as a concerned father of his daughter Svetlana, as an intelligent, well-informed, hardworking and patriotic Russian leader, as one who saw 'enemies' everywhere and didn't hesitate to kill large numbers of comrades in order to emerge as the sole leader, as one who was drunk with success after the victory in the war, as one who was always suspicious and paranoid by nature, as one who was lonely towards the end of his life. The author says that he had an innate anti-semitic prejudice even though two of his closest confidantes in the Party were Molotov and Kaganovich, both Jews. Towards the end of his life, he was hostile to most of his long-time comrades and even imprisoned Polina Molotov for four years. Still, when he died, most of his oppressed colleagues wept openly and mourned his loss deeply. This is the most intriguing aspect of the 'Soviet psychology'. I wish the author had thrown some light on this aspect of the 'Stalinist aura'.There was one piece of research in the book that was new and most interesting for me. The author writes that Lavrenti Beria, Stalin's brutal spy-chief, wasn't a socialist at heart. He believed in private property and that he wanted to 'free' eastern europe, close the gulags and allow the ethnic minorities in the USSR to return to their traditional homes and build a outward-looking capitalist Russia. He hoped to do all this after capturing power once Stalin died. One would never have thought that the brutal murderer that Beria was had such a 'liberal' outlook! The author writes that Khrushchev fully participated in the big pogroms in Ukraine of his own volition and that his later memoirs were quite selective in its honesty. The author tries to hint that the suicide of Nadya, Stalin's wife, might have made Stalin brutally suspicious and paranoid subsequently, resulting in the Great Terror of the 1930s. I wish the author had thrown some light on the murder of Trotsky and Stalin's purported role in organizing it.Some of the lighter parts of the book relate to how obsessed the Soviet Party elite was with each other's health and how regularly they wrote long letters to each other. Amongst the elite, only Molotov emerges as a person who had a deep and loving relationship with his wife. Most of the KGB/NKVD bosses emerge as womanisers, obsessed with pornography! The book could have been condensed to half its length and could have dealt less with the personal peculiarities of most of the Stalinist clique.I would recommend the book to anyone interested in Stalin and the Stalinist era in the development of Communism in the USSR."}, {"userName": "Michael Finocchiaro", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro", "userReview": "And I thought I had a repulsive idea of the horrors of the USSR before? Well, this book certainly made me realize how little I really knew. Stalin was capable of kindness and humor with family and friends and yet boundless, sadistic cruelty. Simon Sebag Montefiore writes a fantastic, detailed and gruesome portrait of one of the most prolific murderers of the 20th C. In about 670 breathless pages, we see the rise of the dictator, the terror of the 30\u2019s, the negotiations with Hitler, the near-success of Operation Barbarossa, the comeback at Stalingrad and the post-war horrors in Russia. There are way too many names for my head to recall but the portraits of Beria, Molotov and Krushchev were particularly chilling. There were moments during the forced starvation of the Five Year Plan or during the sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad and particularly during the nearly constant torture of friends, enemies, accomplices and the vast majority of innocent bystanders in the labyrinth of the Lubyanka. I recall walking next to this horrible prison (which now sports a children\u2019s clothing store of all things!) and almost getting sweat running down my back. And this before reading this book and more fully appreciating the depth of violence that men sunk to in there. The other damning evidence that I found hard to digest \u2013 apart from the many anti-Semitic purges and pogroms \u2013 was the excesses of Stalin\u2019s magnates in rape and theft particularly during and after the war. The world\u2019s religions \u2013 and here I include Bolshevism high on the list \u2013 all thrive on an egalitarian message for the masses and yet rich bounty for those at the top. Stalin\u2019s minions were just as bad as those in the Vatican or TV preachers in the American heartland. And yet, they stooped at nothing to destroy others by accusing them of \u201cWestern values\u201d.If you wish to have a better appreciation for this particularly somber, hopeless piece of human history including one of the three greatest human slaughters in history (aside from Hitler\u2019s and Mao\u2019s of course), this is probably an excellent place to start. It is well-written, incredibly well-researched and seeps in detail upon detail. That being said, if you are in a depressive mood, this is probably not the book for you because you will definitely hit bottom at least a few times \u2013 I did in any case. Biggest lesson learned by me: the adage Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely never rang more true than with this particular monster."}, {"userName": "Phil", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11439760-phil", "userReview": "A great book, which doesn\u2019t just rehearse the well- trodden case against Stalin as mass-murderer, but examines him in the context of the Marxist and Leninist theory from which those philosophies\u2019 acolytes optimistically try to exclude him, and also from the point of view of his followers in the Bolshevik Party which built Soviet Russia.In short, Simon Sebag Montefiore establishes, quite convincingly, that Josef Visarionovich Djugashvili was not only a murderous ideologue, but that he was one who based his entire political philosophy quite reasonably on that of his heroes Marx and Lenin, and whose subsequent cult of individual leadership has extended into all subsequent Communism.I\u2019m not even going to bother to explain why Communism is a poisonous and murderous ideology. Both Lenin and Stalin were perfectly clear on that point.
