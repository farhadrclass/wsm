I mean, I guess everything that happened in Lirael was necessary in setting the stage for Abhorsen, but man did Lirael put a damper on the Old Kingdom high I got from Sabriel. In book 2, Lirael was mopey, annoying, and the Mary-Sue from Hell. Sam was pretty angsty, too, and the book felt entirely like exposition with no real pay off at the end (with a long ways to go). Needless to say, I approached Abhorsen with distrust and apprehension, prepping myself for a letdown.AND WHAT IS THIS? LIRAEL UP IN HERE WITH A DECENT PERSONALITY AND ACTUAL CHARACTER GROWTH? SAM COMING OF AGE AND SHAPING UP LIKE A BOSS? MOGGET AND DOG REMAINING THEIR FLY SELVES AS THEY FACE THE CRAZIEST PLOT EVER? Alright, my capslock!Harry moment has passed. And I might have exaggerated a smidge, but seriously. This book was pretty epic. Dare I say, more epic than Sabriel? (Come on! The last third of the book I kept saying, \u201cWhatever are they going to make it out of this!\u201d or \u201cAs if someone ain\u2019t gonna die right now!\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s no way! NO WAY!\u201d\u2014and the first two-thirds of the book I had already been on the edge of my seat!). Now, I\u2019d like to address something that I haven\u2019t really mentioned in my previous reviews of the series. Most noticeably in books 1 and 3, there are really great and subtle messages sent about the gender stereotypes we\u2019ve picked up in our lifetimes. Plenty of my favorite action heroines (be it movies or books) have to inevitably come up against some douche who refuses to answer to a girl of all things (or remember that awesome scene in RotK when Eowyn\u2019s like, \u201cI am no man! You look upon a woman!\u201d and the audience goes crazy and everyone\u2019s fist-pumping?). But, like, the story can be set 200 years in the future, in space, and some jerk acts like it\u2019s the craziest thing in the world to see a woman save the day. That sucks, no doubt, but almost worse is when the story is set in an alternate freaking reality (usually fantasy with magic and dragons and crap), and people are still shamelessly sexist. Like, really, screenwriter/author? It made sense to you to make this completely fictional world hate women, too? But wizards live forever and stuff, right?In the Abhorsen trilogy, the roles of men and women are pretty evenly distributed between the sexes. There are both male and female royal guards and it ain\u2019t no big thang, some tribes have matriarchs and others patriarchs, and the people of the Old Kingdom answer to the female Abhorsen and the King with equal loyalty and reverence. I mean, that just makes sense to me. If magic has existed in a world since the beginning of time, than freaking equal rights should have as well.Anywho, all-in-all, a fantastic book. It somehow successfully made me love Lirael after raging against her so much before, it totally does justice to anything left wanting regarding the mythos of the world in Sabriel (you get to see all of the nine gates of Death, so awesome!), and it kind of outdoes the final battle scene of Sabriel as well\u2026a great conclusion! (Although I wouldn\u2019t say no to another book in the series\u2026)"}, {"userName": "TS Chan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan", "userReview": "Abhorsen is a great conclusion to a narrative arc which started with Lirael, the second book in the series. The two main characters introduced in the previous book, Lirael and Prince Sameth, have now accepted their respective legacies and fate in what is to become a fight for the survival of the very world itself. Finally, we have a lot more action, a lot less moping and some solid character growth with two young protagonists, both who have vast potential stemming from their unique bloodlines. There is also a third point-of-view which surfaced more regularly in this volume - Nicholas, a friend of the Prince from beyond the Wall to the south, who has fallen into the hands of the enemy and was manipulated in bringing forth ancient powers. Braving the overwhelming odds stacked against them, Lirael and Sam, together with the Disreputable Dog and Mogget, have to attempt to stop the enemy from manifesting. Else, all will be lost. As I have mentioned before, the key strength of this series lies in its worldbuilding - a world between Life and Death - and its magic - of the wild and free, and the constructs which aimed to give such magic structure and direction, with which it can also bind and break. The narrative around these fantastical elements progressed through the series with more revelations on the lore surrounding the history of Charter magic, and deeper exploration through Death and its Nine Gates. Given that this third volume serves as the final and climactic act to the story which began in the second, I will not deign to include further commentary on the plot. Even though I struggled a bit with the characters of Lirael and Sam initially, the development of their roles eventually made sense within the context of what they are becoming. In the face of the imminent and overwhelming threat to the world, both not only managed to overcome their angst but each drew upon their respective strengths as nothing but their best will suffice. The tone of the book is engaging throughout, and the narrative grabbed me right from the start.Even though I have not read much of the YA genre, I can safely say that this is probably one of the better ones out there. There is enough depth in the storytelling and characterization, which without the corresponding ages of the main protagonists, one can easily mistake it for just another classic fantasy novel. And I'll say this again - the world and its magic are positively fascinating. I do recommend this series to those who want to read a classic fantasy with a difference.This review can also be found at Booknest"}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "Abhorsen (Abhorsen #3), Garth NixAbhorsen is a fantasy novel by Australian writer Garth Nix, first published in 2003.

Having just finished this, the final book in the Abhorsen Trilogy, I have to say that it RANKS AMONG THE BEST YA FANTASY SERIES I have ever read. The world created by Garth Nix composed of the Northern Old Kingdon (where magic exists) sitting side by side with the South (looking much like an early 20th century city in Europe) is so realistically portrayed that the whole story comes to life. The interplay between these two realms is very well done. Add to that one of the most interesting and original magic systems I have yet come across featuring among other things, free magic (wild and unbound) and charter magic (bound magic expressed through runes or marks), Abhorsens vs necromancers, lesser and greater dead, gore crows, the Great Charters and some amazingly unique free magic creatures and entities. All of these elements are woven together and used so well in the story that narrative always stays compelling and keeps the reader engrossed in the story. This will certainly me on the short list of YA fantasy series that I recommend to friends.

Read \"Sabriel\" and \"Lirael\" before undertaking \"Abhorsen,\" so that you can familiarize yourself with the Philosophy and Geography of Death. Nix isn't into summarization or repetition. He plunges his reader right into a whirlpool of death, animated corpses, and Charter magic. If you don't already know such characters as the Disreputable Dog, the necromancer Hedge, or his bone-headed companion, Nick, you might never figure out what's going on.This book is a direct continuation of \"Lirael,\" with the ex-assistant librarian and her companion, Prince Sameth carrying on the battle against Hedge and the evil he is digging up at Red Lake. Although Prince Sameth was meant to be the Abhorsen-in-Waiting, heir to the powers of 'The Book of the Dead' and the seven bells, Lirael now takes up that role, and Sam seeks his destiny as a descendant of the mysterious Wallmakers, who built the barrier between the magical Old Kingdom and the mundane kingdom of Ancelstierre. The two will need all of the magic they can conjure up against an enemy that threatens not only the Charter, but all living beings.The swirl and cross-currents of life gradually ebb as the dead pass through gate after gate on Garth Nix's nameless river--a river like Styx or Lethe that runs through each of our subconscious underworlds as a legacy of our water-bound gestation. It is an eerie experience to remember that journey of birth--only this time in the wake of the dead--in this marvelous fantasy trilogy."}, {"userName": "Krissa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32158-krissa", "userReview": "So everything I held against Book Two, Lirael, was released in Abhorsen. The book races, literally and figuratively - I read it in a day. The climax is beautiful, BEAUTIFUL, with all the characters you love and hate from all three books playing their part with some powerful punches. It also drags torturously through some characters' descents into madness which is, well, maddeningly written, curse Nix and his talent.

Slowly the pair come to discover what it is: Lirael embraces her destiny as not only the Abhorsen-in-Waiting, but a Remembrancer as well, someone who can See the past like her Clayr sisters can See the future. Sam, relieved he no longer has to deal directly with Death, embraces his destiny as a royal Wallmaker \u2013 his hobby of inventing and his powerful skill as a Charter Mage really pays off.Although this book is a little higher on action than Lirael, I actually forgot how much of it involves travelling and discovering and planning and then action. The action really ramps up in the final third to lead to what I think is possibly my most favourite climax in any book I\u2019ve ever read.Lirael has really come a very long way from being the shy Sightless Second Assistant Librarian locked away in the Clayr\u2019s Glacier \u2013 now she\u2019s a tough warrior who slays the dead, who walks into Death itself to save the world. She\u2019s really quite amazing.Every time I moved back to Sam\u2019s point of view I could almost feel the relief he felt at no longer being responsible for putting down the Dead. I\u2019m so glad his love of inventing magical trinkets paid off in the end. I felt really sorry for Nick, the poor guy was just overwhelmed with evil power. You have to admire his willpower and intelligence though. I\u2019m really looking forward to reading more about him and Lirael in Goldenhand. I was glad to see Mogget actually have a character arc in this besides being snide and sneaky. Although I\u2019ve read this book before I completely forgot what happened at the end and had to have a cry when I realised who wasn\u2019t coming back.Nix\u2019s writing is as always perfectly elegant, giving this novel a feel of a classic high fantasy that will last through the ages. Every time I took a moment to catch my breath we moved on through motivations of the main characters which propelled the narrative forward with ease. It\u2019s not a fast-paced novel all the way through, it\u2019s more like a locomotive that gently picks up speed until you\u2019re suddenly in the third act and there\u2019s no way you can possibly stop because you just have to know what\u2019s going to happen next, and when all else seems lost you wonder how are our beloved characters going to get out of this unscathed?Once more, like Sabriel, this was supposed to be the end of the story. I am so glad Nix can\u2019t keep his mind off the Old Kingdom and went on to produce a few novellas (Across the Wall and To Hold The Bridge, reviewed here), then Clariel and now Goldenhand after this. I love this world, as terrifying as it is, I love the characters, and I love the challenges they have to overcome. I can\u2019t wait for Goldenhand to see more of Lirael and Nick!"}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley", "userReview": "I think probably the best way to describe what it's like to read the Abhorsen trilogy is to compare it to a snowball rolling down a very, very large hill. We are all familiar with this metaphor--it basically implies that the thing being compared metaphorically moves faster and becomes MORE on the way down, whether that thing is the plot or your emotions as a reader, or both. Abhorsen is like this, but also THE SNOWBALL IS ON FIRE.Sabriel introduced the world, the characters (most of them), the magic system, and the stakes. Lirael upped the ante, widening the scope of the world, but also deepening it, and ended with the characters facing the biggest challenge of their lives so far. Abhorsen is almost in its entirety devoted to confronting that challenge, like the whole book is the climax of the series, but it also has its own climax that is even more intense than the rest of the book. And the rest of the book is like a giant rollercoaster ride of emotion and action and scary stuff trying to kill you.But also, remember the snowball? IT'S STILL ON FIRE.I'm not going to say much about the plot of this book except in the vaguest terms. Firstly, that I thought it was a very fitting conclusion to the story built up in the first two books. Secondly, that the ending brought me to tears in a Starbucks. I did not anticipate this happening. I'd read it twice before, admittedly as a teenager, so I thought I knew what I was getting into. I didn't expect to me moved quite so much, particularly on the subject of death. And lastly, I understand why Nix does what he does with the Disreputable Dog, who I think I've made clear is my favorite character, but that doesn't mean I have to be happy about it.My only real complaint is that there wasn't enough of a coda to the events of the series. We only get the smallest inkling of the fates that befall these characters, although I suppose it is rather easy to guess. This is why I was so excited to learn he'd written a novella that takes place after the events in these books and that I'd somehow missed. It doesn't take place in the Old Kingdom, but we do get to check in with a couple of the characters. It filled a need. But also, I have more need. I'm very excited for Clariel in a couple of months, but seeing as how that's a prequel . . . look, Garth Nix. What I'm saying is I want more stories in this world.

I must confess, before I started them I could barely recall them at all, aside from a few episodes from the first book, Sabriel. I had hastily added 3 or 4 stars to them when I transferred them to GoodReads, so they must have had a lasting impression on me for me to do that.Second re-through and I could see a little why I liked them, but they weren't the kind of thing I would love to read nowadays. I have thought about this a lot recently and I think my taste in almost all aspects of my life have changed dramatically since I was younger, so much that, although I absolutely adore Terry Pratchett's Discworld series and would probably count it as my favourite ever, I can remember being younger and not liking it at all.Sabriel was my favourite out of the three. Although it was much shorter, and barely had any plot or character development, it read like a short story and was enjoyable. Lirael and Abhorsen were much the same, though somehow longer. Garth Nix's other series, like the The Keys to the Kingdom are more Young Adult orientated and are far better, probably because he had a bit of practise beforehand.To me, the Abhorsen Trilogy, unlike quite a few other children's books, are written very much with children in mind and I wouldn't consider calling them Young Adult.

The Old Kingdom exists thanks to an ancient binding contract that depends on three bloodlines. And there's an awful lot of people getting killed in this story, more or less in the background, while the descendants of these three bloodlines get the important stuff done. Quite a few of them have names, and a couple are main characters, but there's this strong sense that all the real, important people of this story are the ones with the bloodlines, and the rest are there so that someone can die to demonstrate how dark and desperate the battle is."}, {"userName": "daisy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44520192-daisy", "userReview": "i'm a mess"}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "This was a very satisfying end to an excellent series.

Lirael goes through so much character development in the course of this book, becoming more confident in her powers as Remembrancer and Abhorsen-in-Waiting. Sam becomes more courageous and confident as well, Mogget and the Disreputable Dog are great throughout, and like I said last time, we get a much greater view into Death than ever before. Basically, Sabriel is still my favourite book of the series, but this one's still pretty damned fun. 27/2/2012Somehow, despite adoring \"Sabriel\" and \"Lirael\", I hadn't read this before. So it was nice to finally finish the trilogy! After the cliffhanger ending in \"Lirael\", \"Abhorsen\" throws you straight into the action. The plot raced along, and the changing viewpoints meant that I wanted to keep reading to find out what was happening to the characters who weren't narrating the chunk I was reading. While there have been forays into Death in both of the previous books, this gives us the most thorough journey to date, with Lirael travelling deep into Death to use her birthright as a Remembrancer to find out how to defeat the ultimate enemy. No longer the Abhorsen-in-Waiting, Sameth also discovers a new birthright, one that makes use of his inventive skills. I thoroughly enjoyed this, although the ending did feel slightly rushed. Perhaps it was just because I was so desperate to find out what happened that I didn't take the time to properly appreciate the story and instead kept ploughing on to find out how things would end!"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10762273-sarah", "userReview": "God, was this good.I neglected to write a review for Lirael, but that's mainly because a) that book and this one feel essentially like two halves of a longer, LOTR-style novel, and b) I read the two of them so close together that I can't even quite remember the dividing line between them.I just finished the book approximately five minutes ago, so my thoughts aren't entirely coherent yet. Let me try, though.1) Everybody lives! Just this once, Rose, everybody lives!2) The Dog. I just sat here with tears rolling down my face. On paper, such a goofy trope (furry sidekick who saves the day, pshaw! yawn!) but so satisfying and well-executed that I have absolutely no shadow of a complaint.3) Mogget did the right thing in the end! Thank goodness. I was getting worried. 4) Can I take just a moment to talk about gender in these books? Not only are a goodly portion of the heroes (and arguably the ones with the most agency and power) female, but there appears to be no sexism in Nix's story. Women are assigned as guards to the king and queen, as soldiers, as saviors, and literally *no one* pauses for an instant to remind the reader that these characters are only pretty good \"for a girl\". THIS is what fantasy should deliver much more often: if you are creating your very own world from thin air, what's to stop you from making men and women equally capable and having no institutionalized sexism beyond charms classes at Wyverley?

Some might find it exciting and adventurous but I simply found it tiring. When they reach Ancelstierre, they must stop stop stop the hemispheres hemispheres hemispheres from joining joining joining. Seriously, I lost track of the number of times they repeated that. That was their one purpose in life. That was the only reason they kept go go going. Bleh.This book is about an apocalypse. The dramatic purpose of having an apocalpse is for the readers to fear for the end of the fictional world. However, to accomplish this, the world must first be shown to have people living in it, people who it would be tragic to lose before the end of their time. It doesn't. Apart from the aforementioned main characters, Sabriel and Touchstone, the reader doesn't know any other substantial characters from this world.

Also a good read, and different enough from the first to keep me interested. I liked reading about the Clayr, and the angstiness of the characters really drew me in and made me care more about them. Abhorsen just fell flat in comparison. There was absolutely nothing new or exciting. And it was too simplistic. Good vs. Evil. No moral dilemmas, no epiphanies, no character growth. And the plot lacked mystery and tension. Honestly, by the end of it, I was just begging for a giant meteor to come and destroy the world, just for a little excitement.

I like the Disreputable Dog character (though I suspect most readers will put together who she and Mogget are) it's still a nice touch.

I was frustrated in book two with his \"boy oh boy did Sabriel and Touchstone have a ton of adventures you don't know about\" story beginning only lead into the at times stupefyingly dull story he did relate. The final climax here is (I suppose) worth the wait as Lerial faces off with Hedge the necromancer who is serving the Destroyer ( I wonder if Hedge had managed at some point to become ruler would it have been a \"Hedgemony\"...okay, sorry about that, couldn't resist). With Lerial in Death and Sam trying to hold off the dead hands etc. It sets up a nice set piece sort ending, the two sides coming together (Sabriel, Touchstone, Ellimere, Sanar and Ryelle (of the Clayr), Sameth, The Disreputable Dog (Kibeth) and even Mogget (Yrael) face off against Orannis the destroyer and \"re-bind It\".

Before I start the new book I wanted to reread the original books again though and Abhorsen was just as fantastic as I remembered it being. It picks up the story almost immediately after the ending of the last book so Lirael and Sam are fighting against the clock to stop the necromancer Hedge from releasing an ancient and terrible power into the world. The fate of the entire kingdom is in their hands and with Sabriel and Touchstone across the wall in Ancelstierre Lirael and Sam only have the Disreputable Dog and Mogget to help them.The world building in this series is phenomenal, I love the river of death with the various gates and the way that necromancers are able to use the seven different bells to control spirits and move make them move through the gates. The bells are just as dangerous to the person ringing them though and wielding their power tends to corrupt the necromancers who use them. The Abhorsens aren't like most necromancers because they use the bells in a different way but they are in just as much danger when they step into the river. I love how Garth Nix describes the river, the gates and the creatures that roam there, he's great at writing creepy scenes and makes it incredibly easy to picture what is happening.The previous book had a lot of set up but here we get to see exactly what is going on with Nick and how he was tricked into helping Hedge. The free magic is having a huge impact on Nick and even though he suspects something is wrong he can't quite seem to focus long enough to figure out what is happening to him. This story starts with a bang and the tension continues to build until the explosive climax when our heroes are in for the fight of their lives. I don't really want to say too much about the plot so I'm going to focus more on the characters here. Lirael has really come into her own since she learnt about her true heritage, she is doing a lot of learning on the fly but she is determined to do whatever it takes to stop Hedge from achieving his goals. Sam has also done a lot of growing up and now he isn't under pressure as the Abhorsen in waiting he is able to get past his fears and find his own way to help Lirael. the Disreputable Dog and Mogget remain two of my favourite characters, they're just so much fun and I always enjoy the banter between them, they're also both incredibly powerful in their own right and here they have to decide how they're going to use that power.Abhorsen was a brilliant conclusion to the original trilogy but I'm excited to revisit this world and meet a whole new set of characters in Clariel.
