In fact it was a little unclear to me what was in the urban suburbs and what was in the city. Several generations are represented, and tales are told of marriages, good and failed, deaths, hopes. It is nicely written, although I found that I got generationally confused at times, uncertain whether the tale being told was that of a contemporary of an older person. Still, in all, I enjoyed it. The writing is rich with detail. It is not a slam dunk recommendation, but a good book nonetheless.=============================EXTRA STUFFAice McDermott's personal and FB pages"}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5328471-danielle", "userReview": "Isn't it funny how readers can have such vastly different reactions to the same book? I think I loved Alice McDermott's At Weddings and Wakes for just the reasons many other (Amazon) readers panned it. Too wordy? Beautifully lyrical. And actually I felt that she told her story with a perfect economy of prose. Pointless and plotless? Maybe we didn't read the same book. This is not a plot-driven story by any means, it's all about an Irish-American family living in Brooklyn in the 1950s and 60s. It's not a difficult read, but the structure is slightly complex and she does ask of the reader for their attention and a certain active participation in the storytelling process. Chick lit? No, we didn't read the same book. If a story is primarily about women does that make it boring chick lit? I suspect you already know how I feel about that one. Yes, there is much about the inner lives of women in this story, which I didn't find the least boring (just the opposite as a matter of fact) and definitely no less worthy than any other subject an author chooses to write about. I guess it all comes down to personal taste, right?I'd say it's a nod to the author's abilities that it took me well into the middle of the book to realize that the chapters could almost be read as interlinked short stories (of course I'm partial to short stories, too), though the book is classified as a novel. Best to consider it as novel that is episodic in nature. I was too caught up initially in the beauty of the prose and the story(ies) she was telling to pay as much attention to how it is crafted to be honest. It's told from the perspective of three children, keen observers despite their youth of the faults and foibles, petty grievances, unhappiness and discontents as well as moments of pure bliss and enlightenment of their tight-knit extended family.Twice a week in every week of summer, save for their summer holiday at the end of July and beginning of August, Margaret, Bobby and Maryanne travel from their home in Long Island to that of their grandmother's in Brooklyn. It's a ritual that includes a stop at a local candy shop for butterscotch Life Savers, bus and train rides and the purchase of warm, floury bread, the sort that \"Christ ate at the Last Supper\", to bring to Momma's. Momma is Lucy's stepmother, and the children's grandmother. She's also the sister of Lucy's mother who died in childbirth. Four daughters Annie and Jack had before departing the world. Momma took up caring for the girls and eventually married Jack adding a son to the brood before Jack decided to die, too.Lucy's life is not how she imagined it would be. In her mind she thinks about leaving her husband and she discusses this possibility to Momma and her sisters, but at the end of the day when her husband arrives to take her and the children home, she fixes her hair and reapplies her lipstick and returns once again to her life. Her three sisters life spinster-lives with Momma, but John has left. Both John and Veronica, the youngest daughter--the one who never knew her mother--rely too much on alcohol to see them through life's difficulties. The story of each adult sibling, as well as Momma's life is touched upon and reflected on. Some small or big event as witnessed by the children becomes the focus in turn. Agnes, the eldest leads a refined and cultured life as a career woman with elegant tastes and a decided opinion about how life should be lived. May was once a nun, but left the religious life behind when she became too dependent on it--loved it too much. She has a second chance at happiness when a romance sparks between her and the mailman. So smitten by her he sends her flowers every week. And Veronica, the youngest, leads a life once hopeful but tinged by sadness as she carries with hera scar on her face. She's a little too reliant on the cocktails that Agnes mixes to perfection for her sisters and Momma. It's not just weddings and wakes that bring the family together, even though a cousin jokingly tells the the children \"aren't you glad that you only have to see your relatives at weddings and wakes?\", though the story is peppered with them. They're just the more obvious symbols of the joys and sadnesses that fill the lives of this family. A strength of the story is how representative their stories are of the greater world around us, no matter what the period. Maybe Alice McDermott is not for everyone, but she is definitely for me. Why did I wait so long to pick this book up? It has been sitting patiently on my bookshelf for its turn for far too long (why I need to keep reading from my own shelves). I won't wait so long to read another book by her and am now off to scan my shelves for my copy of That Night, which I've heard many good things about."}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette", "userReview": "Jumpy and almost entirely in the \"now\" of life. Without knowing what is forward coming, and in the minutia of all the moments that are repeated. And repeated. The rituals, the core of connections for this family- especially with the sisters and Momma! This is a novel that some will find extremely boring, I know it. I find it utterly enthralling. In detail after detail so immensely accurate to a time and place. And to an entire set of \"eyes\" that were shared by thousands and thousands. Life and death with a near absence of \"poor me\" or \"poor us\" involved in the picture at all. But also misguided and unable to disconnect clinging and needy attentions to the anchors- in that original birth family of 4 girls and a boy.It's hard to understand because of the form in which it was told. Which I think was PERFECT for all its inconsistencies and non-context \"she's\" and \"oldest daughter\" or time frame mish-mash connections. Because that's exactly how life surprises and brains \"remember\" the past and the NOW. There is lots of missing information always- it's called \"the future\".You get this book in bits and pieces, just as you did as a kid. You got to \"know\" by the side looks and the adult sighs and the order of operations that was \"different\". Heads up!All of us have our moment \"before\". As the kids did in the summer cabin shrieking about the slug on the floor- just mere minutes before Mrs. Smiley knocked so late on the door.You may like this more if you are American Irish and of an age, but maybe not. I think it is as skilled and equal to Someone in the sense of the pure everyday and ordinary of courage, family, faith and marriage. And as such a nearly perfect reflection of how real daily life \"feels and acts\" with our \"poor Veronicas\" and our trusted harbors of belief strengths always with us. And yet STILL a yearning to \"more\" always aside it.For me, the 2 or 3 buses plus the el ride to Momma's was 6 star."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10241810-leslie", "userReview": "Well - this book should have been a fantastic read - there was a powerful story here with lots of potential - however the author's over descriptive language made it hard to understand at times. The story was written in the third person - she and he - however - you sometimes didn't know who you were following - who's thoughts - actions etc. At one point, they are talking about the dad arriving - and how he dropped dead at the top of the stairs - I reread that several times before I realized they were in the past - and it was the father of the now adults - not the father of the children in the story; another time I finally got the gist that I was following the dead mother - the one who had died in childbirth - but it never told me that I was listening to her thoughts until the end of the chapter when the author revealed that one of the daughters was reading her journal. The grandmother (the real mother's sister who married their father) and the children's mother (Lucy) - were both referred to as \"Momma\". That also added to the confusion of knowing who you were following. The author also took us out of sequence - so we were in the summer of the tragic event and the fall after that before flipping back to the fall before, going through Christmas and spring and into the summer and the wedding - before finishing up at the vacation cottage the day before the news of the tragedy arrived. Alice McDermott is praised for her ability to story tell - and I'm going to have to read something else she wrote to know whether her writing style just doesn't mesh with my reading style or whether this book was an anomaly. I really think there was a much better way to tell this story - that would have been clear, concise and she could have used all her descriptive language - and brought us a beautifully tragic story. But she followed her own route - which left me confused and rereading passages over and over again because I was lost."}, {"userName": "Sally Brock", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11163028-sally-brock", "userReview": "Reading this book was like watching a family portrait being painted. Stroke by stroke, layer by layer, living, dead, named and un-named relatives emerge like ghosts who cannot be fully present. It allows wrenchingly intimate details of a family of Irish immigrants playing out their long held repressions, fearful, protective of their frailties and cautious of the new world around them. Within this family the youngest daughters, never named in the novel, try to make sense of the fragments of truth their family is occasionally willing and able to share. I loved it but, hell, I'm half Irish and found it a bit like reminiscing over an old family album and wondering where everyone went."}, {"userName": "Dan Friedman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54028986-dan-friedman", "userReview": "At Weddings and Wakes is Alice McDermott's third novel, published in 1992. It's a novel that will likely appeal to admirers of McDermott's other novels, and likely won't appeal to readers who found McDermott's other novels boring or uneventful. At Weddings and Wakes is told through the shards of childhood memories of two sisters and their brother, now presumably adults. Like most childhood memories, their memories often seem incomplete and fogged, mixing together the seemingly trivial with major life events, with little to distinguish the one from the other. At Weddings and Wakes focuses on the quotidian: the three siblings' twice weekly summer trips with their mother from their Long Island* suburban home into Brooklyn to visit their mother's stepmother and their mother's three unmarried sisters, still living together in the walk-up apartment in which they were raised; the annual two week summer beach vacation on the tip of Long Island; experiences with nuns at elementary school. In At Weddings and Wakes, the quotidian is punctuated by two unexpected events: the courtship and wedding of May, the unmarried aunt who was formerly a nun, and her death four days later. McDermott makes no secret of these events: she offhandedly tells the reader at several points throughout the novel that May dies young. The novel ends with the \"first timid tap at the glass of the front door\" on an early morning at the rental beach cottage, with McDermott again casually telling us how the three children learn of their aunt's death. As McDermott de-emphasizes surprising her readers in At Weddings and Wakes, similarly McDermott de-emphasizes extensive character development. Perhaps the most complete individual portrait is of May, who \"when she'd left the convent she had understood fully that it was not because she'd lost her vocation, only settled into it too perfectly.\" And the most complete group portrait is of the three unmarried aunts. Here are the three children's memories of their aunts on holidays: \"they would tell each other later, much later, as teenagers or adults, when had there ever been a Christmas or an Easter, a gathering of any sort, when one of them had not disappeared, retreated to a bedroom or crossed the outside hallway or torn off down the street (hadn't Aunt May once spent an entire evening on the fire escape?), just to prove what? That life would indeed go on without them, that they would have no part of the joy. Just to prove, perhaps, no matter that the children on that Christmas had proved them to be wrong, that like the dead their presence would be all the more inescapable when they were gone.\"By rejecting surprises and dramatic revelations and minimizing individual characterizations, McDermott keeps our focus on the core of At Weddings and Wakes: the m\u00e9lange of childhood memories. In McDermott's telling, many of these memories are especially sensuous: the screen door closing \"with what sounded like three short, sorrowful expirations of breath,\" no doubt due to its pneumatic closer, \"the notes of the organ [that] seemed to build a staircase in the bleached air above their heads and then to topple it over\", that \"rat-tat-tat of Momma's pressure cooker\"; the sights of a \"slate path that intersected a neat green lawn, each piece of slate the exact smooth color, either lavender or gray or pale yellow, of a Necco candy wafer,\"of the \"bars, prison bars, a wall of bars, and, even more fantastically a wall of revolving doors all made of black iron bars\" that greet the children exiting the Brooklyn subway station,** of the yellow cane-rattan subway seats; the distinctive cooking odors of the old Brooklyn apartment building.At Weddings and Wakes revolves around fragmentary memories, and not individual events or characters. As an admirer of McDermott, I found At Weddings and Wakes touching and even engrossing, although not up to her best novels. It's difficult for me to rate any McDermott novel using any benchmarks other than McDermott's novels. Compared to McDermott's other novels, of which I've read seven of eight, I rate At Weddings and Wakes as a 3.5, rounded up to a perhaps generous 4.*While Brooklyn sits on Long Island, it's not of Long Island. For a New Yorker, Long Island is distinct from Brooklyn. **And those same bars need to be navigated when leaving many New York subway stations today."}, {"userName": "P", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7260321-p", "userReview": "At Weddings and Wakes reads like a preparatory novel to\nCharming Billy\n. I understand why the former has remained a critical darling: the prose is striking and tender, the scenes somehow encapsulate an entire generational milieu, it\u2019s sad and poetic. But it\u2019s too poetic for this reader; or rather, it tries too hard to be. In spite of the lovely writing, it\u2019s overly ephemeral, abstract even. There\u2019s little plot, which would be fine if there was something to hold on to; there isn\u2019t much. The weakest sections by far are from the children\u2019s perspectives: in this novel, at least, McDermott does not have a knack for writing realistic child characters.

Very detailed descriptions which are sometimes comic, but more often elegiac, of trips on bus and subway to visit a grandmother and several aunts in Brooklyn and by car to the shore for vacation on the far end of Long Island. It's a short novel best savored a couple of chapters at a time.

It is lyrically beautiful, a portrait of a family (in the words of another reviewer). The happenings of this family are revealed in the same way we see details in a painting, sometimes in a seemingly random order, sometimes with a hint that slowly develops into something greater, and often from a variety of perspectives that let us slowly see an image of truth. I love books that are page turners, but I also love books that let you sink into the characters. Alice McDermott has certainly produced a glowing portrait of the family's unexpected joys and sorrows. These are also the joys and sorrows that will resonate with many families as we continue through ordinary life.

It's just not as good as Charming Billy or Someone, which were extraordinary. At Weddings and Wakes takes us into the relationships in a family who live out their lives between weddings and wakes as really, when you stop to think about it, we all do. This story of four sisters who have taken different paths in life is so honest that I felt like i knew them. The wedding of one sister was written with near perfection with the family interactions, tensions, love, and joy.

This is not a negative thing to say, however, because the little that does happen is so well explained to us, the perceptions of the characters are so nuanced, that it feels as though each scene is full and satisfying. I love her style of writing--and I don't say that lightly. I wondered, though, after reading this book, if what gives her the room to write such beautiful and fleshed out sentences is the fact that the story IS so slow moving and detailed. Her style would not lend itself well to a thriller, certainly! The family whose life she explores in At Weddings and Wakes is not a happy bunch, but each piece of joy that comes their way is fully felt by the reader."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/854903-mary", "userReview": "I didn't like this book at first.

This story is told by an omniscient narrator, but it's from the children's point of view, and the events aren't chronological. McDermott does a great job of telling the story in pieces, much like our fragmented memories from childhood. We find out major events in an offhand way; then the story backs up and takes us to the scene. Knowing what's going to happen doesn't spoil the book; it makes it more poignant, as if we are thininking back on our own lives.

Though it's a book where not much happens, at least not on the surface, tragedies and regrets small and large permeate it.

The children see what is going on during their family visits, but they don't understand the lives of the adults. Lucy's sisters May, Veronica and Agnes still live with their step-mother in the same apartment that they lived in as children. The secrets and painful memories of the family are slowly revealed to us, the readers, as we gradually understand the sacrifices that Mrs. Towne made to keep the family together during a time of tragedy.I love the minute details that Alice McDermott used to describe the everyday scenes on the bus, in church, and in Momma's house. Even the scenes in the bungalow on the beach are true to the children's perspective, right down to the squeals of the girls over the sight of a slug on the floor.

Life, love, relationships, people and how they deal with the things life brings them. McDermott's writing style takes a little getting used to, as she heaps description on the reader, few names, and jumps around in time. But once you get into it, it all makes sense, and her understanding of human nature is revealed, along with, for me, a nostalgic look into growing up in the 1960's."}], "description": "Twice a week, Lucy Dailey leaves suburbia with her three children in tow, returning to the Brooklyn home where she grew up, and where her stepmother and unmarried sisters still live. Aunt Veronica, with her wounded face and dreams of beauty, drowns her sorrows in drink. Aunt Agnes, an acerbic student of elegance, sips only from the finest crystal as she sees Aunt May, the ex-nun, blossom with a late and unexpected love. And all the while, the children watch, absorbing the legacy of their haunted family. At once a moving evocation of life's inexplicable calamities and a magical celebration of childhood and familial love, AT WEDDINGS AND WAKES is the story of three generations of an Irish-American family through the eyes of its youngest members. With eloquence and grace, master storyteller Alice McDermott transforms everyday experience into the heroic and universal.", "title": "At Weddings and Wakes", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126849.At_Weddings_and_Wakes", "average": 3.52, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348080300l/126849.jpg", "reviews": 131, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7505.Alice_McDermott", "name": "Alice McDermott"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Novels", "Abandoned", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126849.At_Weddings_and_Wakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1235818.At_Weddings_and_Wakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28262673-at-weddings-and-wakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6617007-at-weddings-and-wakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1235823.At_Weddings_and_Wakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332207-someone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11773.Charming_Billy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33931059-the-ninth-hour", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72609.After_This", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/384758.Child_of_My_Heart", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
