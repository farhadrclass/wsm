The criminals in the fictional (future?) world have acclimatized to this new wave of policing and now wear masks to hide their identity, which means good old fashioned policing is still paramount to catching a killer. In Punishment, a killer is terrorizing the populace and taunting the police by brutally murdering unsuspecting and seemingly random victims with a pick axe and leaving cryptic clues at the murder scene for the likes of Detective Barnes and his partner Franklin to decipher.This is an inventive book which not only introduces some cool tech into the crime fictional realm but also provides the real world implications of such technology on the open market; b-grade celebs selling memories, prostitutes selling weird and wonderful experiences at a price, and addicts known as munkey's who can't get enough. And the perhaps the best part of the 'machine', the ghost memories which live on in those who experience the transference. The criminal element itself is pretty straight forward serial killer and the protagonist conforms to the tried and true genre troupes, however, these are both a positive and complimentary to the complexities introduced by the technology. My rating: 5/5 stars. This is a great start to a new series featuring a troubled Detective who himself looks like being on the brink of sanity - I mean, how long can someone function with a bunch of murdered peoples dying memories? One of the top new books of 2018."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma", "userReview": "Despite the futuristic tech, most of this story isn't anything new. World weary, Machine addicted, and psychologically damaged Detective Barnes is searching for a murderer in the siphoned memories of his victims. Plugged into a device that replays their last moments at full sensory levels, he is taunted by a serial killer whose crimes had already tipped the last investigator over the edge. It all sounds pretty interesting, but is let down by the poor characterisation, especially the unlikely redemptive relationship that develops between Barnes and a beautiful, young, clever woman- some serious wish fulfilment going on here I think. Also, the way the Machine works doesn't quite fit in with the wider uses of it in the world. Someone's final moments are taken so that clues about their killer can be seen by detectives once they are plugged it, yet continuous use apparently moves across their whole personality, so much that they can talk to Barnes and respond to outside stimuli- even take over his speech if he isn't paying attention. Surely having investigators with a whole collection of vying victims 'living' in their minds is hardly ideal? This is hinted at during the book, Barnes is the subject if a journalistic investigation into the pitfalls of using the Machine, but i'm not sure where it leaves the potential for the future?Even so, Holliday does some great work with the way really the tech is being used in the background, this is where it kicks into feeling like a real, almost inevitable extension of contemporary society. The whole Machine experience is akin to a hardcore street drug, desperate individuals escaping their lives in the memories of others, with zombie like junkies on the streets, lost in borrowed adventures and whoever traces are left behind on their own psyche- sometimes to the extent that their own 'self' is lost. Criminals are punished by reliving their acts over and over again, but from the perspective of those they hurt- all the pain and trauma over and over for years, a physical and mental scarring of forced empathy. Then there are the stars of the day, and those looking for money and fame, selling their own memories- that once in a lifetime goal or sexual experience with that model or actor, all are fodder for the Machine- and for people willing to pay hard cash to be someone else, even for a short time. Again, this is somewhat problematic with the way the Machine actually works for Barnes, each sale would give over way more info than desired.. where the seller lived? Where they keep their money? Online passwords? Their whole damn lives....???Despite some good moments, it's not something that grabbed me enough to continue."}, {"userName": "Dee Arr", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60710386-dee-arr", "userReview": "Author Scott J. Holliday\u2019s \u201cPunishment\u201d has a lot going for it. It contains a great plot idea wrapped in a mystery/thriller story, nicely helped by talented writing. There are a few elements that bothered me about the book, but none that would cause me to encourage others to leave it on the shelf.The author\u2019s overall theme, a world where memories are chipped and sold, is not new. However, the twist of using the science as a tool to aid in police investigations is something I haven\u2019t read before (I do recall there was a movie some years back with similarities, but there is plenty of originality in this book that sets it apart). Mr. Holliday spends time educating readers exactly how this science works and even personalizes the machine the detectives use (the main character, John Barnes, hooks up to a machine the department has named \u201cEddie\u201d). The author is very exact on this science, which is the foundation for the book. His subsequent description of the science and its effects add an additional layer of subtle horror as readers experience the story through Detective Barnes.The story is neatly packaged, providing the clues left by a psychopathic killer and then leading readers to a realistic ending that neatly ties all the story threads together. The author\u2019s writing is descriptive and entertaining, at times presenting images in a unique way (\u201c\u2026the Barnes brothers\u2019 bedroom looked like a resale shop had barfed in it\u201d). Detailing what is necessary and writing in an engaging manner are two of the author\u2019s five-star efforts.While it slightly bothered me that a police detective wouldn\u2019t know the proper terminology for his gun (magazine, not clip), it was the author\u2019s excellent description of the science that also served to illuminate a potential flaw in the story. Mr. Holliday is very clear that that memories of the killer\u2019s victims are being built into the host\u2019s brain (the only time the words \u201c\u2026someone else\u2019s consciousness\u2026\u201d are used is in the From the Editor section when she describes the book). It is apparent to readers that something else is going on, but the story never addresses this. Perhaps the author thought it was obvious, but as it was his words that produced the setting for the tale, I hoped he would enlarge upon this element in the storyline. I also thought the relationship with Jessica was a bit forced and could have been embellished, which would have granted her more realism and less appearance as nothing more than a plot device.Overall, a good blend of scifi and a thriller. \u201cPunishment\u201d is a quick, easy read that was entertaining and enjoyable.

It was a difficult choice, with real competition this month and at least 4 out of 6 of those on offer which got my interest. In the end it was this that won out, the machine..... I just had to know more.The concept of a machine that can tap into and then replay not just memories, but physical sensation, pain, fear, love, the whole gamut of human emotions, taken from a person and then played into the mind and body of someone else, is mind bending stuff. The possibilities and the consequences, many of which would never have even occurred to me had the author not crafted a story around them in intricate detail like a true artist.Intelligently written and thought provoking. I could see this as a blockbuster movie and perhaps a sequel?Great book, well written with the pace of a racehorses run wild and I have no hesitation in recommending it. Something a little bit different, but if you like mind bending, psychological thrillers then why not give it a go, you won't be disapounted!

We've got our damaged, self-hating, weary detective (very unoriginal) who hooks himself into a machine where he relives his homicide victims' deaths to solve the crime. While we do learn about why the detective believes he deserves punishment, the reader never feels it. The detective is Mr. Macho, sad and misunderstood, always doing more than he should, risking his well-being, but somehow always pulling through... of course, you don't connect to his struggle, it just is. While pursuing the case, he interviews a school teacher who, for some strange reason, is instantly attached to this damaged man. True to the male fantasy, she's beautiful and always knows the right thing to say and do to ease his pain... and let's not forget the rest of the fantasy where he gives absolutely nothing back to her in return... unless the booty call is supposed to be her reward. It turns out that this machine he's using, not only allows him to relive the last 5 minutes of someone's life, but it also leaves the residual of other people's personalities in his brain and they often speak their opinion. It's ridiculous to imagine that any employer would ever allow this to be part of someone's job. They'd be paying out millions in workers' compensation claims and would be fighting endless lawsuits. Now perhaps if this side effect was only happening to the main character and the author dug into emotional ramifications, this could be interesting."}, {"userName": "Chandra Claypool (wherethereadergrows)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9722719-chandra-claypool-wherethereadergrows", "userReview": "What an absolutely unique look into how future crime may be solved. I couldn't even begin to imagine what it would be like to be able to see the memories of not only the living but the dead too. The absolute weight it must put on someone not only mentally but physically would be cumbersome and surely cause their mind to break itself... eventually. Barnes has seen past users of this machine end up in a ward for the criminally insane. He swears he doesn't \"need\" the machine and that he can bring himself back to the surface at any time.... but can he really? The closer he gets to solving this crime, the closer he gets to losing himself in the process. Let's talk about this cover for a moment. I LOVE sugar skulls! Although after this read, I may see them slightly differently. My favorite colors, with my favorite skull and I can see this absolutely being a cover buy. Add this to such a unique storyline and well, who wouldn't be sold!!Here's some things that just didn't quite work for me. Throughout the book, we see Barnes \"hearing\" different voices and these are italicized ... but at the beginning it's not quite clear what is going on so it was a tad bit confusing to see this. Once I realized what was going on it made more sense. I did feel the relationship between Barnes and Jessica felt a bit forced and just thrown in there as a romantic arc and to have someone he cares about get thrown into the mix. I think the book would've worked just fine, if not better, without this at all. I would have liked to have seen more about the machine itself - the background of how this came about and how it became not only a means for punishment, helping to solve crimes and for entertainment for some. This absolutely fascinated me.What absolutely did work for me was the uniqueness of it all. We have seen some touching on this type of science fiction in movies and books in the past but this took on a bit of a different take. I could also see this happening at some point. Celebrities downloading their memories so the every day person can spend a day in their shoes/memories and get a break from their own reality. **Shiver** A bit scary, but I like scary so...... Those who like that sci-fi mixed with crime will definitely enjoy this novel. As book one in a series, I am intrigued to see where this could potentially go and maybe I'll get the answers I'm seeking later on.

The world of this novel is just like ours, with one additional technology: people can download memories into their own brains. This is especially useful for homicide detectives, who \"plug in\" to their victims to get a first person view of their demise. In addition to personal demons and alcoholism, our lead character, the detective, is struggling due to having seen/experienced/been so many murder victims in his relatively short time in homicide. The author does a good job of making you feel as discombobulated as the detective is, with fragmented dreams and memories surfacing during the main narrative. It can be a little confusing until you figure out that that is what he is doing (and still sometimes even then), but as I said, it adds to the atmosphere of the novel and putting you in the detective's head. The female love interest is not handled with any subtlety; she is a fantasy version of a woman who immediately loves our hero and wants to help and please him in every way within minutes of meeting him. That's fine, because the story isn't really about her, but it was jarring and blatant enough to interrupt my suspension of disbelief. In other words, this female character was the most unrealistic part of a world in which people can download each other's memories! Still, I really enjoyed it, and won't say more about the serial killer/plot to avoid spoilers. This is a fun read, and would recommend it to serial killer/noir fans who want a twist."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11287377-sharon", "userReview": "Really interesting conceptsI thoroughly enjoyed this take on the machine and it's side effects.

This very tired setup is given a new twist in Punishment with the introduction of The Machine, a plugin and drug combo that captures short term memories stored in the hippocampus. Once those memories are recorded they are then accessible to anyone else willing to jack in. If that technology angle sounds familiar too, it's because it is only just a little less tired than the gumshoe trope. Natalie Woods' last film, Brainstorm had this exact technology, and Faye Dunaway's murder thriller Eyes of Laura Mars this exact premise, and what about Minority Report which had the more interesting ability to predict crimes in advance? Now smashing up two tired tropes can be interesting, but it requires that something be added that appears at the intersection. This book adds nothing. The Machine, which is introduced as a critical tool of law enforcement, plays absolutely no part in the actual case work. Even worse it is proven to be absolutely destructive to the people who use it, so why would you put your trained police staff on this machine since it drives them insane? Then there is what really bugged me the most, the Machine does not work as described. Memories taken from the hippocampus would convey emotions and events, but what we find is that the Machine implants entire personalities, personalities that occupy Barnes' mind with him and respond to stimuli. If there is an original angle to this novel it is this occupation angle on a memory transfer (although personality transfer plots are also dime a dozen), but it simply doesn't make sense as a result of the described process. These memories scraped from the short-term memory process also haul in incredible amounts of long term memories, which Holliday seems to think are also in the hippocampus rather than simply accessed during an event. If memory transfers transplanted personalities then everyone who wrote a well-written memoir would then also get a copy of the author in their head. Even more problematic is that this aspect really makes this machine entirely undesirable as a law enforcement tool. Why would a police force want their detectives to be conflicted by murder victims? Even more so, why would you want your armed officers be subject to possession by those traumatized victims? Is Barnes somehow special in this regard? At least one other person in this novel is occasionally possessed by their inner voices as Barnes is, which suggests that Barnes is NOT special. Furthermore this aspect opens the question of why anyone with any degree of free will would allow their memories and personality to be recorded. It is shown repeatedly that recording your memories lays open all of one's repressed memories and stray thoughts, and implants little copies of oneself in anyone who uploads a taken memory. We are shown a scene where sex memories of a failing actress are retailed to the rubes... what excess baggage do those memories carry? PIN numbers? Locations of hidden valuables?Let's just say that I could go on for a long time on the many problems of the ghosts in the Machine, but I won't bore you.After finishing this book I set it down to let it digest for a couple of days before writing this review in the hopes that if I had some perspective I would feel better about it. Instead I kept thinking about the entire lack of character development, the illogic of the setup, and most of all the falsely happy ending. Like many of the other readers who commented on this book, the redemptive and loving relationship that Barnes finds in the course of the investigation just doesn't make any sense and appears out of nowhere. It just makes no sense that a young, attractive, free-spirited, and intelligent woman would fall hopelessly in love at first sight with the drunken and psychotic wreck that is Barnes. Also I kept recalling the grotesque first hand accounts of death by pickax. Is there a demand for that kind of description? Not by me. I was actively repelled, and I have read some horrific stuff before. And the MO of the PA killer is strange to begin with since there are serious timing issues and relies a lot of the victims behaving in certain ways that cannot be relied upon. But it is only at the end that the full ridiculousness of the killer's motivations are laid open to view to ridicule. Let's just say that I am not sorry that I read the novel, but I won't be reading any more of Holliday's writing. Even if I am intrigued and mystified as to how he will squeeze a book two out of this series."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7940980-alex", "userReview": "Ok.

It did not jump out at me - it just seemed to be the best possibility of a good read. The subject matter is intense and not for the squeamish or those who cannot take violent scenes. The premise is intriguing, if macabre - creation of a machine that can pull recent memories from peoples' minds, including recently deceased, and make the guilty parties (and detectives) relive those last memories. This is definitely at the forefront, as a serial killer is on the loose, and has already broken one detective ...The characters are well written, even though most of them are not fleshed out beyond the main character. This is understandable, as the book us FULL of characters, courtesy of the memory machine. The pacing is very good too. I read this book in one sitting and I did not expect to.Spoilers ----The deceased characters overlapping in several living characters' memories was a new and interesting approach. I enjoyed it. If this is going to be a series, we are going to need better background of the police department and those working in it. The romance felt a bit forced - for most women, a guy that falling apart and self-medicating with alcohol should be setting off warning alarms, not pheromones.

It's definitely a Crime/Detective book, but it's also Sci-fi. I've seen negative reviews about the fact that Holliday didn't go into overly elaborate discussions of the 'science' behind the machine. I'm glad Holliday made that choice because I usually find that stuff is just distracting from the point of the story (e.g. midichlorians). One caveat with this book is that it has quite a bit of gore and violence (murder detective after all), so if that's not something you can take, then this one isn't for you. All in all I really liked it and highly recommend it. It was compelling, making it a fast read even for a tortoise paced reader like myself. I have a pet peeve about how books are ended and I HATE terrible (e.g. rushed) endings or cliffhangers (i.e. no ending) in books, but this one was really well tied-up (something I find unusual in the first of a series) and had a cool twist.

This book is part mystery, part science fiction, or at least I hope it is science fiction, and part horror. All of those parts are well written. Without giving anything away that is not in book's blurb, Barnes' is a detective who, through advanced science, can live out the experiences of his victims in the hopes of catching the perpetrator. I might be haunted by these voices but Barnes is consumed by them and the ghosts from his own past. He wavers on the brink of incapacitation while he struggles to find a killer before he kills again.

Of course, the background twist is that this civilization (today with a twist) includes the machine, a device which can store memories, memories of either the living or the recently living.

But it\u2019s written well in that the reader has no choice but to go along for the dark ride."}, {"userName": "Nikole Fletcher", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38035783-nikole-fletcher", "userReview": "Refreshing & convincingI love the new take on a pliable crime / punishment that is plausible to come to be in the foreseeable future. The whole munky business is great. Characters were developed pretty well, although the character of Jessica, seemed a little contrived, I look forward to what comes next"}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73528723-nicole", "userReview": "This took me longer than expected to get through. It\u2019s an interesting concept and what drew me to it was my background in criminal justice and psychology, since it was a psychological thriller and about how we punish criminals. It really made me think about how we punish criminals, but it also made me wonder about the concept of mind over matter. Barnes wasn\u2019t a very dynamic character or detective there was little character development throughout the entire story. I gave it 3 stars because I saw that there was another book in the series and I have little to no interest in reading the second book."}, {"userName": "Nancy Harmon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8079961-nancy-harmon", "userReview": "Quick and entertaining read, but I felt like the romantic interest happened way too fast. Although I liked the concept of the machine I had trouble figuring out \u201cwhen\u201d this story was supposed to take place. The killer\u2019s motive was rather muddled by the time I reached the end of the book. I only found a couple of typos, like using \u201cset\u201d when it should have been \u201csat\u201d and a couple of other oopses.
