Read the first three full-length novels of this lighthearted series and take off a few bucks at the same time! BOOK 1: WINGING IT! She just wants to fly. Grace skips school to head to Earth for a Mission that seems simple enough, but \"seems\" doesn't make it so. BOOK 2: GROUNDED! Stuck in Heaven Grace's surprise Mission in NYC gets her out of school and back to Earth, but can she resist the temptations of The Big Apple? BOOK 3: BLOWN AWAY! It's about to get wild. Grace is sent to The Wilds to spy on a group of rebel Angels. It'd be a big job for any Angel, tougher still for an Angel in Training.", "title": "Take Off!: Super-sized Confessions of an Angel in Training Box Set Books 1-3 (Confessions of an Angel-in-Training)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28815420-take-off", "average": 5.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1454271041l/28815420.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5253229.Shel_Delisle", "name": "Shel Delisle"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28815420-take-off", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13505602-winging-it", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12973546-dolphin-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18005734-grounded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31182272-the-summer-we-believed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16060817-my-wishful-thinking"]}
