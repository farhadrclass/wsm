The aim was (1) to deploy black artists in order to represent the USA as being racially egalitarian, (2) to overcome the Soviet Union's very successful efforts in deploying classical European music and ballet, (3) to win the hearts and minds of Third Worlders, and (4) to offset the unpopularity of US foreign policy as it moved from a (seeming) ally and champion of newly independent Third World states to world wide hegemony. The stature of musicians sent, the length of their tours, the number of cities they visited, their sheer joy in playing to international audiences -- all this is astonishing even for someone who, like me, is relatively familiar with jazz history. Von Eschen shows that one of the ironies of the Cold War is that it forced the US to send black artists as ambassadors of US freedom and democracy even as those same musicians were mostly unable to access these freedoms at home. These musicians -- Armstrong, Diz, Ellington, Basie, Brubeck, Mingus, Miles, Rollins, Randy Weston, to name a few -- took advantage of this contradiction in two ways: they strengthened their art by accepting government funding and prestige; and, they did not portray a view of the US for which the State Department hoped. Instead, they exposed the problems of racism in the US, created solidarity with local musicians and lay people, and championed a transnational and diasporic legacy of jazz as apposed to a US exceptionalist reading offered by their sponsors.Third World people knew and appreciated these musicians and their music. They were welcomed (except for Benny Goodman) with warmth and wild enthusiasm. However, Von Eschen makes clear that their love of jazz did not stop their trenchant criticism of US imperialism. The book is excellent in its presentation of how the US used art in service of imperialism and how these intentions were subverted into far more positive outcomes by the musicians and their audience."}, {"userName": "Kusaimamekirai", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33921897-kusaimamekirai", "userReview": "\u201cWhat is jazz? If they gotta ask, they ain\u2019t goin to know.\u201d-Louis Armstrong In the mid 1950\u2019s, the Cold War was heating up and independence movements were springing up all over Asia, Europe, and Africa. In the United States, the State Department worried (rightly so) that its image abroad was one of supporting the colonial order both in spirit and in practice. Newly independent countries were turning to Russia for idealogical and technical support as well as hosting Russian cultural exports such as the Bolshoi ballet. In response, the State Department began a program that would exist for almost 40 years in which it sent the most talented musicians of their eras on tours around the developing world.  How these tours originated, their purpose, and how the participating musicians and audiences interpreted them is the story of \u201cSatchmo Blows the World\u201d. As someone who didn\u2019t even know such a program existed I was, excuse the pun, blown away by the information here. Von Eschen persuasively argues that these tours were primarily to counter negative publicity the US was receiving in strategic areas around the world. It is perhaps no coincidence that the Eastern Bloc, and countries in Africa rich in minerals the US was expropriating, were prime targets for these tours. At times, musicians such as Louis Armstrong during his tour of the Belgian Congo in 1961, were present during a US backed military coup.  What makes this book particularly interesting is not simply that these programs existed, but how the musicians reacted to them. Often asked to play to select audiences made up of diplomats or wealthy government officials, musicians like Armstrong demanded that regular people be admitted to his shows as well. The musicians also were adamant about being able to interact with other musicians in a given country whereas the State Department didn\u2019t see any relevance to allowing for it. This would be one of many issues of contention between government and the musicians on tour who clearly saw the role of this program in very different ways. Even the word \u201cjazz\u201d became a bone of contention, with the State Department advertising \u201cjazz shows\u201d and Armstrong taking the stage and saying jazz can be anything, stop calling it jazz.  Ultimately, the musicians while dependent on the government for the opportunity to travel, were extremely independent once they arrived. They were not shy about voicing their opinions and spending time with the people they chose to. In a sense, both the government and the musicians accomplished their goals in that the US was able to present a positive cultural image when it was badly in need of one. Yet one can\u2019t help but feel that the musicians were the real winners here in that their music, rather than leading people toward American style democracy, reinforced their sense of independence and desire to stay that way."}, {"userName": "Jared Gillins", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/274858-jared-gillins", "userReview": "For my history of American popular music class.This, like so many others, is going back into the \"to read\" stack.

From the mid-1950s to the late-1980s, the State Department's Jazz Ambassadors program sent many of the US's greatest jazz musicians on good will tours throughout the world; Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Dave Brubeck, Charles Mingus, Sonny Rollins and many others were dispatched to the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Africa and Southeast Asia as part of a musical hearts-and-minds campaign designed to showcase American culture, generate some positively publicity about American race relations, function as Cold War propaganda, and provide a distraction from some of our more egregious international actions. Von Eschen tells this story, but she's not so much interested in chronicling the Jazz Ambassador program as she is in exploring the many contradictions that the program opened up. Tensions ran rife throughout the history of the program: between the State Dept. and the musicians (who tended to have very different ideas about how well American race relations were going, as well as about who the ideal audience for jazz was); between State and Congress (the program was continually attacked by conservative congressman, some of whom saw all arts funding as a waste of money and others of whom saw a popular art form with its origins in black culture as unworthy of representing America abroad); and between the musicians themselves (particularly between old-school and new-school jazzmen). Von Eschen uses these tensions to explore questions of culture, race, and democracy at mid-century, all while telling a great story full of fascinating characters (my favorite being King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, a jazz lover and accomplished sax and clarinet player who held all-night jam sessions with Benny Goodman). Von Eschen ultimately concludes that the Jazz Ambassador program was a success, though not in the ways the government had hoped it would be, because it allowed musicians to connect directly with their counterparts and ordinary people throughout the world (and not so much through governments as beyond governments). In the end, the Jazz Ambassadors may have practiced a headier version of democracy that the U.S. was willing to preach; it\u2019s a story worth knowing and remembering, and it is well-told here."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2618129-emily", "userReview": "Against the backdrop of the Cold War, the US civil rights movement, and the emergence of 40 new African and Asian countries recently freed from colonialism, the US State Department sent African American jazz musicians, like Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and David Brubeck as American goodwill ambassadors \u201cinto countries where communism had a foothold\u201d (7). Through these tours, the State Department sought to shape the world in an American liberal image, as well as to revitalize and secure the idea of America abroad, by promoting \u201ca vision of color-blind democracy\u201d (4) and a uniquely American modernist art form \u2013 jazz. From their inception in the mid-1950s, the state sanctioned jazz tours were for the most part extremely popular in locales as far afield as Eastern Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The color-blind and America-born mythologies that fueled the tour broke down, however, as performers voiced their own views on racial politics and established relationships with jazz enthusiasts the world over. In 1978, the curtain closed on State Department sponsorship of international jazz tours, ending a more than thirty-year period of transnational artistic diplomacy, exchange, and rebellion. Penny Von Eschen concludes, \u201c[P]art of the reason the era ended lies in the very character of jazz itself. An art form born of transnational upheaval and grounded in innovation and improvisation could not be contained by one nation\u201d (249)."}, {"userName": "Dolgun", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8682769-dolgun", "userReview": "I found it weird though that there was no introduction for the book. it might be hard for most readers to start a book whithout knowing the writers intenstions and goals from presenting his/her work.The book gives detailed description of the jazz tours sponsored by the American government starting 1956. Implementing the contradictions of this government concerning the situation of African Americans situation and how these situations are different domestically and internationally. However Von Eschen explains that these jazz tours demonstrates how the ambassadors often challenged and argued with the US government. One of things I liked too and wished to read more about it is the relations that were established between the African American artists and the international musicians.

I really thought that they were traveling independently. I had no idea that they were doing it as part of the US government's agenda.I also travelled as a musical ambassador , for a couple of years, under the sponsorship of the American Embassy and I only got to read this book some 5 years after I had stopped doing it. It was quite interesting to get a better understanding of where we were sent, when we were sent, and why we were sent there.

This book seamlessly blends Cold War history from both an American and an international point of view.The best part of the book, though, was discussing it with 30 other history teachers and 1 fabulous UNR professor. The discussion ranged from racism at home and abroad, how the world views Americans versus American foreign policy and the pros/cons of \"cultural history.\"But, for the non-history teacher book clubbers of the world, this is still a marvelous twist on Cold War history."}, {"userName": "Michelle Brewer-Bunnell", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36222668-michelle-brewer-bunnell", "userReview": "Serving as both a historical and a cultural backdrop for the Cold War, this book brings a sort of eye-opening understanding for some of the greatest jazz musicians to ever bebop the world.

From 1956 through the late 1970s, America dispatched its finest jazz musicians to the far corners of the earth, from Iraq to India, from the Congo to the Soviet Union, in order to win the hearts and minds of the Third World and to counter perceptions of American racism.Penny Von Eschen escorts us across the globe, backstage and onstage, as Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and other jazz luminaries spread their music and their ideas further than the State Department anticipated. Both in concert and after hours, through political statements and romantic liaisons, these musicians broke through the government's official narrative and gave their audiences an unprecedented vision of the black American experience. In the process, new collaborations developed between Americans and the formerly colonized peoples of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East--collaborations that fostered greater racial pride and solidarity.Though intended as a color-blind promotion of democracy, this unique Cold War strategy unintentionally demonstrated the essential role of African Americans in U.S. national culture. Through the tales of these tours, Von Eschen captures the fascinating interplay between the efforts of the State Department and the progressive agendas of the artists themselves, as all struggled to redefine a more inclusive and integrated American nation on the world stage.", "title": "Satchmo Blows Up the World: Jazz Ambassadors Play the Cold War", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/147819.Satchmo_Blows_Up_the_World", "average": 3.69, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347756546l/147819.jpg", "reviews": 18, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/85527.Penny_M_Von_Eschen", "name": "Penny M.
