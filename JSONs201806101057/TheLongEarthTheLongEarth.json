I love Sir Terry. I love the books & have great respect for the man. This review is simply my opinion of the success of this particular collaboration. I'll be 1st in line for the next T.P book and I'd even give T.P + S.B another go. From the slew of 4 & 5* reviews already on show I may be out on a limb on this one - so don't listen to me - give it a try.-------------Collaboration. It\u2019s a word with an unfortunate aftertaste. Collaborators get a bad rap. Sir Terry Pratchett\u2019s collaborations with other notable authors have been limited. In 1990 we saw Good Omens, produced with Neil Gaiman. On the crest of that success Pratchett found another partner in Larry Niven but this effort floundered with Niven producing Rainbow Mars in 1999 as a solo work built upon some of their shared ideas. And now 2012 sees The Long Earth, a collaboration with Stephen Baxter. The accompanying promotion contains a photo of the two grandees locked in combat before a laden bookshelf. A certain degree of dynamic tension does help in collaborative writing, too little and you get compromise writing, too much and it\u2019s never going to get finished. I think here both men were pulling punches and the pages could have benefited from a good blooding!\tCollaborations can be port and stilton good, or marmite and custard bad. I suspect it\u2019s impossible for two fine writers like Baxter and Pratchett to serve up anything wholly unpalatable, but the Long Earth feels long, although it is short, and is decidedly blah. Think porridge.\tThe Long Earth is science fiction. In science fiction the IDEA tends to overshadow the characters and even the story. Here the IDEA has flattened both. Glimpses of story and character may be seen poking out from the margins of the IDEA, vital juices pooling. You can\u2019t see much but you can see enough to know you don\u2019t need an ambulance.\tThe Terry Pratchett of Discworld fame has not shown up to this party. There\u2019s rarely a smile in The Long Earth, and never a laugh. The idea explored is that Earth sits in one of an infinity of parallel universes and that these become opened up to humanity such that pretty much everyone can step through them like moving from one card to the next in a deck of cards. We get to hear a lot about the impact this has on humanity, both social and economic. Sometimes we hear this from characters who pop up and are not heard of again, giving the book a disjointed feel. Of the hundreds of thousands of Earths open to Joe Public almost all are Earth as it would have been without us. A lot of time is spent detailing minor evolutionary variations in the flora and fauna, to the point where you just don\u2019t care about one more slightly smaller elephant or slightly uglier crocodile. A lot of time is spent hopping from one forest world to the next. It\u2019s an idea that is interesting in a paragraph but becomes increasingly dull over 300 pages.\tThe writing, line by line, is fine. It lacks trade-mark Pratchett sharpness but it does the job. The story arching over chapters is . . . not gripping. There\u2019s essentially no tension in it. Our heroes (a young man who is very good at moving through the worlds, and an artificial intelligence named Lobsang) are exploring, they don\u2019t have any clear goals stated, nothing is after them, they have no serious problems, they don\u2019t appear worried or even to care that much, and thus as a reader one tends to a similar disposition.\tThe book ends with a bang, but it\u2019s a rather ineffectual one that is, like the bulk of the book, hard to care about. I\u2019m a fan of Sir Terry\u2019s work and I applaud his willingness to experiment with new styles and new writing partners. I hope he keeps doing it. I cannot though, hand on heart say I enjoyed this book. Not even a little.\t Edit: RIP Sir Terry - you left us many great books to remember you by.Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes..."}, {"userName": "Bookdragon Sean ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-bookdragon-sean", "userReview": "Science fiction is full of stories that go backwards and forwards; they swing through the spectrum of time and explore the popular trope in all its possibilities. Pratchett and Baxter, on the other hand, step sideways.The Long Earth is a seemingly endless series of alternate realities with Earth being the focal point. By using a Stepper, a piece of technology that is powered by a potato (Pratchett at work no doubt), the user can travel along the spectrum of Earths and step foot on thousands of different versions of their home world. Needless to say, the scope of such a thing is huge and the possibilities extraordinary. Anything could be out there on one of these Earths. Just imagine an Earth new and fresh, green and full of life, one that hasn\u2019t yet been harvested by man. Sounds beautiful. \"All these parallel Earths are identical on all but the detailed level. Oh, save that they are empty. Well, actually they are full, mainly of forest and swamp. Big, dark, silent forests, deep, clinging, lethal swamps. But empty of people. The Earth is crowded, but the Long Earth is empty.\" Did this book just reveal my inner misanthropy? The idea completely sold the story to me. The protagonist, Joshua, a boy who can step without the technology, is rather ordinary. He is hired by a crazy scientist called Labsong who wants protection on an exploration mission. Together they travel to the ends of the The Long Earth to see exactly how far it stretches and to see if it is, indeed, infinite as many scientists theorise. The two men are unassuming and very uninteresting in the beginning. They are not what keep the story going. However, by the end it is very clear that their part in the events will be very vital and their chemistry does develop. Instead what drove the story forward was wonder, curiosity and, again, possibility. The Idea behind The Long Earth is vastly imaginative and finding exactly what made it work kept me reading. I was in awe at some of the descriptions of the places that the characters found themselves. The descriptions on the first page (that of the image on the cover) were particularly great. I also found the reasons given for natural phenomena and mythological creatures on the real Earth very clever and quite funny. It\u2019s certainly a well thought out book. It evoked a sense of wonder as the two men delved into the unknown, I, too, wanted to know what was at the very ends of it all. As far as the authorship goes, the two writers couldn\u2019t be further apart. This collaboration shouldn\u2019t work; yet, somehow, it does. Pratchett is clearly the idea man, his wisdom and subtle humour is tamed by Baxter\u2019s scientific knowledge. The wiring is informative, though Pratchett\u2019s influence frees Baxter\u2019s mechanical and dry prose from its mundanity. It is snappy in places, explanatory and even has a few laugh out loud moments. Many of the criticisms for this book centres on its characters and lack of plot drive. For some readers this was a book that didn\u2019t go anywhere, though for me it was a book that went everywhere. I\u2019m not sure how the rest of the series will compare, but I do think this instalment is rather excellent: this series has so much potential. I hope it doesn\u2019t limit itself."}, {"userName": "Carmen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen", "userReview": "[ anger and subsequent terrorist acts as a result of his family's abandonment.

Turns out I liked parts of it. The idea of millions of Earths branching out from ours--a variation on different choices creating different realities--is pretty cool, as is the mechanism by which people reach them. Pratchett and Baxter gave a lot of thought to how the Earth might have developed differently under different circumstances, such as the lack of a moon altering tides and climate or even failing to deflect large asteroids from the planet. I also liked the vignettes interspersed with the main plot, about how the discovery of Stepping affected ordinary people. The characters were charming and the aliens were interesting, if not particularly original.Unfortunately, what should have been the high point of the story fell flat. The mystery of who or what they're going to find at the far end of the Long Earth grows increasingly suspenseful--and then the answer is...sort of blah. The reason for the disaster that's driving the aliens inward toward our Earth, the origin Earth, is in fact disastrous, but doesn't feel disastrous--and it's dispensed with too easily, no sacrifice (literally none, as the last sentence of the book proves) and no payoff.I was more dissatified with the social ramifications the authors believed would arise from this situation:1. Supposedly, Stepping off to new and untamed wildernesses means the economy of Datum Earth (the main world) would start to collapse. That's sort of true in the sense that if you remove enough of any vital material from an economy, it will destabilize. But the historical example of the depopulation that happened because of the Plague in the 14th century says that not only will the economy restabilize, it can do so in a way that improves the lives of the survivors. Since it's impossible to bring anything made of iron into the other Earths, the people who stay behind get to keep all the resources of civilization. And since the authors also argue that violence and crime are almost entirely caused by overpopulation, wouldn't that mean that Datum Earth would see a similar drop in crime when the poverty-stricken rise out of poverty?2. Except I don't actually buy the whole \"crime is caused by competition for resources\" thing. People kill for a lot of reasons that don't have anything to do with theft, and even if you look at one person killing another to take the second person's mate as competition for resources, it only takes three people for that to happen. The utopian settlements of the Long Earth come off, to me, as more of a social statement than a realistic possibility--a given outcome, based on assumptions that they didn't try to prove.Overall, it was enjoyable once, but not a book I'd want to read again."}, {"userName": "Apatt", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt", "userReview": "\u201cIt is hard for scientists even to talk about the Long Earth without babbling about m-brane manifolds and quantum multiverses.\u201dIt would be hard for Stephen Baxter to resist waxing lyrical about quantum whatsits I suppose. I read his Xeelee omnibus and only understood half of the science expositions (and that is an optimistic estimate). However, with The Long Earth Baxter has the late great Terry Pratchett to help make the science part more palatable and also infuse the novel with the magic of his wit, characterization, and of course, humour. I have not read the Baxter & Clarke collaborations yet (coming soon), but they seem to be very like-minded gentlemen, and while I look forward to reading some mind blowing super science from their books I think the pairing with Pratchett seems like a much more dynamic combination; two very different talents that beautifully complement each other.The Long Earth is basically about parallel worlds, more specifically parallel Earths. This is hardly a new sci-fi conceit but this book\u2014first in a series of five\u2014 explores more of the possibilities, ramifications, and science than other parallel universe books I have read. In The Long Earth, a scientist invents a simple device that enables the user to step into a parallel Earth, in the dimension adjacent to ours, also the next adjacent one, on and on presumably infinitely. \u201cEarths, untold Earths. More Earths than could be counted, some said. And all you had to do was walk sideways into them, one after the next, an unending chain.\u201dThe Stepper schematic (powered by a potato!)The design and circuitry of the \u201cStepper\u201d device are shared on the internet and immediately becomes a worldwide sensation. As millions of people migrate to an alternate Earth, there is suddenly plenty of room and resources for everyone. This puts an end to scarcity, overpopulation and even poverty. The narrative is mostly focused on the adventures of Joshua Valient\u00e9 and an AI entity called Lobsang across \u201cthe Long Earth\u201d (the term for all the parallel Earths). They are later joined by a woman called Sally Linsay. Joshua and Sally are \u201cnatural steppers\u201d who can travel without a Stepper device, as for Lobsang, there is very little he can not do. Beside this major story arc, the narrative occasionally switches to a young girl called Helen Green who has migrated to an alternate Earth to set up a colony with her family. There is also a small plot strand about a policewoman called Monica Jansson who is keeping an eye on malcontents who are unable to travel to a parallel Earth due to some innate disability. All the story threads are good, but the main story arc with Joshua and Lobsang is the most epic, as they travel further from \u201cDatum Earth\u201d (our Earth) than anyone else and discover all kinds of strange life forms and discover a danger that threatens every single iteration of Earth. I remember when The Long Earth came out in 2012 there were many readers who expressed their disappointment with the book. That is why I am reading it now five years later. I have to say this book is a blast, very enjoyable and imaginative. I suspect many of the people who are disappointed with it are die-hard Discworld fans. The Long Earth is very different in tone from a typical Discworld book in that humour is not placed at the front and center of the narrative, it is not even a major component. The emphasis is here is on adventures, colonization, pioneering and exploration; basically The Long Earth is a romp. The wit and charm of Terry Pratchett\u2019s prose and characterization are there in abundance, coupled with Stephen Baxter\u2019s hard sci-fi inventiveness. I have speculated that some Terry Pratchett\u2019s fans may be disappointed by the emphasis on adventures rather than humour, but what about Stephen Baxter\u2019s fans? Well, there is less emphasis on science also, much less than you would find in a solo Baxter book. This is conceivably disappointing for hardcore hard sci-fi fans who probably enjoy Baxter\u2019s normal detailed quantum physics expositions. However, for me, there is just the right amount of science to make the story plausible and fascinating. This collaboration is a synergistic success and I think Baxter is very lucky to have the opportunity to work with Pratchett for five books, and I think sci-fi fans are lucky that these two excellent gentlemen decided to combine forces. I am looking forward to reading the rest of this series.

While most people need these devices, there are some natural steppers who don't need them, and also some that can't step at all, having to be \"carried\" over by others.Fast forward a few years. Natural stepper Joshua Valiente, along with Lobsang the super computer, decide to test the limits of these parallel worlds and go on the journey of their... ugh... lives (?). In the meantime, the rest of humanity decides it's time to start over, and begin colonizing the newly discovered worlds... or at least that's the plan. Nature however, seems to have a few choice words about that. Oh and there's also the humans left behind due to their inability to step, who don't seem to be up to any good... I frequently pick up novels authored by Terry Pratchett, and then often find myself utterly underwhelmed by it all. I loved Thief of Time as well as (most of) the books featuring the witches. It's actually the author's particular brand of humor, that makes me come back to his novels over and over again.So imagine my surprise when I hardly found any of that humor in this book, and yet I still ended up liking it a lot. As a matter of fact, if it weren't for the name Lobsang, I wouldn't have even recognized my favorite author's style.I liked the whole science behind the concept of a \"Long Earth\". You can clearly see that someone put a whole lot of thought into it, and didn't just stop at the first random thought. For some reason, the story reminds me of 2001 A Space Odyssey: there's something about the atmosphere that made me want to continue.Score: 4/5 starsIt's best to read this book without expecting to see the author's (well Terry Pratchett's at any rate) fingerprint at every corner. I don't mean that in a bad way, quite the contrary, but for those of you expecting to see here the entertaining aspect from the Discworld novels... you'll be heavily disappointed.

A device allowing easy jumping to countless alternate worlds (conveniently free of human populations) is invented. Many people embrace this passionately, and rush off to stake their claim in a 'land rush' with no visible end game. A small percentage can't go and others don't want to, but the effect of this mass dispersal is economies collapsing, new religions, fighting among old religions. It's a book about global change.The book doesn't focus on a single person, showing us the experiences of a half-dozen or so, and headhops through a bunch more, but the primary character is Joshua, one of the first to hop, and also a natural hopper, able to travel without the device. He's an orphan, and inclined to be a major loner, and in part his progression involves finding someone he might want to travel with.The book didn't work for me in a number of different ways.The prose scales the pinnacles of beige. The plot is leaden and there's little sense of wonder, of individuals overcoming adversity, or awe or delight. But the biggest problem is Joshua, who is Super Special and Innately Superior to Everyone, so much more in connection with the natural world, so superior in his reactions to the other worlds, so much better a logical thinker, so better able to cope. People keep telling him that, so we can be sure it's not just his opinion. He is full of a combination of disdain and dislike for almost everyone he encounters, and is also a Famous Hero. When the (strangely enormous number of) children in his neighbourhood who simultaneously decided they wanted to follow some guy on the internet's suggestion they figure out how to solder some wires into a circuit and jab them into a potato, he told them that, hey, maybe you should try turning the switch the Other Direction.

Kids throughout the world make a copy and end up travelling into a parallel world. It seems that there are multiple Earth's all lined up and you can either travel in one direction or another, named East or West to a parallel Earth. Hasn't this been done before? Yes. Has it been done like this? My argument is no.Anyone who knows my taste in books knows that I appreciate the info-dump. I appreciate a great amount of detail as long as it is fascinating. And that is what you get here. I also appreciate thought experiments that explore the implications of scenarios to the best of their ability. I have hot it recently with Locke and Key and The Fifteen Lives of Henry August. This novel explores the implications of these parallel Earth's and throws in some great ideas. There is not too much of a plot at all, and I see this reflected in the bad reviews on here. This is a book that explores ideas rather than human relationships.I'm going to probably get some gasps at this statement: I don't really enjoy Terry Pratchett's humour. I've read a handful of Discworld novels and they are slightly entertaining, but I liken them to candy floss. Sweet, but forgettable. No sustenance. and the humour can be laid on a bit thick. Yes, Sir Terry I understood you are trying to be witty and intelligent. I was prepared for a bit of that here, but it is very toned down. There is some zaniness in parts, but it is all explained within the system, it never feels zany for the sake of zany.So a 4 star read for me, and probably any other nerd who loves info-dumps and big ideas.

The moral to this kind of story is always that this is a ridiculously ignorant concept--ideas are easy, it's execution that's hard.This is a novel in which two extremely prolific authors forgot this. Well, to be honest, calling this a \"novel\" strikes me as generous. There are some people in it; I've seen ten page short stories that featured more memorable characters with better developed arcs. Some things happen, but they're not really so much a plot as just some events, with some slightly bigger events kinda near the end that don't actually resolve anything. There are settings--oh, so many settings. But while each one has the potential to be a thought experiment, in actuality, each one receives a brief description and no development. Most role-playing supplements do a better job of creating intriguing worlds. More than anything else, this feels like a novel-length list of ideas for a forty book series, each of which could be developed into a story but hasn't been yet. The book concludes with a note that the story begins in Madison, WI, because the authors were there for a con and so could do research. I would have guessed that they looked at Google Maps for five minutes, for all the individuality the Madison setting displays. Umm, there's a government building. And some cafes. And I think there was a lake or something. This is a terrible thing to say, but I'm kind of hoping that Pratchett only agreed to this because he was worried about having enough money for his medical care and was hoping he could get a couple bucks more for his heirs out of this. I have more to rant about, in far more specificity--from the incredible lameness of the ending to the number of issues raised and then never resolved to various gaping plot holes to the sheer number of potentially interesting ideas that are somehow presented in a way that make them completely uninteresting and then dropped. Because honestly, this book pissed me off in its incredible waste of potential. But you know what? It's not actually worth anyone's time. Mine to write them, or yours to read them.

What would people do? Would there be a mass exodus? Would people try to exploit this travel for their own gain or exploiting others? How would it affect the economy of Earth and the people who remained? What would remain valuable and what wouldn't? Would governments remain intact? So many questions and fascinating to think about.Unfortunately, the storyline that is the vehicle for this premise is not quite as strong.

I didn't quite really like it, but I didn't just like it. I went with four because it is my default when I read such a book and it makes me think.The idea behind this book will be slightly familiar to those who watched Sliders or who have read comic books. The twist is that most people can step to the words either by natural talent or with a device that is readily availble. There is a small minority of humanity that can't do this.The thing is, unlike Sliders or comic book, Baxter and Pratchett really look at what this would mean to politics, family, and economy. This is the best writing of the book (and give rise to the shot at the French). It is this ascept that really gets your to think. The down side is that there is another plot involing Joshua and his employer (who really is from Discworld) who are travelling the multiple earths. In some ways, this feels like a quest in search of a plot. And while it allows for wonderful Geekdom references that any Sci-Fi fan will love, I actually wanted to follow the minor characters more because they were most intersting.Though I loved the cat digression.The book jacket hints that this will be the first in the series (the ending is slightly cliffhangerish. It can go either way). If that is true, this book than seems more of a door opening world building to allow the two gentleman too play more (which would be great).The writing styles do seem to merge, there are flashes of Pratchett wit, though no footnotes - but this is a collarbortion not a straight Pratchett.

A strange blend of young adult and science fiction written for the novice and almost as many pop culture references as Ernest Cline. If I'd only been informed in advance to expect a young adult novel I would have been less annoyed, Pratchett has written some of the very best YA there is, but as it stands this is apparently a book for adults. Stephen Baxter has written some of the most complex science fiction I've ever picked up let alone read and to witness such feats of imagination and imagination stirring ideas watered down in to the fluff contained within these pages was incredibly disappointing. The constant referring to films and the references to the blogging and wikipedia and dead tree technology etc. also felt completely arbitrary, the kind of thing that will immediately date this book unlike the work Asimov and Heinlein et al that The Long Earth is seemingly trying to emulate. Don't get me started on the absurdity of two great English storytellers choosing to set their story in America which can only be seen as a crass attempt to shift units in my opinion. But still, these complaints aside, this is a decent piece of science fiction writing by two natural born storytellers, it isn't bad it is just a disappointment. If I hadn't discovered science fiction before this I just might have become a convert overnight thanks to the imagination firing that takes places during Joshua's quest. My frustration extends to the denouement which after 400+ pages felt more than a bit rushed and anticlimactic followed by a tacked on set up for a sequel.

Some of these alternate earths are little different, but others are almost empty of people. It was a lot of fun to experience the discovery process of the pioneering participants and equally so the emerging response of governments and society, faced with the disappearance of a generation of youth, to begin extend their reach across adjacent universes/worlds. Venues for emigrants to try a better way of living, but still need policing from criminals and tyrants among them. Worlds ripe for exploitation of known resources and, if possible, taxing. Our main character is a loner boy, Josh, who can step worlds without a device and goes further afield along the dimension of alternative worlds. A female police office, Monica, makes for an empathetic supporting character who aims to keep people safe, foil serious criminals in nearby parallel worlds, and find some kind of solution for those who are left behind due to disability or poor reactions to stepping. Years after the breakout from one earth, Josh is sought out by a quirky genius AI named Lobsang, who is imbued with a colorful and often comic personality extracted from a real person, a Tibetan motorcycle repairman. With funding from a global tech corporation and a vacuum-tight luxurious airship , they set out to explore the far reaches of thousands or millions of alternate worlds down the path from their own. Along the way, they discover worlds with altered evolution and essential alien versions of both sentient primates and of predator species, many of which have evolved conscious stepping like Josh. They also gain the alliance of one Sally, who becomes a kindred spirit in their pursuit of answers to many mysteries of the multiverse as well as a potential love interest for Josh. Eventually, their pursuit of patterns leads them to the hypothesis of some large threat down the worldline that is leading many races and species to travel a direction opposite to their trajectory. The book did a fair job leaving this aspect hanging for the sequels in the series while achieving some closure on major plot elements. From the titles of the four successor volumes, one can gather that extensions of multiverse travel will take us through a big war, colonization of mars, exploration of utopias, and something with a cosmic dimension for the last. I am satisfied with stopping for now with this volume under my belt, as I feel the innovative aspects of the scenario must surely reach a peak in the first novel of the set. The teamwork between Baxter, a writer of hard science fiction with weird aliens and odd physics or time travel, and Pratchett, most known for his playful Discworld fantasy series (I\u2019ve read three of each), was satisfying to experience. Apatt is apt in his lovely review on Goodreads in his projections on which parts of the novel derive from which author in the collaboration. To me, the pleasurable sense of adventure and discovery of wonders in the tale reminds me of comparable stories with oddball teams exploring new worlds and possibilities. Examples include Farmer\u2019s \u201cRiverworld\u201d, where all humans who ever lived awake on the shore of a seemingly infinite river; Niven and Pournelle\u2019s \u201cRingworld\u201d, where a team of humans and aliens explore a world constructed a ring around a sun; and Varley\u2019s \u201cTitan\u201d, in which a space crew is trapped inside a world-size craft with a zoo of other alien captives. The concept of travel through the multiverse is a great innovation itself to the limited literature that struggles to make human sense of a theory that first took a serious stage among scientists in the 60s. Yes, there is a growing collection of alternative history novels, but there are relatively few books that help us in our current horizon to take account of the likelihood of many parallel universes, possible spinning out infinitely from alternative paths of the present. Stephenson\u2019s novel \u201cAnathem\u201d stands out a pretty lonely in that regard. Books like Atkinson\u2019s \u201cLife After Life\u201d hold up a vision of being able to replay one\u2019s life choices to take alternate tracks in history, while Crouch\u2019s \u201cDark Matter\u201d has the innovation of a door between alternate worlds with different personal histories. I guess I am not surprised as it took decades for quantum physics to be meaningfully accommodated into sci fi beyond adaptation of wormholes to travel."}, {"userName": "Roo", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6748541-roo", "userReview": "The idea and main concept of this book is immensly intriguing, and while certainly not a unique concept in the sci fi genre, the potential for a 'Terry Pratchett' take on it, appealed to me.As I read this book, an overwhelming surge of familiarity swept over me. It felt like I was treading very similiar waters, dealing with characters, ideas, motifs, themes that I knew, but couldn't quite put my finger on 'why'? it felt so familiar. Exploring the vastness of uncharted worlds, finding almost humanoid, maybe sinister, maybe just different species, an corporation with a long reach, an overly clever AI... it felt so much 'I've read this before, I've seen this before,'. And alas, did not present an interesting enough 'spin' on those familiar ideas. There are no 'original' stories, certainly. There are however original and engaging versions/interpretations. Alas, in my opinion, The Long Earth is not such an interpretation.Leaving the familiarity aside for a moment, by the time I reached a substantial mid point in the book, I still did not feel connected to the main characters. I was reading still for curiousity's sake, just to see how it all turned out, rather than due to a vested interest in the characters' development and motives. The narrative informed me that the characters were 'changing, learning' just in case I had missed it - and I fear that I had. I enjoyed and appreciated the split story telling, the slow reveal of how the various secondary plots intersected with the main story, but the pace felt ponderous, the reveals almost 'by the way' rather than dramatic. The ending felt unfinished and rushed, and obviously tapering off for a sequel (as hinted at on the cover). Nonetheless, it still felt - unrealised. Here however, is my main disappointment with the book. The initial idea of a 'Long Earth' excited me. It is something (from a sci fi perspective) I would love to explore. Multiple Earths (with or without humanity) to explore, to see my own country as it would be without humanity's marks. The story touched on the excitement and peace, the escape offered to humanity but this sense of joy, of exploration was undermined by the certainity that humanity would screw it up. Not the fear that we would, just the certainity that we would. However realistic or just pessismistic that view is, I felt that even the brief spots of potenital hope were undermined as well - Happy Landings, Reboot - all tainted by an underlying worry or fear. I did not walk away from this book with a glimmer of hope for humanity. For me, this so often is what sci fi embodies - the vision, the dream of transcending our current issues, of taking the opportunity to learn, to leave our childish ways behind - to succeed. The Long Earth gives humanity endless options, yet the narrative undermined that very hope. And I feel missed the joy, the excitement of exploration. (Or the mindless terror)On the whole, I wanted to enjoy this book. I cannot say that I did. I finished it and felt depressed rather than hopeful. Books can make you think, challenge our views and expectations. Sci Fi especially can do - pose a challenge to look beyond the humdrum of our existence to the potential, the hope for our future. I was not expecting the usual Pratchett humour, although it would have been nice. It could only have improved a story that otherwise struggled to engage me, and left me not only wanting more - but wishing it had been better.I realise this review is somewhat morose and depressed, but that is, alas, how I feel about this book - or rather how it left me feeling. Perhaps that was the intention, to end on a moment of despair, fear - and future books will resolve that - offer the hope I missed. One can hope :)"}, {"userName": "Barry Cunningham", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64969574-barry-cunningham", "userReview": "A fabulous book with fabulous concepts.

I was thrilled by the characters and felt the wonderful sense of adventure and then suspense as things got dire. And that's just it. We get the best of both worlds, the hard-SF premise that promises to throw us into a very, very large setting because we're traveling through hundreds of thousands of alternate Earths as people \"step\" through them, getting the implications explored, from economics to law to nationhood and all the way back to what it means to be an individual.But what's more, it's a rip-roaring fun ride, with the classic iconoclastic loner with a unique ability to travel quickly between worlds and a truly fantastic Coke machine that thinks he's a human, (Really, he's a Buddhist AI airship, but who's counting?)And through all this, my expectations for a fun story, great characters, heavy science (explained easily or even just glossed over for the sake of speed, while also remaining accurate), and world building and plain imagination is all thrown into the same bag.

Interspersed with the tale of exploration are snippets looking at the social and economic impacts of the fact that there's now a nearly infinite amount of land available for humans to populate -- and what it means when some people just pick up and leave their world behind in search of a better one.Like any story that Terry Pratchett has been involved in writing, The Long Earth has a touch of humor to it, but it also poses some interesting philosophical questions and feels at times more like a Heinlein or Asimov novel than a Discworld story -- which makes sense, because it's *not* a Discworld story. If that's what you're expecting, you'll probably be disappointed.You'll also probably be disappointed if you like your stories wrapped up in a bow with everything explained at the end. There are a lot of questions asked in this story that are never answered -- and while it's possible that's just to leave open room for a sequel, I kind of like the open-ended nature of the world(s) and characters created in this story and don't see the need for a second volume.There are times when the story seems to ramble a bit, and some of the characters we're introduced to only seem to play a role for a moment or two and then fade into the background, leaving me wondering if they even added enough color to the story to merit the few seconds it takes to read about them.

The story centers on Joshua, one of the few people who can step spontaneously. Most other people need a relatively simple device to aid in their stepping. One can step \"east\" or \"west\", and proceed over and over again, stepping into parallel universes.The Earth in each universe has a geology that has developed differently, and life has evolved into different forms. Some Earths are very similar to our own, while others are very different. The best aspect of this book, is the uniqueness of this stepping idea, and how the authors develop the features of each Earth.There is an unknown pressure that is driving sapient creatures back toward our own Earth; this is the central mystery in the book. Nevertheless, there is hardly any conflict in this book--there is a little bit, but it doesn't occupy a central place. Most of the book is occupied with the interplay between Joshua and an organic/mechanistic hybrid person. Does this person have a \"human\" mind, or is it some sort of artificial intelligence? Sometimes, the hybrid person has to pass a \"Turing test\".There isn't much of a plot. It is an adventure story, but without conflict or major obstacles. A \"feel-good\" atmosphere envelops much of the story, sort of reminiscent of Heinlein. However, in this book it seems rather banal. A lot of science fiction books, though futuristic, are believable to some extent. This story, unfortunately, lacks even a shred of believability.I didn't read this book--I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Michael Fenton-Stevens. He is an excellent reader, and varies the characters' accents to make them quite distinctive. This undoubtedly raised the enjoyment factor for this book, that would otherwise have been a bit dull."}, {"userName": "Bob Milne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2224905-bob-milne", "userReview": "The Long Earth is a concept Terry Pratchett first developed back in the mid-80s, around the same time that he was finishing up the third Discworld book, Equal Rights. The novel was a victim of Pratchett's own success, getting left behind when the Discworld series proved to be so successful. Sadly, as much as I wanted to like it, and as promising as the first few chapters were, it really does feel like a book that was written 25 years ago, handed off to somebody else, and then rushed into print. Nothing against Stephen Baxter, who is an amazing author on his own, but this is an awkward collaboration that really adds nothing to my Pratchett shelves.The concept here is definitely intriguing, even if it's not quite fully explained. Basically, humanity has discovered the ability to 'step' between parallel worlds. There are those among us who have always been able to do so naturally, without really understanding what they've done or how, but one man's eccentric experiments have bestowed that ability upon anybody willing to construct one of his little 'stepping' boxes. Suddenly, humanity has access to an infinite number of pristine worlds, as ripe for exploitation as they are for exploration.There are some interesting catches, of course - stepping makes most people violently ill, nothing made of iron can move between worlds, and stepping from atop a skyscraper to a world without buildings is a really bad idea - but the possibilities are endless. What makes the first half of the book so interesting is the unexpected consequences of stepping. Criminals suddenly have easy access to even the most impenetrable places on Earth, forcing governments and banks literally underground. Greedy explorers invest everything they own to replicate the gold rush on other worlds, only to find that everybody else had the same idea, and that gold has been rendered worthless. Immigration is pretty much a thing of the past (why apply for visas and passports when you can just 'step' somewhere new), and governments are left scrambling to keep the infrastructure and economy running smoothly with half the population suddenly gone.Those side-tales, however, are also part of what's wrong with the book later on. Pratchett and Baxter spend far too much time relating stories of the new explorers when, in the grand scheme of things, they really add very little to the story. Similarly, as interesting as it is to reexamine some urban legends by imagining the participants were natural steppers, they go back to the well far too often, and the stories that were so entertaining early on just become annoyances later. Unfortunately, it turns out these asides are necessary to keep things moving, since the central storyline just isn't strong enough or interesting enough to carry a whole novel.As for that storyline, we have a natural stepper who has become something of a reluctant celebrity because of his heroic actions the night the rest of the world learned to step. We also have a sentient computer who believes himself to be the reincarnation of a dead human, and a shadowy organization who employs them both. The two set out on a mission to explore their way to the heart of the Long Earth (assuming there is such a thing), stepping across hundreds of thousands of worlds on their journey. If you've ever watched a child flick through the channels on TV, stop every once in a while to watch a few minutes of a show, and then keep flicking again, you've basically shared the experience of the book. They do have some adventures, and do discover some interesting facts about how we're not alone in these parallel worlds, but there's far too much filler between the facts.In the end, this felt very much like a young-adult novel that wants to be more, the kickoff to a series that really seems to have no clear direction ahead. It comes across as somewhat lazy and haphazard, with flashes of brilliance, but an overall dullness that left me skimming chapters by the end. Not even a surprising act of anti-stepper terrorism at the end can rescue the overall story.While I didn't expect a Discworld level farce, Pratchett's trademark absurd humour is largely missing here, aside from a few quirky (but unusually subtle) bits. It's a shame, because that might have helped to carry the story. The Discworld novels are not exactly the most amazingly plotted works of epic fantasy ever to grace the shelves, but they are fun reads that understand how to continuously engage the reader. That engagement, more than anything else, is what is missing here, leaving us with a story that doesn't live up to the concept, and characters who are too one-dimensional to carry one Earth, much less hundreds of thousands.Originally reviewed at Beauty in Ruins"}, {"userName": "Kenchiin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41280039-kenchiin", "userReview": "The Long Earth is a clear example of a great idea that's been poorly executed.They are both great writers, but the plot goes nowhere and many pages later you're wondering why were you reading this in the first place."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613919-jason", "userReview": "4 StarsThis is a case where I actually would give it full marks because it is right up my alley.
