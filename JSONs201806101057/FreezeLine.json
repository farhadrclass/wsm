That\u2019s the case in Freeze Line. Shane does his best to avoid his werewolf attributes. He lives far above the freeze line, where the earth is frozen and magic is weak. It can\u2019t pull on his beast. He puts on a human front around the others in the nearby village, but for the most part lives a solitary life.Then he finds Nadia on the side of the road. She\u2019s not equipped for the frigid weather. He quickly learns she was kidnapped by humans wanting to torture and test on her because of her ability to use magic. The knowledge alone spurs his instinct to protect her. But the lack of magic in the earth is killing her. He agrees to take the woman south, to save her. The closer they get to the magic, the stronger she gets and the more wild he becomes.He may be worried about his beast hurting her. His past tells him he can\u2019t be trusted around others when his wolf takes over. Nadia is stronger than he knows, and the two can\u2019t help but bond.Freeze Line is a fun, quick romance read with the best paranormal elements of the three in the Winter Wishes anthology. Moira Rogers is able to focus on the \u2018otherness\u2019 is a complete way, even in the shorter form of novellas."}, {"userName": "Mara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3954707-mara", "userReview": "One of the sweeter love stories from the wonder duo that makes the Moria Rogers writing team. It's short and less steamy than their usual novellas. But don't take it as a negative feedback. It is not. It simply shows how versatile they are as authors."}, {"userName": "Ana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7608352-ana", "userReview": "Dramatic yet sweet and romantic.

And this winter they have a new novella coming out from Carina Press, part of the Winter Wishes anthology (with greats Vivian Arend and Vivi Andrews) that can be purchased as part of the anthology, or a stand alone novella.An ice age has hit the earth again, and Shane is living well above the freeze line. Because of his werewolf magic, he fears going to live closer to the border, because the tight control he has over his wolf slips the closer he gets to the warmth. He enjoys his solitary life in a small town, making ends meet any way he can.Out on his snowmobile one afternoon has him running across Nadia, a witch left to die in the frozen wastelands. Nadia was kidnapped by a group of werewolves and tortured endlessly. But Shane is her only hope, and she puts her trust in him.As the two journey closer to the border, Shane notices his wolf coming more to the forefront, while Nadia\u2019s power grows as well. As the two learn to lean and count on each other, they struggle to find a way to be together although they can\u2019t live in each other\u2019s worlds.The Rogers team does an amazing job with their world building and Freeze Line is no exception. I\u2019ve always loved the different takes on what the world will be like post-apocalyptic, and the ice age is always a fun one!I really liked Nadia and Shane together, both hesitant to trust and rely on each other, but both drawn to each other like a moth to a flame. And the way they are able to make a conscious decision to be together, and actually make it work, warms my heart.If you\u2019re looking for a short and sweet classic romance with a paranormal twist, you need to pick this one up! My only gripe: I really wish it would have been longer so that some of the questions left opened were answered.All in all, I give Freeze Line 3.5 out of 5 post-apocalyptic ice ages!"}, {"userName": "Ally", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/990135-ally", "userReview": "A twenty-first century ice age dulls the magic that emanates from the earth.

Happily, I can say I was dead wrong. Freeze Line was something new, different and fresh for me and I really loved it.Nadia was a truly great character and I really enjoyed her. It was great to see her go from a weak person, having to rely on Shane to being a tough, stubborn, kick ass female who knew who she was. I really liked Shane too but at times I really want to yell \u2018bad wolf\u2019 at him and give him a good talking too. Not like he\u2019d listen! But in the end it all worked out and I really enjoyed Nadia and Shane\u2019s different but sweet story.Favourite Quotes:\u201cShe was weak, she\u2019d been hurt and the wolf wanted to make someone pay\u201d\u201cAfter all the pain, all the longing, their goodbye was anticlimactic.\u201dOverall, I really enjoyed this short story by Moira Rogers, I would definitely recommend it to paranormal fans."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3344685-sarah", "userReview": "An ice age has split the world in two, above the freeze line the cold has dulled the earth's magic making it a safer place for werewolf Shane to live. The last thing he wants is the magic calling to his animal nature. Nadia is a witch who needs to be able to connect to the magic to survive, she was kidnapped and forced above the freeze line so that she was unable to protect herself using her magic. She may have escaped but she needs to find a way home and restore her energy levels or she won't survive. When Shane finds Nadia by the side of the road and discovers what has happened to her he offers to help get her back to the other side of the freeze line. As they approach their destination Nadia becomes stronger but Shane's wild side gets closer to the surface, can they fight the attraction that is growing between them? Do they even want to?I was already a big fan of Moira Rogers so it was no surprise to me that I loved Freeze Line. With the apocalyptic setting this story is darker than the other novellas in the Winter Wishes anthology but I really enjoyed the world building and would happily read more stories in this world if it becomes a series. Shane and Nadia are both great characters and I love the way their relationship develops as the get to know each other. This was a sweet and sexy romance and one I'd definitely recommend."}, {"userName": "Lillie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5864176-lillie", "userReview": "I have two disclaimers for this review.1. Moira Rogers is an auto-buy for me. I have loved every single book by this author.2. I hadn\u2019t finished a futuristic romance before reading Freeze Line. I had tried a few and they were all DNFs. This just wasn\u2019t my genre.So what do I do when I\u2019m offered an ARC of a post-apocalyptic paranormal romance by an auto-buy author? I take the book, of course :D And I\u2019m very happy that I did.We have a sexy werewolf tormented by his past but he\u2019s willing to face it to help a stranger. Then we have a heroine who has been a powerful warrior for her entire life but now has to depend on someone else just for basic survival. Add in some serious chemistry and what appears to be insurmountable odds against them and you have a book that I couldn\u2019t put down.This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that I will run out and buy every futuristic romance I can get my hands on but it does mean that if Moira Rogers decides to do another book in this setting, I will happily read it. And it means that maybe I\u2019ll stop paying so much attention to labels associated with a book and just enjoy the experience. Futuristic, sci-fi, post apocalyptic, paranormal\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter which genre you group it in. It is a great romance about a man and woman overcoming personal struggles, finding love, and being willing to fight for that love."}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3538399-tina", "userReview": "Sensuality: 4 out of 5Kink: Stranger sex, d/sWow another great story from Moira Rogers! Loved the setting which is an unusual one, the Artic North America after some kind of apocalypse. I liked the story over all and Shane was so reserved and afraid he would hurt her. I really wanted him to be a little more alpha but it was still good.. There were a few questions that I had. We dont' know much about what went on at the lab that the heroine was taken to and I would have liked to have a little bit more about why they wanted her. We also don't get to know much about her sister other than she married an opposing tribe member and left with him. The politics of the tribes needed more fleshing out. But since this was a short story all of these things would be nice to make it longer. However it did flow good and it made sense over all with these things not discussed in too much detail. A good writer always makes you want to know more about the characters so to me it was a good book."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2974294-jessica", "userReview": "I received an ARC of this through NetGalley. Stories are available in the anthology Winter Wishes or separately.After the humor and lightness of the first two stories in the anthology, entering this dark, cold, dystopian landscape was quite a shock. At it's best, it was like a fabulous blend of Ilona Andrews and '90s-era Linda Howard--tender, sexy and adventurous. At it's worst, there were some awkward transitions, both in writing and in character development, that made me wonder if perhaps some scenes had been edited out because of space constraints. Overall, though, I enjoyed the characters enough to hope that the authors plan to write more stories in the saga of Shane and Nadia."}, {"userName": "ValerieC", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4289213-valeriec", "userReview": "I almost quit reading this several times.
