Two years before, an assignment to follow a strayed husband and his mistress appeared simple enough, but this routine job left George a transformed man.Suspenseful, moving, and hailed by critics as a detective story unlike any other, The Light of Day is a gripping tale of murder and redemption, as well as a bold exploration of love and self-discovery. Opening: \"Something\u2019s come over you.\u201d That\u2019s what Rita said, over two years ago now, and now she knows it wasn\u2019t just a thing of the moment.Something happens. We cross a line, we open a door we never knew was there. It might never have happened, we might never have known. Most of life, maybe, is only time served.Morning traffic in Wimbledon Broadway. Exhausts steaming. I turn the key in the street door, my own breath coming in clouds.\u201cSomething\u2019s come over you, George.\u201dBut she knew even before I did.A clever, heart-wrenching 'day in the life of' story, which slightly echoed the poignant 'End of the Affair' by Graham Greene.

George Webb, a disgraced policeman, now works as a private detective, investigating the extra-marital affairs of the spouses of his clients. However, he gets emotionally involved with the case of Sarah Nash, whose husband had an affair with the Croatian refugee they sheltered in their home.I didn't like it. I couldn't stand the prose style. He often uses short, pseudo-emotional sentences that lack a verb phrase (though don't quote me on that - I'm no expert on syntax) and rhetorical questions. I'll quote a bit:\"Or forgotten? Deliberately wiped from the record? A missing file. No, not here. You must be thinking of somewhere else.\"To me, this is just plain bad writing. I used to write like that. I still write like that when I'm not writing well, and I read over it later and shudder. It's a crude, unsophisticated method to try and create an emotional atmosphere, and it fails. Every time.Other times, he slips into long, flowing sentences with far too much punctuation, which is just as bad:\"But this, this now, can't be what she would have imagined for me, what she would have wished. This woman in my life. That I'd be going, once a fortnight, two years now, to see - this prisoner. This killer.\"Again, bad writing. It's better when he uses sentences of normal length, but then it slips into mediocrity. Frankly, I can't believe it won a Booker Prize.The chapters are short and bitty - nothing useful is said, ever. It is the final triumph of style over substance. Swift spends most of the novel skirting around the big issues, because he's evidently under the impression that withholding key elements of the plot for as long as is physically possible makes readers happy. I actually tend not to mind this, as long as the style is enthralling enough to keep me occupied, as in Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go, for example. It also helps for the book to be gripping enough that I don't notice the suppression of information that would make the story make sense. Gripping, however, is not how to describe The Light of Day. It's been ages since I counted pages so much. I was willing it to end.The praise for this novel has been excessive. Arena says: \"A book so shot through with pent-up emotion that it practically trembles in your hands.\" I looked so hard for that pent-up emotion, but I could not for the life of me find it.However, perhaps I'm being overly harsh. Here are some other points made by the critics, who are quoted liberally on the cover (inside and out), perhaps trying to convince the innocent Swift-hater that there is something worthwhile to be found in this pile of random words that claims to be a novel: * \"how to explain the inexplicable things in life: the strangeness of love at first sight, love like a blow to the heart, love for the duration?\" Guardian * \"sees the poetry and the tragedy lurking in an ordinary life\" Irish Times * \"Asks profound questions about how we live and love\" Big IssueThere's also much praise for his \"prose of such sensitivity\" - um, where is it? On the other hand, I can sort of see where they're coming from with the points I quoted above, if I squint, turn my head sideways and think of a different book. But I couldn't for the life of me get past the execrable prose."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/849475-barb", "userReview": "At first this novel reminded me of 'The Maltese Falcon' or 'The Big Sleep', the protagonist is a big tough ex-cop turned private detective.

He relives the day that he wished he could go back and change and he reflects on love but his isn't a sappy romantic love it's a somewhat stoic love.I really liked Swift's writing style, it's succinct and reserved but moving at the same time.

Which isn't to say it is a bad book - I found it to be well written and probably would have enjoyed it immensely were the subject matter to my liking.The theme seems a little cliched. The protagonist is an Private Investigator, an ex-cop (wow, really?) who was chucked off the force because he was dirty, except he wasn't really firty, just doing his job (who'd have thought?). His wife left him (duh) and he falls in love with a client (oh, th suspense) after only having met her a few times while he followed her cheating husband, whom she then kills (because that's what betrayed housewifes do, I guess...)So, the story is cliched, and the main characters are cliched - George the ex-cop, Sarah the murderess, Bob the cheating Gyno husband - and all three aren't particularly likable. It's the supporting cast who interested me; George's grown up daughter Helen, Helen's girlfriend Claire, and George's secretary Rita. See, I like Rita a lot, and I cannot understand how George falls for Sarah (who seems amazingly bland) when he has smart, feiry, attractive Rita right there ready to become more than work-mates. George is an idiot.The writing style is interesting, told from George's point of view, skipping perspectives from two years after the murder, to the murder, to before the murder, but these changes are easy to follow, and make the story more interesting than if it was told linearly, because I knew from the beginning what was going to happen, no need for the suspense of keeping the murder to the end.And speaking of, I found the end to be amazingly anti-climatic. Like...there's an actual final chapter or two missing, because it just ends. Nothing new happens, it's just George, thinking that maybe in another eight years, if he's good and visits every second Thursday, maybe they'll let him take Sarah home. Coz, gee wow, I didn't already know that, having read about it for 250 pages...But still, just because it wasn't to my liking, doesn't mean it's a bad book..."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3985317-tom", "userReview": "Swift can lead you to the brink of sheer boredom and somehow pull you into the clutches of pure fascination.

The stream-of-consciousness style of narration was all over the place as private investigator George Webb mused about his case involving femme fatale Sarah, who really didn't seem all that much for him to get so worked up over, as well as his childhood, his leaving the police force in disgrace, his failed marriage and so on and so on. It felt very unfocused with no real mystery, or tension and a rather limp romance. However, Swift has previously won the Man Booker and his works are considered literary rather than genre fiction, so maybe not a surprise that this flaunted the conventions of crime fiction and was more an examination of a man's thoughts on one particular day. The Light of Day was itself long-listed for the Man Booker in 2003. This was a reading group selection and I wasn't surprised that all of the group apart from one was not impressed with it. Like myself no one felt it was a bad novel, more just 'meh'. The member had read and enjoyed other of his novels so likely was prepared for his style. We did all agree that George Webb's feelings for Sarah were quite tragic and it did generate discussion about this point. It has been a week since I read it and it is one of those novels that I've appreciated more with a little time. Despite the rambling style the novel's heart about this rather sad, down-at-the-heels man having hope for the future has remained with me as did Swift's meticulous mapping of George's day in London. As a result I have amended my score on Goodreads."}, {"userName": "Seth", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1939273-seth", "userReview": "I had remembered liking \"Last Orders,\" but I hadn't exactly put Graham Swift on my list of authors to exhaustively read. Based on a friend's recommendation and the need to quickly decide on something before traveling, I grabbed this one. The book I read just before this one had been somewhat depressing, and \"Light of Day\" seemed like it was headed that way also. But the story was told with an incredible tenderness, and that helped make the book more relatable. The main character went through a great deal of introspection, which is another thing I can relate to. The way the story was told was interesting. I wouldn't exactly say that there were layers to the story--early on, you figure out the basic details of the plot and those don't really change through the pages--but it's more like there are facets that keep getting added, giving depth to the characters and to the emotions they are feeling. The steps through a single day and the reflections that come along the way are very believable and very real. I'll definitely be checking out more Graham Swift.

It took some time for me to identify the characters and the sequence of events.However, too many questions remained unanswered, including the motivation for Sarah's crime, and what lay behind the apparent obsession George developed for Sarah. That relationship is one of the strangest 'love' affairs, if that's what it is, that I have ever encountered.Well written and occasionally fascinating, but ultimately not quite satisfying."}, {"userName": "Norton Stone", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13052425-norton-stone", "userReview": "The idea of a Private Detective falling for his client and then finding himself involved in a murder is sound, unfortunately Swift's pace, which is arrested by his poetic prose, (for me anyway) runs counter to the twists and turns of an unfolding murder mystery. Now I concede you could argue this is in fact a love story, but I simply could not buy the MC's, George Webb, infatuation with Sarah Nash. The relationship had no foundation other than a chance meeting in a supermarket. We learn much of Webb's past which allows us to believe he has been unlucky professionally and in love but in the end none of it really adds to the plot other than to portray a man in a state of constant existential questioning. \"You cross a line.\" \"How do you choose?\" and so on. There are few surprises, perhaps the most heart rending line is when Webb's father is in a delirious decline towards death and calls for Carol, a secret lover, in front of his wife and Webb.For me this was a Swift B Movie. Even the murdered man's lover had a back story which was started but again had no real relevance.From about halfway the book meanders to an inevitable conclusion. Webb doesn't lurch erratically as he becomes attracted to his client, he is if anything lacking an emotional dimension. Swifts writes this in the first person as Webb, who has been encouraged to take up writing by his client. To that end you could excuse this as deliberately even in it's pitch, but like the love affair I'm not buying that.

Firstly, why George was kicked out of the police force, and secondly how Sarah, who George is seemingly in love with, wound up in jail. The story switches between the past and present, allowing Swift to create dozens of \u2018suspenseful\u2019 moments \u2013 there were too many in my opinion and I was irritated by the repetitive structure.Thankfully, Swift\u2019s writing is fine \u2013 although much plainer and less atmospheric than Mothering Sunday (which I adored), there were some thoughtful passages \u2013Coincidences happen. I only half believe in them. I\u2019m a detective. We see what we\u2019re ready to see.Much of George\u2019s business is catching philandering husbands in the act. This is used to give context to George\u2019s thoughts on his own ex-wife, his parent\u2019s marriage, and the historical story of Empress Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s union with Napoleon III (which although interesting, wasn\u2019t compelling enough to have me hitting Google at the time\u2026).2/5 Disappointing."}, {"userName": "Simon Firth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15808657-simon-firth", "userReview": "This is Swift's follow up to Last Orders and it turns out to be be more of a chamber piece than his preceding work or the stunning early Waterland that made his name. Here a British private detective, George Webb, narrates a day in his life that both marks and recalls a domestic murder with which he was intimately connected. The nature of that intimacy, however, is opaque, since it revolves around a kind of love - yearning, not-fully requited, possibly deeply foolish - that doesn't completely involve the two people at its heart. That's both a rare and brave subject in fiction. And it's both a strength and difficulty of the story that George himself is so often a passive witness to events. Even when he intervenes, he ends up being more observer than anything. It makes for a perfectly persuasive portrait, but also not an entirely compelling experience for the reader (hence three and not four Goodreads stars). A saving grace is the sub-narrative of George's learning to cook and then to write as the chronology progresses. The final novel can easily be read as the fruit of that hard won journey toward human growth and self-understanding."}, {"userName": "Melania", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40773587-melania", "userReview": "Lumina zilei\" (2003) are aparenta unui roman politist, al carui pretext este o crima pasionala. Misterul ce urmeaza a fi dezlegat nu priveste insa autorul crimei, ci imprejurarile care l-au impins sa comita acest gest disperat. Povestea dureroasa din spatele asasinatului este relatata din perspectiva anchetatorului, George Webb, detectiv particular si fost politist. Crima nu este subiectul romanului ci reactiile personajelor fata de ea sunt descrise in carte.Sotul care inseala sotia cu croata saraca primita in casa de sotie.Sotia care pana in ultima clipa nu arata ca ar vrea sa isi ucida sotul.Detectivul care se indragosteste de clienta lui care ii cere sa ii urmeareasca sotul si care atunci cand este inchisa contin ua sa vina la inchisoare si sa spere ca odata eliberata va relua viata cu ea.Stilul este bolovanos pe alocuri, actiunea este condensata intr.o zi cu pendulari intre trecut si prezent."}], "description": "On the anniversary of a life-shattering event, George Webb, a former policeman turned private detective, revisits the catastrophes of his past and reaffirms the extraordinary direction of his future. Two years before, an assignment to follow a strayed husband and his mistress appeared simple enough, but this routine job left George a transformed man.Suspenseful, moving, and hailed by critics as a detective story unlike any other, The Light of Day is a gripping tale of murder and redemption, as well as a bold exploration of love and self-discovery.
