This book of short stories is it! Read so close to the novel is probably the way to do it, because surely half the stories are about the same two people that the novel is about. I'm guessing this is something close to something that happened to the author and she has been writing about it ever since, packaging it as fiction. So some of these stories add on to the novel, actually, and are a nice companion.Otherwise there are a few stories that dabble in fantasy/absurd elements - I didn't love these, especially didn't understand the runners with statues. Most memorable is probably the story of the older woman trying to mail a letter to the president.Every story is set on Lookout Mtn. the area that crosses the border of Georgia and Tennessee. I wish I'd known about this book when I went there at the end of November as the place matters more in these stories than in the one book I found to read there.

Runners in a special race must carry phallic statues or face punishment. A boy with a rare condition uses a girl with cancer to cure himself. A married wife and a married man have a lot of dirty, secret phone sex together, except not with their respective spouses.Dark, gritty, and erotic, Quatro's collection I Want to Show You More will interest those who want to read about infidelity, religion, and running. Half of her stories, such as Georgia the Whole Time and Better to Lose an Eye, stick with realism and explore family tensions. The other half, ranging from Ladies and Gentlemen of the Pavement to Demolition, move more in the direction of magical realism. While not my favorite collection of short stories, I feel glad that I can say I started my 2015 off with an ensemble that features people running around with genitalia, as well as a heartfelt and honest portrayal of grief.

Reviews in the NY Times and The New Yorker, blurbs from David Means, David Gates, Tom Bissell, Sven Birkerts, etc. James Wood caught tones of Flannery O'Connor (the grotesque) and Lydia Davis (the flash fiction-ish stories); Dwight Garner focused on Quatro's sexual themes and suggested a comparison to Donald Barthelme in her allegories. Myself I detected the influence of George Saunders, especially in the story about the marathon runners carrying the statues, and the dead body-in-the-bed story. (I just Googled Jamie Quatro + George Saunders to confirm that I'm not the only one to see that.) I think she's just really good no matter whom she's drawing from. I didn't really \"like\" those two stories I just mentioned - they were unsettling in their subject matter and sort of unsatisfying in their elliptical-ness (these aren't novel-like Alice Munro stories or densely worded Jim Shepard stories).

It's a quick read, but not lightweight. Many of the stories are interconnected, and that story was really beautifully done. I didn't wish it was told more chronologically or was simply a novel; instead I enjoyed reading the different pieces of it as they came. Actually, I liked it so much, I *do* wish I could read it as a novel, but I think it worked quite well as it was. Several of the stories introduce more fantastic elements: a married couple returns home to find the wife's lover dead in their bed--but it is a wax statue that is decomposing that they are dealing with; a tale of marathon runners who mysteriously receive sculpture they must carry with them as they run; and \"Demolition,\" the story of the transformation of a church, is a beautiful experiment in magical realism.The language is elegant and concise. Even in stories that use narrative techniques I normally don't care for (second person narration, or first person plural), I didn't find those techniques distracting."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth A", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a", "userReview": "I'm not a fan of the short story, as they often feel rushed and ultimately not satisfying to me. You probably already know this about me, and were wondering why I picked up yet another collection. So imagine my delight when I started this book, and found myself having to slow down to stop from binge reading it in one sitting. These interlocking stories explore God, sex, religion, faith, love, infidelity, parenting, aging, loss, running, well, the human condition really, albeit a privileged one. Sure, some stories are stronger than others, but each and every one had me pause somewhere in the reading, and re-read a line or two. The juxtaposition of the surreal with the horribly realistic is so well done, and the honesty of the writing is such a breath of fresh air. Here is my advice if you decide to read it: Do not read it all in one sitting. Stay soft while reading this collection. Remind yourself that we are all human, and fallible, and doing the best we can. Can you read these stories without being judgy? Try it and let me know."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/802066-lauren", "userReview": "This is one of those books I should like, but I don't, and then I feel dumb because perhaps the reason I don't like it is because I don't understand it and if I were smarter I would like it.

Quatro mixes surreal and fabulist elements with sharp and illuminating details about everyday life to create a collection of compelling stories that challenge us to think about the stories that we tell ourselves each day. Her characters are reliably unpredictable in their modest desperation. Many of the stories tell the stories of characters attempting to reconcile modern secularity with the surreal stories with which they have been raised, and the powerful, earnest, disquietude this creates.To illustrate: running throughout the collection is a narrative about a tired housewife who is having an online affair with a man halfway across the country. Some of the stories carrying this narrative are straightforward realist narratives, stories about having sexually explicit conversations with this man on a cell phone while her children attend piano lessons in the same room. Other of these stories, though, are powerfully and emotionally complex -- it is as if these have taken on the delusions of their narrator, and they refuse to admit any dissonance between the ongoing affair, and the dishonesty that continues to grow between this character and her faithful and patient husband. Yet another story carrying the thread of this narrative depicts the time just after the affair has been revealed and has ended. In this story, the main character and her husband arrive home to discover a corpse in their bed. She grieves over it and tries to find ways to pay it proper respects, while he -- the husband -- continues to insist in frustration that the corpse is merely made of wax; it's not real and never has been.Now, this description might make it sound as if Quatro sometimes falls back into obvious allegory or extended narrative metaphor -- but that's not quite it. There is nothing obvious about these stories. Each of them evades simple interpretation, and even the most extremely fabulist stories fight to complicate these metaphors.Really solid collection. I love, love, love it!"}, {"userName": "Sue Bridehead (A Pseudonym)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/792145-sue-bridehead-a-pseudonym", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this off-beat interconnected selection of short stories. I liked the way it's rooted in two places (Lookout Mountain, GA/TN and Phoenix, AZ). I like that it deals with issues of faith, which you don't see too much in contemporary short fiction. I like that characters recur but you're not 100% certain they're recurring at first, because they have no names and the only things that keep coming around again are a sexless affair and a number of children. I like that there are a few stories that seem to come out of left field, but seem thematically related (for example, they deal with death, or guilt, or running).Overall, it's a great example of a unique voice rooted in a particular background (educated Southern Christian with doubts about sin/belief).A day after finishing this, one story keeps bouncing around in my mind, and it's perhaps the most allegorical one, about a woman running a marathon with a statue tied to her back. I can't stop trying to riddle out what it all means. In the entire collection, I feel there's one false note. I didn't like the second-to-last story, where a woman runs down a mountain and finds refuge in a halfway house, where she longs to move in and be accepted and supported by people with mental illness, violent home lives, and non-white skin. Really? I felt that this yearning in the character should have been more fully explored. It's an uncomfortable notion, the idea that one would \"descend\" to one's lowest point and flee one's family, only to find refuge in the care and attentions of people who have it far worse (people of color, people from violent households, people with mental illness). I get what she was going for, I think, but I didn't feel great about how she handled it. It irks me when characters get their unearned epiphanies from interactions with people outside the mainstream.Still, that one story didn't detract too much. Overall it's a very interesting and unique collection."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1355037-angela", "userReview": "At first, I thought this collection of short stories was over-done.

The betrayals Quatro depicts are earnest and immature and, were it not for her decided talent at creating a context for them in the elegance of her prose, a bit silly, too.Quatro brings this same depth of inquiry to religious faith and what can be accomplished with distance running. She depicts brutally, and appropriately, the shallow fanaticism of Southern religiosity and the American evangelical tradition - though perhaps more brutally and more tellingly than she knows.She asks very interesting questions about cancer, however, questions that raise themselves merely with how ubiquitous of a theme cancer has become in the American narrative, a ubiquitousness Quatro loyally reports.Most of the stories in I Want to Show You More are secondary-school subjects explored by a talented adult. That is the very reverse, and the very blessed reverse, of what most American short-fiction now offers its readers."}, {"userName": "Nina Schuyler", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4935741-nina-schuyler", "userReview": "While a short story collection can be knitted together in a lot of different ways\u2014character, theme, setting, subject matter or tone\u2014how tightly it should be woven is less defined. Some collections are so knotted that all the life is wrung out of them. Others are so loose it feels as if the writer had to dig deep to fill up pages.In her debut collection, I Want to Show You More, Jamie Quatro has accomplished a rare paradox: the collection is stitched together and, yet, it\u2019s loose and baggy, letting in a lot of surprise. Short shorts live next to long stories; surrealism is neighbors with realism. You can hear the murmurs of Flannery O\u2019Connor, and also George Saunders, Lorrie Moore and Donald Barthelme. Thematic threads hold some of it together\u2014God, transcendence, adultery, running, illness, and family. And in a few of the stories, we revisit some of the same characters.The stories are all set in Lookout Mountain, Georgia, which straddles Georgia and Tennessee. It\u2019s a perfect metaphor for Quatro\u2019s collection: bagginess and a tight weaving coexisting. It\u2019s bound to frustrate some readers and delight others.

I have ached for days after reading it. How often does that happen with a work of fiction? The last time a story moved me so strongly was when I first read Kafka's \"The Metamorphosis\"; I couldn't stop crying, and I cry every time I read it again. Jamie Quatro's story of the old woman with failing faculties walking to the post office to deliver a letter to George W. Bush protesting the war, and his response, is too powerful for words.Quatro's work does remind me of Kafka. Certainly some of the settings and scenes are Kafkaesque, even if they are set near Lookout Mountain, Tennessee and Georgia. But she has her own voice (already!) and a way of involving the reader in a collaborative story-telling effort\u2014like the best flash fiction does\u2014as she teases us into our own imaginings even as she masterfully shapes the narrative.Speaking of flash fiction, some of the stories are very short, as is true of flash, but some are longer. The stories all stand on their own but also reverberate across the entire collection. There is a very big small community in these pages, and it will surprise you.

She delivers a shock that runs through your system when you realize what it is that you think she is saying.The coolest thing to me about this collection was how loosely connected various stories are.

Ms. Quatro's seemingly endless obsession with adultery left me impatient, and her take on it frequently banal and uninteresting. There's material here for one really good short story about adultery, but spread over six stories there just isn't enough to hold my interest. And some of the other stories - '1.7 to Tennessee', 'Sinkhole' - were clear misfires, while others ('Better to Lose an Eye') amounted to little more than a good anecdote stretched out to story length. The one bright spot for me in this collection was 'Georgia The Whole Time' - a perfect gem of a story that I went back and read again just to savor its clear-eyed yet poignant brilliance.

Quatro also writes beautifully the elements of infidelity, the desire and confusion of such realtionships. As a marathoner, I loved the pieces about running, especially the second story about the marathon runners and their statutes. That story is definitely a must read for any runner.

La scegli non tanto perch\u00e9 \u00e8 cristiana, ma perch\u00e9 ha lo studio a Hixson, il punto pi\u00f9 lontano possibile da Lookout Mountain entro i confini della citt\u00e0. Bobbie ti chiede di elencare dieci ricordi positivi e dieci negativi della tua infanzia. Le dici che non \u00e8 quello il motivo per cui ti sei rivolta a lei.Le dici che ti senti come un cocomero in pancia.Le dici che ogni frase che eri abituata a comporre per l\u2019altro uomo \u2013 ogni pensiero ed emozione che eri abituata a condividere con lui \u2013 adesso si insedia permanentemente nel tuo corpo.Le dici che forse hai solo bisogno di scaricarti.Pensavo fossi venuta perch\u00e9 volevi salvare il tuo matrimonio, interviene Bobbie.Anche per quello, rispondi.Nella maggior parte dei casi, continua, troviamo che la donna \u00e8 mancata di autoaffermazione durante l\u2019infanzia. Cercheremo di individuare le menzogne della tua infanzia e, utilizzando diverse tecniche come ad esempio le terapie basate sui movimenti dell\u2019occhio, le sostituiremo con delle verit\u00e0.E se la verit\u00e0 \u00e8 che sono innamorata di lui?, domandi.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Anna Groover", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66386726-anna-groover", "userReview": "After reading a selection of stories from I Want to Show You More for a class last semester, I knew I wanted to read the entire collection. I didn't get around to doing so until a class I'm in this semester--Christianity and Modernity--kept bringing up many of the themes and ideas I think are present in Quatro's stories. Her stories are dark, theological, and I would even go so far as to say that they're fairly twisted. They're about women caught in situations of intense inner turmoil, women who want to be faithful and good but continually fail at that. Many of the stories are interrelated, but not all of them are. They all take place in a town that is divided in half along the Tennessee-Georgia border are concerned with religion, family, fidelity, and running. While I like the stand-alone stories quite a bit--\"Demolition,\" one of the weirdest and most disconcerting ones, was a favorite of mine out of the whole collection--I most enjoyed the six or seven or so stories about the same unnamed woman. She's caught up in an Augustinian \"I am a question unto myself\" dilemma--she's been having an emotional affair with a distant man, and she just wants to love her husband again--but the problem is, she can't forgive herself for it. These stories are weird and moving in the best possible way, and I love that Quatro allows her female characters to be reprehensible and bad on their own terms, in a vein similar to that of Roxane Gay's \"Difficult Women.\""}], "description": "Sharp-edged and fearless, mixing white-hot yearning with daring humor, Jamie Quatro\u2019s debut collection is a beautiful and disquieting portrait of infidelity, faith, and family.The hypnotically intimate, urgent stories in I Want to Show You More are about lives stretched between spirituality and sexuality in the New American South. In narrative modes ranging from the traditional to the fabulist, these stories are interconnected explorations of God, illicit sex, raising children\u2014and running. Jamie Quatro\u2019s stories confront us with dark theological complexities, fractured marriages, and mercurial temptations: a wife comes home with her husband to find her lover\u2019s corpse in their bed; a teenager attends a Bible Camp where he seduces a young cancer survivor with hopes of curing his own rare condition; marathon runners on a Civil War battlefield must carry phallic statues and are punished if they choose to unload their burdens; a girl\u2019s embarrassment over attending a pool party with her quadriplegic mother turns to fierce devotion under the pitying gaze of other guests; and a husband asks his wife to show him how she would make love to another man.I Want to Show You More unleashes Quatro\u2019s exhilarating talent for exposing the quiet terrors of modern life with stunning and subversive energy.\"A brilliant new voice in American fiction has arrived. Bright, sharp, startling, utterly distinctive, passionate, and secretive, Quatro\u2019s stories are missives from deep within the landscape of American womanhood. . . . She has earned a place alongside Amy Hempel, Lydia Davis, and Alice Munro.\u201d\u2014David Means, author of Assorted Fire Events and The Spot\"Fasten your seat belt: Jamie Quatro is a writer of great talent who knows how to take a dark turn without ever tapping the brakes and then bring you back into daylight with breathtaking precision. These amazing stories explore the human boundaries between the physical world and the spiritual\u2014lust, betrayal, and loss in perfect balance with love, redemption, and grace.\u201d\u2014Jill McCorkle", "title": "I Want to Show You More", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15712681-i-want-to-show-you-more", "average": 3.66, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1361835600l/15712681.jpg", "reviews": 214, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6426025.Jamie_Quatro", "name": "Jamie Quatro"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Fiction", "American"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15712681-i-want-to-show-you-more", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31448799-voglio-mostrarti-di-pi", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35412371-fire-sermon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39724976-i-want-to-show-you-more", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32788771-wave-function-collapse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18240206-the-o-henry-prize-stories-2013", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15739831-forty-stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
