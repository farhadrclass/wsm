Jim Harrison is a U.S. Air Force test pilot who risks his life on a daily basis. Grace is a devoted wife that waits anxiously for her husband to walk through the door every night, hoping his photo won\u2019t be the next on the wall of dead pilots down at the local bar. It\u2019s the late 1940s and by day the men push the limits at Muroc Field in the Mojave Desert. At night they can usually be found unwinding and sharing stories at Pancho\u2019s. \"Pancho\u2019s place sat squat in six acres of bone-dry desert taut with Joshua trees. It has a wooden veranda, flyscreen door and looked like hell. She served scotch and beer and highballs and called it the Happy Bottom Riding Club.\" Pancho has a very colorful and sensational history, she loves to cuss and taunt the men to no end \u2013 but all in good fun. This eccentric has a heart of gold and you would be lucky indeed to have her on your side. Fast forward to the late 1950s/early 1960s. The Space Race is in full throttle and America does not want to fall behind the Soviets. \"We\u2019re standing still. The American man is drinking beer on his sofa in front of his new television set, while the Soviets are toiling, sweating and bleeding, becoming masters of the universe. Maybe Average Joe should concern himself less with the depth of the pile in his new broadloom rug, or the height of the tail fin on his new car.\" NASA is looking for qualified men for the astronaut program, and Jim Harrison fits the bill. Choices will need to be made as Jim and Grace also face significant changes in their personal lives. Can Jim turn his back on this momentous opportunity or will he need to make considerable sacrifices to stay in the race?I enjoyed this debut novel by Benjamin Johncock. The backdrop of the Mojave Desert appealed to my desire to read about places I\u2019ve never been, to experience them through books. I learned a lot about test piloting and the NASA program, and appreciated a glimpse of real-life figures like Deke Slayton, Chuck Yeager, Jim Lovell, and John Glenn, that surrounded the fictional characters of this novel. The technical aspects at times went a bit over my head. I felt it was expected that I would be a bit savvier regarding aircraft and aerospace technology coming into this book. The prose was spare and this doesn\u2019t typically detract from my fondness for a book. However, the lack of quotation marks throughout the book made me double back many times to determine who was speaking \u2013 especially when multiple characters were present during many of the conversations. I felt a certain distance towards the characters at various times throughout the novel. However, there were moments when I could sense the real anguish, the torment of those experiencing immense tragedy. These moments became so authentic that I have high expectations from this author and what he can accomplish with his writing. \"Live your life. Don\u2019t waste it lamenting what you think is required to complete it.\""}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "www.melissa413readsalot.blotspot.comI thought this book was really sad. It's good but it's sad too. You have Harrison who is a test pilot for the US Airforce and his wife Grace. Every day there is the fear that Jim isn't going to make it back home. I think the author did a great job at explaining some things a test pilot does that I would have never known. But this book isn't just about that, it's about friends and family. Jim and Grace have a hard time trying to have kids and they have some really horrible things happen to them. It was nice to just step into another world where life just seems to be going along, history, heartaches, just life. I must say my favorite and the funniest person in the book is Pancho. She owns a bar and she puts up with nothing from no one. I loved hearing about her story in the book. I'm not going to tell it here, but let me say she went through it.. all the way through it and came out on top with a thriving business and close friends.

You can read about the plot elsewhere, but for me, the beauty of this novel is in the balance of the dialogue; the sustained emotion that runs through the whole; the haiku-like simplicity of the prose (and trust me, it takes a long, long time to create that sense of effortlessness). Like so many of America's stories, this is a Western in disguise; a quiet, limpid Western, where the action mostly takes place in the air and in the chambers of the heart. To me, it reads like the the reclusive disciple of Cormac McCarthy and St-Exup\u00e9ry, and if it doesn't get at least on the shortlist of a major literary prize, then the book world is even more clueless than I've always suspected..."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly", "userReview": "I really don't want to write a lukewarm review, but I didn't like this much and know a couple of reasons why. Johncock has some nice descriptions of the Mohave desert, and empty bars, and loneliness, and the cold interior of the cockpit. But I found his dialogue truly boring and hated the family story - the marital arguments, the wife's shrillness, the protagonist's taciturnity, the tragic deaths, the general sentimentality - it read like a Lifetime movie script. Also, I disagree with those who think the novel was well-researched: I may be wrong but I got the impression Johncock studied Tom Wolfe and that's it. So much of the first half of the novel came straight out of The Right Stuff - I don't just mean the history, which is public property, but actual scenes and dialogue from the book and the film. Isn't there anything else about that American time/place to mine for good fiction? What he didn't borrow was Wolfe's journalistic energy! I admit that I long ago imprinted on Wolfe's version: The Right Stuff was my favorite book when I was fifteen, supplanted only by Norman Mailer's The Executioner's Song (guess how I learned my history?), so for me this subject matter - Air Force test pilots and life & death and the early days of the space program - calls for kinetic energy, wordplay (\"pushing the envelope\"), macho boasting, and a judicious use of honest profanity.

He\u2019s flying the X-1: basically a rocket launched from the belly of an airborne B-29 bomber, which is fuel-injected craziness, but Jim and his buddies aren\u2019t fools.

I was a child when the whole country held its collective breath as Alan Shepard coolly exclaimed, \u201cLet\u2019s light this candle\u201d and became the first American to orbit the Earth. Dewy-eyed, I worshipped a whole new group of heroes.The mastery of The Last Pilot is that within its pages, the heroes become human. The story centers on the fictional pilot Jim Harrison, who straddles that moment of time when we forevermore separated the old from the new and claimed the heavens as our own. Laconic, enigmatic and courageous, Jim Harrison rubs elbows with the legends of American lore \u2013 Chuck Yeager, John Glenn, Gus Grissom Deke Slayton, Jim Lovell. Yet while he\u2019s being tested as a pilot, he also faces a devastating test at home. He and his wife Grace face a heartbreaking trauma and Harrison\u2019s trademark saying, \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily make it so.What\u2019s so incredible is that the author, Benjamin Johncock, is not an American, but a Brit. And, this is his debut novel. Yet somehow, some way, he gets it all so right. The dialogue is pitch perfect, aptly described as desert-dry, with not one note out of place. A paean to a time when Americans were inspired to reach the heavens, it captures the nostalgia while at the same time not denying that real lives diverged from the public relations narrative. It has been awhile since I read a 300 page book in 24 hours because I just couldn\u2019t stop. This is a wonderful homage to an astronaut (translated as \u201cstar voyagers\u201d) who single-mindedly pursues his dreams while striving to fight one\u2019s worst nightmare."}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "Admittedly I\u2019m struggling a little with this review because this book was as near perfect as it\u2019s possible to be when it comes to genius storytelling, emotionally resonant use of language and the ability to get you right in the heart.Set against the backdrop of the space race, in a bubble of time and place that the author brings utterly vividly to life, The Last Pilot is a character drama that deals with themes of love, loss and family that will speak to each different reader in it\u2019s own way. A truly gifted blend of history and fiction, the sheer exhileration of those in the programme, offset against the life of one family in the public spotlight means that The Last Pilot will stay with you forever.I really did love everything about this \u2013 Benjamin Johncock writes with a truly unique and gripping style, there is a quiet passion to the prose that just gathers you into the moment and wraps you up in the feel of it. The characters are inspired, all of them, but I will truly hold onto Jim, Grace and Florence for a long long time and I\u2019m positive that this is a book I shall return to again and again.The hook may well be in the wonderful interpretation of an era gone by, a time when humanity was attempting to spread its wings \u2013 that in and of itself would have made for a fascinating novel. But the heart of it is in the people, their daily struggles, the authenticity of a life less ordinary within an ordinary life \u2013 there is where this story shines like a beacon, a very special once in a lifetime read that I truly cannot recommend highly enough.That\u2019s all she wrote."}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review. Many thanks to Picador for making it available!In \nThe Last Pilot\n, Benjamin Johncock brings a true-to-life, \"you are there\" feeling to the fictionalized story of Jim Harrison, a test pilot for the U.S. Air Force, who in the late 1940s and 1950s was one of the elite few attempting to break the sound barrier. It was a dangerous task, one that led to countless pilot deaths and injuries, but the risk was worth the potential reward.Harrison and his wife Grace live in the middle of the Mojave Desert along with the other pilots risking their lives for this achievement. And if the worry over the potential harm that could come to Jim wasn't enough, the couple is struggling with fertility issues, although they want so desperately to have a baby. And when Grace miraculously becomes pregnant, Jim puts aside the chance to become one of the nation's first astronauts so he can help raise the couple's daughter, Florence.When tragedy strikes, Jim must decide whether to pursue the opportunity to join the Space Race, or wallow in the sadness and guilt that threaten to envelop him. But although he has shown tremendous bravery and fortitude in the face of amazing risk and danger, he is utterly unprepared for how hiding his pain may come to haunt him, not to mention the effect a life in the public spotlight will have on his marriage.Jim appears alongside such real-life astronauts as John Glenn, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Jim Lovell, Chuck Yeager, and Deke Slayton, but his inclusion in their story never seems false. This is a tremendously well-researched and interesting look at the U.S. in the midst of the Space Race, and how the astronauts dealt with all they faced. But beyond that, this is a book about how dangerous unacknowledged feelings of guilt can be, and the harm that comes from the things that remain unsaid. It's a powerful look at grief and loss, and the need to come to terms with one's feelings.If you're interested in the early days of the Space Race and never tire of movies like \nThe Right Stuff\n and \nApollo 13\n, this might be a book for you. Johncock goes into immense detail to provide context, but even while he's immersing you in facts, he's also capturing emotions as accurately. Maybe it was all of the detail that numbed this book's appeal for me; while I thought it was well-written, it just didn't grab me as I had hoped it might, but I've seen many other 4- and 5-star reviews, so it might just be me.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo...."}, {"userName": "Imi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3126915-imi", "userReview": "This was a great idea: a test pilot, training to be one of the original NASA astronauts, struggles with personal problems after a family tragedy.

The writing style was sparse and lifeless, which I think is the main reason I felt completely disconnected from the characters.

However, what makes this book utterly compelling and emotionally acute is a story of one family\u2014(fictional) test pilot Jim Harrison, and his wife, Grace. They live in the high desert of The Mojave Desert, in Muroc, \u201cthe largest slab of uninterrupted flatness on Earth.\u201d It\u2019s a wide expanse of nothingness, but they love calling it home. This is where their friends live, and their life is built. The story begins in media res, demanding that the reader focus intently.I was glad that I didn\u2019t know much about the book, and I waited to read the cover flap until after I finished the last page. Discovery and pacing are intricately tied to the suspense, and going into it blind rouses intensity for the reader. I\u2019m going to avoid talking about much content and primarily share impressions. Jim Harrison is fearless, instinctive, brave, and equipped to handle all the dangers of his job; each day he flies, he confronts mortal hazards. But what happens when he can\u2019t confront the pitfalls in his personal life? He is unafraid in the skies but timorous on the ground. How does this dissonance play out in a marriage? Grace is supportive and forbearing, and, at times, emotionally fragile. Empathy for both characters ripples from the narrative. The dialogue between them (and other characters) is superlative, without any clich\u00e9s often present in a dialogue-heavy book. There are no quotation marks\u2014the aesthetics are twofold--which in this book works well, as it generates intimacy, underscores the understated, and prevents messy-looking type.In a lesser author, the sections of physics, engineering, plane and rocket-craft would cause me to glaze over, and unhinge me from the story at hand. However, from Johncock, it lends a cred to the story without adding pretense. He ties in celebrated figures of the space program\u2014Jim Lovell, John Glenn, Chuck Yeager, and many more, and the Happy Bottom Riders Club bar and legendary owner, Pancho Barnes, a tenderly mouthy and accomplished pilot in her own right. And this is the time in history that the race for space heralded operatic platitudes: \u201cIt\u2019s a battle for the heavens. It\u2019s good versus evil and we\u2019re on the front line.\u201d That was how it was then. However, it\u2019s Jim\u2019s family story that provides the aching nuance, often words as weapons, or talk left unsaid, a Cold War on a microcosmic level.My only complaint is the brisk ending, or it seemed that way after the sustained mental and emotional weight of the story.

If I allowed myself small points of criticism, I would say that it\u2019s a challenge to accept the passage of time in the final 50 pages, and that a keen interest in astronauts is probably a boon to keep readers going through the test flight portions, which to me were less compelling than the domestic drama of Jim, Grace and Florence.See my full review at The Bookbag."}, {"userName": "Jaclyn Day", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1373260-jaclyn-day", "userReview": "This book hit me hard in the gut.

The Last Pilot by Benjamin Johncock is the third debut novel by a British writer that I have read in recent weeks. All have been quite excellent\u2026 First was The Killing of Bobbi Lomax by Cal Moriarty, then came White Crocodile by K T Medina \u2013 and now, The Last Pilot. Two of the three (The Killing of Bobbi Lomax and The Last Pilot) are set in the States, and written with an authentic American feel. White Crocodile is set in Cambodia.The Last Pilot is a very comprehensive and tightly written first novel. It starts in the Mojave Desert in the 1940s when a group of US test pilots are trying to break the sound barrier. Jim Harrison is one of the group. They are a hard drinking and hard living bunch (nothing wrong with a couple of stiffeners before a flight\u2026). Harrison is married to Grace on whom he dotes. They eventually (after some problems) have a daughter. After a family tragedy, the story moves on to Houston in the early 1960s where Jim has become one of the select few astronauts at the beginning of the US space programme. He and Grace live in a \u2018village\u2019 alongside the Glenns, the Lovells, and the Bormans\u2026 It is a strange existence, Kennedy has committed to having a man on the moon by 1970, and that is the absolute focus. At the same time, though, the families have all become media celebrities \u2013 with all that entails. The stress and pressure grow, both for Harrison himself and for his marriage. No spoilers, but he heads rapidly downhill\u2026 All quite believable until the slightly strained and unlikely (to my mind) denouement.The Last Pilot is a very interesting book that examines in some detail a more than significant period of recent American history. Perhaps particularly so because, although clearly a work of fiction, it is well researched (see the list of references and sources at the end\u2026) and you feel as though Harrison is actually part of the project. No doubt aided by the device of his living alongside, and being friends with, some of the real astronauts. Perhaps, though, a little worrying in that one wonders how much of the story is true and how much is fiction. I feel I could give a lecture on the early US space programme \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t be quite sure that I might not make a fool of myself!The Last Pilot is a great debut novel from a British writer who will be very well worth following.This post first appeared on our blog: http://www.tripfiction.com/novel-set-..."}, {"userName": "Ellie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3145939-ellie", "userReview": "The Last Pilot is an intimate tale of the space race told from the perspective of one man.

He starts out as a US Air Force test pilot for rocket powered planes, attempting to break the sound barrier, and is a favourite to fly the X-15 when the temptation of space beckons.

After struggling for years to have children, Jim and his wife Grace are thrilled by the birth of their daughter and happily embrace the changes she brings to their lives. But just as the Space Race begins and the country turns its attention to pilots like Jim, a tragedy strikes the Harrison family and drastically alters the future course.\"You know, she said, we went to this party, the year before, I think, old friend of mine; she'd moved east, New York, after the war. She was a journalist, worked at Time and a bunch of other places, then managed to get a job copywriting for one of those big advertising agencies on Madison Avenue. She spent the whole evening telling me how ruthless it was, how cutthroat and dog-eat-dog. I asked her how many of those men would still go into a meeting if there was a one-in-four-chance of them not making it out alive. We lost sixty-two men over a thirty-six-week stretch once. That's nearly two a week. I had to buy another black dress; I couldn't get the one I had clean and dried in time. So I had two, on rotation.\"It sounds like a straightforward, even familiar story, but The Last Pilot has incredible surprises hiding between its pages. In the middle of a testosterone-fueled desert, Johncock brings several extremely real, multi-dimensional female characters to life, though they could have easily been pushed aside to make room for another famous pilot. Along with Grace, we meet Pancho Barnes, a fiercely plucky pilot and bar owner with a wicked mouth who isn't afraid to show love when it's most needed. Even the Harrison's daughter, Florence, is a little fireball of precocious energy with a sweet, curious spirit.And we come to know these characters not in pages-long descriptions, but through conversations and even the silences between them. The absence of quotation marks takes adjusting, but the stylistic choice makes sense in a dialogue-heavy novel. Johncock's words soon play out like the script for a film so deftly written that the expressions of actors seem unnecessary. The Last Pilot will certainly be compared to books like The Right Stuff, which is one of several titles listed as a resource, but despite Johncock's incredible research, this is not a book about the Space Race or even the pilots themselves. It's a story about love and loss, and the all-consuming fears capable of changing our lives.More at rivercityreading.com"}, {"userName": "LB", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18156604-lb", "userReview": "2.5 / 5 stars ratingThis review is also posted at http://readingnookandcranny.blogspot....Where are all the quotation marks in this novel??? It feels likes a punctuation thief slid in though the sliding glass door in the middle of the night, black ski mask and all, and robbed all the dialogue in this novel of its quotation marks while the editor slept. I don't know if this is a new fad that's developing or what, but it did not work well for this novel. For one, it made it impossible to speed read, and a few sections of this novel I could have definitely speed read through. To try to make it less difficult to tell who the heck is talking or if anyone is talking at all, Johncock decides to use the word \"said\" is annoying abundance. Throughout the novel, I am constantly reading \u201cJim said\u201d or \u201cGrace said\u201d or \u201cJohn said\u201d. You know, if you used quotation marks, you wouldn't need the incessant use of this verb. At least throw some synanoms in every once in a while man to change it up.But I digress.I went into this novel thinking it was going to be a balls to the walls tale about a test pilot who also has to deal with issues at home. I thought it was going to be a tale about test pilots and astronauts at the birth of the space race, and a story about how astronauts are humans too, with families and problems of their own. As a lover of space exploration, this type of plot immediately draws my attention. At even the mention of the first astronauts, I was searching my country's library catalog and requesting a copy. I probably should of read a little more into the synopsis.Instead of an action packed adventure with a side of family drama, the flying and the space race are more of a backdrop to the story of Jim, Grace, and Duck. And yes, it is a heartwarming and also sad story, but it isn't strong enough to carry this story in the end. The characters are interesting enough (except Grace who is basically there as a wife/mother figure and for absolutely nothing else), but this book reads more like a boring biography than anything else. Perhaps I had unrealistic expectations for this story, but I am definitely walking away disappointed."}, {"userName": "Ti", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122928-ti", "userReview": "The Short of It:Amid the excitement of space exploration, one couple is forced to deal with a horrible tragedy and the aftermath that it leaves behind.The Rest of It:The story centers around Jim Harrison and his wife Grace. Jim is an Air Force test pilot in Muroc, California on a base which later becomes Edwards Air Force Base. He\u2019s a member of the New Nine, which is the first group to fly manned missions to space. As you can imagine, this is a very exciting time for them all.Grace is not your typical Air Force wife. She worries, but she seems to know deep down, that things will turn out okay. But things are not okay. Jim and Grace suffer a terrible tragedy and it\u2019s threatening to tear them apart. Grace desperately needs Jim during this time, but Jim chooses to bury himself in work. How can you help another person when your own grief is too heavy to bear?I really liked this novel. The excitement of space exploration is what grabbed my attention initially, but this couple\u2019s situation really stayed with me. Not to mention the casual mentions of real-life astronaut Jim Lovell and larger-than-life Pancho Barnes. Barnes, who seriously steals the show in this one, could be the subject of her own book. She runs a bar, flies an airplane and basically knows everyone and better yet, seems to know exactly what everyone needs.This knack of hers comes in handy more than once.This was a smooth read for me. Even without the use of quotation marks, the writing and dialogue flowed effortlessly. Yes, there might have been a little confusion on my part when more than one character had the same name (two Jims, two Graces) but I quickly figured out who was who.Overall, I really enjoyed this debut from Benjamin Johncock and I would absolutely read his work again.

This book confirmed my admiration of both.Benjamin Johncock's debut novel is as informative and well-researched as it is heartrending and devastating. It is equal parts big-picture history and granular family-in-the-midst-of-turmoil. Juxtaposing the excitement and terror of the beginning of the space race with the singular, exquisite experience of becoming parents and raising a child, Johnson powerfully evokes that particular period, the 1950s and 1960s, and allows the reader to view those years through the eyes of a man who is both extraordinary and yet terrifyingly mortal. It is beautifully paced, and the writing is spare and clean, much like the mind of the protagonist, Jim, and his home in the Mojave.My major gripe was with the dialogue -- the punctuation made it difficult for me, but it was a problem that was relatively easily overcome with attention.HIghly recommend, and I anxiously await more from this fresh, new voice."}, {"userName": "saizine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4894611-saizine", "userReview": "Evocative (especially of the Mojave) and sparse prose, directly contrasted with a plot that might be considered just on the wrong side of sentimental.

The depictions of panic and compulsion felt very real, as did each of the characters.

On the screen was the surface of the moon.\"Jim Harrison is a test pilot in the United States Air Force, one of the exalted few. He spends his days cheating death in the skies above the Mojave Desert and his nights at his friend Pancho's bar, often with his wife, Grace. She and Harrison are secretly desperate for a child-and when, against all odds, Grace learns that she is pregnant, the two are overcome with joy.While America becomes swept up in the fervor of the Space Race, Harrison turns his attention home, passing up the chance to become an astronaut to welcome his daughter, Florence, into the world. Together, he and Grace confront the thrills and challenges of raising a child head-on. Fatherhood is different than flying planes-less controlled, more anxious-however the pleasures of watching Florence grow are incomparable. But when his family is faced with a sudden and inexplicable tragedy, Harrison's instincts as a father and a pilot are put to test. As a pilot, he feels compelled to lead them through it-and as a father, he fears that he has fallen short.The aftermath will haunt the Harrisons and strain their marriage as Jim struggles under the weight of his decisions. Beginning when the dust of the Second World War has only just begun to settle and rushing onward into the Sixties, Benjamin Johncock traces the path of this young couple as they are uprooted by events much larger than themselves. The turns the Harrisons take together are at once astonishing and recognizable; their journey, both frightening and full of hope. Set against the backdrop of one of the most emotionally charged periods in American history, The Last Pilot is a mesmerizing debut novel of loss and finding courage in the face of it from an extraordinary new talent.", "title": "The Last Pilot", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22857253-the-last-pilot", "average": 3.64, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1430317694l/22857253.jpg", "reviews": 211, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5835427.Benjamin_Johncock", "name": "Benjamin Johncock"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Historical", "Space", "Abandoned"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22857253-the-last-pilot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25841565-the-last-pilot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25686930-the-last-pilot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36404662-last-pilot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13648341-the-maginot-line", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
