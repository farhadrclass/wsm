I loved the beautiful prose, the gradually increasing sense of menace and tension, the examination of how a woman's identity and sense of self can be utterly subsumed by motherhood. Then I finished it.I believe the words that came out of my mouth were something approximating the phrase ARE YOU XXXXING KIDDING ME????!!!Seriously, seriously, the most ridiculous motive and the most 'ran out of ideas' ending I have had the misfortune to read in many years (and my readers will know that I myself am no stranger to writing a crap ending!).

We've come across this technique before. Well, here it is again.The atmosphere of baleful self-loathing in this novel is as thick as cake mix. The young mother Emma is being eaten alive by her baby and three year old. There is no joy to be had anywhere for Emma. The kids are perfectly normal, as is the husband, but poor Emma is standing on tiptoe with the waters of quiet hysteria rising to within an inch of her nose. So her story is claustrophobically unhappy. Nina, the other half of the story, is well-off London chicness itself but she appears to be insinuating herself into Emma\u2019s life with the purpose of doing some terrible harm, for 200 pages, so that gives you the creeps, it\u2019s all a bit Hand That Rocks the Cradle. For 50 pages or so it\u2019s okay, the dread slowly builds up. But man, we have to wait. And wait. And then in the end, pffffft. Come on Harriet, we\u2019ve all seen Fatal Attraction, the phrase \u201cshe\u2019s a bunny boiler\u201d has passed into the national consciousness. You have to crank it up a little more than this.Also I didn\u2019t buy the whole revenge plot motivation. It was as thin as a catwalk model. I got that feeling I often get when I (mostly ill-advisedly) read thrillers, that people don\u2019t really behave like this in real life, it's all too psychologically pat. Oh, also, the style of this book became painful after a while. Every dad-blamed thing in these women\u2019s lives gets noticed, every single solitary item middle-class British women have in their houses gets a name-check, and absolutely everything gets an appropriate adjective applied.

I was excited when it came in, but I made the mistake of looking at the Goodreads reviews before I started it. Wow. A 2.9???? I don't think I have ever read a book rated that low on Goodreads. I was disappointed and put it aside for a while, but curiosity got the better of me and I picked it up again and gave it a shot - and am I glad I did! I loved it!This was a cleverly crafted and beautifully written psychological study of two women, who tell their stories in alternating chapters over the course of a year or so. Emma is an overwhelmed mom with a toddler and an infant. She is faintly resentful of her husband and children and their domestic tyrannies, misses her career and feels she has lost herself. Nina is a composed and successful painter in a second marriage with a teen-aged daughter. It's made perfectly clear from page one that Nina knows and is in fact obsessed with Emma, but we don't know why. And Emma is drawn to Nina but clearly doesn\u2019t know or remember her. What happened in the past that is driving Nina\u2019s increasingly unhealthy preoccupation with Emma? Better question \u2013 WHO CARES? This is where I see this book differently than many reviewers. I don\u2019t see this as a thriller with an insufficient payoff at the end \u2013 I see this as a gripping study of two women who are unraveling in different but equally interesting ways. I couldn\u2019t look away. As for the end\u2026..I\u2019ve seen different and strange interpretations. All I can say is \u2013 if you\u2019re not sure what happened there, carefully re-read the last chapters Nina and Emma narrate.

Here's my honest review. I was loving this book... until the 2 last chapters came along. They ruined the whole experience for me. The second to last chapter we finally discovered how Nina knew Emma. How come Emma doesn't remember Nina? and Nina's motive is just plain ridiculous. She didn't seem crazy in any other aspect of her life, so why is she so mad at Emma??? I just didn't get it. And the last chapter... What can I say... I hated the ending. And I usually like when the ending is not really an ending and you have to try and figure it out for yourself.

Not with regards to specific plot points, just general developments, but you may want to avoid reading it in full if you are planning to read the book and want to be surprised.)Her is the second novel from Harriet Lane, author of the wonderful Alys, Always. It is the tale of two women, Nina and Emma, who tell their own stories in alternating chapters. When the characters meet - or, more accurately, when Nina sees Emma in the street - there is an instant flare of horror, panic and fascination on Nina's side. Straight away it is clear that the characters have encountered one another before, and that whatever interaction they have had, it has left a mark on Nina - but not on Emma, who fails to recognise Nina. The plot presents an immediate, obvious mystery: what can possibly have happened between the two women to make Nina obsessed with Emma, while Emma doesn't remember Nina at all? After a period of contemplation - 'I'm scared of seeing her, and I'm scared that I'll never see her again' - Nina finds a way to initiate contact with Emma, and strikes up something Emma sees as a new friendship, but Nina (and the reader) knows to be a deliberate and carefully plotted campaign to insinuate herself into Emma's life. For her part, Emma is quickly taken in by Nina, the kind of cool, calm and collected woman she wishes she could be. Emma is an immediately likeable character, the sort of person everybody knows multiple versions of in real life, friendly and rather unremarkable, nice but (on the surface) altogether ordinary. She is clearly on the very-privileged side of privileged, but struggling in a number of ways, and has none of Nina's composure. Although she loves her children, motherhood has not been what she hoped (and I have to say, if I wasn't already horrified by the idea of having kids, I probably would be after reading this). Emma is always tired and unkempt, is jealous of her husband's ability to continue with his career unaffected, and feels lonely, distanced from both the world of work and any sort of social life. Her emotions towards both her husband and her children switch between love and resentment, and overall, her existence is one of exhaustion and perpetual dissatisfaction. Emma resembles the 'put-upon young mother' stereotype so common in popular contemporary fiction, but here the well-worn caricature is fleshed out into something that actually resembles a real person, someone you can understand, relate to and believe in.Nina is altogether more complex and difficult. In Nina, we have someone who perhaps resembles Frances of Alys, Always a decade or more into her social-climbing project. She is the daughter of a successful composer, but often hints at a difficult childhood: her father a philanderer, her mother eccentric and with a tendency towards alcoholism. She is sleek, sophisticated and glamorous, and everything (or almost everything) in her life is beautifully ordered and controlled. Nina has a teenage daughter, distant and pretty, and is married to her second husband, a quiet, unobtrusive presence in her life. When she speaks of her first husband, Arnold, it is often with the language of gratitude:\nSometimes it felt as if Arnold, with his confidence and generosity and taste, had willed me into existence, suggesting as much as fostering the characteristics which are now so much a part of me. He turned my shyness into reserve, my guardedness into self-possession. He brought me out of the shadows. All this talk of 'finding yourself': often, other people show you yourself first.\nIf Arnold was Nina's ticket to the life, and the self, she craved, he has long since been discarded; tellingly, 'he knew too much. He'd seen both sides.' Nina is an artist, but it seems as though she has enough money to stop working, should she want to. There is clearly no financial or social motivation for her pursuit of a friendship with Emma. Nina often alludes to the idea that Emma was once 'perfect' and has somehow fallen from grace - something she regards with both delight and disgust. Every aspect of Emma's life provokes an obsessive instinct in Nina, and there is a manipulative cruelty to the way she pursues her quarry with small, insidious acts, but this preoccupation with Emma is one of the only things that rattles Nina and therefore one of the only things that humanises her. In the opening pages, her feelings upon sighting Emma are 'overwhelmingly powerful: like panic, or passion.' It's these cracks in the armour, these glimpses of vulnerability that make you desperate to get under the skin of the character. I've read some reviews of Alys, Always that criticised it for being a psychological thriller that wasn't thrilling enough. I don't agree with this assessment at all, not least because I don't think Alys, Always actually is a psychological thriller, and also because that absolutely isn't the point of the story, but anyway. My point in mentioning it is that I am sure that those readers will feel the same about Her, which has also been positioned as a thriller: when the Big Reveal of the Big Twist comes, the moment the whole book has been working up to, it isn't anything much at all. Does this mean it's disappointing? Not at all - quite the opposite, in my opinion. The fact that the root of all this is such a tiny thing, and something entirely beyond Emma's control or even knowledge, makes it all the more delicious, strange and unnerving. It also suddenly tilts the character of Nina entirely and makes her seem much more unhinged than the reader may have previously supposed. This sets the tone for a dramatic cliffhanger ending which leaves the characters' fate, and the aftermath of these climactic events, open to the reader's interpretation. It takes a special kind of talent to replace an expected big revelation with a small, unremarkable one and still make this feel as big and meaningful as the most lurid of twists. In fact, examined more closely, the book is full of moments like this. For example, it is frequently implied that Nina is flirting with Ben, Emma's husband, and you wonder if she is going to try and seduce him - it seems as if it would be easy - but nothing Nina does is that obvious. This is a book of subtleties. In fact, Nina herself spells out the truth of her tale. After speaking to Ben about a book he's reading, she observes:\nI don't say that I've read it and enjoyed it, though I found the final plot twist unsatisfying, as plot twists often are: nothing like life, which - it seems to me - turns less on shocks or theatrics than on the small quiet moments, misunderstandings or disappointments, the things that it's easy to overlook.\nAnd then, deliciously:\n'I don't think I like these characters,' he's saying: an annoying remark, one with which I can't be bothered to engage.\nI didn't find Her to be as immediate or as continually gripping as Alys, Always, but after finishing it, I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks. It took me a while to get round to writing this review but, once I started re-looking at the book to jog my memory, I found that I really wanted to read it again. Her doesn't grab you by the collar and refuse to let go: it creeps up on you and worms its way into your head until it feels like a part of your reality. Nina and Emma are so fully-formed and well-realised that I find it almost impossible to believe they aren't out there somewhere, living these lives. This is a tightly plotted novel that is taut with suspense but, more than that, it is a wonderfully intricate, rewarding character study that demands to be re-read and savoured."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "Buggering Book-selling Blurbs\nMost of the Novel Moves Like a Mini through Mississippi Mud BottomI fell for laudatory plugs for this novel from other authors, words I casually glanced over in the bookstore.

As the reader you can\u2019t help but wonder why Nina is so obsessed with Emma especially as Emma doesn\u2019t appear to recognise her at all when they first meet. What connects these two women and why Nina wants to insert herself into her life is the crux of the whole book.We have Nina and her poised life as an artist, mother of the teenage Sophie and partner to the almost detached Charles provides a stark contrast with Emma the mother of two-year old Christopher mired in domesticity wondering where her \u2018true\u2019 self has gone since marriage and motherhood. Emma is clearly overwhelmed, pregnant and frazzled when Nina inserts herself into her life and with precision finds the weak spots in Emma\u2019s life and exploits them with precise cruelty. The casual way she hurts Emma while pretending to be her friend is in many ways more shocking than any open hostility could ever be.Harriet Lane cleverly tells the story from both women\u2019s viewpoints by overlapping the narrative thereby dragging the story back to a specific point before moving it forward from the differing perspectives as Nina and Emma narrate alternate chapters. The writing is understated and all the more chilling because of it but the prose still manages to conjure up scenes in London and France without ever seeming mired in detail. This is a relatively short book with 235 pages of intrigue, frankly bizarre behaviour and undisclosed secrets from the past, well until the end which says just enough to allow the reader time to reflect.

In fact, I'm hesitant to even officially call either of them thrillers due to their subtlety, but Her especially has such an underlying feel of menace that it just has to fall into the category.Instead of the marriage dramas that have been popping up everywhere since Gone Girl exploded, Lane tackles female friendship. Nina, a chic, poised, and fairly successful painter with an older husband and a mystifying teenaged daughter, has turned the lack of confidence she suffered in her early years into a quiet self-possession, appearing calm, cool and collected at all times. Emma is a harried new mother, struggling to keep herself together and stifled by domesticity with a toddler and a newborn, and a kind but slightly clueless husband. Nina spots Emma randomly on the street one day and it's obvious that she recognizes her, but the specifics are not explained - it's soon revealed that Emma has no idea who Nina is, and Nina goes to great lengths (including a few particularly nefarious schemes) to insinuate herself into Nina's life. Nina is drawn to Emma, but at the same time is determined to avenge something from their shared past. Some reviewers have noted that they were irritated by the narrative style, which alternates between Nina and Emma's point of view and therefore is constantly rehashing the same events, but I found it fascinating. What seems like a totally normal or random occurrence on Emma's end is re-told in Nina's perspective and changes completely, into something manipulated and sinister.Lane also makes some very interesting choices in terms of the story - the \"twist\" is really nothing huge or shocking, a parallel to a discussion Nina has about a plot twist in a drugstore novel, and how reality operates \"less on shocks or theatrics than on the small, quiet moments, misunderstandings or disappointments, the things that it's easy to overlook.\" The ending is also completely open-ended and all the more chilling for it. All in all, Her is a kind of funny little book - I whipped through it pretty quickly as it's very compact, and I enjoyed it without being overly impressed, but when I was finished it I thought about it for some time after and realized how much more affecting it was than I had realized."}, {"userName": "Deborah Markus", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/954028-deborah-markus", "userReview": "Hmmm.This book was beautifully written and masterfully creepy.

This is an extremely quiet thriller. There is a suspenseful story-line that meanders through this split-perspective story. There are no scenes of extreme excitement or high-stakes action. There is interest created, as to why the characters are behaving as they currently are, but the intrigue never reaches heart-palpitating levels. And instead of steadily rising to this point, the ending remains almost as quiet as the bulk of it.I initially closed this feeling a little cheated from my desired, dramatic ending, but then one particular quite kept replaying in my mind. This quote concerned a thriller novel, one of the characters was reading:\"I found the final plot twist unsatisfying, as plot twists often are: nothing like life, which - it seems to me - turns less on shock or theatrics than on the small quiet moments, misunderstandings or disappointments, the things that it's easy to overlook.\"Could Lane's quote be cunningly referring to her own book??I have a feeling she has constructed something entirely new, in the thriller genre. Newer releases tend to have to provide an ever increasing amount of shock-factor to compete with its peers. This novel takes a step back and, instead, provides us with a slice of reality. There is still intrigue, but it is at a believable level, and it also creates the shocking conclusion that this could very easily happen in the reader's own life. It may even be happening right now...I am still not entirely sure how I feel about this novel, weeks after I have read it, but my thoughts continuously cycle to all the possibilities, proposed here.

It is, nevertheless, an edge-of-the-seat page-turner and a sharp examination of the almost-invisible and subtle---yet vicious---misogyny that some women exhibit toward other women.My wife calls it \u201cGirl Code\u201d. She acknowledges that most, if not all, men have no clue about its existence, and those that do are mentally incapable of breaking the code. I can\u2019t speak for all men, but I can say, for me, she\u2019s absolutely right. I was unaware of its existence until I married her, at which point she explained it to me, as best she could. It made complete sense, and it helped to explain a lifetime of utter confusion and lack of comprehension I had regarding female behavior and the complexities of relationships between women. Of course, I still don\u2019t know what the fuck is actually being communicated when two women are speaking in girl code, and I\u2019ve pretty much accepted the fact that I never will, but I can now, at least, recognize when girl code is being used in front of me.To explain, \u201cGirl Code\u201d is a secret language comprised almost entirely of non-verbal cues, deceptive statements, awkward silences, and passive-aggressive behavior that exists only between women. (Not that men can\u2019t also be the brunt of girl code, but most men simply brush it off and chalk it up to \u201cweird, fucked up chick\u201d behavior, which tends to lose its intended sting. It is, according to my wife, almost always a \u201cgirl thing\u201d.) It is almost always used in a negative way, to express anger, petty jealousy, displeasure, hatred, or, in extreme cases, revenge. There have been many books written---most of them just within the past 20 years---that help to explain this silent aggression that exists between girls and women. It is essentially a form of bullying, only one that is, more often than not, hard to detect and indistinguishable from bullying, primarily because it does not manifest itself in the same way that traditional bullying plays out, which usually involves physical violence, blatant name-calling, and/or degradation. Female bullying utilizes girl code in different ways---silent treatment, emotional and mental violence, and public humiliation---to prove a point to another girl, one that has been targeted for whatever reason. Sometimes, there is no reason at all.The phenomenon of female bullying is not new, but the acknowledgement of its existence is. Indeed, some psychologists still believe that it doesn\u2019t exist, that what some call female bullying is simply normal female behavior, a school of thought that I personally find misogynistic in itself. It\u2019s akin to saying that boys who are caught in a gang rape of a drunken college girl are simply \u201cboys being boys\u201d, as if that deplorable behavior is acceptable in any way.There has been a recent spate of novels and films that depict this kind of awful behavior between women, most notably the novels of Gillian Flynn. In her book, \u201cSharp Objects\u201d, she destroys the traditional notion that all women are naturally good mothers. That book plays out like \u201cMean Girls\u201d if the mean girls were properly trained by Hannibal Lector.Her best-selling novel \u201cGone Girl\u201d, however, is an example of female bullying at its extreme. It exemplifies how far girl code can be taken. In that novel, the antiheroine\u2019s dim-witted douchebag of a husband finds himself the direct victim of girl code. It is his inability to break the code, \u201cread the signs\u201d, or communicate with his wife at all that inevitably leads to his doom, but it is the antiheroine\u2019s brilliant use of girl code that manipulates and deceives the general public to the point where she literally gets away with murder.Lane\u2019s novel \u201cHer\u201d isn\u2019t nearly as twisty, elaborate, or violent as \u201cGone Girl\u201d. Indeed, Lane\u2019s British tea-party stylings are almost tepid in comparison to Flynn\u2019s punk rock sensibilities, but, strangely enough, Lane is attempting to do something similar to Flynn in \u201cHer\u201d.In \u201cHer\u201d, two women meet under unusual circumstances. They are both suburban housewives, but that is where their similarities end. Emma is a harried stay-at-home mother of two young children, who secretly misses her days of working a boring 9-to-5 office job, hates herself for sometimes resenting her children, and struggles to pay bills and buy groceries on the measly income of her clueless, but sweet, husband. Nina is an artist whose paintings bring in a steady stream of money to add to her husband\u2019s rather large income, which enables them to live a wealthy lifestyle of fancy catered dinner parties and nights at the opera, and she has accepted her husband\u2019s indifference and her teenaged daughter\u2019s coldness, mainly because she doesn\u2019t really care. She\u2019s bored despite the fact that she seemingly has everything she wants or needs.When they strike up an unlikely friendship, at first it seems based on a need for female companionship, a camaraderie borne out of motherhood and bored housewife syndrome.Nina, however, has an ulterior motive, one that is unclear, perhaps even to herself. She recognizes Emma from her childhood. Whether she actually recognizes Emma, herself, or something in Emma that reminds her of another person doesn\u2019t seem to matter. Things have been set in motion. Nina has some kind of wicked plan in mind, and Emma has no clue that Nina is being nice to her in order to butter her up for something.Very little action happens in \u201cHer\u201d. Other than the very detailed description of the minutiae of housework and child-rearing, what Nina, at one point, calls \u201cThe tyranny of domesticity\u201d---the boredom of sitting at home catching snatches of daytime soap operas and game shows when the children go down for naps, excursions to the grocery store and walks in the park, an occasional evening out, a failed dinner party, and a family vacation---most of the real action in the story is cerebral. It is in the inner monologues of the two women---one dreaming, the other scheming. Despite the whole lot of nothing that actually happens in the book, there is something terrifying and riveting going on here, so much so that I had a hard time putting the book down. I wanted to finish it in one sitting, simply because I didn\u2019t know what the fuck was going to happen, but things were definitely building to a head. When the ending does come, it is just as horrific and awful as I secretly came to expect and hoped wouldn\u2019t.About the ending: some may feel that it\u2019s a cop-out ending, not a real ending at all, with no closure. Maybe. It\u2019s frustrating, to be sure, and it\u2019s horrible, but I wouldn\u2019t call it a cop-out. It\u2019s simply an ending that one could see coming early on and prayed that divine intervention would prevent.I liked \u201cHer\u201d, but I hated it as well. I can\u2019t really recommend the book, as I think it is truly horrible in the sense that a hurricane or a pandemic is horrible, but it does make me wonder how often shit like this goes on in the world, and in the minds of spiteful, misogynistic women."}, {"userName": "\u2740Julie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7425446-julie", "userReview": "[ It wasn\u2019t even the ambiguity or abruptness that bothered me (although I did mutter \u201cwhat?!\u201d as I turned the final page on my kindle\u2026) so much as the sickening way it ended..

We get perspectives from both Emma and Nina, throughout the novel. Very early on, we start to understand that something links these two women, artist and mother from the past. Nina wants revenge and slowly she starts to disrupt Emma\u2019s world.I found this book incredibly hard to get through and extremely dull. I actually gave up reading at 60%. Getting the same scene narrated by both characters just reinforced my sense of boredom. I disliked both characters and found myself not caring what might happen next. The pace was just too slow. Half way through the book, I would have expected to have had more of an idea of the direction of the plot. But very little had happened at that point. Nina was supposed to be unhinged and obsessed.

I haven't read Harriet Lane before so I had no expectations going into reading this. It's a psychological suspense between two women that kept me turning the pages.

Yes, because of this most points of the story were re-hashed but it made you see their story differently.

There is absolutely no reason Nina would hate Emma and no reason to suspect that Nina is actually crazy, which she would have to be to blow up this non-event into a reason for a campaign of revenge against Emma some 15 or 20 years later.

In alternating, overlapping chapters that relate different events from each woman's perspective, you watch as the two form a tenuous and unexpected relationship though it is absolutely clear that while Emma sees Nina as a friend, Nina is looking for revenge.

Nina is a successful artist, and she lives with her older husband and with Sophie, the 17-year-old daughter of an early, failed marriage. She is independent \u2013 her husband\u2019s successful career as an architect means that he is often away \u2013 she is poised, and she enjoys the fruits of her success.Emma is the stay-at-home mother of a toddler and a newborn baby. It wasn\u2019t practical for her to pick up the threads of her freelance career. They were a happy family, but sometimes Emma missed the woman she used to be.When they crossed paths Nina recognised Emma, from years ago, but Emma didn\u2019t recognise Nina.Nina found and returns the purse that Emma apparently lost during a trip to the shops, and then there was another occasion for her to step in, with charm and diplomacy, to save the day. And another.Emma was so pleased to have such a friend, a friend who understood what she was had to cope with from day to day, and a friend who understood that she was more than a wife and mother. But she didn\u2019t see how very brittle Nina was, and she didn\u2019t know that her overtures of friendship were the first step towards revenge for something that happened years ago.The narration is shared between Nina and Alice, often \u2013 but not always \u2013 having each tell the same story. That shows so clearly that they see the same things very differently, and that there are many things that Emma doesn\u2019t see, that Emma misinterprets. It isn\u2019t that she\u2019s a fool; there is nothing at all to suggest that Nina\u2019s motivations are anything less that straightforward.Harriet Lane writes beautifully, catching the details of two women\u2019s lives, making her story utterly compelling, and steadily increasing the tension.It was so easy to feel for Emma. Her situation \u2013 she loved her husband, he loved her, they both loved their children, but she was losing herself as she played her role and struggled with the volume of work that involved, so often running to stand still \u2013 was so very well observed, and so very believable. And she was so vulnerable, bit she didn\u2019t know, there was no way she could have known.When Nina\u2019s motivations became clearer I questioned whether her revenge was disproportionate to her grievance. But maybe she was even more fragile that she thought, maybe she traced a great deal back to Emma all those years ago, maybe she got a little too caught up with her scheme \u2026.I had doubts, but I decided I could live with them.I could understand that she was troubled and why she was troubled, but I\u2019m inclined to think that even in other circumstances she would have been too cool, too composed, for me to feel much empathy. The tension grew as the end of the story drew nearer.The denouement was mundane, the writing was understated but the consequences were clear. I caught my breath.The story had been so clever, so quietly compelling, so horribly believable, and now it was over."}, {"userName": "Siskiyou-Suzy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5922796-siskiyou-suzy", "userReview": "Do not read this book.If you started to read this book, then do not finish it. You might think you should finish it because the writing is sometimes lovely, if slow. You might assume that all that slowness will build up to something, that somebody with such nice prose would never attempt to write a thriller that seems to only address the minutiae of everyday life. You might also assume that since the author made the choice to show us nearly every scene twice (same dialogue, often the same details), she would never end the book without some sort of satisfying moment, some instance that makes all the repetition and slowness and dangling of a just-interesting-enough mysterious past worth it. You will endure so much, trusting the author that she knows what she's doing, that this is calculated and it will pay off. But there is no pay-off.

I very much enjoyed Harriet Lane's previous novel, Alys, Always, and was expecting to enjoy this one. The promised theme of a toxic friendship between two women seemed likely to suit her very subtle style of storytelling, and to have all the makings of an excellent psychological thriller. The alternating first person narrators worked well, up to a point. Although there was a lot of overlap, there was far more than that - and seeing the same scene from different points of view was very effective. It wasn't, for me, overdone to the point of boredom. My problem was more fundamental, and was with the characters and the plot. We learn early on that these two women have known each other in the past, although one remembers and the other clearly doesn't - so there's the first clue that there is some oddness about the past relationship, that made it matter so much to one character and completely pass the other one by. We also learn that Nina is now the more confident and attractive of the two, and in their youth Emma was...and that for some unspecified reason Nina still resents Emma. So much so that she pickpockets Emma's wallet and kidnaps her toddler (only for an hour but still!) in order to engineer a friendship. All this we are told through the alternating first person narratives. And so that means we are in Nina's head for half the story - and while orchestrating this elaborate revenge, she doesn't once think about the reason for it - not until near to the end of the story. And then the reason is just simply inadequate. It turns out that Nina's father had a crush on young Emma, and it was a precipitating cause of Nina's parents' divorce. But Emma was, by Nina's account, pretty much unaware and certainly not culpable. This, and her cruelty to Emma's children, is explicable if Nina is pure sociopath, but unlike the main character in Alys, apart from those isolated incidents she doesn't come across that way. She had issues with her mother and daughter and was on her second marriage, but she didn't seem to have anything other than ordinarily human virtues and vices in those relationships. So for me, it failed. I felt cheated that she'd held back on the motive - but more cheated that the motive was so flimsy. And the ending without an ending, where Nina manipulated a fatal accident for the toddler... but we didn't get to find out whether he drowned or his mother got there in time to save him.... That felt like a failure of nerve. I would have preferred Nina to relent, or to see her actually follow through. I still enjoyed her writing though, and will probably read her next novel."}, {"userName": "Karen White", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5260685-karen-white", "userReview": "This is one of those books where you can\u2019t talk about the plot without ruining the book, so I\u2019ll talk about other stuff.I\u2019ve noticed that many reviews on Goodreads have been hot and cold; this held true for our book club (which received a box full of free copies \u2013thanks to Little, Brown and Co.). I found the book to be engrossing, and as another member said, when I wasn\u2019t reading it, I was thinking about it. Lane does a great job of creating atmosphere with sensory details \u2013 I especially felt the weather and how it burdened the already over-burdened Emma, and the change sunny and warm weather brings when she and her family go on holiday in France. However, some book club members found the pace way to slow, that not enough was happening. I found the slow-but-inevitable-puzzle-coming-together nature of it compelling, found myself searching for clues as to what motivates Nina and wondering what her revenge will be. Lane does a good job of giving us just enough to go on. Nina addresses the reader as if we already know what her grievance with Emma is, so it\u2019s only the occasional specific that she let\u2019s drop which gives us a clue. (\u201cIt meant nothing to her after all\u201d (27) as if we know what she\u2019s talking about.)She does a good job of laying out two women\u2019s lives in very different places of motherhood.
