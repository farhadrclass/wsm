I switched from modern cozies and crime fiction to a supposed blast from the past. I remembered a few PD James novels I read in college as part of my mystery fiction independent studies and decided to start the series. As expected, very reminiscent of Agatha Christie but with a little more modern appeal. I enjoyed the characters and premise for a traditional whodunit!I also like the wrap up of all the main characters in the end, as well as that at least one of them is seen again in future novels (no spoilers here!).If you're a traditional mystery buff, or have an avid whodunit interest, you may be able to figure the culprit on your own, but rest assured, it's not as simple as X did it the candlestick in the library!Remember the movie Clue!!!"}, {"userName": "Shireen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4969312-shireen", "userReview": "After my brain injury, PD James became a marker for me in my reading progress. Pre-injury I read every one of her books and enjoyed them tremendously for their good writing and good stories. After my injury though, with my reading ability fried, I couldn't read any of her books. Too many characters to follow, plots that meandered beyond my ability to follow, writing at a grade level higher than what I'd sunk down to... It was rather disappointing to see her new books come out over the years and know I wouldn't read them.And then I was enrolled in a research drug trial in March. I felt my cognitive abilities shift, and I suddenly realised I was reading more. I dared to try a PD James. I followed my rehab therapists' advice: read a book I'd already read, tis easier. And so I went all the way back to James's first Dalgliesh book.It felt quite familiar.I'd begun reading PD James in my teens, an age when I still reread books (sometime in my twenties I stopped rereading them because as soon as I'd read the first paragraph, the entire book would flood back into my memory). And so I'd probably reread Cover Her Face a few times years ago. Also, the story is reminiscent of a couple of Agatha Christie mysteries (which I continued to reread after my brain injury), making the plot familiar in several ways. Even so, I did have some trouble keeping track of the characters, and I only solved the mystery near the end, which is better than my usual not-solving-the-mystery-at-all track record since the injury. But the writing was demonstrably superior to many of the books I've been reading. It was rather satisfying to sink my teeth into a book fully of layers and complexities due to the author's good command of the language.I enjoyed it immensely."}, {"userName": "Tea Jovanovi\u0107", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3103000-tea-jovanovi", "userReview": "Na\u017ealost, kod nas je bila popularnija serija snimljena po romanima o inspektori Dagli\u0161u nego sami roman P.D.

In some ways this is a very typical mystery. The Maxie family live in the big house, in somewhat genteel poverty, with the only full time staff member the loyal Martha. As well as the housework and cooking, Mr Maxie is bedridden, so Mrs Maxie employs Sally Jupp, an unmarried mother as a house-parlourmaid. She is convinced by Miss Liddell, the Warden of St Mary\u2019s Refuge for Girls, that Sally will be a hard worker, but the arrival of sly, devious and attractive Sally causes chaos within the house. On the night of the Church Fete, held at Martingale, home of the Maxie\u2019s, the young woman is killed.Enter Detective Chief-Inspector Adam Dalgliesh to investigate. We have a whole host of suspects and motives and the novel is, as you would expect, extremely well plotted. I found the way Sally Jupp was presented as both a sympathetic victim, and yet essentially a young woman that nobody seemed to like, cleverly done and there were plenty of twists and turns. This reads very much as a stand alone novel, although, as we know, Dalgleish was to become a much loved and long running character. It was a joy to embark on this series again and I look forward to reading on."}, {"userName": "Faith", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17430801-faith", "userReview": "It's been a long time since I read a book by this author, but I think I remember having liked them. Maybe the other books were better or maybe I have just outgrown my interest in mysteries, at least the British variety with tea cups, jam jars, jumble sales and small gossipy villages. Whatever the reason, I was really unimpressed by this book. Most of the suspects were introduced in tedious detail in the first chapter, but the murder did not occur until about the 25% point of the book. At that time Detective Adam Dalgliesh arrived on the scene, but he did very little \"detecting\" thereafter. He was barely in the book other than to conduct long interviews with the suspects and then, in the ultimate clich\u00e9, gather them all together in one room to declare the crime solved. The solution involved secret relatives and missing limbs. I had not guessed the criminal, so that's something in it's favor. I didn't really dislike this book, I've just moved on."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2679341-jane", "userReview": "Where I got the book: Audiobook on Audible.I thought it was about time I listened to the entire Adam Dalgleish series\u2014I\u2019ve read some of them but certainly none of the early ones. In this 1962 story you can see the tradition that goes back to the Golden Age of the detective story in the 1930s. All the clich\u00e9s are there: the stately home, the nerve-ridden war hero, the lower classes kowtowing to the upper, the vicar a sort of go-between in terms of social status. Except that it wasn\u2019t, of course\u2014James updated her stately home mystery to portray a society shaken by (another) War and by the social upheaval that followed it. The staff at Martingale is reduced to a sort of housekeeper, Martha, with no butler in sight to do the dirty deed. Martha is aided by a housemaid, Sally Jupp, an unmarried mother who seems to take lightly what would once have been a cause of shame. The lower classes are decidedly uppity, with their carefully tended council houses and a distinct touch of attitude toward their betters. The money is all gone, the master of the house is dying, and standards are always just a step away from slipping disastrously down the cliff face. And yet the Maxies struggle on, holding the village f\u00eate in their grounds, giving dinner parties and doing good wherever they can\u2014such as taking in Sally and her child, whose father is unknown.Manipulative Sally announces that she\u2019s marrying into the Maxie family, but is found dead the next morning and the chief constable calls in the Yard, in the form of Dalgleish. We learn little about the detective, who comes across as rather two-dimensional, prone to saying \u201cyes, we know all about that,\u201d when a new clue is revealed (and if the police knew all about it, why wasn\u2019t the reader informed, I\u2019d like to know?) Dalgleish is admired by his sergeant and clearly thought a Sexy Beast by the family\u2019s attractive widow, but I never really got a clear impression of what made him such a striking figure. I guess it took James a while to build him into the Sensitive Loner Dectective that sent readers\u2019 hearts a-fluttering.Two factors in particular made this story seem very dated to me. One was the omniscient narrator, popping happily into the suspects\u2019 heads without warning and in a very erratic fashion, as if the writer occasionally became tired of doing the storytelling and handed the job over to someone else for five minutes. The other, alas, was the voice of audiobook narrator Penelope Dellaporta, which was standard BBC refined actress\u2014I\u2019ve become so unused to hearing this voice that its plumminess tends to get on my nerves. Furthermore, when I was listening to the audiobook without earbuds, there were odd popping noises as if people were playing ping-pong in the background. It didn\u2019t happen when I put my earbuds in\u2014very strange.And, oh my goodness, every upper class character in the story was a resounding snob. Except, perhaps, the vicar, and vicars are, socially speaking, neither fish nor fowl. The descriptions of the lower orders\u2019 houses were spectacularly condescending\u2014was James playing to the sensibilities of her supposed readership, or was this how she actually thought? It seems almost impossible that English society was that hidebound just fiftysomething years ago.The story wasn\u2019t bad, apart from the tendency the characters had to explain their actions very carefully in chronological order, helpful if you\u2019re the sort of mystery fan who loves the timetable aspect of investigation but not very realistic. There were some nice twists, and the whole thing culminated, very satisfactorily, with the great detective gathering all the suspects together in one room and methodically explaining what happened, with further twists in the tale being provided by timely interruptions. All very mechanical, really, but interesting\u2014you can see the straight line going back to Dorothy L. Sayers and forward to the writer P.D. James would become in her later life. Development of the Mystery Story 101.This methodical method of building up a story was a bit on the slow side, of course. But it\u2019s a true portrait, I think, of a world that was being swept away even as P.D. James was writing. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing her move into the 70s . . . although, of course, if I remember anything of the Dalgleish stories I read, she tended to adopt the closed-community scenario where people were sort of stranded in time."}, {"userName": "Nikki ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nikki", "userReview": "Meh. P.D. James is a competent writer and puts together a reasonable mystery, but there's nothing exciting about it -- I felt like I'd read it before, honestly. The Kindle version has very bad formatting, too (\"that\" turns into \"mat\", for example); no one bothered to proofread it. None of the characters are particularly interesting to me -- again, I seemed to have read all about them before, in other crime novels.I think I had the same reaction to another P.D.

Two things stand out: long sentences and a somewhat confusing omniscient POV. There were moments when I thought: who is this talking? What? Whose head am I in? There's also the custom of placing quotation marks around thoughts, so very often I'd be thinking - what? Is She or He saying that aloud? However, Ms. James does conveniently write, 'his thoughts were,' or 'she thought,' etc.., but if you read quite speedily and are accustomed to quotation marks indicating spoken dialogue, well then, get with the program! This writer is an artist and one of the finest of her generation! So I did. I buckled down, read more slowly and found the book a delight. I'd originally read it about thirty years ago, but as I read, remembered most of it. A young, unmarried and uppity maid - mother of a child, no less! the horror! - is found dead in her bed. Her cocoa has been tampered with; her neck bears marks of strangulation. There are several members of the wealthy, entitled family she works for hanging about, not to mention two sort of live-in or visiting guests. (I love this about murders set in English country homes - they always have these hangers-on about who just mess up things in a lively and entertaining manner.)Of course Mr. Adam Dalgliesh - or Detective Chief Inspector - is called in to solve the case, and he does, quite handily. With lots of interviews, most of which makes everyone nervous and suspicious, and a bit of tidy detective work involving fingerprints, bolted doors, outer doors and who locked them up and when, a ladder, a young boy, the local vicar (naturally!) and a country doctor. It all makes for a lively and fascinating read.(I especially love the fascination of locked and unlocked doors when it comes to English country homes. There's often a lot of discussion about who has a key, who came home when, who 'locked up' or forgot to, and often why 'we' don't lock our doors because, of course, nothing ever happens out here or in this tiny village, and so on. This kind of discussion can go on for pages!)But read this book very slowly or you will get lost!"}, {"userName": "trishtrash", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1873333-trishtrash", "userReview": "This was James\u2019 first crime novel, debuting DCI Adam Dalgliesh who gets far less character padding or attention than the victim, suspect pool, or even his accompanying sergeant. I enjoy James\u2019 character building enormously, it\u2019s really her forte, and especially the way she often leaves Dalgliesh to the role of observer, concentrating on the crime rather than the draw of a serialised detective. In Cover her Face, none of the characters are overly likeable, but they are all very strongly presented, their actions, opinions and dialogue very human\u2026 if a little dated, in places. The Maxies have taken in Sally Jupp, single mother, and recent resident of a refuge for women in similar \u2018trouble\u2019, to be their maid. Sally proves to be ambitious, secretive and a trouble maker. When she is found dead, the family reaction is more affront than surprise. But the motive that seems obvious dangles just out of the reach of provability\u2026 only painstaking assessment of the family and guests\u2019 movements and characters will winnow out the culprit. Good old fashioned detective work, in other words.I\u2019ve read these out of order over the years, just now coming to the first book, and was surprised to find it so cohesive. It isn\u2019t perfect; for a start this is written to be a puzzler, not a gripping page-turner, but James\u2019 writing skills cover up any small flaws; she\u2019s no less competent a storyteller at book one than book fourteen."}, {"userName": "Miriam", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/237469-miriam", "userReview": "I see Dalgliesh is James' recurring detective character, but we don't get a strong personality here.

It suffers from all the flaws I've found pervasive in her other novels \u2013 boring descriptions, unlikeable characters, and zero suspense. The mystery plot has a lot of painstakingly crafted red herrings and clues, but I just didn't care enough to be interested in the solution. And I don't get the appeal of Adam Dalgliesh. Your star detective is supposed to have personality, so people want to read about him, you know. The only indication James ever gives that Dalgliesh is not a robot is that every now and then she'll have him think about his dead wife. But other than that, he is as flat as paper. The cover blurbs set him up as a rival to Ngaio Marsh's Alleyn, but um... being boring and mechanical is not actually the same as being cool and stoic. Sorry. Afraid I'm done with PD James.

This was James\u2019 debut novel, and it reads quite assuredly for being such. A well constructed, if unsurprising, mystery. I don\u2019t mean that the identity of the killer was unsurprising; I mean that, in general, the book stuck well within the confines of its genre. One thing I found notable \u2013 and quite liked \u2013 was the beginning of the novel. I enjoyed that James introduced us to her characters \u2013 and started the action \u2013 before the murder.

D. COVER HER FACE. (1962). *****. This was James\u2019 first Detective Chief Superintendent Adam Dagliesh mystery, and marked her entrance into the field superlatively. I\u2019ve always wanted to read these mysteries in order, but, unfortunately, read them as I found them. Some little pieces of data are given in each installment about Dagliesh that help you to know the character better, but does not affect the reading of the book at hand. In this case, there is a killing at Martingale, the ancestral home of the Maxie family. The current Mr. Maxie is on his death bed \u2013 and has been on the deline for several years \u2013 being taken care of by his wife, Mrs. Maxie, and the housekeeper, Martha, a long-time retainer. Mrs. Maxie feels the strain of both keeping up the manor and taking care of Mr. Maxie and so hires on a young girl, Sally Jupp, from the local home for unwed mothers to help out. Sally is a pert and efficient assistant around the house, but soon begins to get on everyone\u2019s nerves by her superciliousness and air of secrecy. She is installed in an upstairs bedroom, along with her young son. Mrs. Maxie\u2019s daughter, Deborah, begins to hate her because of her disdainful manner. Martha is very annoyed with her because she shows disprespect to her in numerous minor matters in the kitchen. Mrs. Maxie\u2019s son, Stephen, a surgeon at a London hospital, is the only one who seems to take a shine to her. This, of course, alientates Catherine, Stephen\u2019s assumed intendent. When Sally is found dead in her bedroom, both sedated and then strangled to death, there are no end of suspects. All of this has to be worked out by Inspector Dagliesh, which he does through great deductive reasoning. This is a mystery that is hard to put down. You have to read it through to the end.

I like how intelligent James writes. This is the first Dalgleish mystery and I must say I enjoyed as much as the others I've read. Dalgleish is almost a peripheral character in the story, James rather focusses on the other characters/ suspects and their activities, motivations as she develops the story. Basically, Sally Juup, a housemaid is found dead (strangled) in her bedroom. All of the family members are suspects. The story follows Dalgleish as he performs his policework, interrogating the family members, travelling around the area to discuss Sally's character and past with family members and other relations. But at the same time, the story also follows around the people from the estate, allowing us to see their motivations, their thoughts on the murder, their own investigations. It's an interesting way to present a case and I found the story well-written and interesting. There were some nice little surprises which added to the story.

It was very interesting to see the character introduced, and gratifying to find this an engrossing read, full of the sensitivity to motivations and subtexts -- as well as the overarching class consciousness -- expected from a fine British novelist. Dalgliesh's personal history is barely touched upon in a single paragraph, which I also found interesting.

There is the upper class family who lives in their family manor and is attended to by servants. One of these, Sally Jupp, was a meddlesome single mother and her death by strangulation is what brings Inspector Adam Dalgliesh into the the case. In typical fashion he interviews all the suspects, looks beyond the obvious solutions, and in a confrontation gets the killer to admit to the crime. Few other writers today capture the feeling of Christies mysteries, and P.D. James does a great job of that. But I found the pace slow as she spends a long time building up the backgroud before we get to the crime. The puzzle was also not as complex as Christie and it was easy to guess who the culprit was. Inspector Dalgliesh was an excellent sleuth, as the hints to his background were enought to be intriguing but not enough to answer all the readers questions.

James' very early Dalgliesh novels. Much like UNNATURAL CAUSES, it displays a certain dated view of society no longer seen in the 21st century. Whereas it is displayed in UNNATURAL CAUSES in the author's attitude toward disability, in COVER HER FACE it emerges in the portrayal of an unwed mother as a sly, deceitful, and wicked person who happens to be physically beautiful, but is targeted by virtually everyone around her a sinner and a wretch from whom gratitude is expected. Of its time,perhaps, but still irritating.The fact that the said \"wicked person\" is actually quite clever and manipulative meets with its moral due in that this character is the murder victim.Having said this, James actually is more creative with this situation, and the plot turns several corners and holds quite a few surprises, so the result is not quite as ham-handed as the earlier book.A good mystery, to be sure, but noteworthy mostly in an anthropological way to see how P.D.

A weakness is the shifting POVs which can be used more ambiguously but I think in this one some of them disqualify themselves by too obviously being clueless about the possible guilt of others.The victim is well written, partly because of what can be read as the author's reluctance to slut shame (and a couple of times various characters observe that \"everyone\" sleeps around in any case). The few romances (especially the surprise one at the end) are less well written, are sort of a self-consciously \"sophisticated\" and \"modern\" (for 1974 which was the year I was born incidentally) that dates by 2016 and is still fairly misogynist.Oh and I am sure I have said this before but I find Adam Dalgleish sort of gross and irritating!"}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2514526-shannon", "userReview": "Was able to finish this book but couldn't really care how it ended up - not one redeeming character and very little development of the Detective.

The narrator was fine but the sound was tinny. I got used to it but it sounded like it had been recorded in 1962 when written rather than 2008!None of the people I suspected might be the killer of maid Sally Juup turned out to be the one. The murderer was really a surprise and that was a good enough reason to round up! There is little action in this book and that's just fine. The murder occurs about a 1/4 of the way into the book, after we've seen a bit of Sally Juup and know she is probably a bit of a schemer but as the story goes on we find out how very much a schemer she was. Sally is the one murdered - just after she's announced that the young man of the house -- Dr. Stephen Maxie -- has asked her to marry him. Suspicion immediately falls on the people in the house when Sally was murdered -- Maxies (mother, son, and daughter), the Maxie's nurse, daughter Deborah's friend Felix, and Katherine, a nurse in love with Stephen Maxie. Now the Maxies own and live in the manor house. Sally Juup is their maid. Her parents were killed in the war and she was raised by her aunt and uncle. Sally got pregnant when she worked in London and goes to a \"home\" in her home town to have the baby and after he is born, goes to work as the live-in maid for the Maxies. In addition to being a schemer, Sally is very secretive. She tells no one who the father of baby Jimmie is. She takes a real dislike to Deborah (how dislikes her back) and just before she dies, is seen mocking her. The local police call in Scotland yard and Malcolm Dalgleish appears to investigate. He uncovers much intrigue. Eventually the potential suspects are gathered together and Dalgleish reviews the evidence and the suspects discuss and ask questions. One by one suspects are shown to not have done it until one is left. This was an entertaining detective story. I will have to read more P.D. James."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21938800-john", "userReview": "P.D. James first novel and is the first one I have read. A cracking good mystery with a few clues and a myriad of red herrings. Sally Jupp was a very sneaky and unlikeable woman who liked to play games with peoples minds. Bolted doors, drugged drinks, ladders and a list of suspects that all hated her. The family she was the maid, foster parents and a jealous woman as well as Martha the cook. The Maxie dysfunctional family and hanger ons created a great background with Inspector Adam Dalgliesh there to bring all the clues together. The ending was very reminiscent of Poiret solving a murder by outlining the story and ultimately the motive laid bare. Really looking forward to reading more P.D. James."}, {"userName": "Tory Wagner", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6192327-tory-wagner", "userReview": "I recently read a Dagliesh mystery and decided to go back and read the first book by P.D. James that featured this character. Cover Her Face introduces this enigmatic character who has become famous in England and across the pond. This mystery takes place at a quintessential British manor and multiple suspects abound in the death of a servant who has created an atmosphere of fear and hate among the residents of the manor. Through skillful interviews, Dagliesh gets to the crux of the matter despite many possible suspects."}, {"userName": "DoodlePanda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29050708-doodlepanda", "userReview": "It has been a while since I read a classic crime novel, as my tastes have changed over the years. But it was an enjoyable read once I got into it. The first chapters took me a while to get through as there were a lot of characters and names presented in a short amount of time and it was a little confusing at first. But once I got into the story it got more interesting."}, {"userName": "Arnis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6257859-arnis", "userReview": "https://poseidons99.wordpress.com/201..."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5456299-leah", "userReview": "A very enjoyable murder mystery.I've been curious about P.D James for a while now, so I bypassed my bulging 'Golden-Era' crime novel shelves and tried this second generation lady mystery author. On the whole, I wasn't disappointed.James writes well, engages the reader with the characters, and has some very strong opinions on the state of society as she saw it, which she was definitely not afraid to air. Some of the topics to get a tongue lashing from her included the morality of youth, unmarried parenthood, and 'good old' English cooking.This novel's greatest strength was the depth to which we got to know its characters, and James never made the mistake of introducing too many, or all of them at once. We get to know them slowly, spending a little time inside almost all of their heads, seeing the story from all angles - even the murderer's - and by the end we are invested in the situation. Agatha Christie often introduced the whole cast of characters immediately upon arrival at the old manor house, and then making them all very pale plot points with little to distinguish between them, leaving the reader (or at least, me) confused and bored. James has created just the right amount of suspects, enough to cast suspicion far and wide and still have time to delve into their psyches in some detail. The only let down here was that, having got to know all the suspects so well, the unmasking of the murderer was underwhelming; not because it was obvious (it never is to me), but because it was unsurprising.The novel's weakness, in my opinion, was the relative blandness of James's detective, Adam Dalgliesh. While this is his first appearance in fiction, and he therefore might be excused for not being fully formed, he put me in mind of Peter Robinson's DCI Banks - a generic third party with few personal thoughts. He slides through doors, asks quiet questions, and knows all about it after a day or two. I realise that Poirot or Lord Peter Wimsey are not realistic depictions of humans, and that possibly the creation of larger-than-life detectives was passe, but I can't get behind someone with no apparent personality. The point is, it could have been anyone solving that case - Dalgliesh did nothing special and showed no special crime-solving abilities. He had no little grey cells, so to speak.However, I enjoyed reading this book quite enough to warrant reading the next one."}, {"userName": "Snort", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1548976-snort", "userReview": "\"Death Comes to Pemberley\" so says P.D. James, but before risking any sensibilities, I thought it wise to dip a tentative toe into her first novel, in order to judge whether she may do Austin justice. Many will agree that \"Pride&Prejudice\" is such Perfection that I'm loathe to destroy it with inferior associations, which is why I have yet to embrace the blood-thirsty \"Pride&Prejudice&Zombies\" (despite my hearty appetite for the Walking Dead), and why it took me 7 years to watch the Knightley movie adaptation.I wish I discovered P.D. James earlier. There was a time when I was Agatha Christie's biggest fan, devouring every one of her novels, and yes, even the Tommy&Tuppence ones, so now you understand. There was then the despondent period after, when I mourned her limited oeuvre of 66 murder mysteries. P.D. James may have plugged that listless hole then, for both Christie and James employ the same deliberate slow prose and aura of regal British upper-class assurance. \"Cover Her Face\" also marks the debut of detective Adam Dagliesh, the Poirot/Marple equivalent. He too waits till the final chapter to gather all involved (in the study, preferably with a log fire), dissect every clue, reveal a couple of scandals and denounce the guilty, always to gasps of disbelief. Thus, you can understand my profound hurt and disappointment when I actually correctly guessed the murderer in this novel.None of the characters are particularly compelling. I have a soft spot for red-heads (Anne Shirley, Nancy Drew, Pippi Longstocking, the Weasleys...) but the death of Sally Jupp (\"...her flaming gold-red hair turned in a flash of sunlight\") failed to incite any indignance whatsoever. Mrs Maxie was too remote in her grief to be personable, while Stephen skulked like an overgrown child. Deborah was quite the charmer, as was the dapper Felix, but unfortunately only in the most 2-dimensional way. Catherine would be a solid bore in real life, but really the only character fleshed out properly through her wistful, thwarted crush for Stephen.So yes, I wish I discovered P.D. James earlier, but that golden time has passed. An unappreciative 2 stars, because \"Cover Her Face\" did save me from intractable boredom during a recent trans-Tasman flight.PS: Pemberley, I am unlikely to come!"}, {"userName": "Bill Rogers", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18019148-bill-rogers", "userReview": "[ because in the end it appears that all the detection was unnecessary; the solution of the crime would have made itself self-evident once a few encumbering side details were wrapped up  (hide spoiler)]"}], "description": "On the same day as the St Cedd's church fete in the grounds of her home, Martingale, Mrs Maxie learns of her son Stephen's engagement.
