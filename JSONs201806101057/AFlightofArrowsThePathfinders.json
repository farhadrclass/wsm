Which I realize sounds ultra gushy but if any book deserves massive gushing, it's this one. I know it's barely mid-January, but I can say without a doubt I've already read my favorite book of 2016.I read A Flight of Arrows in a day. This takes place near the beginning of the Revolutionary War, and the history is meticulously laid out...which I loved. Yes, there are quite a few names and events and locations to keep track of, but really, that just made the story all the richer for me. The plot moves at a great pace...picking up and slowing down in a really nice rhythm. There were moments leading up to major events--battles, rescues, momentous decisions by characters who feel SO real--when I was legit holding my breath. :) The romances are lovely and aching. And the emotional depth...oh. my. Seriously, it's just gorgeous and heart-wrenching and beautiful and perfect...and it resonated with me in a deeply personal way.You will want to read the first in the series, The Wood's Edge, before moving on to this one, if possible. Understanding the various characters' pasts--especially Stone Thrower's--makes their current journeys and choices all the more meaningful.Huge, huge, impossible-to-sum-up love for Lori Benton's latest!"}, {"userName": "Lori Benton", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22315743-lori-benton", "userReview": "Dear Readers,The Pathfinders series is really one story told across two books. A Flight of Arrows tells the second half\u2014the life-altering consequences of choices the characters made in the first book, The Wood\u2019s Edge\u2014played out against the turmoil of an 18th century frontier war. As usual with my characters, those you met in The Wood's Edge (Anna, William, Two Hawks, Reginald, Lydia, Good Voice and Stone Thrower, etc.) are wrestling with and working through issues that have been stirring in my own heart in recent days. Areas where God wants to grow me up a little more. Into His image. Into Christ-likeness.As I explored these issues and told this story of adventure, love, war, family, sacrifice, and triumph, it became clear to me that it went deeper than words on the page, deep as an intimate conversation between me and a sovereign, loving God. It is a statement of trust that He is working all things in my life together for good. Even the hard, heartbreaking things. At its essence it is me telling Him how I see Him, declaring, \"I believe you. I trust you. No matter what.\" My hope is that by the last page of this book you will have experienced a stirring of renewed trust in a good (and good-doing) Heavenly Father standing ready to light your path. To give you a future and a hope. My anticipation for this book's release is off the charts! Can't wait for you to dive into \"the rest of the story,\" as Paul Harvey (for those of you old enough to remember him!) would say. :)Blessings!Lori"}, {"userName": "Chantel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5822088-chantel", "userReview": "\" \u201c ...when Creator said He would make rough ways smooth, I believe He was not talking about moving us to an easy path.

I read the epilogue twice!!!If you have not read The Wood's Edge yet. Please, please get yourself a copy of this literary awesomeness, ASAP! :-) This book had everything you want in a story. From the beautiful and vivid writing, the complex characters, the action, the drama, the love! The message of forgiveness is so beautifully Illustrated in this story. You see the ups and downs of each character, and the brokenness thar their actions cause. But you also see the healing and restoration the only God can enable. This book really shows God's unfailing love and how His hand is never to short to save! I'm so glad I read this book, I never want to forget the character's or what I learned from their lives. I am definitely a fan now, I can't wait to read more her books!Bless you Lori Benton for writing such a amazing stories that really show God's love in action.

But it is my thinking that men do most of what they do for two reasons: for love or for pride.\"Epic! Beautifully, wonderfully epic! From the first page to the last, Lori Benton knows how to spin an epic story. A story of family ties, love and desire, the clashing and blending of cultures, frontier life challenges, the war of Independence, disgrace and grace, crime and justice, forgiveness and grace. And it is AWESOME! Grand in scope and atmosphere, richly emotive, deeply passionate and beckoning, characters I would love to dive through the pages to meet. This second book in Lori Benton's The Pathfinder series was every bit as wonderful to read as was The Wood's Edge with only a few minor exceptions. \"[God] make[s] our stride long enough, our legs strong enough to carry us through. And when we reach our limits He puts us on His back and He carries us.\"Overall, highly recommendable! However, this is a series that really needs to be read in order. And I need to note: \"Arrows\" was a bit overdrawn and over-extended toward the end - coming really close to becoming sentimental melodramatic. Not my favorite fiction attribute. Truly though, in the grand scheme of things, anyone who enjoys cleanly written family sagas, romance of substance, and/or epic historical-fiction will find this a fabulous series.

Almost as bad as the suspense that builds to the very end! How can I say all the things that this book made me feel? There truly aren't words. Lori Benton is a masterful writer. I suffered many things alongside these characters. I love them all. And then, when I thought I couldn't take much more, there was Caleb Stone Thrower's incredible gesture, and its far-reaching results\u2014ah, I was equal parts amazed and hurting and angry and oh\u2014just so emotional at the good it brought about. If you want your Christian books to be chock-full of incredible Christian lessons and examples, look no further. There are so many lessons of actions and consequences to be found in this tale. But I can't say much more without breaking into spoilers for at least the first book, so do yourself a favor and go buy this book and the first one and take two days off work so you can read the story all at once!*16+ for battle scenes and for a couple mentions of marriage benefits/wishing for them"}, {"userName": "Olivia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43582060-olivia", "userReview": "What can I say except I'm blown away again! I closed this book and said to my sister, \"That was amazing.\" It's almost impossible to describe it any other way, but I'll attempt to find the words to do so. A book that stays with me after I pick up the next book is one I cherish fully. A slow start...literally, crept through the first few chapters. I wasn't ever really worried, though. Close to halfway, I knew I would have a hard time putting it down. Funny thing...I still put it down after I read a couple chapters! Emotionally, I knew the book would effect me and I wanted to savor it all. I can't even begin to describe the relationships and ties of characters in this book! How does she do it? Every single person is vital for the storyline, and by the end I realized that the author wrote a book that all we writers should take note of. Not just because the story is beautiful and full of God's beautiful message, but because she writes a book RIGHT! Every detail is important...and that is what makes a superb author.The moment this book became a five star with me was when the strong message of honoring parents became a theme of the story. I'm tired of books that downplays the role of parents, tired of the attitude against father's especially, and have been all too ready to read a book that encouraged me to honor and respect my parents as God has clearly pointed out in the Bible. Wow...can I just say it again! Two Hawks blew me away-his whole character was honorable and even when his desires sought to take hold over God's Word, he made the right choice. When we do the right thing in following God's Word, He will bless. Anna, Lydia, Reginald, and William's stories came to life as the story proceeded, melding into the clash of war threatening their lives. The Oneidas were beautiful and profound people, bringing a strength to a book that I loved. Their way of speaking drew me in and the depth of their conversation concerning the Lord's salvation and guidance in our life blew me away!The romance was a little heavier at the beginning, but overall the relationships were realistic and not cheesy in the least. There was one circumstance with a couple that was awkward, but I felt that the author handled it extremely well, showing the strength one character had. Still, it was a scene that I still could have done without, but thankfully it was only brief. And then the ending. I can't spoil it, but when the truth hit me of what was happening, I could barely comprehend it. This book is so full of turmoil, yet I felt so at rest reading it, feeling the workings of God's strength and peace through each character. Oh, how I love this author and her books!!There are so many amazing quotes in this book, so I instead I will simply encourage you to pick up this book and a see a beautiful story come to life like the workings of our own."}, {"userName": "Amanda G.

A Flight of Arrows, book two in THE PATHFINDERS series, continues from The Wood's Edge, to finish it's intriguing tale. Oh, how I love Lori Benton's novels, with their depth and richness, beauty and sorrow.Amidst harrowing battles of the American colonies' War for Independence, two families struggle with forgiveness, bitterness, acceptance ... Torn asunder, they strive desperately to be reunited. For unity and healing. But can the bridge they gap between the white men and Native Americans?The journey to restore William, and to receive approval for Two Hawk's and Anna's love, has begun.Lori Benton has a beautiful writing style - it just draws you in. I quite enjoyed this book, with its twists and turns, ups and downs. The theme of redemption and grace, so poignant and bittersweet! Anna's struggle to forgive and honor her father, pulled between him and Two Hawks as she is, was very real. A Flight of Arrows doesn't gloss over the trials and pain; characters do not get the easy way out, but are forced to deal with their mistakes, and also the sin of others. The faith aspect is deep here. God is near; you can see His hand weaving together the brokenness into something beautiful. I loved these journeys of faith! The mending of relationships! The choosing to do the hard thing, because it is the right thing. Very thoughtful and profound.Two Hawks and Anna ... I love them!! I only wish there could have been more of them together! Often, in this book, came heartrending separations. So yes, I wish there could be another book for them!I so enjoyed getting to know William better. Loved his journey. Love where he is now. Also was so happy to see more of Good Voice, Stone Thrower, and Lydia. Reginald isn't my favorite character, I have to admit, but his story is an amazing one, a good one, as well.It's all so masterful, how their lives twine together. Heartbreaking and bitter in some ways, yet joy and such beauty come through! I'm thrilled to have A Flight of Arrows on my bookshelf, and can't wait to get The Wood's Edge to sit beside it! So beautiful, these two! ^_^But I suppose the reason for rating A Flight of Arrows a star less than the first book is ... well, it was a hard book in some ways. The separation. The sacrifice. And though you see God's hand so powerfully in the circumstances, even the hard ones, I still felt there was so much tension and pain and fear, it was hard for me to relax in the end and enjoy the beauty of the Epilogue. I suppose I'll have to go back and read it again after I've had more time to take in everything that happened.But overall, A Flight of Arrows concludes this dramatic tale in a thought-provoking, powerful, and lovely way. I love the history, the family aspect, the romance, and the faith themes of Lori Benton's novels. And absolutely can't wait to read more!I received a copy of A Flight of Arrows from Blogging For Books program in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4075354-beth", "userReview": "What a happy occurrence it was to discover such a wonderful author as Lori Benton! Continuing on with the story began in The Wood\u2019s Edge, A Flight of Arrows is such a perfectly-balanced story \u2013 captivated by the plight which my dear friends found themselves in, I was always sad to put this story aside. It truly has a bit of everything that a reader could want \u2013 compelling family drama, sweet and endearing romance and suspenseful scenes of war and negotiations where lives hang in the balance. I loved this story, agonized over it and ultimately came away with such a hope and happiness from it that I know I\u2019ll be reading it and The Wood\u2019s Edge again. This is truly one of those books that I enjoyed so much that it\u2019s hard to review because the picture painted overall is so organically portrayed, but I\u2019ll do my best.First, the setting and the historical detail \u2013 the history here is so rich and textured. One thing that really enhances my reading experience is when the setting is vivid and thoroughly portrayed. Lori takes time to describe and set up scenes to where I felt fully immersed within each moment of the story. Sure, there were places, names, and timing to keep up with, but for me, nothing was overdone or hard to follow. I gobbled up the details and feel that they made the reading experience that much better.The characters are some of my favorite that I have ever met. Usually when there are several characters in a story, I have a preference for one over another. In this story, I sincerely loved all of the character equally and thought they all contributed to the story in a realistic way. Through these characters, Lori shows how the choices one makes in a split second can be life-altering, not only to the one who made the choice, but to everyone connected to them. The choice Reginald Aubrey made in the beginning of the first book has been revealed and its consequences are being played out in dramatic, realistic fashion here. These flawed, wholly-human characters won my heart as they fought for love and family, redemption and forgiveness.I can\u2019t say much about the heartrending climax of the story without giving something away, but the feeling and sacrifice shown by these characters brought tears to my eyes. The effects of this decision were also far reaching, but in a way that showed a beautiful, redemptive contrast with Reginald\u2019s decision all those years ago. The epilogue gave me a feeling of satisfaction and joy, without feeling like the road to this point no longer mattered or that there would no longer be struggles and hurdles for them to overcome. I love when stories don\u2019t truly feel wrapped up, but rather you can see the characters as they continue on in their lives. It was superbly done.A Flight of Arrows is an honest, uplifting story of faith. Both of the Pathfinder books are on my keeper shelf, and I am already looking forward to reading them again."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24104675-rachel", "userReview": "Such an intense follow up to the first book in the series, The Woods Edge!

I have to give credit where credit is due. A Flight of Arrows is probably one of the best sequels I have ever read. It is set at the beginning of the Revolutionary War and the historical accuracy is meticulous. Lori obviously went out of her way to fully research and dive into Revolutionary history. A Flight of Arrows is history, it is a love story, it is a story of forgiveness, and also a story chronicling Native American history which I very much appreciate.

The first book in this series, \n won 5 stars without a doubt. I absolutely loved the first book and looked forward to the second one - which I really enjoyed, but didn't love like the first book.The major reason I did not find the book as gripping as the first, was all the historical detail. Yes, the historical research was done brilliantly and everything happening in the story is based on actual events which was well researched, but all the detail overwhelmed me. I found it a bit distracting and sometimes boring.However, the spiritual themes, struggles and Christian truths contained in these pages is well deserved of a 5 star rating if not higher. Both books in this series is rich with Biblical truths. I haven't read a book this year which could compare to the spiritual depth contained in this series. From struggles with a rebellious heart, stubbornness, bitterness, hate to forgiveness and acceptance, everything the reader experienced through these characters were true and real.My favourite characters were Stone Thrower and Two Hawks, based on the growth they both experienced through a relationship with Jesus Christ. I loved to see the redemption of Reginald Aubrey. The highlight of this book was the ultimate sacrifice made by one of the characters I came to love. It was so heartbreaking, but at the same time so powerful and motivating. This series is highly recommended for readers who enjoy historical fiction. Series should be read in order.

Battle scenes kept tension taut and emotion high, vivid in detail without ever losing Benton\u2019s exquisite sense of syntax.And the characters\u2026. Oh my goodness, the characters. They are breathtaking and honest, and they have set up camp in my heart. The characters are flawed, to be sure, but realistically so. Dare I say, encouragingly so.

Her attention to historical detail and descriptions of the Revolutionary War battles involving these 2 families is once again well done. It was easy for me to place myself in the middle of this historical period as the characters lived out their lives in the midst of war. The characters are superbly developed, complex, and realistic. Anna is still fighting for the love between her and Two Hawks although parents of both realize the problems with which they will have to deal. Reginald is still facing his self-imposed prison for his past deeds. Good Voice and Stone Thrower are still seeking William's understanding. And William is still trying to deal with his knowledge of his real parentage. All of this happens while Revolutionary battles keep them away from one another. It may be that only God as well as people he uses can bring these families back to accord and help them all to forgive. And one person will make the greatest sacrifice in order to be used by God.This hauntingly, beautiful story with rich historical detail, minor romance threads, and strong characters is one that can be enjoyed by any historical fiction reader.FAVORITE QUOTES: \"You remember to trust in Heavenly Father.

Lydia stepped into Anna\u2019s life and was a mother to her, Two Hawks had a great relationship with his parents and his uncle, and Anna had a great relationship with her brother! I was drawn into the story itself. I was constantly concerned about the characters and would even talk out loud, telling them what they needed to do to survive. Yes, I\u2019m weird.

Despite a few explicit words used within its pages, A Flight of Arrows is stunning and exquisite, threaded with turmoil and sorrow and redemption and much love. It is a story that will most assuredly stay with me for a long time after turning the final page.One thing I really admire about this book is how Ms. Benton placed each scene in the perfect order. Time and time again I found myself amazed at how this scene had to come at that time in order for this other scene to make sense when it came around. Everything was woven together so seamlessly and completely, leaving me weeping through the last several chapters.(If you want to know what moved me to tears, you\u2019ll just have to read A Flight of Arrows for yourself. But, I recommend you get the first installment of the story first, by grabbing a copy of The Wood\u2019s Edge. To get the full effect, these stories are best read in chronological order.)In the book, the Revolutionary War is in full swing. Lori handled the battles in such a way that transported me to the forests in which the battles of that war took place. Her research, attention to detail, and writing prowess combined to create incredible, realistic scenes of a country tearing itself apart in more than one way. With each book of Lori\u2019s I read, I continue to be even more taken aback by the finesse and tenderness with which she handles the toughest scenes.Her skills also lent themselves well to welcoming me into the world of various Native American tribes. I have long admired the original residents of my country, and I think Lori Benton has captured the essence of each of the tribes she wrote about in A Flight of Arrows. I felt swept away, taken to a world of which I had only read about in history books. But Lori\u2019s writing immersed me in the land and culture of the People my favorite character, Two Hawks, called family. Those scenes spent in Kanowalohale and on the battlefields with the various tribes are so precious, for vastly different reasons, and I felt glued to the page as I read them.The only reason this book earned four stars instead of five from me was because of the four expletives used.Thank you to the publisher, WaterBrook Multnomah, for the complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Amanda Geaney (Christian Shelf-Esteem)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20217965-amanda-geaney-christian-shelf-esteem", "userReview": "{Originally posted to ChristianShelfEsteem.wordpress.com.}Occasionally, a story will linger with me long after I've finished it. This was the case in October 2015 when I read Lori Benton's The Wood's Edge, the prequel to this selection. It pierced my heart in a way that left me yearning for the rest of the story. A Flight of Arrows is the powerful, heart-mending, soul stirring conclusion to The Pathfinders Series.When William Aubrey learned of his true Native American parentage he was thrown into an identity crisis. Seeking to distance himself from the man who'd deceived him, he fled North to join the Royal British Army. It's 1776: as the army prepares to advance towards his home and the ones he once loved, second thoughts begin to surface. Anyone who has ever found themselves on one path wishing they could do an about face and run the other direction will connect with William.Similar to the first book, Anna and Two Hawks remain my favorite characters. Having confessed their love for one another they are earnestly seeking her father Reginald's blessing to marry. In an admirable show of character, Two Hawks encourages Anna to honor her father while he searches for a way to earn Reginald's favor.This series possesses great depth in both character development and spiritual content. Lori Benton skillfully uses her characters to remind us of how God can turn something intended for evil into something good, that He is patient in waiting for us to come to repentance, and that His timing is perfect. It was beautiful to read how these two families forged a friendship through their trials and prayers \u2014 united in Christ. Lori's writing moved me to tears once again.A Flight of Arrows will be on my Best of 2016 list and I believe The Pathfinders Series is a top pick for book clubs.I received this book free as a member of the Family Christian Blogger program.

This is a beautiful, masterfully woven story of two completely different worlds colliding together because of the sin of one man. While there's been untold heartache because of one man, Reginald Aubrey's choice, there also is healing, hope, and deep love that also come from it.

That one was magnificent. This book bring us back to the ending of The Wood's Edge as we find William Aubrey off fighting for the British while Two Hawks and Anna and all the rest are back at home. Reginald Aubrey can't forgive himself for the events that he set in motion 20 years earlier, even though God has already forgiven him. He holds himself apart from those who love him dearly because of his unwillingness to allow God to change him. Anna Catherine and Two Hawks long to be together but are respecting Reginald's wishes. Lydia loves Reginald but he can't seem to see it. There are so many broken hearts in this book. Those are a few of the circumstances.Lori Benton has again crafted a tale that is both heartrending and joyous at the same time. It is wonderful to see God working in the lives of the Oneida Indians here. Just such a blessing. Good Voice and Stone Throw, Daniel Clear Day. What characters she has created! I loved diving in and settling down inside this book. It is very deep and satisfying. Her historical research is impeccable, too.There were tearful moments and moments of pure delight in this book.

From Disc 9 until the end, I can't count how many times I listened with tears streaming down my face and my heart well north of its customary place of residence.

No one connected to Reginald Aubrey is untouched by the crime he committed twenty years ago. Not William, the Oneida child Reginald stole and raised as his own. Identity shattered, enlisted in the British army, William trains with Loyalist refugees eager to annihilate the rebels who forced them into exile. Coming to terms with who and what he is proves impossible, but if he breaks his Loyalist oath, he'll be no better than the man who constructed his life of lies.Not Anna, Reginald's adopted daughter, nor Two Hawks, William's twin, both who long for Reginald to accept their love despite the challenges they will face, building a marriage that bridges two cultures. Not Good Voice and Stone Thrower, freed of bitterness by a courageous act of forgiveness, but still yearning for their firstborn son and fearful for the future of their Oneida people.As the British prepare to attack frontier New York and Patriot regiments rally to defend it, two families separated by culture, united by love, will do all in their power to reclaim the son marching toward them in the ranks of their enemies.", "title": "A Flight of Arrows\n      \n          (The Pathfinders #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27209312.A_Flight_of_Arrows__The_Pathfinders___2_", "average": 4.49, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1445791804l/27209312.jpg", "reviews": 148, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6577118.Lori_Benton", "name": "Lori Benton"}], "type": ["Historical", "Christian Fiction", "Christian", "Romance", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27209312-a-flight-of-arrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28246434-a-flight-of-arrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28783590-a-flight-of-arrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16142057-burning-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18168221-the-pursuit-of-tamsen-littlejohn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22822928-the-wood-s-edge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33775907-many-sparrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28168785-runaway", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148447-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35913695-hidden-secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198274-kiss-me-while-i-sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839275-kian", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26186801-someone-like-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800300-from-thin-air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18950617-sweet-caroline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800331-to-hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33016164-royally-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34609092-royally-ruined", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193474-the-finishing-touches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193549-roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19032297-accidentally-in-love-with-a-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29231863-splinter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23622993-claimed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243614-just-jilted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800455-the-pms-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800812-gypsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35708042-bodyguard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800579-willow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30126159-mosaic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389026-summer-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12369122-because-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29373539-the-lullaby-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28441063-secretly-hers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23271170-tycoon-takedown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800411-come-high-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33001355-before-i-knew", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205166-the-paradise-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425515-once-haunted-twice-shy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40272947-the-pursuit-of-tamsen-littlejohn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193595-the-story-of-beautiful-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11781578-lover-s-leap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800690-love-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36685093-the-unimaginable"]}
