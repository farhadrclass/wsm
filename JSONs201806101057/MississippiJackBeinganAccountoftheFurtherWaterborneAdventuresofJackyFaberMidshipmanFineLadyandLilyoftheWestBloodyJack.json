I usually listen to these in the car and as people drive past me, they see a crazy middle aged woman laughing her head off as she's driving. Really, if you are suffering from road rage, start listening to this series. You'll find all sorts of excuses to drive around, just to listen to the many exploits of Jacky Faber. Well, I got sick of paying the ridiculous prices for gas in my neck of the woods so I decided to listen to Jacky's story on my MP3 player instead. I think that I listened non-stop for 2 or 3 days and this morning I couldn't help myself - there I was talking back to the audio book! OK, crazy middle aged woman - I know you are thinking that. But here's the thing: L.A. Meyer's series is incredible and along the way you actually learn about things. What strikes me about this series is the incredible cast of characters. The author intersperses historical characters along with his own fictional characters to make a wonderfully entertaining story. While reading this series, I have also travelled (1800's style) from England to the Caribbean, to the coast of France, Spain, and England, to Boston, and in this installment from Boston to New Orleans via the Mississippi. Jacky Faber is one of the most endearing female characters I've ever had the pleasure of reading. I love how she can leave a trail of suitors behind her and amass many friends and supporters along her voyages. I also feel for Lt. Jamie Fletcher, Jacky's true love and how the two always seemed to miss each other at every port of call.These are really long books and I highly recommend the audio version as the narrator does all sorts of voices and really brings Jacky's character to life. This series is suitable for young adult readers and older. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Grace", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/212266-grace", "userReview": "This is the fifth book in the series and in all honestly I was hoping it was the last. Granted, the book truly has it's moments and the writing, though not great, is good, but the plot is extremely - or a better word might be excruciatingly - predictable and getting very stale as the series wears on. With every book Jacky and her \"true love\" Jaimy are always just a moment away from happiness and being together forever before their hopes are dashed yet again and it's getting old fast. Personally I think they should just admit that they're never going to be together and get on with it, besides that I don't even like Jaimy all that much. There are just way to many coincidences to be allowed and I really wish that the author would take some risks. He never goes outside what is expected or surprise the reader in any way. The character development isn't all that good either and you never really get to know the other characters enough to care that much for them anyways, besides Jacky and Jaimy. At times I found myself forgetting about a few of them because they hadn't even been mentioned for a few chapters, and these are the people who Jacky is living with! Or otherwise asking why they don't seem to be around (almost the entire book takes place on a boat, so they can't have gone far)The book can be described as suspenseful, however, with the plot being as predictable as it is, the suspense is - for lack of a better word - fake. I knew that whenever Jacky gotten into a fix she was going to get out of it relatively (and at times, annoyingly) unscathed. I'm probably going to end up reading the next ones, but only because it would be a complete waist of time if I had gone through five of these books and didn't finish them."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/446464-kathryn", "userReview": "Another wild and wonderful adventure with Miss Jacky Faber! Here Jacky is on the run from the British (again/still!) for the bounty so unfairly placed upon her spunky blond head. Her journey this time takes her \"out west\" to the frontier (in early 1800s sense of the word, i.e., Ohio. Ever in love with ships and the water, it is inevitable that Jacky will soon be floating along the Mississippi River and Jacky's flair for the dramatic is put to good use on a show-boat of her very own making. But, all is not smooth sailing as Jacky and her crew encounter river pirates, hostile Indians, cruel slave-hunters, and even a group of British soldiers headed by the undeniably handsome Captain Richard Allen. Will Jacky be able to navigate the muddy waters and find her way to safety in New Orleans? Can she reunite with her fiance Jamie (and will he still want her)? Will she ever be able to return to her dear Mother England, or will America charm her to stay? This is probably my favorite Jacky book yet because there is so much variety in her adventures and also more fun and romance. It still deals with some important historical and humanitarian themes, but overall things are just more lighthearted and I enjoyed that for a change. In addition to some of our familiar cast, such as Higgins, Katie Dear and Jim Tanner, this book brings some wonderful new characters to life such as the talltale-esque Mike Fink, the sly showman Yancy Cantrell and his intelligent biracial daughter, the Native American Chiaquat and his white \"brother\" Lightfoot, and poor little Clementine Dukes so eager to be loved. I will refrain from gushing about how much I love Jacky's character, Katherine Kellgren's narration for the audiobook, etc. as I have already done so quite loquaciously in my previous reviews! Suffice it to say Jacky is one of the most vivid characters I've ever encountered and I am infinitely glad the series remains strong, well-written and engaging as she certainly deserves it!"}, {"userName": "Katie Hutchison Irion ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900711-katie-hutchison-irion", "userReview": "Ahh, 200 pages in. All these thrwated meetings with Jaimy are KILLING me! I'm a bit bugged with his traveling companion and little sleepover friend Clemmy. What is he thinking?? It is bugging me but he still writes the sweetest letters to Jacky. I'm still liking him. Sorry ladies.Jacky, how could you give up a Lord of the Realm?? As you all know, I am a big fan of that slippery Jaimy Fletcher but I sure loved Lord Richard Allen. Geez, how does Jacky get all these guys in her life? She is one cheeky lady. So, I LOVED this book. I think this has been my favorite so far. I LOVED the adventure and the additional characters. I thought the characters were such, well, characters. Couldn't help but like Mike Fink and his constant yelling. I like Katy and Jane Crow and Lightfoot and the Indian guy whose name I can't spell. I liked Clancy and his daughter and Solomon and Jim and that trampy Clementine. Yes, I even ended up liking her. I did expect more of something when her past relationship with Jaimy was revealed. That Jacky is forgiving. Well, I guess she has to be considering how Jaimy found her. Loved the scene on the boat with Jacky and Jaimy. I don't care what you say. I still like him. LOVED the scene in New Oreleans when all of Jacky's enemies were gathered around her. Laughed and laughed about her wigs. Can't get enough of this Jacky. I guess I see why she gets all the guys.

However, I needn't have worried. Given a large body of water, (in this case the Mississippi River) Jacky soon has herself set up as the captain of a nice little river boat with a crew of mostly trustworthy characters.This book, like all of the others, moves. Jacky is in and out of trouble so fast it's dizzying, and she's very lucky that she has quite a few people who love her. I really do love her loyal friends, who risk life and limb time and time again to get her out of trouble because she's been good to them in situations when not many people would have. (Which means that I love Higgins doubly, because he's stuck his neck out for her more times than all the rest of them put together...)Though I was happy with the amount of time James Emerson Fletcher got in this novel, not nearly enough of it was with Jakcy. I do like the contrast between his journey down the river and hers, though. All in all, a most worthy entry into one of my favorite series. And this one doesn't end with a heart-stopping cliffhanger like many of the others do, so while I would dearly like the writer to hurry, I'm not climbing the walls wanting to know what's going to happen.

And once again, Jaimy is writing her these awful letters and he has a new girlfriend of sorts in tow. And Higgins.. I loved him at first but now he is getting old. A grown man giving a teenage girl a bath in the 1700s? I don't care if he is homosexual. It's getting weird. And this Fink guy, they couldn't get rid of him fast enough for me.Well, number six has Jackie being a spy so I will move on..

Seriously, though, this one was kind of a letdown. The book picks up right from the cliffhanger ending of the last book; faced with imminent capture by the British Royal Navy for piracy, Jacky is rescued at the last minute through the cunning schemes of her loyal and talented friends. Needing a safe port to ship out from, she decides to make her way down the Mississippi River to New Orleans. Accompanied by her steadfast friend John Higgins and the taciturn Katy Deere, she bluffs her way down the river in typical showboating Jacky Faber style, encountering new friends and enemies... and leaving a trail in her wake for the ardent Jaimy Fletcher to follow, who has deserted his post to track down his love once and for all.So, the story encompasses the length of her journey down the river, and reads about like any other similar story of rafting through the Deep South during the slavery days. Which works fine, really; Meyer infuses this story with the same charming ambience and historical adventure that he does with all of the other Bloody Jack books. But other than the new locale, there isn\u2019t really anything new, here; Mississippi Jack feels intensely formulaic. It\u2019s all been done before: Jacky visits an exotic place with unfamiliar people, who love and accept her right away! Some handsome older man immediately lusts after Jacky, and though a rake, proves honorable in the end! Jacky tries to reunite with Jaimy and humorously fails, multiple times! Bleh. Jacky\u2019s trip down the Mississippi is punctuated by a variety of exciting and unlikely adventures, but none of them are particularly memorable, especially compared to the books that came before.There are a couple of bright points, which are the same bright points that mark the entire series. Jacky Faber has just the right mix of charm and infuriating naivete to make her a loveable character, despite her Mary Sue-ness. The supporting characters are less developed, but are still immensely fun to read, and add a lot of flavor to the story. And it\u2019s nice that Jaimy finally gets a little action this time around; I\u2019m so used to seeing him as the cardboard cutout love interest that it was refreshing to read about his own adventures, even if he doesn't have the uncanny luck that Jacky does. Also, I have to say that I\u2019m a pretty big fan of Mike Fink.There\u2019s a lot to like, and I\u2019ve been pretty forgiving with this series so far, but the ending of this one more or less ruined the entire book for me. I\u2019ve noticed a pattern of strong stories with weak endings from Meyer, and this one was particularly egregious. After a completely ridiculous plot device that recalls the flying tree business from the first book, the story wraps up with surgical precision in roughly two chapters. All of the major players in the story mysteriously meet up all at once, apparently through sheer chance. Jacky neatly overcomes two entirely separate endgame obstacles in the space of about five pages, and the story wraps up with a sterile happily-ever-after moment. This, mind you, after a meandering story with an erratic pace (though that\u2019s fairly typical for the Bloody Jack books) and, damningly, no perceivable climactic moment. It reads like Meyer didn\u2019t know how to end the long and complicated story he had written, and so he just tied all of the story threads into a big bow in the last chapter and left it at that. It wasn\u2019t badly done, per se. It was just so extremely unsatisfying that I couldn\u2019t really help but hate it.So, yeah... not a terrible book, but definitely not my favorite, either. After finding the first four books so enjoyable, this one feels a little stuck in a rut. I like the books enough to finish the series, though, so hopefully the next one will be composed a little better."}, {"userName": "Miss", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/165171-miss", "userReview": "Jacky Faber is the light of my life. :D This has been an excellent month so far for heroines.

Keep it up July, I am definitely digging this trend.ANYDOODLES. Basically this is Jacky Faber does Mark Twain! Naturally she thrives. :D We also get the occasional foray into Jamie's headspace which mostly consists of his repeated declarations of how much he hates America. Oh Jamie. If only you were a multi-talented versatile actress/musician/lady/maid/midshipman/company owner/showboat captain like Jacky. America is the land of adaptability! You can't go in when you've only ever had the one Navy career!What I am saying here is this book and the series it is part of is wholly enjoyable. I am looking forward to Jacky charming her way through the world in book six and can only hope it will include extra encounters between the Lawson Peabody girls (team Jacky-Clarissa all the way!

She and Higgins, along with young Jim Tanner (a young boy she took in, in the last book, to mind her small lifeboat and set fish and crab traps around Boston Harbor to make money) set out to follow rivers down to New Orleans. Along the way, Katy Deere (a serving girl from the school) joins with them, having been the leader of the rat hunters on the slaver. They pay for passage at an exorbitant rate from a flamboyant riverman, Mike Fink, and then end up buying his ship from him and leaving him behind when he is drunk.Setting herself up as a passenger boat, Jacky gains a crew, refits the boat, and gains passengers.Jaimy had been following from Boston, but was near-killed by highwayman. He is found naked in the woods by a farmgirl, Clementine, who decides that he must have been sent from heaven to help her escape her abusive father. She is very taken with Jaimy and they meet with the riverman Mike Fink who is determined to kill Jacky for taking his boat. They travel a bit - until Mike Fink ends up in a bar fight, and Jaimy is arrested with him. Both are sentenced to hard labour- with Jacky in town and preparing to sail. Clementine realizes who Jacky is and joins her crew as cook's assistant.Hijinks ensue, especially when special agents of the British intelligence service catch Jacky eavesdropping on their plans to offer a confederation of First Nations tribes various amounts of money for American (white) scalps. They put her on a boat of British regulars and try to torture her for information, but she is rescued by her crew. The intelligence officers are stripped to their underwear and left on opposite river banks miles apart to fend for themselves in the middle of nowhere.She commandeers the British riverboat as well, and the captain has a thing for her. Jaimy catches up with Jacky just in time to see her kissing the captain in order to pay off a bet. He of course takes off down river without waiting for an explanation (because if characters acted rationally or expressed themselves and communicated more than dramatic gestures the majority of the book wouldn't happen...)A gang of slave hunters catch up to the ship, taking one of the passengers (a free girl of colour), murdering that girl's father, as well as taking a crew man (who is an escaped slave) and Jacky herself. They plan to hang Jacky until she claims to be pregnant (she most definitely is not...), so they decide to tar and feather her instead. She is rescued by her crew after being tarred.A hurricane strikes when they are nearly at New Orleans, and then Jacky is carried off by a tornado. Bedraggled, her ship nowhere in sight, she makes her way into New Orleans and to a house of ill repute where a woman she knows from Boston is employed. Jacky takes a job as musician and card dealer, tangles with slavers whose cargo of men and women she set free in South America. She manages to fleece the slavers at cards and buys a new ship. She learns that Jaimy had signed back on with the British navy and follows him to Jamaica, where they promise to meet again in London in a year's time."}, {"userName": "BookwormBritty", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734315-bookwormbritty", "userReview": "This book made me so so sad. Is there anything worse than seeing characters you love degraded into THIS? Where to start?The story itself was irritating, everything that could go wrong did, you saw every misstep coming, and there's no suspense in that. It's just constant action and drama and outlandish and ridiculous situations, not in the fun and slightly unbelievable nature of the previous four books, but taken to a whole new level. But I could have dealt with that. Here's what really got me.Oh, my Jamie, how I used to love you. But now you, sir, suck. And Jacky, you too.***************SPOILERS TO FOLLOW***********************So I've always thought Jacky's free way with her kisses was a bit disloyal, but I guess that read to me a 15 year old girl who gets a bit carried away with her flirting. Jamie actually falls in love with someone else, and the way he uses a poor vulnerable victim of abuse when he KNOWS he's promised to someone else. If I read it right, deprives her of her virginity, and all along knowing he's probably not going to marry her. If I were Jacky, I think I'd have been just as upset about his crappy show of character as his betrayal. Add to that the fact that when she comes back and tells him about the picture Jacky has of him, he's still more upset that she's leaving than that he's been a huge cheating turd to Jacky. And Jacky. You used to just flirt and cavort, and I forgave you for whatshisface in book 3 because you thought you and Jamie were over, and it was kind of funny that you had to show your butt to get bathwater, but that was more about showing that Jacky Faber does what she has to do. Okay, but now you're just being a bit of a ho bag. Not to mention scamming people with your fake medicine. Up to this point, Jacky's adventures have toed the line of the law, but never really at someone else's expense. I didn't like this or her lack of remorse for it at all.I agree with the reviewers that said they should've just axed the romance entirely rather than bring it to this. Something along the lines of, Jamie loved Jacky but acknowledged that nothing could hold her down. She loved him but was just too free spirited to tie herself down to anyone, so they resolved to part as friends. Book twelve they meet again, she's grown up, they get married. That would've made sense. It would've made her exploration of everything male that moved understandable, not always colored with the hue of betrayal. I really can't stand cheating, and it actually churned my stomach to read the scenes where Jamie was writing to Jacky and falling in love with Clementine. Where was his honor then?All in all, I actually hated this book, up until and including the resolution of \"We both did the best we could.\" Really, Jacky? The best you could do was kiss everyone who tried and the best Jamie could do was sleep with a fourteen year old and tell her he loved her and lie about his preexisting promises? What made this all SO MUCH WORSE was that the author could have easily written them TOGETHER in the frontier adventuring and the book would have been so incredibly much better for it. After reading reviews that more of the same happens in future books in the series, I'm not sure I'm going to read any more at all."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2377263-kristin", "userReview": "Well, I read for this book for 3 hours while I had insomnia last night.

The beginning of the book seemed a bit lax. It did not seem like it had as much action in the beginning as it could have had. The continuing chasing of Jacky by Jaimy seemed a little ridiculous due to the fact that he literally chased her across the country. When Jaimy finally caught up to Jacky it was the worst timing ever. It seemed a little unfair to Jacky with how bad Jaimy and Richard's timing was. The slave hunters with how much they pursued Jacky and her crew made it seem like they needed to get a life. Tarring and feathering Jacky seemed like it was too cruel to do to a pregnant woman. It seemed especially cruel because it could actually kill a person. Leave it to Jacky\u2019s crew to rescue her just in time after she got tarred. It figured that after Jacky got resettled on the Belle that there would be a Hurricane then a Tornado that would pick her off the Belle and fling her. It seemed just like Jacky to buy yet another ship in search of Jaimy. Overall I thought this was a great book and it kept me glued to its pages for the entirety of it.Plot: The majority of this book took place on Jacky\u2019s riverboat The Belle of The Golden West. Which she \u201cbought\u201d from Mike Fink while he was ferrying them down to New Orleans. After she \u201cbought\u201d the boat she then with her crew continued to sail it down the the many rivers that she needed to ferry to reach New Orleans. Along the way she transported cargo and passengers to various spots down the rivers. She made stops at numerous spots along the rivers to perform and sell \u201cCaptain Jack\u2019s Elixir\u201d. Along the trip she lived among a Native American tribe during which she was captured by British Intelligence. After being rescued she brought along the British regulars who captured her in their riverboat. After releasing the British soldiers she along with two black crewmen she had were captured by slave hunters. Jacky was tarred and feathered she was rescued almost immediately after she was feathered. After the tar and feathers were washed off a hurricane and a tornado struck. The tornado picked Jacky up off her riverboat and flung her downriver where she found a raft and floated down to New Orleans. She met up with Mademoiselle Bourbon there. Jacky then worked in New Orleans for a time after which her crew found her. Jacky then earned enough money to purchase a ship which she would use to find Jaimy in Jamaica. Characterization: Jacky\u2019s personality only changed a bit during this book. She seemed to get a bit more humility as the book went on, especially after her time with the Native Americans. She seemed to get especially meek after she had any run in with a man who tried to harm her.Impacts of Setting: The setting for almost the entirety of the book was on a riverboat which helped to cement the fact that Jacky was a fugitive escaping from the British empire. The novel took place in the early 1800's because the Louisiana Purchase is mentioned in the novel as having just taken place.Thematic Connection: A theme I got from this book was that if a person lived in the frontier should not trust anyone who seems to be doing something for them out of the goodness of their heart. This was shown by the numerous run ins Jacky and Jaimy had with people who betrayed the people they were helping. Recommendation: I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of fourteen; I say this because some of the content would not be appropriate for audiences younger than fourteen. In addition I say either gender would enjoy this book because it is not too focused on fighting or romance so either gender could like it."}, {"userName": "Nick Imrie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5906293-nick-imrie", "userReview": "[given an Indian name and weclomed into the tribe (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Samantha wickedshizuku Tolleson", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2237173-samantha-wickedshizuku-tolleson", "userReview": "After the last book, which in fact traumatized me for life, I took a break from this series for about a month.

Part of that could have been because the book takes place (a large part of it at least) around the Western Pennsylvania area where I grew up. Pittsburgh, Johnstown, and other locales are beautifully described in this story \u2013 even though some harm does come to our favorite characters in these places \u2013 the author nailed the era and location perfectly. (As well he should \u2013 since he grew up in PA himself.) I was absolutely delighted to listen to Jacky and Jaimy learning how to muddle through America. Yes, this audiobook shone brilliantly \u2013 as have the others in the series.Rife with music, laughter and adventure, this story was a wonderful follow up to the previous, darker book, In the Belly of the Bloodhound. Though Jacky\u2019s situation and story maintains it\u2019s more mature rating, it wasn\u2019t nearly as dire or difficult as the last one to follow. The audio adventures give us a glimpse into what it must have really been like at the time as the story is peppered with a variety of tunes that would have been popular at the time.Once again, Jacky Faber\u2019s brilliance, adventures and glory are completely enthralling. The audio book version shines with exceptional detail and production qualities and the storyline is fun, has some educational value and is fabulously engaging.Highly recommended!Review copy provided by the publisher and Listen and Live Audio.

Jacky may be inland, but she always finds a way to stay on water as much as possible. This book is full of new twists, a possibly reunion with Jaimy and some adventures that involve pirates, a whorehouse, and trying not to get killed.Characters: I love Mike Fink. What a fantastic character. An over the top troll of a man whom Jacky steals a boat from. I absolutely love when the narrator did his voice. Such a loud, hilarious man and almost always in the liquor. I also loved meeting the other characters introduced in this book and hope we continue to run into many of them in the future. Jack is herself as usual, always cunning and of a positive nature even when in death's grip.Relatability: Probably one of my favorite books in the series. It's hard to pick one, but this one is definitely up there.Cover Commentary: I love the old covers, the new ones are awful and look nothing like the Jacky I picture. 1st review: Well.. this better not be the last book. I always want more with these books (even if they are 600 pages + of adventure, humor and even romance...).It's good to finally see somewhat of a happy ending, but I'm still not satisfied if this is the end of the series.

I'm afraid this is my last Bloody Jack adventure. As the series has progressed I've realized the author has the same plot mechanics repeated over and over again, ad nauseum. In the last couple books I realized this, and held the opinion that it was of no consequence, and that the story was still engaging. Oh how wrong I was. The heroine (who really is a bit dimwitted considering how many times she is captured) is confronted with capture, followed by rescue, followed by worst-timing-ever, followed by ludicrous weather event, followed by capture again. I could go on. The plot is riddled with these opaque blunders, and loses all pretense of subtlety.As a disclaimer: I really did like her, mostly, before reading number five in the series. But unfortunately Miss Faber seems doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. To me, this is a sign of a flat character. I think were I her friend, or suitor, I would have thrown my hands up and walked away long before then end of this book.I imagine some people like this kind of drama, but I prefer my protagonists to have a deepening and progression of character. And not to drive me insane. A bit of plot variety is appreciated as well.That said, books one through four are worth reading."}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1593137-jess", "userReview": "Alright, I took a break during this book.I didn\u2019t mean to take a break mind you, it just sort of happened. I\u2019m in the USA Navy myself, and unlike good \u2018ol Jackie I find myself tethered down a mite bit quicker than she, and have suffered lack of reading because of a ridiculous work schedule during deployment. So a whiles ago I had read a good size of this book, but laid it to the wayside due to work requirements. In fact, I haven\u2019t been able to read ANY book in the past few months.But I just couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and read a book the other day. That\u2019s when I recalled that I had been reading this one. Mind you it was close to 2230 and I had to be up at 0530\u2026 and I had already been neglecting my sleep previous days.\u201cJust read a little bit\u201d my mind told me \u201cjust a smidgen to get back into it, we\u2019ll finish it later on in the week.\u201dAnd of course, around 3 hours later I finally put the book down, finished.DAMN YOU JACKIE!I love this series too much!"}, {"userName": "Caitl\u00edn (Ink Mage)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/995753-caitl-n-ink-mage", "userReview": "This is (so far) my favorite book in the Bloody Jack Adventures. The plot is thick with adventures and escapes and new characters and old with a hilarious finale and a happy ending. The collection of accents was great, and so was hearing Mr. James Emerson Fletcher's side of the story for once. Like other reviewers, I am also a little tired of Jaimy and Jacky being so close to meeting again and missing each other by minutes, but oh well. On the whole I loved it!

Meyer's delightful characters, this book is where the series goes down in quality, in my opinion. A few of the new characters, such as Fink, come across as two-dimensional and over-ridiculous. The language is often unnecessarily crude, and when all else fails in the plot, Jacky can sing a tune and everything will be fine again. There are a few ridiculous rabbit trails that took away from the main storyline, such as Jacky being welcomed as a member of a Native American tribe after a couple of days (because that's what has to happen if your hero travels west) and eventually being carried away by a tornado but otherwise unharmed. Some new characters were a joy, and I really did like reading more from Jacky, but compared to the first few in this series, Mississippi Jack disappointed me."}, {"userName": "Carly O'Connell", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20142521-carly-o-connell", "userReview": "The series continues to be enjoyable although a few things have started to bother me, notably Jackie's blurred concept of consent, Jamie's proprietary feelings towards Jackie, and frequent episodes of cultural appropriation, such as Jackie being immediately adopted by a Native American tribe after spending a day with them."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2165276-pam", "userReview": "I do enjoy these audiobooks! So much fun, and quite unpredictable really.The near misses between our Miss Jacky and her Mr. Fletcher do drive me a bit crazy. But then I suppose if they ever managed to get together for more than 5 minutes they'd actually get married & she might have to sit still rather than galavant around the countryside.I also like how she is a very strong & clever woman but not the stereotype of a cold, emotionless female with anger management issues. Rather she is very emotional and prone to bouts of bawling. I find this endearing and refreshing in a character."}, {"userName": "Alline", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2135231-alline", "userReview": "Book five in the Jackie Faber series continues to strain at credibility.
