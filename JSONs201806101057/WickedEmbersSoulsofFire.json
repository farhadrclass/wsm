Jackson Miller and Emberly are still after the missing research notes on Crimson Death. They need to confirm those notes are still out there, find them and stop the sindicati coming after them. Since there are two factions they need to find out which one is after them. So for the most of the book you follow Em and Jackson looking for various players connected to Crimson Death research notes. The leader of red cloaks is revealed and I can't say it surprised me. There are lots of hints to who he is in previous book too. Sam makes an appearance a couple of times. Although I haven't quite warmed up to him yet, he wasn't as bad as in the first book. At least he tells Em what happened to him.The other story Em gets involved in through her dreams is a bit neglected thanks to their main investigation. A pity.However, the hunt for this shape-shifting creature announces what is to come since it seems to be one of the first in an approaching darkness wave. And Emberly is one of few who can see the early warnings thanks to her dreaming gift. You could say Wicked Embers is sort of a transitional story: they are still after the notes and there is something worse than red cloaks coming.Anyway, even though I would have liked more of the story about the creature and less of their moving around the city looking for various people, Keri Arthur has yet to disappoint me. I love the rules of her fictional worlds (if you've read any of her books, you'll know why). They will always make her books better than most others where authors don't bother to follow the rules they themselves set up."}, {"userName": "Carmel (Rabid Reads)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4561998-carmel-rabid-reads", "userReview": "Reviewed by: Rabid Reads.Keri Arthur used to be one of my MUST read authors; her RILEY JENSON GUARDIAN novels are still, to this day, some of my all time favourite werewolf books. Then, I gave her DARK ANGELS a whirl, and my zeal for her writing took a bit of a dive. Being the ever dedicated fan-girl that I am, I snatched-up FIREBORN and enjoyed it. WICKED EMBERS on the other hand was freakishly similar to Arthur's other two series, so newcomers will probably enjoy it, while as seasoned stalkers like myself might conclude that it\u2019s just more of the same.The story was good\u2014prophetic dreams about a beast on a killing rampage, and the red cloak plot line thickens. I was hoping for more phoenix mythology, but that particular aspect was (unfortunately) a little on the light side in this installment. The action was plentiful, and surpassed my Urban Fantasy standards; then again, I'd expect no less from this writer because that's her #1 strength when it comes to this genre, well that and thread weaving.Emberly is clearly a hybrid of Riley/Risa. Her abilities are different; however as I mentioned, the author didn't really go into them that much, so the variations were negligible which made all of the other similarities extremely noticeable. Sam could be the meat in a Quinn/Azriel sandwich, and Rory is a close proximity of Rhoan/Tao, except she doesn't have sex with either of the latter which brings me to my next point...I accepted Riley's promiscuity because she's a werewolf, and they tend to get around. And, maybe that's unfair of me, but all three of Arthur's heroines have been easy lays, and don't know the meaning of the word monogamy. It's difficult to cheer for a protagonist who thinks with her woman bits first and her brain a distant second. That being said, I'm deeply tempted to pick-up the next title based solely on the last sentence. There was nothing significantly wrong with WICKED EMBERS; I've just read this book three times now."}, {"userName": "Jeanny", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16737045-jeanny", "userReview": "I'm on the fence on if I'll be following this series. Unfortunately the idea behind the phenix does not line up with the reality that is this series. I'm not a fan of Sam & her unhealthy obsession with him is annoying. He's an asshole. Ember is pretty weak as a character & in some cases emotionally pathetic (with the ongoing whining).I do like Jackson but not enough to continue the series simply bc of him. All the other characters aren't developed enough to keep my interest. The next installment promises Ember becomes proactive & that has some possibilities. Overall the book wasn't great. In fact 50% I thought of DNF-ing it. At this point I wouldn't recommend the series unless your goal is to fight insomnia bc this book was yawn inducing. 2 stars"}, {"userName": "RachelW (BamaGal)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31722634-rachelw-bamagal", "userReview": "Not a bad story by any means; it just wasn't anything new. Emberly is a variation of Riley/Risa; and her sex life/need for sex runs along the same lines as the previous two series. And like the previous series, Em's sex life is hashed and rehashed like it was a separate character. Why does every h in Arthur's world have to be a slut to survive? Oh, and Sam is turning into long-suffering Quinn/Azriel; waiting by the side while Em/Risa/Riley have sex with other characters. The case itself, about a serial killing shapeshifter and the redcloaks, was pretty good; but the book itself reeked of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in both plotline and characters. If you like Riley and Risa, you'll like this. It's more of the same. Except for being a Phoinex, Em IS Riley/Risa. This book could easily fit into either series with minor changes.

I think that I was a little less carried away this time but I had again a great time with the story and the characters.As in the first volume, a premonitory dream will launch our heroine, and Jackson, on a new investigation. Indeed, it seems that a strange creature is in town, leaving corpses in her way. As it was eating on freshly dead people, it seems that it now wants to turn to the living, and the youngest, the best. Then, it\u2019s up to Emberly to understand what is happening and to stop the creature before it kills someone. But this quest will also lead her to cross the path of her ex, Sam, and thus to face all the feelings she is trying to bury deep within herself. Yet that\u2019s not all \u2026 In fact, our characters will also face the consequences of the first volume, that is to say the becoming of the humans into something else because of the epidemic that is spreading elsewhere more and more. It also seems that many conspiracies are running over it all.Many things are mixed in this novel, many events and it is quite important to remain attentive to the details not to get lost in the story. By cons, it is true that we learn a little more about the Jackson\u2019s past, about the life of the phoenixes or even about the reason for the sudden change of attitude for Sam. I confess that I suspected about the revelation, as well as the identity of the villain of the story, but it\u2019s true that it was interesting to learn more. By cons is true that I was really surprised by the new type of creature that Keri Arthur brought us here and the author reserves us many things about it.Of course, the story between Sam and Emberly remains very tense and I wonder if one day the tensions will diminish a little bit so they could talk a little more about what they want both. This relationship makes me think of the one between Quinn and Riley from the Riley Jenson series and I wonder if the purpose will be the same.In any case it was a good second book and I\u2019m curious to see what the next book will present us."}, {"userName": "Yodamom", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905141-yodamom", "userReview": "Urban fantasy, action packed, suspenseful and fast.Emberly is flaming hot and sharing her life with her two men Rory and Jackson.

I loved the idea of a phoenix, but the story is a spin off. So, same world of Riley, similar settings. Good for fans, but not exactly new. Still the vamp mafia is such a \"fun\" idea :)Anyway, good, but not great. I never get the urge to read her books again.Ms Arthur' stories remind me of one a friend of mine told me close to 25 years ago. She was in Melbourne (Australia), visiting a family member. They went to a disco or club one evening. After a while she went to the Ladies. But once there she was stunned to see a couple blocking the entrance...because they were having sex. In public.Need being what it is, she went looking for someone to tell her if there was an other toilet. The barman brought her back to the same place, and, unflappable, lifted the lady's leg (still being shagged against the wall), and told my friend to get in. So, I am not particularly shocked with the different sexuality in her books :). I have always thought of Aussie as a place with less \"restraints\" than either USA or Europe *grin*."}, {"userName": "\u2646 BookAddict  \u2712 La Crimson Femme", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3089655-bookaddict-la-crimson-femme", "userReview": "Another fabulous series from the talented Ms. Arthur. Full disclosure, I did not read the first book in this series. I recommend reading this series in order. Still, I loved this book. Emberly is a fascinating woman who reminds me of Riley from RILEY JENSON GUARDIAN series. The bit of difference is Emberly fully accepts her poly-amorous side. Emberly the fire elemental phoenix is smart, sexy and stubborn. This is attractive in a heroine. The world building in this story is similar to other Ms. Arthur books so it is very easy to slip right into it. The different secret organizations to police the supernatural seems to be reoccurring theme. It's a popular one because it works and in this story, it works well. The mystery part of this story is exciting and enjoyable. Trying to figure out what is happening based on the clues keeps a reader turning page after page. The dark gritty scenes are vivid and easy to imagine. Ms. Arthur paints a memorable picture with each murder scene. The backstabbing and conspiracies between different criminal factions is familiar and nicely laid out in this book. It adds to the complexity of this world and even though it seems as if there are multiple threads going in tangents, Ms. Arthur masterfully reels them all in and creates a somber picture.This story would have been fine without the sex. Without it, it would be closer to urban fantasy. Since there is a bit of romance to it, some may quibble and categorize this as paranormal romance. Regardless of categorization, I argue the sex and the complications that come with Emberly's needs, gives Ms. Arthur this wicked edge. For those who judge poly people as sluts and believe the one true way is monogamy, move on. For those who understand and appreciate love can be shared with more than one person, Emberly's love life makes a sexy torrid twist. The secondary characters in this story are a great supporting cast. Jackson is a man of mystery. Hopefully he will feature more in the next book.This new series bewitches me and I want to read more. After finishing this book, I immediately found the first book to read. Not sure how I missed this new series coming out. This series is not to be missed. This novel is a delicious blend of supernatural, spicy sex and violence. Highly recommended for urban fantasy readers who enjoy strong female leads who are smart and sexually confident. *provided by NetGalley"}, {"userName": "Stacy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3864002-stacy", "userReview": "I am so on the fence about how I feel about WICKED EMBERS. I really like the characters, but like other reviews have stated, they are a lot like Arthur's previous characters and it's really hard not to compare them or be a little bit bored by them and the situations they find themselves in.The actual storyline of WICKED EMBERS was entertaining. The book starts off not long after the events of FIREBORN. There is a new serial killer case that Ember is working to solve with the help of her dreams and the redcloaks storyline continues on and the stakes get even higher. I really enjoyed learning more about the Phoenix's talents as well as their relationships with their life partners. We also get to meet some of Jackson's Fae friends which I hope to read more of in future books. I think you would be very lost if you jumped into the Souls of Fire Series with WICKED EMBERS, so make sure you read FIREBORN before picking it up.

Like the first this has taken me a while to get through which is really funny considering I have a hell of a lot more free time than i usually do. I feel that this book could have been faster paced and had more action scenes and also possibly had more character development since so much time had passed from where book 1 finished and book 2 started. the characters still seem to be a little washboard and the only one who seems to have any emotion is Emberly; and you normally only get a sense of her when Sam has upset her or shes having some bedroom fun hahaha.Don't get me wrong I will carry on with book three but i just hope its more along the lines of book one. Another focal point for me or highlight at the very least would be if Jackson somehow actually admits he is in love with Emberly and she find that he is this lifetimes true love not Sam.... even though she was with him for 5 years.Time for number 3, I think"}, {"userName": "Melindeeloo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2766907-melindeeloo", "userReview": "3 stars = pretty good. Back for a second round of this sexy urban fantasy,I liked the fiery cast: Phonenix Ember, Rory, the mate she needs to survive (but Phoenix mates are cursed to not love each other), and Fire Fae Jackson, her lusty PI partner and current bed buddy. Other than the necessary sexy breaks - because both Fae and Phoenixes need lots of sex - this is mostly just a continuation of the hunt related to the red virus from the first book, and a deepening of impending darkness in the world, as Ember's dreams show her an evil flesh eating serial killing creature who is escalating to the most vulnerable of victims.A more minimal presence of this life's heart breaker is a minus and plus - the sorrow for the loss of the love she is cursed to lose kept Ember feeling emotionally flat, but Sam was so hostile that he was annoying last time around.At this point I am still on the fence on this series, I like the Phoenix idea, but I am less captivated by the background arc. Still the action packed ending of this book left this on a high note and some secrets revealed are promising as well.

She's incredibly powerful and yet not without limitations. She also had a huge weakness for saving others, which while not a bad thing moral wise, it's another story when it comes to her own safety. The risks she take for others is staggering, and I couldn't love her more for it. So much so that you can't help rooting for her even when you know it's almost pointless due the heartbreaking curse she's under in the romance department. I really hope to see that somehow resolve and break during this series even if I'm not the biggest fan of this \"lifetime's\" love. Emberly more than deserves a bit of real happiness, so as I said I'll be rooting for her.I'm really enjoying the unique world behind this series. Not only is the main character a phoenix but the rest of the cast is very varied in species as well. This makesfor a fresh read especially now that we're two books and I have a better grasp on all that's involved. In my review of the last book I had expressed a bit of frustration with the lack of world building or full explanation of what was going on. I'm happy to say that wasn't a sticking point for me this time around. While there's still plenty of unanswered questions I didn't feel so in the dark and was able to fully immerse in the story. So if you read the first book and felt just a bit lost, I'm happy to report it's much another this time around.All in all this was yet another fast paced and enjoyable read from one of my favorite authors. I know every time I pick up a Keri Arthur book, I'm going to have a solid block of entertainment, and this was no exception.

The story is just eh and by the time I made it to the middle I kind of forgot what I had read in the beginning.

In this book Emberly and crew are still trying to track down the research scientists stolen notes which are pretty much their only chance of developing a cure against the red plague virus.

All in all I feel like the book didn't make an impact on me which makes me sad because I like Keri Arthur."}, {"userName": "Diandra", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17447326-diandra", "userReview": "this is still an awesome series and I am still too tired to give a detailed review. The leader of the gray coats is after Emberly and we get the confirmation of why. The darkness is still a part of Sam and we find out what that is too. And who could the mole be?Emberly Jackson and Rory also gain a few allies and get rid of an old enemy. Looking forward to how this story is going to continue to develop. I find myself wondering if there is a chance of Sam and Emberly having a happy ending despite the curse, her finding a good thing with Jackson that continues through this lifetime even if it isn't true love, or will Keri kill her and have her reborn."}, {"userName": "TinaMarie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4169697-tinamarie", "userReview": "Several editing problems, this is a continuation of Emberly's story. She's a phoenix who is mated to another phoenix but in love with a man that cannot accept she must mate with her bonded pair for her survival. She's pretty free spirited sexually and Jackson is her work partner as well as lover. There isn't a love story resolution here, but a murder to be solved and learning more about this paranormal world where some super naturals are out and some are not. Emberly gets visions and she works to stop an evil supernatural who's on a killing spree, while trying to get the vampires off her back."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18837873-kelly", "userReview": "3 - 3 1/2 starsWicked Embers is the second book in the Souls of Fire series, and the story carries on from the first. I still don't like Sam - if he has any feelings left for Em then he really doesn't have a good way of showing it. Later in the book it indicates that he may have more of an understanding of the Phoenix and why Em needs Rory to survive, but he is still pretty much a dick........although he also has some drama going on of his own that would contribute to his mood swings. Jackson and Rory keep the story interesting, and overall I am interested enough in the storyline to continue with the next book and see what happens."}], "description": "Keri Arthur, New York Times bestselling author of Fireborn, presents the thrilling new Souls of Fire Novel featuring Emberly Pearson, a phoenix that can transform into a human\u2014and is haunted by the ability to foresee death....
