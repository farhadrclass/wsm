I didn't really care for the love story part of this book. Veck the hero was likable. The heroine Reilly on the other hand I couldn't stand. The whole book she tells Veck that he can trust her and tell her anything. Then when a bad guy sets Veck up she believes the bad guy. She turns her back on Veck when he needs her most. She not only breaks up with him, without a reason she helps try to build a legal case against him with the aim of putting him in prison. Why because she believes that he is a killer. That is how deep her doubt is for the man she \"loves\". So I didn't buy their relationship because she didn't stand by her man. The angel/demon plot was just okay as well. I felt it was kinda stalled. Overall just an okay read. It kinda felt like series filler, nothing special."}, {"userName": "Buggy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3099666-buggy", "userReview": "Really!? How did I not know earlier that the hero of this book was going to be Thomas \u201cVeck\u201d DelVecchio, Jr from Lover UnleashedGah, how awesome is this? I love the crossover. This must mean we'll also get to see his partner...Jose del la Cruz, yippee. Endless possibilities here; Butch sightings, Lessers, The Band of Bastards (Throe) and the subsequent headaches leftover from his scrubbing. The year long wait for Tohr's book just got a little easier! You rock warden.*Confirmation given at Ward's latest signing (thanks Mahlet) that Throe from the Band Of Bastards will indeed play a role -\"has a meaningful moment in it\" and that we will see more crossover between the two series in general. ~So here's my Spoiler Free review~As others have mentioned this is the best yet from Ward\u2019s Fallen Angels series. She seems to have gotten the mix just right here and I found myself completely caught up in the story, it\u2019s romance and all the many sub characters and their ongoing battles. I suppose introducing the hero in the last BDB book didn\u2019t hurt matters, as from the get-go I was wondering how a Vampire attack and Veck\u2019s subsequent \u201cmemory loss\u201d was going to be explained. However the two series feel very different to me now, and even though I can still sense the BDB world in the background, its no longer a distraction.(I do become a squealing fan girl when I find those cameos though) Speeding black Escalade in the rain or old landlord in a butlers uniform anyone. I would describe this as a romance wrapped in urban fantasy. The mix works though, along with Ward\u2019s usual hilarious male banter, excessive product placement, seriously hot love scenes and a few major surprises -which we should see the trickle down effect from for several books to come. I also feel that she finally got the romance right here; I enjoyed Veck and Reilly and found myself rooting for their HEA.Through some unique world building we also get a much closer look at arch angels Nigel and Colin(who are growing on me) and of course our sexy saviour Jim and his badass fallen angel sidekicks Adrian and Eddie\u2026 (Sigh) Lastly I have to mention Devina. She is just awesome, probably Ward\u2019s best female character to date and a superb villain. Yes she is evil but she is also so much more, what with her therapy sessions, hoarding issues, insecurities and school girl crush on Jim -which let me tell you he uses to his full advantage. Alls fair in love and war bitch. As with all of Ward\u2019s books there are many characters fighting for POV time; popping us back and forth between hero and heroine, into heaven and hell and the minds of angels, demons and anyone else caught in the crossfire of battle #3. I can honestly say though that I didn\u2019t ever want to skip any of their sections (Lessers) as each POV was an integral part of the story and more than held my interest.Yes, the WARDen got it right with ENVY and I can\u2019t wait to find out what happens next.Homicide detective Thomas \u201cVeck\u201d Delvecchio is convinced he\u2019s just killed a man. Haunted by the legacy of his serial killer father and followed by a dark shadow, it was really only a matter of time until he gave in to the dark side. The problem is he doesn\u2019t remember the attack and the evidence says he\u2019s innocent. Sent to monitor Veck is internal affairs officer Sophia Reilly whose interest in Veck grows increasingly personal as they share pizza and a mutual admiration for Victoria\u2019s Secret.Entwined in their budding romance is Jim Heron, now facing the 3rd round in the ultimate end game of good VS evil. He and his two back up angels have been given the task of battling against the devil for Veck\u2019s very soul.Bringing our group together is Reilly and Veck\u2019s investigation of missing person Sissy Barton. She is of course being held by Devina (Crave) Jim is determined to find her body and retrieve her soul from hell whatever the consequences which gives him more reason then ever to shadow Veck, who\u2019s own internal struggle is just beginning. Honestly I could go on and on about the plot. So much happens and I\u2018m not doing it justice here so I will stop. It is intricate, shocking, suspenseful, exciting, sexy and just well played.

I just finished it, and it was good.So, the deal with this series is that it is set in the Black Dagger Brotherhood world. If you haven't read any of those, or don't like them, I wouldn't bother trying this one out. I think one of my favorite things in these books is when there is a familiar character from the BDB world. I get all excited about it, like Buddy from Elf.So, Jim, our angel has to save four out of seven souls to save humanity from eternal damnation. But, frankly, I got a little irritated that Jim keeps focusing on this chick that has been dead since book one. Dude, focus! Fate of the world, and shit?Dammit, Jim! Move the fuck on!The soul up for grab in this book is a cop whose father was a famous serial killer. He thinks he might be turning into one himself, and he's all angsty about it. He's just got a little case of demon possession. What a baby. So you are getting violated in the shower by an unseen evil entity, we all have problems. Today, I went to a new bakery for baked goods and they weren't that good. See, everyone's life sucks.Huh, I think I'm going to follow this guy around for a while. I have a feeling I might see some man-tears if so. Our female is also a cop, and I'm not sure that I liked her that much. First of all, she meets a guy and decides to run to Victoria's Secret on her lunch hour to spend over six hundred dollars on lingerie. I can't relate to a girl like that. Every time I read a romance novel where the girl is dropping a hundred bucks on a pair of panties, I can only think about what a waste of money it is. Oh, and then the guy tears them off her, and I'm like \"OH, HAIL NO! Do you know how much those things cost, dude? And, they aren't even functional. She's walking around with a wedgie all day with a postage stamp piece of itchy lace on the front. If you really like her, you would buy her a 5-pack of soft cotton Fruit of the Looms that will won't ride up her ass.\"And, the prices go up as you go down the list. Panty logic.Later in the book, the female does something else that irritates the crap out of me. Let's just say that she can turn on a person pretty damn fast. Not the kind of girl who will help you bury a body, and really, I don't need someone in my life who isn't willing to get a shovel for me.Still, this was a good book. I'm liking the overall storyline that is going on. I love the Black Dagger Brotherhood references, and I even think the villain is kind of a fun evil. She's OTT evil.On to the next."}, {"userName": "Auntee", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/886675-auntee", "userReview": "[Matthias really going to be the subject of the next book--again?

In fact, I wondered what the hell his side-story was even doing in that book, since it had little or no relation to anything else in the storyline. Obviously, the plan was drive Black Dagger Brotherhood fans to the Fallen Angel series... and I think the idea was kind of off-putting. I would have read this book anyway, but I hated the idea that Ward stuffed its set-up into LU... a novel that was already fractured with so many storylines, the main characters were barely the focus at all.That being said, in his own novel, Veck makes for a pretty interesting lead. He is haunted by the legacy of his serial killer father and a darkness that he has always carried within himself. And as our book begins, he is convinced that he is responsible for that attack on another serial killer named Kroner. Reilly is the Internal Affairs officer sent in to investigate. And she becomes his temporary partner while the police try to figure out what really happened to Kroner. Together, they begin to investigate the disappearance of Sissy Barten... the young virgin Devina killed in Covet. Veck thinks Kroner had something to do with it, since Sissy disappeared around the same time as his other victims.In the meantime, Jim is determined he will find Sissy's body and somehow get her soul back from Devina. And his single-minded focus is causing a rift with his back-up angels Ad & Eddie. At times, the Jim and Sissy vibe comes across as a borderline romantic possibility... which bothers me. Sissy is 19. Jim is 40. Yes, they're actually both dead, but it's still squicky. And with Veck working Sissy's disappearance (and obviously with him being the soul in need of saving for the book) Jim has twice the motivation to be a part of his life.I found that I liked the storyline of Veck's internal struggle, though how Devina got her hooks into him via his father wasn't entirely clear to me. As with all Ward books, the sex was rockin' -- though I was disappointed with Reilly for her lack of faith at a pivotal time. The real meat of the book for me, though, centered on Jim, Ad & Eddie. Some pretty powerful developments take place within their dynamic and we can expect the repercussions to continue into future books. We're also tipped off on the identity of the soul in question for the next book. It's a familiar face, but I don't know how I feel about it.Overall, it was a solid installment in the series... very consistent in tone to the books that came before it. 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Suzanne (Under the Covers Book blog)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3575839-suzanne-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "Caldwell is the PNR/UF version of Sunnydale (from Buffy, just in case you live under a rock!), all the supernatural shit goes down there! You have a Brotherhood of vampires and now we are battling demons to make sure Hell doesn't come bubbling up. Sounds like a crappy place to live, you are likely to either be killed by the Omega or have your soul destroyed by a demon; however, the payoff may just be worth it, Caldwell also seems to be the centre of the hot-man-universe packed full of gorgeous males so manly they make Arnie shrivel up, so yeah it may be dangerous but my Oestrogen is begging me to pack up and move in.Anyway to Envy, I really loved it, it seems to have struck a good balance, in Covet there was a lot of romance and in Crave there was a lot of UF, this one seems to have struck the balance between the two. It manages to move the main plot with Jim et al on, with a few really shocking twists, seriously this book needs a Kleenex warning, but it also has a really great romance in it as well. Veck, if you are up to date on Black Dagger Brotherhood then you will recognize him from Lover Unleashed, if you don't then you need to read it IMMEDIATLEY! I really liked him, he is the typical JR Ward male, tough and protective with a dark edge and she had me lapping him up (ha! If only!) And Sophia Reilly I really liked her as well, I liked that although she was a tough Internal Affairs agent who took no BS, she was also feminine and I loved hearing he pervy thoughts about Veck, I was reading some of those comments thinking \"I am sure I have posted something similar to that on Good Reads!\" She was my kind of girl!What I also like about this series is Devina, I love that I hate her, she is a bad guy that you can get properly riled up about, she isn't half assed about being evil she goes all the way and not only that she poses a credible threat. There is nothing more off putting then a bad guy that can be defeated by your 5 year old nephew with a big stick, Devina isn't one of those!Another great instalment in the series and my favourite so far and I really can't wait to see what happens next, roll on the next bookBrother SpottingI noticed two!1.

I actually do not have a problem with gratuitous sex in certain books, but this scene was inconsistent with the characters. The woman is portrayed as desperate, sad, lonely and only engaging in sex to fill this deep well of loneliness in her yet Eddie still has sex with her. I do not believe that an angel focused on saving the world from demons would use a vulnerable and hurting women just to meet his needs. Yes yes, Adrian helps take care of her at the end, but only after he allows her to be used by Eddie and he participates in it.

Well, it didn't pay off. I didn't dislike Envy, but I didn't like it either. I just wasn't into it, I wasn't interested. Besides I have never been interested in police/detective/crime plots, not in books or movies or TV series; that genre is simply not my cup of tea. The only parts of the books I could manage to rise some curiosity for was the relationship between Veck and Reilly but there was very little of that and it was all mixed up with many other characters POVs that I didn't care about in any way (I skipped some of that to be honest).I definitely think the Fallen Angel series is not for me. I am a huge HUGE fan of the Black Dagger Brotherhood series but these books are vastly different and don\u2019t work for me.I am not interested in the romance, I am not interested in the demons versus angels plot, I am not interested in the story lines, and I don\u2019t care about the characters. The whole dynamic of the books is completely different to the BDB series and they just don\u2019t engage me or even grip my attention in any respect. I am so frustrated because I want to like them so much but I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t wrap my head over it, but I am just not into this series at all. I tried, I really did, but for whatever reason these books don\u2019t make me tick. Why, oh why?I think I gave the FA series a fair shot trying 3 books, so I doubt I will ever read any more books of this series. I am done with the Fallen Angel series for good.The Fallen Angel Series is of a different hue than The Black Dagger Brotherhood series and not nearly as good.

I need a witness! It can be quietly, in your own mind as to not upset your J.R. Ward group 'friends\", or to keep the obvious from your lips but can someone please back me up!!Ward's faux ghetto diatribes have become the most annoying thing since parachute pants. Hammer was not badass for strutting around in 25 yards of fabric and J.R. Ward's characters are not fiercer for trying to sound like they're \"Straight Outta Compton\", leave that to NWA, m'kay!Here are some examples:\nCPDers\n - really, just \"cops\" from Caldwell Police Department\nDiving into his databanks\n - thinking, or maybe thinking really hard\n\"When the screaming pain faded a little, Veck took another run at remembering . . . only to slam temple-first into the land of Excedrin and blackout drapes again\"\n - see what I mean?\n\" 'I can't remember anything after he showed up, and that's the God's honest.' \"\n - How much harder would it be to add \"truth\" in there?\n\"Next door, on the far side of a connector, two deep male voices were doing the back-and-forth, in the key of frustrated-to-shit.\"\n - typical overuse of the hyphen\n\"This goin'-back-to-Caldie-Caldie-Caldie wasn't so much the issue.\"\n - As someone who comes from California and grew up listening to Biggie I'm slightly offended.But really, when an author is capable of such poignant content as, \n\"Not all mirrors were made of glass, and you didn't always need your reflection to take a good, hard look at yourself. The truth was something you wore sure as the suit of flesh that bound and gaged your soul until you were set free, and you couldn't ignore it forever.\"\nit's frustrating when a majority of the text is gibberish such as, \n\"Not a lot of Food Network going down in here: all he had were a couple of empty pizza boxes on the counter and some Starbucks dead solders clustered around the sink.\"\n Starbucks dead soldiers? Come on Ward! Crazy thing is I only went 8% into the book, I honestly did not feel like rereading this crap. I've heard many times and strongly believe just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Just because I can write every other word in italics doesn't mean I should. Just because J.R. Ward can do the whole hypen-overload-of-the-brain-to-make-something-hard-to-expain-easier-to-understand thing doesn't mean she should. Just because Nike, Van Hausan, Starbucks, Ralph Lauren (and who every else was plugged) wants you to promote their product in your book doesn't mean you should! Just because \"Black and Yellow\" contains those specific colors doesn't mean only Steerler's fans can like it. Ok, that went a little too far, but I want a red and gold song, damn it! As Ward would say, The Niners are doin' big thangs up in herr, off-the-chain-link kinda thangs, yo!Ok, I'm back . . .Don't believe me? Do you want more examples? No problem. Anyone with a copy can do so for themselves, here's how: Flip through your book and you will easily located groups of words separated by hyphens, meant to convey the attitude of a hip hooligan but ultimately makes them look like:Seth Green from Can't Hardly Wait Remember him? Chester Cheetah, roar!\nOr any of those Jersey Shore douchbags!\nThankfully J.R. Ward graciously allows us wait a year between books. That gives me time to unwind, and prepare myself for all of the obnoxiousness.Ok, but to get more on point. I loved the story. I can not wait to see what happens with Sissy and Jim, as well as how Adrian will cope going forward. I love a series that builds and expands with every book until you are compelled to read all you can get your greedy hands on hoping for a taste. I can't wait for the next installment, I am invested in this series and eagerly await more! For as wrong as J.R. Ward can be, she is so right when building a relationship. The characters HEA develops so beautifully, J.R. Ward should have 'wonderful romance guaranteed' tattooed on her arse, because it's the truth! Not to mention the fighting and gore scenes, so captivating! This could have easily been a 5+ Floozy book . . .That being said, I will not be the first in line for any future Fallen Angels books until J.R. Ward limits the \"ghetto\"ness. I relish books I don't have to dumb myself down to read, therefore, put them above books such as this.And as Veck would say: Wow. Yup that's all I have on that one.For this review and many more visit my blog Fairytale Floozy."}, {"userName": "Annie (Under the Covers Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2489554-annie-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "Veck is back and he\u2019s made a lasting impression on me!!We are first introduced to homicide detective Thomas \u201cVeck\u201d DelVecchio Jr. in Lover Unleashed as Jose de la Cruz\u2019s new partner. While I wasn\u2019t too keen on him in Lover Unleashed, I found that I loved him in Envy!What I love about JR Ward is the fact that she\u2019s able to create complicated running plots throughout her series. In one book, there are soo many character arcs and POVs that I\u2019m surprised that I\u2019m not confused by it all. But what Ward does in Lover Unleashed and then subsequently in Envy, the third instalment of the Fallen Angels series is beyond any words. At the beginning of Envy, Veck is in deep shit. Nursing a killer headache, he finds himself overlooking a body that looks to be mauled by an animal. He calls 911 to report the incident. But when questioned later about the events, he can\u2019t seem to remember anything at all without his head pounding like he\u2019s been hit across the noggin by a two-by-four. But the real problem is this aching suspicion that maybe he was the attacker...Enter Sophia Reilly, Veck\u2019s new assigned partner from Internal Affairs. Sparks are instantaneous between these two and it\u2019s no wonder! They have amazing chemistry and they have definitely become my favourite couple so far in the Fallen Angels series. What I loved most about Reilly was that fact that she was a straight-shooter, take-no-shit kind of woman who knows exactly what she wants. Sure, she has her confused moments where her head and her heart clash. But all in all, the girl\u2019s got something good between her two ears.Meanwhile, the battle between good and evil rages on. Devina won the last battle, but Jim and his boys certainly don\u2019t back down. I hope a certain angel returns because there is absolutely no way that\u2019s the end! Eddie must come back! I love him! The bathroom threesome scene was hawt, but didn\u2019t hold the usual sexiness that Ward brings. Poor Ad! I felt sorry for him before. Now, it\u2019s just heartbreaking.Did anyone else catch Throe\u2019s walk-on appearance towards the end of the book? I thought that was cool. Again, I\u2019m a sucker for cameos like that. Annnnnd what about the tip about a future soul in question? It\u2019s a familiar face so I\u2019m not sure how I feel about that just yet. I\u2019m trusting Ward though. Colin and Nigel deserve a mention. I loved their interactions with one another. Can\u2019t say that there\u2019s enough of it though. I like that Ward isn\u2019t afraid of exploring these avenues in her mainstream books. No need to hide behind novellas. And lastly, Jim and Sissy. While I still wonder about the age difference (Sissy is 19 and Jim is 40), I thought the ending with Sissy\u2019s mother, Susan was great. Both draining and hopeful, it brought me back to the earlier BDB times when Ward could break your heart with a few turn of events and then mend it back together with a few simple words. I loved it. Envy is my favourite of the Fallen Angels series so far. With a hero like Veck and an admirable heroine like Sophia, it was easy to fall in love along with them. But it\u2019s the war between heaven and hell that\u2019s got me jonesing for the next in the series.

Whatever Ward does, whatever twists and turns she puts within the plots that we as readers do not want to see or agree with, no matter what, the woman can create a great hero. Envy like the others in the series, has heros in abundance. Let's start with who is supposed to be our main man, Veck. Veck is a new Detective in the Caldwell PD. He is fighting his inner demons (literally) all the while fighting to stay away from, yet get closer to his new partner, Reilly. Veck was the none conventional tortured hero. The torture for Veck was not physical, it was living with the fact that his father was one of the most notorious serial killers ever. His crossroads was easy for Jim Heron to identify. And then onto Jim Heron. Oh Jim, I love him so much! He is the same smooth, tough, ass kicking angel that we've seen before with a little bit of softy thrown in. I have to say he is on my top ten favorite heros list. And finally Adrian. This guy is so fleshed out and open to us I feel like I can reach through the pages and hold him to make the hurt go away. And oh how I would love to. The weakness in Envy, I felt had to be the heroine, Sophia Reilly. She seemed just like a card board cut out to me. Almost like, Ward could have put any heroine from any book into her spot, made her a cop and viola! You have Veck's lady. Poor Veck. I felt he deserved someone better. I never learned why Reilly became a cop. I was never convinced why, with the exception of that he was hot, she fell for Veck. And most of all, all though she was a police officer, who are just supposed to be automatically tough as nails characters, she was an unbelievably gullible push over. It was so easy for her to be convinced that Veck was a bad guy. At that point I lost all faith in and respect for Reilly. Stand by your man dammit!Overall I was very satisfied with this new Fallen Angels installment. And once again I'm going to sulk and whine because I have to wait another year for the next one to come out. Lucky for us we were thrown a big bone as to who the next cross roads guy is.

I keep thinking - um, there are supposed to be at least four more books in the series right? I'm not sure what Ward is going to do with the rest of them because everyone seems to be losing their shit right here. Yes, I get these are supremely unhappy people, but Ward always feels the need to ratchet it up a notch with scene upon scene of really dysfunctional sex. I get these people are all so very dark, but seriously it's just making me queasy at this point.The plot, if you can call it one, meandered around quite a bit this time. Although this was DelVecchio's book he shared over half of it with a bunch of incomprehensible drama between Adrian/Eddie, Jim/Sissy/Devina and Nigel/Colin. And for the love of God does EVERYONE have to sound like one of the members of the black dagger brotherhood? It's fine for the brothers, but really, Ward has to have another voice in that head of hers somewhere. And I'm not taking about the fake 17th Century English accent she's saddled Nigel and Colin with either. I can tolerate it in the BDB books, but here, really it's beyond annoying.I finished this one because I liked DelVecchio and Reilly so much.

This heroine, Riley, started out fine but pissed me off later when she doesn't trust her man...to the point that he gets into really, really big trouble because she's such a suspicious *****. Veck, the hero, has both a good and an evil side that he has unknowingly kept in check his entire life. He's big and scary...and I LOVE big and scary. He's also very, very alone. He instantly feels this consuming attraction for Riley. He wants and needs a partner for life but holds back when he is partnered as a cop to his ultimate fantasy. The sex in Envy is OFF THE CHARTS!! Sexy, sexy, sexy! Cold shower worthy, even. Veck knows how to use his...everything. As always, Jim rules!!!! His devotion to Sissy nearly overrules his mission to save humanity. He meets her parents during this book, and Sissy's Mom describes him as \"The man with the destroyed eyes.\" Poor Jim! Thank goodness we all know that good will eventually prevail! Overall, this is by far the best book yet. I'm anxious for the next, though since the game is changing between \"the Creator,\" Devina, and Nigel, I'm wondering just how many books there will be now. Hmmm.... I listened to the audiobook, so I apologize for misspells.

I enjoyed reading it, but there were parts of the books that I did not enjoy as much as \"Vech's\" storyline. Also, I am finding this series is becoming formularic (sp?). One thing I did find interesting were the Brotherhood references through out the book. Also, JR has not lost her talent at writing great sex scenes for her characters. In fact, she does a great job in one scene leaving her characters and readers hanging on the edge. Will I continue to read this series? I think so, but I don't think I will be waiting with baited breath like I do with the BDB series."}, {"userName": "Mona", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6013607-mona", "userReview": "The love for these books, just keeps growing and growing..."}, {"userName": "Keri", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2335749-keri", "userReview": "WHAT an Awesome read!!!! 5+ stars!! I love this series. Our game continues of good vs evil or in this case Jim vs Devina. Now that Jim has discovered Devina's weakness for him, he is determined to exploit that to the fullest to win the game of keeping the souls of mankind and heaven out of the devil's hands. Jim's soul to save is Thomas \u201cVeck\u201d DelVecchio, Jr. We met Veck in a prior BDB book. His dad is a prolific serial killer and is due to be put to death in about a week. Everyone has been watching Veck to see if he is truly like his dad. Even he himself is unsure if he has turned into his dad, because he has a probable serial killer at his feet almost dead, but he has no memory of touching him. If you read BDB, you know what really happened, but Tom doesn't. Enter Sophia Reilly, an Internal Affairs officer. She has been assigned to the case. The problem is, she has to fight her attraction to Tom, as well as be unbiased about the investigation against him. (There is no way I could deny this sexy cop anything.) Unbeknownst to Tom, he has been visited by Devina. The only thing that he knows is that somebody seems to be haunting his house and when he throws a shadow he sees two shadows. Tom himself is fighting his attraction to Sophia. But with the craziness of his life, he is determined to keep her at a distance. Love, however, always finds a way and soon Veck and Sophia find themselves deeply involved. Meanwhile, Jim is trying to keep Veck out of Devina's clutches. Not knowing that Devina with her advance knowledge of the game has already planted her evilness deep in Tom. Now it becomes a race to find out if the light of love can show the path through the darkness. Devina continues to spread her evil as she works to separate Jim, Eddie and Adrian with dire consequences, as one angel gives up his life. I loved Veck and Sophia as a couple and the sexy times when they were together was absolutely hawt! I was at first disappointed in Sophia as she was too easily led to believe the worst of Tom, but forgave her in the end. Another sad part was Sissy and how some of that was resolved. Would love to know where we are headed with Jim and that situation. Love Nigel and Colin and was a little surprised at where that went. I love this series and can't wait for the next book. Team Jim for the WIN! :-)"}, {"userName": "\u00b8. \u2022 * \u00b0 *\u2767Gwendolyn\u2767\u00b0**\u2605\u00b0**\u2605", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9658212-gwendolyn", "userReview": "4.5 Envy Stars!

I just wish we had the half stars system working...Things I likedThis book was way better than the previous 2. Book 1 I almost didn't finish it. Book 2 was a bit better but I still could have go on without having read it and I wouldn't feel like I had regret it. NOW THIS BOOK was just superior. The plot was way more interesting, even though the characters were almost the same. The romance between the main character definitely exceeded my expectations. I really liked them, not a couple I will remember in a month or so but definitely one I don't regret reading about. Things were just so much clearer than in the previous books and the reading was just more easygoing and fluid than in the previous books. I just had a nice time reading it and I'm happy that with each book the series is getting better.I loved to see that Jim is becoming more powerful. I really do like that character. I just want to see him getting his HEA and not so much only saving others. I think it's time for him to be the one getting his HEA. I do like Devina as well, she's funny. I love her sessions with her therapist, LOL, hilarious. Now the things I couldn't stand and didn't like **NO spoilersI still believe there is just too much to improve on this series. A lot of things to work on. While it is definitely getting better I believe it's way too far on the path to become a series like BDB. psy-changeling, Demonica, IAD and others like those.1- I FREAKING HATE the idea of Angels being like the ASSHOLES described in here. Those Archangels are just LAME, how can anybody like them? Seriously, they are shallow to the core, superficial in a way that is disgusting, specially for being the creatures who rule the Heavens (not counting GOD, of course). Jim and the others are sacrificing their lives and giving everything they got on the War against evil while these st*pid Archangels play silly games and discuss the weather. I just can't like a series with such important characters being this HOLLOW. 2- Also I get that they are not suppose to interfere but if Devina breaks every freaking rule ever created why can't they blend them even a little? At least help Jim in any way? It's annoying to see the Devil do whatever \"she\" feels like doing while Jim has to make survive without any help.3- Also the \"let's save the soul of the next victim\" theme is getting a bit boring. It's always the same. A new soul to save is revealed and there they go to do just that with 2 possible outcomes. ALWAYS THE SAME. The plot is too predictable. Some small changes are made from book to book but on the big scheme things are just always the same...4- The 2 Angels who Travel with Jim grew big time on me after this installment. We did get to know them better, specially Adrian. This 3 are my fav characters and the story is never about them... I just wish we got more of them but with the HEA of the new selected soul we never get to read enough about them. Too many characters I love and the story is never focused on them and seems like it never will...I don't know, I guess just too many things still don't click ok with me. I still have faith for this series as this book was actually great, specially if you compare it with the previous ones."}, {"userName": "Mandi Schreiner", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2704703-mandi-schreiner", "userReview": "Wow - I liked it!!

Oh, how I love those angels. (Sigh) If you have read any of the previous books in this series you know that it's about good vs. evil. Literally. The war between Devina and Jim and his badass fallen angel sidekicks Eddie and Adrian. There are 7 deadly sins and 7 souls that will be tested when they reach their crossroads and hopefully they make the right choice. The story picks up right after the second book left off. Jim and his boys are trying to figure out who the next soul is going to be. No one wants to tell them and I don\u2019t think it's fair that Devina gets a head start by always knowing who the person is. Ugh! Good news is that Jim find a way and sets out to find this person. I don\u2019t agree with the method since its playing with the devil, but my boy has to do what he has to do in order to win. So, who is our next soul? It\u2019s the new detective in Caldwell PD, Thomas \u201cVeck\u201d DelVecchio, Jr.! You might remember him from Lover Unleashed. He has a little snippet there. Did I mention he's hot too? Oh, and Detective De La Cruz is back. Veck's dad is a famous serial killer and Veck is thinking that since he has his daddy's genes, he is just like him. But just because you have a short temper, it doesn\u2019t mean you are a serial killer. Or does it? Hmmm\u2026 When Veck is being suspected of brutally attacking, a killer, Internal affairs officer, Sophia Reilly is assigned to monitor Veck. Little does she know that she and Veck will end up mixing \"business with pleasure\" and a little bit more than she bargained for. But when Veck is at his \"crossroads\", will he choose the correct path, or let his ideas of him being just like his father get to him?I know some people disliked the way that J.R. Ward crossed some of the characters from BDB to The Fallen Angels series. Well, me personally, I thought it was brilliant. I am in love with both series and I just can't seem to get enough of both of them. Plus, who doesn\u2019t like to read about The Brothers in between our long year breaks? I know I do. I totally recommend Envy and if you haven't started reading this series, I strongly recommend you do so, like now."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4281149-laura", "userReview": "[Eddie's death (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Francesca the Fierce (Under the Covers Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3108364-francesca-the-fierce-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "Thomas DelVecchio Jr IS MINE!!!!!Wow, what a ride this book was! I love the fact that we first met Veck in Lover Unleashed but to tell you the truth I didn't think much of him then. He didn't excite me at all and I had no crazy major interest in reading this book, other than I wanted more Jim and Adrian and Eddy.Veck is the son of a notorious serial killer who is now serving a sentence in jail for crimes he committed long ago. He has lived his whole life with the stigma and he carries himself a certain way because of that. There's a whole cult of followers who adore his father.Of course now the time has come to battle for his soul, will Devina win this time? Or will it be a win for Team Herron?So I told you how awesome Veck is, but I actually liked Reilly too. She was a good other half for him and their chemistry was excellent. And don't get me started on their chemistry between the sheets. But I give Veck props for all that. He is amazing.Jim and Sissy... the whole thing is just sad! I hope that someone he can rescue her and they can be together, can that actually happen? How old was she again anyway? That would be cute.Nigel and Colin... interesting. I liked getting a bit more insight in what happens in the Angel world. It's not all roses up there either.Adrian and Eddy... I can't address this. My heart was broken and I couldn't stop the tears. I don't know where the plot will go from here on this.The threesome? It was sad. As in emotional and not in the good way. Empty. And it was meant to be that for the story.Brothers? Heck yeah!

Here are some thoughts though....I generally like Ward's style and the slang, product as nouns, and F-bombs work for her big bad-A males, but way too many characters here spout BDBisms - even the heroine has this 'voice'.It was nice that there wasn't so much of the torture, the book is still dark, just not so graphic. I really enjoyed the romance and had a great deal of sympathy for Veck with his shadowed soul.There are some emotional moments when Devina puts pieces of her evil plot into play - the aftermath of the divide and conquer between Jim and his fellow angels changes the dynamics for the future. Also I was so stressed out when the romance came to its peak and I was waiting for the 'something bad' that I knew was coming and it was just that bad - how come Devina gets to set everything up so far in advance and Jim has to play catch-up? I loved the moment when Jim gets to actually be an 'angel' at the end.Oh, I've read BDB but don't reread who is the 'grim reaper'?The two(sort of)-on-one in the bathroom (bathroom, ick! bathroom floor, even more ick!) didn't do it for me at all.The ending is very satisfying after the huge conflict that got stirred up.So that just leaves me with a couple thoughts for the future. I am really wondering how the next soul up at bat is going to work out. Are there going to be 7 books in the series, if so, there have to be more losses, the way the first was done was clever, but it will be a fine line to keep the series from being depressing if we are denied our interim HEAs. And as the battle goes forward is it going to be neck and neck? Or is Jim going to have to come from behind to save the day?"}, {"userName": "Riverina Romantics", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4031017-riverina-romantics", "userReview": "After losing my first attempt at writing this review, I will now try and retype all my witty comments \u2013 but you all know that my first version was better, Murphy\u2019s Law I\u2019m afraid.J. R Ward is a word smith beyond compare. Her writing is continuously flawless, convincing, unpredictable and thoroughly enjoyable. I would rate her in the top two authors I would inspire to write like (if I had a lick of talent). Her writing style is so acutely meshed with what I love in a book that I have seriously considered becoming one of those crazy stalker fans. I fantasise about sitting in her bushes and watching her sleep, but alas, I live in another country and this is one endeavour that I feel my husband won\u2019t approve of.Ok, back onto the topic at hand. ENVY.Envy is another exceptional read from J.R. and the best yet in the Fallen Angel series \u2013 in my opinion. Veck was yet another typical J.R. Ward hero. He was filled with grit, a sexy load of sarcasm and an adorable sweet side that was equally as attractive as his bad boy edge. He was GAWD DAMN FINE and Reilly was a great match for him. Sometimes you read a book and come away thinking that the heroine wasn\u2019t good enough, strong enough, smart enough, but I ended this book with a sigh and a warm fuzzy feeling that they would have a fantastic happily ever after. The twists and turns were wrenching out emotions that a lot of authors can\u2019t seem to get out of me. I was devastated at times, smiling to myself at others, but I was always left on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. Thoroughly enjoyed!!
