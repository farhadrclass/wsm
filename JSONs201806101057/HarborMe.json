I grabbed it, went downstairs and, coffee in hand, got to reading. I did nothing else until I finished. No food, no shower. I was absorbed.I'm not sure there's any such thing as a \"perfect\" book. But if there is, for this time in which we are living, for me, Harbor Me is perfect. From her first line - \"We think they took my papi.\" - to the lyricism of Woodson's writing, I was immediately drawn into the world of 6 kids. Haley, Holly, Amari, Esteban, Tiago, and Ashton, each have their own stories. Their stories are slowly, patiently revealed by Woodson as the kids spend an hour every Friday afternoon of school in ARTT - A Room to Talk. As their stories are revealed, each so different, they find friendship, community, self-worth, and a harbor. The story's ending is not what I thought it would be but, upon reflection, there's no other way it could have ended given our current political climate.Woodson pulls no punches. Topics that belong in every classroom - racism, immigration, police brutality - are all in this book, and they are all at a level that kids can understand, and about which they can develop both empathy critical thinking. I want to do nothing but teach this book in my classroom next year. I can't wait until it comes out so I can buy copies for my fellow teachers. Bravo, Ms. Woodson. Thank you for writing this."}, {"userName": "Julie Kirchner", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33400318-julie-kirchner", "userReview": "I started this book before bed and had to read it first thing this morning. Jackie Woodson spoke to my heart with this one. In this crazy, at times unrecognizable world we are living in, we need to harbor each other. We need to be there to listen, to protect, to care for and love each other. Harbor Me is the story of six students in 5/6th grade who are brought together because of their school related needs. Their teacher gives them a gift of uninterrupted time, on their own, once a week in a special room to share their stories. At first the kids aren\u2019t sure what to do with the ARTT (A Room To Talk) time. But as they get to know each other, as they open up and speak their truth, it becomes their safe space, a haven for their worried minds and hurting hearts. This is an important and beautiful book by the always amazing Jacqueline Woodson and published by the incredible Nancy Paulsen. What a gift to the middle grade world! Comes out in late August."}, {"userName": "Linda Gibbons", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24887449-linda-gibbons", "userReview": "I started reading this book expecting to love it, as I have loved everything I\u2019ve ever read by Jaqueline Woodson, I was not disappointed.Her combination of characters and their stories weaves together an amazing and timely tale of what life is like for so many young people in our country.

I was mesmerized by the characters and I can't get over how brilliant this story is. Haley's use of the recorder to remember her friends confessions was perfect.

It is honest and does an outstanding job of demonstrating how important peer relationships are to young people and how helpful they can be in order to work through personal problems.The school intervention specialist teacher sends her class of six students to a separate classroom for an hour on Friday afternoons to talk among themselves about issues that are bothering them in their daily life. There are no adults present to judge/guide/advise. Most important is that they must obey the \u201crules\u201d \u2013 including what may be the most important one: to be kind in their remarks. During the course of the year, the diverse group bonds, learning to open up, to trust, and to understand each other, forming potentially life-long friendships. It all begins with Esteban, who talks about his father who was recently taken to Florida by Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2013 \u201cWe think they took my papi.\u201d Other discussions center on racial profiling, bullying, poverty, experiencing the loss of a parent, what it is like having a father in prison, what it\u2019s like to have a disability, feeling bias due to language barriers, and first crushes.Woodson takes her characters on a roller coaster ride of highs and lows with great care and tenderness. They are respectful of each other, calling those out who \u201clabel\u201d someone. It is interesting that she never really identifies what the disabilities are that the students have, as only one expresses how difficult it is to sit still and focus. Readers will identify with all of them, as they may see themselves or their friends in the story, and weep as she poignantly walks this group through some of the tough life issues they have to deal with. The writing is lyric and musical in many places and the pacing is just right.Recommended for grades 5-8."}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82209656-jess", "userReview": "I received an ARC copy of this book. I thought this book did an amazing job approaching a variety of heavy topics that can be difficult for middle grade youth. In a Breakfast Club style approach, 6 youth in grades 5 and 6 of different cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds spend an hour once a week alone in a classroom to simply talk. Their teacher recognized that they had things they were aching to discuss, but would need the privacy and encouragement of a safe place to talk without adults around.Some of the topics these kids discuss include deportation of immigrants, police brutality, racial profiling, privilege, unfair aspects of the justice system, settlement/conquest, blended families, biracial identity, the stigma of learning disabilities, ESL, and bullying. These topics are discussed in varying degrees, offering different perspectives and beliefs. Woodson does an amazing job of broaching these topics in a relevant way that I feel middle grade readers can relate to in one way or another. There is room for debate and disagreement in the safe environment that the characters have cultivated."}, {"userName": "The Reading Countess", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2027269-the-reading-countess", "userReview": "Jacqueline Woodson\u2019s gift of words trick us into thinking the poetry oozing out of its pages at every turn magically appear, that we, too, can wield a mighty pen like a laden paintbrush and produce a masterpiece. Don\u2019t be fooled, dear reader. That is why she is who she is, and we are...well, not.Console yourself in the knowledge that she holds a mirror up to us, to society, to our students. We are lucky that we can tuck her books into the hands and hearts of our kids and whisper to them, \u201cYou are seen. You are not alone.\u201d Harbor Us will tie in nicely with our yearlong study of immigration, migrant farmers and Angel Island.This sweet story of six classmates, one uncle and a father locked far away is the pinnacle of Woodson\u2019s love letter to our kids.

Woodson\u2019s writing is so beautiful, so powerful, I wanted to savor each word, sentence, and paragraph. The story is told from the perspective of Haley, one of the six students who spends time in the ARTT room every Friday afternoon. Each student has a story that unfolds, and current events topics are discussed from the students\u2019 perspectives. I\u2019ve already preordered this book and I\u2019ll be using as a read aloud with my 5th grade students in the fall. I\u2019m looking forward to the discussion it\u2019s sure to bring on issues such as immigration and power."}, {"userName": "Kristin Crouch", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68240644-kristin-crouch", "userReview": "This book. Sooooo wonderful. Six kids in a classroom doing their thing, until their teacher gives them a weekly time to just talk. In a room, unsupervised. The result is raw, real, and wonderful. Each of the kids has their own struggles to navigate, and for the most part they're doing ok. But with the small group dynamic they build, they actually start to thrive. They become thinking, wondering, curious kids who look out for one another like they haven't before. They become a little family, sharing heartbreaks and joy. This book is Humanity 101.This will be a read aloud in my classroom as soon as it's published. Every classroom should have it, every child should read it, and every adult should read it as well.
