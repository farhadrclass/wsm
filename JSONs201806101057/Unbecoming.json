It wasn't Grace's fault that she was a bad apple. It wasn't anyone's fault, but it did explain a lot of her feelings, her secret thoughts. Being rotten was like being poor, but in your heart. Nothing to be done. You get what you get and you don't get upset.largely unsupervised, grace met riley graham when she was in the sixth grade and fell in love with him and his family, particularly with riley's mother. the grahams are well-off, educated, cultured, and very glamorous to grace. riley has three older brothers, and their house is full of noise, commotion, affection - everything grace wants. so she watches, and she learns, and she insinuates herself into the family, through the doorway of riley, and becomes the daughter mrs. riley always wanted. she struggles to reinvent herself because she doesn't want the grahams to see her for what she feels she is - a bad girl. You could be bad and still be a good girl, if you tried hard enough. She hadn't tried hard enough before.but now there is incentive to try. Riley made it easy for Grace to be good\u2026The Grahams had given her a chance, and she was eager to show them that she could be worthy of their love. They treated Grace as if she belonged to them, and so did Riley, and she devoted herself to earning her keep. She left her frantic, lonely childhood behind to become the Grahams' daughter and Riley's dream girl, silky haired and shyly smiling. She knew to go wherever she was wanted.she loses her virginity to riley when she is thirteen and moves in with the grahams at sixteen. and while she loves riley in her own way, it comes from a place of relief; love as rescue: She couldn't believe her luck that Riley wanted her, but she was grateful, and she loved him for it.but her real love is for mrs. graham. not in a sexual way, but in an equally desperate and hungering way. to be her daughter, to be her. she tries on mrs. graham's clothes and makeup and pretends to be her in the mirror.She sometimes fantasized a whole childhood as one of them - Grace Graham, the daughter Mrs. Graham had wanted - though she couldn't tell Riley this without making it sound as though she wished she were his sister.and all of this is encouraged by riley's family. their eventual marriage is a foregone conclusion, and they treat her like an adopted daughter - mr. graham calls grace \"your girl\" to his wife, and mrs. graham takes grace to buy her first bra, watches old movies curled up on the couch with her, and has her try on her own wedding dress, while she clutched at Grace like a long-awaited gift.and for this, grace will become what is expected of a daughter of the illustrious grahams.They might not have been able to change their natures, but she could hide hers. She would have to.and she will become what riley expects, as well.Later, when his friends had gone home, he told her that she'd embarrassed him. He framed his argument generously: \"Quit trying to be a guy,\" he said. \"You don't have to fake it. Just be yourself.\"She wasn't faking it, she started to explain. She was just - \"But I don't like you like that,\" he said.Just-be-yourself had its limits. She adapted to his vision. She liked that girl more than she had ever liked herself before anyway, so that was the self she became.she loves and admires riley, supports his artistic temperament and takes comfort in their shared history. she knows everything about him and she allows herself to be shadowed by him, where she can hide out in the role of that famous gone girl \"cool girl.\" and then she goes to new york. and everything changes.i realize i am going on and on and on here, so i will try to be brief, even though this is the most interesting part, to me. in new york, she is exposed to entirely new experiences that change her forever. most importantly, she finds that she is not so unusual in pretending to be someone she isn't. pasts are whitewashed, pretensions are accepted without question, and everything's about surface presentation. she learns the importance of clothing as camouflage, as armor. in addition to this, she discovers that some people are not only unashamed of their dark sides and impulses, but celebrate them, turning them into art. she is also exposed to true wealth.she studies art history and gets a job as an art appraiser's assistant. she lies about her past, saying that riley is studying at the sorbonne and that his mother is dying of breast cancer. she reinvents herself once again, transforming into a knowledgeable participant in the art scene and soaking it all in like a sponge. she still loves riley, but she begins to come into her own, no longer interested in hiding behind his familiar charisma. when she returns home for thanksgiving, she becomes that insufferable college student returning to what she sees as her quaint, provincial hometown. she criticizes riley's art as mere craftsmanship, technically competent, but lacking in vision. she spouts baudrillard at him, trying to inspire him into becoming edgy and important. grace's transition in new york makes me wince, but it is perfectly rendered. lots more stuff happens after this, but i've gone on way too long already. there's homecoming and heist and aftermath, romantic entanglements, grace getting herself into increasingly horrible situations which she endures, dead-eyed, and a pretty satisfying little fillip of a coda. as a character study, this is really successful. i was much less interested in the heist itself (although it was very clever) and everything that happened once she became julie. but this is an author i will definitely keep an eye on, because the things she does well she does very very well, and i think she has a lot more in her."}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2947323-dianne", "userReview": "I don't know what to make of this book or how to describe it. I thought it was a heist thriller, but it's a lot more complicated than that. It's a mixture of a thriller, a psychological character study and a family drama. Truthfully, it's an uneasy marriage of the three; I am not quite sure Scherm successfully pulled it off. I loved it at first and couldn't tear myself away, but it slowly wore me down. By the end, I just wanted to be done with the book and the characters. Blah blah blah....end this...PLEASE.

Shame that I\u2019m not one for a heist novel because the story\u2019s founding ideas are solid; its flashy plot, however, is not. What we have is a love story. Grace has a childhood sweetheart whom she intends to love forever until her growing up reveals different, contradictory intentions. She\u2019s faced with a question I ask myself a lot lately: at what age can we finally assume that the person we are is mostly the person we are going to be? And whose decision is it? That is, who decides who we are going to be? Us? Someone else? The blind, unfeeling universe? Grace learns that when whoever that whomever is makes his decision, it\u2019s impossible to bridge the gap. Gone are the days of one leg firmly sunk in the sands of childhood, the other leg tentatively stepping toward adulthood; Grace is pushed along whether she likes it or not. She tries, like any normal human being, to fight what she\u2019s becoming. And that\u2019s where we get the heist, the much touted thriller element crying out to prospective readers on the back cover. That\u2019s also where the story begins to fail. Once Grace\u2019s largely plotless but entirely typical personal metamorphosis disappears under piles of blueprints, printouts from art auction house websites, and million dollar paintings, the story moves too quickly and loses itself. In life climaxes tend to happen quickly; in books climaxes must unwind slowly and carefully or else the reader\u2019s patience is only briefly, perfunctorily rewarded. The crazy fast plot befuddles character motivations. Where Grace was once recognizable, indeed pitiable, she is now confusing, unrealistic, and unsympathetic. Author Rebecca Scherm tries to say some great things in Unbecoming, but her choice to pursue a commercial thriller plot foils her attempt. Grace\u2019s love and growing up are justifiably convoluted; unfortunately the heist plot is too."}, {"userName": "Rob Slaven", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14011226-rob-slaven", "userReview": "As is very almost always the case, I received this book free in exchange for a review. Despite the kindness of receiving a free book I'm absolutely candid about the book because I want everyone to know what they're getting as much as I hope to when I'm shopping.The nutshell view of this book is that is is largely a character sketch of a kleptomaniac. The narrative is inverted, starting in the center and winding backwards through the events that led up to the beginning. Then with about 1/3 of the book remaining the narrative begins to proceed forward.To the positive side, the novel is written in a very literary style. The author's description is vivid and she paints a delightful picture of person and place. She takes two very different worlds and pushes them together in a quite unique way. To the negative, the characters and the story are profoundly flat. The protagonist is making the same foolish mistakes at the end that she did when she started out. The story takes what seems like a profoundly long time to go a very shot distance. As descriptive as the text is when you come to the end one wonders why all the bother in the first place. In summary, it took a lot of concentration to bear with this much text on so little actual content and in the end I felt I'd rather wasted my time. -- Rob SlavenFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/tatteredthread/Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile...YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/RobSlave...WordPress: https://tthread.wordpress.com/"}, {"userName": "Snotchocheez", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1899836-snotchocheez", "userReview": "2.5 starsRebecca Scherm's debut novel  Unbecoming cannot escape comparison to Donna Tartt's Pulitzer Prize winner  The Goldfinch, with the young, morally confused protagonists, the antique restoration/art heist/forgery plot, and the circumnavigated settings (Paris by way of NYC and Garland, Tennessee). Whether a coincidence or by design, it almost seems like a calculated effort by Ms. Scherm to replicate Ms. Tartt's success.That's not the reason for my middling rating, though. While I liked  The Goldfinch plenty, there was ample opportunity to pare the bloat and still be left with a taut thriller. It seemed upon first impression that's what Ms. Scherm was going for here. The story was taut, but completely lacked any sense of suspense. Absent any twists, the reader is left with a convoluted character study that strained credulity.We begin with Grace (reinventing herself as Julie) in Paris, restoring antiques for a less-than-scrupulous back-alley outfit, pondering the imminent release from prison of two of her closest male friends, incarcerated for the robbery of a local museum back in her home town of Garland, Tennessee, a heist that was entirely conceived by Grace. The bulk of the novel tells Grace's story in her formative years growing up with her first love Riley and his best friend Alls(ton) and what led these otherwise intelligent kids down the path of a life of crime. The blurb's comparison to Gillian Flynn does this novel a huge disservice. You expect a suspensful thriller, but Ms. Scherm isn't that kind of writer, and it' becomes clear that isn't where she was going with this anyway. Still, that expectation loomed in the back in my mind that there was going to be some kind of payoff at the end, some kind of.shocking denouement to make Grace's rather tepid character study worthwhile. Her behavior was certainly unbecoming from what you'd expect an aspiring Art History major to be, but novel-worthy? Sorta-kinda, but ultimately, not really."}, {"userName": "Taryn Pierson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13977687-taryn-pierson", "userReview": "I may need to seek out more heist novels, because I ate up Unbecoming like it was dessert. Grace is an American living in Paris, working in antiques repair. Her coworkers know her as Julie from California, but she's actually from Garland, Tennessee. Back home, two men are being paroled after serving time for a crime Grace masterminded.It's only a matter of time before they catch up to her.Scherm builds suspense by telling Grace's story out of order, flashing between her calm-on-the-outside life in Paris and her years growing up in Garland. Without the depth of insight into Grace's character, this would have been a light, fun, surface-level read, and I would have enjoyed the pants off it. Instead, I got something even better. I was fascinated by this regular girl turned career criminal and became totally tangled up in the lies she tells and the ways she justifies them to herself. It takes some authorial sleight of hand to convince a goody-goody like me to root for the bad guy, but that's exactly what I found myself doing with Grace. I wanted her to get away with everything, and I'm not even sure why. I can't say I identified with her, or felt empathy for her, or even particularly liked her. But she was incredibly compelling. I also loved peeking over her shoulder into the world of high-dollar antiques\u2014a topic I've never been remotely interested in, but which grew glamorous and irresistibly shiny through Grace's discerning eyes. Unbecoming is an unputdownable pleasure from start to finish, dark and fun at the same time.More book recommendations by me at www.readingwithhippos.com"}, {"userName": "Cathie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7399091-cathie", "userReview": "It has been a while that I have read a novel such as this.Grace takes us on her journey as she leaves Garland Tennessee and heads to New York and Prague, and then transforms herself as Julie from California residing in Paris.She of course leaves more than just her hometown.

I did enjoy this book however, and towards the end of the story I could not put the book down. The title is concise and suits the story of Grace perfectly. At some points I sympathized with Grace and really understood the situations she was dealing with, including her relationship issues and feelings of being trapped in a small town and wanting to get out into the world (and finally getting out to pursue a college education.) At other points, I felt more animosity towards Grace, and found myself unable to understand the decisions she was making. I think that's part of what makes the character of Grace so interesting: the reader can commiserate with her as she gets herself into increasingly questionable situations, yet just as easily pass judgment on her as the lies and delusions pile up. She is relatable and simultaneously insincere. Grace's character reflects one or more aspects of our own personas, and regardless of the choices she makes for herself, it is easy to either picture yourself in her shoes or even remember a time when you dealt with something similar. Grace's circumstances are unfortunate, and it is both intriguing and heart-breaking to find out where she ends up, the consequences she is left to face, and how the ones she once considered closest to her will deal with the regrettable mess she leaves behind."}, {"userName": "Stuti (Turmeric isn't your friend.

Unbecoming A Novel tries to get across as a novel of grandiose, I think, but inside is a story in complete contrast. The characters try to come off as players in the major leagues, but their dynamics are simpler, motivations clearer than you'd expect. There's a twisted sort of homeliness,- or longing for it - as opposed to mind-fucks and coziness, that worked for me. It's where the genius lies.The story is split into two parts, past and present. For a greater part of the novel, 'present' sets up only the mental and physical surrounding of Julie as stories, backgrounds, histories and action opens up in the 'past' chapters in the life of Grace. There's a ring of contrariness that consecutive chapters set up because of the difference in what time of the same character - Julie actually being Grace - that actually mitigates any sort of disorientation that comes from reading stories written in such manner.The first lie Grace ever told Hanna was her name.Suspense builds up in one part while there's the lull of relatively normal life and unwarranted anticipation born of guilt that is a part of it. When we are finally done with the past and we get to what was behind the beginning of the story, the 'present' chapters come to the forefront and everything materializes. Grace was a lonely, neglected girl (aren't they all?) when she fell in love with Riley. Riley opened the gate for her to his family - his mother, Mrs Graham. Slowly, this love evolves and changes and becomes confused. It's not love for Riley anymore but the sense of belonging and family that being with him brings about. She becomes the daughter Mrs Graham never had. Mrs Graham is the kind of mother Grace never had. And as this childhood love for Riley morphs, as she falls for another, the harder she tries to hold on, doing whatever to keep a hold of/on him. There is Alls, the biggest temptation. And she realizes that Mrs Graham may not be that mother at all.Fast forward three years, Julie lives in Paris while the two main characters of her childhood - Riley, her husband, and his best friend, her lover, Alls - are finally let out on parole. Grace goes through many changes during the course of her story, on the way to becoming Julie. There are precursors obvious enough but the changes are gradual processes that change her perception, what she sees and was unwilling to see before. Only one thing is constant, despite what may come: her longing to be Mrs Graham's, truly. And these transformations of characters were the bestest thing of all.So... this is a basic love triangle kind of story, in a way since the kinds of love differ, which leads to disastrous consequences.Yet for me, consequences and everything weren't the important part. There are three characters - Grace, Alls, Hanna - and the lengths one may go to fool oneself. There are nuances to them but they're still actually simple, and by that I don't mean lacking in anything. They're all different and as unhinged, fucked-up or psychotic at least the first two try to be, their motivations are easy to figure out and understand. Yet that causes intrigue all of its own.Unbecoming A Novel is kind of psychological in its own way, but more than that, it's a character study. If you can get into Grace, you will enjoy this story, simple as that. But there are other aspects to consider: Scherm's writing is grrrr-reat. I mean, it's totally palatable but maintains a kind of class and insight. It doesn't exactly resonate but comes close to it. The only thing that miffed me a bit was the turn that the story took towards the end. It seemed too easy, too wonderful but comes along a conclusion rife with bitterness and want, ending it all on a purr-fect note. I'm still miffed, though.But yay for this book! I'd LOVE it if you LOVE this book. It's a intriguing, fantastic book, just sizzling in anticipation of your readership. Ohh do read it! Even if you slightly like it, I won't hate you.

It has the pace and slowly unveiling plot of both books, with a questionable female narrator and the subject of art. I think people who were fans of either of those books would enjoy this one. I actually enjoyed the little details about art restoration, art heist, etc., and found myself looking for more information about some of the famous art thieves mentioned.

The coming-of-age part of the story was strongest. That time in life when you are still forming is always such a compelling read. As an only child I identified with Grace and Alls who both wanted the type of family and security that Riley had in spades. I get it. As a child I loved spending time with my friends who had big families. The chaos, the noise, the carpools, the mess. Our house was generally quiet and orderly. My parents worked. It was way more fun to be in the midst of chaos. Grace came from a home of benign neglect and Alls had an alcoholic father. Both of them longed for a nurturing environment and it shaped them. It shaped their actions. And that is where this story shines. As a character study. The rest has its moments but my favorite parts were during those early years.

Unbecoming comes wrapped up in all sorts of \"hints\" and \"echoes\": Hitchcock (well, one of his movies is mentioned a couple of times), Highsmith (I do see the connection between Tom Ripley and Grace), and Gillian Flynn, who's currently flavor of the month. Perhaps I should've heeded my inner alarm when I saw Flynn's name because I couldn't get past the first twenty-five pages of Gone Girl. I didn't pay attention; however, and I had to force myself to finish this book.Unbecoming is also labeled a \"heist novel,\" but it isn't really. The robbery is alluded to many times, but it's never really talked about in any detail until the end of the book. Instead almost the entire novel is a very slow and meticulous look into the metamorphosis of Grace. Grace, who started out as a lonely but very likable child looking to be loved, to be a part of a family. As the years pass, she becomes enmeshed in the life of her chosen family, becoming chameleon-like in an attempt to be accepted. Most of Grace's attempts to belong involve some sort of lying or deception, and although I'm the farthest thing from being an ultra-conservative moralist, I just couldn't empathize with her. Neither could I empathize with Riley, since he came from a family with a bit of money and he coasted through his life without really thinking about anything very much-- especially consequences. The only character I could muster up some empathy for was Alls, the boy with the father everyone in town whispered about, the boy who had no money and had to work for every single thing he had. I could empathize with Alls, but I never grew to like him.The incredibly slow pace of the novel and its characters were killers for me, but there were things I liked about Unbecoming. For me the book came to life whenever Scherm described the work Grace did to restore items in the shop in Paris. Both the items she worked on and Grace herself seemed to glow, and I swiftly began to look forward to these scenes. I also appreciated the very intricate plotting of the book, which was skillful even if I didn't like the story. Grace is also one of the most nuanced characters I've encountered in a long time. It's just a shame that I didn't like her and grew tired of her slow unveiling.All in all, Unbecoming just wasn't my cup of tea, but that certainly doesn't mean that it can't be yours."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5476515-amanda", "userReview": "Probably more like 3.5 but just because it got off to a really slow start and because I wanted to punch the narrator in the face a couple of times.

I think the underlying foundation throughout the whole storyline is about love and what it is and how it means different things to different people. Don't get me wrong, there were some jaw dropping moments that caught me off guard, and if you are a fan of Donna Tartt's The Goldfinch you will find many similarity's from the misguided protags, the theft, the travel and the similarity stemming from childhood insecurities that helps shape who they became as adults.

These novels let me indulge in the fantasy that art objects are not just the stuff of a college major that will render you unemployable; they are instead the objects of international criminal intrigue! Unfortunately, Scherm's novel did not impress me as a major or memorable contribution to the genre. The plot is straightforward: Grace is a teenager benignly neglected by her middle-class parents in her small-town Tennessee community. She is all-but-adopted by the more aristocratic family of her high school boyfriend Riley. By age 17, Grace has acquired an improbable expertise in antiques. She, Riley, and their quasi-delinquent friend Allston steal a painting and some other objects from from a local historical site. The boys are caught and serve a three-year prison term, but Grace absconds with the painting to Europe, sells it, loses the money, assumes a false identity, starts work in a shop that restores antiques. The boys are released from prison and she worries about being unmasked. The prose is competent, sometimes surprising and beautiful. Take this description of an antique box Grace wants to restore: \"She would have to teach herself [the artist's] gilding process in order to convincingly fill the chips and scratches. She relished every injury, running her fingers very lightly over them as if they were sensitive bruises. Each one was a chance. She would repair them all.\" Not bad, right? Even with that split infinitive? But here and throughout the novel, the sensitivity and attention lavished on objects has to substitute for full characterization. Grace falls in love twice in this novel; neither time does the narrative provide any sense of what is compelling about either man. Nor does it make Grace seem enticing enough to justify the criminal lengths to which these men are willing to go for her. It offers no insight into the psychological strain that might be caused by shedding one's nationality, identity, and acquaintances and expatriating to a different country. The \"bruises\" on that gilded box are the closest we get to the topography of Grace's emotional life. After three years--by which time Grace has reached the ancient age of 21 or 22--she has unconvincingly acquired a world-weary sang-froid, as well as the expertise of a virtuosic antiques restorer. If Scherm took this conceit all the way, it could work beautifully. If Grace were actually a sociopath--someone whose emotional life is internally dead, but manifests itself in the objects to which she ministers--then the novel could work. That's sort of what happens in Highsmith's novels: the desert of Ripley's interior is belied by the opulence of his decadent material life. But instead, the narrative gives us meager, anemic explanations for Grace's choices and transformations. Her parents never loved her enough, so she wanted the approval of her boyfriend's mom. She is emotionally crippled in college because she is still dating her middle-school boyfriend. Her unrealized passion for Allston has sustained her throughout her secret life. These rationales ring hollow and trite. All of that said, I read this book in one night. The plot was intriguing enough; the pacing was good; the prose was mostly precise and sometimes surprising in the best ways. The premise of artistic restoration and forgery as an allegory of human deception has enormous potential. But finally, the sentence that sticks with me most--and not for the right reasons--is this one, in which Grace describes both a teapot she has imperfectly restored and her own assumed identity: \"[S]he had never forgotten the truth. She'd told shoddy lies. The story was pale and underdeveloped and looked like the imposter it was.\" Alas, after a full reading, that sentence becomes a meta-commentary on Unbecoming.

It was another ARC picked up at my husband's work. I think the cover drew me in. It is a book with an appropriate title. It is about a young woman named Grace, and her unbecoming. Unbecoming herself, unbecoming the false presentation of herself to the world, and unbecoming people's expectations of her. It is written in different chunks of time, separated by the location. I Garland. II New York. III Paris. Each location has a distinct feel to it, and you learn more about Grace and her story through the different locations of her life. I went into this book not knowing anything about it, and I think that was the way to do it. While it felt like a slow burn to the end, there were so many subplots to follow that each part of the book felt like its own story. I wasn't blown away with the writing or the story, but I liked the characters and I liked how real it felt. This was my favorite part of the whole book, I think: Outside, she and Alls walked a yard apart, Alls following Grace to the subway, though she wasn't certain exactly where the nearest station was. Almost no one else was out on the Upper East Side. A man in a trench coat, his face tight and shiny, wove unsteadily down the sidewalk behind them like a toddler learning to walk. \"Hey Nebraska,\" he called. \"Nebraska, you slut.\" Alls grimaced and took her arm, and they walked faster. \"I know what those slutty boots mean, Nebraska. Is that where you're from? Or fucking Ohio?\" Grace stopped and turned around. \"Get the fuck away from me.\" The man laughed to himself and then pulled out his cell phone, as though he'd forgotten that Alls and Grace were standing there and that he had been harassing her. He mashed some buttons and groaned. \"You done, man?\" Alls said. \"You need to turn around, go the other way now.\" The man stepped forward, casually, easily. \"Who's this, your brother? Your brother come up from the farm?\" \"I told you to get back from me,\" Grace warned. \"I'll tongue-fuck you till you can't breathe,\" he slurred quietly. \"In your little boots.\" He stepped into the light from a streetlamp and seemed to wilt there, his body slumping forward. Grace grabbed Alls's elbow and they stomped down the sidewalk, Grace's heels hitting the concrete hard enough to send shocks up through her shins, her thighs, into her hips. \"Has that ever happened before?\" \"I'm not usually out so late.\" Usually she was on the phone with Riley by now. Boys never seemed stupider than when they were surprised by the bad behavior of other men."}, {"userName": "Lacey", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2006264-lacey", "userReview": "*I won this book through goodreads' first reads.This is the most thoroughly bland book I've read in a long time. It has a lot of potential, and it tries really hard but in the end, for me, it's just . . . bland. The concept is good, the writing is more than adequate, the characters are believable . . . but it just doesn't quite work for me. Perhaps it's the almost entirely inaccurate description that lead me to enter the giveaway in the first place - this book is being billed as a thrilling heist novel, but it opens with heist-er who got away nervously reading about how the heist-ers who didn't get away are getting out of prison. And while we do see the crime happen eventually, since it's told in flashback and we already know the end, the suspense and wondering if they will pull it off is killed.So the thrilling part is dead, what about the coming-of-age story? That didn't really work for me either. Grace starts as a pre-teen girl who tries to be the girl the people she's with want her to be, whatever that group happens to be at the moment. By the end she's the 25-year-old who succeeds at being the girl she wants the people she's with to think she is in order to get away with whatever she happens to want to get away with. Personally, I don't see a lot of growth or change in that. She is hardly a femme fatale, even if the first page you come upon inside the cover is a letter from the vice president of the publishing company telling you you're about to read the story of the making of one.And then there's the ending. After a brief chapter or two of suspense when the flashback story catches up to the present we skip ahead to an epilogue where everything is, perhaps not ideal, but the life Grace has chosen is working out perfectly. Everything goes flawlessly, she's happy as a clam and has everything, more or less, that she wants. It's not a picture perfect ending the way the final scene of \"A Christmas Carol\" is, but it's exactly how Grace would have imagined it to be - no challenges, no possibility of things going wrong. It's all wrapped up with a perfect, shiny bow - even if the bow is not in the prettiest color. I don't like endings like that 95% of the books I read, and it was absolutely the wrong one for this book. On the other hand, the epilogue was the only part of the book where I felt any emotion other than \"neutral\" . . . even if it was a negative one. So that took it from three down to two stars. So close . . ."}, {"userName": "Footprints", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36196608-footprints", "userReview": "A gritty novel with an ambitious development of unlikeable (unbecoming?) characters.

Tho\u2019 Rebecca Scherm cannot match Donna Tartt\u2019s sweep, scope, & mastery of prose & pathos, the sheer intensity of Unbecoming simply carried me away. I was continually on edge with concern for Grace, and identified totally with her. Like The Goldfinch, Unbecoming is based on the parallel between authenticity in life & in art. Grace illustrates one of my favorite themes in literature, the character who transforms herself into someone else - like Cassie Maddox/Lexie Madison in Tana French\u2019s The Likeness. Grace indeed reminded me very much of the original Lexie, the murder victim, of The Likeness. Without ever quite intending to do it, Grace began her formation as a criminal mastermind while she was still a teenager in Tennessee. But not only is Unbecoming a marvelous caper story, it also depicts relationships superbly & poignantly. Grace\u2019s new identity comes @ a high price, particularly in betraying a family who virtually adopted her & loved her, & their son Riley who was both her earliest BF & later secret husband.There is another character whom I originally found odious but came to admire. When you get betrayed & screwed over by a bad girl you can go all to pieces - like the pathetic Nick in Gone Girl - or you can be big & bad enough & smart enough to go out & get back what you deserve. Without telling how this story ends, I\u2019ll simply say that it was completely satisfying both emotionally & artistically.

This book is what\u00a0The Talented Mr. Ripley should have been. In both books, the main character is something of an anti-hero, longing to have a life that's not theirs so desperately that they'll do anything to achieve it. The difference in the two stories is that\u00a0Rebecca Scherm actually managed to make her character relatable. When reading The Talented Mr. Ripley, I never felt any particular sympathy for Ripley because I couldn't understand his motivations. Although Grace wasn't always (or ever, really) someone I'd like to be friends with, I ached for the absence of both affluence and affection in her childhood. This made her drive to preserve a life where she had those things\u00a0at any cost far more understandable.The pacing of this story is one aspect which did remind me very much of\u00a0The Talented Mr. Ripley. The tension didn't make me want to rush through the book, desperate to find out what happened next, but there was a nice, slow simmer of curiosity throughout. I do sometimes enjoy more fast-paced books, but the pacing of this book was just right for this story and it was fascinating watching how everything played out. I also have to commend this book for starring a fantastic female anti-hero, which is something I would love to see more of. Despite the fact that I thought this blew\u00a0The Talented Mr. Ripley out of the water, I would recommend this to fans of that book based on the similarities and also to anyone who likes mysteries with a slow build of tension and/or complex female characters.This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey."}, {"userName": "Chaitra", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9086236-chaitra", "userReview": "As a character study of a desperate loner child who wants in with a huge family anyway she can, it's a wonderful book. Grace is not an only child, but for a long time she had no siblings. When they did come, her parents neglect her for her adorable siblings, and it's as if she's still an only child. She craves what Riley has, Riley who loves her unconditionally. She loves him too, but she loves his family more. Her problem is that she thinks she is a bad girl, but for the family, she will try and be the good girl. She almost succeeds, but doesn't because the heart wants what it wants. Which is where I felt the book lost the plot a tiny bit. This is a book that is divided in time and place. It starts off with a Grace faking it in Paris, after something went wrong in small town, Tennessee. She's all alone, working in a slightly shady antiques repair business for a mere pittance. She's very good, but she also doesn't have a visa, and she's waiting for her past to catch up to her. The past, understandably sordid, is spoken of in flashbacks. Ultimately, it does catch up to her, but not in a way she thought of. Unlike most reviewers, I loved the Grace in Paris. I guess the minutiae of repairing antiques appealed to me. I liked Grace in the US as well, but I somehow didn't care for the both of them together. Which is why I've rated this slightly lower than I would have liked to, I didn't think it hung together very well. But it's well written, it kept me turning the pages, and I liked how it ended. P.S.: I'm an only child, both my parents worked, but I have never, ever wished for a sibling or for a larger family. Not a single time.
