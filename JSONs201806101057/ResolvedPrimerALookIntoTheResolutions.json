I have read Orrin's book Resolved twice now and this book is great if you want a quick overview of the 13 resolutions for life. Great principles that every human should study if they want to live a happy more meaningful life. Great principles that I will be able to pass onto my children. This book and the more in depth Resolved are must reads!"}, {"userName": "Aaron Crim", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16991687-aaron-crim", "userReview": "Loved this condensed version.

I'd say more so due to the brevity, it is more impactful. If you are doing the 13 week program to improve on your 13 resolutions, this is a great companion to use in addition to the full Resolved book."}, {"userName": "Nicholas Nighbor", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14535517-nicholas-nighbor", "userReview": "This is such a concise version of the original full version.
