At times, I thought that her writing was a little too abstract, so sections where she seemed to be trying to give the characters additional complexity instead fell somewhat flat. Nonetheless, I greatly enjoyed the two main characters and absolutely adored Ruark!! ::sigh:: Great hero and the way he's drawn to Rose and the feelings he has would make any woman swoon, lol. Rose was, oddly enough, a little more opaque and harder to read (I say \"oddly enough,\" because if that ever happens with one of the main characters, it's usually the hero and not the heroine). The tension between the two of them was wonderful and though I might have liked a little more detail in Thomas' writing style, the reader definitely feels the sparks!There were a few different subplots and mysteries going on, all of which kept the story moving and entertaining. I will say, however, that they were all wrapped up far too quickly in just a few pages at the end (and included a surprise which I found unnecessary).Would definitely recommend it though, and I'm sure that I will reread it at some point in the future."}, {"userName": "Zoe", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6168938-zoe", "userReview": "ahhhhh another great couple with a less than great story. Ruark and Rose are great together. Melody Thomas seems to have a knack for creating great chemistry between lead characters and that alone made the reading experience a positive one. For the first 70% of the story this book had me at my throat, and then once they got married........well, I was bored. Ruark was a Scots. Rose was the daughter of Ruark's English enemy. This is the age-old Scotland vs England plot but the book doesn't really read like a highland story. The setting was the 18th century. The Scottish/English feud had taken on a different flavor. But somehow this book reads medieval, which does not match the time period at all. That aside, I cannot say anything against Ruark and Rose. They had chemistry together. And that is no small feat. I liked Rose a lot, she had the impossible position but never once did she get hysterical or vengeful/prideful. Ruark and Rose did not fight the attraction for long but they were not verbal about their affections toward each other. So they were kind to each other without really acknowledging their emotional attachments. Once they got married, I had the feeling that the story did not really know where to go. So Ruark managed to save Rose from her father without sacrificing his half brother. He brought her back to his place and in the last 30% we are reading about how Rose settled in with Ruark's family and they were often separated. I found this part extremely boring and the pace was slow. If I did not like Ruark and Rose as much as I did, I would have stopped reading then. It seems to me that Melody Thomas can write really compelling characters. I love the chemistry she creates for her lead characters. But I wish she would give them better stories, which allow the readers to see their growing affections, their struggles and sacrifices and their leaps of faith in the final hour. Another 3 star read it is."}, {"userName": "Helena", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3750733-helena", "userReview": "Melody Thomas\u2019s command of the Scottish Highlands, its people and traditions shines through in this novel packed with passion, clashing clans and a touch of Arthurian magic.\u2018Claimed by a Scottish Lord,\u2019 is a multi-layered novel set in 1755 that brings the reader from behind the walls of an abbey across the Scottish hinterlands to the gates of a magnificent castle. This sweeping story weaves together the lives of Rose Lancaster with the vengeful Lord of Roxburghe, Ruark Kerr with warring borderland clans.Kerr a.k.a. the Black Dragon, has returned to his Scottish homeland seeking a trade for the life of his young brother, Jamie. Imprisoned by his hated enemy, Lord Hereford uses Jamie to draw Roxburghe back from the sea to extort payment and retribution for his late father\u2019s misdeeds.Rose unwittingly becomes a pawn in Kerr\u2019s plan to trade her for his brother\u2019s life which begins an interesting series of plot twists perfectly executed. Raised as an orphan at Hope Abbey, with an intellectual bent for legends and ciphers, Lancaster is no less astute or confident as a sheltered woman (a refreshing turn) as she battles Kerr across the countryside toward the planned exchange. Just prior to being abducted by Kerr, she comes upon a silver ring that is promptly appropriated by the laird who refuses to relinquish it until Rose divulges her secrets.Spirited yet burdened by her past, she is the alter ego and match to Kerr\u2019s battle-weary, troubled soul. While his captive, Rose fights with the prowess of a trained knight and forces a battle-hardened Kerr to grudgingly come to view her in a different light as the two forge a bond and mutual respect that blossoms into a meaningful partnership. The book\u2019s tempo is just right with great character arcs and winning dialogue to carry the reader along further revealing conflict and a gist of things to come. At Roxburghe Estate, Rose is plunged into a myriad of mayhem stemming from her bloodline, Kerr\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e - now his step-mother - and growing feelings between Ruark and Rose as tension builds among the clans with the deadline looming for the prisoner trade.Several clever pivotal moments and individuals masquerading throughout the tale supply an inevitable sense of \u2018all is not as it seems\u2019 to keep the reader guessing and turning the pages.Readers will thoroughly enjoy the complex characters and rich plot that makes \u2018Claimed by a Scottish Lord\u2019 a compelling read that is as fulfilling as it is satisfying."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2512748-sarah", "userReview": "I'm actually not sure how to review this book so I am going to ramble, forgive me.I really enjoyed the basics of this book. Even though the hero kidnaps the heroine, he is very upfront about his reasons for his actions. The reason he gives, rescuing his 12 year old brother, is very noble, and the heroine actually understands his motivation. It was the honesty between the characters that I found refreshing. She wasn't some pea-brained, overly emotional captive and he was truly bothered by his very non-noble treatment of her. He explained why he would ransom her to his brother's captive, and she told him she understood but had no desire to go back and would try to escape. Here's where I lose my thread though. Admittedly there were times I was reading when I couldn't focus entirely on the book, but I found there were numerous times in the book that I didn't understand why she went from laughing to mad. Or he would lower his voice to apologize to her then his next sentence would be said dispassionately. And even more times, I would be reading and the characters would move suddenly without me knowing how. For example, at one point they are both standing beside the horse, then he's galloping away, and then he is reaching for her hand. It made it difficult to flow into the story because I had to keep backtracking to figure out how or where or why.Not very helpful, I know, but I really think this book suffered from bad editing because the writing in itself was enjoyable if a bit stuttered. I enjoy her books, and will continue to read her. If her next book is the same then I have my answer, and will probably not read another one."}, {"userName": "Ns", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3040548-ns", "userReview": "Claimed by a Scottish Lord started slowly. It took awhile for the characters to develop and for the plot to take off, but the ending was satisfying. The characters are strong and well-matched but yet they also lacked excitement. Rose is beautiful, intelligent and willful. She always finds the best in people and is a healer, both spiritually and physically. Her compassionate nature attracts wounded or needy people in life, which she welcomes fully. It is no wonder she is drawn to Ruark Kerr, as he is to her. Ruark is a wounded hero despite the ferocity and strength he shows, which Rose senses right away. There is a vulnerability and humanity in him. He is not the cold-hearted warrior that he is made out to be. When Ruark takes Rose hostage in order to exchange her life for his younger brother, he does not expect to fall in love with her but he does. For Rose, being taken hostage means freedom for her. Her whole life she has always felt over-protected and trapped by circumstances and by a bloodline that determines who she is -the daughter of cold-hearted and dangerous man who is despised by many. While Ruark battle with his morals and other battles, Rose teaches him to find beauty and gratitude in each day. She is not threatened by Ruark, but intrigued. He is different from the life she has known, yet she is also grateful for the freedom he has unknowingly given to her. Rose's understanding is Ruark's undoing and he finds himself doing things he never expected and finding ways to keep her, yet also rescue his younger brother. Even if that means giving up things he thought he loved; sacrificing things that once he never would have consider.For Rose, things are different. Having known a life of security, being thrust into Ruark's world she is unsure of Ruark's feelings for her. He does not tell her everything and her insecurity creates a distance between her and Ruark. Yet, despite the sensuality that exist between Rose and Ruark there lack connection or chemistry. Much of the story is focused on Rose feeling trapped and unsure of her identity, a fact that is focused on again and again. While there is action and danger, the setting is also restricted to a limited place, mainly Ruark's home and surrounding areas. Rather than an adventure that will bond them together, Rose spends her time questioning herself and her role in Ruark's life, while Ruark sets about plotting his revenge. Rose and Ruark's love has great potential seen in how each cares for the other and yet something was missing. Overall I liked the story and found Rose and Ruark matched each other well."}, {"userName": "Chumchum_88", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19387048-chumchum-88", "userReview": "Weeeell...I honestly don't know what to say so I guess this review would be short. Plus this book was kinda vastly different from the books I have read lately.First lets talk about the hero and the heroine, I kinda sympathized with Raurk and Rose, for one he had a nasty father, abandoned by his love, banished to the sea for 13 years, and when he came back not everyone welcomed him with open arms. And for her she was like a confined creature, deprived from her freedom, always with the secrecy and the hush-hush, she has an asshole for father as well (something they both shared), and still they kept passing her around like some package, at least they both had gained their love and freedom together.What I noticed about the book while I read first strangely was it was full of J names like: Jamie, Jason, Jack,Julia. I liked Duncan, I thought he was the one betraying them with a twisted sense of honor, I'm glad I was proved wrong, cause he fit the gentle-hearted-looking-like-a-bully-bear-type. Plus I was glad the Jamie wasn't Raurk's son. I loved how Frair Tucker was like a father to Rose, especially the letter part where he signed Father.Overall, I want that in love with the book, and some things still didn't make sense to me, like the ring and what WAS the wish at the end? But to be honest the book still kept pulling me making me wanting to know what will happen next so its not that bad, but its not my taste. So it will end at being 3.5-4"}, {"userName": "Kristi Hudecek-Ashwill", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5581323-kristi-hudecek-ashwill", "userReview": "I loved his book! The characters were vibrant and the story drew me in to a point where I finished the book in just a little over two days.Ruark was a rock star! He was tall, dark and handsome and a little bit roguish and smart while Rose was a little like that herself. In a lot of romances like this, the women tend to do really dumb things and get the man mad at her or make him feel like he has to protect her. Rose really didn't do anything dumb but Ruark still protected her for good reason.I do wish he wouldn't have carried her around so much. I know he was a big guy but carrying her from point A to point B got sort of monotonous. It didn't happen on every page or anything like that but I thought it was a bit too frequent. Maybe I'm just jealous because my husband doesn't carry me, I don't know.The book was fast-paced and fun and it was easy to fall for Ruark. When I can make a connection with the characters, I'm hooked to the book and I made a connection with him and sometimes wished I were her. But it's just fiction. Right?As a side note, I think it's worth mentioning that this book is part of a series. I didn't know that until I entered it onto my \"currently reading\" status and clicked on it just to see what it was about. It didn't matter. I didn't feel like I jumped into a story right in the middle. It did very well as a stand-alone and frankly, I didn't see an opening for the story to continue."}, {"userName": "Char", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1109098-char", "userReview": "Two things kept this from being a 5 star book. First, I love the banter between the H/h that Melody puts in her books and because she is so good at writing that it just felt like there wasn't enough dialogue this book. And second, her heroine was just a tad too \"b*tchy\" for me (but who knows, if someone kidnapped me from my home maybe I'd be the same way, too--lol). Still, it was a great story--action packed and I never felt it drag. MT remains in my top 3 authors.

Readers need to know in what time period and in what location the book takes place, or else what is the point in writing a *historical* and not a *fantasy*. Unfortunately, Melody Thomas fails completely in setting this book up. She mixes Scottish history from every time period, referencing the Jacobite rebellion and the battle of Culloden, but also including definite medieval details.

The plot felt a bit wishy-washy to me, you kinda get it in the end but with neither the H or Hr being particularly strong it just fell a bit flat.
