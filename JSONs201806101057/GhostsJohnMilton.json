As I noted in my review of Beatrix Rose (#1 in that series) one almost has to read the two series concurrently in order to keep the relationships of the characters straight. They are as much about the interactions of the assorted assassins employed by a secret British government agency, in this case one that has been taken over by \u201cControl\u201d and used for his own purposes. That results in the disaffection of several of the best agents including Beatrix, Milton, and Pope. (I\u2019ll try not to reveal too much of the plot in order to not drop any spoilers into the mix.)In this one Milton is rescued from a Texas jail just ahead of control by a beautiful Russian agent (frankly I found it refreshing they never jumped into the sack; Reacher would have overwhelmed her with his charms within 24 hours - but done it politely even though he might not have showered in a week). A Russian agent whom Control tried to have taken out years before uses his capture of Michael Pope to force Milton into delivering some information that will destroy Control. Milton turns tables and mounts a rescue operation knowing that Control will probably try to have him assassinated along the way.I like Milton as a character and I like the stories. Lots of good fun reading. On to #5 Sword of God which starts out much like a Reacher novel."}, {"userName": "Terence M", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6658001-terence-m", "userReview": "Audiobook - 7:32 hours - Narrator: David Thorpe 4.0 out of 5.0 starsJohn Milton, the former \"Number One\" assassin of a highly secret British organisation, is arrested after a bar brawl and is rescued by beautiful Russian agent (clich\u00e9 much?). He is then blackmailed into trying to save the life his closest friend from \"back in the the day\" who is in the hands of the Russian Secret Service. Milton recruits hard-to-find Beatrix Rose, a former \"Number One\" and off they go to Russia. It's a good story, well plotted and well written, with just enough credibility-stretching heroics to satisfy the thriller reader who understands the need for some suspension of belief in secret agent type narratives.This trim and taut novel is enhanced by the introduction of John Milton's former mentor, Beatrix Rose, who now features in a series of her own. Her daughter, Isabella Rose, doesn't make an appearance, but she, too, now has her own series! More power to Mark Dawson. I look forward to John Milton #5, \"The Sword of God\". An excellent narration by David Thorpe enhances the enjoyment of this novel, particularly as this reviewer has a reading difficulty. I hope he continues narrating the whole series."}, {"userName": "Book Addict Shaun", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7403283-book-addict-shaun", "userReview": "In case you haven\u2019t read any of my reviews for Mark Dawson\u2019s John Milton series, it is fast becoming one of my absolute favourite series and that has only been proven further with Ghosts. My only issue being that it was shorter than the other main novels and so finished sooner than I would have liked. That said, it was a brilliant and gripping story. Milton is on the run from his former boss, the British government and \u2018Control\u2019 is still after him. After a flashback opening we see Milton in a Texas jail and are soon on our way to Russia via Hong Kong, England and back again. Mark always does a fantastic job of bringing his settings to life however I found myself wanting more here, especially in Hong Kong. In this book we meet Beatrix Rose who I know has her own series and I cannot wait to start that. The story here is very strong and absolutely full of tension, drama and action. There\u2019s some truly heart-stopping moments here and I couldn\u2019t read quick enough to discover them all. As with most thriller characters there\u2019s the question of just how they manage to always overcome those hunting them down and I want that to be done in a believable way, here it was. Obviously knowing this is a long-running series means I knew that Milton wouldn\u2019t be dying any time soon but that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t going to come close multiple times. Milton has so much depth to him as a character and has been very well-created by Mark with a great backstory and this is a character I am more than happy to invest my time in. As with the other books in the series Ghosts has left me absolutely desperate to continue with the rest of them however I am trying my best to save some of them for my holiday in May. The ending of this book leaves many questions and avenues to explore and I can\u2019t foresee a time that I would ever tire of reading about Milton. If you are yet to discover this character for yourselves then please do so right away. Easily as good as the likes of Lee Child, Tom Wood and Brad Taylor."}, {"userName": "Sam Grimm", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24853348-sam-grimm", "userReview": "Ghosts is the 4th installment in the John Milton Series and perhaps the most telling so far. Mark Dawson really opens up about the past of Milton. From Texas to Russia, Milton is on the trail. We are also greeted by the lovely and dangerous Beatrix Rose (another series by Dawson to check out). If you are in search of long books with \u201cfiller material\u201d to meet a certain weight, look elsewhere. Milton is an exciting yet mysterious character that will undoubtedly provide for many more creative yet unique adventures around the globe. Dawson\u2019s writing style is easy to follow and his method of weaving a tale is excellent. This is not your typical cookie cutter thriller series. Great work Dawson!"}, {"userName": "Simon Howard", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9638088-simon-howard", "userReview": "Book number #4 and the best so far, with action in London, America, Hong Kong and Russia this was truly an international thriller with a kind of James Bond feeling about it. Milton brings Jason Bourne's intensity mixed with Jack Reacher's sense of self reliance to the table, but adds in vulnerability and a burning desire to atone for past deeds.fast paced, with great action sequences MD still manages to pack in enough detail to keep the book feeling real (especially liked the Halo jump scene ) We see Milton properly tested this time as he goes up against people as equally trained as himself, including a great fight scene with a large member of Spetsnaz, complete with a Russian femme fatale Milton has his hands full, but could the true danger and maybe salvation come from closer to home?"}, {"userName": "The Cats Mother", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5720552-the-cats-mother", "userReview": "Definitely the best in this series so far, this begins by introducing the heroine of his other series, Beatrix Rose, whose books I will be reading soon. She was Milton's mentor, number One in the group of covert assassins for the British government when he started working for them, but things go wrong on his first mission, and she is forced to disappear when Control turns against her.Eight years later, a sexy Russian agent (cliche much?) rescues Milton from a Texan jail and persuades him to come to Russia to save his old friend who has been captured. He travels from Russia to Hong Kong to find Beatrix, then sets off on a mission alongside his nemesis Callan and other group agents.This is fast-paced and exciting, with good characters and just enough backstory to explain their motivations without overly rehashing the previous books. It's nice to know there are at least 6 more in Milton's series, plus BR's novellas, 3 books, and then a series about her daughter. The TBR list keeps growing..."}, {"userName": "Marleen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1616365-marleen", "userReview": "Having been a long-time fan of the BBC TV series Spooks, I got quickly engrossed in this 4th installment of the John Milton books. Finally, I felt that we got more background on how it all began for Milton, joining The Group, his first assignment in London and his connection to Beatrix Rose, the woman who recruited him.I am very eager to read more about Beatrix, but also what John will do with his regained freedom.

I started this book immediately on the heels of \n (the 2nd of 3 Beatrix Rose stories). Before I finished the Rose trilogy, I wanted to read about her first appearance. I enjoyed both books and to tell you the truth, I have liked all the Dawson books I have read. John Milton is a pretty cool guy who is experienced in the cold world of government assassins. While this book serves to introduce us readers to Rose and her quest for vengeance, it also seems to be an ending of one way of life for John and a new beginning of his travels. If you follow my reviews at all, you know that I am an action junkie fan (okay, zombies also) and I can say that IMHO Mark Dawson can write exciting suspenseful thrillers right up there with Morrell, Jon Land, and Brad Thor. I'll knock off a couple of other books in my TBR list and then move on to: \n, to see how that story ends and then catch \n (in which the story starts off with an homage to First Blood."}, {"userName": "Neil", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10278283-neil", "userReview": "This was book \u21164 in the John Milton series, and to my mind it has been the best one,............ so far. Each book seems to have improved on the previous one, and with this one the reader gets to find out more about Milton's past. Including when he first started working for The Group, as their \u211612, the reader is also introduced to his mentor, Beatrix Rose (then \u21161). This tale spans the globe, from a bar fight in Texas, through Russia and Hong Kong, and then a brush with England.Everything seems to gel with this book, from the way that the characters interact, to the taut plotline. So maybe the reader does have to suspend plausibility for a while, but this was an entertaining read. The twists and turns which the plot took only served to increase my enjoyment.The only downside to this is that I now have to try and dig out the Beatrix Rose series of books, but I am sure that I will cope."}, {"userName": "Jim A", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5496710-jim-a", "userReview": "This novel starts out in London, as a prequel to when John Milton was on his first assignment for Control. Very fast paced read with very little unnecessary prose. Dawson integrates the back story, for the new to the series readers, in way that does not really bore those who have followed Milton from the beginning.From my standpoint, this was a return to what made me get involved in this series. I really wasn\u2019t all that enthused with The Driver, immediately preceding Ghosts in the series. The way Dawson works the end game to this novel, he leaves the door open for the continuation. It\u2019s not a cliff hanger ending, just a way to continue if he so decides."}, {"userName": "Dan Dobler", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31297613-dan-dobler", "userReview": "Absolutely Great!I continue to be amazed at Dawson. This series is one of the best that I have ever had the pleasure to read. The plots, characters, twists, geography, culture, action, etc., are some of the best I have ever encountered.

I confess that I love series and mostly because I enjoy bonding and remembering the characters. Sometimes when you are a reader you get confused or plain forget. The characters merge into someone you\u2019ve read in the past. I have asked my sisters and our beloved mother had said same. John Milton is unforgettable. He is not perfect. He is not the average lead, glamorous, do-gooder. John is helping those who have no hope. Those that are not perfect. John makes you think. I am glad John Smith is back to John Milton. He reminds me a lot of Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs makes you realize so much that we take for granted. Mr. Jobs was real of course John is not but John is trying to do right now.

There were a few times when having a British author writing American dialogue just doesn't work. Geography is another minor issue. Examples: very rarely, if ever, have I heard an American say that they would get something sorted other than maybe their socks in their sock drawer. If there's a problem, we fix it, handle it, take care of it, or resolve it. Almost never do we sort it - unless we watch too many imported shows on BBC-America or Netflix. Also, The Hamptons, on the eastern tip of Long Island, New York were referred to as upstate. Nope. That's not upstate. Upstate is farther north in the main portion of the state, not Long Island which is due east of New York City about as far south as you can get before hitting either ocean or New Jersey.Otherwise no complaints."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50417664-peter", "userReview": "Sympathy for the Devil?Why do I feel sympathy for a retired super assassin with over one hundred victims?
