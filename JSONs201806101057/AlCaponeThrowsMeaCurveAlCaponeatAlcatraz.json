I thought the 3rd one was the last! It's exciting to be wrong sometimes...:)5/17/2018: Once again we have another great story about Moose Flanagan and his life on Alcatraz. It has been some time since I read the last one, Al Capone Does My Homework, so some details were hazy at first but when consequences from previous actions started appearing in the plot, my memory was joggled and I remembered the main points. Similar to its predecessors, this one is about sticking with family, growing up, learning to make wise and difficult choices, and coping with change. I am going to stop predicting what the last book will be (see my very first sentence); regardless of how many books there will be, I have enjoyed each one and recommend the series to historical fiction readers approx. 5th grade+."}, {"userName": "Sophia", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5063928-sophia", "userReview": "It was the title. I saw that title and just had to check this one out. The rest of the blurb had me even more eager to snatch up this middle grade historical fiction. A teen growing up in the mid-thirties... wait for it... on Alcatraz. Yeah, had to give this one a go.Al Capone Throws Me a Curve is book four in the Al Capone at Alcatraz series. I had no trouble jumping in with this book though I wish I had discovered the series at the get go so I could get them in order. Definitely going back to the beginning for the other three.Moose Flanagan is near the end of his school year and looking forward to starting high school the next year and hoping he can get on the baseball team. He lives with his parents and sister on Alcatraz where his dad is the assistant warden. Moose just wants to be like the other guys, but living on a prison island taking a ferry to school, having an autistic older sister who's just turned seventeen and having a mom who is not quite up to a daughter like Natalie means normal is a little different in the Flanagan household.I really enjoyed this story told from young thirteen or fourteen year old Moose's perspective. He's all boy, but has been forced to grow up fast and be responsible with an older autistic sibling and a delicate mother. He just wants to spend his summer playing baseball and being with his friends when first the Warden saddles him with keeping an eye on the Warden's precocious daughter whose around his age and he ends up keeping an eye on Natalie when his parents get preoccupied with a prisoner strike. A strong element in this book is Natalie and how Moose interacts with her as a sibling. Moose is protective of his sister and struggles with embarrassment and frustration because she might have a disability, but she is also very much a young woman and not a child. He has to keep her out of trouble and its tough on him when he's around his friends and has to bring Natalie along. I also loved how he took responsibility for things she did even if it meant feeling the crushing disapproval of the adults around him. He's very conscious of how to help her with navigating her needs whether it is sticking to her routine, helping her with calm down methods, not putting her in situations where she'll melt down, and also respecting that she is older and not stupid so her choices and happiness are important to him. He's a good guy and works hard to help people and he strives to be a good man like his dad. I totally would have had a crush on Moose if I was a teen girl.The historical backdrop of Alcatraz in its hey day was not skimped on. I thought the life of the families living there below the actual prison and of the inmates who had some contact with the families through those who worked service jobs was vividly sketched out and felt authentic. Moose has a dangerous situation that was not probable in some ways, but it took things to the heart of the prison and how dangerous it was inside. I thought the baseball, people with special needs, and family life in that era was also nice touches. Oh, and let's not forget the presence of the celebrity prisoner himself. It was neat to see some interaction with Al Capone. Moose is wary and has a healthy fear of the prisoners, but can't help being curious about some famous ones.I experienced this book on audio and really enjoyed Kirby Heyborne's rendition of Moose and the others. He handled Natalie's awkward vocal parts in a respectful way just as he masterfully handled a cast that included kids to adults of both genders and had a nice way of capturing the era in his voice somehow (maybe I was imagining that). I had no trouble feeling I was right there and that a young teenager was telling the story without an annoying voice. I liked the way he handled the really tense moments so that I felt my heart race with anticipation or suspense. Definitely want to listen to more of his work.All in all, this was a hit out of the park and I want more of Moose's adventures and life on Alcatraz. This is a book for young teens, but I think adults who like historical fiction would enjoy this one, too.My thanks to Penguin Random House Audio for the opportunity to listen to this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "V", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8649601-v", "userReview": "Before beginning high school, Moose struggles to join the baseball team and care for a sister with autism, all while living on Alcatraz Island.Moose is the son of the assistant warden on Alcatraz. He encounters many obstacles in his quest join a baseball team during the summer before his freshman year. Moose must look after Piper, the warden's troublesome daughter. He must convince an unreasonable baseball captain who wants Alcatraz souvenirs to let him play. And above all, Moose must care for Natalie, his sister with autism who turns 17.Heart-pounding action and authentic characters grab the reader and don't let go until the end. The real strength of  Al Capone Throws Me a Curve  is Moose and Natalie's relationship. Moose loves his sister dearly, becomes exasperated at times with her behavior, and balances their individual goals. Natalie, meanwhile, asserts herself as a young lady and develops many new social skills. Readers with siblings who have differences, be they social, mental, or physical, can identify with Moose's feelings, thoughts, and reactions to his sister.

Moose is still on Alcatraz Island, finishing up 8th grade and getting ready for high school and their baseball team. But the convicts are striking, his dad is up for Warden, he's been tasked with taking care of both Piper and Natalie, and there is someone on the island who is willing to use Natalie to hurt their father, even if Nat gets hurt, too. Completely as enjoyable and interesting as the first three. I enjoyed seeing Moose and Nat and friends slightly older--Nat is turning 17 now, despite their mother dressing her as if she's still 10. I worried a bit when the flap copy referred to her as \"fragile,\" but she remains the strong character she's always been. The stakes feel higher in this one, with them being older. And even though Natalie is manipulated by another (adult) character, she isn't blamed for this because it could have happened to any of them. What I love best about these books is how Natalie is clearly autistic, and has behaviors and actions that are associated with autism. But those behaviors and actions are never dismissed as being weird or bad. They have purpose. At one point, following her breadcrumbs for the birds routine revitalizes her and she's able to work with Moose because she was given the space to self-care. Her anxieties and meltdowns are given purpose and understanding. SHE is given purpose and understanding, and the same respect afforded to every other character in the book. She's a fully fleshed out character. I compare her and her rules to Cynthia Lord's Rules, and dislike Rules even more. I wish there were more characters like Natalie, and more sibling relationships like hers and Moose's. There really aren't any other out there that reflect the relationship I have with my brother, or what I see my friends having with their sibs."}, {"userName": "Seth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63304698-seth", "userReview": "This was by far the most tense and action packed book in the series. After reading, I feel doubtful that another book will come out, but with all my heart I hope for another one. This is a series that combines both funny and serious elements all in one to create a seemingly flawless mix of the two. I enjoy baseball, but that is not the reason this book was my favorite, it seemed to contain more elements and conflict which made it less predictable than most books which was a twist out of the normality you usually expect in books. Anyone with a brother or sister with autism will completely understand what Moose is feeling, and even those without will feel as Moose does."}, {"userName": "Ms. Yingling", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2636606-ms-yingling", "userReview": "Public Library E BookThere are a lot of things going on for Moose now that summer is approaching. He desperately wants to be on the high school baseball team, even though freshman rarely are. Also, Natalie has her 17th birthday, and her growing pains are evident. Her mother still dresses her like a ten year old, and wants to get her hair cut in a much younger style, but Bea Trixle has other ideas and not only cuts her hair in a stylish fashion for a young lady, but gives her two dresses that make Natalie feel more grown up. This causes some problems, including her crush on one of Moose's teammates after he is very nice to her and even gives her a button. Natalie keeps talking about Passerini, and even tells people that they are getting married. Bea even believes her! Moose knows he needs to have something special to bring to the team so that they let him on, and the other boys ask for pictures of Moose with Al Capone, and that sort of thing, which is just not realistic. Natalie hears this talk and brings their father's gun to a practice. This gets Moose in big trouble, but he doesn't tell on his sister. Piper is also causing him a lot of problems, since the warden approaches Moose to help look after her and keep her out of trouble. When the prisoners go on strike, Moose helps out with some of the work. One of the inmates, Fastball, is set to be released soon, so doesn't go on strike. When Bea plays a trick on Natalie so that Moose's father will look bad and her husband will be promoted to warden instead of him, Fastball is very helpful in getting Natalie out of a tricky situation. Moose realizes that while Alcatraz is a good place for him to be, it is not a great place for Natalie, and he helps his parents work through the process of getting her placed where she can flourish. Strengths: This wraps up the story of Moose's family very nicely, showcases some nice growth from all concerned (even the father and mother!), and offers a glimpse of a particular place and time that is at once unusual and yet universal. The struggles the family has with finding a good place for Natalie would have been more difficult in the 1930s, but are still not easy today, but it was good to see that she had an affinity for bookkeeping and was able to excel at it. Moose's every day struggles with friends, school and baseball are realistic as well.Weaknesses: I somehow didn't connect with Piper in this book, although I liked her in the past. Maybe too many other things required Moose's attention, so she got less. What I really think: Our 6th grade often reads the first book in this series as a class novel, so this will see steady circulation. I just wish we were close enough for the students to go on a field trip to Alcatraz! The notes at the end of the book are fun and helpful."}, {"userName": "Leonard Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17757241-leonard-kim", "userReview": "I don\u2019t know whether it is correct to compare this series to the Joey Pigza series.

I think the differing treatment of different characters\u2019 arcs across the books are comparable: some characters hardly changing and thus having difficulty adjusting to the ones who do, some changing subtly while retaining their essential character, and then there\u2019s Natalie whose arc is the emotional center of the series, even though it\u2019s not her POV\u2014she is an indelible character, moreso than Joey Pigza in my personal opinion."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/386358-susan", "userReview": "I love good historical middle grade series and Choldenko's Al Capone series is excellent.

I enjoyed all the books, but I think this one tugged at my heartstrings the most. Moose desperately wants to get on the high school baseball team as a freshman and has the chance if he will produce something that has a connection to Al Capone and Alcatraz. In the meantime, Moose is given the responsibility of watching over the warden's trouble making daughter, Piper, and Moose's older sister, Natalie, needs even more attention. She's seventeen now and even though she's autistic, she's learning to be more independent, and is attracted to one of the baseball players, which makes it hard for Moose to take her to his ball practices. When her life is endangered Moose makes a powerful stand, even if it doesn't benefit him.Growing up in a prison town, we saw prison trustees in the community, but like Moose, I wouldn't have known what to do on their turf.

No homework. No getting up early to catch the ferry. No teachers who think you flunked a few grades because you happen to be kind of big for thirteen and a half.Summer is freedom. Not for the prisoners, of course. But for us kids who live on Alcatraz Island. I loved this book and you will too.I know I'm always picking a new favorite opening, Esteemed Reader, but the opening of Al Capone Throws Me a Curve is definitely near the top of Middle Grade Ninja's List of Fantastic Openings Made of Win Because They're Everything You Want in a Book's Opening, or MGNLFOMWBTEYWBO for short.Let's break it down. First, Choldenko hooks us with the setting. To be fair, Al Capone Throws Me a Curve is the fourth book in a beloved series, so presumably many readers will already be familiar with the setting. Choldenko is reminding them of the dangers of Alcatraz and enticing first time readers, of which there will always be some who obstinately skip the first three books (***waves***). Second, she expertly sets the story's tone by simultaneously re-establishing our main character since this is a first-person narrative. She tells us what summer means for Moose, and shows he's a bit cheeky with that swipe at the prisoners who won't be having a summer of freedom.Two other things that win my heart right away are, one, every chapter is dated so there's never any question about when we are; it's Tuesday, May 26, 1936. If I had my way, every historical work would do this. Two, she finds a way right up front in the second paragraph to tell us our protagonist is thirteen and a half. Game, set, and match. All the essential exposition we need to know up front is seamlessly conveyed with a juicy hook set both in tone and in setting. If you're a returning reader, welcome back. Make yourself comfortable, newcomers, you're in the hands of a storyteller who knows what's she's doing. Obviously, there's more exposition needed. But exposition for exposition's sake is boring, especially since lots of readers already know this stuff. Observe how Choldenko slows down just enough to catch up the newbies and remind folks who've slept since the last book what the situation of our heroes is:\"Uh-oh! Uh-oh\" My older sister, Natalie, mutters like a character on a kids' radio program. Her blond-brown head is bent forward as she counts toothpicks in a row. She's tall, like my mom and me, but she holds herself in a way that makes her look younger and smaller than she is.My father's hand hovers over Natalie's toothpicks. \"Okay if I take one?\"Natalie hands him the last one in line.We moved up here from Santa Monica a year and a half ago so Nat could go to a school called the Esther P. Marinoff, which helps kids whose brains aren't wired like everyone else's. My parents sacrificed a lot for her to go to that school. We all did.My father was an electrician in Santa Monica, but he had a hard time finding a job up here. It's almost impossible to get work right now on account of the Depression. I don't understand exactly what the Depression is except it has to do with the banks collapsing and people not having money. Anyhow, the only job my father could get was as a guard and an electrician in the prison. Everybody likes him here, though, so he got promoted to assistant wardn.Since Nat's been at the Esther P. Marinoff, she's learned how to have a conversation--not just echo what you say. She still has a hard time looking people in the eye, but she has been trying really hard. Now we're helping her make friends.Choldenko's not just giving us a quick recap, but establishing one of the major conflicts of the novel. There's a bunch of stuff about baseball, one baseball in particular signed by Babe Ruth and another historical figure I won't spoil except to say that his name is in the title:) And all of that is just fine and young readers in particular will enjoy those aspects of the story. But at its heart, this is a story about the family of an autistic child.Seems like there's been a recurring theme of autism in the books we've been discussing this year, doesn't it, Esteemed Reader? That's not an accident.But the word 'autism' is never once mentioned in this book until the author's note because this story takes place eight years before autism was first diagnosed. Part of the tragedy of this tale is that our characters don't understand what's happening with Natalie or why she never snaps out of it. There aren't any resources to assist them or even educate them as to what they can expect or how they can help.If this detail doesn't break your heart, Esteemed Reader, I suspect there's nothing in your chest to be broken:Things have always been screwy around Natalie's birthday. Every year Mom pretends Natalie is turning ten again, instead of fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, or, this year, seventeen. Mom wants Nat to be younger so she has more time to catch up with the other kids.Choldenko doesn't shy away from showing the frustration both for Natalie and her family:\"No little girl dress. No.\" She spins faster.My mother marches to Nat's closet and picks the pink dress off the hanger. She unbuttons it, walks back to the kitchen, and shoves it in Natalie's spinning face. \"Take that dress off, now. It makes you look--\"Natalie hugs herself.\"Natalie, now!\" my mother shouts. It's awful when my mother loses control. Then it seems like there are two Natalies.\"No now! No now!\" Natalie knocks a vase off the shelf. It falls with a thud. A glass bowl crashes, splintering into pieces. She bangs her head against the wall, bites at her wrists, kicks the books off the shelf, and then collapses in a heap in the middle of the broken shards.My mother is shaking hard. She stands next to Natalie, unable to move.Natalie isn't just the autistic girl. She's a character as fully flushed out as the non-autistic ones. She has things she wants and needs. She knows how old she is and she wants to grow up and she wouldn't mind being kissed.But this isn't her series. Our character is Moose, our narrator through three previous books. And being Natalie's brother isn't always easy:When I get back to my apartment, my mother and Natalie are already gone. Under the saltshaker I find a note.Moose, four more days to go! Love, MomI can't help smiling at this. I didn't realize she knew I was counting the last days of school. I like when my mom acts like my mom. Sometimes it seems like all she thinks about is Natalie.This book is dedicated \"to every kid who has a sibling with autism,\" a position that brings plenty of difficulty as Choldenko knows only too well. She reveals in the author's note that her own sister was autistic and so she brings to these books that, again, are also about Al Capone and Alcatraz, a lifetime's worth of research born of experience. And it shows.There is no element of the story we experience outside of Moose's perspective and it's his frustration we feel most keenly. Moose wants to play baseball with the high school team, even if he's got to sneak them items to prove he's an acquaintance of Al Capone (it's a whole thing that a 'review' less focused on the treatment of autism would probably spend more time on). Although, I did get a chuckle at how difficult a prospect it would be for Moose to get a selfie with Al Capone in 1936, even if Alcatraz prison weren't a factor.When Moose is forced to take Natalie with him as he auditions for the baseball team, she's legitimately inappropriate, particularly for the more chaste era she's living in. Because autism isn't a known thing, the other kids don't understand. Moose doesn't entirely understand and you can feel his pain and frustration:\"Who's she kissing?\" Beck asks.\"Got to be Passerini,\" Dewey snorts. \"All the girls love him.\"The guys laugh.My cheeks turn burning hot. I jump up and dash to the bleachers. \"Natalie, stop doing that!\" I growl.\"Passerini! Passerini!\" Beck calls.\"Go on, Pass... kiss her,\" Dewey hoots.\"He, Pass. She wants you, Pass!\" Dewey, Beck, and Scout are all laughing.\"Stop it, Natalie!\" I hiss.She stops smacking, but her lips are puckered like they;'re frozen there. Her arms cover her ears blocking me out.I grab her arm. I know she hates this, but I can't stop myself. \"Don't do that with your lips!\" My breath is hot in her face.Natalie wraps her arms more tightly around her head, covering her face with her elbows. She doubles over, rolls up into the footrest of the bleachers.\"They're making fun of you. Don't you see?\"But the more I talk, the tighter Natalie pulls inside herself.I glance back at the guys. They aren't laughing anymore. They're staring. Even Scout.\"Get out of here!\" I shout, rushing at them.There also a lot of touching moments in this story, which I'm not going to share because I don't want to spoil them. And there's a somewhat villainous woman who takes particular interest in Natalie for her own nefarious purposes. Bea gives Natalie some grown up dresses and a more mature haircut, helping her escape her mother's intentions of keeping her forever ten, which is good. Unfortunately, Bea also places Natalie in harm's way.Although Choldenko doesn't go out of her way to show us the full brutality of the time period, she doesn't shy away from it either (without every straying too far from Middle Grade country). Being dishonest about the realities of 1936 would be cheat. We're told of grown men so hungry they lick the street where children's ice cream has been spilled. And I shook my head in disbelief at how an incident involving children and a gun was resolved.There's plenty of sexism to go around, both avert and less so, and not softened just because the reader presumably has more progressive thoughts than the characters (always assuming the reader isn't named 'Pence'). Even our likable protagonist says some things that wouldn't fly today, such as \"It's prison, not a women's club.\" No doubt, readers will bristle at some of the realities of the time, but Choldenko isn't writing about a fantastical past or an alternate history. That baseball signed by the Babe and Capone was real and so were outdated social norms, unfortunately.And that's where we'll leave it. Al Capone Throws Me a Curve is a very entertaining read that made me wipe my eyes several times before it was done and laugh out loud as well. Before we'll call it a review, I want to share one more of Choldnko's pro tips for writers. Here's a memorable way to describe a character's appearance in a first-person narrative without looking in a mirror:As soon as my feet hit the wooden planks, the dock officer, a man they call the Nose, comes over. The Nose got his name because he smelled convicts' moonshine hidden in a fire extinguisher.He's the same size I am--almost six feet--with the same brownish-blondish hair and brown eyes. Everybody says I look like him.As always, I'll leave you with some of my favorite passages from Al Capone Throws Me a Curve:My stomach is mixed up, like it can't decide if I ate too much or I'm hungry.My head nods like a traitor.I don't see how Alcatraz is going to get us on the high school team. But if anyone can wangle a way on, it's Scout. He can charm a tree stump. He can befriend a highway divider. He can convince a pen to become a pencil for the day.I've just turned away when I hear her voice, thin as chicken broth.Worst inning I've ever seen.Back in the field, Dewey fumbles a pop fly. Passerini walks two players. Beck trips and falls on his face. He spits out a mouthful of dirt.They're way better than this. Sometimes slumps are like a bad case of chicken pox. The pain has to run its course. You can't just snap your fingers and have it go away.Piper laughs in my face. I've never known anyone to enjoy my pain as much as she does.I keep waving until the ferry is small enough to fit in my pocket. And then I let her go."}, {"userName": "Melissapalmer404", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7812505-melissapalmer404", "userReview": "Book #24 Read in 2018Al Capone Throws Me a Curve by Gennifer CholdenkoI was excited when offered a review copy of this fourth book in a great middle grade series; I did not even realize a new one was coming out.

He's not your typical hero, heck he's only a kid for crying out loud, and yet I gotta say, I can't help but see him that way. Despite how he could have been...self serving, greedy, uncaring, mean, and the list goes on...he was none of those things. True, he had his moments where he wished life was different, be it the locale in which they live, the acquaintances they keep, or even his very family, but those are simply human emotions...no one is perfect, nor is anyone's life perfect, and the fact that he figures that out while still taking on the weight of the world and never giving up the good fight is hero worthy in my eyes. But I digress...he is not the only one of note here to mention. We've got Natalie, his sister, who sees life differently and has her own challenges to face, including that of a mother who simply can't let go...yes, it's harder in her case for apparent reasons, but life still moves forward, people change, people grow, and while protection may be needed, that need changes shape. Then there's Piper, who I has a seriously had time trusting, you'll find out why, but is yet another case of people changing and growing, even if they still misstep along the way. Let us not forget Moose's parents (well meaning, but stretched thin), the warden (*grr*), the other kiddos in their group, and...the prisoners. Yes, that's right...I mean, they ARE on Alcatraz, so yeah, they are \"residents\" too...and some get a bit TOO close for comfort.Turning our eyes back to the story on the whole, there were many moments that make up this tale that'll stop you in your tracks. I about died when Natalie tried to help get Moose on the baseball team...and was seriously worried someone else would! The preoccupation she develops with Passerini was daunting but sweet, even if not exactly meant to be, and I loved how the author dealt with it showing that not all kids/teens are heartless or lack understanding/compassion. When Moose does interact with Al Capone (SHOCKING!), I admit...I was prepared for so much more and yet the pearls of wisdom gleaned fit perfectly. Of course there's also the jailhouse sequence, which I shan't ruin by exposing here, but suffice it to say that it's a harrowing experience from start to finish . Seriously, hair-raising, breath holding stuff here.... *gulp*All in all, I had a great time in Alcatraz, and I'm pretty sure not many can actually say that. (LOL!) While entertaining, it also reminds us to stand up for ourselves, those we love, and what we believe in, and that growing up happens whether we want it to or not. All we can do is hold on for the ride and take it one day at a time. **copy received for review"}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1222379-barbara", "userReview": "This wonderful piece of historical fiction has all of the right elements--baseball, Alcatraz, brotherly and romantic love, and plenty of humor and life lessons. Just as she did in the previous three books n this series, Al Capone Does My Shirts, Al Capone Shines My Shoes, and Al Capone Does My Homework, the author weaves in historical bits from the early part of summer in 1936 to take readers back in time when this island not far from San Francisco housed several criminals as well as guards and their families. That particular growing up experience had to be unique for the children what with all the rules and restrictions that were in place and the possible dangers. In this book, thirteen-year-old Moose Flanagan, the son of the assistant warden, is eager to spend the summer playing baseball with the high school players across the bay, but all of them aren't as welcoming as he might like and he is saddled with Piper, the warden's wayward daughter, and his older sister Natalie, 17, who is on the autism spectrum. Although Natalie is making progress in becoming more social and more socially acceptable, she still behaves in ways that mark her as different. Even while she is becoming more independent, she is also engaging in some risky behavior, and Moose simply can't keep up with her. There's a prison strike and a threat against Fastball, one of the prisoners and his kitten, Bug, and some intrigue over the warden's position. There is much to recommend this book, including the glimpses it provides of prison life, untrustworthy individuals, including guards, and how important it is to know whom you can trust as well as when the right time to stand up for yourself and others has arrived. While it helps to have read the previous books, someone new to the series won't have trouble following the plot and sorting out the characters. This one is sure to be just as popular as the previous books. While the Al Capone aspect isn't what mattered to me, it will surely be a drawing card for young readers who will enjoy this as an independent choice or as a read aloud."}, {"userName": "Theresa Milstein", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4019647-theresa-milstein", "userReview": "It was a nice surprise to see a new book in the series, which I thought was done after 3 books. My daughter is now too old to read them ... but I'm not! I enjoyed being back on the island. I thought it had a pretty satisfying ending, but the events that led to the climax seemed quite a bet farfetched. I thought things were handled with Nathalie well. The book could've been a little longer to more thoroughly dig into some of the plot threads--for instance, some relationships weren't as developed as they had been in the past. I wish the scenes with the father and mother near the end were longer, more impactful. But I did love the last scene. The book veered slightly into YA territory, but never went overboard--but I wondered if she had decided to make it YA, like those later Harry Potter books, I think Choldenko could've explored some of the issues more. And can I complain I missed Annie in this one!"}, {"userName": "Read  Ribbet", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2259568-read-ribbet", "userReview": "Gennifer Choldenko is back with the fourth installment of the Al Capone series. This addition continues the stories of the families and their children who live on Alcatraz while they work at the prison which holds Al Capone. Moose Flannagan returns as he juggles his own desire to play on the high school baseball team with his family and friends. He has to keep an eye not only on the troublesome warden's daughter but also his older sister on the autism spectrum. The narrative explores typical problems and other more unique issues. A must read if you have been following the series and great read for intermediate students -- even if they haven't read the others."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8729871-brenda", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this series! I was a little lost at first, since it had been a few years when I read the first three books, but the characters and details quickly returned. I hope the authors continues this series, but this book does seem like a fitting end. The plot moved along at a good pace and there was just enough action to keep me interested and wanting to know more."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/409302-sarah", "userReview": "[the events surrounding the kids handling the gun really made me uncomfortable.
