They have been fighting their attraction for each other since their parents wed. This story will take you on another journey, this one into the dangerous back country, where danger and their mutual love will bring them closer. The author does a wonderful job of keeping to the time period and their way of speaking. This story picks up pretty much where it left off in book 1. Don't let the ending of this book make you too angry, because book 3 is ready to finish David & Annie's story. Although these are stand alone books, I recommend reading them in order to get the full history."}, {"userName": "InD'tale Magazine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13341540-ind-tale-magazine", "userReview": "\u201cBreaking Promises\u201d calls to mind the old cinematic epics.

Love historical fiction and enjoyed the continuation of the Cayle's stories. There is a cliffhanger at the end. That's my only complaint about the book."}], "description": "A Haunted Young Woman Annie McKechnie is desperate to go to the backcountry to her twin sister, Katie McKechnie Sawyer.
