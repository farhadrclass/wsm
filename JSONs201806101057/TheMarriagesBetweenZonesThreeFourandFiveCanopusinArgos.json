My favorite scene occurs near the beginning. Al\u00b7Ith (I don't know how you're supposed to pronounce it either), the proud, independently-minded queen of Zone Three, has somehow been obliged to marry Ben Ata, the coarse, soldierly king of Zone Four. They know nothing about each other. He tries a couple of unsuccessful conversational openings, then, frustrated, pushes her over on her back, holds her down, and efficiently rapes her. This leaves him feeling even more frustrated. \"I love you,\" he says angrily.\"I need to get hold of a dictionary,\" she replies."}, {"userName": "Ashen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8124568-ashen", "userReview": "I re-read The Marriages Between Zones ... over Christmas, and was no less impressed than when I read the book in 1980. The more interesting and gritty character is Ben Ata, representing a static patriarchal zone functioning within a strict structure, initially dramatised as is the way of fables. Ben Ata is both repelling and fascinating to Al Ith, who represents a static matriarchal zone, where intuition, while highly valued, has created a trance of harmony. Destiny (the Providers) call them to engage in a marriage relationship in Ben Ata's zone. The physical togetherness of the couple is pledged by a drumbeat sounding in the atmosphere of the place specially designed as their home in zone four. When the drumbeat stops at intervals, they must part and reflect. The reader too, is allowed to reflect on the gradual changes of perception occurring in both zones.This is a sensitive exploration of the creative conflict between opposed energies, the receptive intuitive and the active rational, with their specific politics and language.This conflict wars in each individual human being, irrespective of gender. Though some readers may understand the fable as a gender conflict tale it is much more than that. I read it in a wider sense as showing the dependencies of these energies on each other, for humanity to remain dynamic and alive, these dependencies that are there in order to achieve manifestation as well as the expansion of consciousness."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/656203-michael", "userReview": "I believe The Marriage Between Zones Three, Four, and Five is one of the best books I have read in my entire life."}, {"userName": "Azza Raslan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1250089-azza-raslan", "userReview": "I loved the Canopus in Argos series.

The second volume, The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four, and Five is unimpressive upon reading and almost impossible to reflect upon with interest. The bellicose inhabitants of Zone Five are unsophisticated, 'masculine' and heavy. The arty inhabitants of Zone Four are loving in an all-inclusive creepy way, 'feminine' and smug.

Ok, so in a way it is: despite the genre\u2019s name, you can make up any sort of futuristic anything you would like without having to base it in science at all. But the flow always has to be from the invention \u2014 an new technology, a new society, whatever \u2014 to the story. That\u2019s why the genre is sometimes referred to as \u201cspeculative fiction\u201d: you speculate about something, and then write a story to help answer the resulting questions. However, in \u201cThe Marriages\u201d, Lessing works exactly backwards: she starts with a story and then uses the science-fictional elements to force it to work. She needs to have a pacifist society exiting side-by-side with a militaristic one without the latter conquering the former? Fine, make it so that the people from one society can\u2019t breathe the air of the other (except they can apparently adapt to it, which doesn\u2019t really make sense, and sometimes it seems like she just forgets entirely about this restriction). However, she needs the ruler of the pacifist society (Zone Three) to marry the ruler of the militaristic one (Zone Four), so she creates a set of vague entities with God-like powers called the Providers who can issue commands directly to the brains of the inhabitants of the Zones. And to ensure that the rulers are not inclined to rebel against the command that they marry, it turns out that some unidentified malaise is affecting the people and animals of both Zones, one which is mysteriously resolved by this marriage. None of these elements are motivated in the least: Lessing just uses them as conveniences to overcome problems with her story, which weakens it considerably. Other science-fictional story elements are just under-conceptualized: Al-Ith, the ruler of Zone Three, is said to be in some way connected to the whole Zone, or representative of the Zone, but it\u2019s not clear how this works or what it means, nor is it explained why Ben Ata, the ruler of Zone Four, has no similar connection. Also, nobody in the book really seems to age (except children) \u2014 indeed, you get the impression that Al-Ith was some sort of eternal ruler \u2014 which is never really explained or confronted. And the energy beings or whatever who inhabit Zone Two are basically tossed off and then left hanging, with no explanation of how it is that the mostly ordinary people who live in Zone Three could become such a being (as some of them apparently do). All in all, Lessing would\u2019ve done better to avoid science fiction, as she\u2019s not very good at it.One could imagine the book overcoming these handicaps, but the fact is that the central story just isn\u2019t that interesting. Basically Al-Ith uses her civilizing influence to convert the barbarian Ben Ata into an enlightened king, which is apparently the only way that Zone Four can hope to escape the poverty it has been reduced to by its almost total militarization. (Le Guin would have done a better job with the politics of this book as well as its science fiction.) Supposedly this marriage has benefits for Al-Ith (and Zone Three, because of the mysterious affliction mentioned above) as well: I won\u2019t spoil the story by revealing them except to say that they seem pretty questionable to me. To be fair, Al-Ith and Ben Ata are decent characters, though basically exactly as you would expect them to be, and their interactions are well done. Plus, Lessing gets in some good shots at the smug self-satisfaction of many of the inhabitants of Zone Three. Still, the story contains zero surprises, except that it\u2019s surprising how little it contains that\u2019s at all new, and the way that Lessing tries to shoehorn Zone Five in at the end is just kind of silly. \u201cThe Marriages\u201d strikes me as more of a late-career folly than anything else. Read Le Guin instead: \u201cThe Eye of the Heron\u201d, \u201cThe Dispossessed\u201d, \u201cThe Telling\u201d, and \u201cFour Ways to Forgiveness\u201d all do something similar to what Lessing is trying for here, only much better."}, {"userName": "Jos", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18102778-jos", "userReview": "The first volume Shikasta was an alternative history of Earth and a more general contemplation on 'good' and 'bad'. This second volume is more specific. The focus is on 'men' and 'women'. While in Shikasta, different civilizations incorporated the extremes, these extremes - if you can call genders extremes - are represented this time by different zones presumably of Shikasta although the name is never mentioned in this book.Marriages is not so much space fiction anymore. Canopus is only addressed a few times in the form of 'providers' giving directions. Instead, on the outside it's a fantasy love story. The queen of zone 3, Al-Ith, and the king of zone 4, Ben Ata, are ordered by the providers to marry. When they are together drums are beating. From time to time these stop, ordering them to split apart which at first they do happily while later on they suffer. Finally, they split and Ben Ata is ordered to marry a chieftain of a warrior tribe from zone 5.Each zone embodies traits commonly considered male or female. Zone 3 represents compassion, peacefulness, arts. Zone 4 is militaristic, strong, orderly, dutiful. To complete the picture, there's the barbarian zone 5. From the former volume we know that zone 6 is the netherworld, the place of souls waiting for another incarnation or lost souls. Zone 2 is introduced as a higher place, advanced characters like Al-Ith are yearning to get there.Bringing together the individuals from the different zones at first seems to cripple the special skills of each individual while it' actually raising them to a higher level of understanding. Before they weren't a whole, only together they form an entity.While I really liked Shikasta, I struggled through this volume. Too much preaching the message of love and diversity, too much political correctness, too much feminism. I also didn't like the fantasy background used here."}, {"userName": "Paul Kieniewicz", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8048692-paul-kieniewicz", "userReview": "How do you set a novel in the afterlife while avoiding hackneyed formulae derived from spiritism or theology? Jean Paul Sartre gave us a memorable example in his play, No Exit where hell is a hotel with endless rooms. In science fiction, Philip Jose Farmer\u2019s Riverworld Series presents an engineered afterlife. Many SF writers followed that model, presenting prosaic variations on our world. Closer to Scotland, is Neil Gunn\u2019s Green Isle of the Great, a dystopian Garden of Eden ruled by fascists, with an absent God who only occasionally pops in to see how things are going. Very few writers attempt to include anything like a mystical vision, and for good reason. It\u2019s difficult to do credibly without getting mushy. Mysticism and science fiction have never blended well.In the Marriages between Zones 3,4, and 5, the second novel in the Canopus in Argos series, Doris Lessing makes such an attempt. Already in Shikasta, she presents the Earth\u2019s spiritual bodies as a series of zones. The dense Zone 6 is the entrance and exit to our world, a place of ghosts and illusions akin to the Tibetan Bardo. Then come Zones 5,4, 3 etc. each a self-contained world with its own rules. Zone 5 is ruled by a warrior woman and is involved in endless wars with Zone 4. Zone 3 is a mountainous pastoral place, but its inhabitants know nothing of what lies outside its borders. They can\u2019t breathe the air in lower Zones. Zone 2 is only a fable. A children\u2019s counting song runs,\u201cGreat to SmallHigh to LowFour into ThreeCannot go.\u201dWhen Al-Ith, the queen of Zone 3 is told to go and wed the warlike king of Zone 4, the command is for her a death sentence. But, this is the afterlife, and the orders, issued by its mysterious powers, cannot be disobeyed. She leaves her idyllic home to find a bleak land with an ill-mannered King, just as dismayed at the prospect of the marriage. She longs to return, but her way home is blocked. Also, that in Zone 4 she's forbidden to look up at the blue mountains of Zone 3. Transgressors are forced to wear a heavy helmet to stop them from looking up. She soon finds allies in a secret circle of women who sneak out at night and practice looking at the Zone 3 mountains. When she suggests to her husband, Ben Ata that his endless wars never resolve anything, he\u2019s shocked by the novel suggestion. A world without war? Impossible. but he listens to her. He also removes the ban on looking-up. They fall in love, have a child. He learns to appreciate Al-Ith\u2019s more mystical ways, while she learns to love him.Just when things are going well, a new order is issued. Al-Ith must return to Zone 3, leaving behind even her young boy. Ben Ata must go to Zone 5 to wed its warrior queen. Upon returning to Zone 3, Al-Ith finds that she no longer belongs there. Through her marriage to Ben Ata she has grown in awareness, and can no longer live in the idyllic land whose residents are unbearably superficial. The only place where she finds comfort is the wilderness where she can glimpse Zone 2. It\u2019s an ethereal land of light beyond the borders where no one with a heavy body can enter. Those who do never return. That land soon becomes her destination. If Lessing gives us few details of Zone 2, it\u2019s because it can\u2019t be described using our language. Yet we receive enough hints to know what it is.The Marriages Between Zones 3,4 and 5 is ultimately a fable. Courageous in that it dares to state, without New Age language or traditional religious imagery, that there\u2019s more to our existence than our physical life on this Earth. In so far as her vision is in the form of an accessible story, it goes where no religious or theological text could take you. This is science fiction at its best."}, {"userName": "Samuel", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12479432-samuel", "userReview": "I really, really wanted to give Canopus on Argos another chance. After reading Shikasta, I was disappointed, but at the same time strangely interested. Overall the book didn't work that well, but there were certain aspects that resonated with me anyway. However, after this book, I think I can put this series to a rest for now.This book repeats a pattern I have already described with Shikasta, that is, wrapping some high level message which I agree with (This time it is \"Always aspire to greatness, even if you think you're already great.\") with some kind of story that is not actually that great. So let's put the high level message aside, and look at the story, shall we?I would like you to first read and think about this quote (it's not from this book):\"You should be proud of yourself for how much I changed you!\"This quote brilliantly exploits the clich\u00e9 seen in so many \"teen dramas with \"strong female characters\"\" (Yes, that is a double quote. Yes, it is amazing.) - the heroine drags the male interest from intellectual void into enlightenment with her exquisite arguments and wit. (I have no idea whether this was a clich\u00e9 back in 1980, but I'll assume at least a little.)This brings up a question: Why should she? Well, she loves him. Of course she loves him.The problem is, this isn't the typical \"love on the first sight romance\". When AlIth and Ben Ata first meet, they both despise each other. But for some miraculous reason, after he beats her and rapes her a few times, they fall in love so deep you would have to send a submarine down there to find out why. And since I don't have a submarine, I shall remain forever clueless.To simplify: Think Daenerys Targaryan and Khal Drogo. But instead of a gradual, painful transformation from an abusive relationship to mutual respect, they just have sex a lot and then sit in silence until it clicks.Ok, so it's one of those stories. So what? Well, what bugs me is that this is somehow perceived as feministic. Because AlIth is a strong independent woman that can take a beating but still love her man, right?! Ok, that got dark fast.Yes, these situations do exist and they deserve to be written about. But not like this.Also: What the f*** was that thing about mothers wanting to f*** their children?! Is that a thing?!Verdict: The genitals, Ben Ata supposed, were his own, he recognized them"}, {"userName": "Ryandake", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4057623-ryandake", "userReview": "boy, they just don't write 'em like that any more.well, but of course they do.still, we are talking about Doris Lessing here.i recently was reminded of this series. i'd read them when they first came out. of all of them i remember finding this one the most accessible, the story most appealing. i am re-reading them one by one and shall report... but now, this one. how is it she could set up such obvious stereotypes and still make them breathe? the brutish lout of a husband, the wife a victim with such delicate (well, comparatively) sensibilities. normally my eyes would not stop spinning in my skull. but Lessing makes them breathe. you can sit right down next to them and feel their inner struggles, their conflicts with what they have been taught by their societies in contrast to the evidence before them. none of us can, as adults, ever really learn anything but the hard way. and Lessing doesn't give anybody in the book an easy way out.it's not a perfect book. the limitations Lessing sets up in the disparate cultures she describes hamstring the book in the end--there's really only two ways for it to go, so no surprises there. the deus of the \"Providers\" and their ordering about are horribly convenient. but in this book, it's not really the cultures or the larger schemes or the events that happen in the world that matter--it's the events that happen in Al Ith, and Ben Ata, and between the two of them that do. and those are just quite perfectly drawn."}, {"userName": "Z", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/286151-z", "userReview": "The idea that human civilisation be divided in accordance with stages of \"spiritual\" evolution is fascinating, and I could really sense the longing of each \"Zone\" for the learning and beauty of the next higher one. In a way, this resembles the religious devotee's longing for heaven, or God, or Brahman, the scientist's longing for Answers. And most of us have experienced this desperate urge to reach out to that which is \"higher\" than us.I picked this book because I did enjoy Shikasta, no matter that it meandered in parts - I've got to say, The Marriages... meanders far further than Shikasta ever did. The plot in itself is extremely interesting, and I expect it to fuel much imagining and philosophising on my part. But it could've been much shorter without losing any of its beauty and truth. As it were, descriptions of several scenes (including Al-Ith and Ben Ata's lovemaking!) had me yawning.Nevertheless, one identifies with the characters, feels the pain and longing of Al-Ith and the confusion and self-doubt of Ben Ata.

An exploration in prose of the limits of absolute femininity and masculinity and the intersections between these idealized, romanticized and poetic realms. Lessing is a fantastic writer, but the absolute nature of her genders - here rather essentialist for sake of argument - was a bit frustrating. Lessing advocates a social meld between masculine and feminine tendencies for a perfect, harmonious society, but whether she wishes this to be on a societal or individual level is unclear.

This is a on-the-ground version of events from the previous book. Not so much as a retelling of the same story, because in fact it\u2019s a very different story altogether, but a retelling of a perspective. Gone is the colonial voice of George Sherban (Johor) and his ilk, and instead we get the collective story-tellers of Zone Three, a put-upon area of Canopus on Earth (Shikasta) as their culture is threatened by the violent political outreaches of Zone Five, whose warlike nature looms over the marriage between its leader Ben Ata, and our Zone Three protagonist Al Ith. The resulting novel is sort of the opposite of a comedy of manners, because this novel, like a lot of Doris Lessing is relatively humorless, but does involve the kind of marriage and blending of cultures that biological impulses of love, sex, and marriage allow for.This is a very interesting follow-up to Re:Shikasta if only because of how very different it is in content and form. This is a novel, a relatively straight-forward form of a novel, but telling of a completely alien culture. And because it\u2019s written by someone imminently competent like Doris Lessing it\u2019s absolutely wonderful. Whole careers are wasted on this kind of material that she sort of rattles off in a year after her first novel from the series. She has that kind of way of a lot of other literary figures dabbling in genre (Margaret Atwood, David Bowie) of using her sheer force of talent to complete own a genre like this.Some books this reminds me of sans judgment: Seed to Harvest collection by Octavia Butler, The Best of All Worlds by Karen Lord, the Hainish novels of Ursula Le Guin, and Culture books by Iain M Banks.

But not enough to go back and finish the book. Yes, you read that correctly. I DIDN\u2019T FINISH THE BOOK. I gave it an honest shot. I slogged through 190 pages (out of like 245 or something). I started speed reading, skimming pages, anything to speed up the process but I couldn\u2019t focus enough to sustain this. I just kept thinking about THE NEXT BOOK, and how literally any book on my shelf sounded like a better option. So I scrapped it, mid-read. And no, I didn\u2019t give it 2 stars and write a review just so I could pad the numbers on my Goodreads Reading Challenge. I figured I had read enough to give it an honest evaluation, and who knows? Maybe someone who\u2019s considering reading this book will stumble across this and heed my warning. Don\u2019t waste your time with this one.I feel bad saying that about a Dorris Lessing novel, because I\u2019ve loved everything else of hers that I\u2019ve read. Among others, I had previously read The Sirian Experiments (a later entry in this same series) and really enjoyed the retro-sci-fi vibe and its commentaries on human nature from the perspective of an outside species. This one read more like an archaic romance novel. Like really archaic.So in this world (which is likely a reflection of ours but also uniquely its own) there are a number of \u201czones\u201d which seem to function like opposing countries. Each zone has different landscapes, different customs, and different types of people residing there. You need to take a \u201cshield\u201d with you to enter safely into another zone, as your body won\u2019t be accustomed to the climate. And that\u2019s honestly all I learned about zones after 190 pages. The story focuses on the marriage between Al-Ith (Queen of Zone 3) and Ben Ata (King of Zone 4), which was apparently called for by some mystic elders or something (you\u2019ll know they want you to go somewhere when you hear the mysterious drums playing in the background). We quickly see that they are a terrible match for each other, as they both embody the different values and ideals of their respective zones. Zone 3 is very loving and in-touch with nature, whereas Zone 4 is poor and tough and almost everyone there is part of the army.At first, I enjoyed the mystery of world-building as bits and pieces of this realm were slowly revealed to me. But that\u2019s all they ever were- bits and pieces that don\u2019t seem to mean much. Part of the reason I gave up was because there was literally no advancement of plot, or character development; everything was just,\u201cAl-Ith was summoned by the drums to Zone Four, so she went. Ben Ata was there waiting for her. Somehow she knew this. Ben Ata didn\u2019t look pleased. Ben Ata was angry at himself for needing her.\u201d I just made this passage up but it\u2019s pretty close to the stuff you\u2019ll find in the novel. The perspective sometimes shifts from Al-Ith to Ben Ata mid-scene, which appears to be a way of exploring the dichotomous nature of man/woman relationships, but this idea never really develops either. Just when you think there\u2019s going to be a big revelation or a statement about gender roles, it dissipates and the odd-pacing of the book takes another odd turn. Later on, Ben Ata is summoned to marry the Queen of Zone 5, but that\u2019s right about the time I decided to put this book back on the shelf\u2026Perhaps one day I\u2019ll return to this book in a better position to enjoy it or make sense of it. I would like to read the entire Canopus in Argos series, and it will probably make more sense to read it in order. In the meantime, I hope things work out for Ben Ata and his new bride.

The storytelling is colorful and deeply emotional, as well as tightly analytical.The novel takes place in mysterious \"zones\" surrounding our world. Zone Three is inhabited by a traditionally matriarchal society that is socially equal, peaceful, aesthetic, restrained and ritualistic. The people there are intellectual, philosophical, humble, close to nature, sexually polymorphic and unrestrained; in our terms extremely promiscuous. There is no concept of a core family or marriage, nor personal property or jealousy.Zone Four is inhabited by a patriarchal and militaristic society with a layered class system based on a tightly maintained hierarchy. The people there are emotional, aggressive, suspicious and conservative. They follow a strictly maintained institution of monogamous marriage that places the women in a position of servitude.The book tells a story of how the leaders of these very different societies are ordered to marry each other, with the queen of Zone Three travelling to live in the neighboring Zone Four. The result is a surprisingly original and keenly philosophical examination on societal structures contained within the inner monologs of the two leaders as well as their exhilarating dialogs. It was relieving to notice that Lessing doesn't result to clich\u00e9s or cheap comedic tricks in describing the interaction between the Zones. And it's not as simple as it could have been made to be. Yes, the book is clearly a kind of feminist manifesto with the matriarchal society described as a utopia, but somehow the deeply troubled patriarchy is still respected to some degree. It's not labeled a \"bad\" culture, but a society facing challenges and growth. And the eventual introduction of Zone Five balances the themes a bit.The only thing that was in my opinion a bit off was the way the femininity of Zone Three, with its fascination with beauty and emotional restraint, was femininity of the kind expressed in patriarchal societies. Then again, who am I to say what kind of a culture could develop under what conditions. Our own existing planet has already shown the baffling diversity of that process. Furthermore, one of the two societies' functions in this novel is to serve as a direct allegory to our very own culture and the gender roles of the two sexes, allowing for a certain kind of obviousness. So, no real complaints, just observations.If you've read \"Shikasta\" and it made you think you weren't interested in this saga, I urge you to try out \"Marriages,\" as it's a more traditional type of story that's still filled with innovative solutions and wise observations. It revived my interest in the Canopus in Argos all over again."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24601777-chris", "userReview": "This one was hard for me. It was a book club selection for my Classic Sci-Fi book group. The champion of this book immediately had to defend it on the question, is this science fiction? It's really not, I'd say it's more of a fairy tale or morality play. That's ok, but my main complaint here was that this had the subtlety of a kick in the head. Lessing is a very strong feminist, and this is a very genre specific second wave feminist tome. I'm ok with that, and the message has it's place in society. I really have two criticisms. First, I just don't think this has aged well, as the society it is criticizing isn't all that recognizable to me. That may be more on me then the author, as the older members of our group strongly defended it in that context. The real criticism I have is the dryness of the characters. I just didn't like them. Al-Ith and Ben Ata are cardboard cutouts. They do grow as the book goes on, but they never actually become likeable. As one member of the group said, I just didn't care for her. The supporting characters aren't much better. It made reading this a grind, as I had problems reading more then 20 or so pages at a time. This was made worse by the lack of chapters. The odd things is that after struggling to get through it, you sit back and say that wasn't that bad. Lessing does get her ideas planted firmly in your head, and they stay with you afterwards. There is a place in the world for feminism of this kind. We're certainly no where near the equal society that it would be great to have. I probably should pick up some of her other stuff, but this book wasn't good enough for me to read the other books in the series. That said, I'm glad I did make it through this one."}, {"userName": "Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1340552-patrick", "userReview": "WHEN George Orwell complained just after World War II about the decay of the English language, he insisted that its decline was not inevitable. While pessimists argued that our language - like the civilization it reflects - was doomed, Orwell insisted that ''The process is reversible.'' If language is languishing, he urged its rescue; if thought is sloppy, well, it was time to think clearly.Now, writing out of the same country as Orwell, but out of a less pragmatic political tradition, the British novelist Doris Lessing repeats Orwell's lament about language. But it has become more urgent. ''Words, words, words, words,'' a character cries in her latest novel. In fact, language has become so grotesquely distended in her fictional realm that citizens suffer from a condition known as Undulant Rhetoric. Their eyes glaze, their breathing becomes heavy, and out of their mouths come symptoms of political intoxication:The ''ritual patriotic mode'': ''We shall fight them on the beaches, we shall fight them on the roads, we shall fight them in the air!''The postrevolutionary mode: ''The worms and maggots that have crept into our healthy new society will be squeezed out and exposed before the bar of history.''So serious are these disabilities that sufferers are placed in the Hospital for Rhetorical Diseases, where they go on the rhetorical wagon and are treated for their addictions."}, {"userName": "Flan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/852845-flan", "userReview": "Doris Lessing's books take some thought and dedication to fully understand. In my experience it is worth the effort. There was much to reflect upon in the first of this series and I grabbed this volume to see what happens next only to be treated to an amazing parable that I think about quite often. Zone Three, a matriarchy, has reached a level of peace that results in stagnation. Procreation doesn't happen any more. The spring doesn't bring fields of lambs. The fecundity of nature is lost. Peace has resulted in a lack of vitality. It is decided to marry Zone Three to Zone Five. Zone Five is a rustic Patriarchy, crude, loud and unfeeling. The Marriage scene is basically a rape. How many times has this been repeated in human history. A woman of great discernment and refinement chooses to be defiled to save her people. For me one of the most moving scenes is when the queen realizes the women of Zone Five who have no power, who work constantly and thanklessly, and do as they are told begin to change. They always look down. Women know this is something we are taught, and the present political atmosphere shows how women quickly become enemies when men of fear come into power. As the queen watches, she sees the workers in the field for the first time, look up. When they look up they see, in the distance Zone Three, and for the first time consider possibilities.This book is a wonderfully crafted fable that hold many human truths in its pages. To treat it at face value is a real disservice to the reader."}, {"userName": "Dr.J.G.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52346722-dr-j-g", "userReview": "One of the most amazing books by an amazing writer, about what looks like a marriage between a king of a little brutish society to someone from a more civilised one (and don't try to think you know what that means, you would lose any bets on that - unless you are one in a billion or rarer) and both suffer in the process, which (the process) is intended for the purpose of civilising the various zones. She brings beauty and gentleness to his strength but is dismayed often by his and his society's ways. And just when the marriage begins to look like it is a success by our normal standards is when it is time for more progress - for her, the way is upwards, to a zone that is above human, almost, with its incredibly beautiful description, high in the mountains and blue air; for him, it is another marriage, this time he is the civilising agent of a fierce tribe queen, a warrior. He misses his first wife and sighs and proceeds to do his duty in the evolution. Many, many unforgettable parts, beautiful moments, and especially her leaving for the zone two and arriving and finding them there to receive her. Perhaps there was a real life model for that part, in the woman who travelled alone through Himaalaya a century ago. I forget her name at the moment."}, {"userName": "Andy Todd", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64796422-andy-todd", "userReview": "Canopus in Argos Vol. II: enthralling visionary tale, compelling use of language, inspiring."}, {"userName": "Isabel (kittiwake)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7038421-isabel-kittiwake", "userReview": "There is a scene particularly loved by our artists who embellish it with a vast yellow moon positioned so that it is close to, or behind Al.Ith's head. Or there is a delightful crescent set off by a star or two. and they oft add a large peacock, whose shimmering tail fills the orchard with reflected light.But it is on the whole a realistic depiction, and I am saying this because it is the last of the truthful scenes.The second in the Canopus in Argos: Archives series is an allegory about love and change rather than a science-fiction story. Al.Ith, the queen of Zone 5 and Ben Ata, the king of the less advanced Zone 4, receive an order from the Providers telling them that they must marry. Although it is generations since the last communication from the Providers, whose role appears to be to oversee the zones and prevent stagnation, no-one in either zone seriously considers disobeying the order, even though neither monarch is happy about marrying someone from another zone.Interesting, but I think that I prefer \"Shikasta\"."}, {"userName": "Eija", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4719547-eija", "userReview": "Shikasta, ensimm\u00e4inen osa Canopus Argossa: Arkisto -sarjasta oli hyvin raskasta tavaraa.

In the end we get a brief hint that the health of the planet itself had improved thanks to the harsh intermingling between the different zones. Lessing beautifully potrays how painful a relationship could be when each person in the relationship comes with his own view of what romance means.
