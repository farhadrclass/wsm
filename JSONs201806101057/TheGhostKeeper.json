The characters are relatable and so human! Morrill treats difficult subjects of life and death, suffering and forgiveness, and other even tougher issues, with a compassion, intelligence, and insightfulness that is quite rare. And her writing style is detailed, nuanced, and delightful! The novel captivates from start to end and I would highly recommend it to anyone."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2378632-kate", "userReview": "That was fascinating. There are tense switches that would be ill advised under a different writer but it works very well here. Josef is a character possessing an integrity and forgiveness that seems boundless. This is a very tender, quiet, and engrossing read. Historical fiction fans take note!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18694811-elizabeth", "userReview": "4.5"}], "description": "Winner of the HarperCollins/UBC Prize for Best New Fiction, this powerful, sweeping novel set in Vienna during the 1930s and \u201940s centres on a poignant love story and a friendship that ends in betrayal.In the years between the two world wars, Josef Tobak builds a quiet life around his friendships, his beloved wife, Anna, and his devotion to the old Jewish cemeteries of Vienna.
