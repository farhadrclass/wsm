Some of the characters in it might prove forgettable in time, but I will never forget the pressing, claustrophobic feeling it left me with. I\u2019ve read a few reviews in advance and I was prepared to be unsettled by it, but nothing could prepare me for this story in which people, every last one of them, were monsters, usually hidden behind a very pleasant fa\u00e7ade. When, decades ago, two identical ships were launched into space on a mission to find New Earth and settle, everyone thought their chances of survival were pretty much the same. After all, the only difference between them was the religious conviction of their respective crews. Weaverly and Kieran belong to the first generation of children born on the Empyrean \u2013 the ship with a non-religious crew. They are both fifteen and thinking about getting married \u2013 in their circumstances, children are always welcome, no matter how young the parents. They have their lives planned out for them and they\u2019re happy with the way things are going. But the New Horizon crew hasn\u2019t had as much luck. They haven\u2019t been able to procreate at all, which means their crew is fairly old and they are pretty desperate. Their solution is to attack the Empyrean and steal all their girls, nearly destroying the ship in the process. Suddenly, Weaverly and Kieran aren\u2019t even on the same ship and each of them is dealing with a different set of disasters.The name Weaverly seems like an odd and unfortunate choice, especially for third person narration. Since Ryan seems to harbor a strong dislike for personal pronouns, it\u2019s used in almost every sentence, and, being a mouthful, it clogs the natural flow of sentences and makes the already thick narrative even harder to read. That is, writing-wise, the only objection I really have. Amy Kathleen Ryan showed unusual skill and control.Because so many awful, hateful things happen in it, Glow is a hard book to like. There is no real warmth between the characters, nothing even remotely positive or hopeful, just violence, horrible moral choices and more violence. One couldn\u2019t exactly call Kieran a hero, not by any stretch of the imagination, and the same goes for the rest of the characters. They behaved exactly as one would expect people in such an isolated environment to behave: they have deviated drastically from moral and ethical standards of society.Faced with a crew made up entirely of rebellious boys, Kieran decided to lead them through a religion he pretty much made up on the spot. The ease with which this decision was made and the way those boys accepted it was incredibly creepy and eye-opening. Their sudden faith in Kieran was alarming, and the speed with which this cult of personality arose staggering. There are many more things that unsettled me and kept me awake at night, but writing about them would give away too much of the plot. It\u2019s best to go into this book knowing very little about it. Fortunately, I have the sequel, Spark, on hand, but I\u2019m not brave enough to read t right away. My poor little heart needs a lengthy break."}, {"userName": "Christy LoveOfBooks", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1390723-christy-loveofbooks", "userReview": "Here's the thing, the books that I absolutely LOVE the most tend to be the hardest for me to write about or discuss. Glow is no exception to this, but I'll do my best. And I'm just going to admit it - this is now a favorite of mine.First of all, I hate comparing books to one another, especially those by different authors. But I am going to compare something about Glow to The Hunger Games. Suzanne Collins knows how to end a chapter, meaning they ended in a way that made me want -no, more like need- to read the next one, and the next one, and the next - I couldn't stop. This is exactly what Glow did for me. There wasn't one point in the entire book that allowed my mind to wonder or bored me. I hung on every word. Two ships, the New Horizon and the Empyrean, are headed to New Earth to inhabit a new world. Unfortunately, the affects of deep space has caused infertility issues among both ships. However, those on the Empyrean discovered a \"cure\" for the infertility and were able to conceive children to continue the population. But something goes horribly wrong aboard the New Horizon - the \"cure\" sent by the Empyrean sterilizes the women, taking away any hope of conceiving future generations for New Earth. Was this done on purpose or just a terrible accident? Either way, the ''captain\" of New Horizon decides to take drastic measures to ensure the ship's survival and fulfill their mission. Waverly is a 15-year-old girl who was one of the first born aboard the Empyrean, she feels that there is more to her life than simply expanding the population. When disaster strikes, it falls to her to become a leader and to make sure the girls are safe. Kieran is a 16-year-old boy who is expected to become the next captain, and happens to be in love with Waverly. But can he become the leader the ship needs when the time comes? Not only are these two main characters well written, but the supporting characters are well done, also. The author did a wonderful job at developing all of them. They were complex - making some hard to flat-out love or hate. There were characters who were awful, but after finding out more about them and the situations, it was easier to understand why they were behaving certain ways or held certain beliefs. And sometimes it's the people who you don't like who turn out to be the biggest allies. There was so much that I loved about Glow, and I really, really, really hope people don't try to compare this book to Across the Universe. That would be like comparing Star Wars and Star Trek - just don't do it. Though they're both really good books - they are their own thing. So saying that I highly recommend this book would be an understatement. I am already dying for the next installment of Glow, and this one hasn't even been officially released yet!"}, {"userName": "Reading Corner", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46088881-reading-corner", "userReview": "I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did but I really enjoyed reading this one.It's a fast-paced sci-fi with a dark plot and complex characters.The narrative switches between Kieran and Waverly who are the oldest teens aboard the Empyrean and have a flourishing relationship, despite Seth's intimate feelings for Waverly and hate for Kieran.However, things turn for the worst when the New Horizon attacks and kidnaps all the girls aboard the Empyrean, leaving the boys and adults in a desperate situation.The plot is so good and surprisingly,quite dark.Personally,I enjoyed the darker elements of the story as many YA books don't delve into dark themes whereas,Glow most definitely does.The plot even takes a grim route for both Waverly and Kieran,as they both face very different but serious challenges.The sci-fi aspect completely enthralled me and I loved the setting,as the story takes place on a ship which is heading for a distant planet in hopes of repopulating.The plot never bored me and I was continuously entertained and anxious to know what happens next.All the characters in this book are written brilliantly as they're all complex and not unrealistically one-sided.This makes it hard to even hate the villains or people who make questionable decisions as they display at least one good quality, like compassion.This caused me to frequently change my opinions on the characters because I always felt like there was more to uncover.Also, their actions weren't predictable which created an even more exciting plot.The love triangle between Kieran,Waverly and Seth wasn't very pronounced in this book, thankfully but I feel it will be in later books.Seth was mostly annoying and Waverly was ultimately my favourite.I loved her eagerness to survive and her developed braveness to escape.However,some of the action scenes did annoy me like a certain one with the girls, where their plan is just terrible and how easily they get caught.Also,I didn't like how the ending began to play out with a suggestion of a cult motive.As a whole, I loved the book and it was a well worthwhile read,I'll definitely try to pick up the next one.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is repulsed or frightened by dark themes."}, {"userName": "Sita", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5831199-sita", "userReview": "[Glow is about two teenagers Waverly and Kieran, the book is told from both their points of view\u2019s (third person direct) and the way it\u2019s set out is original and really smart.

Kieran proposes to Waverly but she says she\u2019ll think about it, heres your cue Seth (is awesome), let me just say that this is not your average love triangle. Well they soon find out that another ship (one that left one year in advance) is infertile. So they basically ask Waverly and Kieran\u2019s ship to mate with them. The ship says no. So they take all the girls (under 16) to their ship to take their eggs to have children so they don\u2019t die out.

Thank you all for this wonderful opportunity! Actually, this is closer to three-and-a-half stars, but I don't do half stars, so it's four.There are some books out there that are completely clear in their intentions, whose characters are completely either good or evil, whose plot is simple enough to be easily understood. Let me tell you know that GLOW is not one of those books. GLOW is not a book you sit down to read intending to finish it in one sitting and move on with your life. GLOW is one of those books you sit down to read intending to savor it and become engrossed in the not-so-clear intentions of the characters and the constant twists and turns of the plot.GLOW is written in third-person perspective, something which doesn't enhance anything about it and seems to kind of disconnect you from the narrator characters. The reader feels more emotionally attached to a character who speaks from the first-person perspective because you think, \"What if I was experiencing this?\" With third-person perspective, you think someone else is experiencing it and you don't pay attention to what is really going on. The perspective of the book is one of the two factors I feel chopped off a whole star from me.Imagine it like this:Scenario 1 (Third-Person Narrative)You're watching this on TV.How do you feel? Maybe you laugh, say \"Wow, that would probably hurt!\" and carry on.Scenario B (First-Person Perspective)Your friend tells you, \"Wow, I got in a really bad ski accident,\" which plays out like this in your head:How do you feel? You are starstruck, say \"Oh, wow, I'm so sorry! I bet that really hurt,\" and feel bad for them.Which would you rather read about? The emotionally-detached one or the intense, attached one?That's how I felt about GLOW, like it would've majorly benefited from a re-vamp perspective-wise.Now, I have the other reason GLOW is only four stars:The conclusion.Which it shouldn't be called, because the story felt in no way concluded at all. Ryan's lame attempt at a cliffhanger didn't help, either. If you've read this book, you know what I'm talking about. How it resolved felt in no way resolved, and like Ryan was just setting you up to buy the next 11 installments of the SKY CHASERS Series. The main, persistent problem set up within the first 60 pages of GLOW isn't even resolved. Something else is minorly wrapped up, but when I closed the back cover of the book, I felt in no way satisfied by the ending.GLOW is an extremely enticing read with twists and turns around every corner, but it lacks emotionally with main characters written poorly and an open-ended conclusion that doesn't fully deliver. The cast of supporting characters is suspicious enough that you don't know who you can trust -- and when you do, you're wrong. High-octane action and suspense make GLOW a hit!"}, {"userName": "Arlene", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1746727-arlene", "userReview": "[If you're wondering how Waverly was violated, she was drugged and when she was out, the doctors on the New Horizon removed some eggs from her to implant in the infertile women of the New Horizon.

Books that demand my attention when I\u2019m away from them, that creep into my thoughts after I\u2019ve closed the covers. I like Kafka\u2019s idea that books should be an \u201caxe for the frozen sea inside us.\u201dBut there was something wholly unpleasant about the queasy stomach I was left with at the end of Glow, and the way I wanted to brush my arms, as if I could sweep away the feeling of something crawling on my skin. Arguably, a strong emotional reaction is a good thing. Better to have feelings that tend heavily one direction than to feel underwhelmed and decidedly \u201cmeh\u201d about the whole thing, in my opinion. But in this case, it\u2019s proving difficult for me to step back and simply respect the skill it took to create such feelings (which I do), because it\u2019s hard shake my instinctive revulsion to the events of Glow.This is a dark story that deals with complex, often unpleasant subject matter. So brava, Ryan, for choosing to write a story that tackles heavy themes and does not shy away from taking unexpected turns, and doesn\u2019t replace plot with vapid love-triangle angsting. (This is certainly not Matched : In Space].) I won\u2019t write a synopsis, but take some general ideas from Lord of the Flies, manipulative zealots, and a pervasive atmosphere of sexual threat, put them in deep space, and you\u2019ll be in the ballpark of the premise.Initially, I did not enjoy the writing \u2013 I found it thick and impenetrable, preventing me from connecting with the action or the characters. While this eventually changed, and it captured my full attention, I had to push myself through the first half and fight my waning interest. However, this is likely down to my personal taste rather than a criticism of the mechanics of the writing.The latter half of the book is fairly dense with a sense of claustrophobia and mounting dread. The situations the characters are in are awful and kept me in a near constant state of unease. (Also, it\u2019s an interesting experience to read a book where I feel repulsed by almost all of the characters.) In fact, it\u2019s probably the unrelenting gloom, the persistent \u201cevil\u201d (to varying degrees) of a large number of the characters that made it difficult to read. When I eventually began to connect with the writing, I then felt trapped by anxiety at the direction the plot threads were taking.To be fair though, this driving of the story and characters further and further down a frightening path sets the stage well for the sequel. Rather than dropping in a last minute cliffhanger, Ryan has crafted a finale in which the characters\u2019 identities and motivations are so much at odds with each other, that it sparks genuine curiosity at how they will ever achieve some kind of peace amongst themselves, if at all. Essentially, the book leaves the unpleasant feeling that things are very, very wrong, and not a whisper of a clue as to how they can become \u201cright\u201d again. While the cover (of the UK/Aus edition) is reminiscent of Across the Universe, and there are some surface-level similarities, the tone and execution is vastly different. Glow is a disquieting book. The content is quite heavy and writing, at times, distancing. However, it does leave an impact and raise some interesting stakes for a continuation of the series."}, {"userName": "Bern", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4789508-bern", "userReview": "Full Disclosure: This book was given to me on a GR giveaway. So thanks GR!I honestly didn't expect this. I really didn't. On the back of the book, it's written in huge letters that this is the most riveting series since Hunger Games, and that's not true in the least.This book beats Hunger Games to a bloody, motionless pulp laying on the ground with its limbs positioned in odd, wrong angles. I mean it. I does.Glow (don't let the cutesy name fool you, there's craziness to go around in this book) starts with Kieran and Waverly, two teenagers aboard the spaceship called Empyrean, whose mission is to traverse space to New Earth from the old, dying Earth they left behind. Whilst crossing a nebula, however, they're attacked by the other ship that left Earth a year before them, the New Horizon. They kidnap all the young girls, including Waverly, and kill some people in the process. It falls to Kieran and to Waverly to fix the whole situation, kilometers away from each other in deep space.That synopsis up there makes no justice to this book. Really, the story is so engrossing and the characters so interesting there's never a moment of boredom. You think you know who the bad guys are, how it's going to end, what's going to happen, but turns out you're wrong. It's not that there were twists, properly speaking. I don't know, some people may think of the shifts in the plot as twists, but they were so subtle and fluid I just saw them as the new destination the narrative was taking.I think you can safely say that a book is well written when you hate the characters the writer meant for you to hate, feel for the ones the writer wants you to feel for and when the plot is so intense you're capable of being enthralled even when nothing action-y is happening. This is the case here, only there's a catch when it comes to knowing which character to suspect: you can't know for sure. Some characters go through life changing ordeals throughout the book that changes their outlook on life, and that also changes their attitude and the way you think of them.Also, I thought it was really interesting how Amy Ryan approached the subject of a self proclaimed messiah. Such character wasn't some religious bigot before, nor did he think he had insight into God's mind, but after spending a month starving, the voice he heard in his head, the one that at first was his parents telling him it'd be ok, then was his girlfriend's telling him she'd join him again turned into a faceless voice. A voice that told him he'd be ok, that promised him freedom and everything he wanted. Surely, then, it must've been the voice of God. Except wasn't it just a voice in his head caused by prolonged starvation? I think this was a genius approach to the matter, and although I won't comment further so as to not cause any religious debate, let's just say I agree fully with this book.Anyway, no matter what you take away from this review, bottom line is: pick this book up now and read it. Seriously. You're going to love it. The voice in my head told me so.What? Nothing. Did you say something?I didn't..."}, {"userName": "Nic", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2813423-nic", "userReview": "Rating: 3.5 stars but just barelyIn one sentence: Glow is an out of this world love story that takes you on a fast paced thrill ride. I know some of you are reading the synopsis thinking spaceships, sci-fi, that is so not your thing but Glow isn't just for sci-fi fans. It definitely will appeal to fans of paranormal or dystopia reads with it's great blend of romance, adventure and suspense (I would call it light sci-fi). I know that with other sci-fi reads I have struggled with the world building but this is an effortless read that you become quickly absorbed in. I loved that the action happened less than 50 pages in and from there on in it was a completely pulse pounding read. Every page seemed to be full of excitement and suspense. Although some events in the story seemed a little too convenient and hard to believe. But despite that I think the plot and the world Ryan has created is the strength of this book. Glow is told in two points of view, Waverly and Keiran. I am a big fan of dual narration especially when it works well and flows seamlessly into each other and it definitely did in Glow. Without it I think I would have been lost as Waverly and Keiran were apart for majority of the story and it really helped give you the complete picture of what was going on.Waverly is a compelling character. Mature, strong, a fighter and most importantly likeable. I love that she doesn't give up easily and isn't afraid to ask the hard questions. However with Keiran I struggled to get a real sense of who his is. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed his point of view, it provided plenty of heart-stopping moments, but at times I felt his character was a little inconsistent. I also felt this way about Seth another important character. Sometimes they were nice honorable guys but the next minute they were being cruel and heartless. This may have been just because of their world was falling apart around them but I felt a little confused. I look forward to figuring them out in the next book.Overall, Glow was a gripping and intense start to this series.

There are people isolated, people drugged and violated... all acts done because of someone's vision of what others' roles should be. I was shocked by what they could do/ did.

The book is fairly short so it wouldn't have made it too long.But, this book is nearly perfect otherwise. An original, twisty plot (yes, there are similarities with other books, but Ryan has done something really unique with old tropes), two marvelously compelling characters, and a lot to say about human nature. It was painful to read at times, but that's because Ryan is such a great writer. She made me care about both protagonists so deeply that I felt it physically when they made mistakes or began to follow a path that I knew could only end badly. I am blown away by Glow. The best book I've read this year so far.Update: Working on writing my longer review of this one, and I'm reading others' reviews to see what they got out of it. I'm a little surprised to see that so many people see it as religion-bashing and atheist-glorifying when in fact I think Ryan did a remarkably even-handed job of \"demonizing\" both sides equally...we're never really sure which \"side\" is the right one (and just when we think we are, Ryan shows us we're wrong...or are we?). I think it might be natural for many people to automatically be on the defensive about their religion, meaning they completely miss the fact that the people on the \"no religion\" ship are equally sinister. The point of the book is how people use religion (or lack thereof) to manipulate people and gain power, not that religion/atheism is bad or good in itself.I plan on touching on this in my longer review, but I wanted to mention it now before I forgot.Also, this is NOT A DYSTOPIA.Full review here: http://www.stackedbooks.org/2011/09/g..."}, {"userName": "Rachel Hartman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4545538-rachel-hartman", "userReview": "[Waverly having invasive, non-consensual, egg-stealing surgery.

It\u2019s the sort of book that will make you miss your stop if you\u2019re reading it on public transport (always a sign of a good novel, I think). I\u2019ve never read anything quite this science fiction-y before; I\u2019ve never, ever read anything that takes place on a spaceship. I had wondered whether I\u2019d find it difficult to believe but I was thoroughly impressed. The spaceship setup is stunning. It is very well constructed and detailed, and I could easily imagine this enclosed fictitious society up in space. While I have absolutely no idea whether Amy Kathleen Ryan is accurate when she\u2019s talking about hulls and shuttles, it sounded pretty authentic to me.As for the plot, it\u2019s not as romance-centric as suggested by the cover tagline and the synopsis. It had been described to me as \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale set in space\u2019 and I did get that from the novel, which has the dystopian aspects of \u2018control over reproductive rights\u2019, fundamentalist religion and being held captive. This is a very loose comparison, however, and I\u2019m by no means saying that Glow is the YA version of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Nonetheless, it was extremely enjoyable. The novel switches between two viewpoints: Waverly and Kieran. Waverly is a strong-willed character and I found her to be much more interesting than her counterpart. I\u2019d personally even say she was a strong feminist character, which I think is important to note. I also felt like there was an underlining \u2018liberal\u2019 vs. \u2018conservative\u2019 debate in the story.I really wish I could give the novel the full five star rating, because opened me up to a whole new genre and is a fantastic addition to the YA science fiction that's out there at the moment, but the story was a little too slow for me in the middle when it stays on Kieran\u2019s perspective for a few chapters. I kept wishing it would switch back to Waverly\u2019s perspective. (But that's just me showing character favouritism!). I also wish that certain parts of the story could have been a bit more emotional, especially the situation with Waverly and the girls. I quite like crashing down, completely horrific, emotional wreck-type scenes!Overall, Glow encompasses genres that are extremely popular right now: a splash of dystopia, a hint of post-apocalyptic Earth, a slight love triangle, and interesting science fiction. I\u2019m that glad I had the opportunity to read and review Glow. I\u2019m only sad that it has a massive cliffhanger and I really wish we did not have to wait so long for the second book in the new Sky Chasers series.Thank you Macmillan Children\u2019s Books for sending me this book to review!I also reviewed this book over on Pretty Books."}, {"userName": "Crystal Starr Light", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light", "userReview": "Bullet Review:Thank you Nemo for your recommendation that I not sell this book and stick it out. I may not have read the physical book, but it made me want to pick up the audiobook, and while I didn't adore this to pieces, I did enjoy myself quite a bit.The long and short of it is: this book is incredibly dark but worlds better than most of the offerings you will find for Young Adults. Characters are realistic, there is some decent world-building, and the story is intriguing, if incredibly dark and for (IMO) the 16+ set. (Stealing underage girl's ova for an infertile population? The question of whether religion is evil because it is religion?) I would rate this better than the other scifi offering floating the cosmos, Across the Universe.Will I continue? My first instinct is to say no. I have loads of other books that need wading through, the story is mostly wrapped up (though plenty of room for expansion - thank GOD no cliffhanger endings!!), and honestly, I am not that enthused about reading a book where people are bad because they have religious beliefs, not based on their personal moral codes. My mind could change tomorrow, but today, I'll probably not finish the series. That doesn't mean this trilogy is bad, just that I have no personal desire to finish.3.5 stars and recommended if you want a darker, meatier scifi.Full Review:Waverly and Keiran are 15 and 16 respectively, the oldest children on a ship headed for a new Earth. Problems start to arise when the second ship of their convoy, the New Horizon, appears and whisks away the girls (including Waverly). Keiran and Seth, the pilot's angsty son, must try to keep the boys alive and the ship running (withOUT adults), while Waverly discovers a nasty secret on board the New Horizon, led by Pastor Ann Mather.I almost gave up on this one and would have were it not for a Goodread's friend's encouragement to keep it. So I found an audiobook (I read those faster) and added it to my 2014 challenge to weed through my huge TBR stack. I am really glad I listened to her advice, because this turned out a lot better than I had anticipated. In fact, it's a LOT better than most Young Adult offerings. To show why I liked it (and how it's better than most YA), please follow me with a nice list.How \"Glow\" Succeeds Where Other YA Fails:1) Teenagers act like teenagers. Waverly, Samantha, Felicity, Keiran, Seth, and more act like teenagers. They are afraid, smart, angry. They want their parents around to tell them that things will be okay. They want and do have sex. They can be brave when they need to be, but they also need to know that someone loves them. And some of them want to explore the world and NOT get married to the first set of abs their eyes set on.2) The romantic triangle does NOT dominate the story. There is a Romantic Triangle, those hideous creatures that make me run in terror. But here, it doesn't make me cringe at all. Why? Because the author gets it; she understands the purpose of a Romantic Triangle isn't to dominate the story. It's in the distant background - something the characters think about when they don't want to think about how sh!tty life is. It also includes wildly different characters, none of whom are perfect. THIS IS HOW YOU DO ROMANTIC TRIANGLES, PEEPS.3) The world doesn't fall apart when you gently poke at it. I'm not asking for a world in a Young Adult soft scifi novel to stand up to adult questions like, \"How does the economy work?\" and \"How can the ship get to the nearest star so quickly?\" I'm just asking for a bit more attention to detail than \"Look outside, there are STARS!\" No, the science isn't going to stand up to scrutiny, but at least it isn't going to fall apart on me as I read. Again, it's all about Willing Suspension of Disbelief.4) The story is more than just romance at its core. I know this is closely tied to #2, but let me explain. This story is about survival: survival of the boys in the ship, survival of the girls, survival of the human race on these ships. We also have a really compelling discussion about the place of religion - when does it become bad? Is it always bad? Can it ever be good? Keiran gets invigorated from adhering to religion, while Waverly (suffering from the evils of religion personified in Ann Mather) flees from it. In my reading, neither are wrong and neither are right. (Though it could be argued that you are supposed to side with Waverly who thinks all religion is cultish and bad - understandable based on her horrific experience on the New Horizon.) Compare this with 90% of YA out there, which is generic \"I want to love X, but I can't\" or \"I am super speshul, which boy should I fall in love with\".There is a lot to enjoy about this book, particularly if you want something meaty to discuss. But I don't think I'll continue.Reasons Why I'm Probably Not Going to Continue This Series:1) As a mildly religious person, I hate to see every religious person painted as a bad guy. Religion doesn't make a person evil; PEOPLE make themselves evil. Religion can give people an excuse to be horrible people (Westboro Baptist, anyone?), but you can't make a blanket statement saying \"All people who believe in X are bad\". (Unless you are Anne Rice, apparently...)2) While this book was better than most YA, it wasn't compelling enough to make me want to seek the end.3) I have SO MANY books in my to-read pile, and I don't own a copy of the sequels.4) I wasn't a fan of Keiran, nor of the boys' story to survive on the Empyrean.5) I thought it rather creepy and dark that the girls were violated as they were. Also, isn't it strange how they are wanted for their reproductive values and no more? While the boys fight to survive on a ship without adults who know what they are doing, the girls must fight to keep from being sexually violated. On one hand, it says a LOT about our society; on the other, couldn't we have a story where BOTH boys and girls must face the \"Lord of the Flies\" scenario, instead of shoving the girls into the stereotypical \"We need you to make da babehs\"?This is not to say the book is bad; in fact, if you have a hankering for Young Adult scifi, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. And maybe one day when I have my to-read pile under control (HAHAHAHAHAHAAA!), I'll come back to this trilogy. But for now, I'll leave this series pleased, entertained, and enriched. 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Abby", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7621490-abby", "userReview": "Before I start this review, be warned. I read Insurgent AND The Princess Bride (two books which I consider masterpieces) right before this book, therefore this review may be a little harsh. But I believe this book warrants some harshness.1. Intelligent and Heroic Heroine: NOPESure, Waverly supposedly fulfills the new trend in YA, which is intense, kick-butt, troubled heroines, but I didn't get that from her. The depth needed to pull that off just wasn't there. I couldn't and didn't connect with her and all her decisions just seemed too 2-D. She altogether just felt way too flat.2. Sweet and Brave Hero: NOPEKieran, again, fell quite flat. I couldn't connect with him either. He was neither swoon-worthy nor terribly smart. I might have connected with him more if the true emotional sentences weren't sandwiched between spaceship talk that I (not much of a space dork) didn't quite understand. 3. Unique Setting and Original Plot: CHECKIt did accomplish this, because I thought the idea of a secular ship versus a religious ship was quite interesting. It was cool to see them react and interact with each other. I give props for that angle of it.4. Extraordinary Supporting Characters: NOPENone of the supporting characters stuck out to me. They just seemed like names on the page, rather than people to be read about.5. Plot Twists and Action: CHECKI did find the action scenes to be well written and sort of awesome. Also, there were some unexpected occurrences that I didn't see coming (I wouldn't necessarily call them plot \"twists\", because the plot remained somewhat predictable.)All-in-all it had a lot of potential in the concept of it, but the 2-D characterization sort of ruined it for me."}, {"userName": "Steph Su", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2010935-steph-su", "userReview": "Uh, WOW. And not a good wow. I only got about 50 pages in before I realized that there was no way, except maybe by gunpoint, that I was going to be able to finish this book. This reads like someone threw a lot of money at a person and was like, here, indulge in writing something that contains a love triangle, a spaceship, big bad evil doo-doo men, and sexual desire. The problem with starting with these requirements, of course, is that they are not allowed to develop naturally out of inevitable beliefs and actions of the characters. Reading the invasion scene was like envisioning a transcript of an elementary school play about scary, scary aliens invading a spaceship.Look: I know that there have been scores of past civilizations that have done this sort of \"raping and pillaging\" thing--but what happens in one of the first scenes of GLOW is so far removed from tense believability as to be comical. Minus the theoretical sexual desire (a mostly-male spaceship kidnaps the other spaceship's girls in order to foster increased opportunities for procreation), this could've totally been a play put on by second-graders. Those little kiddies sure would love the scenes of pillage and fighting.Shame it had such a pretty cover."}, {"userName": "Keertana", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7584700-keertana", "userReview": "I read Glow with my heart caught in my throat, flipping pages frantically and waiting for the sick feeling in my stomach to evaporate. Even after having finished this book, though, my heart hasn\u2019t found its way back to my chest; I find it hard to breathe. For all the trouble it gave me, however, Glow has been one of the most satisfying novels I\u2019ve come across this year. Amy Kathleen Ryan\u2019s unapologetic prose and savage characters are the unpretentious realities I seek in a thought-provoking novel and, if nothing else is guaranteed, it is this: Glow will turn your mind inside-out and force you to re-think everything you thought you knew about humanity. Waverly and Kieran are barely sixteen-years-old, but they\u2019re already considering marriage. As the first generation of children born on the Empyrean, a spaceship that set off for New Earth decades ago, it is their duty to ensure the continuity of the human race. Kieran, already groomed to become the next Captain, is the perfect choice and, despite a few misgivings, Waverly is prepared to do her duty. When the New Horizon, however, the sister-spaceship that set off a year before the Empyrean, looms into view, Waverly and Kieran\u2019s lives are changed forever. After all, the New Horizon should be millions \u2013 if not billions \u2013 of miles ahead of the Empyrean, so the fact that they have slowed down their vessel to help the Empyrean catch up spells trouble. And trouble it is. When these two spaceships first set out from Earth, their chances of survival were the same. In fact, the only difference remained the religious beliefs of their crew members. Yet, while the Empyrean solved the fertility issue plaguing their crew, the New Horizon didn\u2019t. Thus, with no children aboard their ship \u2013 and therefore no one to carry forth their legacy \u2013 the Empyrean falls under attack, one hundred and thirty girls rounded up and kidnapped while dozens of adults fall dead, struggling to defend them. Alone on a spaceship with boys of various ages, Kieran is lost. And alone on a strange vessel, with a dictator named Anne Mather, all Waverly knows is that she must escape \u2013 before they touch her.Glow brings forth a future vision that is both startling and eerie. Not only is Ryan\u2019s world-building impeccable and intricately paced, but it is impossible to find a loop hole within the dystopian world she was built. Moreover, the story itself is nothing short of terrifying: a horror-story of human capabilities when pushed to the utmost degree of sanity. Anne Mather, the obvious \u201cvillain\u201d of our tale is manipulative and charismatic \u2013 deadly traits to work against \u2013 but Ryan imbibes an entire back story to her existence that makes it impossible to view her in a stark black-and-white light. What makes Glow such a remarkable piece, though, is the fact that Ryan is willing to create unlikeable characters. On the Empyrean, Kieran believes he must lead the remaining crew, particularly as he would someday become Captain. As he begins assuming power, though, he finds opposition in the form of Seth, an abused, but intelligent, teen who has remained jealous of Kieran\u2019s position, status, and engagement to Waverly. As Seth rises to power, undermining Kieran and finding fault with his actions, Kieran fails to achieve what he set out to do. Yet, as the situation aboard the Empyrean becomes increasingly frantic, wrought with shifting allegiances between Seth and Kieran, the true nature of both teenagers becomes apparent. Our loyalties, too, move back-and-forth, sympathizing with one boy and then the next as more and more is revealed. Thus, by the end, it is impossible to discern who is better, who is worse, and who is justified in what they did. Ryan blurs these lines and her stark, direct prose only serves to muddle our brain. After all, without the author telling us who to root for \u2013 without her bias leaking through the words \u2013 are we siding with a villain or a hero?Waverly\u2019s case, though different, also has its share of similarities. Stuck on the New Horizon, she must team up to escape Anne Mather \u2013 and fast. After all, Mather has made no secret of the fact that the girls have been chosen for their gender; nothing more. It is a shocking situation, particularly as the crew of the New Horizon supports Mather and dares not look too closely at how she handles her power, as long as they finally get what they\u2019ve wanted for so long: children. While Mather\u2019s cruelty is apparent through Waverly\u2019s struggles \u2013 many of which left me gasping in outrage \u2013 I admired the subtle messages Ryan was able to weave through the narrative. Waverly, as well as many of the other girls, have been subject to sexual harassment in the form of lingering looks or the equivalent of wolf whistles. While Glow isn\u2019t necessarily a feminist piece, the trials and tribulations that women have had to suffer from the discomfort of sexual harassment and other forms of sexual violence are outlined vividly, further blurring the lines between right and wrong as Ryan explores the decisions taken by these victims and the morality of those choices.Ultimately, Glow is an intense, dark novel. Ryan\u2019s characters may be teenagers, but the content of this novel is in no way adolescent. It is, solely, for mature readers who are looking for a story to make them think, reflect, and ponder. With just one book, Ryan has shot up to become a favorite author of mine; her writing is evocative, characters complex, and final message poignant. No stone is left unexplored in this psychological study of humanity, which I appreciate. Glow is proof that the Young Adult genre can transcend its artificial barriers of romance, delivering a novel that is worthy to be read, shared, and discussed with readers of all ages.You can read this review and more on my blog, Ivy Book Bindings."}, {"userName": "Trudi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3217375-trudi", "userReview": "Oh, why did I believe the lie that this book could possibly be like The Hunger Games? With a cliff hanger at every chapter, and a love triangle that had you holding your breath? No! It's all lies I tell you! *feels betrayed*. I say the truth, right on the back of the book, it says so. In all caps may I add. Maybe if that stupid statement on the back hadn't been there, maybe, just maybe, I would of given it more of a chance...but, sadly, without The Hunger Games on the back of the cover, enticing readers to look thru it's pages...it's just another three star read (for me at least). The love triangle. I really don't know WHY there is even one. Kieran get's all religious, which makes Waverly upset, so she goes off into the orchard and starts sucking on dirt (seriously, that really happened). Seth is a bad boy, which Waverly finds attractive I guess, but he is too bitter and cruel. I just say, ditch them both and live a lonely life all by yourself on a OneMan. Problem solved. Who is bad...who is good?I still don't know. We aren't suppose to know. Kieran suddenly gets all religious, which makes Waverly mad, because she is an athiest, but Kieran, is he suppose to be bad? Because the people on the New Horizon are bad and all religious, but I agree with Kieran on some of the things he says, which makes me think that Waverly's point of view is suppose to be right, but I don't agree with her point of view so I'm on the bad peoples side, but Kieran isn't like the other people on the New Horizon, they are bad, but Kieran isn't. Which makes Seth mad, and Waverly mad. OMGoodness I'm losing my MIND! I don't get it. I don't want to get it. *shakes head*The plot...Everything was so fast paced, over crowded, and I just felt lost. It was horrible, just horrible what happened to Waverly, and all the other girls. So horrible, I almost cried. Ryan addressed issues in this book like how important a baby's life is when it's endangering the mother? Being pro-life, under no circumstances should a baby be aborted. None. And those strange ways people get pregnant now a days? Totally screwed up. I see it on the news almost everyday, and it's not the baby's fault, it's the parents, who instead of adopting, they want to create a human life thru in vitro fertilization :\\Overall, will I read the second installment? I might. Maybe. Do I recommend it? Oh sure, why not? If you like Sci-fi love triangles, and confusion. Oh, fine...I'll give it 3.1 stars.

A space opera! I love space operas! It even had blurbs on the back comparing it to The Hunger Games, and a note from Lauren Myracle! PROMISING. That I started it the first night of ALA (in late June) and JUST finished it is probably a sign of how much this book did NOT enthrall me. 1) The timeline is horrendous. The story is told by dual narrators, but the narration doesn't alternate with each chapter. Instead, each narrator's story covers big chunks of time, which means by the time you get back to the first narrator, you're going BACK three months to find out what happened to the other person. Then, at the end of the book, one of the characters states a length of time that contradicts earlier times. I know, I know, ARC, but the haphazard way that the timeline is addressed is a huge flaw.2) The initial conflict makes no sense. Although you get some backstory later, the way that the other spaceship just decides to invade the other is contrived and the violence seems unwarranted.3) The adults are HORRIBLE caricatures. The kids aren't that bright either.4) Sometimes, the story seems like it's aimed at preteens. Other times, the characters swear and talk about feeling raped. There's a subplot about forced pregnancy. There's a Lord of the Flies type scenario. 4) The writing is bland and pedestrian. The plot summary describes an interesting book (a ship full of infertile women, led by a religious zealot, kidnaps the girls its sister ship in order to ensure their future; the boys left behind on the main ship are sans adults and devolve into Lord of the Flies) but much of what could actually drive the story (especially Kieran's story) takes place off the page. Waverly's story is a bit better developed, but it is still full of head-smacking moments.I know that I can be harsh on books, but this was particularly non-redemptive. I will not look forward to the next volume in this series.

Our two main characters, Kieran and Waverly, are on one of those ships. So as you may have deduced, this novel is a sci-fi/dystopian. Don\u2019t you just love those? I do. Ever since I read Across the Universe I have been fascinated by the genre, and I was so excited when I received this ARC in the mail. As predicted, Glow did not disappoint \u2013 I absolutely ravished it. The story is told in two points of view \u2013 Kieran and Waverly\u2019s \u2013 and in alternating parts. We are first introduced to The New Horizon, where Kieran and Waverly are the eldest children. They are greatly favoured, as previously to them being born, the females of the ship had been infertile. I won\u2019t go into too much detail about that, because there is so much to be explained and explored, and I wouldn\u2019t want to ruin any potential surprises! Something inevitably goes wrong, and causes Waverly and her boyfriend Kieran to be separated. I, for one, was quite looking forward to the change in status, but anyway, let\u2019s continue. The main story arc of the book was excellently dealt with; there were many twists and turns throughout the plot, and lots of action scenes thrown in! The plot was fast moving, yet I didn\u2019t have any trouble keeping up with what was going on. There were some time jumps, but these were almost perfectly well managed, and stayed very consistent throughout the parts. Most of all, I loved the world building. You all know I love dystopias, and this is possibly one of the best I\u2019ve read so far. The little details were brilliantly though out and executed, and I loved that everything had relevance within the story. I\u2019d also like to add that I was extremely impressed by the villain. Without mentioning any names, I thought our villain in this book was brilliant. The reasons for the villainous acts were well put across, and you could really tell that nothing was done without cause. Simply amazing.Waverly, our heroine, was fantastic. She was strong willed, and didn't let anything bring her down. Instead of whining on about how bad her life had suddenly become, she strived to help the others on the ship and to plot a way to get back to Kieran. That said, I liked the fact that Amy Ryan hadn\u2019t made her to be too tough. Things affected her, and circumstances changed her. She had great character growth and her development right until the end of the novel was clear. As for Kieran... Meh. Usually it\u2019s the girl that annoys me, but Kieran was an awful character. I really wasn\u2019t interested in his relationship with Waverly, and I do not think they are suited in the slightest. Waverly was such a strong character, and I feel that Kieran put her down. His whining especially got on my nerves, along with the preaching.  In fact, I\u2019m rather looking forward to seeing more of Waverly and Seth, and hopefully seeing something form between them. Yes, I know Seth is a bit of a bugger, but he\u2019s significantly better than Kieran and I think Waverly will do Seth good.And to top all of that awesomeness off, Amy Ryan\u2019s writing style was impeccable. There were a couple of scenes in which I could feel the character\u2019s pain physically, for example in one scene, someone pulls an IV out of their arm and then has to put it back in. This scene and the descriptions just left me cringing; it was awful and yet amazing at the same time. This rarely happens to me whilst reading.I definitely recommend this book to sci-fi and dystopian fans. I\u2019d also like to recommend it to everyone else, whether you\u2019re a fan of politics, family relationships, religion, or none of the above. You can just ignore the fact that it\u2019s set in space, because I can guarantee you are probably going to love this book!"}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3603005-amber", "userReview": "Rating: 3.5I went into reading Glow with an open mind. I was intrigued for sure and the synopsis had a good lure to it to make me want to see what it was all about. I was happily surprised by the outcome. The concept was interesting enough to keep me engaged in the book and the characters were interesting enough. There were some thoughts that kept popping up along the way. I started questioning how big the ship really was and as I kept reading through various scenes, I came to the realization that this ship must be humungous! If this thing has combine machinery, hay to bail and they house forests etc. it has to be huge. I was a little disturbed by some of the actions of the captain on the New Horizon. (Can\u2019t give away the details) Also, why would the 2 boys that know the ship best, leave on a rescue mission leaving the others there alone and knowing the engines were set to come back on??I like how the author switches POV\u2019s with Kieran and Waverly. You got a good deal of detail as to what they were facing, the struggles and emotions they encountered. If you worry about a love triangle..nah, very minimal where that is concerned. Characters:I like how the characters were written and developed throughout the book. Waverly was a great protagonist. She had courage, wit and I loved how she never gave up, even on crucial times, she seemed to be able to pull through. Kiernan is on the shorter side, slight build, well coordinated and strong for his size\u2026also, he has \u201cAmber\u201d eyes. ;) He didn\u2019t sweep me off my feet but was still a good character. Seth was more handsome, taller, and broader in the shoulders and has laser blue eyes. Who couldn\u2019t love those! He seems more of a rough guy but I think he does have a softer side to him. The secondary characters were pretty vital in the writing of this book. There were a lot of them but they were significant. Overall: I enjoyed this book. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say it was a Sci-Fi book alone. There was a hint of that in there. By the time I finished this book I was left feeling the need for more. I am interested what the author will come up with for the next installment.

Wowowowowow. People complain that there's not much true sci-fi in YA nowadays... HERE IT IS! The space aspects of this book were realistic, the setting and logistics of things like how gravity would work on a spaceship that's traveling for years and years, and how two separate ships can rendezvous in space and the effects of travel on women with regards to fertility, motherhood... Everything about the setting in this felt real to me (though I am not a rocket scientist, so maybe it could be technically off -- but the important thing is that there was enough detail to FEEL realistic).On top of that, every character was well-rounded -- you don't have the usual 2-dimensional YA villains here, and there's no clear black-and-white good-and-bad sides. Plus it deals with some religious elements, something I think much modern YA shies away from. I admire the author for tackling those issues, and issues like feminism in a world where if you don't reproduce, your entire species will die off. And she did it in a way that does not sound preachy, or choose sides. She presents both points of view, and you can draw your own conclusions. That's what great writing should do.Seriously, I cannot recommend this book highly enough for anyone who loves science fiction.

Their mission is to repopulate the human race and begin a prosperous new planet. They have been travelling for years, and the first generation of children to be born in space are entering their late-teens, and are almost ready to start marrying and procreating.Kieran and Waverley are just such a couple. Sixteen-year-old Kiernan is the ship\u2019s \u2018golden boy\u2019 \u2013 the first baby born after years of infertility; he is the product of intense genetic research, and the first successful conception for the new space frontier.Waverley knows that she and Kiernan will marry. It\u2019s what\u2019s expected of the oldest boy and girl aboard the Empyrean. And Waverley does love Kieran, and has ever since they were children. But when he starts talking marriage and babies, Waverley can\u2019t help but feel decisions slipping away from her, and expectations weighing heavy on her shoulders.And then the New Horizon looms.The New Horizon is the sister-ship which embarked on the race to save humanity with the Empyrean all those years ago . . . but the Empyrean inhabitants have not seen sight of the New Horizon for light years, and are curious as to why their fellow voyagers are so eager to board . . .What starts as friendly negotiations quickly deteriorates into a hostile take-over that sees New Horizon passengers forcibly board the Empyrean. But it\u2019s not the ship they want \u2013 all they are interested in is the children \u2013 specifically, the girls.\u2018Glow\u2019 is the first book in a new sci-fi young adult series called \u2018Sky Chasers\u2019 by Amy Kathleen Ryan.It may be a clich\u00e9, but space really is the final frontier \u2013 for the dystopian genre, at least.The young adult genre has looked at dystopia from just about every angle \u2013 as a bloodthirsty media-driven sport in Suzanne Collins\u2019s \u2018The Hunger Games\u2019, a World War III disaster in John Marsden\u2019s \u2018Tomorrow\u2019 series and the more traditional censored/watched society of Ally Condie\u2019s epic \u2018Matched\u2019. So it makes sense that dystopian authors are branching out and looking up; setting their sights on mankind\u2019s next conquest \u2013 space.Beth Revis kicked the year off with her sci-fi thriller foray \u2018Across the Universe\u2019. And now Amy Kathleen Ryan gives us a dystopian space opera extraordinaire which I am already predicting will be a major appearance on many 2011 favourite\u2019s lists.\u2018Glow\u2019 is immense and thrilling. The human drama kicks-off immediately as we meet Kiernan and Waverley on the day that their world changes forever. It starts with a proposal of marriage \u2013 a sweet gesture that somewhat frightens Waverley and leaves her feeling boxed-in . . . to the point that she finds herself momentarily day-dreaming about an old childhood \u2018almost\u2019 crush on the temperamental pilot\u2019s son, Seth Ardvale. We also learn of Kieran\u2019s revered \u2018golden boy\u2019 status as the first successful conception aboard the Empyrean \u2013 a twist of fate that sees him being groomed for the captaincy.All of this human drama and personal chaos is woven into the very first pages. Ryan divulges a lot of subtle information about on-board power struggles and personal. Looking back, Ryan does most of her character-building very concisely in these first introductory scenes \u2013 but her writing is so seamless and happily immersive that as a reader you never feel inundated.Ryan needed to establish characters very quickly \u2013 because the book\u2019s plot is set at full-throttle and never lets up. Very early on in the book the real action kicks in and separates all of the characters \u2013 so we read the alternating narratives from both Kiernan and Waverley as one is kidnapped and the other left behind to mutiny. And that\u2019s where things get interesting and dystopic. . .Ryan has packed so much into \u2018Glow\u2019 \u2013 simply by splitting the narrators apart and writing very different versions of dystopia for both of them. Really, \u2018Glow\u2019 is two dystopias in one. An impressive accomplishment and no mean feat.Waverley\u2019s journey takes her on board the New Horizon, along with all of her captured female friends \u2013 teenage girls and toddlers alike. The New Horizon has no captain, only a Pastor by the name of Anne Mather. Mather is a kindly-looking, grandmotherly sort with a sinister agenda. God is on her side and the Empyrean girls are merely vessels through which to accomplish her zealous promise to bring new life to the New Horizon.Anne Mather is, without a doubt, one of the best villains I have ever read. She is cunning and cruel \u2013 disarmingly sweet, until someone crosses her. She is made even more terrifying for her religious fervour, which borders on maniacal.Waverley\u2019s time on the New Horizon is really an exploration of ideals \u2013 and the danger of blind faith. It is on this vessel that Ryan explores the dystopia of religion \u2013 not in a blameful or anti-religious way . . . she is merely observing what happens when human beings who have no hope find salvation in one person\u2019s proclamations \u2013 and the lengths those people will go to uphold their beliefs.\u201cOh, I guess because I\u2019m jealous.\u201d \u201cJealous? Why?\u201d For a long time Amanda didn\u2019t answer; she just stroked the canvas with charcoal. \u201cI wanted to be one of the first mothers of New Earth. I thought it was my destiny.\u201d Waverley said nothing. \u201cBut you\u2019ll get to. You\u2019ll be a progenitor of thousands, maybe millions of colonists on New Earth. You\u2019ll be celebrated and remembered by an entire planet full of people. Like Eve in the Garden of Eden. Well, you and the rest of the girls.\u201d \u201cI never thought about it that way,\u201d Waverley said. A chill passed over the backs of her shoulders. \u201cWhen you think about it, it\u2019s almost your duty, if you know what I mean. To be a mother.\u201dMeanwhile, onboard the Empyrean the boys are left behind. The girls have been taken \u2013 their friends, sisters, and girlfriends all gone. The adults are in serious danger, and it\u2019s left to the young boys to fend for themselves and steady the ship. But power struggles quickly surface \u2013 Kieran\u2019s control is questioned and he finds himself in a battle of sabotage against Seth Ardvale. It is onboard the male-run Empyrean that Ryan\u2019s dystopia devolves into human power struggles \u2013 like a \u2018Lord of the Flies\u2019 outbreak, it is a look at what happens when greed and power corrupt the mind.Both of Ryan\u2019s dystopian explorations \u2013 on two different space ships \u2013 are disturbingly intriguing and psychological. Honestly, the boy\u2019s Empyrean power-struggles could be likened to the infamous Stanford Prison experiment, while Waverley\u2019s New Horizon experience is almost a struggle against Stockholm syndrome. Ryan has really distilled her dystopia into a thrillingly complex look at humanity. And I can\u2019t wait for more \u2018Sky Chasers\u2019 books, as I think Ryan\u2019s future explorations will be into the creation of a dystopian society . . . from the ground \u2013up.Of course these vast dystopian explorations are all well and good \u2013 but what made this book into a page-turner for me were the character\u2019s individual struggles. Waverley is a brilliantly strong and steely character. Her hardships in \u2018Glow\u2019 are immeasurable, but her spirit is never easily broken and her fighting-spirit is tremendous. Likewise, Kieran started out as a cardboard cut-out hero (all dull and superior) but quickly developed into a complex and broken young man who was vastly more interesting for the challenges faced.And because Ryan sets up Kieran and Waverley\u2019s romance early on, it makes for a fantastic touchstone throughout the book. Both Waverley and Kiernan constantly come back to their love for one another \u2013 and their vow to keep searching for each other, and be reunited. But Ryan has also written an unfurling love triangle in the form of Seth Ardvale . . .I must admit, early on I was more intrigued by Seth than Kieran. I always like an under-dog and unlikely love-interest . . . and there was just something about the golden boy, Kieran, versus Seth\u2019s unpopular quick-temper that had me siding with Ardvale. For a while though, I thought that Ryan deliberately devolved Seth into a villain, rather than love interest. But Ryan\u2019s novel is more complex than that, her characters more gray. The books ends on an intense cliff-hanger \u2013 hinting that her characters are more multi-faceted than I originally gave them credit for.\u2018Glow\u2019 is a slice of stunning dystopic space operatic brilliance. Amy Kathleen Ryan\u2019s first \u2018Sky Chasers\u2019 book will have your blood pumping and fury surging as she writes two very different power struggles playing out onboard space ships destined for a new world order. \u2018Glow\u2019 is heart-wrenchingly brilliant, and it will most certainly be taking its rightful place on my 2011 favourite\u2019s list."}, {"userName": "Tuba Sayed", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42886196-tuba-sayed", "userReview": "Blah..."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/999233-laura", "userReview": "[I also didn\u2019t like violence in Kerian's ship and thought things got out of hand rather quickly.

I didn\u2019t get why he snapped \u2013 I felt like his character should have turned around and helped Kerian, but instead he became this evil and sinister guy who took over after they lost their adults. It seemed to violent and awfully messy to me.  I had been fine with most of the religious aspects up until the people on the other ship were being lead by a cult leader and they thought they were doing the will of God. It seemed a little close to home \u2013 even though the author was really good about being vague and not referencing anything in particular, I was just annoyed that the \u201creligious\u201d ship had such despair and corruption. I also didn\u2019t like how the lady in charge turned on everybody because of her strict beliefs. I\u2019m not saying that this can\u2019t happen, but I was just annoyed that it was the only solution. I was kind of annoyed because the people on the other ship weren\u2019t much better and the foreshadowing at the beginning didn\u2019t make it sound like things were going to turn out either. It bugged me that the was such corruption among both sides of the human groups on the two different ships.

I could give a lot of info about Glow and try to gloss over what I think. But I don't really have the energy or the inclination to do that. I'm just gonna say it. I don't know how I feel about this book. And the worst part is, I can't even tell you why. As a matter of fact, I threw out a lifeline on Twitter this morning. I needed some help. My good friend Kara at Great Imaginations responded. The conversation went like this:@BookishAndrea: \"Can someone please tell me how I felt about Glow? I need to write a review and  I'm confused...\"@Kara_Malinczak: \"LOL that seems to be a common reaction. I wouldn't know. I haven't read it yet.\"@BookishAndrea: \"I liked it. Then I didn't. Then I was bored. Then excited. Then I rolled my eyes.  then tearful. Then 'Blah'. There's my review.@Kara_Malinczak: \"It sounds like a perfect review. LOL\"So. That, in a nutshell, is how I felt about Glow. I didn't hate it. In fact, there were parts that I downright enjoyed. And I even got a little teary-eyed at the end. But, I didn't love it, or even like, a lot of the book. I don't know if this is the case (I certainly hope not) , but I almost felt as if the author didn't know what the \"message\" of the story was. At first it felt like an adventure in deep space. Then an allegory on religion. Then a cautionary tale on cults. Or what being on a space ship for dozens of years will do to people. And perhaps, it is meant to be all of those. And that's okay. It's just not for me. I was also bothered by the characters. Waverly was great. She was brave and proud and honorable. But Kieran, I felt like the whole book was building him up as one idea, getting the reader on his side. Then, almost as an afterthougt, throw something out of left field. Turn him into a crazy. And Seth. He starts the book nice. Then goes ape-sh*t crazy. He turns into a dictator and abuses little boys. And then, at the end, he's the good guy?! I don't think so. I don't like to go off and rant and rave about what I don't like about books. I really, really don't. Something about this one just set me off. And I'm sorry. There are lots of people who like Glow. So I've linked to some reviews so you can see for yourself. Here's one by Miranda and another by Amber . Favorite Quote:\" All the boys were looking at him now.
