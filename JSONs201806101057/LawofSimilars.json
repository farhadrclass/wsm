This book reminded me of reading the train wreck that was The House of Sand and Fog. Lots of people making a lot of stupid decisions. People being entirely selfish. Not a single character you can actually admire or respect. I don't think this book has a single redeeming feature. It is awfully similar to Midwives (in terms of general plot), and I wonder if the author was just trying to borrow from the successes of that book. I enjoyed Midwives, and I'd feel okay recommending it to people. Since that time, I've read two other books by this author, and I've just got to say- read Midwives if you want, but avoid his other books at all cost!I saw it on the library shelf, and I thought it had a nice title...

Now that I've finally gotten around to it, I'm sorry I waited so long. This is the best kind of \"gripping tale\" that book jacket copy is always promising us. It's a thriller, but not a sensational one. These are ordinary people in ordinary circumstances -- no government conspiracies or serial killers to plump up the plot. It's just a convincingly complicated tale about bad decisions compounded by lust, loneliness and desperation. He tells us right up front that the protagonist has done something bad, but then conjures up a character so appealing that you can't help but root for him anyway. Bohjalian's writing is so good that my heart raced and my stomach roiled with dread as I turned the pages, waiting for the moment when Leland's tangled web of lies would give way beneath him.

Serves me right for automatically wanting to like a character just because of his circumstances, in this case the fact that he was a widower with a small child. Turns out he was a selfish, obsessive, hypochondriac who made one bad choice after another from the beginning of this book to the end. The plot itself is compelling whether or not a homeopath is responsible for the death of a patient. The \"drama\" created by Leland was absolutely ridiculous. He sacrifices his job, his health and compromises himself as a father all because he thinks he's falling in love with his homeopath. REALLY??? What is he 15?

But in the end, it just didn't deliver for me. The introduction of Richard Emmons earlier in the story was choppy and not at all fluid. There was much jumping back and forth but the transitions weren't handled well. The idea of a homeopath dating a state's attorney who then finds herself potentially libel for a patient's negative reaction and complicating her relationship with the attorney was very interesting. It could've delved more into the legal aspects, but didn't. I also felt like the ending was a cop-out. How did the author resolve these things?

It seemed to end a little abruptly - I expected there to be a lot more story there. Maybe he had a deadline and had to wrap it up, haha.

It is really sad that the Richard character was banned from having more of the so-called 'cure', and driven to his tragic self-experimenting.

Several years later I read another of his books and enjoyed it as much as the first, but it\u2019s taken me another year to read another. This third book piqued my interest because it deals with the science of homeopathy, a healing art that I briefly researched in college and have maintained an interest in ever since.I enjoyed this book, if more for the storyline and its believability than for the writing. This is the story of a mid-30s widowed father and public attorney in Vermont who comes down with a cold that lasts for well over six months, and for which he desperately turns to a local homeopath for a cure. What follows is the story of how his experience with homeopathy varies so widely from another man\u2019s experience and interpretation of how homeopathy heals on the principle that \u201clike cures like\u201d, and the aftermath of allowing himself to fall in love for the first time since his wife died.What distracted me from the story was Bohjalian\u2019s repeated use of the phrase, \u201cAnd so\u201d. He not only uses this two-word combination in the middle of his sentences, but also when beginning sentences and paragraphs, and with a frequency that made me cringe every time I saw it written yet again. I\u2019m probably only sensitive to this because I tend to use that phrase to begin my own sentences in my own writing, but the difference between us is that I write casual and widely unread blog posts, and this is a novel in which more formal writing is called for and is deserved. If I hadn\u2019t read other, better formed, works by Bohjalian this detail alone might have turned me off of reading anything else by him, and I believe that he has since corrected this issue, given that this book was published over a decade ago. Don\u2019t let my editorial criticism of this small detail keep you from reading this book, though. If you\u2019ve read and enjoyed any of Jodi Picoult\u2019s works, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll also enjoy books by Bohjalian, as they cover many of the same legal/medical parameters that she often centers her books around"}, {"userName": "Tom Hooker", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2404072-tom-hooker", "userReview": "Most books have a main character who is good and who does good things throughout the book. Bohjalian's book, \"The Law of Similars\" is a bit like watching a train wreck as the reader morbidly watches a very sympathetic main character risk disassembling his life and career before our eyes. Leland Fowler is an assistant state attorney whose wife was killed in a tragic car accident two years before. He bravely continues, working as a single father to raise his daughter, and to do good work in the state attorney's office. But inside, he's falling apart. Then he meets a young woman, a homeopath, who gives him a homeopathic remedy with amazing results. But he falls in love with her, and she with him. Shortly after, one of her patients suffers anaphylactic shock after eating a cashew (which he's deathly allergic to). He lapses into a coma. The man's wife believes the homeopath encouraged him to do this, and she contacts the state attorney's office to try to file criminal charges. Leland instructs the homeopath on how to answer the state attorney's questions, and helps her rewrite her file notes to cover what Leland perceives is her potential liability, all the while concealing his relationship with her."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4766788-sue", "userReview": "Probably I would not have picked up this book had my Book Group not been reading and discussing it later in the week.

Despite the fact that I got a bit irritated with them at times - after all, Leyland is a bit of a hypochondriac and Carissa can be a little intense.

It's the story of a well-trained modern midwife who performs and emergency cesarean section on a woman she believes has died of a stroke during childbirth. But what if the woman she thought was dead wasn't, and she herself caused the fatal injury? The novel examines the debate over alternative medicine through a gripping personal account of tragedy. I devoured this book, and developed an instant love for the author. I would have read the phone book if he wrote it!Fast forward a few years and I am thrilled to find a copy of Bohjelian's The Law of Similars on GoodReads. By this point I've read several of Bohjelian's books, and loved each and every one. The Law of Similars was sure to be another home run for Bohjelian, as far as I was concerned. I didn't even know the plot line, but it didn't matter-I wanted it!Well, here's what it's about. The patient of a homeopath named Carissa Lake dies after eating a nut to which he knew he was allergic. His wife believes that Carissa told him to do it, and she tries to get the District Attorney's office to file murder charges against Lake. An assistant DA, Leland Fowler, widower and single father, is first assigned to hear the story from the dead man's wife, but there is a problem. He's been seeing Carissa Lake-both as a homeopathy patient and as a date. His feelings for her cause an ethical dilemma that will challenge everything.Alternative medicine? Patient dies? Malpractice? Sound familiar?Apparently, there is a belief in homeopathy that taking a small amount of something that causes the same symptoms you have will actually make the symptoms stop by jump starting your body's own healing processes. It's called the law of similars-and provided a very apt title for this book. I was stunned that the story was so similar to Midwives. I've read books by this author on transgenderism, foster parenting, gun control, and sexual assault. Bohjelian is not a one trick pony, telling only one story over and over again. What happened here? And The Law of Similars, published in 1999, wasn't even written that long after Midwives. If I thought the two stories were pretty much the same after 13 years, surely after only two years the author himself must have noticed what was happening. I will say, the book itself was interesting and well-written, as always. Bohjelian's characters are always so well-written. Even when I don't agree with their motives I find myself understanding their perspective. I learned a lot about homeopathy from this novel, and while I'm still not sure how I feel about it at least I have some insight into the underlying philosophy. Leland's character especially moved me-a single father who lost his wife to a car accident, the scenes with his daughter were so tender, and the fact that he was so obviously at a loss about how to move on from the tragedy made him imminently sympathetic. I can't say that I dislike the book-I devoured it just like Bohjelian's other books-but why two books with such similar topics? I suppose only he can answer that question."}, {"userName": "William Au", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3417416-william-au", "userReview": "\"The Law of Similars\" is an astonishing novel about the hardships Leland Fowler faces when he loses his wife in a car crash, leaving him with grief and his young daughter.  The most pleasurable aspect of this book is definitely the character development of Leland. Chris Bohjalian develops Leland's character very uniquely by using Leland himself; everything he does and thinks constantly revealing more to Leland's character throughout the entire book. \"I raise my daughter. I go to work. And though some days it is very hard, I try not to live for the future. And I try not to dream of the past\"(Bohjalian, 330), is what Leland says resolutely after going through every emotion possible such as grief, despair, infatuation, it really shows how his character evolves after many life experiences and it becomes something everyone can relate to which makes this one of the most enjoyable element of the novel.  An intriguing aspect of the book would be the use of homeopathy. Like cures like, the law of similars which is the basis of homeopathy, the same method of treatment Carissa Lake use to cure Leland\u2019s cold and sore throat. The intriguing part of homeopathy is that the cure didn\u2019t only help his cold, but it had given him a boost of confidence. This allowed Chris Bohjalian to use the effects of homeopathy as a catalyst for romance as Leland\u2019s new found courage became the starting point with his relationship with Carissa Lake. Using the combination of love and non-traditional medicine, Chris cunningly turns Leland's frown upside down and allows us to look past all the grief and despair of Leland\u2019s character, the other side to him.  I strongly recommend this book especially if you enjoyed reading Chris Bohjalian\u2019s other novel \u201cMidwives.\u201d The two novels written by Chris may seem very similar including the unfortunate deaths leading on to legal trouble but it is extraordinarily different as each person reacts differently even in the same situation. I see the different reactions as Chris Bohjalian\u2019s intention as he writes amazing books about people in difficult situations."}, {"userName": "Sharon Metcalf", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf", "userReview": "Two years ago Elizabeth Fowler died suddenly after being involved in a motor vehicle accident.

He struggles to find the balance between his work as chief deputy states attorney as a prosecutor and raising his precious girl. His health has been suffering, not in a big way but he's had a cold he cant shake and decides to see a homeopath.

The wife of the other patient strongly believes Clarissa is responsible and fully intends to see her pay. The ill-formed decisions he makes, the actions they take and lies that are spun left me feeling anxious about what might result, what the ultimate consequences might be.

The best parts of the book were the educational segments on homeopathy, and I loved that he makes the point that although many of the drugs used by homeopaths are poisons, such as arsenic, belladonna or tarantula venom, so is chemotherapy being used today. This book reminded me of Midwives, but I think Midwives was much better written."}], "description": "The Law of Similars is fast-paced and absorbing. Few writers can manipulate a plot with Bohjalian's grace and power.\"-\"The New York Times Book Review\" From the number one bestselling author of Midwives comes this riveting medical thriller about a lawyer, a homeopath, and a tragic death. When one of homeopath Carissa Lake's patients falls into an allergy-induced coma, possibly due to her prescribed remedy, Leland Fowler's office starts investigating the case. But Leland is also one of Carissa's patients, and he is begining to realize that he has fallen in love with her. As love and legal obligations collide, Leland comes face-to-face with an ethical dilemma of enormous proportions. Graceful, intelligent, and suspenseful, The Law of Similars is a powerful examination of the links between hope and hubris, love and deception.\"From the Trade Paperback edition.", "title": "Law of Similars", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18117685-law-of-similars", "average": 3.67, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1410779016l/18117685.jpg", "reviews": 478, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3509.Chris_Bohjalian", "name": "Chris Bohjalian"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18117685-law-of-similars", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126812.The_Law_of_Similars", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2967978-the-law-of-similars", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5166.Midwives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13330603-the-sandcastle-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126807.The_Double_Bind", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2017056.Skeletons_at_the_Feast", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16099189-the-light-in-the-ruins"]}
