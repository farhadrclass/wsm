The narrative style is poor. The anecdotal style of the authors renders this text confusing. The book contains massive paragraphs of laundry-lists and name-dopping (making it hard to tell the difference between referenced theorists, activists and professionals from the authors' oft-mentioned group of friends), with some inspiring messages nestled so far inside the sprawling, useless prose that it is difficult to make them out. Jagged. Bothersome. Annoying. I have abandoned it.

It does a wonderful job thoroughly reviewing feminism from it's birth to the modern age.

Despite the authors' claim that they are trying to unite women of various generations, much of the book came off as personal attacks on various women - both self-proclaimed feminists and not.This was the first book I've read that defines and gushes over 'girly' culture, which is probably the aspect of feminism that I can most relate to but never had a name for. The author's are fairly positive about this particular 'wave' of feminism, while simultaneously backbiting some of the major publishing victories OF girly feminism. Some of the tips for activism do seem helpful, and the appendices and notes are very thorough. But much of the book seems to suffer from being so informally written with too many back-patting anecdotes from the authors, gratuitous name-dropping, and too many personal criticisms of others in the movement. Those continuous flaws throughout the book left an unpleasant taste in my mouth upon finishing it.As others have said, this isn't a bad \"Feminism 101 - The Year 2000\", but I think there are other books - many of which are mentioned in this one! - that are better examples of some of the Third Wave feminists and their points of view."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113324-robin", "userReview": "Blah. I had high hopes for this book and I was disappointed. The authors took about 280 pages to \"get to the point\" and start writing their manifesta. They spent most of the book talking about feminist magazines and feminist authors, etc. I kept thinking, why are they talking about media soooo much? Aren't there bigger issues than Ms. magazine's continued lack of commercial success? About 15-20 pages of the book were real content of what to do, how to do it, and why.The other thing that really grinds me up about this book is the continuous waffling. Oh, group a is feminist, and so is group b, and so is group c! We're all feminists! I'm not saying that feminists shouldn't be an inclusive group, but constantly going back and forth to qualify every statement for every possible person/group was tiring to read and weakened the point. Rather than focusing on all the differences between feminist groups, shouldn't we point out how we all want the same basic things?Overall, disappointing, boring, tedious. I wouldn't even call it feminism 101, I would call it feminist magazines and media 101. There are much better books out there."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74793-sarah", "userReview": "I made it about half way through this book- after two tries. The authors did a presentation at Hope, and I was impressed and interested. But it turns out that they toned themselves down quite a bit for their presentation at a (relatively) conservative college. I found the book pretty alienating.It was a while before I could call myself a \"feminist\" again.I want to be a feminist if that means that I believe that women should have all the same opportunities that men have. If that means that I get to be an equal partner with my husband. If that means that you have to treat me with respect. If it means that I get to decide for myself whether I'm going to stay home with babies all day. If it means that I question the images and ideas that society sends me.But the trouble is, Baumgardner and Richards make it about more than that.

A smile crept onto my face as I vaguely recalled adding this book to my collection of feminist materials around the time I decided to double major in Women\u2019s Studies. I never got around to reading it. Lately I\u2019ve been trying to connect my life, my ideologies, and current events (read: the election results) to the ideologies of the women who came before me. It\u2019s easy to have a disconnect of Now vs. Then, but I think it\u2019s so important to understand how others have affected change, what issues previous generations were struggling to overcome, and why. What I\u2019ve found is that we really aren\u2019t so different, when it comes down to it.Back in 2000, young women often called themselves \u201cnot a feminist but\u2026\u201d while the media declared that feminism was dead and that young people in general were politically apathetic. In Manifesta, Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards unpack this, from the public\u2019s misunderstanding of what feminism is about, to the media\u2019s proposal that the movement is dead in the water. In reality, young women are feminist, even when they don\u2019t claim the label; young feminists are out there, but the media doesn\u2019t show them. Manifesta didn\u2019t really tell me anything I didn\u2019t know, but it did give me a solid perspective on aspects of early-2000s feminism, a time when I, personally, was still grappling with whether or not I would ever grow noticeable breasts. The best part of this book, for me, was the chapter titled \u201cThou Shalt Not Become Thy Mother,\u201d wherein the authors grapple with the generational strife between Second and Third Wave Feminism. They tie together personal stories of mother-daughter relationships with the bigger picture. They talk about the concept of Martyr Moms, those moms who are everywhere, doing everything, sacrificing their time both in the workplace and in the home, and often become bitter at the lack of recognition. This really clicked with me, as my mother is the most naturally sacrificing person I know; no matter how much I reject her way of doing things, deep down we\u2019re not that different. Baumgardner and Richards argue the importance of repairing that mother-daughter relationship, both on a personal level and on a larger scale within the feminist movement: \u201cthe biggest conflict between the generations is a lack of communication, mutual ignorance of each other\u2019s accomplishments, and sometimes suspicion about each other\u2019s motivations.\u201d As I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve gained more respect for my mother\u2019s natural talents, her sacrificial nature, but I\u2019ve also recognized that, in her own way, my mom is a feminist. While my grandmother was concerned that my mom would end up dropping out of college to support my dad, instead they supported each other through school. At a time when the idea of an egalitarian marriage was a relatively new thing, my parents crafted a partnership that\u2019s still in existence today.By far the most valuable part of Manifesta is the chapter on activism. As the authors point out, it\u2019s a loosely defined idea that means different things to different people. \u201cActivism is everyday acts of defiance,\u201d they argue. \u201cActivism starts with the acknowledgement of injustice, but it doesn\u2019t stop with the rant, a declaration that something is rotten in the state of the patriarchy, or even with the manifesta.\u201d They encourage young women to get creative, to own their own ideas and take rational, effective action, providing many examples as well as ideas about what could be done better in the future. I\u2019m honestly glad I read Manifesta in 2017 rather than 2010. To be honest, I\u2019m glad I read Jessica Valenti\u2019s Full Frontal Feminism as my first so-called Third Wave text. While Baumgardner and Richards offer some great advice on how to get out there and do activism, as well as a unique perspective on Girlie Feminism, the Girls Movement, and generational strife, Manifesta isn\u2019t the all-encompassing \u201cintro to feminism\u201d book I imagined it would be. Nevertheless, a worthwhile read for anyone interested in feminism\u2019s recent history, as well as someone wanting to boost their feminist activism."}, {"userName": "Jordan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72931393-jordan", "userReview": "As someone who knew very little about feminist history, I had a lot to take from this book... however...This book really drags its feet getting to the point. It could have been so much shorter. This book took me a long time to complete because it was very mentally exhausting, jumping from point to point to point with very little cohesion. It was kind of fun at first, making the vibe of the book relaxed and conversational, but by the end I was ready for it to be over.I think I could recommend this book to people, but I might just recommend specific excerpts.

The idea behind the book is interesting of course, but I had a problem with the authors' narrative style and some word choice. Maybe it's me, but I find it disconcerting when feminists use the term \"abortionist(s),\" especially when said with a straight face. In my mind only crazy anti-abortion, pro-forced pregnancy people use that term to describe doctors who, in addition to providing other medical services to women, also perform abortions. \"Abortionist\" has a different, negative connotation. And the writing style itself didn't thrill me. Parts I skimmed over delved into so-called Girlie feminism of the early-mid 90's, seemed more interested in Bust than BITCH, and didn't have a problem with Katie Roiphe's The Morning After (setting it next to books like The Beauty Myth and pop-feminism instead of within backlash feminism). I love reading about the intersection of pop culture and feminism, but this felt, I don't know, a little smug. If you want a great collection of essays on pop culture and feminism, read BITCHfest, a collection of essays from the magazine's past 10 years.I also got caught up by the tone of \"we're going to tell you what GenX, Third Wave Feminism is all about, because WE are the coolest members, nay, initiators! of this ultra-cool movement!\" (Okay, I'm exaggerating, but not by much). Yes, I know it's a manifestA and all that, but from what I read it's not MY manifesta. I didn't feel like I was the target audience. It also felt dated to me; I lost interest when the authors spent a few too many pages going on about feminists and the (Bill) Clinton scandals. I remember the time period, but it's also too far away from me to care. Maybe I'll take a break from pseudo-academia for a while, read some good fiction, then come back to it much later."}, {"userName": "Ginger", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/358769-ginger", "userReview": "I have to say up front that I found the prologue, epilogue, and the first and last chapters very annoying and their conversational tone a poor cover for heavy-handed, pedantic writing. I'm sorry but the way they used words like righteousness and sister just made me cringe. And I think their use of swear words is conspicuous and awkward. To be fair, the book is 10 years old and I did enjoy much of the book. I enjoyed the middle chapters and their focus on recent feminist history and the role of young women in the feminist movement, which I know fairly little about. I liked reading about the development of Sassy, Jane, and Bust magazine. And even thought I've read Rebecca Walker and heard of Elizabeth Wurtzel and Naomi Wolf, Katie Roiphe, Kathleen Hanna and others were new to me. I think the best thing the authors did was explain and champion the complexity and diversity of the feminist movement, as well as to reassert the basic notion that being a feminist is not a radical thing. If you believe in fairness, equality, and the right of women to make their own personal decisions, you are a feminist. Feminism can be applied and used a lens in the same way that civil rights can be applied to all sorts of topics, movements, institutions, and ideas. What I took away from this book is the idea that concepts like feminism, civil rights, and environmentalism are large ideologies that encompass a lot of different people with different ideas, different approaches, and different priorities. They are difficult to define because they are not fixed or simple but complex ideas that shift, evolve, and include a wide array of voices."}, {"userName": "Chelsea", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122606-chelsea", "userReview": "It had it's moments, but nothing special. I knew it was outdated going in, but it showed, mainly through pop culture references - specifically discussions of zines rather than websites - and the glaring lack of any commentary on Hillary Clinton.

They certainly highlight all the low points, but they're not making anything up.Unfortunately, the prologue got me all good and fired up and then rest of the book meandered around, petered off, and finally got plain old boring.

Good intentions, but got caught up in their own stories too often. I read this book after hearing Amy talk as part of a CBC program about Feminism for International Woman's Day, and then discussed it with some friends.

Nah. I had to read this book as a textbook for one of my Women and Gender Studies' courses. I'm really glad I didn't have to read the whole thing, to be honest.Somehow in its Tenth Anniversary Edition, and yet very glaring and blatant misogynistic and racist blunders still haven't been edited out. Jennifer negating younger feminists to being \"Jell-O-shots versions of feminism\" being a very ironic statement, considering the numbers of this movement wholly rest on the younger generation (lets not even go into the devaluing of women's work because of their age!). Their 'dinner party' is a complete goddamn travesty, in my opinion, as I feel like either their words are exaggerated/twisted to fit the narrative, or these are shitty feminists. I mean, really, using the r-slur in the same sentence you're talking about dating women just because it'd be more convenient for you...? (\"Sometimes I think about dating women because the men I've met are so emotionally r*t*rd*d.\") Talking about cheating as if it's just something that happens....? (\"I fell much more comfortable flirting now that I'm married, as long as it's very clear that I am married...\") Just flat-out shitty biphobia that completely ignores the fact that bisexuals don't stop being bisexuals when they're not in same-sex relationships, and the fact that bisexuals are attracted to people who don't subscribe to the gender binary. (\"I think if you're bisexual, there just has to come a day when you choose one or the other- and, face it, it's easier to be straight...\").I mean, really, this book is riddled with biphobia (and this is just from the ~100 pages I've read of it)! \"Many bisexual women eventually choose to identify as either gay or straight.\" What, like bisexuals are Schrodinger's Sexuality, and can only be bisexual when they don't have any partner...? Yeah, if a bisexual settles down, they're gonna be with someone of some gender (or no gender).... That doesn't erase the fact that they're still bisexual- the gender of their partner has nothing to do with their sexuality. It's not choosing sides- stop acting like it is. Also, passive lesbophobia... Since Jennifer is bisexual, I'm honestly surprised as how much anti-Sapphic shit is in this book. \"Findlen also points out the odd way that some straight women reconcile themselves with this threat: by arguing that feminists aren't all dykes. (Which implies, among other ignorant assumptions, that all gay women are inherently feminist.)\" ??? No, definitely not the immediate implication- that being a lesbian or a woman that loves other women is something Awful and something Not to Be Associated With. No one's going to think that all gay women are inherently feminist- that makes 0 sense. They call Native Americans \"American Indians\", and (even though they're quoting a Native American woman, they still definitely shouldn't have said this) use \"the 'red roots of white feminism'\". On the same page, they refer to black people as \"blacks\" (\"Acknowledging that the forces working against both women and blacks were white men [...]\"). Oh, they also blame all black people of the time for creating the Black Power, because it wasn't the previous \"more egalitarian and racially integrated civil-rights movement, which meant not only that whites were kicked out but that, generally speaking, black women were demoted from being organizers to simply being 'nation-builders' (mothers)\". First off, the fact that they're mad at black people for starting to spearhead a movement intended for them. Secondly... What rights do they have to say that black women became breeders- if they'd done any of their research, they'd know how heavily steeped in white-supremacy and how racist that sentiment is.There's also the discussion of \"Girlie\" culture, which I have honestly never heard of, but it really just sounds like a bunch of women enjoying traditionally feminine things, but are being infantilized for it. \"Girlies have reclaimed girl culture, which is made up of such formerly disparaged girl things as knitting, the color pink, nail polish, and fun.\" Yeah... just normal things women can do as hobbies, though. Oh, remember how I brought up them devaluing women's work? What really pissed me off is how they champion the idea that we need to Get Out There and Make A Difference, they denounce women with liberal arts degrees, and essentially say it's their fault that there are male-dominated fields. (\"While our own liberal-arts educations appear to have furthered us in our own professions and were even the sites of our feminist awakenings, we think that women should be pioneering the tech world along with men, not simply going after those liberal-arts degrees.\") Cute sentiment, but as a girl in the STEM field, I can say that there are way more factors contributing to the lack of women in these fields (how about the fact that I'm put to a higher standard because I'm a woman, and, when I fail, I somehow represent my whole gender?).Again, haven't read the whole thing (I feel like I got a pretty good taste of it, though!) but, to sum it up: two white women act as if they're the lynchpin to the entire Third Wave Feminist movement, all while degrading women of color and queer people."}, {"userName": "Rachel Hock", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71201452-rachel-hock", "userReview": "This was kind of my own personal Feminism 101 textbook.

I myself identify as bisexual and have come under a lot of fire from the LGBT community as well as the straight community. It's very hard to have people take bisexual people seriously because everyone assumes you're stuck in the middle of sexuality and trying to pick a side. It's not like that at all, and the fact that this book had to go and talk about the sexuality like that, like there really is a sexual binary was pretty disappointing. As the book went on I enjoyed aspects, but that comment really annoyed me. In more context; they were talking about A Woman Needs a Man phrase and how some women turn to bisexuality when they no longer want to deal with men. I'm really disheartened to pick up a book on feminism, and continue to see my sexuality being under fire because people don't understand it.

There's a science book, one of the Song of Ice and Fire series, another etiquette book, and one on goddesses (seriously). And then there\u2019s this one, which I started way back in January. Why the ten month break between starting and finishing it? Well \u2026 I just did not like it. Manifesta is on a lot of 'must read' feminism book lists, but I found it to be mediocre. The writing isn't bad - it's not like Cinderella's Lost Diary or whatever that unfortunate book was that Cannonballers were offered for free earlier this year. My problem is that it\u2019s not actually what it claims to be - a feminism manifesto. It's more like a thrown-together anthology of white feminism, with some 'picture this' writing thrown in. The chapters feel disjointed, and I'm not entirely clear what the authors sought to do with this book. Were they trying to say what the 'third wave' feminists are contributing to feminism as a whole? Were they trying to explore what previous feminists did (and how that was and was not successful)? Trying to outline what we should be doing going forward? I think a book could be successful in doing all three, but that\u2019s not this book.In addition to the book feeling disjointed and unfocused, there were so many areas where they missed opportunities to really explore feminism - warts and all. There was even one point where I wanted to just throw the book out the window, but was nearly 200 pages in so I just stuck it out. That moment was during a discussion of toys for young girls, and the issues with Barbie, and the attempts to push Mattel to sell Barbies that look more like all girls \u2013 so not just blond, white Barbies. The authors passed that off as \u201cPC,\u201d and they meant that as an insult. Any book that uses the concept of \"Politically Correct\" as though it is derogatory just isn't a good book in my opinion. Saying something is 'politically correct' means that it's showing some empathy to people, and recognizing that straight, white, cis people aren't all who matter. That very specific issue is one example of the larger problem with this book - it's so, very, very white. Yes, the authors mention contributions from women of color (usually in passing), but they don't acknowledge any of the larger issues with mainstream white feminism. They buy into the \"women fought to join the workforce and stay there after the war\" story, for example, but don't acknowledge that many women of color had already been working for decades. They don't recognize the complexity of race, gender and sexuality - it's a lot of Gloria Steinem and one reference to bell hooks.Going forward, I'll be avoiding these generic overviews of feminism, whether targeting and young women or not. I'm more interested in learning about the full history of feminism, and womanism, and reading books that look at the bigger issues of intersectionality that mainstream feminism keeps ignoring."}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643578-jess", "userReview": "This was a long read with some dry parts here and there, but it is definitely a feminist text that is very much for the younger generation. This could even be seen as THE feminist text for Third Wave women, but I certainly cannot be the judge of that.I've read a lot of feminist literature, one of my favorites being Steinam's \"Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions\". It spoke about not only women's issues but issues of race and sexuality as well. But it still had a dated and slightly stodgy feel to it at times, and I knew I was reading true words that rang much louder at the time they were actually written. \"Manifesta\" is more radical, edgier, harsher, bolder, and truer than other texts I have read.I lot of ideas I felt so isolated in were examined in this book, such as \"girlie\" culture and the need for little girls to express their femininity rather than mask it in masculinity. I also loved the section of the book that covered the differences between older feminists and newer feminists (second and third wavers) while bridging those awkward and tense gaps.The only problem is that this book is already dated! Argh! I'm sure Baumgarder and Richards are wishing they could write a \"Manifesta pt. 2\" that tracks the rise of internet activism and the \"fourth wave\" of online feminists. This was a great book, but I still felt about ten years too young to understand so much of it. We need to have a feminist text that covers the internet boom.The beginning of the book may be off-putting to some, especially the \"dinner party\" section, which did not read as women getting together and chatting while bonding over food. It actually came off as a catty group of women trying to out-do each others outrageous stories. That isn't my brand of feminism- to be a feminist, you don't need to be sexual/a virgin/a slut/a prude/a wild child/ a home body/a lesbian/a mother/a wife, and some of the writing in the beginning came of as judgmental.The end actually brought tears to my eyes. That was a helluva epilogue. The saddest part is, we are so, so far away from that utopia. Twelve years later and we have made so little progress.(Also a special book because it is the first I borrowed from my college's Women's Center- so many great books waiting to be read here!)"}, {"userName": "lisa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76573-lisa", "userReview": "Don't bother. Hopelessly trapped in the early oughts. This book is irrelevant in spite of very pronounced efforts on the part of the authors to make it a seminal text (ICYMI: I made a feminist pun with semen!)."}, {"userName": "Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5701760-taylor", "userReview": "I think this book is a good reference for third wave/young feminists who want to become more familiar with the American movement and the various women who have been involved with feminism since it\u2019s inception (most emphasis being on third wavers.) The tone is very conversational which makes it approachable, even if, like a conversation, sometimes it falls off track and you end up in a place you weren\u2019t expecting. Manifesta talks about the women of the movement (dropping lots of names of both people and organizations throughout second and third wave feminism), anecdotes and factoids, references to other books, opinions on those books/authors, and covers a number of different topics from teen magazines to rape. Baumgardner and Richards discuss feminism in the media, \u201cGirlies\u201d \u2013 the young women and girls of feminism, the gap between second and third wave feminists, the women within the movement that like to stir up the rest of the feminists, activism and more. While at times the writing style could be a bit ADD, overall I thought there were plenty of nuggets of information in the text that were worthwhile. The section on teen magazines really took me back\u2026 remember Seventeen\u2019s column Trauma-rama??? I had forgotten all about how much I liked it when I was 12 or 13 and got my first subscription. Also useful are the various appendices which include contact information for a number of offices and organizations, as well as a timeline of feminist events beginning at A.D. 33 (The Last Supper). With every feminist book I read I take away a little bit more knowledge about the movement and what it stands for, and this book contributed a handful of new issues to the pile. It really only spoke exclusively about feminism in the USA/white women\u2019s feminism, however; women of colour were barely touched upon at all. This book was a good reference for reading about the movement in America, but not the rest of the world. Regardless, I give it a thumbs up."}, {"userName": "melissa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67621-melissa", "userReview": "This book helped me understand the differences between me, as a 20/30-something year old woman working in glossy magazines while having grown up my entire life as a feminist -- and the generations before me, who had to be a different kind of feminist and who may not always understand how my generation thinks.I feel like they did a great job of bridging that gap and showing an absolutely necessary respect for, and understanding of, all the work that has gone into getting us to this place -- but also showing that it's ok for us now to make choices of our own. That wearing lipstick or heels doesn't make you a bad feminist, as long as you're making informed choices.It's definitely written for a specific audience -- young women who've grown up in a world where it was assumed that we could do anything we wanted and we're now casting about to figure out what \"anything you want\" really means to us...while our mothers and grandmothers watch us thinking \"we worked so hard to earn you this freedom, why are you just wasting it? Go do something amazing already!\"Not long after I'd finished this book, I was at a shoe store with my mother, trying on heels. An older woman stopped and actually tsk-ed me, saying \"I marched so you wouldn't have to wear those shoes\" and I felt able to say \"And I truly appreciate that. But you marched so that we'd have the CHOICE to wear these or not. And I know that I have a choice\" Which is true, no one thinks any less of me for not wearing heels and as long as no one thinks less of me for choosing to wear them sometimes, then maybe we've accomplished what we wanted -- respect for our choices, no matter what they are."}], "description": "A powerful indictment from within of the current state of feminism, and a passionate call to armsFrom Lilith Fair to Buffy the Vampire Slayer to the WNBA--everywhere you look, girl culture is clearly ascendant. Young women live by feminism's goals, yet feminism itself is undeniably at a crossroads; \"girl power\" feminists appear to be obsessed with personal empowerment at the expense of politics while political institutions such as Ms. and NOW are so battle weary they've lost their ability to speak to a new generation. In Manifesta, Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards show the snags in each feminist hub--from the dissolution of riot grrrls into the likes of the Spice Girls, to older women's hawking of young girls' imperiled self-esteem, to the hyped hatred of feminist thorns like Katie Roiphe and Naomi Wolf--and prove that these snags have not, in fact, torn feminism asunder. In an intelligent and incendiary argument, Baumgardner and Richards address issues instead of feelings and the political as well as the personal. They describe the seven deadly sins the media commits against feminism, provide keys to accessible and urgent activism, discuss why the ERA is still a relevant and crucial political goal, and spell out what a world with equality would look like. They apply Third Wave confidence to Second Wave consciousness, all the while maintaining that the answer to feminism's problems is still feminism.", "title": "Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism, and the Future", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98521.Manifesta", "average": 3.71, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1311983118l/98521.jpg", "reviews": 131, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/56655.Jennifer_Baumgardner", "name": "Jennifer Baumgardner"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/56656.Amy_Richards", "name": "Amy Richards"}], "type": ["Feminism", "Nonfiction", "Gender", "Politics", "Gender"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98521.Manifesta", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7326948-manifesta", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98522.Grassroots", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98520.Look_Both_Ways", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4019714-abortion-life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10642309-f-em", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98532.The_Female_Eunuch"]}
