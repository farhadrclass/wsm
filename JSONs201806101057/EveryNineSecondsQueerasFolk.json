Hope they are just updating something *worrys*Anyway, I picked up a few of the books based on the Showtime series Queer as Folk. Had them sitting on my bookshelf for a bit and, after picking up season 1 a little bit ago, the boys from the show started calling my name and I've missed them (I'm not crazy, really!). This book tells of Brian and Michael as they are into their last year of high school and graduation with college on the horizon. I wasn't really expecting much out of this book, and I was plesantly surprised. Tons of laugh out loud moments (startled a coworker yesterday, then I had to try to explain what I was reading--oops). This loses a star from me for the sex, strangely enough. Too many cringe-worthy metaphores, like 'cupping the round globes of his ass'. I think fanfiction as spoiled me for well-written smut. Oh, and I could totally tell that the book was written by a guy, from some of the descriptions.I really want to read the next book, which I think takes place right after this one--or a few months after, but I have a library book that I need to read. Or attempt to read. I feel like being picky with it so I can return it and dive into the next book!**Popping by to add that I love Brian and Michael's relationship or lack there of and really wish it would have gone differently on the show...but then I think of Justin and Ben and how much I really liked them lol."}, {"userName": "Michele Brack", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27341143-michele-brack", "userReview": "#22 A book with an LGBTQ+ protagonistThey just rolled a whole bunch of stuff from the show in here, didn't they? 4 year-old Justin in the liquor store?

Non solo ho trovato Brian profondamente OOC, ma il libro di per s\u00e9 era semplicemente ridicolo (esempio: la scena del picnic studentesco in cui giocano al gioco della bottiglia). Non pensavo che avrei mai potuto disprezzare qualcosa legato a qaf ma in questo caso sembra proprio che io mi debba ricredere. Avrei voluto qualche scena in cui ci si soffermava sul rapporto di Brian e di Gary/Mr.Palmer/il coach, ma niente. Non mi \u00e8 sembrato che volessero mantenere una apparenza di mistero, penso invece che non abbiamo pensato davvero al rapporto e che abbiamo scritto e pubblicato questo libro solo per far entrare pi\u00f9 soldi, non impegnandosi neanche. Per tutto il libro abbiamo ridicole scene Brian/Michael in cui effettivamente non succede niente. Dopodich\u00e9 vediamo i Kinney ma anche qui non succede niente. L'unico punto di questo libro sembra essere Andy aka un personaggio che abbiamo inventato per far vedere che anche Michael pu\u00f2 piacere ma che faremo finire lo stesso a letto con Brian perch\u00e9 non sa tenerselo nei pantaloni. Spero che gli altri due migliorino, qui decisamente manca qualcosa.

The book was well written and stayed with the characters story-lines very well for the most part. In one chapter it had me slightly shocked, as I hope it will for anyone else who has watched the Queer as Folk US series. I do however find it a tad odd that a lot of the story-lines were predictable, you knew how they were going to play out long before they actually happened; this did weaken the book as I would have liked something a little more surprising.The book did help to fill in the blanks of the Kinney household, though I found the portrayal of Claire quite odd and did not match the series.Overall the book is worthy of reading, but don't expect it to be breathtaking."}, {"userName": "Marie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1529919-marie", "userReview": "I thought this was a nice thing to read when you've seen the whole QAF series. The idea was good, a sort of prequel to the real thing but dear god, I'm still laughing at the sex scenes. I totally lost it over the \"hardening joystick\" and it didn't get any better after that. All in all, the whole thing wasn't worth the time or money, some facts are wrong as well and the chance meeting of little Justin and Brian at the liquor store was just plain out stupid. So. I'd say read it just for the laugh and then go back to watching the TV show."}, {"userName": "Kellyanne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2612723-kellyanne", "userReview": "people try and try to compare this book to the series, and there really is no comparison. as with any movie or tv show that is made into a book, you really have to take each as they are.

Fans of the show may be put off by some of the continuity errors, but considering this was written two years before the show ended, I think most of the mistakes are forgiveable. The author gets the complicated relationship between Brian and Michael right, while hilariously getting characteristics about each wrong.
