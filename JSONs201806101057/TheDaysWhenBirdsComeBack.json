It is a fitting title for this bittersweet tale of two people scarred by loss, whose chance meeting prompts them to reflect on the past and initiate the first steps towards healing. Both Jameson and June are beautifully drawn, each carrying a deep sorrow in their hearts that has shaped their lives and made them isolate themselves in their little bubbles of grief, guilt and regret. Thrown together in the picturesque setting of June\u2019s childhood home, a little cottage in rural Oregon, they forge a fragile connection that allows them to slowly confide in each other and find solace in each other as they try to come to terms with the past.Reed\u2019s writing is beautiful and wistful, creating true-to-life characters and an atmospheric setting that is almost a character in itself, as it plays such an important part in the story. I loved being taken on a journey of discovery of the events that have made June and Jameson the people they have become, and to witness their slow emergence from the quagmire of grief as the seasons change. This is a slow, character driven and reflective story. Anyone who is not a stranger to loss and grief will find elements of June and Jameson\u2019s story resonating with their own lives. An exquisite and beautifully crafted novel that touched me deeply.Thank you to Netgalley and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for the free electronic copy of this novel and for giving me the opportunity to provide an honest review. *blog*  *facebook*  *instagram*"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3285729-amy", "userReview": "4.5gorgeous melancholy tragedy leads to connection, understanding, support, belonging"}, {"userName": "Mary Holstein", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39580458-mary-holstein", "userReview": "This is a beautifully written book\u2014exquisite in its sense of place and understanding of the flaws in human nature.

Told in chapters that alternate between the two main characters, the book shifts between two intertwined stories of loss. June is reeling after her recent break-up and return home, where she is overcome by childhood memories she\u2019s kept at bay for decades. She hires Jameson to renovate her grandparents\u2019 home, and his own grief is renewed by returning to the small coastal town where his own life fell apart. The book unfolds gracefully, concluding in the spirit of Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s assertion that all endings should be both surprising and inevitable. Deborah Reed is a master at writing believable dialogue, including only meaningful details, and slowly pulling the layers of misery away to expose the human soul within. Here, she brings to life the Oregon coast and two characters who might not have much to live for, save the house that brings them together."}, {"userName": "Holly Lorincz", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33129515-holly-lorincz", "userReview": "Do yourself a favor, put this on the top of the stack next to your bed.

Sometimes, a book comes to us at the perfect moment, striking chords that resonate with our most pressing hopes and fear. This aspect of our shared existence isn\u2019t lost on author Deborah Reed, whose spellbinding novel shows the ways in which life can be an unreadable map, fate and free will forming confused, webbed paths, often leading us to question whether it\u2019s merely an exercise of survival. The Days When Birds Came Back is the story of two protagonists\u2014June Byrne and Jamison Winters\u2014whose lives have stagnated due to grief and guilt. June has survived childhood trauma and divorce and Jamison has lost his children; each wonders what part he/she played in their separate tragedies. The narrative takes place where these two lives intersect, on the Oregon coast where June has hired Jamison to renovate her grandparents\u2019 bungalow.There\u2019s so much to say about this immersive, evocative, and multi-layered novel and the way it wraps its arms around you. The pain that defines both characters is palpable, as vivid as the colorful, pulsing setting: the time- and weather-worn homes that hold memories and secrets, the encompassing, unremitting nature outside. This setting steeps both characters in an earlier time and the source of their suffering, forcing them to examine long-buried feelings. I can\u2019t recall a recent time when I anticipated the meeting of two characters as much as I hoped for communion and understanding between June and Jamison. The novel unfolds slowly and has a sort of lulling, meditative quality. There was a constant pull between wanting to savor Reed\u2019s beautiful prose and countless wisdoms, and wanting to press ahead and follow the clues. She shines a warm light on the profoundness of everyday existence, what the late writer Kent Haruf called \u201cthe precious ordinary.\u201d As we follow these characters getting through their days as we all do, we learn more about what they\u2019ve lived through as we experience their coming together at the perfect time, in the perfect place. It seems a sort of miracle, like life itself.So yes, it\u2019s a story about grief and its tentacles, but it\u2019s also about the possibility of being seen and heard in life, and this glimmer of hope blinks from start to finish. All great novels require us to look around and to look within. For me, The Days When Birds Came Back was the right book at the right time, one I\u2019ll appreciate and contemplate for a long time to come."}, {"userName": "Tabitha Blankenbiller", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4319442-tabitha-blankenbiller", "userReview": "What happens after everything has happened? This is where Deborah Reed introduces us to June and Jameson, characters who both have a deep, painful connection with the Oregon Coast. They must both, by necessity of survival, push through their individual grief in separate losses that serendipitous bring them together. Reed writes with loving care that brings nature and heartache to life, with an unforgettable eye for detail. THE DAYS WHEN BIRDS COME BACK is a full-hearted, visceral journey that reads as both a homage to the craggy majesty of the Pacific Northwest coast and a mystery of the heart between people who are re-learning how to connect to the world and relationships around them.

Two of my favorite things about her work are in evidence here: beautiful language (rich, elegant, musical) and a window into the characters' consciousness and emotions that feels so specific and idiosyncratic and yet uncannily universal. I teach memoir and some of my students were trying to figure out how to give readers an insight into their characters' emotional life in fresh and original ways. Wwhen I looked for an example they could follow, I found the excerpt I'll quote below, from The Days When Birds Come Back. Hear how it sings. Feel how moving it is. Every paragraph in the book is this good.\"June shut out the nighttime shrieks and sobs of the other girls by creating a list of seven comforts that she hid inside herself like sweets she could reach for when no one was looking. All these years later those seven comforts still held up. June could turn to them, even as they embarrassed her, even as she felt eccentric in the privacy of her own mind. Ian was the only living soul she\u2019d ever told about these things, and how good was he, becoming even more enamored with her? Hot sun on her skin was number three. The scent of horse sweat was number five, especially when tracing the air after a good pat of wool mitten against its neck on a chilly afternoon.\""}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3452732-andrew", "userReview": "In this beautiful novel by Deborah Reed (whose books Carry Yourself Back to Me, Things We Set on Fire, and Olivay are also worth your time), June, an alcoholic fresh on the wagon, analyzes her life with a clear head for maybe the first time in years. Through memories of her philandering father\u2019s suicide, her recently divorced ex-husband, and her troubled youth, we learn a good deal about her and why she loves a pair of bungalows on the Oregon coast. Juxtaposed to June is Jameson, a contractor who, having lost two children in a grocery-store shootout, has grief of his own. These two characters come together in a landscape that means different things at different times to each of them. The fictional town of Nestucca Beach is both a refuge and the place where their lives changed forever. This highly literary story explores the shifting weight coincidence can play in the healing process and how nostalgia can be both a blessing and a curse. June and Jameson wrestle with their memories of love and loss, finding solace in restoring a home. Reed fills these pages with foxglove, euphorbia, and birch, and the textures of the coast come alive is this melancholy novel. Highly recommended for fans of coastal Oregon."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7134495-ellen", "userReview": "All I can say is Wow!

An overwhelming emotion which keeps cluttering the mind with questions such as \"what should I say\", \"should I do this\", \"will I see them today\", \"did I make a fool of myself\", etc. This unrequited obsession goes on and on, even if the other person is oblivious to the emotions they provoke, even if the words are never spoken or feelings ever revealed. Yet, there is a palpable connection which the reader can feel without any graphic sexual content. It's the unspoken romance which keeps us engaged.That's how it is between June and Jameson in The Days When Birds Come Back by Deborah Reed, two lost souls whose past hurts have overwhelmed their lives, destroying relationships and making day to day interactions almost intolerable. Two souls caught up in the solace found in nature who are finally able to reveal their innermost traumas to each other without fear of judgement, because of a basic understanding of having been there in one form or another. A romance of a simple touch or smile, or even a post card - but it's enough. June who formerly found relief at the bottom of a bottle turns to her \"seven comforts, none of which were a drink\". Finding herself back home in rural Oregon by the coast where it all started, she needs someone to renovate her grandparents next door cottage so she can sell it. Enter Jameson (same as the whiskey) who is also returning to the \"scene of the crime\", but he finds peace in this home where he now lives while he works, appreciating the ambience of the surrounding wildlife. June, just an eyesight away, keeps her distance, yet there is a nonverbal communication even before they find their commonality. In spite of their new found affinity, Jameson has a wife, Sarah Anne, waiting for him seven hours away back home with their new foster son. June's ex is in Australia, sent away while she was in a drunken rage. And so the summer goes, from June to September as the house takes shape and it's time to move on. Told through introspections interspersed with dialogue we discover the secrets haunting the two thirty five year olds who have somehow found a way to share the formerly closeted details of their damaged lives. There's no telling here, just a gentle leaning towards the truth. Not for those who like a narrative to explain what's happening, in this one the reader must glean the facts and come to their own conclusions.

I've tried for weeks to finish this book and I just can't do it. Based on the synopsis, I really thought I would connect with June. She is recently divorced and haunted by memories of childhood and the death of her father. I expected an emotionally complex character but I didn't connect with June at all. The story is told from alternating points of view. Jameson is the other main character. He too has suffered tremendous loss and seemingly intense emotional pain but I didn't feel it. I kept waiting, assuming that when June and Jameson\u2019s paths finally crossed it would all come together for me but it didn't. I didn't feel any real emotional connection between June and Jameson and at some point I stopped caring how the story would end. This book was narrated by Xe Sands.

As to the restoration of the old house, it too is a symbol of the changes that these characters must make in order to deal with past tragedies. These tragedies were emotionally affecting as I read. Their stories are revealed a bit at a time, which keeps the novel moving until resolution results. Deborah Reed's prose is creative with clear descriptions that bring the characters to life. I really wanted to know how it all would end, and it was satisfying on several levels (I will avoid spoilers).

While this type of secret-keeping usually frustrates me, in this book, the author has masterfully presented it in a way that makes perfect sense.
