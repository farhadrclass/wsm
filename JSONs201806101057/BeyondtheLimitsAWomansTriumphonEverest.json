That said, i'm always interested in adventure books (esp hiking/climbing). Even better when it's told from a woman's perspective. Stacy Allison is an articulate author who writes well. Great insight and understanding. Women are strong, intelligent, superior individuals; it's time we recognized ourselves as such and PROPEL EACH OTHER THE F*CK FORWARD. :) (Excuse my language). Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Susan Liston", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/630381-susan-liston", "userReview": "This was quick and interesting. The author and I are close to the same age, but that is the ONLY thing I could possibly find in common with her This started with her story of how, at a family gathering at age seven, she shoved aside the boys trying to climb up the inside of a large, dead tree, and did it herself,climbed out a hole onto a branch, got stuck and had to be rescued by her father. I, on the other hand, would go hunt ladybugs if my silly friends insisted on playing on the monkey bars, which I would never go NEAR. A person could FALL. I guess this helps explain my fascination with people who climb things, because my idea of bravery is the other day when I LEANED OUT A LITTLE WAYS OVER the second floor railing of my apartment to see if the mailperson had finished. Whew. Survived it. She spends a bit of time on her failed marriage to an abusive control freak, this surprised me that such a physically strong and seemingly fearless person would have been so dominated by this creep, but I guess 30 years ago information and support would have been considerably harder to come by. And it does happen. The detailed harrowing accounts of her various big climbs, including the two trips to Everest, are fascinating, as I shake my head in bewilderment that anyone would do this. Aren't hobbies supposed to be FUN?"}, {"userName": "Sally Edsall", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59775414-sally-edsall", "userReview": "A minority of mountaineering books are written by or about women (understandable, they comprising a minority of mountaineers).This is well worth reading, though unlikely to appeal to those not already interested practioners - armchair or otherwise - of scaling great heights in incredibly uncomfortable conditions.One aspect I was really interested in was Allison's no-holds barred depiction of some of the peccadilloes of those she is/was closest to. I think of Scott Fischer - the gungho boys-own daredevil with whom she had an unsuccessful attempt on Everest and with whom she worked. It provides rather an interesting insight into the character of someone who died in the infamous 1996 storms on Everest so vividly depicted in many books, most notably, Jon Krakeur's Into Thin Air.Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but from Allison's portrayal, it's almost a case of \"No wonder!\""}, {"userName": "Mazola1", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/825885-mazola1", "userReview": "In Beyond The Limits, Stacy Allison tells what it took to become the first American woman to summit Mount Everest. That would be a lot of hard work, innate climbing ability, a strong spirit, the drive to persist in the face of obstacles, and a bit of luck. Allison tells how she overcame difficulties in her climbing and professional life to stand in triumph at the top of the world's highest mountain.I couldn't help but compare Stacy Allison's story with that of Alison Hargreaves, the British climber who also climbed Mount Everest and was later killed descending K2. If only Hargreaves had been able to break free of an abusive husband, as Allison did, perhaps her story would have had a happier high point."}, {"userName": "Sylvie O'rourke", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16853387-sylvie-o-rourke", "userReview": "This is quite a suspenseful tale of risk taking and guts. It is the story of the first American Woman to summit Everest. I don't understand the drive that people have to endanger their lives in this way and I don't accept the explanation of some that they climb dangerous mountains simply 'because they're there.\" Stacy explains it this way: \"You find your talent, and see how far it will take you. You do what makes you feel the most alive.\" It makes me very glad happy that I need much less than that to feel alive. Good read and hard to put down. You just want to keep going to see what happens next."}, {"userName": "Erika", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/803748-erika", "userReview": "This book was part mountain adventure story and part memoir. I like memoirs, so I was fine with the extra padding in the beginning of the book - the explanation of why the author climbs mountains and the back-story behind her successful climb of Everest. She clearly has a lot of strength, stamina, and amazing determination. She described the politics of the expedition party objectively, without judging or coloring the facts with her own opinions."}, {"userName": "Hillery", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/561884-hillery", "userReview": "This is the story of Stacy Allison, the first American woman to summit Mount Everest.

It was interesting to read about climbing but that's about it. Her personal story just didn't captivate me like the descriptions of the mountains did. Maybe because I am not into extreme sports?

Interesting memoire.of the first american women to climb Mt Everest in 1988."}], "description": "The true story of how America's premier female mountain climber harnessed her inner strength to conquer not only Mt. Everest, but her own personal crisis.For every three climbers who attempt to reach the elusive summit of Mt. Everest, one dies trying. But in 1988 Stacy Allison became the first American woman ever to climb the world's highest peak, having triumphed over not just the mountain\u0097a treacherous and overwhelmingly male domain\u0097but over a devastating home life filled with domestic abuse. With each step, she got closer not just to the summit, but to throwing off the ropes that held her in a marriage dangerous to both her physical and mental well-being.Allison's thrilling account of how she called upon the same strength and courage that took her to the top of the world to finally leave her abusive husband is a dramatic testimony to her never-say-die spirit. The power of her vision, and her quest to achieve her dreams and free herself from a life of despair, are an inspiration of the highest kind.\"Men climb mountains because they're there.' Allison...did it to see if she could measure up. And as she scales peak after peak...her self esteem soars. Braving the Himalayan death zone, the most violent blizzard in forty years, avalanches, white-outs, and being lost at 26,000 feet, Allison...conquers her own life as she conquers Everest.\"\u0097Jan Goodwin, author of Caught in the Crossfire", "title": "Beyond the Limits: A Woman's Triumph on Everest", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1196582.Beyond_the_Limits", "average": 3.6, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1181797097l/1196582.jpg", "reviews": 13, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/532008.Stacy_Allison", "name": "Stacy Allison"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/532007.Peter_Carlin", "name": "Peter Carlin"}], "type": ["Adventure", "Biography", "Nonfiction", "Travel"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1196582.Beyond_the_Limits", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1196583.Many_Mountains_to_Climb"]}
