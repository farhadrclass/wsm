It was riddled with tedious lists of characters activities. Pastor Zeke walked here, ate here, talked to this person, said a prayer for that person. Far too much telling for my taste. I wanted to just skim over these endless lists (almost every character had them) to get to the meet of the story.Rivers did a nice job in making Abra a sympathetic character, even with all of her bad decisions. But from a Christian novel stand point, I almost found her too sympathetic. For all of the bad choices she made, it was easy for the reader to excuse the behavior because of her past. And that's okay, it was good to understand where she was coming from, why she would get taken in by the kind of men she did, but it also made her 'redemption' expected, even deserving. How different this story would be if she had come from a traditional, loving background and made those same decisions.And although Pastor Zeke and Joshua talked about themselves as having flaws, it was hard to find them. These men were too perfect. Too patient. Too trusting. Too giving. Too self-sacrificing. I think I would have liked to see Joshua's PTSD a more pronounced. It was too easily solved with having one person who had similar experiences to talk to.And as for the surprise plot twist?? Saw that one coming from the moment the character stepped into the story. It was simply a matter of waiting for the big reveal. Once it came (far too late in the book with little fanfare) it was resolved too easily, then explained away by simply saying that a sign of a Christian life is forgiveness. (another moment of telling rather than showing)And this is the first time I have seen a Christian writer try to write a sex scene in a romantic but clean way. It was clean, but lacked any emotion. I found myself rolling my eyes. The entire seen was unnecessary. And quite honestly, unbelievable considering other events in the book.I like Christian lit. I like reading about people who have strong belief in God and still struggle with the trials of life. I like when their faith is rewarded and they feel God's love and redemption. But I found the Christian element in this book for too heavy handed. Granted, Pastor Zeke, a main character, was a preacher. But it seemed that everyone except the villains (and they were painted with no redeeming qualities at all) spent every conversation proclaiming God's love.Overall, I expected more and was left wanting."}, {"userName": "Ane Mulligan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4469633-ane-mulligan", "userReview": "Francine Rivers is perhaps the best novelist of our time. Her ability to tell a story is extraordinary. In Bridge to Haven, she quickly captured me with her characters and pulled me into the story of this prodigal daughter. It's a story you can't forget. I predict it will become a blockbuster like Redeeming Love. Novel Rocket and I give it our highest recommendation. It's a 5-star must read.

I have just finished an incredible book. -Riveting, heart-wrenching, breathtaking, glorious book. The amazingness of God and the power of prayer are so freely and deeply shown. The dear characters, so real and relatable. The tragedgies, the hurt, the rebellion, the redemption... Abra is abandoned under a bridge as a newborn, and then given away by the man she knew to be her father. The hurt and anger follow her into her teen years, and she starts seeking love in the most dangerous of places. One thing leads to another, and soon she finds she's in a position she never thought she'd be... as a movie star. Her name is changed, bridges are burnt. She's been used, abused, heartbroken, tossed-out, and finally, controlled. She lives the \"glamorous\" life of a star; but inside, where the old Abra Matthew faintly lurks, she just longs to go home to Haven. But that's impossible, of course... I fell in love with these characters' stories: Abra, Pastor Zeke, Joshua, Susan, Mitzi, Penny, Peter, Priscilla, and all the others, They were so real. I felt their pain, loss, joy, fear... So sad to leave them, wish there was more to read!!Bridge to Haven really just touched my heart. Several times I almost cried with either pain or joy. The end of chapter 17 was a monumental turning point... yes, I almost cried there too; you'll see why! :) There was definitely more sensuality and details than I usually expect in Christian-fiction, yet it was not like some books where sordid acts are glorified even as they're portrayed as wrong. Francine Rivers didn't glorify sinful acts... she made them out for what they really are: ugly and damaging. There was nothing exciting or fun about the young man who convinced a sixteen-year-old hurting girl to run away with him. In the end, he had the most basest of insticts, lust and rage. -And it was heart-breaking and awful to see him use an innocent, albeit confused, girl in such an ugly way. My heart broke for the girl as I watched her struggle through the consequences. **Spoiler Alert!!** However, though there might have been more details than needed here too, I can only say that the marriage and brief wedding night sort-of scene between Joshua and Abra was stunningly beautiful. It was arranged by God, and as God intended. Broken things were mended. Shattered purity was made whole and clean. Yes, this was another part that almost brought me to tears. It just was SO amazing to see Abra restored... to realize that the relationship between a man and his wife as God intended it is a beautiful thing. But yeah, I think it could have been every bit as beautiful without that amount of \"sensual detail\" that it had. **Spoiler Alert** Yeah... I still think Christian authors need to be really careful about how much detail/sensuality they add to their novels. It's a fine line. We do not need to experience romance to that level between characters. We'll experience our own romance when the time is right!! I'd rather read books with strictly clean/sweet romances... but this story was rather different. Details seemed needed, though definitely not as much as were added. I don't know. I guess you can see what you think. But definitely this book is for a mature audience.  But overall, Francine Rivers knows how to write a redemptive story that just tugs at your heart. At the end, I think, \"God, You are awesome, glory be to Your name!\" So yes, heart-breaking, yet ultimately beautiful to watch this story unfold. A Bridge to Haven, unforgettable spiritual journey to hope, forgiveness, wholeness, and joy. Simply beautiful."}, {"userName": "Natalie Vellacott", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34178791-natalie-vellacott", "userReview": "I only made it a third of the way through this book. I stopped reading due to the sexual content--an extremely detailed bedroom scene which was effectively a rape as the victim had expressed that she didn't want to participate.I have read some great books by Rivers and others that I really didn't like recently. This was probably the worst in terms of the graphic detail and I don't understand really why she included it. She managed to do a great job in The Atonement Child, which also has a rape scene, of dealing with the matter sensitively whilst still telling the story and without the graphic detail. But unfortunately Bridge to Haven is a definite fail.I also was a little uncomfortable with an \"innocent\" romance developing between two of the main characters because although they were not biologically related, they had grown up in the same household and must've known each other as brother and sister from a young age. The scenes where the male party begins to experience lustful feelings towards the girl were a little weird given the original nature of their relationship. Also, the descriptions of them were again quite graphic.I can't comment on the Hollywood storyline as I didn't read that far but others reviews state that it involves strip clubs and the like. If that is the case, then judging by the graphic details that I have already endured, I'm glad I stopped reading when I did.I don't recommend this book due to the graphic sexual content.For those seeking a cleaner read by Francine Rivers (and to prove that I'm not just being deliberately controversial) try The Atonement Child [https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...] or And the Shofar Blew [https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...] or even The Last Sin Eater [https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...] but avoid Redeeming Love [https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...] The Scarlet Thread is mediocre [https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...].

I enjoyed it and sympathized with the Abra, the baby rescued by Pastor Zeke. Despite the love shown to Abra by Pastor Zeke, his wife Marianne, and others in the community, Abra finds herself unable to believe anyone really loves her. As a result she goes looking for love in all the wrong places. The author does a good job of making Abra sympathetic, despite the choices she makes and the hurt she brings to those who love her. Through the compromises and choices she ends up a movie star, with her name changed to Lena Scott. The novel recounts a lot of names of those she meets, including Elvis Presley and movie stars of the 1950s era like Susan Hayward, Elizabeth Taylor and many others. This is where I started to become less interested in the story. I\u2019m not a fan of reading of the Hollywood lifestyle. It made me sad to see the choices anyone makes to become a \u2018star\u2019 or even sometimes to survive in the movie industry. While I liked Pastor Zeke and his son Joshua and their unwavering love for Abra, it was almost like they were too perfect. They would have been more believable if we had seen their flaws. I enjoyed the book and it did involve emotions of anger and tears, I thought the change in Abra ended up being resolved a little too quickly. This is definitely written with the Christian market in mind and refers a lot to God, to prayer, bible verses and hymns, so I am not sure whether that would end up grating on those who did not believe so that they end up not reading the book. And that would be a shame as this is a story that clearly shows God\u2019s grace and forgiveness."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6116301-sarah", "userReview": "I struggled with how I wanted to rate this book. On one hand, it's Francine Rivers, the writer of my beloved Redeeming Love and Mark of the Lion series, and I must admit, Mrs Rivers is not afraid to go there! Life events that most Christian writers would skim over or not even attempt to write about, Francine takes us to those dark subjects to make the redemption even more powerful. On the other hand, I can't compare this to Redeeming Love. I had a really hard time connecting with any of the characters. I confess a few times, I wanted to stop and move on to other books on my TBR pile. Yet something kept me pulled in to see how this story would complete, and in true Rivers style- I may not have connected with the characters, but you can bet the last 100 pages had me reaching for the tissues. She still has the gift to hit those emotional places. Unfortunately, I don't see Bridge to Haven making my re-read every few years shelf, but was worth the new release read."}, {"userName": "Marnie  Kr\u00fcger", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6108495-marnie-kr-ger", "userReview": "You can make many plans, but the Lord\u2019s purpose will prevail.

I'm still so raw and fresh from reading it, I will probably edit this review a thousand times. But where so many of Francine Rivers books leave me thinking, processing, uplifted (though not always), this one did not. Instead, I just feel blank. Void, maybe? Let me try to break down what went wrong.As always, Rivers' characters are so deep. what they lack in passion or dialogue is made up in 'real'. I not only empathize with Abra Matthews, I know that if I were put in her shoes, I would think and feel as she does. Not to say that I relate to Abra, because I don't. But Rivers' writes in such a FULL way (rich might be the word? moving? deep?). I feel enveloped by the character. Not that I lose myself but just so that I know her in ways you don't even get to know your best friend. And I've moved into creepster territory, but Im just trying to communicate why I love her books. The reason this one fell short is not because I wasn't drawn in, but because I was unconvinced. Now don't get me wrong. I believed her guilt and her aversion to never facing home. To never facing those she loved with her shame. What I don't understand is her redemption- which, is key. With Christ, our guilt is only part of the story. And I NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND HER REDEMPTION. It felt too easy. Too wash away. Too rainbow. Her scars were deep and her shame was monstrous. I know because I felt it- because I was made to understand her need for a saviour. And I did. I did so deeply. But when the prodigal returned home, she was embraced. Which is to be expected- no complaints there. I was pleased and happy with the love of Christ shown by those who follow him and I believe that he is faithful to forgive our sins. But I have finally put my finger on what this story lacked. Abra never struggled to forgive herself. It is like it was enough for her to know she was loved by others and by Christ. For someone who became real in her guilt and baggage, she barely even struggled to uproot her shame- something that had taken over and kept her from home in the first place. And in Christ there is freedom (AMEN!) but there is also no insta-remedy for the consequences of sin. Christians do not have it rainbows and butterflies. And a lot of times that is because we won't allow God to give us everything he wants. But for someone who walked to road Abra did, who walked tight-fisted for years and was young when she walked into heartache- she should have struggled thought it. I needed her to struggle through it so that I could have answers too. So that I can learn to forgive myself. Because like I said, Rivers pulls you in. And I have not recovered from the shame and pain that I experienced for the first 400 pages. While I believe Christ is Almighty and Good and capable of forgiving the worst, I am much less convinced I can do that for myself. So while I come out of the world of Abra, I still cannot let go of the darkness she pulled me into. But only the best writing could create such darkness."}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11909124-staci", "userReview": "Lots of emotion through reading Bridge to Haven. At times, I was completely engaged and at other times found the detail about Abra's fall difficult to read.Ultimately, as with other Francine River novels, I found Abra's story to be full of God's love for us despite the mistakes we make. Abra felt unloved and chased after what she thought would bring fulfillment.I completely adored Joshua and Mitzi.

Bridge to Haven is riveting reading--just as riveting as Redeeming Love and Leota's Garden my two favorite Francine Rivers' novels thusfar.It's very easy to see why Francine has become a New York Times best-selling author. Her heroine Abra is orphaned and left under a bridge. Fortunately God leads Pastor Zeke to the spot where he quickly tucks Abra close to his heart where she stays the rest of her life.But no life can be lived without pain and loss. Abra is no exception. Some parts of Bridge to Haven were hard for me to read, kind of like in my own childhood when I watched my brother do things, I knew were going to get him into all kinds of trouble.

Consider yourself warned.Bridge To Haven was a sweeping novel, the story of Abra Matthews, who was left under a bridge as an infant and found by a pastor. Rivers knows how to keep you turning the pages, and overall, I enjoyed the actual reading of this novel. I felt like I became friends with the characters. In the end, it ends up being a story of redemption when Abra finally gives her life over to the Lord.Still, I struggle to give it a better rating for the following reasons.I forget how Rivers tends to take her main characters and rip their lives completely apart before they start to put things back together. That's what happened with Abra. She gets involved with a bad guy, and runs away with him, even though she knows he's only after her physically. He ends up practically using her as a semi-willing sex slave. This was hard for me to read, not just because it was a disturbing storyline, but also because I found it hard to believe in a way. Abra seemed over-the-top naive. I know that in real life some girls do go after guys who treat them like dirt, but I found this whole storyline hard to relate to.After some more ripping apart of Abra's life, she finally loses everything and goes back home to Haven with Joshua. Joshua was another complaint for me. I think Rivers was trying to make him somehow representative of Jesus (based on the name and a couple symbolic things in the story), but Joshua was over-the-top perfect in this story. To me, no human written character should be portrayed as perfect. Only one man lived a perfect life, and that WAS Jesus. In the afterword Rivers even says something about how Joshua wasn't perfect, and I was thinking...how exactly was he not? He seriously didn't do one thing wrong in the entire story. I dislike stories where one character is a complete train wreck, and the other is completely perfect, and ladies...let's just all realize that this guy was totally a figment of River's imagination. There isn't a man who ever lived who treats his romantic love as perfectly as Josh treats Abra in this book. I think there is some danger in reading books where the male romantic interest has zero flaws.Finally, Joshua and Abra eventually get married, and as I feared would happen, Rivers goes into detail about their wedding night. Not completely explicit detail, but explicit enough to make me frantically flip the pages with my cheeks burning. And I'm a married women. I think it's worth noting that I would NEVER let my teenage daughter read this book, for this scene alone. Three complaints here: 1) This much detail is totally inappropriate for a Christian book, in my opinion. Erotic literature is the equivalent of porn for women, and while Rivers avoids words that would technically make this \"erotic\"...well, there was enough to make me blush, feel embarrassed, and skip past a couple pages. Sometimes what isn't said explicitly is just as powerful as what is said explicitly.2) Once again, Joshua is just too perfect in how he handles the whole situation! Abra is obviously nervous about the wedding night with all the trauma she has suffered in that area, and he somehow does all the right things to make her feel completely comfortable and \"please\" her (eek, I feel weird even typing that, because this whole scene was embarrassing, even though I just skimmed it). Which leads me to my final point...3) Do you know how unrealistic this scene is? Real life couples often have to work for YEARS to overcome their sexual baggage and abusive pasts to have a healthy sexual relationship. The characters here just overcome all of Abra's issues in one passion-filled night, and it's completely absurd. I imagine this portrayal could be somewhat discouraging to people who are still working through sexual issues in their relationship.So I took off a few stars because of Joshua's ridiculous perfection, and what was in my opinion inappropriate sexual content. The story was good, but I could have done without those things I listed above."}, {"userName": "Dawn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1642306-dawn", "userReview": "This is probably one of the best books I've read so far this year, if not the BEST! Anyway. Moving on with my summary/review. :) There are slight spoilers to follow.Summary (my words): Abra Matthews was abandoned as a baby under the bridge in Haven. Though she was soon placed into the home of a loving family and then later adopted, she grows up guarded and wary. When a handsome LA playboy arrives in town, she throws her upbringing aside and runs away. Soon Abra realizes that the price she's paid isn't worth the Hollywood glamour of the 1950's. Given a new identity, Lena Scott, she soon becomes the newest thing on the silver screen since Marilyn Monroe, and few know her real name or the price she's paid to be somebody. Those who love her back home have prayed for her everyday in the hopes that someday, someway, somehow, Abra will find her way home. With God on her tail, her life disillusioned, she doesn't know who she is anymore. Can Abra bring herself to return home to those who love her - her family, her pastor, the young man who has been the best friend she's ever known?My thoughts: It has been a long time since I read a Francine Rivers book. I've read all of hers. While my personal favorite is (and still remains) Atonement Child, this one gripped me from the first page. I started this book late Monday night, brought it to work on Tuesday and finished it Tuesday night. Not since the times I read older Kingsbury novels, Joanne Bischoff's Cadence of Grace series, and Katie Ganshert's Broken Kind of Beautiful has a novel tore my heart out like this one did.Rivers has written the characters in such a way to cause the reader to feel for them. I found myself wanting to shake Abra while at the same time I was weeping for her. And Joshua. Yes, he was honorable. Yes, he was \"perfect.\" I loved his struggle in learning to trust. Pastor Zeke. I loved how he also struggled with letting go. For me, one of the most touching scenes was when Abra came home and runs into Pastor Zeke's waiting arms. Talk about a beautiful showing of forgiveness and redemption right there!Other reviews are saying that this may not be Francine's best. That's their opinion. In mine, this is going to fast become a favorite. Still, don't just take my word on how much I loved this book, read the opinions of others and make your own decision.I rented this book from the library and read it for pure pleasure (that and it's been on my reading list for ages and fit a Scattegories category on Goodreads).

Much to the chagrin of those who care about her, she travels to Hollywood and becomes known as film star Lena Scott. Though she is a natural at performing, the Tinseltown lifestyle makes her uncomfortable, and she questions the decision of abandoning her rural home...but, the bridges she has burned are ones she may never cross again.From Francine Rivers, the author of the best-selling Mark of the Lion trilogy.The Good: As evidenced by her best-selling Mark of the Lion trilogy, Francine Rivers is a very gifted writer. I'm a big entertainment fan, but, I know that what goes on behind the scenes in Hollywood often isn't pretty, and this book does a good job of portraying that. It also shows the undying love that families often have for their children, much like the father in the parable of the Prodigal Son. Pretty much impressive all around, except...The Bad: I wasn't a big fan of Abra's name. I have never known anyone with that name, and, when I read the book, I couldn't help but think of the teleporting psychic Pok\u00e9mon named Abra, which evolves into Kadabra and then into Alakazam. (See the wordplay there?) Though the name of the protagonist of this book was explained, it was still a bit weird to me.Content Concerns:Sex: A guy taking advantage of women is described. A woman is looked at lustfully, and talked about by guys in crude terms, albeit ones at a \"PG\" level. The book starts out with a childbirth scene. 3.5/5Nudity: A woman's immodest wardrobe is described. 4.5/5Language: Plenty of implied profanity, and one usage of the term \"d---ed\". 3.5/5Violence: Soldiers being injured during war is described. A guy commits suicide, though his wife is accused of murdering him. 3/5Drugs: Alcohol is consumed, and a character gets drunk. 4/5Frightening/Intense Scenes: A woman has an abortion. Plenty of arguing and dissension among the characters. 3/5Conclusion: Francine Rivers is best known for her Biblical historical fiction, but, with this book--set in the 1950's--she proves she is not a one-trick pony. Fans of her other works should definitely check this one out!Score: 4.5/5"}, {"userName": "Ruth Bonetti", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13368221-ruth-bonetti", "userReview": "It seemed a good holiday light read, and yes, there were times when it was a page-turner. But from the outset, I noted a preachy tone, which would limit readership to the flock. Characters fell into two camps; the goodies (so endless in patience and faith!) and the baddies (so dire, beware!), with our heroine Abra spanning the breach. She is an inevitable goodie, a rebellious one who must first discover the wages of sin and repent. Readers can empathise with her, despair for the depths she must plumb, while knowing it will all come good and her faithful Joshua will forgive all. This is the first book I've read by Francine Rivers, an author many colleagues highly esteem. So it was something of a let down to feel a ho hum response. Perhaps the characters needed more definition. We know only that Abra had red hair until her make-over to black; that Penny was blonde, that foster father Zeke prayed for his flock, that Joshua's war experiences left him bruised, but with little evidence of that played through his actions.

Over the years, I have enjoyed the Lineage of Grace series, Redeeming Love, and most recently (and my favourite) the two Marta\u2019s Legacy books. I fully expected to thoroughly enjoy Rivers\u2019 newest endeavour. But somehow Bridge to Haven didn\u2019t rise to the occasion for me. Abra is a broken, hurting teenage girl who wants to do life her way; not the way God, or anyone else might have her follow. As a result, she decides to venture into the world of her choosing, only to discover that the grass is not greener over on the other side. We watch as she experiences the path she chose with all of the searching and pining that goes along with it. While the story did succeed in pulling me in, there were several details that bothered me about this book. I won\u2019t go into specifics in hopes of not spoiling anything for you, but I feel the generalities must be said. First of all, some of the relationships in this book and their ambiguous lines between platonic and sexual really creeped me out. Even stepped over the line. Secondly, the ambivalence of those who watched Abra on her journey portrayed to me the exact opposite of what the author intended, per her afterword. They just seemed implausible, and ridiculous. The way her family and friends handled the whole situation was not a case of lovingly allowing her to experience life in her own way until she comes around, but it felt careless, almost complicit in her escapades. And thirdly, the amount of scripture, hymnal quotations, prayer, and christian rhetoric & cultural references, for me, went over the cliff and into the cheese pit of doom. I realize this book is a Christian book, and I myself am Christian. But I also think that there is a fine line between living a life of Christianity and living in a bubble where you are no longer relatable, possibly even alienating, to the rest of the world. This story moves a little too close to the latter. The Marta\u2019s Legacy books did a great job with this challenge (there was a clear stance on certain moral issues, and Christian practices were upheld without preaching all the time), and so I was expecting Bridge to Haven to be similar.I did enjoy this book, and the writing style that Francine Rivers employs is very engaging and emotion inducing. However, I would only recommend it to people who are already committed to Jesus, or who are searching for God. Anyone who finds a lot of praying and preaching within a book exasperating, you may find Bridge to Haven to be a tad grating.Did anyone else feel this way?Find other reviews and bookish stuff at www.bookmusings.com."}, {"userName": "Elena", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/588836-elena", "userReview": "It was OK, but very predictable and plain. It can make a good read for teenage girls to see how easy to get into the trouble when you follow just your opinion and ignore old friends warnings. 2 month later: I took time to think what was bothering me in this book. Once again, as in \"Hope of your mother\", there is an idea that good wife should close eyes on her talents and follow her husband doesn't matter what. As Marta from \"Hope of your mother\" was supposed to give up on her dream of boarding house and moved on absolutely non-perspective farming life her husband wanted, Abra also make a choice between her carrier as an actress, where she definitely has a talent, and a happy family life. Why here is such a choice, why can't it be both? I understand all importance of marriage, but I think if woman can also do what she love to do will make her more happy person, pleasant to be with. I'm really glad Francine Rivers didn't stop writing and can be both - good wife and mother and successful author we like."}, {"userName": "Mariejkt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20555294-mariejkt", "userReview": "I will say this up until this book of Francine Rivers I was a fan.

First, because there will only ever be one book like that, and second because Abra's story is her own. Redeeming Love took us to the California gold rush days and introduced us to a woman who had been forced into prostitution as a child. Bridge to Haven takes us to a small California town in the 1950's, and we meet a girl who is much loved but doesn't know it yet. Human imperfections all around her and a lack of answers about her own past send her seeking a future far away from everyone who really knows her. There is a battle here for Abra's life, love, and loyalty. She's a girl who thinks nobody wants her. Her biological mother left her to die. Her first father, Pastor Ezekiel, gave her up to another family because he thought they would be able to offer her more. That couple already had a daughter, and the girls at 16 have grown to be rivals, not comrades. The only person she truly trusts is Pastor Ezekiel's son. And even Joshua, barely in his twenties and just back from the Korean war, can't seem to convince her that he cares anymore. The brotherly teasing and hiking trips and cheeseburgers that used to connect them when she was a child no longer work. She craves love, and she's not recognizing it right in front of her, wrapped as it is in plain packaging. Abra is a girl who is uncertain about her own value. And all it takes to steal her heart is a little attention, somebody who desires her company and who makes that desire known. She's too young to tell when a romance is tainted. And so Abra disappears from her home town. This is the story of her leaving and her return. Slowly, painfully, step by step, she loses everything including her own sense of identity. Hollywood made her promises that it could never keep, and there is nothing left that she recognizes as the real Abra. And she doesn't dare imagine that anybody is out there, longing for her to come home. Yet that is exactly the case. The God who formed her, the man who found her naked and newborn, the boy who grew up with her and wants her to come back. They are all calling/whispering/waiting/seeking and urging her to come Home. Grace itself is beckoning to her broken heart, but does she dare to trust it? Again, this is not Redeeming Love. Don't ever go into one book expecting it to be the same as the author's others. This is a fine story all by its self. The first moments to the final scene, even the dark times in the middle.... it all comes together eventually. Great storytelling reminds us why we need to be comfortable in our own stories, because our Author too knows just when to introduce a character, never wastes a scene, and knows how to carry us through a terrible chapter. (Item of note: I really appreciated Joshua's character. I liked the fact that he had been a brother/friend to her for years. It makes their deep bond and growing romance real. It was their foundation, built out of childhood purity and tested by fire. I admire his continual belief in Abra as a human being, and the way he constantly reminded her that she did not need to save herself. That work had already been done. Another element I really like is the quotes above each chapter. Some were from Scripture, some from poetry, others from great men and women of the past.) Thank you Tyndale Summer Reading Program for my review copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Carla Palmeiro", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16530811-carla-palmeiro", "userReview": "I will be forever grateful to the amazing novelist Francine Rivers for writing some of my favorite books ever written \u2013 \u201cA Voice in the Wind\u201d and \u201cAn Echo in the Darkness\u2019\u201d from The Mark of the Lion series. Just out of curiosity, I just checked Goodreads and the former has an overall rating of 4.60 from a whopping 43.965 ratings. It is an amazing book that deserves all the praise and one that I know for sure will read again and again and will forever remain close to my heart.Unfortunately, her latest offering falls short of being amazing.I found the characters and overall plot to be somewhat similar to her biggest success \u2018Redeeming Love\u2019. There\u2019s no denying the similarities between Joshua and Abra and Michael Hosea and Angel from \u201cRedeeming Love\u201d.It is not an exiting book; it\u2019s actually rather predictable and uninspired.I like reading Christian fiction once in a while, especially after reading thriller after thriller, all those \u2018unpleasant\u2019 books full of psychopaths and unlikeable characters. I often find Christian books inspiring and uplifting and just what I need in time of doubt and uncertainty. There is a final \u2018twist\u2019; if you can call it one, almost at the very end and I challenge any reader that did not see that one coming from a mile away.Overall, I recommend this essentially to Francine Rivers admirers, Christian fiction enthusiasts and that\u2019s pretty much it. Not her best by a long shot but still a nice and pleasant read."}, {"userName": "Dara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1957541-dara", "userReview": "[ I could not get over the whole Joshua/Abra romance. I mean, had Marianne not died, this man, who ultimately becomes her HUSBAND, would have been her BROTHER. Joshua even mentions this in Chapter 20, I believe, right after they're married. I couldn't help but have a huge ICK factor thinking about it. Yes, I know they aren't blood related but for the first five years of her life and when he was age 5-10, they were essentially siblings. I guess I had a bigger issue with it because my husband's sister is adopted and the age difference is exactly the same and just... eh. I couldn't stop comparing it to that.

Few know her real name is Abra. Even fewer know the price she's paid to finally feel like she's somebody.To Pastor Ezekiel Freeman, Abra will always be the little girl who stole his heart the night he found her, a wailing newborn abandoned under a bridge on the outskirts of Haven. Zeke and his son, Joshua--Abra's closest friend--watch her grow into an exotic beauty. But Zeke knows the circumstances surrounding her birth etched scars deep in her heart, scars that leave her vulnerable to a fast-talking bad boy who proclaims his love and lures her to Tinseltown. Hollywood feels like a million miles from Haven, and naive Abra quickly learns what's expected of an ambitious girl with stars in her eyes. But fame comes at an awful price. She has burned every bridge to get exactly what she thought she wanted. Now, all she wants is a way back home.In this riveting and highly anticipated tale of temptation, grace, and unconditional love, \"New York Times\" best-selling author Francine Rivers delivers big-canvas storytelling at its very best.", "title": "Bridge to Haven", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18228202-bridge-to-haven", "average": 4.08, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1376078910l/18228202.jpg", "reviews": 1132, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6492.Francine_Rivers", "name": "Francine Rivers"}], "type": ["Christian Fiction", "Christian", "Fiction", "Historical", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18228202-bridge-to-haven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22110385-bridge-to-haven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18919635-bridge-to-haven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11422.Redeeming_Love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95617.A_Voice_in_the_Wind", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46601.An_Echo_in_the_Darkness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9943.The_Atonement_Child", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95621.As_Sure_as_the_Dawn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
