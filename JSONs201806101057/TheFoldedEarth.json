Set in Ranikhet, a little town in the Indian Himalaya, the story is sensitively, unsentimentally told. Lines flow like soothing music. Little wonder that this novel won the Hindu Literary Prize 2011 and made it to the Short List for the Man Asian Literary Prize in 2011.Maya, aged 25, lost her husband whom she had married against her family's wishes, in a mountaineering accident. She retreated to Ranikhet, a place where secrets were kept by the hills, to work in a church-run school and to heal. Roy surrounded Maya with a group of village folks, each rather endearing in his or her idiosyncratic ways. The character I treasured most was Puran, the dim-witted goat herd with a big heart who drew animals to himself like magic.I derived the greatest pleasure from taking in Roy\u2019s depiction of the sights and sounds of the Indian landscape - sky, flatland, hillsides, mountains, the chikoo trees, and the spiky dog rose. There was old world charm, no longer found in modern cities, but that perhaps still exists in some parts of the world such as this where goods were sold from gunny sacks and handcarts, where butchers sold marbled-eyed heads of slaughtered goats, and leopards (well, more alarming than charming) prowled the streets by night. Contrasting the \"choked cacophony of cars, motorbikes, scooters and trucks\" on narrow roads were the vivid scenes of the monsoon ravaged landscape and folks seeking solace by watching the rain, drinking tea, and gossiping.Maya\u2019s life was bound up with the secrets of her landlord, Diwan Sahib, and the enigmatic nephew, Veer, to whom she was unwittingly attracted. But the hills did unravel its secrets. Poetic justice was served but what lingered was the sadness that had deepened even more when the last page was turned."}, {"userName": "Susanna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2095801-susanna", "userReview": "The first 100 or so pages of this started out as strong as An Atlas of Impossible Longing, which I absolutely loved reading last year. I remember now why I love Anuradha Roy's writing so much - it comes off as enchanting and magical, and she says everything so eloquently and with occasional large words. I love how she interworks details from Indian history, archaeology, and culture with the main point of the story. But, unfortunately, I did not think that this book was anywhere near as fantastic as Roy's previous novel. The plot was very slow-paced, and if not for Roy's great writing, I would probably have been bored enough to struggle finishing the book. The storyline meandered, never truly reaching what was expected from reading the book's blurbs. I didn't feel like the story and characters were as well-developed as they could have been, and the overall plot seemed to be missing some cohesive element. I think, on the last page, I finally grasped some of the points Roy was trying to make with the novel. The Folded Earth is worth a read - Roy's writing is still wonderful and there are some interesting points to the book - but if you're choosing between it and An Atlas of Impossible Longing, go with the latter!"}, {"userName": "Chaitra", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9086236-chaitra", "userReview": "It started well, and Roy writes well grammatically. I kept turning the pages, but so many things bothered me. It bothered me that she would lamely end one of her two perspectives - the interesting one too. Charu goes to Delhi in search of a guy that doesn't seem interested in her anymore. The next we know of her is a couple of lines is in Maya's chapter - that she got married and is in Singapore. Huh? It bothered me that after all the build up to it, Charu (and Maya) goes scot free after her attempt to flee.It bothers me that Maya never confronts Veer with what she realizes about him. Instead she decides he is a culprit, a bad guy. He does seem to be a nasty person - but it would have been nice to have his perspective on things as well. But, he spends large portions of the book off the page. We never get to know Veer's side. This is true of the politics Roy stuffs this book as well. There's a so called undercurrent of political awareness in the book, that increases the page count, but adds to nothing else. The description of the book is misleading. There is nothing Maya truly fights for - hers is only a lip-service. We get elaborately introduced to the two competing politicians, and Roy lets us know which one she prefers is practically every line of the book. Except we don't even know which party won the election so tightly contested for. Except Roy never makes a sufficient case for us to swallow that the party that she doesn't prefer is actually terrible other than the fact that she says so. It bothers me most that Maya gets total control of the Diwan's will. And she rips it apart as a revenge for the crimes Veer has committed. Yeah ok, but the will has other beneficiaries Maya, not just two willful whiny brats born to riches. The other beneficiaries of the will are all much poorer, longer faithful ly served the Diwan, and would lose out without anything without the will. And yet this bitch (and the author) spares not a thought for any of them. So there you go, Maya really fights for nothing. Not even herself. She just judges people in her own head and executes them without ever telling them she did or giving them an excuse to explain their side. It's hard to care about this book."}, {"userName": "Mmars", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2243098-mmars", "userReview": "Very quietly, Roy focuses on the remote corners of the heart and India. Sadness permeates the hamlet while nature's beauty encompasses it. This quote, late in the book, exemplifies Roy's prowess and provides a window into the story as well:\"In winter, the air is clear enough to drink, and your eyes can travel many hundreds of miles until they reach the green of the near hills, the blue-gray beyond them, and then the snow peaks far away, which rise in the sky with the sun, and remain suspended there, higher than imaginable, changing color and shape through the day. Every hour, they come closer, their massive flanks clearly visible, plumes of cloud smoking from their tips. After the last of the daylight is gone, at dusk, the peaks still glimmer in the slow-growing darkness as if jagged pieces of the moon had dropped from sky to earth.These are secrets hidden from those who escape the Himalaya when it is at its bleakest: the mountains do not reveal themselves to people who come here merely to escape the heat of the plains. Through the summer they veil themselves in a haze. The peaks emerge for those devoted to them through the coldest of winters, the wettest of monsoons. The mountains, Diwan Sahib said in an uncharacteristic rush of sentimentality fueled by a few drinks at his fireplace, believe that love must be tested by adversity.\"This is a book for readers who like to luxuriate in their reading. Roy tells you what is happening but compels you only occasionally to keep going. Too often, I found myself struggling to keep awake, which may be attributed to my life being too hectic lately. Wish I'd read this when I could have been more dedicated to my reading."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12123802-julie", "userReview": "Beautifully written story of the tension between urban and rural life, as well as between the colonial era and modernity, in contemporary India. Maya, recently widowed, is reeling from the loss of her photographer/trekker husband, Michael, and is already estranged from her family for marrying outside her religion. She moves to the cantonment town of Ranikhet, near the western peaks of the Himalayas, in hopes of forgetting and moving on with a completely different lifestyle and cast of characters in her new world. Still, political tensions and modern ways of living are even encroaching on this place, where everyone knows everyone else (and everyone else's business). Loved the evocative descriptions of the natural world as well as the characters: some humorous, some poignant, some with a darker side, but all worth knowing."}, {"userName": "Mark Staniforth", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4106933-mark-staniforth", "userReview": "It takes a special writer to fashion something out of the ordinary from such a conventional subject: in this case, the much-plundered, Kipling-esque tale of rural India's struggle to shake off the remnants of the Raj and embrace an uneasy new political and religious future.Anuradha Roy, however, has lifted 'The Folded Earth' far above the dangers of cliche, both with the shimmering beauty of her prose and the effortless manner in which she unfurls a tale rich in warmth and humour, yet never straying far from its delicate, dark heart.'The Folded Earth' is about love, loss and longing as much as it about the corruptive influence of politics and religion: the fragility of everyday existence in the mountain villages of Himalaya mirrored by the uneasy peace among Hindus, Christians and Muslims, which is already spilling blood in the valleys below.Maya, a young schoolteacher, escapes to the mountains following the death of her husband in a climbing accident, seeking and at first finding a happiness of sorts. She helps an eccentric scholar, Diwan Sahib, complete his life's work and forges a precious friendship with Charu, a peasant girl who lives on his estate.When Charu falls in love with a visiting hotel cook, and Diwan's nephew Veer arrives to set up a trekking company, Maya's dream of solitude is shattered. Elections are approaching, and the rise in Hindu nationalism threatens the future of her school and the life she and the locals have forged around it.Roy's work is a masterpiece of restraint. She conjures a world of such verdant beauty it must surely have been tempting to destroy it: juxtaposing her poetic descriptions with a brutality which shatters its inherent tranquility to devastating effect.Many have done it; many others have resisted the temptation so entirely as to render their works little more than glorified travelogues; bright pictures of magical, distant lands. Roy has achieved both: content to let the dark forces lurk without ever quite manifesting themselves, she lends an extra potency and poignancy to almost all of the central characters' choices. Their lives as they know it are, you sense, hanging by a thread no stronger than the one which Charu tears superstitiously from her dupatta to tie to temple railings at the beginning of her greatest journey.'The Folded Earth' is a book about the power and glory of nature, and the struggle of the human spirit to establish itself therein. The politics - and threats - ebb and flow through the scorching hot summers and frozen winters, but the mountains, and the mountain people, remain.'The Folded Earth' - longlisted for the MAN Asian Literary Prize, and surely a strong contender - is a beautiful book that will not leave you until long after the final page. There, you will find what is perhaps Roy's ultimate anti-cliche: a happy (ish) and eminently satisfactory ending - for the time being, at least."}, {"userName": "Garry", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4480042-garry", "userReview": "Maya is a city girl, married to a man with a passion for mountain climbing. When he dies on an ill-fated trip, she leaves Bangalore and takes up a job as a teacher in the village of Ranikhet, near where the accident occurred. The Folded Earth, which Maya narrates, tells of how she finds her place within the small community, and learns to move on from her husband's death.'I enjoyed this book for most of its length. Maya could easily have been a 'doctor/policewoman/vet' from London moving to a remote community in the Scottish Highlands. It read like a charming and comforting BBC series. Even Ranikhet, which seemed like a relic of a British colonial outpost, felt familiar and safe. It was definitely Indian though, and this became more and more obvious as the story unfolded. However, The Folded Earth would definitely make a decent introduction to Indian literature for those who don't like to be 'culture-shocked' by their books. (let me give you a tip... if you've never dipped your toe into Indian literature it's definitely something you should try)I had every intention of giving The Folded Earth 4 stars: it was lovely in a lot of respects, and I found myself consistently wanting to visit Ranikhet, but at the same time it seemed a little insubstantial. It contained a series of charming vignettes, but didn't seem to contain any real punch.Unfortunately, the punch did eventually come. I hope it's not a spoiler to say that the tone of the novel completely changed a few chapters from the end. I don't mean that there were plot twists... I mean that it suddenly turned nasty. It's one thing to have a sting the tail, but this was ridiculous. The Folded Earth didn't stay true to itself, and was completely spoiled for me as a result. I now only want to give it 2 stars, something I didn't imagine was possible 50 pages from home.I'm not very good at picking out the messages in the books I read - I just like experiencing them. I can definitely see some bigger themes in this one though, so the author was obviously successful in getting me to think. However, that doesn't change the fact that I really disliked the ending."}, {"userName": "Chad Walker", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74961-chad-walker", "userReview": "It's really, really beautiful writing. Roy creates a kind of hypnotic, dream-like state with her descriptions: for example, I remember a passage (I think around p. 150), where she describes the monsoon season in this hill town in such evocative, original language I had to read it three times. And that seems to be how Roy works: despite jumps in chronology or point of view, her very consistent, very poetic voice stitches together those pieces into a long-frame continuity. And it is a very touching portrait of a far-off place whose defining characteristic isn't so much that it's Indian as that it's rural and mostly poor. This is an alternative (welcome) view of our 21st Century, globalized adventure.I had two reservations, though. First, the voice is so consistent, I found it could have used a little modulation. I like slow/quiet books, but a surprising amount of this one just seemed forgettable. Even when major plot points unfold, or even in more active scenes, the voice didn't really vary much from the overall descriptive/poetic one. Secondly, I thought the plot was a little unsatisfying. Again, I'm perfectly happy with unresolved endings, but I thought there was a lot of work done here to set up a couple of major conflicts, and then they were just kind of lumped together without any real resolution one way or another at the end. I think the ending needed to be a little bit longer, a little more nuanced, and we needed to see how some of this tension un-folded from the earth of these hills.Still, great writing, and it made me curious to check out her earlier work."}, {"userName": "Sairam Krishnan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8056568-sairam-krishnan", "userReview": "With The Folded Earth, I have now read all of Anuradha Roy's novels. Like the others, this one is, too, a beautiful, felt story, told gorgeously. I will return to all of them again soon enough, as I think they deserve rereads, but something I have noted in Roy, something I have come to expect, is sheer atmosphere. Like how I could feel the riverine world that holds together the early parts of An Atlas of Impossible Longing, and the sea in Sleeping on Jupiter seems to frame the world itself, The Folded Earth's Himalayas are such a presence that you can almost feel the mountain wind on you. I will return to this novel again, because I don't think I have caught all of its undercurrents yet. I have felt this about all of Roy's books: that though I read them with such joy, I couldn't quite 'get' them.

It is, however, a good story and a lovely read. The writing is beautiful, especially her descriptions of the environment--the novel is in a sense a love letter to the Himalayan foothills where she lives. I also wonder if the author was aiming this book at a more Western audience than the first. It is a much more straightforward story and probably more accessible to those who know little about India beyond Passage to India or the Raj Quartet.  Writing a novel in the first person presents difficulties. It is very hard for the novelist to show us what is going on in the other characters' heads. Consequently, many of the characters are rather stock: \"the administrator,\" \"the general,\" \"the politicians,\" even Charu: \"the lovely peasant girl with her goats.\" The fullest character is definitely Diwan Sahib, living in his aristocratic past, then also the elderly Ama and her son who talks to animals. Veer is a cipher. The sub-plot about the politicians is not well-developed and we are told almost nothing about what their policies are except that one, presumably BJP, is anti-Christian.  Maya herself comes across as very naive, impulsive, and not at all self-aware. There is little introspection about what is going on around her. For example, we can see that Charu's story has obvious parallels to her own story with Michael, but if Maya sees this and realizes that this is a reason for her sympathy for Charu, she doesn't tell us she thinks about it. We are told so little about her life with Michael that we don't get much sense of his character except he rides a motorbike and loves the mountains, and consequently I found it hard to feel her grief or understand her impulsive decision to go live near where he died. (That's not really a spoiler as we are told about his death in the first few pages.)SPOILER ALERT Maya has been living in Ranikhet for five years before Veer appears. Why does she tell us so little about her life apart from her relationship with Diwan Sahib and Charu, and her appreciation of the beauty of the country? Yes, she tells us a bit about her teaching (mainly that she really isn't interested in it) and the jam factory, but she doesn't SHOW us much. I would love, for example, to heave heard more about the school. Why doesn't she find the teaching fulfilling? Why doesn't she work harder at it? She doesn't enlighten us. And why do she and Veer fall for each other?? Does he remind her of Michael? Is she lonely and he is the first reasonably acceptable male she comes across?? Why does he get involved with her?? Guilt about Michael's death would seem to be a reason to run away from her, not to have an affair. Because Maya is the narrator we can't see Veer's motivation. We can see that Veer has another side, but she refuses to see it. That's pretty naive--she believes him when she finds him searching the house and he says he is looking for his \"uncle's\" medical records and pushes her out. Why the big secret? She KNOWS that Diwan Sahib probably has some valuable letters between Nehru and Lady Mountbatten hidden somewhere that EVERYONE wants to get their hands on. Moreover, she never confronts Veer for supplying Diwan Sahib with booze and cigarettes, though she can see that it is ruining his health, which makes her in some sense complicit in his death. And at the end, her act is impulsive. Maybe revenge is understandable, but again, there is little introspection involved. She is punishing everyone, including herself, not just Veer. I was left with no deep understanding of her. In short, I liked Diwan Sahib, Ama, Puran, Charu and Kundan, but I just didn't like Maya much, or feel much sympathy for her, and I don't know if that is what the author intended."}, {"userName": "Nesa Sivagnanam", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/315458-nesa-sivagnanam", "userReview": "In marrying a Christian, the narrator, Maya, has become estranged from her wealthy family in Hyderabad. But after six happy years together, her husband has died in a mountaineering accident. Rather than return to her parents, she seeks refuge in Ranikhet, a town that looks toward the mountains that so entranced her husband. Overcome with grief, she stows away his backpack, recovered from the scene of the accident, and refuses to inspect its contents. She can\u2019t bear to know the details surrounding his death.In Ranikhet, Maya settles into a routine: teaching at a Christian school; spending time with her landlord, Diwan Sahib; and observing the sometimes comic rhythms of the village and its army garrison. Roy manages to capture both the absurd and the sinister in even minor characters, like a corrupt local official who embarks on a beautification plan that includes posting exhortatory signs around town. (One, meant to welcome trekkers, is vandalized to read \u201cStreaking route.\u201d) His crusade, inspired by the Sing\u00adaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who embraced caning as a punishment, also includes the persecution of a simple-\u00adminded but harmless herder.Of course, a sedate world exists only to be shaken, and soon enough the town is disturbed from all sides. An election brings issues of religion to the fore, threatening to stir sectarian violence. Curious military maneuvers prompt rumors of Chinese spies and fears of a border conflict with Pakistan. Diwan Sahib\u2019s nephew, Veer, a mountaineering guide, moves into the elderly man\u2019s villa, and Maya finds herself drawn to him, despite the bad habits he encourages in his uncle and, more alarmingly, his tendency to disappear without warning."}, {"userName": "Book Him Danno", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/872245-book-him-danno", "userReview": "This book started out with a good flow but about the half-way point it slowed down. I had to push through the pages to pick the story up again and with that the flow increased. The lives of the people living in this remote area of India were interesting and diverse. The sadness and loss I felt in the beginning returned at the end. Such heartbreak and despair for one person seems unbearable. The relationships Maya experienced in her life were varied and yet each left its mark on her personality and life. Friends, lovers, family, all of them made life difficult yet worth living. I could feel Maya\u2019s pain and loss. She is a character I may keep around awhile. The ending hit me hard and I have to say that I do not entirely disagree with Maya\u2019s decision. She had been wronged in so many ways by someone she thought loved her, one more wrong may just make a right. I wish the book had given me a better idea of where Maya went and how her life turned out.I enjoyed this book more than I did this authors first work, Atlas of Impossible Longing. If you enjoy stories of life, loss, love and finding peace, I think you will like this book.

I really liked that book. Then I read \"An Atlas of Impossible Longing\" a few months later and thought it equally beautiful. And now I have read \"The Folded Earth\" and Roy has done it again. She writes beautifully: there's nothing flamboyant about her writing, but it is a joy to read. Her characters feel real. The places they live feel real.This book is a story primarily about a woman and a girl. The woman is a widow and coming to terms with the tragic loss of her husband. The girl is her neighbour who \"loses\" the love of her life when he goes away to work. Will Maya find love again? Will Charu's stand the test of separation? And meanwhile, what is Veer doing with his sudden disappearances and unpredictable returns? And what is happening in town with the elections? And...there's a lot of questions bouncing around through the book and my only criticism is that everything seemed to get explained rather quickly at the end. Although, thinking about it, I quite liked that: a few sudden twists and turns and no messing around with long-winded denouements, so perhaps that isn't actually a criticism.I hope Anuradha Roy writes some more fiction!"}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/235074-ruth", "userReview": "Beautiful, beautiful. It's Maya's (quiet but gripping) personal story, but it's also the story of the north India town, Ranikhet, where she goes to make a new life after her young husband's untimely death. The author lives in Ranikhet & says (in an interview at the end of the book) that in the novel, & the map at the front of the book, which she has drawn herself, it is fictionalized. The textures, sounds, topography, sky, plants, & animals of the place--as well as the human residents--are rendered lovingly & with humor. I feel as if I've lived there.The story does not tie up neatly at the end. I think that works--a couple of very, very sad realities have come to light, neither of which can be resolved easily. But there's one odd discrepancy that seems unintentional. At various points in the story Diwan Sahib (a major character) is being threatened with nonrenewal of the lease for his home--which is said to belong to the army--but at other points, including at the end, it is said to have belonged to his family for a long time & to still be his.

Corbett is summoned from the forgotten pages of history and adored. The eccentrics gather for gossip beneath deodars, and even the plaintive is grandiose. Such a contained, elegant piece of work that is still manages fluidity and is full of lucid desire. An affectionate book, copious in longing and lyricism, sensitive to the human condition, observant and sentimental. A slow elegy, edged with the subversive, smooth unpredictability of a body of prose that mounts to achieve definition towards the very end. An attempt to attest that life perhaps is without conclusion, that the beauty of existence is often inexplicable within the grief or yearn it presents.

The beautiful descriptions are as much a reason for reading this book as the characters that people it. It made me feel nostalgia for a bygone era and I almost never appreciate books that attempt to show the past as a better place. Perhaps because it relied on a kind of people from the past to evoke that feeling. Brave, committed, and with a very romantic worldview that I can't help but admire even as I feel it is naive.
