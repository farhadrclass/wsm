Zubaidah Haque experiences a liberated life at Harvard where she becomes a paleontologist, participates in a dig at Baluchistan, Pakistan, to search for the walking whale,Ambulocetus, and then move back to Bangladesh to get married to her childhood friend, Rashid. She leaves behind the love of her life. The book is an epistle to Elijah Strong in which the explains her decisions to him. She struggles to find her footing in life as a result of her history as an adopted child, the country's political upheavals, and the cultural anomalies between her adopted country and her motherland.The text is atmospheric, rich, intense, captivating, spicy, strong, lyrical, written with a melancholic elegance. The narrative is fundamentally beautiful. Historical fiction reigns supreme. The love story pulls all the events and issues together, instead of being a mainstream diluted untruth for love-addicts. Hardships, tragedy, resilience, pride, loyalty, family values, social inequalities, and cultural treasures vividly fill up the pages with colorful vistas. British novelist, Tahmima Anam, concludes the Bengal trilogy with this book covering the history of Bangladesh's freedom struggle and revolution. I accidentally started out with this book, instead of the first book, A Golden Age. The second book in the series is titled The Good Muslim. The series addresses the history of a grandmother, a daughter and then the adopted granddaughter in the ever changing political arena of the country. In this respect it reminds me of Wild Swans - Three daughters of China by Jung Chang.  I am a bit between a rock and a hard place with this book. I really enjoyed the experience, however ...... it left me exhausted instead of inspired. Somewhere along the road, it lost me in too much word dumping, too many characters and an overall messiness in texture and scope. Although it was highly informative, it also tried to cover too many issues, turning the drama into mediocre overkill. Even the ending became one long unnecessary explanation of the obvious. That's a personal opinion. It could have been a powerful tour de force. However, someone killed the possibility and it was not the reader. Instead of 'WOW!' at the last concluding sentence, it ended with 'Thank You Universe it's finally over!' - for me, at least. Someone should have told the protagonist to just stop talking. A good editor, for instance. But that's just me.However, curiosity will not only kill a few cats. Somewhere along the line, I want to read the other two books in this series as well.

Each sentence is musical, yet thoroughly conversational, so that it reads as a halting, emotional confession, full of additions and qualifications. It's so personal that I followed the story with a tightness in my chest and sometimes tears in my eyes. Tahmima Anam is a real talent, not just in style but in her creation of character. So rarely do I leave a book believing that I know a person so thoroughly, that I understand their choices so well. She addresses the tensions in individual identity; how someone can be pulled in opposing directions by love, culture, science, history. I didn't realise that this was the last part of a trilogy. As powerful as this was alone, I'm looking forward to reading the others and adding an even richer sense of the past to this generational story.

This is a beautifully and lyrically written novel about a woman's search for who she really is given that she is adopted and caught between two cultures. She is based in the US and is a paleontologist looking to understand who she is. In a compelling narrative, the tale penetrates what are the deepest parts of a human being. Inevitably, that touches on love and family. She wants to get in touch on her Bangladeshi connections. So we encounter issues of class and culture whilst coming to terms with the past and the present. The characterisation is done well and invested with emotional intensity and insights.

Not just in those days together in Cambridge, but in the aftermath, when I couldn\u2019t stop talking about you, when every turn of my story included a footnote of conversation as I pictured how you might respond, the way the desert light would catch your hair, the effect of the parched, history-heavy air on your voice. What would you have made of all this, the green flags of our tents on the lunar surface of this ancient place, our little argument with time\u201dThe Bones of Grace is the final book in the loosely connected Bengal trilogy by British Bangladeshi writer, novelist and columnist, Tahmima Anam. Zubaida Haque is writing to the man she fell in love with one Cambridge afternoon at a Shostakovich Preludes concert. Elijah Strong is not the man she married, but Zubaida is writing to explain what led to her the actions that she knows broke his heart. The story she tells, parts of which he of course knows well, details their first meeting, just days before she departed for an archaeological dig in Pakistan. As a palaeontologist, Zubaida has been selected to help unearth the bones of the \u201cwalking whale\u201d, Ambulocetus, near a remote village. But events conspire to put her back in her hometown, Dhaka, much sooner than expected, and she finds the pressure to enter into the expected marriage, too much to resist. Anam\u2019s extensive research into many topics is apparent on every page and she manages to include a myriad of interesting subjects in her narrative: as well as the evolution of the whale and archaeology digs, she explores the industry of ship-breaking, the plight of ex-pat construction workers in Dubai, undocumented adoption and the search for a birth mother, and for a long-lost lover. She weaves a wealth of curious facts into a plot that itself is mesmerising, and does so with some gorgeous descriptive prose. \u201cThe light came in as we waited, and then there it was, a sliver on the horizon. We watched as it grew. More of the men arrived, wiping the sleep from their eyes. The curve of the ship began to appear, and now we could see the gleam of the hull, a poem of curves rising out of the remnants of dark, and suddenly it was before us, as if it had turned a sharp corner, white, immense, violent\u201d and \u201cShe is a person with guilt at the very core of her being, and she spends her days compensating others for the fortune that brought her a life, a marriage, me. She is a moral economy all to herself, painted in tiny strokes of the past\u201d are examples.Anam\u2019s characters are multifaceted, all have flaws, and the reader cannot help but care about their fate. While this novel is part of a trilogy, it can easily be read as a stand-alone, but readers are likely to want to seek out the earlier books by this talented author.

We originally met Zubaida very briefly during the epilogue of The Good Muslim, so that's where I started, re-reading that part to recalibrate my familiarity with the characters.As this story begins, PhD candidate Zubaida is preparing to leave Harvard to join an expedition in Pakistan to dig up a whale fossil; the skeleton of Ambulocetus natans, the walking whale. In her final week she meets Elijah Strong, a drop-out from the university's Philosophy doctoral program. Despite Zee's departure hanging over them, and her admission that she is promised to someone else, the two fall a bit in love and vow to keep in touch. The excavation in Pakistan is unexpectedly cut short, and Zee returns to her family in Dhaka, rudderless. There she decides to move ahead with the marriage to her childhood friend, Rashid, and put her feelings for Elijah behind her. Early on in the marriage, tragedy strikes, and this is the catalyst for Zee relocating to Chittagong without Rashid. Within a short time she finds herself with an unexpected job opportunity - helping a foreign crew making a documentary about the labourers working in the ship-breaking industry along the coast. There Zee meets Mo and Anwar, and through circumstances of her own making, once again comes into Elijah's orbit.There is another storyline about Zee being adopted that is equally as important as the Elijah thread, but it's difficult for me to explain how this fits in without spoilers. Suffice to say, Zee was told she was adopted on her 9th birthday and then it was never mentioned again. As she struggles to reconcile her feelings for Rashid and Elijah, she almost tries to distract herself with a growing desire to find out where she came from and who her mother is.For me, this book was not as good as #1, but distinctly more enjoyable than #2. I would have rated it higher but for the fact that I just wasn't convinced by the depth of feeling that Zubaida supposedly had for Elijah and also for her need to understand her background. For example, she called it her 'quest' at a point where all she had really done was ask a few questions of her parents and in-laws. It seemed more like a curiosity than a quest to me. And with Elijah, there was tenderness and affection but none of the hallmarks of a grand passion that disrupts lives. However, while it looked to be heading towards a solid 3\u2605 read, what redeemed it and earned the extra half\u2605 was the ending. So much happened in the last 10% of the book!But now I'm having mixed feelings because after I'd settled on a rating, another reviewer brought to my attention a book named The Geometry of God, written by a Pakistani writer and published in 2008 (7 or 8 years before The Bones of Grace).

Anam weaves a complex story of journeying and search: for history, for a sense of self, for acceptance and for homecoming. Along the way we have a glorious portrait of a love affair, of various marriages, and of Bangladesh: its hierarchical social structures, its past struggle for independence, its abuses and its beauties.What makes this book so impressive is Anam's narrative control and her ability to view the world and characters with complexity rather than reductively. It's a mark of her sophisticated vision that the place of greatest human abuse is also where Zubaida experiences her greatest happiness; that the haunting image of the skeleton of a prehistoric whale is matched by the vision of a ship being stripped back to its bare timbers beached on the sand. It can be difficult to create empathy for a protagonist who is inclined to passivity but here, too, Anam pulls it off: Zubaida's motivations are sometimes opaque but its precisely this quality which makes her feel so real.

From the moment you start reading you know there can be no happy ending - there is just too much 'human' in this book for any convenient, Hollywood resolution. Seemingly about a long distance love between a wholesome American and a Bangladeshi palaeontologist (stick with me here..) this book traverses the world and through time to conjure Bangladesh in colourful yet brutal beauty. I think this book is actually about the conflicts of identity experienced by everyone, but especially by those who leave behind their country to embrace cultures elsewhere. It's also about the idea that some people have 'dreams that are too big for their life'. Aspiration and ambition are concepts which many of us see as positive, but for those who have absolutely no chance or hope of changing their situation they simply lead to unhappiness, dissatisfaction, or worse. By no means fast paced, there are enough unexpected twists and heart stopping moments to make this much more than the love story it seems to have been billed as in the publishers blurb.

I could see no connection between this and her 'A Golden Age' and 'The Good Muslim'.Secondly, it felt very much as if this was a series of longer short stories masquerading as a single novel. One moment we're involved in the love life of the main character and narrator, Zubaida. Then we're on an adventure looking for the bones of a long dead whale. Then suddenly we're ship-breaking on the beaches of Cox's Bazaar, Bangladesh. Along the way we seem to randomly learn the story of Anwar - of whom I expected there to be an obvious sting in the tale, but it wasn't to be. These all felt like good ideas which ran out of steam and were then discarded by the author.Nevertheless, I loved the storytelling and Anam's usual easy style which weaves you into the lives of the characters so gracefully. So I carried on, setting aside my hopes for the book in the wake of her first two excellent novels.If, in reading this book, you feel the same disappointments then I must say: Keep going!As the book neared the end, the threads pulled together and, instead of separate pictures roughly sown together as I expected, it turned out that everything made one larger picture - and that picture was beautiful.For me, the test of a good novel is this: Do I care what happens to the characters in the future? Do I feel I don't want the story to end? Anam's book passes this test with flying colours. I was heartbroken when the story had to end and I have found it hard to extract myself from the lives of the players within ever since.If truth be told, I would probably rate this 4.5 rather than a full 5/5 as it is not absolutely perfect. There are one or two messy bits, one or two parts which I didn't feel tied up completely or added to the novel. But then, in one sense, that's just what Anam is writing about here. An imperfect world, with imperfect people and imperfect love. Nothing has to add up completely to make a perfect sum. Indeed, a refreshing change is the complete absence of genuine 'bad guys' in this story. There are less flawed characters and more flawed characters - each with their own good and bad points. This was especially true of the narrator herself who readily admits to being a coward and breaking the heart of Elijah, who deserved so much better (although he himself is flawed, revealing a selfish youth just a little at one point). While many novels today are taking the 'flawed hero' line, Anam's book succeeds with me because usually I find myself unsympathetic to such characters, but not here. Zubaida's plight and her thoughts and reactions I could understand and appreciate. She is not entirely unlike me, I thought throughout the story. Perhaps that is why I loved her so much.In short, this is a beautiful book full of Bangladeshi life, full of the reality of what that means yet also so full of hope, peace and love. The enigma of Bangladesh is that it is both a beautiful place and a terrible one; born of a history which is both tragic and inspiring. Anam manages to capture this dual, split-personality of the country and people absolutely perfectly. For that, she demands my highest praise and my deepest thanks."}, {"userName": "Julia Thomas-Singh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32906981-julia-thomas-singh", "userReview": "THis book is so much like The Geometry of God by Uzma Aslam Khan that I am shocked.

In The Geometry of God,which came out in 2008, a young girl Amal finds the fossil of an ancient whale, the 'dog-whale,' that evoloved on land, with legs. She finds it on a dig in Pakistan with her grandfather, a paleontologist whose name is Zahoor, whose names means 'becoming', evolving, in-between. Amal wants to be a paleontologist like her grandfather but is told to stay home to look after her blind sister. But she does end up becoming the first woman paleontologist in Pakistan, working with men, despite society and family pressure. Tell me if this doesn't sound familiar. The Geometry of God was a Kirkus Reviews best book of 2009 but it seems not many people here have heard of it or the 'coincidence' would have been noted. I will give you that their writing styles aren't the same, but, ironically, Khan wrote this on pp 212 of the US edition of The Geometry of God \"Suppose I reassemble the bones wrong and the copy in no way resembles the original?

And in between this beautiful mess, Anam\u2019s protagonist, Zubaida narrates how her life completely changed when she fell in love with Elijah Strong.Most of the June I was busy with Tahmima Anam\u2019s Bangladesh series, and the books have totally swept me off my feet. They have kept me engaged and longing for more knowledge about the country and its people which is across the border. While the first two books focus on the Bangladesh Liberation war and footsteps of Islamism in the newly liberated country, The Bones of Grace follows the life of Zubaida Haque aka Zee, who is Maya\u2019s adopted daughter. Both Maya and her husband inform Zubaida on her 9th birthday that she is adopted, but they never knew that this knowledge would be embedded so deep into Zubaida\u2019s heart that she will start spinning her life around it.In The Bones of Grace, Zubaida is writing a letter to Elijah Strong, the blue-eyed boy whom she met in a darkened concert hall in Boston, day before she was planning to go on a digging expedition to Tethys Sea in Pakistan to find the bones of a walking whale, which she had given the name of \u201cDiana\u201d. Elijah and Zubaida form an instant connection, something that Zubaida has never felt with anyone else. She sets on solving this evolutionary puzzle to settle her mind that is churning a thousand questions about her future after the dig in Dhaka. The dig also gives her solace from the fact she will give back something to the society, just like her parents have been doing, replenishing society after the Bangladesh War.The dig doesn\u2019t go as planned as a local team member falls into the grip of Balochistan Insurgency. And at the end of the day, they had to leave \u201cDiana\u201d half uncovered and half buried in the sand and go back to their home. As soon as she returns, life takes a full swing. She is married off to Rashid, her long time family friend and boyfriend, settles down eventually only to realize the pain of loss yet again when she suffers a miscarriage.To find the true self and remove the scars of life, she leaves for Chittagong, the family resort, and from there to a shipping yard, where world\u2019s many ships are taken down piece by piece, to be sold off. In Chittagong, Zubaida comes across Grace, recently arrived to be sold, and she has to cover the life of workers of the ship who will take her down. She also meets Anwar, a shipbreaker whose story holds a key that unlocks the past of Zubaida\u2019s life, and a chance for a new life as well. In the shadow of the ship being torn down to its bones, Zubaida will make some decisions from which she can never turn back.When I started reading The Bones of Grace, I didn\u2019t know that I have to be very patient with the story. But then after a few pages, I came across this line \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for parsing out the story slowly, Elijah. These things take time.\u201dAnd that is when I understood that the story is much bigger than I am thinking. And my, it truly is. When you read The Bones of Grace, you will relate to the confusion and feelings of Zubaida Haque. You will come across a new little world of Chittagong, where ships are stripped down to be sold off. And the feeling by which Chittagong is described, you won\u2019t be able to keep the book down. From Diana to those of ships that land up to be pulled apart in this highly exploitative ecosystem, an amazing relationship of evolution has been shown between a living and a non-living. Though I would have really liked if the story could have been a little fast paced and not so extra descriptive, The Bones of Grace will definitely take a place in your heart. And do not rush with the story, let it work it\u2019s magic on you. Some of you might feel like giving up on The Bones of Grace, but then you will loose out on a story which is magnificent. Zubaida\u2019s character is someone who has been marred young by the fact of her adoption. Since then, she always looks around for a purpose, or for someone whom she could relate to. She finds her purpose first in the dig of Diana, but then that is taken away from her. She relates herself to Elijah when she comes to back to Dhaka, texting their feelings using song titles. Zubaida may appear confused and disoriented to many readers, but if you carefully decipher her feelings, she is one of those many people trying to find their roots. She is strong, yet she is vulnerable at the core. And she is something that will always be etched in your memory.I have spent my half June with Tahmima Anam, and I simply love her stories. Make sure to pick up your copies and devour into the roller coaster ride of love, lost and found. Now I am off to sipping my tea, patiently waiting for her next book."}, {"userName": "Lila", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4656570-lila", "userReview": "The Bones of Grace is the third novel of the Bangla Desh Trilogy by Tahmima Anam and tells the story of Zubaida, the adopted daughter of a wealthy Bangladeshi family in Dhaka. Zubaidah Haque is a Harvard educated marine palaeontologist engaged to her childhood friend Rashid. At a concertina Boston, shortly before her departure for Pakistan to work on a dig for bones of \"Diana\" an Ambulocetus, or \"walking whale\", she encounters a young man named Elijah Strong. The Bones of Grace is basically a long letter to Elijah explaining her actions. After working on the dig several months, the project is discontinued because of conflicts involving the local tribesmen and Pakistani police. Dejected, Zubaidah returns to Bangladesh. Under pressure of her family and against her better judgement, she marries Rashid. Unsatisfied with what to her feels like the superficial lifestyle of the Bangladeshi elite, along with the realization that Elijah is the love of her life, she moves to Chittagong to work on a documentary film about the beaches where ships are destroyed and workers or \" shipbreakers\" are inhumanly exploited. While working there Zubaidah meets someone who will help her solve the mystery of her parentage. All these aspects make this novel so much more than a simple love story.In fact for me, the love story was actually my least favourite aspect of the novel. I cared either for Elijah or Rashid and was often annoyed by Zubaidah's behaviour. Had there not been of all the drama of the love triangle, I would have given this book 5 stars. I guess I just don't have the nerves and patience for this kind of thing anymore! Fortunately there are so many other elements that made the novel interesting. By the end I did not want it to finish! What this complex novel is really about is a person finding their own identity and place in this world. It is about being caught between two cultures. Finally Anam also addresses the topic of exploitation of workers in developing countries and how the exploitation is often overlooked, even supported in the West. Although it is the third book in the trilogy, I noticed that many of the reviewers had not read the first two books. While The Good Muslim is definitely a continuation of the story in A Golden Age and should be read in order, The Bones of Grace is really a story on to its own and could actually be read before the first two books.Tahmima Anam's writing is atmospheric, compelling and deeply moving.I highly recommend all her books!"}, {"userName": "Anato", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55272890-anato", "userReview": "Written like a letter, if a novel can ever be a letter, this book was stylistically very different from Anam's previous books. Sometimes that worked very well - especially the adversarial tone resulting from addressing the reader as \"you\". But at other times it didn't work so well - it was hard to tell how much time had passed, and more worryingly experiences and character growth got lost amid too many highbrow cultural references and overwrought language. A few details bothered me - Mo for example is not a believable nickname in Bangladesh. But it is common in the west, is this why the author chose it, to relate to that audience? A highlight of the book for me was Anwar's tale: the voice of a poorer Bangladeshi (or anyone from the global south) is so rarely heard in English writing. I also loved the way the author manipulates the English language to represent Anwar's speech - a lot of it will make sense if you speak Bangla yourself. I also loved to hate the main character - a rich brat, indecisive, insecure, and worried she isn't good enough for the white man - she's an amalgamation of actual people I know. The book does rely greatly on Bangla cinema style cliches of adoption, identity crisis and love at first sight - these are transparent plot devices the author uses to tell the story, and the story itself is worth reading (in this regard I do feel that comparisons to Rushdie are warranted). I could relate to a lot in the book so I'll fully admit that I'm positively biased."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1758411-lisa", "userReview": "I very nearly abandoned this book, more than once. Only the fact that I had been so impressed by its predecessor The Good Muslim stayed my hand. And now that I\u2019m finished it, all 407 pages of it, I remain unconvinced that reading it was a good investment of my time.The Bones of Grace is third in a trilogy, but in shifting the focus away from the post-war impact of the 1971 war of independence in Bangladesh, author Tahmina Anam seems to have lost her way and succumbed to writing an overwrought romance. The book begins with a tedious rehash of a Boston love affair between a half-hearted palaeontologist called Zubaida Haque (who is adopted) and an American called Elijah Strong. The narration is made even more irritating by the form chosen: almost all of this novel is Zubaida\u2019s \u2018older-and-wiser\u2019 letter to this Elijah and she keeps addressing him by name.Anyway, Zubaida goes off to a dig to find the fossils of a prehistoric whale (which she refers to incongruously as Diana). This whale, the Latin name of which now escapes me, is supposed to prove a back-to-front evolution, i.e. that there were creatures in the fossil record that were land animals which then adapted to the sea. This quest is, \u2013 yes, you guessed it \u2013 symbolic of Zubaida\u2019s fossicking around on a quest to find herself, with the post-war identity of Bangladesh thrown in for good measure.To read the rest of my review please visit https://anzlitlovers.com/2016/07/19/t..."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6334044-michelle", "userReview": "How did this happen? Ms. Anam's first novel \"A Golden Age\" was a surprise 5* read. I hadn't heard anything about the book or the author at that time, just picked it up at the library and was thrilled. I was so excited when her 2nd book \"The Good Muslim\" appeared on the scene. I didn't like it that much because I'm pretty disgusted by religious zealotry, most certainly when it is used as an excuse to control women, but gave it a 4* because, well it seemed unfair to rate it lower than that. But \"The Bones of Grace\"? The main character was the most privileged, spoiled, selfish woman who had so many pretensions that she was above the shallow, materialistic, pampered class that she was adopted into. The premise of the novel, a story written for a love lost by the protagonist's cowardice and indecision: yuck, maudlin, boring, who cares! By the last tenth of the book, I just wanted a bomb or plane crash to kill off this woman and end it, already.

The narrator, Zubaida, tells the tale of her thoughts and actions to Elijah, and you are carried along. You don't know Elijah's reactions, you only know what Zubaida thinks. I was a child in India when the war started in East Pakistan/Bangladesh. Much of Zubaida's life is influenced by the freedom war and the roles her parents played in it and its aftermath. I was easily caught up in all the Zubaida observed and felt, her failings and her strengths. I found myself a bit lost at the end of the book, especially since it wasn't the end of Zubaida's work or relationships or life.

Grace is studying the species of the walking whale, the fossil that provides a missing link in our evolution. Zubaida Haque falls in love with Elijah Strong, a man she meets in a darkened concert hall in Boston. Their connection is immediate and intense despite the many differences between them. Elijah belongs to an American family while Zubaids is the ado[ted daughter of a wealthy Bangladeshi family in Dhaka. She is forced to marry to marry her childhood best friend and settles into a traditional Bangladeshi life. Although her family is pleased with her conformity, Zubaida seethes with discontent. She moves to Chittagong to work as a documentary film about the infamous beeches where decommissioned ships are destroyed and their remains are scavenged by locals who depend on the goods for their survival.

I could not find any empathy for her, on the contrary, the more I advanced in the reading the more I despised her. It seemed to me that there were two styles confronting each other in this book.
