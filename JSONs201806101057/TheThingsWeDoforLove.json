It was the most beautiful touching story that I've read in a long time. This author has a unique insight into the human soul and she is able to gently guide her characters into a full and rich life in a way that is believable and heartfelt. Once I started this story I must admit that I just couldn't stop, it drew me in very quickly and I was delighted with the way it turned out. It's a story of human compassion and kindness and it tells the story of a family who truly love each other. Ange, the main character, finds out that what she has been looking for can come to her in a way she never imagined and as you go through the journey of Ange's self discovery you are forever changed. This is a beautiful love story, but it is not a romance. The love that Ange finds is that of a mother's love and she finds that it completes her and allows her to heal old hurts and fix past mistakes."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2189103-sharon", "userReview": "I don't know what part of this book hurt the most, the death of her child, her divorce, her fathers death, the teenager's broken life, the teen pregnancy, or everything else. This book tore my heart out and ripped it into tiny pieces. Then, slowly, Kristin Hannah put it back together. There was no typical happy ending, but it was just the ending I needed to read! A definite keeper. a book to be thought about often and remembered fondly."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1159557-heather", "userReview": "Truly an awful book, in part because it pretends to be a good one. It's one dimensional, flat writing, the kind that might be interesting in a writer's workshop but with characters who are not developed in any way, for a novel. Hannah is a terrible writer; her plot is boring; the characters don't feel real in any way (has she ever had a family that she might draw from?), and there is a use of overdone language, like, calling the parents, \"Mama\" and \"Papa,\" without real introduction. This book tries to invoke a warm feeling without doing the work of creating a warmth inside and within characters, giving them and the story life. This is the kind of book you buy at the airport, and then find yourself bored by it and the plane ride. My suggestion: don't waste your money or your time. Wish I hadn't."}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2558340-diana", "userReview": "I loved,loved,loved this book. It is a story of a couple who has tried for years to have a child and when they finally have one she doesn't live very long. They get a divorce and Angie moves back to the coast to be around her family and of course they are a big Italian family with a restaurant the is having money troubles so Angie steps in to help. She hires a young girl named Lauren who has practically raised herself as her mother is an alcoholic. Lauren gets pregnant and her Mother leaves and Angie steps in to help. It is a story of loss and family and life lessons. The ending was sad and happy and I sat and bawled like a baby when I was done.Kristin Hannah has always wrote books that bring out all kinds of feelings to make you laugh and cry.

I couldn't put it down and I think it's b/c I could really relate to the main character, Angie. I loved how Hannah captures the emotion of Angie, who is not able to conceive. It makes me wonder if the author experienced a miscarriage b/c she nailed it. The book focuses on the DeSario family, a large italian family with all sisters. Angie was the favorite of her father's growing up. She is the only one who moves out of their small town, becomes a marketing exec, and seems to have the perfect marriage, but is not able to have children. Her father labeled her early on the \"smart one\" and was resented by her sisters. She feels like a failure b/c she can't have a baby, which destroys her marriage. To pick up the pieces, she moves home and helps turn around the family restaurant. Lauren, is a senior in high school who has a crummy life. Her mother is an alcoholic and acts more like a child that Lauren has to care for. Her mother doesn't care about paying rent, sells her winter jacket for a pack of smokes, and treats Lauren terribly. She continually reminds Lauren that she was a mistake and had better not ruin her life. Lauren is smart, pretty, and works hard to pay the bills and get a scholarship for high school, as well as college. Her boyfriend is the QB, has a ton of money, and genuinely loves her. Lauren and Angie end up meeting and Angie employs her to work at the family restaurant. Lauren finally feels like she is part of a family. Angie becomes a real mother to her. Lauren has unprotected sex once and gets pregnant. Her mother slaps her across the face and leaves her to fend for herself. Lauren finally tells Angie and Angie takes her in. Lauren decides to give Angie her baby. Lots of trials and tribulations, but in the end, there is a very happy ending!"}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1360271-melanie", "userReview": "I had no expectations for this book. I simply picked it up at the grocery store, becuase I had nothing else to read and it sort of looked promising. I've tried to read Kristin Hannah before, so that should have been my clue not to try. The synopsis on the back sounded good, but it's pretty much the whole book. I don't like Hannah's style of writing. I find it very simple and lifeless, just like her characters. There were no surprises with this book. You can predict the plot from the first page. My advice is to simply read the back of the book and consider yourself finished with it."}, {"userName": "Gale", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70557732-gale", "userReview": "Light reading, good characters."}, {"userName": "Liza Wiemer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3152001-liza-wiemer", "userReview": "Enjoyed this very much!

It will make the reader smile, sad, laugh, long for someone you love/once loved, think, remember. This book shows the reader the humanness of people, even weakness and fragility. And also the things that tears people in half - love and forgiveness. Kristin Hannah will tell you through the story about life, \"'He loved to sit here and watch the ocean,' Mama said, leaning against her.  'We have to fix the stairs, Maria. That's what he said first thing every summer.'  'Did you hear me? Last night.... was hard.'  'We made a lot of changes every summer. This place never looked the same two years in a row.'  'I know. But--'  'It always started with one thing. Just fixing the stairs.'  'Just the stairs, huh?' Angie said, finally smiling.  'The longest journey begins with a single step and all that.' \" (P27)\"This too shall pass. Life has a way of going on, and you do your best and move with it. A broken heart heals. Like a every wound, there's a scar, a memory, but it fades.\" (P305)\"Some things in life, though, couldn't be gone in search of. They simply had to be waited for.\" (P341)\"'Everyone makes mistakes, honey. Growing up doesn't shield you from that.' \" (P354)\"Some choices no matter how smart and right, just couldn't be made.\" (P374)Pain and disappointment,\"'Believe me, family is overrated. Oh, they are fine till you screw up, but then, wham!, they break your heart. Don't you count on people, Lauren.' 'I just wish--' 'Don't. It'll only hurt you.' (P38)Grief,\"Grief was like that. It would sometimes feel fresh, no matter how long she lived. Some losses ran deep, and time moved too slowly in a lifetime to heal them completely.\" (P134)and love that takes so much strength, so much of ourselves, sacrifices and hard decisions,\"'Some things end, Mira.' 'Love shouldn't be one of those things.' \" (P171)\"Love can get us through hard times. It can also be our hard times.\" (P198)\"'Love bangs up a bit in this life, Lauren. But it doesn't go away.' \" (386)And my favourite,\"They'd lost their way because they'd thought their love wasn't enough. Now they knew better. Sometimes your heart got broken, but you just held on. That was all there was.\" (P378)It's a good read for people. It's a whole lot like standing on a beach watching the perfect sun set ever with the people you love the most. It will touch you. Hats off to this lady, Kristin Hannah. That gal knows what love and forgiveness is."}, {"userName": "Ns", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3040548-ns", "userReview": "The Things We Do For Love is an emotional journey into one woman's life-stifling heartache of needing to experience motherhood; of wanting and needing a child to love. It is a story about one of the strongest bonds between females, the bond shared between a mother and her daughter. Another young woman finds herself on the other end of the spectrum, a woman who has yet to experience a mother's nurture and love. Together these women find themselves linked in ways they couldn't imagine, discovering new meanings of love and the ability to receive and give it. There are moments that are heart-wrenching, tear-rendering, but also triumphant and heartwarming. Angie DeSaria Malone is a woman in limbo, a woman who feels incomplete. She craves a child and as the years passes without her wish materializing, the sense of loss becomes more acute. As a result her marriage also begins to crumble. She can no longer depend on the strength of their love, and it now becomes evident that the years have taken their toll on their marriage. The things that can sustain it no longer exist: care, love and understanding. After all is said, and unsaid, only unfilled dreams, a painful yearning and a resilient ache remain. With a divorce finalized, Angie retreats to her childhood hometown, a place overflowing with love from her family. She settles into running her family's restaurant business, against a family reluctant to change, all the while seeking peace within herself. There she meets Lauren Ribido and quickly a bond forms. Where Angie has known a life of boisterous family gatherings, laughter and love, Lauren has not. She has an alcoholic mother who cannot care for her, much less begin to love her. As her nature, Angie takes Lauren under her wings and begin a journey that will forever change both their lives. Angie is not unaware of her decisions, realizing the consequences that can occur but she is determined to help. As she mothers Lauren and as Lauren seeks her love, Angie is also faced with second chances. For love, for family and for motherhood. Three ingredients that should come standard but for Angie has always in the past been out of reach. A touching story that captures a woman's spirit so well, showing us how enduring it can be, and the things we do for love. I wish, though there was more focus on Angie's husband story, to see his side on the story. I also hope there's a future story for Lauren in store."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19924977-anne", "userReview": "Reminiscent of ANOTHER LITTLE PIECE OF MY HEART by Jane Green: woman desperately wants baby, comes to realize that pregnancy will never happen, baby miraculously comes into her life through an unexpected relationship. In the case of Angie Malone, what could have been opportunity to live out what she claimed to be true--that her life would turn out just fine even if there was never a baby--turned into another schmaltzy story line. I'm amazed by many things in this story--a woman and her daughter who run the kitchen of a fresh foods Italian restaurant by themselves, six nights a week AND still manage to run their households (and in the case of Mama Maria, run her three daughters' households as well)--but I was entirely floored that brilliant, talented Angie Malone could not see that adopting the baby of the teenager she had taken into her home would mean that she would have to say good-bye to the young mother. Unbelievable...because, remember, Angie accepted that her life would not include a baby...but also because many pages were written claiming that Angie had come to love young Lauren, vulnerable and wounded by her own mother.This book had a \"formula\" feel, but it also suffered from poor editing. The most glaring examples involve the repeat of a unique descriptive concerning the apartment building where Lauren lived * pg 84 \"Angie parked at the curb and stared up at the building. It reminded her of something out of a Roald Dahl novel, all decaying wood and blank, black spaces\" * pg 224 [from the POV of David Haynes' mother] \"They pulled up in front of the dilapidated building. In the moonlight, it looked like something out of a Roald Dahl novel, one of those a poor-pathetic-child-lives-here kind of places.\"I am still looking for the story that honestly portrays life fulfillment that does not include a baby."}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2171393-tina", "userReview": "I picked up this book by mistake. I thought the author was Kristin Higgins and didn\u2019t realize Kristin Hannah was a different author that writes a different genre. I didn\u2019t catch onto my mistake until about a third of the way thru the book. My tastes in books range from adventure and fun to witty and fantasy-like because when choosing to read a book, it is like a mini vacation from my life. Normally on vacations, I don\u2019t really like to visit sad, gut- wrenching life lessons, but I had already invested some of my time reading this story and it had already captured my attention so I continued on. When I turned the last page I was all emotional. I had cried thru the last chapter. Was the book good? Yes. Would I read it again? No, Wonderfully written and full of emotion, just not my type of book."}, {"userName": "Carol ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/909845-carol", "userReview": "A love story of families: between mother and daughter; between sisters; between a man and a woman; a boy and a girl; a girl and her brand new baby and a woman and the child she always wanted.

I enjoyed it very much even though I had trouble reading it through my tears in a few places. Good summer reading at the beach or on a rainy day at home. A great Italian family that comes together to help Angela through her divorce as she helps a down-on-her-luck teenager, Lauren, who comes to live with her and becomes her surrogate daughter and, in turn, helps Angela as much as Angela helps Lauren.

Yes, the story lines were cliche - a teenage pregnancy and a woman who would do anything for a child she can't have herself. But I thought the way the character's lives weaved together was beautiful. I cared deeply for all of the characters, and though the ending was predictable, it worked. I think it works because, despite the cliches, Hannah draws the reader in and makes the characters mean something.

She and her husband tried desperately to have a child; year after year, their perfectly decorated nursery remained empty. Finally, their marriage collapsed under the weight of lost dreams.After the divorce, Angie moved back to her hometown and rejoined her loud, loving, slightly crazy family. In West End, a place where life rises and falls in time with the tides, she will find the man who once again will open her heart to love . . . and meet the girl who will change Angie\u2019s life.Lauren Ribido lives in a rundown apartment in a bad part of town with a mother who cares more about her next drink than about her daughter. At seventeen, Lauren knows that her aspirations in life may never come to pass.From the moment they meet, Angie sees something special in Lauren. They form a quick connection, this woman who is desperate for a daughter and the girl who has never known a mother\u2019s love. When Lauren is abandoned by her mother, Angie doesn\u2019t hesitate to offer the girl a place to stay.
