It's August of 1888 and it certainly pays to keep a sharp eye out in regard to those who hover in eerie alleyways and darkened corners. But Esther is on a mission. Harry Turner has asked her to locate his wayward wife, Martha, who tends to drain the last drops of her glass at the White Hart. 'Tis not the company that holds Martha rigid there. 'Tis the drink.Locating Martha ornamenting the bar, Esther begs her friend to come home with her. Martha promises to be on her way. But evidently Martha's feet have stumbled in the wrong direction. Her body is found the next day on a landing in the George Buildings. She's been stabbed viciously by what appears to be a large weapon or bayonet followed by smaller cuts of a penknife. Whomever Martha encountered in those wee hours was an unbalanced individual filled with rage.....strange since Martha never had any enemies at all.The Metropolitan Police hold an inquest into Martha's death and Esther must attend since she was the last to see Martha alive. It is here that Esther comes eye to eye with Constable Jack Enright. It is here that the storyline ratchets up as more female bodies are found in Whitechapel. Esther feels compelled to assist Jack in his investigation. She wants nothing more than justice for Martha. They work well together until they have a falling out which will put them at great odds.David Field has spun his story in a completely different direction in regard to the ol' Jack the Ripper saga. It's clever and filled with detailed police investigative jargon. Scotland Yard will get a foothold here as well alongside the duo of Esther and Jack. \"Never form a firm opinion too early in a case and then try to make the evidence fit your theory.\" Field's character of Esther is refreshing with emphasis upon her analytical skills and her street smarts from having to fend for herself after her parents' death. He even incorporates timely anti-Semitic riots in which factories are burned and neighbors eye neighbors with disdain. A tough time to make it in London, especially if you are a woman and Jewish.The Gaslight Stalker is the first book in this series. (I've already ordered the other two.) Smart, fast-paced, and loaded with street banter that takes you on site of the Ripper.....and so much more. Well worth a stroll past common lodging houses and the snapping twist of a quick glance over your shoulder....just in case."}, {"userName": "BAM The Bibliomaniac ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6595648-bam-the-bibliomaniac", "userReview": "Many thanks to Sapere Books for the free copy of this book in exchange for my unbiased review.Who doesn't love a take on a Jack the Ripper tale?

We follow two plot lines: the investigation and the relationship. I enjoyed them both.

Later never comes as Martha is found stabbed to death in a neighbouring building. As one of the last people to see Martha alive the police interview her and in the course of this she meets PC Jack Enright with whom she starts a relationship and helps with his investigation as more bodies are discovered.I thoroughly enjoyed The Gaslight Stalker which has a very readable style and an ingenious solution to the unsolved identity of Jack the Ripper. I like the mixture of fact and fiction although sometimes it is difficult to differentiate, not being a Ripper specialist, but I can only see this as a positive as they slot together seamlessly.This not a challenging read, in fact it could almost be described as cozy with the romance between Jack and Esther, but it is exciting as the intrepid duo try to work out what is happening. Life in the east end of London was not comfortable at that time and while Mr Field does describe some poor conditions and the seamier side of life I didn't get the visceral feel of the struggle to survive as it's all a bit remote.I imagine that there will be more novels about Jack and Esther to come as their exploits are a pleasant way to pass a few hours. I'll be interested to see if Mr Field continues in faction vein or if he will move to straight fiction.The Gaslight Stalker is a good read which I have no hesitation in recommending."}, {"userName": "Veronica \u2b50\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6716390-veronica", "userReview": "The Gaslight Stalker is author David Field\u2019s take on the Jack the Ripper case, crossing fact and fiction to give the reader an eerie tale set in the back alleys and dingy pubs of 1880\u2019s London.The Gaslight Stalker is the first in a series featuring Esther Jacobs and Jack Enright.In book one the Ripper is on the loose and a friend of Esther\u2019s is murdered.

David Field has done a fantastic job in writing this book, and his descriptions were so good that I could picture myself back in the eighteen hundreds, on the streets of London. I also quite liked the characters.Esther Jacobs is horrified when her friend and neighbour Martha, is brutally killed one night when they had been out together. Martha was certainly known for drinking too much and being a lady of the night before she got married, however not going home with Esther wasn\u2019t certainly a mistake. After seeing Martha\u2019s body, Detective Sergeant Jack Enright knows he\u2019s looking for a very violent killer, especially with how many times she has been stabbed. Jack interviews Esther, as she was one of the last people to see Martha alive. Esther didn\u2019t get out much as she worked as a seamstress from her room, so she\u2019s quite surprised at the chemistry her and Jack have when they first meet each other. When a second woman is killed in the same manner as Martha, Scotland Yard are quick to step in and take over the investigation. However, this isn\u2019t going to stop Jack and Martha in continuing their own investigation, as it certainly doesn\u2019t look like this killer is going to stop anytime soon.

Having not read any of the Authors books before, I had no expectations of how the book would read. I am generally not over fond of historical stories but found this one to be so enthralling that I had to read it in one go. The world carried on around me, without me participating in it.I would like to say that the author has obviously done his historical research and I like that these facts have been included in the book to balance the fiction.It is written to include similar murders around the time of Jack the Ripper and I like the spell that is woven in and around Spittalfields and surrounding areas. The author is so good at describing the smells, the sights and characters that you can imagine yourself standing in the middle of it all and looking around as if you are actually there.I like all the characters in this book and especially the main two Characters Jack and Esther and the way that Esther is not necessarily portrayed as a silly woman involving herself in mens stuff, which was something that was certainly prevalent in that era. How she can overcome any considered failings and still be thought quite highly of.The romance in the book is quaint and demure and it is lovely to see how it progresses and overcomes the problems that they encountered. The Gaslight Stalker is the first crime thriller in an exciting new historical series, I cannot wait for the next in the series, as the finishing of the book leaves you wanting more of the tale.I would highly recommend this book and any subsequent in the series to those who love any of the following genres romance, mystery, thriller, suspense and crime."}, {"userName": "Graham McGhie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13335887-graham-mcghie", "userReview": "A highly readable novel with an original theory on the identity of Jack the Ripper:David Field presents the reader with an alternative solution to the Jack the Ripper murders in this highly readable novel featuring Esther Jacobs and Jack Enright. Esther, of good family but fallen on hard times, works as a seamstress in the East End of London and befriends Martha , the first of the Ripper's victims. Or was she? Esther helps the police with their enquiries and meets Jack Enright an attractive Metropolitan Police man. Esther would have made an excellent detective had she been born a man. Remember that this is the 1880's.David Field weaves his fictional account with dexterity around the actual facts known about the Ripper murders and the Police Investigation. And I would stress from my own reading of the Ripper murders that David Field gets his facts right. We get to meet Abberline, the Scotland Yard detective who led the enquiry. The characterisation works reasonably well and Field succeeds in bringing the major characters to life. I did think that Esther would have acquired more of a Cockney way of speaking given the length of time she had lived in Whitechapel but there again maybe not. The solution posed is probably as good as any theories put forward to date. Read the book and see what you think. The novel, which is relatively short, successfully captures the atmosphere of 1880's London. A promising start to what is intended as a series of novels featuring Esther and Jack Enright.

The Gaslight Killer is inspired by Jack the Ripper's reign of terror on the streets of Whitechapel and Ripperologists will relish Field's interpretation of events. He cleverly uses existing speculation and mythology to help our heroes catch a killer. The book gives us a good picture of the seedy underbelly of London from the gin-soaked prostitutes to their lascivious punters and the dangers that lurk around every corner. At the eviscerated heart of the story is a well placed blossoming romance between a young Jewish seamstress, Esther Jacobs and the dashing Constable Jack Enright, who are both involved in the pursuit of the devilish killer who lurks in the shadows. Their innocent courtship is undoubtedly a refreshing contrast to the loose nature of the ladies of the night. Modern fiction fans will find this old-fashioned romance an enchanting contrast to the bed-hopping in contemporary novels. Field also brings in concepts of race, class and gender alongside the mystery plot and this becomes as much of a focus as the search for Jack. For a Ripper novel Field deals with the subject matter in quite a removed way. He doesn't get bogged down in grizzly details but drips us enough information to get the bloody picture before moving on in a very British way. Jacobs and Enright's crime-fighting adventures are set to continue in further books and are sure to pick up plenty of historical crime fiction fans."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11042558-pam", "userReview": "I have always been interested in \"Jack the Ripper\" and found this book an enjoyable take on a well known story, with Esther and Jack bringing light to an otherwise dark interlude."}, {"userName": "Elisa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24746698-elisa", "userReview": "I started this novel with trepidation: we know that Jack the Ripper was never caught so how is The Gaslight Stalker going to generate any suspense? I was pleasantly surprised by the original and unexpected explanation to this real-life crime spree. The plot mixes actual historical data with fictional details and it's done so well that it's hard to tell the difference. Maybe it won't fool an expert, but for the casual \"ripperologist\" it feels like rewriting history. But this true crime episode is made relatable thanks to Esther and Jack. She is a poor seamstress who lives in the area where women are being brutally and famously murdered. Esther is educated and hard-working, but has fallen on hard times. Jack is a rookie cop trying to learn the ropes. When they meet, sparks fly. Even if I enjoyed their banter this was my least favorite part, only because I'm not into romantic subplots, but many readers will enjoy the way the love story lightens the tone. My favorite part is the ambiance. I wouldn't want to live or even visit that London, but reading about the stench and the fog and the dirt paints a vivid picture of the cesspool that created a monster.

It's an odd mix of a story, shifting from very minute details of the killings by Britain's most famous murderer, Jack The Ripper, to a romance between Esther Jacobs, a young Jewish seamstress living in genteel poverty and Jack Enright, a policeman slightly younger than Esther who meets her during his inquiries into what was thought to be the first of the Ripper murders. For some reason (it is the 1880's) Esther seems to think that Jack being a couple of years younger than her is important and obviously suffers from low self-esteem. The latter leads to all manner of complications in their courtship, not least a disastrous confrontation between Esther and Jack's mother, Constance.Earlier in the story, Esther becomes involved in the Ripper investigation at the behest of his boss, Reid who battles with Jack's uncle Percy, himself a senior police officer involved in the case. But Esther also seems intent on having the police arrest a back street abortionist named Pearly Poll - and acquaintance of Martha Tabram, the Ripper's alleged first victim who was also a friend of Esther.The coroner's inquiries into each of the murders features heavily in the story and would be of interest to anyone who has limited knowledge of the story of Jack The Ripper, but I found these to be a bit repetitive, slowing the action down. Similarly with details of the arguments between the many senior police officers involved with the case.The atmosphere of late Victorian London is well captured by the author, especially the city's poorest areas, and the scenes where Esther and others visit some down-at-heel pubs and boarding houses seem authentic enough, but I found the language, especially that of London's low life, a bit stilted, jarring with the bulk of the narrative. That said, the book is a very well researched account of the Ripper murders.Eventually, the two parts of the story collide as Esther is put in great danger and the story provides yet another shocking alternative to the identity of Jack The Ripper.

It merges fact and fiction, real people and new characters and, basically, puts a new spin on the gruesome murders. I have read several non-fiction books on the subject, and indeed been on a Ripper Tour in Whitechapel, as well as having read a few other fiction versions of the goings on and I found that the author has done a very good job here in his weaving of fiction through the facts as we know them.Esther is a seamstress. She hasn't had the best of starts in life, losing her parents in a nasty accident but she has managed to keep her head above water with her dressmaking and tailoring skills. She is out one night seeking out Martha, a friend who is down on her luck,to try and persuade her to come home to her husband. She finds her but is unable to get her to come with. Next morning, her friend is found brutally murdered and Esther is called as a witness. In the course of the case, Esther meets a young police detective, Jack Enright, and the two of them team up, both romantically and professionally as they start their own investigations of what happened to Martha. As more people die, Esther, Jack and the other police try and get to the bottom of things but it is Esther's own investigative skills that prove instrumental in finding clues to the perpetrator. But can they prove who killed the women, and why?I do love a good Ripper story. Ever since I visited London and stayed in Whitechapel I have been interested in the whole Ripper world. And it is a world, believe me! There are so many theories about who and why and this book delivers a very interesting alternative version that, in itself, was quite credible. I loved the way that the fictional elements were seamlessly woven around what we know as fact. The victims, the investigating police, the main players are all here, as well as the world in which the action all happens. We even had a bit of romance thrown in for good measure which also fitted in well with the ambience of what was happening and was in keeping with the time in which the book was set.It's not a long book but it definitely packed a punch. There was enough description to well set the scene for the time and place but not too much to be distracting. The book flowed well apart from a few disjointed scene changes mid chapter. The characterisation was also good. The real characters were well described to be authentic and the fictional ones fitted in well with them as well as being congruent with time and place. The depictions of the murders was graphic enough to illustrate the heinous nature of the crimes but not too much to be overly gory for effect.The ending, where we found out the identity of the Ripper was also well done. I won't spoil things but it was quite refreshing and definitely a new spin on the whodunnit list! All in all, a very good read that kept my attention nicely throughout and left me satisfied at its conclusion. I see that it is a series opener and I would definitely be interested in seeing where the author takes Esther and Jack next time.

After Esther returns home, Martha's dead body is found in the stairwell of a lodging house in Whitechapel, a very dangerous place to be after dark in 1888. Esther meets Constable Jack Enright at the inquest for Martha's death. They start spending time together to investigate Martha's death and get to know each other better and find surprising connections between the murder of Esther's friend and other grisly murders in the area.It took me a couple chapter to get into this story and I was surprised at the harsher language in the beginning of a \"Victorian\" mystery. However, I was won over by the rapport between Esther and Jack as they get to know each other. Esther goes a little overboard in her reaction to something that occurs during a visit to Jack's mother, but overall, I like the character and was rooting for her and Jack.I was interested to see Esther, Jack, and Jack's Uncle Percy, a Scotland Yard detective, make progress in their investigation, which reveals that the murder seems to have been committed by the notorious \"Jack the Ripper\". I'm not knowledgeable about the subject, but it's obvious author David Field has done extensive research. The author does a good job of communicating the horrific nature of the murders, without being too gory in the descriptions. When all is revealed, I found the identity of the Ripper to be intriguing and unique. This novel will appeal to fans of Anne Perry.

Though the book turned to be a bit different than what I had expected when I read the synopsis, but still I enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend this book to all mystery lovers.I loved Esther's character. She is the kind of woman I love reading about, she is strong, brave and someone who is ready to give a piece of her mind to anyone who dared to think lowly of her because of her job as seamstress, or the place she lived in. Esther was very courageous and was not at all afraid to go to dangerous places or to talk to dangerous people in her quest to find out who the murderer was. I also liked Jack's character, even though I had expected more action and more detective work from him, given the synopsis, and the fact that the series is named as Esther and Jack Enright Mysteries. I just hope that in the coming books of the series, I would get see more action and more involvement in the case from Jack.The Gaslight Stalker completely gripped from the time the first murder was committed and with each coming page I became more and more engrossed in the story. I was not able to put down this book, until the very last page was turned. I was very shocked when the murderer was revealed. I had not expected this person to be the one murdering people. This twist was just the best part of the novel.I enjoyed the romance between Jack and Esther and the romance didn't, even for once, overshadow the mystery plot, which was very good.\nFinal words\nIf you are looking for a mystery novel with a sprinkle of romance, set in Victorian London then you should immediately click on the buy links and get yourself a copy of The Gaslight Stalker ."}, {"userName": "Jan", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11411702-jan", "userReview": "Excellent! Obviously much care was given to research of policing and coroner's inquest in the late 1880s. The plot holds the reader's interest with suspense as the murders pile up, and there is the sideline romance as well. The characters are interesting and well drawn as is the life and atmosphere of the target area. I'm glad that I didn't know prior to reading that it was a version of the Whitechapel murders because that allowed me to enjoy without any preconceived notions. Well worth the price even though I got it on sale!"}, {"userName": "Deborah Meldrum", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63264201-deborah-meldrum", "userReview": "An interesting take on the Ripper murdersAn interesting take on the Ripper murders.
