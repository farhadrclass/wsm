I wanted to like this so much more as it is a new author and the blurb sounded like it would be a fairly decent story; however I have to say I was disappointed, the blurb didn't come through with it's promise - confrontation of pasts, a friendship that changes their lives, breaking points....not from where I was reading. Don't get me wrong it was nice to read a nice story about nice friendships and nice relationships and nice husbands but where were the problems we were promised? They all nicely disappeared with no real heartache, everything worked out just...well, nicely.I truly hate not liking books and it's not really that I didn't like it, I certainly didn't hate it but it just didn't live up to its promise; there could have been much more depth to the characters and story, all the premises were there but they just petered out.....and it's not that I dislike happy endings, I'm a sucker for them, but usually there is a lot of heartache and trouble before the happy ending. Nothing, not Jenny's mum appearing or the potential affair or the returning ex or the troublesome teens were dealt with with anything like verve or interest.Disappointing but I'd give her a second chance."}, {"userName": "Cora \u2615 Tea Party Princess", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4166936-cora-tea-party-princess", "userReview": "A delightful and easy read.Despite it taking me only a few hours to read, I really felt for each of the characters.

I wasn't that impressed by the writing, and thought a lot of the dialogue was distinctly clunky. I thought she squandered an opportunity by choosing to write Jenny - by far the least interesting character - in the first person, while telling the stories of the far more interesting Maggie and Alison in the 3rd. Some of the characters weren't rounded at all - Alison's husband Pete, the gay friend with the cafe, Jenny's disabled brother Chris, sulky green gardener Owen - and I thought some of the plot twists were either telegraphed or so ridiculous as to be totally unbelievable. A feel good read, but sometimes that's just not enough."}, {"userName": "Megan Readinginthesunshine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11829532-megan-readinginthesunshine", "userReview": "I was very much looking forward to reading this, as not only did it sound fascinating, but as you all know, I LOVE debut novels! I absolutely love discovering new authors, so after a few recommendations to read this book (thank you!) I settled down on an afternoon to start this.This is a beautifully written novel that combines the lives of three women after they all fall in love with the same vintage tea set. In the end, they decide to share it, and this forms a friendship between them. The novel then follows the lives of Jenny, Maggie and Alison, as they take turns using the tea set, exploring careers, relationships and the importance of friendship.I LOVED The Vintage Teacup Club! I could not put it down and I enjoyed opening the pages and becoming lost in the story for hours at a time. I finished the book in a few sittings, it was such a wonderful story that flowed so easily and before I knew it I was half-way through the book!The three main characters were fantastically written! I especially loved that the women were different from each other, they had separate goals, were at different points in their lives and had many different experiences of life. The contrasts worked beautifully and added a lot of different layers and depth tot the relationships they formed with each other. I loved how the bond between the three women grew and strengthened as time went on.The descriptions in the book are great, I could picture the scenes clearly in my mind and the narrative made the story very enjoyable and easy to read. I especially loved the idea of the vintage tea set and after finishing this book, I\u2019m very keen to purchase s a set for myself!The Vintage Teacup Club is a delightful, book that will warm your heart. It is a beautiful story exploring the wonders of friendship and family. This book is perfect for sitting down and reading with a cup of tea (and imagining that you\u2019re drinking from a vintage tea set rather than your usual cup)!

While on the hunt for vintage cups at a local car boot sale, Jenny spots the perfect tea set and sets her heart on it. Florist Maggie is helping to organise a client's wedding and is also trying to track down vintage teacups as part of her floral display. She spots the tea set at the same time as Jenny and Alison. Alison has always been good at sewing and crafts and has set up her own business, selling her handcrafted items. She's on the lookout for vintage teacups to make into candles so when she spots the tea set at the car boot sale, she wants it as much as the other women. With three women and only one tea set, they make a compromise. They will buy the set together and take turns using it - first Jenny for her wedding, then Maggie for her floral displays and finally Alison for her candles. Through the vintage tea set, Jenny, Maggie and Alison strike up a friendship and help each other through some difficult times in their lives. The Vintage Teacup Club is a lovely tale of friendship, bringing together the three women who become closer as they join forces to hunt down more teacups. My favourite storyline was Maggie's and while I enjoyed the whole book, I found myself looking forward to her chapters the most. I loved the setting of The Vintage Teacup Club and would love to visit the cafe, Blitz Spirit, for tea and cake."}, {"userName": "Maggie Boyd", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3730838-maggie-boyd", "userReview": "Jenny is planning the perfect wedding to Dan and at the reception each guest will be served their tea in a delicate, beautiful vintage china cup.

When all three spot the perfect tea set at flea market stall they come to an unlikely bargain: they will share all their finds, sharing the costs as well. The teacups will be used in Jenny's wedding, then Maggie's and finally Alison will make candles out of them. This is a sweet story about the power of friendship and what makes a romance last.

Sounds quite perfect, doesn't it? That is exactly what reading The Vintage Teacup Club feels like. With delightful descriptions of gorgeous antique tea sets (very much like the one gracing the stunning cover) and wonderful characters the book is sweet, cute and very inviting, just like a delicious cup of tea after a long working day. In her debut novel Vanessa Greene uses an original take on the \"club\" sub-genre in women's literature. The story centres around three characters, all looking for vintage teacups. And as all three reach out for the same set at the start of the novel a deal is made and an unexpected friendship is born.There are many lines by Greene that are beautiful but this one in particular perfectly depicts what the novel is all about: \"To new friends, a port in the storm.\"While all three characters get nearly equal exposure, it is Jenny who comes across as the main protagonist as hers is the one told from the first perspective. About to get married to her fianc\u00e9 Dan, Jenny is looking for vintage tea cups to grace the tables on her wedding day. While at the start of the book it looks like her life is pretty much picture perfect, trouble brews when someone from her past suddenly makes a re-appearance. Alison is a wife and mum of two rebellious teenage girls. Her husband Pete lost his job and it's up to her to supplement their income with her craft works. One of the more popular items she makes are candles in a tea cup, which is of course the very reason she strolls through antique fairs searching for her next stash of cups. Maggie owns flower shop \"Bluebelle du Jour\" and is currently working on the flower arrangements for an Alice in Wonderland inspired wedding. She believes that a collection of vintage tea sets would be perfect for the Mad Hatter's Tea Party aspect of the celebrations. That is, if she can reason with landscaper Owen, who's a good friend of the groom and helping out as a favour to the bridal party, as with his lack of wedding planning experience he grates on Maggie's nerves. All three characters are well thought out and interesting from a reader's point of view. And as they span several generations there is something relatable to be found for everyone. In fact, by the end of the novel I felt I had gained three unexpected friends myself, whom I'd love to regularly catch up with over a cup of tea and a scone, generously covered in clotted cream and homemade strawberry jam.As Jenny reflects upon their friendship near the end of the novel, she pretty much describes exactly what I was feeling when reading the book: \"As I watched Ali and Maggie talking, I thought back to the start of the Summer and the moment we'd met, how little we'd known each other then. Step by step we'd let each other in, and now it was hard to imagine that we hadn't always been there for each other. These women were both so strong, had bounced back from life's knocks and come out better for it. But then I suppose, somehow, with their help, I had done the same.\"The only \"complaint\" I have about the The Vintage Teacup Club is that it's a fairly quick read. At times I tried to slow my regular reading pace down in an attempt to delay the inevitable, the final pages. Unfortunately, despite my efforts, it was still over too soon. However, the novel was a delightful read while it lasted and it has left me with some fantastic inspirational ideas (such as forming a friendship club around vintage teacups, or collecting them for my own wedding\u2026 one day)."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4341611-heather", "userReview": "It took about 100 pages before I actually cared about the characters. There\u2019s way too much backstory in those pages. The second third of the book was well paced and I was invested on the lives of the characters. The last third was a can\u2019t put down page turner that made me feel like a member of The Vintage Teacup Club. The novel is told from the eyes of three strangers who bond over a tea set. It\u2019s a bit weird that Jenny\u2019s chapters are in first person POV while the others are in third person POV."}, {"userName": "Lucinda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6463881-lucinda", "userReview": "Classic chick-lit that is quintessentially British, so elegant and delightful that makes for an absorbing read. Are you drinking tea with a fine bone china painted teacup? If you are not then you should be, for The Vintage Teacup Club is a spectacular and truly delightful read that I aim to now re-read. This brilliant debut novel by Vanessa Greene combines the love of three women who meet by chance and then from firm friendships. Jenny (first person narrator) visits a car boot sale in Charlesworth, an old market town in Sussex, comes across a delicate and beautiful vintage teaset. Then as if it is fate two other women also appear who want the same teaset, and so they make the compromise of sharing it between themselves; which is the great catalyst for change. Each character\u2019s story then unfolds as you begin to find out more about their lives, the trials and tribulations that they are presented with making for an engrossing and heartwarming tale that is completely captivating from the very beginning. Jenny is looking forward to her forthcoming marriage to Dan, Maggie the independent career woman is surging ahead after her disappointing first marriage and Alison appears to be at a quick glance someone who is happily married with two delightful daughters. However things are never as they seem as when Jenny is thrown suddenly by an unexpected encounter with a woman from the past, things turn topsy turvey and the drama thus unfolds before your very eyes. This is a story about three very distinctive characters of varying ages that have many contrasting experiences within life, and yet are connected in the most curious and unexpected way. Interesting dimensions are brought into each individual\u2019s relationships as they juxtapose one another with their mannerisms, thoughts and actions and singular traits (that I feel is also connected to their age). The strong, supportive bond that is created between the three characters is a joy to encounter and especially when the age barrier is broken, professing that it is of no consequence in a lasting friendship. As you explore each character in detail you at times feel as if you are holding up a mirror to yourself, as the writing is quite poignant and truth-drawing. I was able to connect with each individual character and relate and empathize with them, as I read about their lives and tensions that are designed to push them to breaking point. Dealing with friendships and families, relationships and careers, highs and lows and ups and downs The Vintage Teacup is such heartwarming, beautifully un-clandestine so overt storytelling at its very best. This wonderful book is an absolute treasure, a jewel amongst its genre and a captivating read that perfectly depicts what the novel is all about; those strong bonds of friendship that are so important within all our lives. I am so impressed by Vanessa Green whose stunning, beautiful book has exceeded and surpassed all of my predispositions towards this genre and which is just so astonishing for a first novel. I cannot enthuse enough about this magnificent book that I strongly urge you to read, and which has found a very special place right at the top of my bookshelf."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7304285-amanda", "userReview": "This is one of my favourite \u2018chick lit\u2019 reads so far this year and an excellent debut from Vanessa Greene.The story centres around three characters Jenny, Maggie and Alison who meet at a car boot sale as they hunt for vintage teacups to add to their collections and spot the same set at the same time. I loved that Vanessa Greene gave an instant introduction to the three very different characters, their \u2018looks\u2019 and personalities. Jenny is young and fresh; excited about her upcoming wedding and searching for the teacups to be the perfect centrepieces at her vintage school hall reception; Maggie, independent, poised and determined is the owner of the wonderfully named flower shop Bluebelle du Jour and needs the teacups for a \u2018celebrity\u2019 wedding that she\u2019s working on for a local model which could be her stepping stone to expanding her business and creative mum of two, Alison plans to use the teacups to make candles to sell as part of her growing craft business. The three women soon realise that they can help each other out and The Vintage Teacup Club is formed.I thought the three lead characters were all lovely and immediately warmed to each of them. There is plenty to identify with in Maggie, Jenny and Alison and their lives and I think that this is a book that will appeal to a wide range of readers. This is very much a story about relationships and coupled with their overarching teacup \u2018projects\u2019 each woman has significant issues to deal with in her personal life too which makes The Vintage Teacup Club an absorbing read. The book examines relationships with parents, partners and friends but despite covering familiar ground, it never felt clich\u00e9d and I thought there were some excellent twists to the story as Alison\u2019s oldest daughter begins to rebel, Jenny\u2019s estranged mother contacts her and a past love makes Maggie reconsider her life.There is also a lovely cast of supporting characters in The Vintage Teacup Club. I loved Ruby and Derek, the elderly couple that the girls meet on their teacup search and I thought their story was so romantic. I was also impressed that with one exception, the male characters in the book were as lovely as the female ones \u2013 very refreshing! The romance element to the story is nicely woven into the plot and although this is actually a lovely romantic read, it doesn\u2019t overwhelm the story of three strong women getting on with their lives and careers.As you can probably tell, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and was sad when it ended. The Vintage Teacup Club is classic, warm British chick lit at its best and a wonderful debut. I can\u2019t wait to read more from Vanessa Greene and I very much hope that we get to catch up with Jenny, Maggie and Alison again in the future too.

The one is \u0430 blonde, the other is a brunette and the third is (what a surprise!) a redhead, their predictable and absolutely nondescript partners, the inevitable gay friend, the missing mother, the annoying teenager and a few cats and dogs (some of which only appear just to be immediately forgotten afterwards)\u2026 So far, so good. To be honest, I wouldn\u2019t have made the hard effort to continue reading, if I didn\u2019t have to, but I must admit that I am glad I did, because now I almost understand why Greene considered it a good idea to continue writing after this first attempt.Despite the clumsy beginning, which hardly promises any development at all, things do happen in the end, however predictable some of them might be. Furthermore, this novel also confirmed my high doubts that the author has a non-imaginary editor, bearing in mind all the factual mistakes I found in the book, much like in The Seafront Tearooms (wrong names appear now and then, words missing, etc.). Nevertheless, compared to the latter, I must admit that this one is definitely more fun (I'm still reading it).Anyway, my original intention was to write a positive review, and I really hope that this one will do :)***Well, OK, I read it.

Jenny is our first person narrator; she is browsing at a car boot sale in Charlesworth, an old market town in Sussex, and we share her delight when she happens upon precisely the items she has been searching for, a vintage teaset. Just at that moment, two other women swoop in who are equally as interested in the very same items. The three women decide to share the teaset, each making use of it in turn for their own special purposes, and from this unique beginning, their stories unfold. Jenny is looking forward to her forthcoming marriage to Dan. As her plans move forwards, she is thrown by the sudden unexpected contact from a woman who has played no part in her life for many years, and she worries that her happiness could be damaged. Maggie is a strong, independent career woman, forging ahead after the disappointment of her failed marriage and Alison appears at first sight to be a happily married woman with two daughters, but things are never as straightforward as they might seem, for any of them. One of the aspects I liked about the main characters in this novel is that the women are not all the same age, and they have different experiences of life. This brings an interesting dimension to their relationships with each other, across the generations. It was lovely to read how such a strong, supportive bond develops between the friends, and this friendship that forms isn\u2019t affected by this difference in their ages, for example when they share exciting news with each other; \u2018A twenty-year age gap made no difference to our levels of girlish excitement.\u2019A favourite part of the narrative for me involves the history of the teaset and culminates with a perceptive comment which is made about life and love, how \u2018As you get older you see that what you thought were little things, why they were really the big things all along.\u2019This is a sparkling debut novel. I really enjoyed reading it. It is an easy, engaging read with likeable characters, between whom a lovely, believable and supportive friendship grows. The characters develop and the women support and encourage each other to follow their dreams and be successful and happy. When times are tough and romance, family or careers are getting them down, they are there for each other to share the pain, and they celebrate this: \u2018To new friends, a port in the storm.\u2019 Vanessa Greene paints a lovely portrait of female friendship across the generations.

Quite the opposite I thought it was so awful and pointless I just wanted to get it done so I could start on something else. I used to think just about anyone could write a half decent chick lit book. Having read quite a few I have even be tempted to try one myself. I think this book really shows us that there is a craft to it and this book was not well crafted at all. It was really horrible and here's why:1) There was no definitive story - it was all over the place. What story there was was truly awful. These ladies meet out of the blue and decide to be friends because they all like teacups? Are you serious. They barely say a word to each other and next thing they are just \"popping\" around to each other's houses. How sad and lonely can you be. Is it just me or does a friendship take time to grow? It was all a bit strange and not realistic2) The characters were all the same. I had to keep referring to the blurb to remind myself who was who. They were all copies of each other (pretty, man troubles. creative in some way, floozies). I would have liked to have seen an accountant or lawyer thrown into the mix. You felt like you could have always been reading about the same person and they all seemed liked idiots to me.3) The whole story and all the little details were so unrealistic - Jenny is planning her dream wedding. She has spent months and years planning it and yet they don't address dress shopping until just a few weeks before. That is not a realistic situation. Four strange woman that want one teaset and they just decide to share it? Could that really happen? I love teasets but the internet is loaded with them, no sharing would be necessary.One other detail I forgot to almost mention- one of the woman (what's her face) finds an address on the teaset box and shows up at a strange person's house. She reasoned they owned the teaset first so it wouldn't be weird at all. Of course instead of looking at her like she is insane or calling the police (as you would in real life) they invite her in for tea. (insert eye roll here). Lonely much?You might think me a little cynical but I like to imagine book happening in my mind. In what universe would any of these things ever happen?Read it if you want but there are about 1000 other chick lit books out there more worth your time. Think Sophie Kinsella (mostly) and Jane Green."}, {"userName": "Stina", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4338068-stina", "userReview": "Book #6 for 2016PopSugar Challenge Categories:- A book set in Europe- A book with a blue cover- A book that takes place on an island- A book that takes place during summerPersonal Challenge Category:- A book with multiple POV charactersThis was probably more of a 2.5-star read for me, but it was a nice, pleasant read, so I'll round up. I'm tempted to say that this is not the sort of thing I'd have picked up if it hadn't been a book club selection, but that's not really the case. I would have found the premise -- three women who are strangers until a vintage tea set brings them together -- intriguing enough. And I would have been expecting something more chick-lit-ish than my usual fare of murder mysteries and sci-fi adventures. Alas, I would have been expecting something more along the lines of Maeve Binchy, which is probably where my disappointment lies.Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad book, and I didn't dislike it. It is a very nice book. I just didn't feel properly engaged by the characters or their stories, which held very few surprises for me. I found some scenes touching, but nothing really grabbed my emotions and twisted them in knots. (For contrast, I distinctly remember having a meltdown while reading Tara Road.) I also found it mildly irritating that every little thing, every thought going through anybody's head, was fully explained to me. I suppose some readers like that. I would much rather have to work a little bit and have the thrill of an a-ha moment later on.One thing that was odd about this book was that there were three POV characters, but only one (Jenny) was presented in the first person. The others were in a close third person. So I suppose the author identifies herself more closely with Jenny, but it still seems an odd stylistic choice. I also thought the whole Ruby-and-Derek subplot seemed kind of shoe-horned in there. But I can't say any of this really detracted from the book.If you're a fan of this kind of story and are in the mood for something light and quick, you might want to give this a try. If you're looking for a substantial read with some deeper meaning to it, though, you should keep looking."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12647941-rebecca", "userReview": "This book was absolutely lovely. If I had to choose one word to describe it, that would be it. \"Lovely\". Three women, three separate lives, but a slight obsession with collecting vintage teacups is what has brought these ladies together, and it is marvellous!The story begins at a car-boot sale. Jenny spots the teacups first. Then Maggie, followed closely by Alison..As the three women eyeball each other, they come to realise that there is a way that all three of them can get what they need out of the teacups, without starting a full-blown brawl in the middle of a muddy field. Jenny is not far away from marrying her partner, Dan. With wedding preparations under way, her life is a little bit hectic at the moment. But what she really wants at her wedding, is teacups, and lots of them, just for that little vintage touch. Maggie runs her own flower shop, creating bright, floral creations for numerous events, such as birthdays, funerals, weddings etc. But the wedding she's about to start designing for is much more demanding than her usual one, and with a pesky, arrogant landscape artist in on the job two, it's proving to be more difficult than she first perceived. And Alison has some troubles going on in her life too. With her two daughters, Sophie and Holly, and adoring husband, Pete, she seems to have it all. With her teenage daughter Sophie waltzing off to forbidden parties at every given chance, Alison is finding it rather pushing to keep it all together. As these three women are brought together, so are their lives. An absolutely fantastic read, took me a while as I read it over Christmas, but it was marvellous, and I would gladly read it again! :)"}, {"userName": "Iveta Marinopolska", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12908564-iveta-marinopolska", "userReview": "This cup of tea had waaaay too much sugar in it.Not that I was expecting some literary masterpiece, but come on, that's just lazy writing. Like other reviewers had noted before me, everything happened just so conveniently, without any real struggle or challenge and therefore without any character development. Jenny conveniently got a book deal from the very first try. Pete conveniently found a job within weeks. Maggie conveniently got pregnant while Owen was conveniently already in love with her after a few weeks of screw... pardon me - dating.Also, why did Vanessa Greene choose by far the most boring character to be the narrator? And what about that ending? Greene missed the opportunity to show us that Jenny has grown beyond her stupid obsession with teacups and realized the fact she's marrying the man of her dreams while surrounded by her loved ones was what mattered (which would be fairly predictable but at least we would have SOME character development). Instead, the three annoyingly perfect husbands saved the day (and Whiney Jenny's \"perfect wedding\"; I mean, it's just teacups, girl, grow up!)."}, {"userName": "Dale Harcombe", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800708-dale-harcombe", "userReview": "This is a light, easy read. Three women, Jenny, Maggie and Alison meet at a garage sale where they find a vintage tea set which they agree to share. The three women are very different and in different stages of life, yet an instant friendship is formed between the woman. It\u2019s a story of friendship and chapters are related from each woman\u2019s point of view. Personally I found Jenny and the other bride in this story rather shallow and selfish as they obsessed about having everything perfect for their wedding days. But maybe that\u2019s because I see the wedding day as less important than focusing on getting the marriage right.As well as being about vintage teacups and friendship, it has romance and also the difficulties inherent in some relationships. A couple of the secondary characters took my attention. I loved Ruby and Derek, the original owners of the tea set and the positive picture portrayed of a long term loving marriage. For me this novel raised no huge issues but was just a bit of fun to read. And sometimes that\u2019s all you want in a novel."}, {"userName": "Aramiheartilly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26981919-aramiheartilly", "userReview": "I don't think I can keep reading this. I had such high hopes and it just didn't even deliver. It sounded like such a good and interesting real-life problems story and I was really looking forwards to reading it so it's a shame really. Nice enough characters but the plots seem a bit all over the place (fair enough as life kinda is) and, though it may sound like a small thing to mention, I was unhappy that the only non-straight character (minor character in back ground so no spoilers) in the book had a spouse that had previously died. I really, really dislike it when authors do that. As if they're saying it's cool and all but yeah.... their spouse died and they don't get to be happy. I just I don't know. It's such a very minor thing but it struck the wrong nerve with me. I still kept reading despite that but I can't put myself through this any longer. I hope the characters get happy endings but don't think I'm going to stick around to see for myself. Might change my mind. Just not sure. Got 63% of the way through and that's something."}, {"userName": "BJ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4690460-bj", "userReview": "Once I got into this book, I really enjoyed it. Its about one of my favorite subjects, the friendships of women. The three main characters meet at a swap meet over a tea set. All 3 want the set, so having just met, they decide to buy it together and share it. Jenny wants the tea set for her wedding reception, so she'll use it first; Maggie owns a floral shop and event planning business and wants to use it for a wedding event she is planning, she'll be second in line; and Ali sells a lot of homemade things to boutiques and online and wants the teacups for candles, she'll receive it finally, make her candles and sell them. This is the start of their friendship and the book covers the happenings of the summer they meet. All three women are in different stages of their lives. Jenny is just starting out, Maggie is single, divorced, and childless; and Ali is married with 2 girls and her husband is out of work. Loved the story of how these women bonded.
