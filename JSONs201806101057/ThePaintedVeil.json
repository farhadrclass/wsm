When I saw 'The Painted Veil' on sale at Audible.com, I thought it would be a nice change of pace. I wasn't wrong. This book proved to be far better than I expected.'The Painted Veil' is set in England and China, taking place in the 1920's. It is a story of love, betrayal, revenge and redemption. I definitely wasn't prepared for some of the twists and turns that this story took, but I enjoyed every minute.Kitty Fane moved to Hong Kong with her husband, Walter. An incredibly intelligent man, Walter is also socially awkward. He loves Kitty, but is rather unapproachable and aloof. Eventually, Walter grew on me, but he isn't the type of \"warm-fuzzy\" character that you bond with immediately. From the start, it is made very clear that he is head-over-heels in love with his wife.Likewise, it is immediately evident that Kitty does not return the sentiment. Kitty is beautiful, vain and shallower than a kiddie pool. While Walter married for love, she makes not ifs, ands, or buts about the fact that she did not. It is clear that she married Walter solely so that she would not be one-upped by her younger sister's upcoming nuptials. In fact, Kitty seems to loathe Walter...at least, initially.So, it was no big surprise that Kitty spent her days in the arms of the charming, and also married, Charles Townsend, while Walter was busy at work. No doubt, the dumb twit was just the most recent in what was bound to be a long line of extramarital conquests for Charles. Stupid Kitty believed that he was as in love with her as she was with him. Poor fool.Unlike his wife, Walter has no illusions. He knew that Kitty didn't love him the way he loved her, but he wanted her so badly that he was willing to marry her anyway. He may have known that she didn't love him, but he did expect for her to be faithful.When he discovers her adultery, he gives Kitty an option. He will grant her a divorce, if Charles will agree in writing to divorce his wife and marry Kitty immediately thereafter. Or, Kitty can accompany Walter into rural China where he has accepted a job assisting with the medical management of the cholera epidemic. Of course, Walter already knows exactly how this will work out. Kitty seems to be the only one surprised by Charles' duplicity.I have to say that Walter had a special place in my heart. I love stories with darker themes and am drawn to anti-heroes. There was something so sinister and calculating about Walter that really drew me to him. Kitty was right to be afraid of her husband, even as she knew that he loved her. Walter was kind of a scary guy. Arriving in the small village, it is immediately apparent that Kitty is being punished for her transgressions. Walter keeps her at a distance and is cold, at best. It becomes clear to Kitty that Walter is seeking revenge, using cholera to commit a passive murder/suicide. It was sick. It was twisted. It was goddamn brilliant!The more time she spent in the village, the more Kitty came to see the error of her ways. For the first time, Kitty grew to appreciate her husband and even admire him. Though she never really fell in love with him, she finally felt shame and remorse for her actions.As much as I disliked Kitty at the onset of this book, she grew on me. I came to see her as an imperfect human, a product of her privileged upbringing and societal expectations. Similarly, I came to see some of Walter's flaws. He wasn't entirely a victim as I believed, early on.I can't say that there is one \"moral of the story\" that really stands out to me with the book. There were many. This book was a beautiful, albeit heartbreaking, account of the human experience.Although this isn't my usual type of story, I enjoyed it immensely. There were plenty of twists and turns along the way that I didn't see coming. Early on, I thought I had it all worked out in my head, but I was sooo wrong. This story did not pan out the way I had envisioned, but it was strangely fitting for this couple.Overall, I thought that this was a wonderful book. It isn't a particularly happy or uplifting read, but it was great in and of it's own accord. This is one that will definitely hang with me for a while. I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "Resentment's PresentimentThe time will come / When you'll be blue / Your cheatin' heart will tell on you...Hank Williams, 1952You'll look for me but baby I'll be gone.This is all I gotta say to you woman: Your time is gonna comeLed Zeppelin, 1969The English word \"resent\" or \"resentment\" comes from the Old French resentir, meaning to \"feel again, feel in turn\" (13c.) That is, to replay, feeling again and again, the thoughts and emotions arising from a negative event that's already happened. For example, getting confirmation that your spouse has been unfaithful though you did not catch her in the act, and then \"imagining\" her and her lover in bed doing naughty things to each other, laughing and ridiculing you, and projecting these few scenes with slight variations each time, hundreds of times in the following months so that it becomes a reality in the mind's eye.This novel is Somerset Maugham's calamitous case study on the travesties begotten by a faithless, heartless wife who is--frankly--gullible to the charms of a cocksure cad, and of her caring cuckold's emotional pain and his poisonous and uncontrollable resentment.Kitty Fane ruthlessly ridicules her husband, Dr. Walter Fane, to her lover as she dreams of marrying this cad she can't see is playing her. Though the husband Walter loves Kitty still, after he finds out of the affair, his selfish desire for revenge goads him into taking her with him to rural China, the heart of the cholera epidemic. As Euripides said, \"The worst, the least curable hatred is that which has superseded deep love.\"Prior to departing for China, he asks her: \"How can I be reasonable? To me our love was everything and you were my whole life. It is not very pleasant to realize that to you it was only an episode.\"***\"I know that you're selfish, selfish beyond words, and I know that you haven't the nerve of a rabbit, I know you're a liar and a humbug, I know that you're utterly contemptible. And the tragic part is'--her face was on a sudden distraught with pain--'the tragic part is that notwithstanding I love you with all my heart.\"  Nonetheless, off they go. Dr. Fane works selflessly around the clock to save the cholera-afflicted. Kitty awakens late to the fallacy of her fantasy love and her lover's spinelessness, who (get this..., she finds out) was really only interested in sex. She thereafter undergoes self-discovery, finds her moral compass, and seeks forgiveness, as resentment threatens to consume Walter.Maugham couldn't have found a more perfect setting for exploring the most disastrous of tragedies to a living marriage. Maugham sets up a plethora of symbols on the after-effects of infidelity to contrast with society's notions of a husband and wife.A super potent novel."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "This is so good.The Painted Veil, first published in 1925, is now considered a classic. That fact - combined with the cover, description and the reviews - had me switching into classic-reading mode. That might sound like I've gone a bit mad, but I mean that I approach classics with a different frame of mind and a greater tolerance for slow-moving plots, airy-fairy language and characters I cannot relate that much to. You know what I mean, you cannot expect fast-paced action if you want to appreciate Austen and others like her, violence is toned down in classics, sex is a rarity. This doesn't mean they aren't good, but I always prepare myself for a very different - and perhaps more challenging - kind of read.As it happens, I need not have bothered. This book hooked me from the very first page where Kitty is caught in the bedroom with her lover and kept me interested right the way through. From the delving into Kitty's recent past and her mother's insistence that she marry as soon as possible, to Kitty's relationship with an intelligent and shy man who genuinely loves her but she cannot love back, to the middle of a cholera epidemic that challenges Kitty's views on life and love. Her character development is astounding, how she goes from being an annoyingly fickle and selfish young women, to one who sees the world in a new light and gains a certain wisdom that is only achieved through facing and overcoming hardship.Much about this story reminds me of Gone With the Wind (thankfully, not the length), it's the same idea of an immature and self-centred young woman being unable to appreciate the love of the man by their side until it's too late. They would prefer to fawn over a married man who will never treat them seriously, and yet they are so shocked to discover that their beauty cannot get them everything they want. Both Kitty and Scarlet are extremely spoilt and vain, so used to getting what they want that they are unprepared when life suddenly treats them unkindly. But they do both manage to change and grow stronger as well.This is a very sad novel. I find it sad how Walter was willing to overlook all Kitty's negatives and the fact that she didn't like him at all just so he could have the chance to love her. I know this wasn't her fault but I find it sad that she didn't love him, he was so sweet and kind and under-appreciated. The ending (well, the bit just before) is also sad, but necessary in order for Kitty to become the person she does so I can't really complain about it.I think Kitty's state of mind at the end is an important statement about women at this interesting point in history where women have the vote but very few options in life, the way she realises that it is far more beneficial for everyone - both men and women - if girls aren't simply raised to be weak and mindless wives, but open-minded and independent human beings. Overall, this is a very interesting exploration of people and the relationships between men and women - it definitely won't be the last I read by W. Somerset Maugham."}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "This short masterpiece tells of love, betrayal, and a search for real meaning in life. Kitty is an attractive middle class Brit. The only real future for her is to marry well. But when she finds none of her suitors quite up to her hopes, and with her younger sister becoming engaged, she succumbs to the pressure and agrees to marry Walter, a man who adores her, but whom she finds boring. He takes her with him to Hong Kong where he works as a bacteriologist.There is much here about class. One hero of the story is mother Superior, the head of a corps of nuns dedicated to caring for the sick and the poor. She had been brought up in a very wealthy family in France, but found a purpose in life beyond her personal needs. So too Walter, a shy biologist who risks life and limb to try to stem a cholera epidemic in the interior of China. Maugham offers musings on religion without sounding excessively preachy, and offers a considered view on what makes life worth living. It is a joy to read and to watch as Kitty comes of age, learning from the people she encounters and ultimately sees past the veil of her life to some underlying truth. There are also comments here on the nature of westerners \"doing good\" in cultures considered lesser.Walter's dying words are \"It was the dog that died.\" This is a reference to the poem \"An Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog\" by Oliver Goldsmith. There are various interpretations to be had of the significance of this. The poem tells of a man who is bitten by a mad dog. Yet it is not the man who dies but the dog. In the novel, I believe that Walter sees himself as the mad dog who had dragged Kitty into a life-threatening situation, (foreshadowed by Maugham's prologue) biting her in a way, expecting that it would be a death sentence for her. Instead it was Walter who would pass, thus the irony. (Here is a link  to the poem)The title offers a nice field in which one can play the game interpretation. The title comes from a poem by Shelley, Lift Not the Painted Veil Which Those Who Live. The notions offered in the novel have a primary source here."}, {"userName": "Petra X", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x", "userReview": "The original review was deleted by GR. This book is about the time when society women didn\u2019t work, especially not in the hot and fetid colonies, and this was set in Hong Kong. They sat at home and painted their nails and dreamed of love in the afternoon and sometimes they did it too. Kitty did, she had an affair and her husband found out. He was a good man, as she was to find out, but once crossed, his soul was dark with thoughts of the ultimate revenge \u2013 death, either socially or in reality.He gave his wife a choice, divorce, which would mean the end of her career as a socialite with pretty party dresses, passionate lovers and invitations to all the best balls in town. Or, if she could persuade her married lover to divorce his wife, he would allow that. But the married lover, typical of the species ditched the paramour and kept the wife. So it was either the social ignominy of divorce or she could go with him, a doctor, to sort out a cholera epidemic on mainland China where she might catch and die of the disease herself. She went.And eventually, her character grew and her soul was transformed as she found a higher calling in nursing children and admiration for her well-respected if unlovable husband. Pregnant, she told him she didn\u2019t know if it was his or her lover\u2019s but it mattered not, because the husband got written out at this point in a touching deathbed scene.She returns to Hong Kong, now lodging with her previous paramour and his wife, a heroine and tragic widow, but blots her copy book briefly by one more go-round with the ex-lover. Disgusted with herself she returns to the UK and finding her mother has died, sets herself up to support her father and accompanies him to the Caribbean island where he is to become the resident Chief Justice.There she will dedicate herself to her father and to bringing up the as-yet unborn child. And that\u2019s where the book ends.What the book doesn\u2019t say is that the ex-pat society in the Caribbean is every bit as entertaining as Hong Kong and there is a great deal less poverty and sickness. Less white women gives rarity value even unto the sullied, and in any case, less attention to social mores is paid in tropical climes. I\u2019m sure she got back up on that social roundabout again, but that\u2019s for our imagination.A good book, an odd book for its time giving a lot of power and play to women\u2019s sexuality, but dividing both the men and women into good/celibate (more or less) and sexually active (bad, bad bad). I haven\u2019t seen the film of it, but it\u2019s ideal for a modern remake with a hot young star and plenty of sex scenes."}, {"userName": "Lu\u00eds C.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34132356-lu-s-c", "userReview": "I literally devoured this short novel by Maugham. This was my second meeting with the author and certainly not the last. We met Kitty who married Walter Fane, more for a husband than by real affection. Walter is a man who does not speak much, feeling even less. The novel is centered on Kitty, about his feelings. And the least we can say is that at first, she is not really friendly. She is futile and selfish. This gene does not deceive her husband and she imagines that Townsend will accept without thinking of divorce and marry her. Throughout the novel, Kitty has to face the trials that will make it grow and mature. And that's another Kitty encountered at the end of the novel.I loved the character of Walter also. Seen only through the eyes of his wife, but we guess an intelligent, sensitive and deeply in love with his wife.The novel allows to discover the ravages of cholera in China. Kitty suddenly discovers death and disease. The ending is not a happy ending and I think it fits perfectly with the rest of the novel. In this village devastated by the terrible disease, in the end \"it is the dog that died\" (last sentence of An Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog by Oliver Goldsmith). And that pretty much sums up the story.I loved it.

And oh! how much I loved it! The casting was superb and I felt the chemistry between the main characters. Even now, I watch the movie every once in a while.Then I found out there was the original book and I had to read it. After postponing it for quite some time, I finished reading it yesterday. Although the movie took some liberties from the book, I liked the latter, too.Meet Kitty, a spoiled, self-absorbed and very attractive young woman who finds it difficult to find a man to her liking in order to marry him (her mother was no help in the matter as she always wanted the best match for her beautiful daughter). When her younger sister gets proposed to by a baronet, Kitty finds it imperative that she should marry before her.Enter Walter Fane, a young, introvert bacteriologist who falls deeply in love with her even if he guessed her true character. He is willing to accept her flaws and proposes to her. As Kitty is desperate by now to marry, she accepts in spite of not loving him. After a brief honeymoon in Italy, they travel to Hong Kong because of Walter's work. Here, our foolish heroine starts an affair with Charles Townsend, a married British vice consul. Inevitably, they are caught. Walter gives Kitty two options: either he divorces her on grounds of adultery, or she accompanies him to a small village in a remote area of China, where he has volunteered to treat victims of a cholera epidemic. Kitty runs to Charles (with whom she is madly in love) and proposes they both divorce and marry. Unlike Kitty, her lover does not wish to abandon his wife, so she is forced to go with Walter.From this point on, I'll let you find out for yourself what happens next. I'll just say that this is where the differences between the book and the movie really begin. And although I prefer the movie in regard to their stay in the Chinese village, the book is very good, too.I highly recommend W. Somerset Maugham's book. It shows that human character is submitted to change should the individual allow it."}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "The Painted Veil is a remarkable golden oldie. Published in 1925 for the first time, it had slightly different approach to stories in the sense that the author punched a good story into 246 pages and said more with his economy of words, than 1000+-page novels. FROM THE BLURB:\n\nLess known than his masterpiece Of Human Bondage, this 1925 Somerset Maugham novel rips at your emotions with its portrayal of an adulterous wife. When the bacteriologist husband of Kitty Fane learns of her infidelity, he forces her to accompany him into the festering center of a Chinese cholera epidemic.\n\nThe author explained in the foreword that the book was based on a story, rather than characters. While living in Italy and receiving Italian lessons, his tutor, Ersilia, introduced him to the fifth canto of the inferno.\nLa Pia: Ante-Purgatory, Purgatorio 5 \"Siena made me, Maremma unmade me\" (5.134). This chillingly concise phrase tells us that the speaker here is Pia Tolomei: born to a noble family of Siena, this woman was allegedly killed in 1295 on the orders of her husband, Paganello de' Pannocchieschi. \"Nello,\" a Tuscan leader of the guelphs, owned a castle in the Maremma (the coastal region near Siena). While some say the murder took place with such secrecy that its manner was never known, others claim Nello ordered a servant to take Pia by the feet and drop her from the castle window. A motive for the murder may have been Nello's desire to marry his neighbor, a widowed countess. Pia's concern for Dante's well being and her request to be remembered perhaps recall the courtesy displayed by another woman, Francesca, in the fifth canto of the Inferno.\nW. Somerset Maugham used this story to plot his own novel, playing itself out in England and Hong Kong. The main character is the love-starved, spoiled young woman, Kitty Fane. Forced into marriage by circumstances, she lands up going to China with her new husband, Dr. Walter Fane, a bacteriologist, who was stationed in Hong-Kong. Kitty was vain, loved to laugh and play, and found her new husband boring and sometimes disgusting. It wasn't long before she started an affair, fell head over heels in love and believed that she has found the real meaning of love. When Walter confronted her, he gave her an ultimatum. Either to go with him to Meitan-fu, a cholera region where an epidemic broke out, the worst one in fifty years, or he files for a divorce. The condition was that Charles Townsend, her lover should confirm in writing that he would divorce his wife and marry Kitty, with Charles's wife confirming in writing that she will divorce Charles. If Walter's conditions were not met, Kitty would have to accompany him on his journey to avoid a scandal.Walter: 'I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve thought me a bigger fool than I am.\u2019 She did not quite know what to say. She was undecided whether indignantly to assert her innocence or to break out into angry reproaches. He seemed to read her thoughts......'I had no illusions about you,\u2019 he said. \u2018I knew you were silly and frivolous and empty-headed. But I loved you. I knew that your aims and ideals were vulgar and common-place. But I loved you. I knew that you were second-rate. But I loved you. It\u2019s comic when I think how hard I tried to be amused by the things that amused you and how anxious I was to hide from you that I wasn\u2019t ignorant and vulgar and scandal-mongering and stupid. I knew how frightened you were of intelligence and I did everything I could to make you think me as big a fool as the rest of the men you knew. I knew that you\u2019d only married me for convenience. I loved you so much, I didn\u2019t care. Most people, as far as I can see, when they\u2019re in love with some one and the love isn\u2019t returned feel that they have a grievance. They grow angry and bitter. I wasn\u2019t like that. I never expected you to love me, I didn\u2019t see any reason that you should, I never thought myself very lovable. I was thankful to be allowed to love you and I was enraptured when now and then thought you were pleased with me or when I noticed in your eyes a gleam of good-humoured affection. I tried not to bore you with my love; I know I couldn't afford to do that and I was always on the lookout for the first sign that you were impatient with my affection. What most husbands expect as a right I was prepared to receive as a favor.'The implication was that Walter would not kill her, as in the Purgatorio of Dante, but take her to a region where she might die of a terrible disease. By stating the conditions, he knew Kitty was to learn a few lessons she would never forget. That was as far as the plot was based on the fith canto of the Inferno. The title was derived from an unfinished sonnet of Shelley: Lift not the painted veil which those who live call LifeW. Somerset Maugham's story had a twist to it, which resulted in Kitty growing up, discover the meaning of life and love and repent for everything she did that caused her and everyone around her harm. Her greatest victory was to call Charles the most vain and fatuous ass that was her bad luck to ever come across. But to reach that point, she had to learn from four French nuns in a convent for orphans, what love really meant. And she got to know her gentle, kind husband, who were admired by everyone except her. The denouement is not what you think. This is a lovestory and not a lovestory. It's about love and all its definitions. And for me, it was a tribute to the role of different kind of men playing a role in a woman's life. The ending was sad, darnit, I was beyond grieving, but accepted the realism of it. And it was positive. Quite an unusual story. A beautiful one, really."}, {"userName": "Tea Jovanovi\u0107", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3103000-tea-jovanovi", "userReview": "Jedna od meni najdra\u017eih Momovih knjiga...

This description ends with the words: \"The Painted Veil is a beautifully written affirmation of the human capacity to grow, to change, and to forgive.\" Well, I would say that this can certainly be debated! This is an ideal book for a book club; there is much that can be discussed. Views will differ. Some people find this book a huge disappointment. Others like it very much. So how do you go about deciding whether to read it or not? For me the answer is simple. If you need to like the characters in a book, then I doubt this book will suit you. If you need characters to grow wiser, mature and improve themselves then your opinion will be up for grabs. If you want a book that draws realistic characters that do what a person with that personality would do, then yeah, I think you\u2019ll like this. This is why I liked it. This is my favorite by W. Somerset Maugham.The author states in the short introduction that this is the only one of his books where he started with an idea for a plot and thereafter invented characters to fit the events. Usually he began in the opposite end, with a character or characters around which he constructed a plot. This worried me since character portrayal is more important to me than plot! Don't worry as I did. Every character is exceedingly well drawn. Just as with real, live people, no two are alike. Each one has a very specific and clear personality. Each one's actions and words and thoughts correspond perfectly with their different personalities. This is why I so liked the book. I repeatedly stopped and considered how would such a person behave? Always their actions rang true. OK, one may not like the actions, but what is delivered is how people really are. There are two nuns. They help balance the shallowness found in some, the anger and inability to forgive found in another. Most significantly, the characters are utterly real. Real because you understand them and because each is a mix of good and bad qualities. Description of places occasionally took my breath away. Description of clothes, facial appearances and manners are astute. Superb dialogs. What I am saying is that the writing, the language used, is exceptionally good! Sometimes lyrical, most often precise. I listened to the audiobook narrated by Joanna Ward, alias Kate Reading. Don\u2019t read the paper book. Don\u2019t listen to an audiobook narrated by another; Reading\u2019s narration is so magnificently well done. Perfect - perfect speed, excellent clarity and exceptionally well interpreted intonations that reflect the respective characters\u2019 personalities. I never imagined I would enjoy this so very, very much. Honestly, there is nothing I can think of to complain about.

I saw the movie first and loved it. It is a brilliant and beautiful love story -- and who can resist Edward Norton's stoic, yet smoldering interpretation of Walter. You can appreciate the movie better once you read the book and get to know the characters as they were originally intended. The movie does a good job of interpreting those characters honestly and uses dialogue verbatim from the book. But, in the movie, Walter and Kitty are much more likeable -- probably because they find (SPOILER ALERT)redemption in their love for one another, and Kitty is able to resist Charlie's later advances.While the book was well-written, I was expecting a similar ending to the movie and was all the more disappointed with Kitty in particular. I would have liked to experience more resolution between Kitty and Walter, but she was trying to be honest -- and if she truly did not love him, it would not have been fair to expect her to say she did. It was still disappointing. Equally, if not more, disappointing still was the way Kitty was able to dismiss her experiences with Walter and the epidemic as part of another world -- how, far too quickly, she embraced the luxuries and comforts of life back in Hong Kong. But, perhaps, this was more realistic.Even still, it is the moment I became less forgiving of her character and the direction the book was taking. I would have liked her to have still more sympathy and love for her family, became more transparent with Waddington and, finally, resist Charlie -- even one last time. She didn't change as much as I had hoped. The book did have one very redemptive moment for me at the end -- Kitty told her father that (SPOILER ALERT) she would raise her daughter to be self-sufficient. I did not expect the book to have such a clear message. It made a lot of sense, but still did not entirely redeem Kitty for me. She experienced moments of truth, which were so revealing, but ultimately more frustrating than they were helpful. I only hope she was able to raise her daughter to be more compassionate and less self-absorbed -- but, for a character like Kitty, it seems unlikely."}, {"userName": "Mohammed-Makram", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15385951-mohammed-makram", "userReview": "\u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0627\u0646\u0629 \u0630\u0646\u0628 \u062b\u0642\u064a\u0644 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0637\u0647\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0649 \u0648 \u0627\u0646\u0643\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0648 \u0645\u0633\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0644\u0648 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0649 \u0623\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0628\u0627\u0621 \u062d\u064a\u062b \u0646\u062a\u0637\u0647\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0646\u0648\u0628\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u0648\u0636\u0639 \u0623\u0631\u0648\u0627\u062d\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0643\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646"}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "There is something infinitely fascinating to me about stories like this - a clever, passionate man falling in love with a pretty but fickle woman who, he knows, will never understand and appreciate his worth, and yet, he can't resist.

While reading this book I just kept thinking, what if? What if women were allowed to seek their own status and power and weren\u2019t completely dependent on that of their husbands? What if girls weren\u2019t isolated but allowed to travel and gain experience or an education? What if marriage were optional? What if divorce were a simple thing? But I guess even the possible solutions to these hypotheticals wouldn\u2019t remove all the sadness from this book. What if we weren\u2019t all born with a severely limited worldview? would be a better question, but of course that\u2019s just a permanent part of the human condition.Kitty Fane, in many respects, has the worldview of a small child, and that is her tragedy. She was bred to make an advantageous marriage \u2013 to finally realize all of her mother\u2019s long repressed ambitions. She was raised in a narrow, cosseted, ridiculously skewed environment and so became narrow, cosseted, and ridiculously skewed. Kitty doesn\u2019t want to be married, but after several seasons out and no husband, the pressure to choose someone increases. Desperate to appease her mother and beat her younger sister to the altar, she accepts the hand of quiet, intellectual bacteriologist Walter who seems to have genuine feeling for her, even though he barely knows her. Kitty is foolish, selfish, immature, and closed-minded. She doesn\u2019t love Walter \u2013 in fact \u2013 he bores and irritates her. Once in Walter\u2019s assigned post of Hong Kong, she begins an affair with the charming and middle aged (not to mention, married) Charles Townsend. And that\u2019s where this book opens: a bedroom, a locked door, two lovers, and a humiliated husband.I admit that I loved Kitty from the beginning, even though her choices were maddening. She\u2019s weak-willed and horribly na\u00efve, but she does have the good sense to realize when she\u2019s been wrong. And she has the courage to try to change herself, even though she doesn\u2019t always succeed. Maugham doesn\u2019t reform her completely and I think she\u2019s all the more sympathetic for that. She fights against her own barriers: against her weakness and selfishness and outright disgust of the Chinese, but she never becomes a perfect, enlightened adult.I think that one of the hallmarks of adulthood is that moment when you feel like you\u2019ve become stable: when you finally feel like you\u2019ve learned a few things. You finally feel mature. And then something comes along and casually knocks you off your feet and you realize that you still don\u2019t know a damn thing. Kitty experiences that completely, and I think it\u2019s a huge testament to how much maturity she gains that she picks herself up, brushes herself off, and keeps on going. Her mistakes in this book actually made me love her even more, because she doesn\u2019t let them define her.Nor is Walter portrayed as the simple, wounded hero. This story really is about Kitty and Kitty\u2019s journey toward maturity but Walter is by no means a side character. It frankly amazed me just how vivid and three-dimensional he felt, given that he\u2019s barely in the novel at all! Maugham was able to paint Walter so completely in brief, concentrated scenes (\u201cIt was the dog that died.\u201d Talk about a punch in the face!). But of course, Walter is a quiet person: he speaks in actions or silences and rarely ever with words. Although, his one major speech in the book, where he basically tells Kitty exactly where she can go, is very satisfying:\"I knew you were silly and frivolous and empty-headed. But I loved you. I knew that your aims and ideals were vulgar and commonplace. But I loved you. I knew that you were second-rate. But I loved you. It's comic when I think how hard I tried to be amused by the things that amused you and how anxious I was to hide from you that I wasn't ignorant and vulgar and scandal-mongering and stupid. I knew how frightened you were of intelligence and I did everything I could to make you think me as big a fool as the rest of the men you knew. I knew that you'd only married me for convenience. I loved you so much, I didn't care.\"He\u2019s shy and self-contained with little to no charm. He\u2019s sensitive and passionate, but when wronged that passion becomes an ugly thing. He becomes cold and he can\u2019t forgive. He\u2019s far from the meek fool that Charles Townsend assumes he is and he\u2019s also not the sweet loving husband that Kitty thought she married. However, Walter\u2019s love for Kitty is just as na\u00efve as her love for Charles Townsend, and in the end it is she (not he \u2013 \u201cthe dog\u201d) who has the resiliency and bravery to forgive and try to move forward. When set against the wildness of rural China and the indiscriminate brutality of cholera, their doomed relationship becomes even more of a pointless tragedy.

I'd obviously heard of the author, but really wasn't familiar with his style, so went in with no expectations whatsoever. Oh my gosh, what a pleasant surprise to find out that it was utterly fantastic. It's about Kitty, a young woman who has somehow found herself married to a man she's not even fond of, much less in love with. The book starts with her affair - or rather, her fear of discovery, as she hears an ominous rattle on the door handle whilst still in bed with her lover. What follows next is unexpected - a passive aggressive response from her husband and a swift removal to a country riddled with cholera. Had her husband moved her there to kill her? And if so, will he succeed?Without ruining the story - the ending is unexpected and poignant. Kitty, though by no means a particularly sympathetic character (spoiled and a bit empty-headed about sums it up), has a glorious resilience, and manages to find her own way in the world, sans any men. Although of its time, there's a definite note of female strength here, which naturally resonated with me strongly. (I do love a strong female lead!). Yes, there's regrettable racism in this book, which made me wince every time I encountered it - but I suppose we must remember that the author was a product of his time. For the most part, ugly racial stereotypes aside, this is a beautiful exploration of the intricacies of relationships, the inequality of love, and the joy of finding hidden reserves of strength in oneself, even in times of peril."}, {"userName": "Maria Clara", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46308842-maria-clara", "userReview": "Qu\u00e9 dif\u00edcil hacer una rese\u00f1a cuando no te salen las palabras!

For Walter Fane, a bacteriologist working in early-twentieth-century colonial Hong Kong, the choice is easy. Either he will divorce his wife, which will disgrace her and leave her destitute (she was never taught to work or be independent, having always been expected to make a brilliant marriage), or, as a penance, she will have to accompany him on a trip to Southern China, where he has volunteered to work as a doctor in a cholera-ridden area from which few people return alive. Unable to face poverty and social disgrace, Kitty assents to her husband's proposal, convinced that he is hoping the trip will kill her. But is he really?Most authors would turn a melodramatic story like the above into a cliche-riddled soap opera in which husband and wife, out in the wilds, share some dramatic, eye-opening experiences and come to appreciate and love each other, after which the wife, having obtained her husband's forgiveness, dies a tearful death. For let's face it, who could resist a beautiful woman's death in such an exotic setting? To his credit, Maugham gives his readers a different ending, one in which Kitty is allowed to live and learn. Does she become a radically different person? Nope, she doesn't. Decades' worth of miseducation can't right a wrong like that. But she does gain a new insight into life in general and her life in particular, and tries to make amends for earlier wrongs. That's more than you expect from her at the beginning of the book, where she seems an entirely vapid and selfish being, another one of those horrid female characters Maugham drew so well.Whether or not you enjoy The Painted Veil largely depends on your tolerance for melodrama, unlikeable characters and racism, all of which abound in the book. My own tolerance for such things is substantial (at least in books -- not so much in real life), so I didn't mind the book too much. On the contrary, I found myself engrossed in the psychological details of the story -- the love, the loathing, the fear, the longing, the weakness, the growing awareness, the sense that forgiveness and redemption may be just around the corner. I also found myself (not for the first time) admiring Maugham's prodigious talent for characterisation. All the characters in the book, from the protagonists to the bit players, are fascinating and well drawn. I was intrigued by Walter, the quiet scientist who may or may not intend to let a horrible disease waste away his wife. I would have liked the story to be told more from his point of view, but then again, that would have made him less mysterious, which probably would have ruined the effect. Like many readers, I didn't overly care for Kitty, but I found it interesting to follow her journey and meet the men in her life. As I said, Maugham is a master of characterisation, and in The Painted Veil he presents some very interesting men. Charlie, Kitty's vain lover, is a superb creation, as is Waddington, an officer Kitty and Walter meet in China, who teaches Kitty that it's all right to defy society's expectations every now and then. The story itself may not be Maugham's best (I much prefer Of Human Bondage), but it certainly features memorable characters, as well as a social message which I'm sure was much needed at the time of writing. I can't wait to see the film adaptation, which apparently is even better than the book..."}, {"userName": "Duane", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24389390-duane", "userReview": "I've always been amazed at the effort the British took to maintain their aristocratic traditions in their distant colonies. The Painted Veil a beautifully written story about a young wife, Kitty Fane, who is brought to Hong Kong by her doctor husband in the 1920's. She doesn't love her husband so she soon falls in love and begins an affair with her husbands superior. It's the story of how one-sided relationships can lead to heartbreak for everyone involved. This is a sad and tragic story but still beautiful and magical in the telling of it. 4.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Eirini Proikaki", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2017", "userURL":

At first, the story of the feckless Kitty Fane reads so simplistically that I seriously wondered why Maugham was considered the brilliant writer that he was. It wasn't until Kitty and Walter began their tranformative journey to Mei-tan-fu that I began to sense why this is such a beloved book, in spite of the fact that Maugham creates and sets up two of the least lovable/admirable main characters since Kathy and Heathcliff. In spite of (or because of) that, the journey of Kitty and Walter Fane takes not only a physical toll to this damaged couple, but also a moral and spiritual one as well. As much as I loved this book, I would add that I question Maugham's ending, and personally feel that the movie adaptation presented a much better resolution then his more ambigious one. That was very likely his intent, but I confess that I preferred the more cut and dried morality tale set up by the screen writers. But I will also confess that Maugham's ending has kept me thinking of this book for 3 days straight after finishing it, so perhaps his way is, in actuality, the superior.In fact, Walter's dying words caused me to google the Oliver Goldsmith poem Walter references on his deathbed:An Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog Good people all, of every sort, Give ear unto my song; And if you find it wondrous short, It cannot hold you long. In Islington there was a man, Of whom the world might say That still a godly race he ran, Whene'er he went to pray. A kind and gentle heart he had, To comfort friends and foes; The naked every day he clad, When he put on his clothes. And in that town a dog was found, As many dogs there be, Both mongrel, puppy, whelp and hound, And curs of low degree. This dog and man at first were friends; But when a pique began, The dog, to gain some private ends, Went mad and bit the man. Around from all the neighbouring streets The wondering neighbours ran, And swore the dog had lost his wits, To bite so good a man. The wound it seemed both sore and sad To every Christian eye; And while they swore the dog was mad, They swore the man would die. But soon a wonder came to light, That showed the rogues they lied: The man recovered of the bite,The dog it was that died.hmm...much like Walter's last words, The Painted Veil might mystify, intrigue, and haunt the reader long after the last page is completed. It did for me."}, {"userName": "Bkwmlee", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45796209-bkwmlee", "userReview": "I\u2019m quite stingy when it comes to rating books and normally would not give more than 4 stars, even for a book I thoroughly enjoyed. However, in the case of W. Somerset Maugham\u2019s classic The Painted Veil, the first thought that came into my head after finishing the book is that this is a masterpiece that absolutely deserves nothing less than 5 stars!The entire book is beautifully and tightly written, using what I would categorize as \u201cclassical\u201d language, but in a style that is simple and easy to understand. Maugham did a fantastic job telling the story of how the main character Kitty Fane\u2019s adulterous affair and the aftermath of it causes her to re-assess and make changes in her life that she never thought possible. In all honesty, from the beginning of the story to the very end, I did not like Kitty one bit. I felt she was silly and foolish (and vain, immature, self-centered, etc.) and even when she \u201cchanges for the better\u201d later on, I still couldn\u2019t bring myself to like her. No doubt that Kitty grew a lot after her experiences in China, but I actually still saw a bit of the same characteristics in her, albeit to a much lesser degree. As I was reading, my feelings towards Kitty went from despising her in the beginning to pitying her later on in the story (the pity comes from acknowledgement of the fact that, in a sense, part of her plight truly WAS due to societal conventions and how she was raised). Since I read this book for one of my book clubs, I don\u2019t intend to write a long review on it, as I prefer to save more in-depth analysis for when we discuss the book. However, for anyone who may be considering whether to read this book or not, my response is a wholehearted YES! The amount of ground that Maugham was able to cover \u2013 love, betrayal, redemption, society norms and conventions, culture, marriage and relationships, religion, gender roles and stereotypes, class structure, etc. \u2013 in such a short book (my Kindle version was less than 200 pages) is not only astounding but also extremely rare. Don\u2019t let the \u201cclassic\u201d label fool you into thinking this will be a difficult book to get through because it definitely won\u2019t be \u2013 this book is an easy read, yet still invokes much insight into numerous topics that are still relevant today.Lastly, I know there was a movie adaptation of this book that came out around 10 years ago, but I actually don\u2019t plan on watching it, at least not any time soon. I\u2019m very particular when it comes to book to movie/tv series adaptations, especially ones that turn out to be very different from the book due to changes made by the producers/directors. I don\u2019t want my memory of the book to be ruined if I end up disliking the movie\u2019s interpretation of the story/characters."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol", "userReview": "Set in 1920's England and Hong Kong, this sad classic tale tells the story of an extremely vain and spoiled young Kitty Fane who doesn't appreciate the love of a good husband until it's too late, but learns about love and forgiveness in the end.
