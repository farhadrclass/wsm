THE delicious, curl up next to the fire under a blanket with tea book. THE windowsill on a rainy day with your pet book. THE stay up all night book. A chill goes down your spine (but in a good way!) while reading it. It is a masterpiece of gothic literature, the inheritor of the tradition of novels like Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. I'd call it the 20th Century Jane Eyre, actually, with a modernist twist. It is written so that the characters and events come to seem quite believable in the context even while they slowly make the hairs on the back of your necks stand on end. Whether you're generally a fan of mystery, romance or thrillers, this book is quite simply a delicious read."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Keeten", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten", "userReview": "\u201dLast night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\".This is one of the more famous lines in literature certainly it belongs in the same conversation as Call me Ishmael. Even to people who have never read the book or seen the excellent movie by Alfred Hitchcock might have a glimmer of recognition at the mention of a place called Manderley. Daphne du Maurier leased a place called Menabilly which became the basis for the fictional Manderley. Aren\u2019t we glad she changed the name? Just say Manderley a few times and then say Menabilly a few times. If you are like me you linger over the vowels and consonants of Manderley and with Menabilly you just want it off your tongue as quickly as possible.\nDaphne du Maurier on the staircase at MenabillyThe narrator, a young woman of 21, is never formally introduced to us. She is a companion for an odious American woman named Mrs. Van Hoppers. They are in Monte Carlo and when Mrs. Van Hoppers comes down with an illness inspired more by boredom than by a virus or bacteria our narrator finds herself free to spend time with the widower Maximilian de Winter. He is famous, but his house, Manderley is even more famous. Parties on a Gatsby scale, beautiful landscaping, and of course the architecture of a grand English estate have made Manderley a most coveted invitation. \nLaurence Olivier as Maximilian de WinterAfter a whirlwind romance, the dashing de Winter sweeps the impressionable young lady off her feet, pries her loose from the services of Mrs. Van Hoppers, and marries her. He is distant, moody, and yet charming more like a father, he is 42, than a husband, but our young heroine is enamored with the idea of being the mistress of Manderley. Now she has a name, Mrs. de Winter, and maybe to add a bit of obscurity to an already anemic personality du Maurier never shares her given name with us. \nDaphne du Maurier and children at Menabilly the inspiration for ManderleyDaphne du Maurier comes from a famous family. Her grandfather was the famous writer and Punch cartoonist George du Maurier. Her father was a prominent stage manager named Sir Gerald du Maurier and her mother was the actress Muriel Beaumont. Daphne had \u201dbreeding, brains, and beauty\u201dwhich is used in reference to the character Rebecca as well, and luckily du Maurier chose to do more with this trilogy of assets than the character. Du Maurier married Lieutenant General Sir Frederick \u2018Boy\u2019 Browning whose exploits during Operation Market Garden were made into a film A Bridge too Far.The newly minted Mrs. de Winter arrives at Manderley with nervous excitement. She is well aware of her shortcomings. She is too shy, too young, too trusting, and though she is pretty she can not compete with the legendary Rebecca de Winter and her haunting beauty.\u201dRebecca, always Rebecca. Wherever I walked in Manderley, wherever I sat, even in my thought and in my dreams, I met Rebecca. I knew her figure now, the long slim legs, the small and narrow feet. Her shoulders broader than mine, the capable clever hands. Hands that could steer a boat, could hold a horse. Hands that arranged flowers, made the models of ships, and wrote \u2018Max from Rebecca\u2019 on the fly-leaf of a book. I knew her face too, small and oval, the clear white skin, the cloud of dark hair. I knew the scent she wore, I could guess her laughter and her smile. If I heard it, even among a thousand others, I should recognise her voice. Rebecca, always Rebecca. I should never be rid of Rebecca.\u201dWaiting for Mrs. de Winter is the number one fan and torchbearer of Rebecca, Mrs. Danvers. Despite the best efforts of our young lady, she is fighting a losing battle trying to win over Mrs. Danvers by being deferential. Mrs. Danvers is loyal to the ghostly presence of Rebecca even to the point of preserving her room and possessions as they were when she was alive. The more that the new Mrs. de Winter concedes the less respect she feels she has to show to the new mistress of the house. \nMrs. Danvers played by Judith Anderson and Mrs. de Winter played by Joan Fontaine in the 1940 Alfred Hitchcock movie\u201dWe stood there by the door, staring at one another. I could not take my eyes away from hers. How dark and sombre they were in that white skull\u2019s face of hers, how malevolent, how full of hatred.\u201dYou will feel yourself wanting to cheer as our heroine begins to gain confidence and as she begins to grow into her role we see Mrs. Danvers start to diminish and with her the haunting presence of Rebecca. Of course just as things start to go right, things start to go very wrong. I was really surprised to learn that an edition of Rebecca was used as the key to a code book by the Germans during World War Two. It is not believed that the book was ever used for passing information because a captured radio section made the Germans suspect that the book, as a code, had been compromised. Ken Follett used this idea in his book The Key to Rebecca. Other influences of possibly du Maurier\u2019s most famous character creation, show up in Stephen King\u2019s Bag of Bones when Mrs. Danvers is portrayed as the boogeyman. Jasper Ffordes clones an army of Mrs. Danvers in his Thursday Next series that sends a chill down the backs of the characters of those books. There is much made of flowers and landscaping in this book. The English do love their rose gardens and when my backyard is in full bloom it is without reservation that I can share how much pleasure looking at and moving among that bounty of blooms gives me. \u201dNo wild flowers came in the house at Manderley. He had special cultivated flowers, grown for the house alone, in the walled garden. A rose was one of the few flowers, he said, that looked better picked than growing. A bowl of roses in a drawing-room had a depth of colour and scent they had not possessed in the open. There was something rather blowsy about roses in full bloom, something shallow and raucous, like women with untidy hair. In the house they became mysterious and subtle.\u201d\nDaphne du MaurierYou will feel the building tension as du Maurier drops hints of something sinister surrounding the walls of Manderley. For me, the sign of a well written book is the fact that I was on the edge of my seat despite having watched the movie several times. I was ensnared by the plot, feeling the same anxiety for the characters that I would have if they had been living breathing creatures in my own sphere of the universe. The character studies explored in this book have turned out to be an important addition to the hall of fame of literary characters. You will not forget Mrs. Danver\u2019s spiteful, insidious behavior or the tortured, Heathcliffesque Maximilian de Winter or the numerous supporting cast that adds color and substance to the shadows of the plot. If you like gothic romance with your cup of Earl Grey you will find this book an indispensable part of your library, kept ready to hand for those days when you want to be swept away from a dreary sky and a rain splattered window. \u201dThe road to Manderley lay ahead. There was no moon. The sky above our heads was inky black. But the sky on the horizon was not dark at all. It was shot with crimson, like a splash of blood. And the ashes blew towards us with the salt wind from the sea.\u201dCheck out my book and movie reviews at http://www.jeffreykeeten.com"}, {"userName": "Navessa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18104163-navessa", "userReview": "[ He tells Not Cory he loves her.

These six elements have informed the gothic impulse from Udolpho and Jane Eyre to The Thirteenth Tale. Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca is crucial to the genre, for in it du Maurier simplified and organized these six elements, refining the narrative, concentrating the mythic, and enriching the ambiguity of her tale.What du Maurier understood is that the heart of the romantic gothic is the struggle between two women, one waking up not a new life and one not content to remain a ghost. The man may be their conflicting goal, the house and landscape their arena, but it is the battle between these two women, for life and power and autonomy, that is the essence of the tale.In Rebecca, the man is the haunted, moody Maxim de Winter who has married a never-named young woman--a naive paid companion--whom he has met during a recent stay in Monte Carlo. The two return to Maxim's ancestral estate of Manderley, but the new wife soon finds the old house and grounds--as well as the mind of her increasingly melancholy husband--dominated by the spirit of Rebecca, his dead first wife. The author's simplifying genius resides in the fact that in Rebecca the spirit of the dead woman animates the house and the landscape and obsesses the man. Consequently, every attempt of the new Mrs. de Winter--the narrator--to adjust to the house and staff (including the daunting housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers), to explore the house and grounds, or to comprehend the past events that interfere with her present happiness are part of the novel's central struggle and its secret history. The second Mrs. de Winter's descriptions may be nuanced and leisurely, occasionally painful in their innocence, but every encounter, each exploration, brings us closer to the heart of the mystery of Rebecca and Manderley too.Beside the exemplary construction of the narrative, the other things I liked most about the book were the detailed descriptions of Manderley, the lingering power of the first two chapters (the only two set in the present), and the intriguingly ambiguous fate of the narrator of the novel, the second Mrs. de Winter, the woman with no name.One of the guilty pleasures of a good gothic is the description of a magnificent old house, so precise and rich in detail that you can fantasize about how delightful--or how scary--living in such a mansion might be. Manderly is a place that comes alive for the reader, and it is particularly pleasant to have it described to us by a person who is experiencing it--and attempting to master it--for the first time.The first chapter is justly famous for the narrator's account of a dream in which she returns to the now ruined Manderley estate. Its description of overgrown nature reclaiming the martyred grandeur of Manderley is an expertly executed mood piece, inaugurating the narrative as effectively as any opening passage in literature. (I do not exclude my favorites: the first scene of Hamlet, the first chapter of Bleak House, and the description of the Sternwood mansion in the first pages of The Big Sleep). Personally, though, I find the second chapter of the book even more interesting. It describes Maxim and the narrator--who now calls the two of them \"happy\"--as they live their life on the continent in a series of hotels. But something about our narrator's description strikes me as inexpressibly sad: the two of them sound to me like an affluent, aging couple, frittering their final years away on superficial pleasures and trivial pastimes. Yet the wife, the woman who is telling us this--we find out later--is now barely in her thirties. Could this indeed be \"happiness\"? This question continued to haunt me throughout my reading of the book, and even now affects my shifting impressions of its themes.I ask myself, weeks after finishing this novel, what is the narrator's fate? Has she achieved a certain degree of happiness--however modest--having triumphed over the dominating Rebecca, having gained the haunted Maxim for her own? Has she merely accepted the empty social forms and dull routine that Rebecca--whatever her sins might have been--was fighting so furiously against? Or is she \"happy\"--the interpretation I currently flirt with--because she, in her passive-aggressive way, dominates Maxim in his reduced state more thoroughly than Rebecca ever could? Even so, isn't such happiness inferior to the promise she once showed briefly, when she believed she could still be mistress of Manderley--after Rebecca's ghost had been exorcised, before she learned their world had burned down?I don't know the answers to these questions, and I must say I like it that way. For me, at least, the novel will always be haunted by ambiguities, and that is a good thing. It is one of the reasons I find Rebecca such a rich, rewarding work."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "I went in completely 100% blind!!!

Each element - plot, characters, twists, suspense, climax - all of it, perfect! If I had one criticism, it might be a slightly slow start, but with the awesome payoff, that is hardly worth mentioning.The plot - I have to be honest, I judged a book by its cover and title. I thought, okay, \"Rebecca\", an elegant woman, a curly font, probably another cheesy classic romance. I'll read it because it is one you are supposed to read, but I doubt I will think it is great. I have never been so wrong. Mystery, intrigue, deception, subterfuge, twists, turns, misunderstandings, accusations, threats, etc. etc. etc. So much is happening in this story, and it is great!The characters - each character plays their part very well. Because of the nature of the plot, you may not quite ever be sure who some of them really are - and, perhaps, you will be left to make some judgements on your own. Also, this book as two characters that are the essence of love to hate - one because they are a total a-hole, and the other because they are creepy as hell! I don't know what it is, but I often feel like authors frequently have a hard time getting easily hateable characters right. That is far from the case here - they are perfect!Suspense and Mystery - I will keep this short to avoid spoilers. This book has about 7 big climaxes/revelations. Every second between those will have you on the edge of your seat. Others will catch you completely off guard. I can guarantee you will catch yourself holding your breath.So, in summary, I loved it! It was great! Read it! Don't be like me and think \"meh, a classic named Rebecca - probably boring\" It is not! It is awesome!"}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16384209-candace", "userReview": "'Rebecca' is a classic gothic novel that had been hanging out on my TBR list for years. For whatever reason, I had never made it to this highly acclaimed book. In a bit of a reading rut, I decided to tackle it to change things up a bit. Man, am I ever glad that I did! This book was great!I went in to this book blind, knowing only that it was a classic. I didn't have any idea of what I was in for, but I anticipated some sort of sweet and innocent love story like the Bronte sisters are known for. While there was a sort of love story...and it certainly wasn't graphic like you'd expect in today's romance novels...there was nothing \"innocent\" about this story. It was suspenseful and downright creepy at times. There was an eerie sense of unease that pervaded this novel. Despite being nearly a century old, the effect was not diminished in the least.The story begins in Monte Carlo, where the wealthy widower, Maxim de Winter befriends the young, paid companion of a rich, elderly social climber. When her shallow employer falls ill, the young lady, who remains nameless, is invited to spend time gallivanting around Monte Carlo with Mr. de Winter. She is incredibly na\u00efve and instantly smitten with the older, influential man. When her employer regains her health, they are set to return to America immediately. Heartbroken, she seeks out Mr. de Winter to bid him farewell. Only, he has another proposition for her. Happy for the first time since the death of his beloved wife, Rebecca, he is not ready to part ways with the vibrant young lady. He proposes marriage. She accepts, thinking that all of her dreams have come true. She has no idea of what lies ahead of her.After the rushed nuptials, Maxim and his new wife return to his famous country estate, Manderley. It doesn't take long for the mood to turn darker. The second Mrs. de Winter feels like an imposter in her new home, constantly reminded of the beautiful wife that preceded her and seemed to be beloved by all. Mrs. Danvers, the head housekeeper, is more than happy to remind her at every opportunity that she will never be able to measure up.On top of everything else, Maxim seems to be a different man at the estate. He is moody, withdrawn and seems to keep her at arms-length. As she tries to navigate her new high-class lifestyle, to which she had been completely unaccustomed, he seems almost antagonistic at times.The longer she stays at Manderley, the more she comes to realize that things are not as they seem. Rebecca had secrets and the more the second Mrs. de Winter uncovers, the more she begins to question what exactly she got herself into and what kind of danger lurks at Manderley. There is a big twist, which I didn't see coming, but can't say that I was particularly shocked by. It changes everything and casts new light on the mystery surrounding Rebecca's untimely death. The second Mrs. de Winter finally gets the answers to all of her questions, but she might wish that she hadn't unearthed the truth.Since I am primarily a romance reader, I did wish that the love story was a more critical piece of this story. I can't say that I ever really believed that Mr. de Winter really loved his second wife, or even lusted after her for that matter. I never felt that there was a genuine emotional connection between the two, which made the story a little less enjoyable for me. Overall, I still thought that this was a fantastic story. I was surprised by how easily this story was able to transcend time, still proving to be chilling and compelling today. It was a great choice to change it up for me. If you haven't read it, I definitely recommend this one. I hear that the movie is fabulous also, so I plan to check it out as well in the near future."}, {"userName": "Candi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi", "userReview": "Oh, how I wish I could rewind the past month and start all over again! Then I could pick up Rebecca and experience this breathtaking novel once more as if for the first time. Truth be told, this wasn\u2019t actually my first time reading this quintessential piece of classic gothic literature. However, I am ashamed to say that the number of years that have passed between my first reading and this recent one, combined with what I like to call a lingering case of \u2018momnesia\u2019, effectively rendered this reading very much like a first time. For that I am actually grateful, because I completely immersed and surrendered myself to the beautiful writing of the remarkably talented Daphne du Maurier.The unnamed narrator is an inexperienced and insecure young woman with not much of a future to speak of \u2013 unless becoming a companion to an overbearing busybody by the name of Mrs. Van Hopper could be called a promising prospect! So when the handsome, mysterious and wealthy Maxim de Winter seems to take an interest and offers a much more enticing alternative \u2013 that of being his wife \u2013 what is a girl to do but accept?! The honeymoon at an end, the newly married couple returns to Manderley, Max de Winter\u2019s estate. Manderley itself is a major character in this novel. I could sense it almost as a living, breathing entity; the descriptions of this magnificent place were so masterfully crafted. I felt as if I were sitting right there with Mrs. de Winter as she approached Manderley for the first time. \"Suddenly I saw a clearing in the dark drive ahead, and a patch of sky, and in a moment the dark trees had thinned, the nameless shrubs had disappeared, and on either side of us was a wall of colour, blood-red, reaching far above our heads. We were amongst the rhododendrons. There was something bewildering, even shocking, about the suddenness of their discovery. The woods had not prepared me for them. They startled me with their crimson faces, massed one upon the other in incredible profusion, showing no leaf, no twig, nothing but the slaughterous red, luscious and fantastic, unlike any rhododendron plant I had seen before\u2026 these were monsters, rearing to the sky, massed like a battalion, too beautiful I thought, too powerful; they were not plants at all.\" Rhododendrons, Red, Rebecca\u2026 She is everywhere. The second Mrs. de Winter (the only name by which she will ever be identified) had not expected the ceaseless competition from the deceased first Mrs. de winter, Rebecca - Rebecca with a capital R written with such confidence, a confidence that even transcends death. She lingers in the morning-room, she lurks in the gallery, she tarries in the cottage by the beach. But most of all, Rebecca dwells within the minds of everyone living in the West Country along the rugged coast of England. Max de Winter becomes a brooding and aloof husband once back within the clutches of Manderley and Rebecca\u2019s memory. The new Mrs. de Winter is tormented by her own fantasies of this formidable adversary. Since the novel is cleverly written from the perspective of this na\u00efve young woman, the reader becomes intimate with the psychological turmoil she endures. She is also subject to the criticism and malice of the sinister housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. Mrs. Danvers worshiped Rebecca during her life and continues to do so even after her death. I absolutely loved to hate this dark and intimidating woman! \"Once more, I glanced up at her and once more I met her eyes, dark and somber, in that white face of hers, instilling into me, I knew not why, a strange feeling of disquiet, of foreboding. I tried to smile, and could not; I found myself held by those eyes, that had no light, no flicker of sympathy towards me.\"Every single character is drawn skillfully and comes to life within the pages of this book. The tension builds and one cannot help becoming entangled with the suspenseful buildup of events leading to the climax. I was transported to another time and place and was perfectly mesmerized. I can\u2019t say much more without getting into spoiler territory if you have not yet read this masterpiece. Just grab a copy soon and experience this one \u2013 please! This is the best of the best and is going on that very special bookshelf at home. \"I wondered how many people there were in the world who suffered, and continued to suffer, because they could not break out from their own web of shyness and reserve, and in their blindness and folly built up a great distorted wall in front of them that hid the truth. This was what I had done. I had built up false pictures in my mind and sat before them. I had never had the courage to demand the truth.\""}, {"userName": "Arlene Sanders", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1183516-arlene-sanders", "userReview": "HERE IS MY HEART...REBECCA is my favorite book of all time -- bar none.The opening line is famous, but I didn\u2019t know that the first time I read it (I was about 14). I just remember that the magic began with that first line:Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderly again....The girl is young, clumsy, exquisitely sensitive. Impoverished and alone after her father\u2019s death, she was employed by a wealthy and boorish social climber, Mrs. Van Hopper, and made her living as the older woman\u2019s companion. Maxim de Winter, handsome, fabulously rich, and the owner of Manderly, one of the finest estates in England, crosses paths with the women in Monte Carlo.As the girl falls crazy in love with de Winter, revealing herself as the most flaming romantic in all of British literature, she sees him like this:He belonged to a walled city of the fifteenth century, a city of narrow, cobbled streets, and thin spires, where the inhabitants wore pointed shoes and worsted hose. His face was arresting, sensitive, medieval in some strange inexplicable way, and I was reminded of a portrait seen in a gallery I had forgotten where, of a certain Gentleman Unknown.And like this:Could one but rob him of his English tweeds, and put him in black, with lace at this throat and wrists, he would stare down at us in our new world from a long distant past\u2014a past where men walked cloaked at night, and stood in the shadow of old doorways, a past of narrow stairways and dim dungeons, a past of whispers in the dark, of shimmering rapier blades, of silent, exquisite courtesy.(I thought I was a romantic!)However, I never saw him the way she did. Even as a teenager, I thought de Winter was a horse\u2019s ass and a male chauvinist pig if ever there was one, and to this day, I don't understand what women see in him:\u201cSo Mrs. Van Hopper has had enough of Monte Carlo,\u201d he said,\u201cand now she wants to go home. So do I. She to New York and I to Manderly. Which would you prefer? You can take your choice.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make a joke about it, it\u2019s unfair,\u201d I said, \u201cand I think I had better see about those tickets, and say good-bye now.\u201d\u201cIf you think I\u2019m one of the people who try to be funny at breakfast, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m invariably ill-tempered in the early morning. I repeat to you, the choice is open to you. Either you go to America with Mrs. Van Hopper or you come home to Manderly with me.\u201d\"Do you mean you want a secretary or something?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m asking you to marry me, you little fool.\u201d(Prick!)Then this:\"So that's settled, isn't it?\" he said, going on with his toast and marmalade; \"instead of being companion to Mrs. Van Hopper you become mine, and your duties will be almost exactly the same. I also like new library books, and flowers in the drawing-room, and bezique after dinner. And someone to pour out my tea. . .and you must never let me run out of my particular brand of toothpaste.\"(Prick!) (Women certainly don't want male chauvinist swine as employers, but we accept them as husbands and lovers, because mostly that's all there is, so we have to make do.) The spirit of Rebecca herself -- the first Mrs. de Winter -- pervades the novel like a gathering storm, a painful presence for the young woman Maxim marries after Rebecca's death. Although du Maurier gave the second Mrs. de Winter an inner life of extraordinary richness and depth, the author did not give her a name. When I learned that she didn\u2019t have a name, I gave her mine, and she became me. I think she is simply every romantic woman who ever read this remarkable novel. Rebecca, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is also my favorite film. Joan Fontaine brilliant as the second Mrs. de Winter; Laurence Olivier absolute perfection as Max. This film was released in 1940, so don't see it in a theatre filled with college students, because they will snicker in the wrong places and spoil the most poignant scenes for you."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james", "userReview": "4 stars to Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca.

It's officially been two months since I actually finished a book, and it's been longer than that since I reviewed one. I almost forgot what it feels like to come to the last page of a book, read it, exhale slowly, and put the book down gently with that small spark of accomplishment raging deep inside you. Plus, the whole post-book sandwich thing that I've mentioned somewhere before and, again, may not be a real thing. So, Rebecca... wow. It took me a month to read it because I started it in the midst of my yearly book slump. I put it down for a while, not because it sucked, but because books in general were just not doing it for me at that time in my life. I think this is a safe place to share that. Maybe you read all the time, nonstop, couldn't think of ever slowing down. That's awesome. I, on the other hand, set goals I can't accomplish and find myself too easily distracted by other stuff sometimes. Anyway, for all of y'all out there in a similar situation where you're Netflixin' and chillin' or playing video games or enjoying the summer outside somewhere, and you come back to books like \"Damn, I don't feel like reading and nothing even sounds good because right now I have some very specific needs of what I want a book to do to me and nothing is going to fit into these ridiculous categories I've outlined for myself plus I don't even really have time right now and the new season of Game of Thrones is starting soon...\"If you're feeling any of that, go grab a copy of Rebecca somewhere and relax. As I'm writing this review, I'm relaxing with a Community Mosaic IPA because 1) IPAs are awesome 2) this one is one of my local favorites and 3) I'm a hipster. Relax. Start reading Rebecca. Let it intoxicate you too many sips of a local IPA. From the very beginning, the writing is amazing. It never lets up either. Every scene, every character, every event... they are al painted so beautifully and methodically. Sometimes you'll find yourself caught up in the suspense, and then a long paragraph describing the room interrupts, but it's just so sexy and feels so important that you don't even care. You don't even feel interrupted. It all feels necessary. I took my time with the book early on, but gee whiz man I didn't drop the book much during the second half. I don't want to talk about the plot really, but the book did go places I wasn't expecting in a great way. There's a slow, suspenseful build that hangs in the air, and by the end you have to keep moving quickly as things unravel because it doesn't let up until the last page. Whew!!I learned recently that Hitchcock directed the movie which makes perfect sense. If you like Hitchcock, you should enjoy this one. If you like good, well-written, slow-burning mysteries, this is for you. If you are a human with eyes or ears functioning well enough to take in the words written in these pages, this is for you. Highly recommended. Kicked me right out of my slump and reminded me books are awesome. And, I get to enjoy a fantastic sandwich today! Happy Independence Day, America!!Update 7/9/17: The Hitchcock movie gets 5 stars, too. Check it out."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "603.\tRebecca, Daphne du Maurier (1907 - 1989)Rebecca is a thriller novel by English author Dame Daphne du Maurier.

around, as compared to the first time I read this book several years ago. Here's the key: This is not a romance novel. It's a psychological suspense novel. As I reread Rebecca with this in mind, I had a much greater appreciation for its artistry, the way Daphne du Maurier skillfully used words to create a mood and increase the suspense.We can never go back again, that much is certain. The past is still close to us. The things we have tried to forget and put behind us would stir again, and that sense of fear, of furtive unrest, struggling at length to blind unreasoning panic - now mercifully stilled, thank God - might in some manner unforeseen become a living companion as it had before.The narrator, a young and painfully self-conscious girl, is a paid companion to Mrs. Van Hopper, a snobbish social climber. While they are in Monte Carlo, Mrs. Van Hopper bulldozes her way into an acquaintance with a quiet widower, Maxim de Winter. Despite our heroine's lack of status and social graces, Maxim begins spending time with her and soon asks her to marry him. Desperately in love with him, she does so, despite the vast differences in their ages, wealth, status ... just about everything. And despite his frequent rudeness and mockery of her.After a too-brief honeymoon, they return to England and Maxim's lovely country estate, Manderley, presided over by the skeletal housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who instantly takes a dislike to the new Mrs. de Winter. Mrs. Danvers does her best to undercut the main character's lack of confidence in every way possible, but mostly by holding up Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, as an impossible standard of beauty, taste and accomplishment, a standard that the second can never hope to reach.The second wife becomes more and more haunted by this paragon, Rebecca, even though there are clues in the things Maxim, his sister and others say - and don't say - that maybe there is more to Rebecca's character than the second wife realizes.I found it fascinating how du Maurier tells you the end in the beginning, in such a way that it doesn't spoil the story at all, but adds to the underlying tension and sense of oppression. The second Mrs. de Winter thinks they are contented, and perhaps they are, but they are deeply damaged as well, living a sort of half-life. Mrs. Danvers is quite the character: one wonders how much her presence in Rebecca's childhood influenced the person Rebecca became. And Rebecca herself ... well, without getting into spoiler territory, she has an amazing presence in this novel for someone who's dead before it even starts.I have to say that the second Mrs. de Winter's paralyzing lack of self-confidence and her gaucherie, even though integral to the plot, was really irksome to me. And every time she'd start off into another daydream, which she did All. The. Time., imagining conversations and events out of whole cloth, I would mentally roll my eyes at her. But once I realized that this is not to be read as a romance novel (really, the relationship here is pretty unhealthy on both sides), I was free to appreciate the characters' shortcomings (instead of being frustrated by them) and to see how those shortcomings and their past experiences combine to bring them together, but pull them apart at the same time. It's a fascinating psychological study.My rating has gone from 3, to 4, to 5 stars. It's a book that has really stuck with me. Between the well-drawn, seriously flawed characters, the brooding atmosphere, with a feeling that disaster is just waiting for the right moment to strike, and the great plot twists, Rebecca is deservedly a classic in its genre. Buddy read with the Reading For Pleasure book club, April 2016.Initial comments:I read Rebecca maybe 15 or 20 years ago and didn't really care for it back then. I'm not entirely sure now of the reasons why, but I think it may have been that I was expecting more of a romance with some nice happy feels at the end? So now that my expectations have been adjusted, we're going to give this another shot."}, {"userName": "Nayra.Hassan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2015", "userURL":

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-jean", "userReview": "\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.\" This beautiful first line is instantly recognisable, and has passed into our culture. Like all great openings it captures our imagination and makes us want to read more. The rhythm is insistent, the mention of dreams intrigues us and the word \"Manderley\" echoes somewhere in our subconscious. We are already in danger of falling under Daphne Du Maurier's hypnotic spell.Generally regarded as Daphne du Maurier's masterpiece, Rebecca has never been out of print since it was first published in 1938 - a comparatively early novel. A tempestuous gothic romance, it was an immediate success, making its author into a household name. The story of the mysterious, glamorous ex-wife, the mousy replacement, the brooding and brusque Maxim de Winter and all the intrigue and drama which circle around these three characters is too well-known to need repeating in precis here.Rebecca captured the feel of the age, drawing on the glamour of country society and the feeling of impending catastrophe that permeated the pre-war years. Du Maurier knew this society well, having been born into a wealthy family in London in 1907. She herself was a tomboy as a child however, and much preferred visiting the family's holiday home of Ferryside, to participating in London society. All these threads of her life, and many others, come together in this masterly novel. Many people love its high romanticism, but Daphne du Maurier became irritated over the years with people calling it a romantic novel. She insisted that it was in part \"a study in jealousy\" and also a depiction of a powerful man and a weak woman.Our first introduction to Manderley comes when the narrator is also approaching the estate for the first time. It is an ominous journey, laden with foreboding,\"This drive twisted and turned as a serpent, scarce wider in places than a path, and above our heads was a great colonnade of trees, whose branches nodded and intermingled with each other... Even the midday sun would not penetrate the interlacing of those green leaves, they were too thickly entwined, one with another.\"The mood continues with the first glimpse of the great house itself, with rhododendrons against a \"blood-red wall.\" The apprehensive narrator refers to the \"slaughterous red, luscious and fantastic.\"Later though, Manderley seems to have exerted a different influence over the viewpoint character. She has a far calmer view, describing,\"a thing of beauty, exquisite and faultless, lovelier even than I had ever dreamed, built in its hollow of smooth grassland and mossy lawns, the terraces sloping to the gardens, and the gardens to the sea.\"And a few hours later, when events turn and seem to come crashing down about her ears, the mood switches again. She looks through the window observing,\"a hurrying cloud hid the sun for a moment as I watched, and the sea changed colour instantly, becoming black, and the white crests were then very pitiless suddenly, and cruel.\" The extraordinary and magnificent creation of \"Manderley\" was inspired in the main by Menabilly, a house the author had known about for many years. Menabilly had been empty for 20 years; it was totally covered with ivy and in a terrible state of decay at this time, but Du Maurier was determined to to live there one day. She had taken her three young children trespassing in the grounds a couple of years earlier, and apparently they all peered through the broken windows as she kissed the house and told them it was her favourite place. The family were living in \"Ferryside\", in Fowey, about four miles away. She did subsequently manage to lease Menabilly for 20 years, arranging all the renovations herself and the family moved there. It came as a great shock to her when many years later as an old woman she was told to leave the house she loved. But that is another story.The actual setting of Manderley also mirrors the setting of Menabilly, which is hidden away in the woods by the Gribbin Head outside Fowey. Manderley has such presence in the novel that the reader senses it more as a character than a place. In fact in many of Du Maurier's works places are more important than people. While she was in Egypt, she had even confessed to missing Menabilly more than her two children. Her husband, a commanding officer in the Grenadier Guards, was stationed in Alexandria, and this is where she wrote the first rough draft of Rebecca. In 1937 she returned home - not to Menabilly yet, but to \"Ferryside\", which the Du Maurier family bought in the 1920's, and which is still the family home to this day.Manderley was also partly based on Milton Hall in Cambridgeshire, which Du Maurier visited in her youth. It was here she conceived the character of Mrs Danvers, after seeing a tall dark housekeeper there. The insidiously malevolent character of Mrs Danvers is an extraordinary creation, with her white \"skull's face\" and her obsession with Rebecca. Another twisted, tortured and essentially broken character, who nevertheless exercises a powerful hold over weaker personalities,\"I shall never forget the expression on her face, loathsome, triumphant. The face of an exulting devil. She stood there, smiling at me.\"Du Maurier drew many other aspects of the novel from her own life, in addition to the wonderful depiction of Manderley, and the the grotesquerie of Mrs Danvers. The seed of the story lay in Daphne Du Maurier's jealousy of Jan Ricardo, the first fianc\u00e9e of her husband. And who apparently signed \"Jan Ricardo\" with a dramatic great R - a portentous curlicue that is emulated in the book,\"The name Rebecca stood out black and strong, the tall and sloping R dwarfing the other letters.\" And elsewhere,  \"That bold, slanting hand, stabbing the white paper, the symbol of herself, so certain, so assured.\"Jan Ricardo later threw herself under a train, and it is said that the author was haunted by the suspicion that her husband remained attracted to Ricardo.Daphne Du Maurier herself was notoriously shy and withdrawn. She writes herself into the story as the unconfident narrator. The fact that this viewpoint character is nameless and almost anonymous has always intrigued readers of the novel. The most obvious interpretation is that the second timid Mrs de Winter had such a low self-image that she becomes a mere shadow. The truth is rather more prosaic. Du Maurier couldn't think what to call the character at first, and so she didn't call her anything. As the novel progressed it became a challenge. And at some point presumably, she realised that the lack of a name cleverly symbolised the character's lack of self-worth. We do know that the narrator is \"not yet 21\", as a contrast to Maxim's given age of 42, and she went to a fairly well-to-do boarding school. We even have glimpses of the narrator's name, which tempts us to believe that at some point it may be revealed to us. There is a reference early on to her name on an envelope being spelled correctly; that it is a rare occurrence. And Maxim says, \"You have a very lovely and unusual name... it becomes you as well as it became your father.\" (An oblique reference here perhaps, to the author's own father, the actor Gerald Du Maurier, whom she idolised and who in turn viewed Daphne as his favourite daughter.)Alfred Hitchcock memorably made an Oscar-winning film of Rebecca in 1940. His casting of Laurence Olivier, who immortalised the moody figure of Maxim, was perfect in Du Maurier's opinion. Her overall view of the film may not have been quite so favourable, however. Subsequent versions tend to stay closer to the plot, but in this initial film, Daphne Du Maurier's ending was considered far too shocking and \"immoral\" for the audiences of the time, with the perpetrator of a serious crime escaping justice, and so it was changed. Olivier himself had originally wanted Vivien Leigh to play opposite him, but in the event, Joan Fontaine proved a much better choice as the na\u00efve insecure second Mrs de Winter. Interestingly, in the Hitchcock film, the whole crew called her \"Daphne\" on the shoot, although the character is written as \"I\" in the script. Hitchcock's was the start of many dramatisations and adaptations of the novel; its popularity continues even now. There has even, perhaps surprisingly, been a musical, an overblown pantomime-styled adaptation by all accounts, where Mrs Danvers was \"boooed\" every time she came on to the stage.Maxim de Winter, viewed through the eyes of the woman who loves him, is an enigmatic character. He is portrayed much on the lines of Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy in \"Pride and Prejudice\", or Mr Rochester in \"Jane Eyre\". In fact Rebecca is heavily in debt to \"Jane Eyre\", with one crucial dramatic scene at the end lifted in its entirety. Maxim de Winter has all the desirable features of a typical masculine Victorian hero; he is handsome, heroic, but also very irritable. His proposal of marriage to his second wife consists in him snapping out the words, \"I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool\". Essentially he is a haunted and very private character. The narrator despairs, as he calls her \"my sweet child\" or \"my good child\" when he particularly wants to patronise or scold her. On one occasion she notes gloomily, \"The smile was my reward. Like a pat on the head for Jasper. Good dog then, lie down, don't worry me any more.\"On another, Maxim says to her, \"You had a twist to your mouth and a flash of knowledge in your eyes. Not the right sort of knowledge... Listen my sweet... a husband is not so very different from a father after all. There is a certain type of knowledge I prefer you not to have.\"This type of writing is difficult and uncomfortable for the modern reader to accept. Actually, such jarring notes are much more noticable in Du Maurier's novels where the viewpoint character is female. The author said herself that she felt much more comfortable writing male characters. She even went so far as to say that she felt herself to be a man in a woman's body.Nevertheless, even though in general female characters are possibly not portrayed as convincingly as male ones in Du Maurier's stories, in this particular case it does work. Rebecca is a highly charged novel, and such portrayals and attitudes need to be viewed as being within the mores and context of this type of novel, observing its conventions. It is essentially a gothic melodrama, redolent with grotesque characters such as Mrs Danvers, and to a lesser degree the appalling Mrs Van Hopper, the shallow spoilt wealthy woman to whom the second Mrs de Winter was a companion at the start of the novel. And as such, it also contains as a counter-weight, the sort of heroes and heroines we might also associate with a previous century, \"They suffered because they could not break out from their own web of shyness and reserve, and in their blindness and folly built up a great distorted wall in front of them that hid the truth.\"The relationship between the couple we are following is consistent with this period feel. It is very uneven and exaggerated, with the viewpoint character being completely tongue-tied with him, and increasingly cowed and made neurotic by her perception of her predecessor. She could talk to his legal advisor Frank Crawley, or his sister Beatrice, about Rebecca, with no such qualms. But not with her husband,\"He did not belong to me at all, he belonged to Rebecca. He still thought about Rebecca. He would never love me because of Rebecca. She was in the house still... and in the garden...her footsteps sounded in the corridors, her scent lingered on the stairs... Rebecca was still mistress of Manderley. Rebecca was still Mrs de Winter. I had no business here at all... Rebecca, always Rebecca.\"\"I could fight the living but I could not fight the dead...Rebecca would never grow old. Rebecca would always be the same. And her I could not fight. She was too strong for me.\"The oppressive timbre of the novel shifts. Sometimes the threat is such as this, a sense of Rebecca; sometimes Mrs Danvers. Other times it is Manderley itself. And sometimes the sensations are blended, so that Manderley and Mrs Danvers almost become one. At other times, the narrator has moments of happiness, such as this time, shortly before a fancy dress ball, full of optimism at the exciting forthcoming event. She describes Manderley thus,\"the drawing-room, formal and cold to my consideration when we were alone, was a blaze of colour... and the hall itself wore a strange waiting air, there was a warmth about it I had never known before...The old austerity had gone. Manderley had come alive in a fashion I would not have believed possible. It was not the still quiet Manderley I knew. There was a certain significance about it now that had not been before. A reckless air, rather triumphant, rather pleasing. It was as if the house remembered other days, long long ago.\" Yet later, when events had taken a dramatic turn for the worse,\"The tall shrubs looked dark and drab now that the colour had gone. A fog was rolling up from the sea and I could not see the woods beyond the bank. It was very hot, very oppressive...The sun had gone in now beyond a wall of mist. It was as though a blight had fallen upon Manderley taking the sky away and the light of day... The dark trees loomed thin and indistinct... The mist in the trees had turned to moisture and dripped upon my bare head like a thin rain. The clammy oppression of the day... the sea, sullen and slow\"Rebecca is a true classic. The overwhelming aura of, \"Rebecca with her beauty, her charm, her breeding,\" permeates the entire book. Yet Rebecca never appears. Not once. It is unique of its kind. Not only because of that, but also because \"Rebecca\" is ostensibly the heroine of the book; its title character. She makes her presence felt solely through the narrator - who had never even met her. It is a book which can be read on many levels, and is open to different interpretations, as many great works are. Take the opening sentence, whose hypnotic rhythm I referred to at the start of this review. Have you noticed the structure? It is an iambic hexameter (there are 6 lengths - 6 \"di-dahs\") which along with the iambic pentameter (5 lengths) is often used in English poetry and plays. Was this deliberate? Was it subliminal? For a moment I wondered if the author's own name, \"Daphne Du Maurier\" becomes an iambic hexameter if you double it up. To echo that would perfectly demonstrate to me how much of herself she puts into her novels. But in fact it becomes a dactylic tetrameter (the dactylic poetic foot being one stressed followed by two unstressed ie \"dum-di-di\".\"Tetrameter\" simply means four poetic feet, so four lots of \"dum-di-di\"s.) Nevertheless, to use such a structure shows her feelings and deep love for poetic language. The are myriads of details which can be analysed and seen as portents. Take the instance of Beatrice's wedding present to the new bride - a set of books. They fall, due to the viewpoint character's clumsiness, thus breaking a small cupid ornament - which itself was a wedding present to the first Mrs de Winter. Here the symbolism is overt. The are two \"paths\" which the narrator can take - both figuratively and literally. One is called \"Happy Valley\", the other...well here is a description of that one,\"There is no sense of beauty in this undergrowth. That tangle of shrubs there should be cut down to bring light to the path. It was dark much too dark. That naked eucalyptus tree stifled by branches looked like the white bleached limb of a skeleton, and there was a black earthy stream running beneath it, choked with the muddied rains of years, trickling silently to the beach below. The birds did not sing here as they did in the valley. It was quiet in a different way.\"Here the author switches between present and past to increase a sense of unease. In other parts of the novel she will use extremely short sentences - not even complete sentences in some cases - to heighten the mood and add a jerkiness and breathlessness to a dramatic situation. There is a very marked instance of this about two thirds the way through the novel after a big \"reveal\". It is a highly charged emotional episode, and after this the characters behave in a slightly different way, both towards each other and to everyone else, because of their experience.In certain descriptive passages Du Maurier's language is extremely poetic. The feeling that Manderley is a character rather than just a building, garden and estate was touched on earlier in this review. Manderley is overwhelmingly an organic presence. Much use is made of the pathetic fallacy throughout the novel. Nature is always described as taking on the attributes and feelings of the person experiencing it. Is this deliberate too? Or merely a reflection of what the author felt - her passionate reaction to her beloved Nature in all its apparent moods; Cornwall's unpredictable sea, the cliffs, the gardens and the house.This quote is typical of the overall feeling of threat and tension in this novel,\"The weather had not broken yet. It was still hot, oppressive. The air was full of thunder and there was rain behind the white dull sky, but it did not fall. I could feel it, and smell it, pent up there, behind the clouds.\"This fifth novel really established Daphne Du Maurier's name. Yet it could be argued that she was still to write her best works. \"My Cousin Rachel\" for instance, her thirteenth major work dating from 1951, has a very similar feel and employs many of the same literary devices. I personally feel she has honed her skills to an even greater and subtler level with that one. (Here is a link to my review of it.) However, whatever you judge to be the case as regards literary worth, this is a compelling book which once read is never forgotten. Daphne Du Maurier has invested a great deal of herself in this novel - her personality, her own obsessions and her experiences. It is an excellent read on any level, with tension, high drama, intrigue and tragedy. There are a couple of very ingenious twists. And the characters and places have cunningly filtered their way into the public's consciousness as those in all great works do."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "\"I dreamt I went to Manderley again.\"Rebecca is the story of a young woman (her first name is never given) who marries wealthy Maxim de Winter, mostly to escape her life as a companion to a rich American woman. She moves with her new husband to his estate, Manderly, where she learns about her husband's previous wife, Rebecca. Although Rebecca drowned in the ocean near the house over a year ago, the house is still full of her prescence. Her old room is cleaned daily, and is left exactly the way it was when Rebecca still lived there. Her servant, the creepy and completely evil Mrs. Danvers, is still loyal to Rebecca, and the new Mrs. de Winter finds herself being compared to Rebecca by everyone she encounters. Over the course of the story, the narrator begins to inquire into Rebecca's past with her husband in an attempt to discover how she was able to captivate everyone she knew. As the story progresses, Mrs. de Winter discovers that not everyone at Manderley has been completely honest with her, and Rebecca herself is at the heart of all these secrets.I really liked this book. Its plot was similar to Jane Eyre, but unlike Bronte, du Maurier doesn't reveal her biggest plot twist three-quarters of the way through the story - in Rebecca, the surprises keep coming until literally the last page, making it a much more enjoyable read. I also enjoyed the main character - she's clumsy and not very confident, but there's strength at her core, and this fact placed me on her side, despite her very human imperfections."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "Rebecca is just a great story that never gets old.

His face too revealing, showing the tragic situation he must face. A young lady half his age, is working for the implacable, unfeeling American, Mrs. Van Hopper, a middle aged woman, as a paid companion, servant and punching bag. Two souls, Max and the girl, who need comfort, happiness and yes, love, in this brutal world, they find each other and hope arrives. A quick marriage (Mrs.Van Hopper is amazed), a short honeymoon in Venice, and they're back after a few weeks, in their native England, the wild coast, of Cornwall, in the southwest of the country, far from busy, noisy, polluted, London. A quiet, hidden place, clean, too, where nothing occurs, enormous Manderley, centuries old, the home of the de Winter's family, for many generations, surrounded by thick, impenetrable woods, exotic flowers, exquisite butterflies playing in the air, beautiful green lawns, colorful birds singing sweetly, the fragrant winds blowing from the nearby sea, fishing boats traversing the horizon. Mrs.Danvers the evil looking housekeeper, the Keeper of the Flame, takes an immediate dislike of the second Mrs. de Winter, how can such a timid, uneducated, unlovely girl, take over for Rebecca? The bold, intelligent beauty, the prettiest woman in the area, Rebecca, loved by all. There are disturbing secrets kept deep in Manderley, where the bride often loses her way, not spoken about by the servants and friends of Maxim, he often disappears into himself, what is he thinking about, Rebecca?

Sometimes I forget, buried under stacks of entertaining but often poorly written popular fiction. At first, Rebecca is very reminiscent of another favorite book of mine - Jane Eyre. The main character is a young, innocent, poor girl who falls in love with a rich older man. The happiness is so near, but the shadow of the man's first wife stands in the way of it. A family secret, a haunted mansion, a deranged servant, and a fire are also major players in the story. I've said it before, I personally don't mind borrowed themes, but only if done right. A talented writer can reinterpret and reinvent an old story, add new layers to it, and Daphne du Maurier does just that. The book is beautifully written, it is haunting, it is suspenseful.I also think it takes a gifted writer to make readers get attached to a character as insecure, jealous, and timid as the second Mrs. de Winter. Daphne du Maurier succeeds once more. The main character is very compelling and her fears are palpable. I found myself sharing the heroines insecurities (after all, why shouldn't she question her husband's feelings toward her if he treats her like a child, a pet and doesn't make an effort to let her know where he stands in regard to his first wife?), being scared of and intimidated by Mrs. Danvers, and taunted by the memories of the first (possibly superior) wife. Rebecca is simply a great book all around, deservedly a masterpiece of English literature and from now on - a new favorite love story of mine, to be treasured and kept near Gone With the Wind, Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice, Wuthering Heights, and The Thorn Birds."}, {"userName": "Luca Ambrosino", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53478239-luca-ambrosino", "userReview": "English (Rebecca) / Italiano\u00abLast night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\u00bbManderley, an estate located in southern England, is the absolute protagonist of this novel. Owned by the rich widower Maxim De Winter, it is a place known across England, especially thanks to his first wife Rebecca, now deceased. During her married life, in fact, Rebecca turned Manderly into a center of social life and entertainment. A place on everyone's lips.But now Rebecca is gone, died in a shipwreck, and this tragic passing contributed to turn her into a celestial figure, invaluable in the eyes of the people who attended Manderley. For this reason, when Maxim de Winter decides to get married again, his new partner constantly suffers for the comparison with Rebecca. Too much for the lady to handle. Rebecca was sublime, while she is a simple and naive girl. It is not without reason that the new bride has no name, in the sense that in the novel she is never mentioned with her name. Literally we don't know her name, despite being the main character, to underline the depersonalization of the new wife. And Maxim says late in the game:\u00abRebecca won\u00bbIn one way or another, Rebecca always wins.Vote: 8\u00abSognai l'altra notte che ritornavo a Manderley\u00bbManderley, tenuta situata nel sud dell'Inghilterra, \u00e8 la assoluta protagonista di questo romanzo. Di propriet\u00e0 del ricco vedovo Maxim De Winter, \u00e8 un luogo noto in tutta l'Inghilterra, soprattutto grazie a Rebecca, la sua prima moglie, ormai deceduta.

Un luogo sulla bocca di tutti.Ma Rebecca non c'\u00e8 pi\u00f9, scomparsa in un naufragio, e questo tragico trapasso ha contribuito ad innalzarla a figura celestiale, inarrivabile agli occhi della gente che ha frequentato Manderley. Per questo, quando Maxim de Winter decide di sposarsi nuovamente, la sua nuova compagna subisce continuamente il confronto con Rebecca. E non lo regge. Rebecca era sublime, mentre lei \u00e8 semplice, ingenua. Non a caso la nuova sposa non ha nome, nel senso che letteralmente non viene mai nominata col suo nome di battesimo nel romanzo, pur essendo il personaggio principale, a sottolinearne la spersonalizzazione.

Her constant ruminations and daydreams really set the tone it's a real trip getting to be inside her head with all her naive neurotic thoughts, which often get carried away and make for a compelling read.It follows the main (unnamed) character when she moves to Manderley with her new husband, from the beginning she is aware that she lives in the shadow of the former mistress of Manderley...Rebecca. Although Rebecca is dead it appears that her shadow is everywhere, her haunting presence becomes a nightmare for the new Mrs de Winter. The plot thickens and there is a little twist added. Oh and how I loved the wonderful vivid descriptions of Manderley, the dark gloomy gothic setting, it's all wonderfully evocative and the slow sinister mood that creeps in is just delicious. The ending also for me was spot on. I'm so glad I finally got around to reading this book and know why it's considered such a classic! 5 fun creepy stars!!"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18894476-sarah", "userReview": "Updated review ......This is a classic book that I've had on my \"to read\" list for a long time. I don't usually read novels in this genre (romance). But this book offers more than romance... it is also a murder mystery. I understand Alfred Hitchcock made this into a movie many years ago but I did not see it. Therefore, I was unaware of the story's plot and how it unfolds.du Maurier does a fine job with this as \"mystery\".. I especially liked how the protagonist/ narrator (the second Mrs. DeWinter) is revealed, first as a timid & self-effacing woman who over time finds her stride as the second Mrs. DeWinter and as the mistress of Manderley, the country estate of her husband Maxim deWinter. du Maurier's choice not to give the second Mrs. DeWinter a first name is an intriguing aspect of the story... and underscores the feelings of worthlessness experienced by the second Mrs. deWinter. A main source for these feelings is the perception that the first Mrs. deWinter (Rebecca) excelled in many things (famous beauty, devoted wife & perfect hostess) that the second Mrs. deWinter could not live up to. As the story unfolds, it is clear that Rebecca was not, indeed, as perceived, I gave this 5 stars ... I had to resort to an audio book for this one because the hardback I ordered from Amazon had writing that was so tiny I couldn't read it. Luckily the narrator was fantastic I can't wait to read another book of equal quality.Why have I not read this book before now? It's amazing. I loved everything about it !"}, {"userName": "Lora", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4632071-lora", "userReview": "[There is an exchange between our heroine and the resentful Mrs. Danvers about 2/3 of the way through the novel. During this discussion Mrs. Danvers informs our lead that while alive Rebecca had many male companions with whom she was physically intimate. Now, my first thought after reading that was, How, then, could Maxim mourn her to the degree that he does? How could he be so torn about her death if she cheated on him numerous times during their marriage? Well, it was because all was not what it seemed. When Maxim confesses to having killed Rebecca, I LITERALLY fell out of my seat. Granted, I let myself do so. But it was so shocking I just let myself go like a slinky. It was insane. The whole time I'm thinking that Maxim will never give up Rebecca even though she is dead, that Maxim and his new wife don't have any real chance of ever being happy because, apparently, Rebecca was just too wonderful! for anyone to compare to her. Ha! Ha! HAHAHA!! You can see that it has decreased my sanity a little. I just couldn't believe it! That revelation meant that every paling of the face on Maxim's part, every look of worry or dread was only because he had killed her, not because he was sick over her death. Gah! I shall never get over the brilliancy of this Epic Twist for as long as I live. Truly.

Once, twice or no longer remember the numbers like me!! What!!! You have never read it!!!!! If there is one book that one has to read, this is the one. First published in April 1938, (it has never been out of print) it still remains an amazing and \u201ccurrent\u201d read today, which grabs you one of the most famous and memorable sentences ever written.The padlocked gate opens and you follow the long drive when you suddenly \u2013 Manderley\u2026\u2026..a silent and dark house filled with secrets\u2026 I came upon it suddenly; the approach masked by the unnatural growth of a vast shrub that spread in all directions . . . There was Manderley, our Manderley, secretive and silent as it had always been, the gray stone shining in the moonlight of my dream, the mullioned windows reflecting the green lawns and terrace. Time could not wreck the perfect symmetry of those walls, nor the site itself, a jewel in the hollow of a hand.A young woman working as a rich woman\u2019s companion meets a mature and rich Englishman in Monte Carlo. She agrees to marry him after a quick courtship and he then takes her to his home, Manderley, where the presence of his dead wife, Rebecca, still lives and kept alive by the evil and manipulative housekeeper, Mrs Danvers. You wouldn't think she'd been gone so long, would you? Sometimes, when I walk along the corridor, I fancy I hear her just behind me. That quick light step, I couldn't mistake it anywhere. It's not only in this room, it's in all the rooms in the house. I can almost hear it now. Do you think the dead come back and watch the living? \u201cWhy don't you go? Why don't you leave Manderley? He doesn't need you... he's got his memories. He doesn't love you, he wants to be alone again with her. You've nothing to stay for. You've nothing to live for really, have you?\u201dWhy don't you go? We none of us want you. He doesn't want you, he never did. He can't forget her. He wants to be alone in the house again, with her. It's you that ought to be lying there in the church crypt, not her. It's you who ought to be dead, not Mrs. de Winter. Mrs Danvers is an unforgettable villainess\u2026.she glides down the passages, silently and malevolently Mrs. Danvers to the present Mrs de Winter\u2026.\u201d Go ahead. Jump. He never loved you, so why go on living? Jump and it will all be over...\u201d Brilliant writing, a story of romance, suspense, guilt, secrets,  Her shadow between us all the time. Her damned shadow keeping us from one another. How could I hold you like this, my darling, my little love, with the fear always in my heart that this would happen? I remembered her eyes as she looked at me before she died. I remembered that slow treacherous smile. She knew this would happen even then. She knew she would win in the end.  loss of innocence  I can't forget what it has done to you. I was looking at you, thinking of nothing else all through lunch. It's gone forever, that funny, young, lost look that I loved. It won't come back again. I killed that too, when I told you about Rebecca. It's gone, in twenty-four hours. You are so much older...  The road to Manderley lay ahead. There was no moon. The sky above our heads was inky black. But the sky on the horizon was not dark at all. It was shot with crimson, like a splash of blood. My favorite quote in this book, which has stayed with me since I first read this book many years ago is Other quotes which I have always found so incredible \u201cHappiness is not a possession to be prized, it is a quality of thought, a state of mind.\u201d \u201cBoredom is a pleasing antidote for fear\u201d \u201cI suppose sooner or later in the life of everyone comes a moment of trial. We all of us have our particular devil who rides us and torments us, and we must give battle in the end.\u201d And the last line in the book.....unbelievably amazing...And the ashes blew towards us with the salt wind from the sea.If you haven\u2019t read Rebecca, I urge you to start page 1 right now. It will stay with you forever!!!"}, {"userName": "Samadrita", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita", "userReview": "[Getting murdered after contracting a terminal illness.

so deafening to hear the outer world, their thoughts are preoccupied and hearts laden with lunacy, weaving far-fetched stories about things that never happened, dreading the callousness of the day that will never come, desperately trying to hold on things that were never theirs to begin with, their heads, a battlefield of the debate of \u201cto be, or not to be\u201d\u2026.and their life? Ahh! A misery\u2026.As I was reading this deservingly classic of Daphne, I was rendered dumbfounded to know the narrator of story, I felt her, the gibberish talk she made, the imaginary conversations she constructed, the stories she weaved, the presuppositional element of her nature, the naivety in seeing things and believing them to be the way they looked, the desperation to make things right and in that haste, making them unrepair -ably wrong\u2026.They say the story is a resounding of Daphne\u2019s own life, she has invested so much of her into it, and even the enigmatic absence of the very name of the narrator, the second Mrs. de winter has its own acclaim to be Daphne du Maurrier herself. Her husband had a fianc\u00e9 with a name starting with capital \u201cR\u201d same as \u2018Rebecca\u2019 of our story, it is said Daphne remained suspicious of her whole life of him, belonging to the fianc\u00e9 heartily, who crushed herself under a train\u2026. Manderely,a character more than a place has its own charms and alarms. The Gothic air throughout the story keeps the senses of reader alert and anticipating something apparently with no link to the events themselves as the story progresses, I was sold by the beauty of her craft, and ingenuousness of the plot ,It truly has stand the test of time, Rebecca the nightmare of the narrator,Rebecca the woman loved by many and married by one, Rebecca the kind and cruel who haunts the narrator is the inheritor of so many classics of this genre..For the ever brooding champ Max,I didn\u2019t like the way he treated our narrator, more like a child than a wife, more like Jasper the dog than a human with heart and flesh, he could simply go to her, confide in her every bit of nagging thoughts he was wrestling with, he could damn trust her! We never want to be loved, as much as we want to be trusted!And the lines say her mind:\"He did not belong to me at all, he belonged to Rebecca. He still thought about Rebecca. He would never love me because of Rebecca. She was in the house still... and in the garden...her footsteps sounded in the corridors, her scent lingered on the stairs... Rebecca was still mistress of Manderley. Rebecca was still Mrs de Winter. I had no business here at all... Rebecca, always Rebecca......\"Well,I could go for 3 star rating, it was so slow paced, even her mind-talks prolonged to make you curse under-breath,murder of a woman is just normalized and Law is mocked for being sticked-to-evidence, and other more things....But 5 stars\u2026a tribute to Lady who lived!"}, {"userName": "Iris P", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2641948-iris-p", "userReview": "Rebecca\nEvery year I promise myself that I will include some literary classics in my reading list and every year I fail miserably. 2016 was no exception, although in my defense I wasn't very engaged in reading for a good part of it. But I digress.Going by many comments I've read in Goodreads, it seems that Rebecca is one of those \"aspirational\" books that live perennially in our to-read shelves but that many of us never actually read. I am not sure what finally prod me to get out of my comfort zone and give it a try. But whatever the reason, what I found was that for years I have had this treasure of a novel available and awaiting to be enjoyed and discovered. Reading it gave me the same sense of elation you get when you find that $20.00 bill inside the pocket of a pair of jeans, a delightful and welcome surprise!\n\nAn old cover of Rebecca\nSo I am a woman on a mission and my job is to convince at least a few of those readers who had been reluctant or simply not curious enough to read this classic, to find out why, almost 80 years since its original publication it remains such a captivating mystery. Here are my thoughts (along with some advice) on why I think any booklover should consider reading this novel:\n\n Rebecca has aged well\n\n:One of the reasons I hesitate to read classic novels is a concern that the writing might sound stale or dated to my modern ears. I am happy to report that was certainly not the case with this story, on the contrary, du Maurier's writing surprised me in how accessible I found it. I would recommend Rebecca to anyone that enjoys mysteries in general, regardless of the time period. \n\nIt has a slow but mesmerizing plot and cadence\n\n:If like me, you read mostly contemporary fiction, be patient. This novel has a slow pace and the first few chapters are rather dreary, but as you anxiously await for the mystery to unravel, enjoy the masterful storytelling, the cleverly planted psychological clues and the wonderful character development. That slow build up you endured? It pays off handsomely at the end.\n\n\nRebecca's famous first line\n\n\n\nTry avoiding spoilers\n\n:It almost goes without saying but avoid reading reviews that reveal too much. I was glad I read this novel knowing virtually nothing about the plot, something that I think greatly enhanced the experience for me.\n\nHoly unreliable characters Batman!\n\nWe modern readers talk a lot (and sometimes complain) about unreliable characters, but oh boy, did du Maurier seemed to have relished playing around with our minds with this plot!I am not sure if the term had been coined at the time this book was published but to me Rebecca is the ultimate unreliable character and I mean that as a compliment.\n\nGothic yes, supernatural not so much\n\n:I started reading Rebecca a couple of times before and gave up just a few pages into it. I made the mistake of taking the references of ghosts and supernatural powers in a literal sense, yes there are some paranormal overtones and the story is a little macabre (it is a Gothic novel after all), but I think the language mostly reflects the parlance of the times.\n\nLots of great imagery\n\n:There's so much subtext in this novel you might think you are just reading too much between the lines. But honestly it is impossible to escape all the symbolism du Maurier incorporates into this storyline, both the real and metaphorical kind. The afterword included in the 2013 version I read clarified many of the questions I had and confirmed most of my \"sub-reading\". If anything I was struck by how much of du Maurier's psychological nuances I had missed.\n\nDhapne du Maurier - Was born in London in 1907 and died in 1989\nThere's a great Goodreads discussion thread from a few years ago in which readers debate what makes a novel a \nClassic\n. There are plenty of opinions on this topic, but I thought this reader's summarized it in a elegant and succinct way \"a classic is a novel that captures the feel of a generation without being limited to that generation\".I am far from committing myself to reading War and Peace or Ulysses anytime soon, but I will definitely be looking for more of these literary gems and I am keeping an open space on my (virtual) shelves to add a few more of those du Maurier engaging novels and I plan on making time to read them.Rebecca encompasses everything I expect to get in a great mystery novel, namely interesting characters and a clever plot, but also an enjoyable journey that leads to an unexpected but satisfying destination."}, {"userName": "Rincey", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/278339-rincey", "userReview": "Wowwww."}, {"userName": "Andrei B\u0103dic\u0103", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57321276-andrei-b-dic", "userReview": "5 STELE MARI!!!
