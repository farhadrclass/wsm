Then I saw Harvey Keitel. Intrigued, I continued to watch and was quickly enthralled. The film was, I would later learn, The Duelists, Ridley Scott\u2019s brilliant 1978 film. At the time, I did not even know the title of the show that I enjoyed so much, but later learned and saw the film again. Recently I learned that the film was based upon a short story by Joseph Conrad and I knew I had to read the novella. As I read, I could not help visualizing the scenes (renewed applause for the casting director) with Carradine as D\u2019Hubert and Keitel as Feraud.Conrad\u2019s work, titled The Point of Honor and published in 1908, equally good as Scott\u2019s film, is unusual for the Polish writer as it is neither a nautical tale nor one told from the perspective of the late 1800s. As much of a fan of Conrad\u2019s as I am, I must concede that many of his works are brooding and introspective, and move slowly, especially while he lays the foundations for his setting and characterizations. This one, also somewhat unusual for Conrad, moves fast and is filled with action. Set in Napoleon\u2019s army, it chronicles an ongoing vendetta between two Hussar officers and over a period of several years. Begun as an indolent, misunderstood duel, the two war against each other amidst the backdrop of Napoleon\u2019s truculent reign. One point that Conrad makes, and it stands clear throughout the narrative, is that the duel actually benefitted the two. The martial contest made each work and strive a little harder, made the will to survive and prevail in their personal contest as earnest as the will to live through the bloody Napoleonic war years. Both officers in Napoleon\u2019s army, and both \u201cmilitary to the bottom of the soul\u201d the duel invigorated both and revived them when their fortunes were down. Similarly, the two experienced an odd intimacy. They were not friends, but Conrad showed how, between two warriors, the adversary may be as close, or even closer, than family."}, {"userName": "Forrest", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/811928-forrest", "userReview": "Traveller was kind enough to point me to this tale of a pair of French duelists who meet several times regarding their \u201cpoint of honor\". Though I felt the beginning was rather long and seemed to drag on a bit, the story itself elicited more emotion out of me than I had expected. I\u2019ve often wondered what thoughts went through a man\u2019s head when he knew he was going to die in a duel, and Conrad does a great job of portraying just how one might feel, given those circumstances. Like any work of its time, there is more than a little melodrama when we peek into the characters\u2019 thoughts, but Conrad also shows surprising restraint, as well, in that his characters don\u2019t seem like they\u2019re overacting too much when presenting dialogue. There is a movie version of this story, directed by Ridley Scott (so it has to be pretty good, right?), that I will now have to see.As some might know, I fence, when I have the time (very rare nowadays), so I take particular interest in works about swords and swordsmanship. I\u2019ve written a story or two myself about the same. Most works are rather cursory in their accounts of the combat itself, and The Point of Honor is no exception. I suppose that Conrad might have learned how to wield a saber while in the Merchant Navy, though I\u2019m not sure of this.In any case, what stands out is not the descriptions of the fighting, but what the men are feeling (or not feeling) before, during, and after the fight. Of course, the duel itself is merely the reinforcement of cultural norms expressed through the use of arms. If I were smarter by half, I could go on about this, but suffice it to say that the duel, social expectations of French society at the time (read Balzac, if you want more on this), and the intensity of emotions felt by the characters throughout are all part of a self-perpetuating cycle. These two men are truly \u201ccaught up\" in events that lay beyond their control. But this sword, as they say, has two edges. By participating in the forbidden duel itself, the men kick against authority (all discreetly, of course) while, at the same time, reinforcing the social walls that forced them into this long, slow game of cat and mouse in the first place.Despite the seeming inevitability of the duelists\u2019 ongoing encounters, the end is a bit of a surprise and is quite satisfactory. Though there are other books about dueling that are much more thorough, none of them delve so deeply into what it means to be a human duelist."}, {"userName": "Rosenkavalier", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4551695-rosenkavalier", "userReview": "\"A perfect singleness of intention, a homicidal austerity of mood\" Se ben ricordo, nella sua biografia (Il mondo di ieri) Stefan Zweig scrive che Napoleone Bonaparte, dimostrando nei fatti le possibilit\u00e0 offerte dai tempi nuovi a un giovane coraggioso e ambizioso, per quanto di modeste origini, aveva causato una rivoluzione persino maggiore di quella di Robespierre, scatenando l\u2019entusiasmo di una o pi\u00f9 generazioni, fino ad allora represse dalle costrizioni di una rigida struttura sociale.Due ragazzi ambiziosi di quei tempi sono i protagonisti del racconto, due giovani tenenti della Grande Arm\u00e9e, Gabriel Feraud, collerico guascone figlio di un fabbro del sud, e Armand d\u2019Hubert, riflessivo borghese del nord, un po\u2019 incline alla malinconia.Iniziata da Feraud per un pretesto, la loro rivalit\u00e0 diventa leggendaria in tutto l\u2019esercito e terminer\u00e0 solo molto tempo dopo, dopo i Cento Giorni, la restaurazione e l\u2019esilio del Piccolo Caporale a S. Elena. Di mezzo, le tante campagne napoleoniche, dal trionfo di Austerlitz alla disastrosa ritirata dalla Russia. Un grande massacro che interrompe di tanto in tanto il massacro privato dei due Ussari.La fine della guerra non \u00e8 la fine della loro guerra, l\u2019irriducibile Feraud non accetta il confino impostogli come bonapartista e D\u2019Hubert, che ha accettato il nuovo-vecchio regime, si trover\u00e0 chiamato a un\u2019ultima, sorprendente resa dei conti.Ho pensato per un po\u2019 a cosa scrivere del racconto, che certo potrebbe essere letto come un\u2019allegoria della guerra in senso stretto, o della guerra tra istinto (Feraud) e ragione (D\u2019Hubert). Ripensando alla prefazione di Conrad al libro \u201cA set of six\u201d in cui \u00e8 raccolto, filosofeggiando mi sembrerebbe di fare torto all\u2019ironia e al \u201cself-restraint\u201d dell\u2019autore, quindi mi limito a riportare due frasi che non potrei comunque eguagliare per efficacia.Per Conrad, il racconto infatti sarebbe \u201cnulla pi\u00f9 che un serio, e persino (sic!) onesto, tentativo di realizzare un esempio di racconto storico\u201d (\u201cThe truth is that in my mind the story is nothing but a serious and even earnest attempt at a bit of historical fiction\u201d).In realt\u00e0 \u00e8 molto di pi\u00f9, un raffinatissimo, elegante, avvincente, spiazzante viaggio nel tempo, alla ricerca dello \u201cSpirito dell\u2019Epoca, mai semplicemente militarista pur nel lungo scontro armato, piena di giovent\u00f9, quasi infantile nella sua esaltazione del sentimento, genuinamente eroica nella sua fede\u201d (\u201cthe Spirit of the Epoch--never purely militarist in the long clash of arms, youthful, almost childlike in its exaltation of sentiment--naively heroic in its faith\u201d).Angolo multimediale: queste sono le illustrazioni originali della prima edizione del racconto, pubblicato come opera a s\u00e9 stante con il titolo \"The point of honor\".http://www.pinterest.com/rosenkavalie...Angolo cineforum: non penso sia necessario ricordare la splendida riduzione cinematografica di Ridley Scott, il duello a cavallo, Harvey Keitel per un attimo trasfigurato dal tramonto nell\u2019esiliato di S.

While I certainly enjoyed the moral explorations and stylistic form of the work, I didn't feel the call I feel after reading some authors that leads me to seek out their other works. 'Heart of Darkness' had plunged fully into its themes, it touched the murky bottom of the human soul, and returned with a handful of black silt for the reader to bear with them through life. Not only was the book complete, but it was a rather emotionally overwhelming experience, providing a lifetime of retrospect. What is gained by taking the plunge again, under a new title?Little enough, I thought. Other than his magnum opus, Conrad is rarely shown the light of day, having been grouped with other 'colonial' writers like Haggard and Kipling. Yet after watching Ridley Scott's film adaptation of this story, my imagination was piqued. It is extremely true to the original story, and though there are some grim glimpses of war, it is by and large a humorous (if somewhat sardonic) story of the Napoleonic wars.His historical romp feels much like a simplified 'Three Musketeers', and shows off Conrad's excellent pacing and sense of place. Like Melville, he also gives us a rather unique and precise historical view, replete with details and mood. It still retains much of the realism and grit of 'Heart of Darkness', but while that presents a failed adventure that soon spirals out of control, 'The Duel' takes a more romantic tack.It's surprising to see such a delicate and varied hand from Conrad, especially as he rarely gets credit for it in literary discussion. 'Heart of Darkness' is such a powerful and contentious book that it seems to have taken over Conrad's reputation. He is so often the touchpoint of post-colonial, post-feminist, multicultural debates that he becomes merely a symbol. It is unfortunate that he is not looked on more often as simply a writer, and not a bad one, at that."}, {"userName": "Ana R\u00eenceanu", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28781546-ana-r-nceanu", "userReview": "Lieutenant Feraud nearly kills a civilian in a duel so Lieutenant D'Hubert is sent to confine him to house arrest.

Conrad sets his story in France during the Napoleonic Wars. His protagonists are Lieutenant D\u2019Hubert and Lieutenant Fernaud, officers serving in different regiments. The narrative is told primarily through the eyes of D\u2019Hubert, the more refined and thoughtful of the two, Fernaud being a fiery tempered Gascon, quick to take offence and tenacious in his hatreds. The story begins on the day when Fernaud has wounded a civilian in a duel, after which he goes to play court to a society belle at her soir\u00e9e. Dueling having been outlawed by the General, D\u2019Hubert is sent to place Fernaud under arrest. The latter takes offence at D\u2019Hubert\u2019s interruption and immediately challenges him to a duel in which Fernaud is wounded. For this D\u2019Hubert is disciplined by the authorities.As years pass, Fernaud is unwilling to let the affair languish, and the duel is repeated many times, sometimes to the advantage of one protagonist, sometimes to the advantage of the other, the relationship between the two officers becoming a mysterious legend within the army. D\u2019Hubert always tries to avoid this perpetuation of antagonisms, but his own sense of honor cannot allow him to avoid Fernaud\u2019s period challenges. Only during Napoleon\u2019s retreat from Moscow are the two able to work cooperatively and collaboratively, albeit frostily (pun intended). Each is gradually advanced through the ranks to General, and only during times of transient inequality of rank are they prohibited from dueling. D\u2019Hubert makes repeated attempts to convince Fernaud to drop the whole issue, to no avail, and the novella\u2019s ending clarifies the surprising ultimate state of the affair.The story raises several issues and questions. What it does not do is shed light on Napoleon\u2019s campaigns, nor does it intend to. It does, however, provide a window into a particular culture and ethos, highlighting the issue of \u201chonor\u201d and its constraints, something our culture talks little about. On a deeper level, it provides thoughtful insights into personality types and how irrationality motivates actions and attitudes, often trumping rationality. As would be expected of Conrad\u2019s writing, the narrative is clearly and skillfully written and presented, drawing the reader into the minds of the characters and illuminating dark places in the psyche."}, {"userName": "Almudena Romero s\u00e1nchez", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31663701-almudena-romero-s-nchez", "userReview": "I loved this book a lot. My only regret is having seen a film based on it before reading it since this always alters the way I perceive stories apart from the fact that the expectations are already disclosed. However, as I say, the story is very dramatic and it takes your breath till the end. It is again settled in a world where the lives of the characters can be transfered to the rest of the individuals. The style, the narrative, the setting, the way you are taken through the events, everything seems perfectly designed. What I admire about Joseph Conrad is the strength he gives to the stories and characters, the element of transcentalism, how every feeling is transmitted even to the point of taking your breath away withing a world beautifully described, where nature and beings melt away. To crown it all, once you have read it, watch the film \"The duellists\" starred by Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel.

Read it in one sitting. The Duel is a satiric tale about a hot-headed Hussar who refuses to forgive another officer for a non-existent insult to his honor. The two duel again and again over a fourteen year span. The duels give the men an air of mystery to their fellow officers because neither of them can or will admit to the cause of their ongoing feud. The story takes a comedic turn when the final duel ends up aiding a romance.

This was one of those books that challenged me. I had no idea what the books was about but it was freebe for my Kindle. After reading a brief synopsis of the book I found myself having to find some information on the main theme and a little history of the time the book was written. The author Joseph Conrad, writes a tale of two officers in the French Army who fought a series of of duels in the midst of Napoleonic wars on some futile pretext. This pretext was never disclosed and I think Conrad invented one. The book starts in 1800 and last until 1815. There is a lull in the Napoleonic wars and the French soldiers are enjoying a moment of peace. Napoleon Bonaparte prohibits combat with civilians by his soliders. One of his commanders, Lieutenant Feraud seriously wounds a nephew of a Mayor of a French town. A general has sent one of his officers Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert to make inquiries about this charge. He is ordered to find him and bring him back to the barracks where he will be put under house arrest. From then on for the next 15 years, Feraud will be obsessed with the idea of settling his dispute with d'Hubert by dueling with him. Conrad is a good story teller. The reader might need to do a little homework on the art of dueling which was very popular in France during this time to settle a dispute. I enjoyed the book and I also found out a little about French History during the Napoleon era."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5273746-mark", "userReview": "A while back, I was castigated by a friend for my low opinion of Steinbeck's \"Of Mice and Men\". He thought the work represented the perfect novella, but now that I have read this work, I have the candidate for that honor. Conrad's The Duel is pure pleasure. Although hard to take in larger doses, Conrad's dense, rich prose never gets in the way of this rapid-paced novella. In Napoleonic France, two officers engage in a series of duels over a period of years, and Conrad cleverly steers the reader to a very surprising conclusion. The highly detailed and descriptive prose easily supports the story as it slowly builds from episode to episode. The characters are swiftly but fully developed, and not a word is wasted. I would not ordinarily describe of work of Conrad as \"fun and gripping\", but there you go--this story is a winner. Kudos also to the publisher, Melville House, for their marvelous enhanced ebook edition, crammed with a wide range of supplementary materials, called \"Illuminations\". Selections from Napoleon's writings, a dueling manual, critical essays, art, and other writings shed light on the writer, the work, and the times. This is exactly the kind of value-add that will make ebooks attractive and successful--hats off to Melville House for their intelligent and forward-looking approach."}, {"userName": "Ricardo Santos", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27623517-ricardo-santos", "userReview": "Conrad eleva a fic\u00e7\u00e3o de aventura, assim como le Carr\u00e9 faz com o suspense, Chandler com o policial e Gene Wolfe com a fantasia.

Specifically, I kept thinking about the part of The Ten Duel Commandments that goes like this:[BURR]Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?[HAMILTON]SureBut your man has to answer for his words, Burr[BURR]With his life? We both know that\u2019s absurd, sir[HAMILTON]Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?[BURR]Okay, so we\u2019re doin\u2019 thisSo, right: at the start of this book, D'Hubert and Feraud are both young lieutenants in Napoleon's army, stationed in Strasbourg, and Feraud has just had a duel with a civilian. D'Hubert seeks Feraud out to deliver a message from the general: the general is not pleased with Feraud's dueling, and wants him to go to his quarters and stay there. Feraud is incensed. \"I can't call the general to account for his behaviour, but you are going to answer to me for yours,\" he tells D'Hubert, who asks what he means exactly (14). To which Feraud's answer is this: \"\"I mean,\" screamed suddenly Liet. Feraud, \"to cut off your ears to teach you to disturb me with the general's orders when I am talking to a lady!\" (ibid.). D'Hubert thinks this is nuts, but he can't just not fight Feraud at this point. But the fight, once started, won't end: Feraud is wounded but sends a message to D'Hubert saying it's not over, and they proceed to have rematch duels over a period of years, as they both rise through the ranks of the army. Their duel (which Conrad apparently based on a true story) becomes the stuff of legend: no one knows what started it, they won't talk about what started it, and so everyone assumes it must be some huge/deep thing. D'Hubert, meanwhile, is caught up in the momentum of it: even as he despairs over \"the imbecility of the impending fight\" at one point, he can't just stop (51). Or even if he stops, it's just temporary: at one point, a superior imposes a 12-month truce on the pair, and they also don't fight each other when they're retreating from Moscow together, since they're too busy nearly dying of cold and starvation and also too busy fighting off Russians (the retreat from Moscow is probably my favorite part of the book, or maybe is tied with the pair's final duel as being my favorite part).There are five different books called The Duel in Melville House's Art of the Novella series, and this is the third I've read and maybe my favorite so far, but that may not be saying much: I may just not be a fan of books about duels? (I'd call this 2.5 stars but I'm rounding up because I like books that make me think of Hamilton.) We'll see how I feel if I eventually read the other two in this set."}, {"userName": "Aaron Mcquiston", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5955599-aaron-mcquiston", "userReview": "I had only read \"Heart of Darkness\" by Conrad before picking up this novella. I had to read \"Heart of Darkness\" for school and I think that I might have liked it, but I'm not really sure. Since this is only the second thing of Conrad's that I read (and the first being a foggy memory from years ago), it felt like I was discovering a new author, one that I should be ashamed for not having read more of his works. \"The Duel\" is the story of two French career military men who have a duel whenever they are in close proximity. Based on a true story, the most interesting aspect of the ongoing feud is that there is a silence amoungst the two men regarding what the feud is over. In fact, the original duel is over a matter so slight that it is mostly likely forgotten by the two men, so toward the end, they could not tell anyone what started to battle.Here is where I am reading this novella in the middle of the night, in one sitting, and thinking, \"How hard would it be to have an enemy that without my forewarning came to me and said, 'Tomorrow I will try to kill you'?\" It seems like undue stress and an unfair way to live your life. Having said that, it slowly comes to light that these two men are not as much stressed over the situation as they need the situation to live. They form a bond by trying to kill each other, and this bond keeps them young and active. This is an unique idea to ponder, one of the early ideas on frenemies. I'm sure this was not what Conrad had in mind when writing this story, but this aspect still makes \"The Duel\" very relevant in a society that no longer hosts formal duels. On a side note, this editoin of the \"Duel\" published by Melville House, has a ton of extra goodies in the back, including excerpts from Napoleon's memoirs, nonficiton accounts of duels during the French Revolution, and of course, the rules to duels in various countries (France having the most rules at 95). The supplemental information is definately worth reading and makes the art and history of the duel come to life."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7420470-david", "userReview": "Published in 1908 in England as \"The Duel,\" it is not the best of Conrad's stories. Yet it is well written, develops logically through the four sections of the tale, and depicts military life of officers during Napoleon's army times - and does this vividly. The plot develops over some 15 years in a smooth easy pace, making for a small bit of French live military history. In the edition I read, the few color illustrations add creatively to Conrad's short story.The two men over nothing of consequence had a \"clash of arms, unique in the magnitude of its glory and disaster,\" three times over a period of perhaps two or three years. The animosity persisted, Feraud being the more combative and relentless, D'Hubert the more conciliative and philosophic. At each promotion they fought a duel. Yet this story is less about dueling than about human emotions, standards, memory, nuanced feelings, and much of interpersonal relations. The 3rd section begins: \"The retreat from Moscow submerged all private feelings in a sea of disaster and misery. Cavalry Colonels without regiments, D'Hubert and Feraud carried the musket in the ranks of the sacred battalion\u2014a battalion recruited from officers of all arms who had no longer any troops to lead. In that battalion promoted colonels did duty as sergeants.\" And weeks later, \"Later on, in Paris, while feverishly busy reorganising his regiment, Colonel Feraud learned that [his perennial foe] Colonel D'Hubert had been made a general.\" Conrad gradually and persistently builds the heat under the two. Before long, General D'Hubert is wounded and Feraud is promoted to General and takes over the foe's command. The ugliness continues! The two retired generals were the \"living wreckage of Napoleonic tempest.\" The tale is played out with D'Hubert realizing that the duel brought about his wife's run of two miles out of deep concern about the man she was marrying the net week. A nicely wrapped up twist of the two protagonists."}, {"userName": "Giuseppe", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6106695-giuseppe", "userReview": "Romanzo breve di Conrad sulla storia di due ufficiali, opposti nei caratteri e nella visione della vita, che si sfidano a duello per sedici anni durante le guerre napoleoniche e oltre.Il romanzo \u00e8 assolutamente godibile. Se l'introspezione psicologica \u00e8 quasi abbozzata (i personaggi sono dei cosiddetti \"flat character\"), la potenza dell'affresco storico invece \u00e8 affatto trascurabile. Conrad disse che con quest'opera si proponeva di cogliere lo \"spirito dei tempi\" e non si pu\u00f2 certo dire che non ci sia riuscito.Ispirato vagamente ad una storia vera, le vicende dei due ufficiali infatti sono un pretesto per raccontare l'epopea napoleonica e la storia della Francia di quegli anni. D'Hubert e Feraud testimoniano lo splendore e la disfatta causata alla Francia dall'ambizione dell'imperatore francese. E' lui, il personaggio che non incontriamo mai di persona, ma che aleggia nel racconto con la sua presenza, il trait d'union tra i due protagonisti. Seppur di carattere opposto, essi sembrano essere due facce della stessa medaglia: cos\u00ec diversi ma cos\u00ec uguali nel loro essere soldati pronti a servire la \"causa\". C'\u00e8 quasi un'eco romantica in questi due personaggi a cui fanno da contralto i pi\u00f9 pragmatici comprimari: dalla sorella realista di D'Hubert al mellifluo ministro di Polizia Fouch\u00e9, passando per lo Chevalier futuro suocero di D'Hubert. Che sembrano essere esclusi e non comprendere il \"sogno\" napoleonico, cos\u00ec come non riusciranno a capire le motivazioni (assurde) che spingono i due a perpetrare il loro duello negli anni.E non \u00e8 un caso che il vincitore del duello (ma non vi dico chi) sar\u00e0 proprio colui che riuscir\u00e0 a superare, rinnegando in parte se stesso, tale eco.P.s: il libro mi ha lasciato desideroso di vedere il film \"The duellists\" del 1977, opera prima del regista Ridley Scott."}, {"userName": "Pumpernickel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2551356-pumpernickel", "userReview": "The story is good, but I have a VERY sad story connected with that book, one that I will never forget, UNFORTUNATELY : totally contrary to my habits and principles, I LENT this book to my speech therapist ( I was very ill, that's why I needed her , in Portuguese : fonoaudi\u00f3loga ) .
