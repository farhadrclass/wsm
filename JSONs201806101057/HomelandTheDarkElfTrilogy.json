Please let me know if I missed somebody. For those unfamiliar with Forgotten Realms and the whole Dungeons and Dragons thingy I have just one question: what rock have you been living under? Anyway welcome to Menzoberranzan (I will award my very special bonus points to anybody who was able to pronounce the city's name correctly on the first try). The underground city is the home of dark elves who call themselves drow. They are not nice by any stretch of imagination and make Darth Vader look like a kindergarten bully wannabe. To put it simply, drows who are less evil than Sauron, Shai'tan, and Wicked Witch of the East rolled in one simply do not survive for long. An unusual child is born in one of the families; I am using word \"family\" in very loose sense here. He was supposed to be sacrificed to the local deity The Spider Queen, but was saved from this by some very fortunate - or unfortunate depending on point of view - timing. His name is Drizzt and he will grow up to become a legend:This book is about his youth and constant struggles for survival. This was actually the main point of attraction of the novel for me. I was very curious to see what happened to Drizzt to make him grow up a normal human (sorry elf) being. He did not become Mary Sue - not yet at least, but compared to the rest of the drows he is Mary Sue. The (under)world is great. I am not sure how much of it came from the author and how much from already existing standard Forgotten Realms settings, so I will not attribute all of it to Salvatore's creative writing. Let me just say that if you are looking for a completely bleak and hopeless world, look no further. Other than the world itself I found the intrigues and constant backstabbing of the drow society fascinating. Usually in any literature the best written characters are the ones written in different shades of gray (sorry no pun intended). In this book the vast majority of the characters are written in different shades of black with an exception of Drizzt and possibly his mentor Zak. I would not call them very well developed - again with the exception of Drizzt himself, but there were some interesting two-dimensional ones who actually serve their purpose in the story nicely. I began reading this story not expecting to find an example of high literature but hoping to be entertained. This is exactly what I got in the end. I look forward to read the next book as this one while not ending in a cliffhanger still leaves things in fairly unsettled state and I am curious to see the further development. My rating is 3.5 stars rounded down."}, {"userName": "Forrest", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/811928-forrest", "userReview": "Oh, Mr. Salvatore. Methinks thou hast bitten off more than thou canst chew.Intentionally or not, R.A. Salvatore has created a potential monster here. Not in the Underdark denizens or in the drow society that provides the backdrop for the story. Not even in Lloth, queen of the demonweb pits and diety to the drow. I'm talking about the themes of race, gender, and, most of all, the nature versus nurture debate. If I were a smarter man with more time, I'd delve into each of these, but suffice it to say that, for all its hacking, slaying, nobility, and heroics, Homeland is a sociologists dream-come-true. I would not be surprised if this book was picked apart in some obscure Master's thesis and the story's themes vetted against the author's background and the general social, racial, and economic background of the book's target audience. Salvatore has really opened a can of worms here.That said, let's take a quick look at the book itself, regardless of its (probably unintentional) implications.I love the setting. At times I felt a bit of tunnel vision while reading, like the room around me was getting darker and the only thing illuminating my eyes were the words on the page. Salvatore does an outstanding job of painting a picture. As far as plot goes - it's interesting, but not earth-shattering. The many intrigues of the book seem a little obvious, on the face of it. Once one understands the Drow modus operandi, nothing seems too surprising.What is surprising is the characterization. And this, I think, is where Salvatore is going to or has already gotten himself into trouble with modern readers. Or maybe not. The action focuses, of course, on Drizzt, the young dark elf born at the height of a battle in which his \"house\" is in the process of destroying another \"house\". Honestly, I found Drizzt to be unconvincing. He's pretty whiny, to be frank, and the altruism within him that Salvatore makes too obvious is not terribly believable, given the circumstances of his up-bringing - essentially being brainwashed and beat into submission at a young age to learn his place in Drow society. Problem is, who are Drizzt's role models for his resistance to the cultural programming he undergoes? Color me jaded, but the survival instinct often causes humans to bend to societal pressures to one degree or another. \"But Drow are different!\" you say. Really? Then why is Drizzt the only Drow to fully keep his own culture at bay? You might argue that Drizzt's weaponmaster, Zaknafein, successfully maneuvers his way around Drow culture while keeping his own moral code intact, but this is easily refuted by examining Zak and Drizzt's familial relationship itself (don't want to spoil, just keep in mind that their relationship is critical to the story). Besides, Zak, in the end, proves submissive to the matriarchal power of the Drow social structure.The character I find most believable is Vierna, one of Drizzt's sisters. Again, I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it pays to read Vierna carefully, to see where and why she has resisted Drow society in some ways and succumbed in others. I find her the most compelling character of the book, though she is only a minor player in the grand scheme (and there is a grand scheme in this book - several, actually). I'd love to see a book or two focused solely on Vierna. There's fantasy gold there!Now, all that said, I really did enjoy the book. The nurture vs nature theme could and should have been handled with much more subtlety, but I was able to shrug off my annoyance and move on. Homeland sets the stage for something bigger, I am hoping. I will be reading the other two books in the Dark Elf Trilogy in the future. I can see the potential in Drizzt as a character and I'm thinking that we haven't seen the last of his clan or of a certain deep gnome. I look forward to seeing how Salvatore handles Drizzt's emotions as an outcast from among his own people and am especially excited to see where Drizzt's wanderings take him. The world building here is excellent, with a well-fleshed-out culture that could provide great cognizant dissonance in the main character as he strikes out to escape and explore the Underdark and maybe even the surface(???). So, I give it a 3.5, rounded up to a four. It has it's zits and scars, but with the right makeup this book could have been beautiful. I'm hoping it ages well in the next two volumes and leaves behind childish things as Drizzt leaves behind his childhood and his childhood home. It's time to grow up. I hope that Salvatore was a good parent. Oh, and if you do a Master's thesis on the sociological implications of the text, as I've outlined above, my consultant fees are reasonable . . . I take pay in blue cheese, expensive dark chocolate, good ginger ale, honest reviews of my own work and, of course, books."}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/290975-justin", "userReview": "Homeland was the first fantasy book I ever read, and I only read it because it was a Christmas gift and I was bored. But that first copy of this book has now been read so many times, by me and everyone I ever thrust it on to read, that the spine is barely holding together and the cover is threatening to disintegrate. For a dork who really likes fantasy novels, this story was just too engrossing for me to ever stop reading. While I can't say it's a great cultural work or the kind of story everyone should read; it's my literary equivalent of comfort food.

I own most of the books and kept buying them every time I ran across one or another in used book shops or Amazon sales, so I am very prepared to read all of them, as long as there is time and it is in G-d's plans... This is the beginning of the Legend of Drizzt, but I think it is sixth or seventh in the order of Forgotten Realms. Hopefully by the time I am done I will be able to have read every one of the books in this vast Universe. Since the books came after the Role Playing Game, I did not expect too much in the way of \"literature\" in this book, but I actually was pleasantly surprised. No, not that this is in any way high prose and immense literally value, but it was well enough written to allow us to grasp the nature of the world, begin caring about what happens with Drizzt and convey some intense action sequences on several occasions, so yeah, it was very entertaining. \n\"... \u201cThey live with the belief that anything is acceptable if you can get away with it, that self-gratification is the most important aspect of existence, and that power comes only to she or he who is strong enough and cunning enough to snatch it from the failing hands of those who no longer deserve it. Compassion has no place in Menzoberranzan, and yet it is compassion, not fear, that brings harmony to most races. It is harmony, working toward shared goals, that precedes greatness.\u201d ...\"\nIn the Underdark, \"the secret world beneath the bustling surface of the Forgotten Realms\", morals are everything that we see as immoral, and smart means cunning, while dog-eats-dog is the way of everyday life. In one of the Underdark caverns is the settlement of Menzoberranzan, where Dark Elves calling themselves Drow, have lived for generations. In their lore, the surface walking Light Elves had committed atrocities against the Drow and run them under the ground, where they have lived and worshiped the Spider Queen, their deity of chaos Lolth. Their society is matriarchal and family ties only matter as long as one can bring something of value to the family, which is closer to the meaning of the way the Mafia interprets it. \n\"... \u201cAscension to power in drow society is a simple process of assassination. The Spider Queen is a deity of chaos, and she and her high priestesses, the true rulers of the drow world, do not look with ill favor upon ambitious individuals wielding poisoned daggers.\u201d ...\"\nIn this dark and vicious world is born our hero, a drow named Drizzt Do'Urden, the third son of a matriarch who was very willing to sacrifice him to the goddess for taking down successfully a rival house and advancing in the overall hierarchy. From the first there is something odd about him, being born with violet eyes and thought blind by his relatives, which would have been a good enough reason to kill him right then and there. However, his first brother gets conveniently killed and this spares his life, putting him in the care of one of his sisters for the first 10 years. The boy shows smarts and eagerness, which are not necessarily good features in a male, the way this community is set up. So he gets as much or more beatings and \"discipline\" by the older sisters before being given under the tutelage of Zaknafei, the weapon master of house Do'Urden and Drizzt biological father. He turns out to be a very gifted sward master and from the age of 15 to about 30 is given into the military Academy, where he proves to be as good as his promise. But this is the place where he is finally introduced to the truth of his people and discovers that he doesn't really belong in this bloodthirsty lot. \n\"... \u201c\u201cWhat place is this,\u201d Drizzt asked the cat quietly, \u201cthat I call home? These are my people, by skin and by heritage, but I am no kin to them. They are lost and ever will be. \u201cHow many others are like me, I wonder?\u201d Drizzt whispered, taking one final look. \u201cDoomed souls, as was Zaknafein, poor Zak. I do this for him, Guenhwyvar; I leave as he could not, His life has been my lesion, a dark scroll etched by the heavy price exacted by Matron Malice\u2019s evil promises. \u201cGoodbye, Zack!\u201d he cried, his voice rising in final defiance. \u201cMy father. Take heart, as do I, that when we meet again, in a life after this, it will surely not be in the hellfire our kin are doomed to endure.\u201d ...\"\nSo, the book does tend to tell us more than show us as far as characters and emotions are concerned, but when it comes to the action, it does a really good job, kept me on the edge of my seat during every battle and duel. It is the story of the odd man out and it would have probably been much more impactful if I had read it at the time it was published, but I am glad I finally dived into this world. A fast and easy read, appropriate for all ages and good for those just coming into Fantasy. I am looking forward to the next adventure... Now I wish you all Happy Reading and may you always find what you need in the pages of a Good Book!!!"}, {"userName": "Traci", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5024825-traci", "userReview": "I read this years ago, maybe ten, and wondered how it would measure up to my memory. Not bad.Salvatore is good at delivering what he promises. These are just fun action packed fantasy reads. With interesting places, memorable characters, exotic creatures and exciting battles. Although there are moments when he takes himself too seriously. When reading Forgotten Realms I'm not looking for philosophy you know?This is my favorite trilogy of the Drizzt books (a quick aside I enjoy Salvatore's writing but some of his names are just terrible). I like how each book has a theme and represents the journey of his youth. In Homeland we read about the drow and their homeworld. The family, religion, academic, and political aspects of their race. And although in this book they come across a little one dimensional (they get better) it's an interestingly different read. One of my favorite things about the character of Drizzt (and why I'm disappointed in later books) is his inherent goodness. He's not a flawed anti hero. He doesn't struggle with doing the right thing. He doesn't do the right thing because it's \"right\" (and actually in his world it's the wrong thing) but because it's instinct. But he also isn't a saint, savior, or paragon. My favorite sections in this one are those between Drizzt and his father Zaknafein (these names are like bad scramble hands-thanks mst3k) Zak like his son is cursed with morals in an immoral society. He is stuck in a life he hates. Lashing out the only way he can. In many ways reading this today ten years, or so, older I found his plight more interesting than young Drizzt's.So yes, I still loved it. It won't stack up well against your Martin, Erikson, Abercrombie, Kay...but they aren't meant to.I recommend to any open minded fan of fantasy who wants a fun quick book."}, {"userName": "Kaora", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7983564-kaora", "userReview": "I'll admit it.I went into this expecting a book like Dragons of Autumn Twilight. An interesting world, flat characters and cheesy dialogue.I was not expecting how dark it was.The drow are the survivors, and this is the Under-dark, the valley of death - the land of nameless nightmares.In Menzoberranzan anything goes as long as you aren't caught. Into this society, Drizzt Do'Urden is born, a drow with rare violet eyes and a conscience. He must struggle to come to terms with a society that will do anything to appease a violent and bloodthirsty Spider Queen, and hopefully keep his integrity.I think the thing that I enjoyed the most was the world building. Salvatore paints a bleak picture but a lot of the settings were painted much better than was done in Dragons. I also did enjoy getting to know Zak and Drizzt two of my favorite characters.Some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy, but I think the world building more than made up for that.I am definitely a fan."}, {"userName": "Rick | Another Book Blog", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5697316-rick-another-book-blog", "userReview": "Maybe it's the deliberate hack-and-slash approach. Maybe it's that this book is intended for teenagers. Or maybe it's that George R. R. Martin's A Dance With Dragons\u00a0hits stores in two days and I can't think of anything else. But after ignoring the pleas of online fans and personal friends for years upon years, my eventual reading of Homeland was one of utter disappointment. This is as hollow a book as you're bound to find.I feel for R.A. Salvatore. I really do. I truly believe that behind the obligatory fight scenes and overabundance of magic there is a good writer somewhere in him. Between the obvious evil and hit-you-on-the-head darkness of Homeland\u00a0there are some genuinely well-written passages. But when he's in Forgotten Realms mode Salvatore knows his audience (and kudos to him for that ... he's been very successful with it), meaning he forces himself to move inside the tight constrictions of the genre \u2014 the often generic, bland, straightforward campaign setting of a role-playing game.\u00a0This is a world of very clear dichotomies, where on one side you have the good and on the other the bad. There are more shades of grey on Drizzt's armor than there are in all of Menzoberranzan. This results in a world that presents very few surprises, where victories are assured from the very beginning, and the choice between good and evil couldn't be less interesting.Homeland\u00a0was released in 1990, right at the tail edge of the Dungeons and Dragons boom. At the time these books were a revelation in genre circles, but since, they've become antiquated and anachronistic. For a certain readership \u2014 one looking for the literary equivalent of a Michael Bay movie \u2014 Salvatore will give you exactly what you're looking for. Have at it. They're just not for me. Not anymore.\u00a0I wish ... I just wish he would have went for it, you know? There are the makings of a terrific story here, of a boy who escapes the trappings of a society bent on indoctrination and lawlessness to become a beacon of hope for a world wholly different than himself. There's power\u00a0in this story, there's meaning\u00a0here. But, due to the nature of the genre, Salvatore never had a chance.\u00a0Homeland\u00a0won't challenge you, or provide you with amusement. But, ultimately it succeeds in its purpose: to entertain in a harmless, mindless fashion for a few hundred pages. But if you're tired of escapist, simplistic worlds where the only sell-points are sword-wielding and magic-dueling, move on. And if you were thinking of exploring the rest of The Forgotten Realms, well, Salvatore's the best you've got.

A. Salvatore book I read was \u201cSword of Bedwyr\u201d, and I would liken it to an action-packed summer blockbuster movie. It was filled with exciting fight scenes, and the characters got off a lot of funny one-liners, but the plot itself was pretty basic and generic. I went into \u201cHomeland\u201d expecting something similar, but as it turns out, if \u201cSword of Bedwyr\u201d was a breezy popcorn movie, then \u201cHomeland\u201d is an Academy-Award winning epic! While \u201cHomeland\u201d does feature some of Salvatore\u2019s signature detailed action sequences and humor, the focus this time is the story and character development. Salvatore creates a world and mythology for the dark elves that is incredibly deep and compelling. It truly is an amazing journey watching the young Drizzt Do\u2019Urden become more and more aware of the evils of his homeland and his refusal to be a part of it. Drizzt\u2019s moral dilemma would have been interesting enough to carry the book, but Salvatore also gives us many other captivating characters in Drizzt\u2019s family as well, from middle sister Vierna, who is not totally infected by the evil of her homeland but lacks the backbone to fight it, to mother Matron Malice and oldest sister Briza, who are all too eager to embrace the malevolence and cruelty that permeates Menzoberranzen.The only problem I had with this book was, since it was my first time reading about Drizzt (or any book from the Forgotten Realms universe), I did have a little trouble keeping up with everything at first. However, it didn\u2019t take me long at all to become completely immersed in the world of the dark elves. If anyone starts reading this book and finds it a little hard to get into at first, I would definitely recommend you stick with it, as you will be greatly rewarded.If this had been simply a good book, it would have just made me want to read more of the legend of Drizzt.

Love and honour have no place on Homeland, where hate, cruelty and violence rule, burried deep within the bowels of the earth under the strict supervision of the malevolent Spider Queen.This world where new born male babies are sacrificed by their own mothers for the favour of the Queen and where children are brought up under the constant bite of snake-headed whips is the home of the young dark elf Drizzt, the hero of this series.Here we get to see how Drizzt grows up and how this dark world shapes the little boy he was into the exceptional young warrior he will become.There are so many great things I could tell you about this book but as you may not have enough time or proper mood to go through it all, I'll just wrap it up and make it short by saying:I loved loved loved it!

Raised primarily by his sister, Vierna, and later Zak, Drizzt learns the ways of the dark elves. Something is different about Drizzt though; in many ways he is unlike his evil drow kin. While those around him give themselves over to pleasing the Spider Queen, Drizzt finds it exceedingly more difficult to function in a world that goes against his inner morals.The review:There were several things about this novel that made it unique from a lot of other fantasy novels I have read.One of the most distinctive aspects of this novel is the role that women play in the drow world. I have read about strong women in fantasy in the past, but this book takes the cake. In the drow society, the women are the total rulers; they dictate the entire society, and treat men as if they are beneath them. The women have no problem demonstrating their authority over the men through the use of their snake headed whips. P.S. The snake headed whips are about as awful as they sound. The men are basically there to support and aid the women in gaining higher and higher positions in both the drow households and the larger society. The women have no qualms about demanding respect, and beating or killing off those who hold them back. *The woman in me loves the fact that the drow female are so powerful, yet at the same time I see them for what they are: evil.*Another distinguishing aspect of this novel is the total and complete evilness of the drow society. There is absolutely no mercy; the drow (except for our beloved Dizzt of course) are wholly obsessed with power and title will do whatever it takes to get more of it. While I appreciated this book for its uniqueness, it still felt a little lacking. When I read some fantasy books I am frantically highlighting beautiful descriptions, epic battle scenes, etc. While reading this book I highlighted a grand total of about four lines.

As I have come to expect from Salvatore, it is melodramatic in the extreme. Drow society is over-the-top evil, bad in every way. Despite the fact that Drow females don\u2019t produce many offspring comparative to their extra-long lifespans, Drizzt was conceived as a sacrifice to the horrible spider goddess Lloth and he is spared this fate when one of his brothers murders the other. Lloth\u2019s supremacy as spider goddess has yielded a matriarchal society, where women are dominant and, like female spiders, are quite willing to dispense with a male once his purpose has been served. There is nothing resembling honour in Drow circles\u2014not even between family members. So Drizzt\u2019s violet eyes and moral sense set him apart from his own society.We also learn how he became involved with his side-kick, Guenhwyvar the black panther and how he became the fighting machine that we are familiar with from previous books.I can see where in a gaming situation, OTT characters such as these would be fun to play. It\u2019s often more fun to be a villain than a hero because you get to do the awful things.

Raised in the underground city of Menzoberranzan a young Drizzt learns the skills of swordsmanship while trying not to fall to the dark beliefs of the cruel and evil Spider Goddess religion which dominates all aspects of the Drow society. Drizzt was an easy character to like and root for which is good as apart from his mentor he was the only one in the story you could accuse of having any morals! The plot was fairly intriguing and engaging even if it did suffer from being a little too predictable. The mass of villains were suitably evil and I was happy that R. A. Salvatore had an acceptable reason as to why this would be the case. This book had been on my to-read list for almost two decades before I finally decided to give it a chance. In some ways it is a pity I waited so long as I'm sure I'd have loved reading this while I was in my teens. It was for the most part a fairly traditional coming of age fantasy of good vs evil. What elevated it above its competitors in that particularly genre was the quality of R.A.Salvatore's world building and the flowing quality of his storytelling. The underground setting of Menzoberranzan was unique and excellent while the politics, intrigue, and dark nature of life in Drow Society was fun and fascinating in equal measure.I went into this read with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The ending was interesting and I'll definitely read more of Drizzt's adventures. Rating: 3.5 stars.Audio Note: This was narrated by the dependable Victor Bevine who did a great job.

A well-rounded prequel, it takes you deep into the kingdom of Menzoberranzan where dark elves rule with unabashed cruelty. Among them dwells Drizzt, an anomaly with honor and compassion who yearns for a different life. A tad slow to start, the story soon launches to become one of the most epic fantasy adventures in the genre.There are a lot of positives to this series: Highly, and I mean HIGHLY memorable characters \u2013 I swear they\u2019re practically a religion at this point, some of the most stylized and intricate sword-fighting scenes you\u2019ll ever read, epic world-building, and a unique, mold-shattering storyline \u2013 I\u2019ve never read such a fantastic tribute to the dark elf culture.As good as the characterization is, I find it somewhat lacking in one regard: While there are a plethora of beautiful women, there is a distinct lack of relatable feminine characters, as most of them express male personalities and tendencies. While that works for some women (I realize we\u2019re all wonderfully different creatures), it should not be the standard for all. I believe women warriors can be both feminine and dangerous, just examine Kahlan in the Sword of Truth series, and you\u2019ll know what I mean. In any case, I don\u2019t think that distinction bothered many people, and despite my opinion on it, I still loved ALL the characters and Salvatore remains solidly in my top 10.Overall, if you want a long-term sustaining series that will take you on epic adventures, involve you in fantastic fight-scenes, and make you fall in love with some of the most brilliant fantasy characters in the genre\u2019s history, then these are the books for you! Still going strong, there are over 25 titles that continue the story, and each one is honestly as good as the last.Recommendations: Although the \u201cIcewind Dale\u201d trilogy was written first, I strongly recommend you start with \u201cHomeland\u201d in the \u201cDark Elf\u201d trilogy, as it is first chronologically. Not only will that give the story more of a solid flow, but is also a much stronger representation of Salvatore\u2019s works as the series continues, so if you like it, you\u2019ll probably like the entire saga.by Niki HawkesOther books you might like:\u201cDragons of Autumn Twilight\u201d by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman\u201cThe Cleric Quintet\u201d by R.A.

Salvatore, Homeland takes place first chronologically, and it reveals much of the history of one of the most famous characters of the Forgotten Realms, the Dark Elf Drizzt Do\u2019Urden. As the first book of The Dark Elf Trilogy, it provides back story to Drizzt who appeared pretty much fully-formed and complete in the novel The Crystal Shard. Starting with Homeland and proceeding through Exile and Sojourn, this trilogy details the life of Drizzt from birth to just before the events of The Crystal Shard.A troubled lifeDrizzt Do\u2019Urden suffers from a strange affliction: he isn\u2019t evil. While we are no strangers to morality and shades of grey here on Earth, fantasy settings with their roots in gaming have a slightly different outlook: namely that monster sheets have a blank that says \u201calignment\u201d on it. While it may be difficult to envision a race or society (or even a single town, for that matter) where everybody in it is evil, it is a necessary tool when you\u2019re building a world for a role-playing game. You can\u2019t handle goblins attacking the town by stopping to decide if maybe a few of the goblins are simply following orders and are really just nice guys. Goblins are evil, says so in the book, it\u2019s okay for my good character to kill goblins. It\u2019s a necessary sacrifice in the name of game design, and it bleeds into the fiction with pretty much no issues.This is why Drizzt is presented as such a compelling and sympathetic character. He\u2019s not evil, he doesn\u2019t want to be evil or do evil things, but he exists in a culture where everybody is evil. Families advance in the hierarchy of the city by exterminating the family above them. Sons and daughters in the family advance the same way. Drow Elven society is presented as a culture of paranoid opportunists who will do anything to get ahead. He knows that if the wrong people discovered his true thoughts, they would simply kill him out of hand, and that sure-fire knowledge provides the driving force of his character.A life of trialsThe problem with the above scenario, however, is that it is completely impossible. If we forget for a moment the absurdity surrounding the idea that a whole race of people are evil, and the equal absurdity that in that situation, someone could be born who is instinctively good (this also says a lot of things about nature vs. nurture that are awkward to consider in this context), the issue is that there is no way he would have survived to adolescence, let alone adulthood. It might be easy to pretend to believe a certain way and to talk a good game, but there would have come a moment, many moments, where he was called to act in a way in keeping with his society, and he would have balked. The sheer volume of second chances Drizzt gets growing up completely contradicts the cut-throat and pragmatic culture we\u2019re being asked to accept.Drizzt, of course, has one way to deal with the issue of his beliefs in the face of those of his culture: be better at everything than everyone. The primary characteristic of Drizzt, beyond not being evil, is his incredible fighting skill. He goes to the academy where the males are trained in warfare, almost immediately trusts someone, gets stabbed in the back (nearly literally), decides to just go it alone from then on, and dominates everybody in every competition forever. He falls victim to that same heroic gene that Legolas and Aragorn have in The Lord of the Rings; you know, the one that makes them basically invulnerable and immune to any harm? It really doesn\u2019t serve to make him a realistic character at all.His saving graceThe one thing that saves this review from actually being overall negative (this in spite of my Drizzt obsession while I was a young teen) is the action. If you\u2019re going to write a character who is basically a machine of death, the best thing you can do is keep putting him in fights and letting him loose. R.A. Salvatore is renowned for his combat writing, and for very good reason. The fights between Drizzt and his various recurring and one-time enemies are incredible. In the original trilogy, Drizzt gets himself a proper nemesis, the assassin Artemis Enterei, with whom he fights dozens of times in over a dozen novels, and each and every one of those fights is solid gold.You won\u2019t find any deep philosophy in the Drizzt Saga (unless you think \u201cit\u2019s so hard being good when everyone thinks you\u2019ll be evil\u201d is deep), though you can witness at least some superficial dialogue on prejudice and racism from the way most people treat him. What you will find is some of the best action fantasy ever written, with an eye on detail and description of maneuvers that create the fight right in your mind\u2019s eye. I\u2019m flabbergasted that none of these books have been tapped to be made into movies, especially with the popularity of Drizzt among readers who are now in their late 20s and early 30s. They are just -begging- for some fight choreographer to go to town on them.Why should you read this book?Drizzt Do\u2019Urden is one of the most famous characters in fantasy. Just as you should know at least a little about the origins of Superman, Gandalf the Grey, and Rand Al\u2019Thor, you can\u2019t really claim to have a properly broad appreciation for fantasy without knowing about Drizzt. While his action-packed stories are perhaps a little lacking in deep character development, the sheer quality of the action more than makes up for it. These books are quick, fun escapism distilled down to its essence. You\u2019ll burn through them quickly, and you\u2019ll have a ton of fun doing it."}, {"userName": "Gergana", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5312798-gergana", "userReview": "First read in 2008Reread in January, 2016 One of my first fantasy books back in the days when I didn't know what to read after finishing the last Harry Potter. Tough times. StoryWelcome to the underground city of Menzoberranzan, where drows, a race of dark elves, carve their homes in the enormous stalactites, where spiders are worshiped as servants of the one Goddess- Lloth, and where there is nothing better to do than kill and torture anyone or anything that stands in your way.Drizzt has been different ever since his birth. Apart from the uncharacteristic for his people violet eyes, he is innocent, compassionate, seeking love and affection in a world where ambition, power and wickedness are treasured above all. He'll have to find a way to not only survive whatever his enemies, friends and even family throw at him, but also to hide his true nature and preserve his sanity while seeking a place to belong to.Should you read Homeland?If you've tried Dungeons and Dragons or Forgotten Realms type of novels before and you weren't particularly fond of the excessive amount of characters, races, monsters, boring 1-dimensional villains, the straight-forward plot and so on, then not to worry - I wasn't a huge fan of those either. Surprisingly, Homeland is a far more character driven book - a drow (aka. dark elf), who doesn't fit in the cruel and depraved society of his race. Conclusion8 years ago, I was in LOVE with Drizzt's adventures! Today? I still enjoyed it, I still find the setting and world-building excellent and creative, the characters were engaging and Drizzt is a wonderful protagonist. You can feel his inner struggles trying to fit in, but at the same time refusing to go completely murderous and villainous as the rest of his race. Overall, an interesting and entertaining read, with an amazing setting, some good character exploration. Can't say it's one of my all time favorites, but I enjoyed the reread regardless.PS: I only enjoyed the first three books from the whole series: Homeland, Exile and Sojourn.

The writing style holds the reader's hand a lot: we're told the motives behind every character's action, instead of having to derive intent from their actions, the narration stops to explain how things work rather than immersing us in the world and letting us figure it out. It's also a binary world: everyone is either evil or good, even entire races are described as \"evil\" by the narrator.Overall Drizzt is the embodiment of geek wish-fulfillment: an incredibly talented swordsman, who also happens to be amazingly talented in sorcery (so much so that they had a tough time determining which school he should go to). He's the only person with a morality we would recognize in a world of people who see no problem with killing, who worship a spider god, and who only understand violence as a way of life. Oh, he also has a super cool pet panther.One example of how little sense Drizzt makes: the first time he, or any of his underground-dwelling friends, encounter life on the surface, he is somehow the only person who automatically recognizes the sights, sounds, and smells as beautiful. Also, the narrator doesn't try to show us the surface world as it would be experienced by someone who had spent his whole life underground, instead just talks about squirrels, birds, and trees as though Drizzt would know what these things are. Granted it would be hard to write that scene from Drizzt's perspective, but that challenge is the heart of fiction: showing us the world from another's point of view.I think there's a decent story in here and did manage to finish the book, but I think the morality problems in this book need to be handled with a bit more sophistication in order to feel at all real."}, {"userName": "Jay  The Crippled God", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7226939-jay-the-crippled-god", "userReview": "Enjoyed it to the max.
