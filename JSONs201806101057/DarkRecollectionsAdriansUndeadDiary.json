Completed, 4.25.2014I was looking through some books on amazon and ran across this zombie apocalypse story. I noticed it is a series and since 4 of the books have been released, I thought I'd give it a change. I absolutely fell in love with the protagonist, Adrian Ring. He was former military and I love military or former military in these many zombie books. After Adrian realizes the apocalypse has hit, he goes to several friend's homes and stops by to check on his mother. He finds different situations at each house and ends up by himself for now. Because he is able to have electricity for a few hours a day, Adrian decides to type a journal and the story starts with the first day he begins typing his journal.I learned a lot about Adrian from his journal. His fears became very real, but he remembered his training and was able to over-come much fear. Adrian's character development was well written. He used his sense of humor when writing, which most likely helped him stay sane. As he started thinking of more he could do and what he needed to do to survive, his thought process followed-up with these survival ideas. He clearly planned, organized, carried out and controlled what he was doing. He knew specific things he wanted...it was more like he went into homes or businesses looking for specific things that he already knew he needed instead of running across items and saying, \u201cOh, yea, I can use that.\u201d For example, he knew he needed a wood burning stove for warmth and cooking. I mean he did come across things he wasn't necessarily looking for, but his plans were well thought out.There were a couple of chapters in the book that were not from the protagonist point of view. These chapters were the stories of what happened to a couple of different people in this small town where Adrian lived and people he happened to come across (for one reason or another) on \u201cthat day\u201d. These were so well written. I found myself really caring about these people and wanting them to survive this terrible time. I also appreciate a map of the area in a story. This author does include a nice map of the area where Adrian was holed up.There were several typos, wrong words, misspelled words and grammar errors. For me, these mistakes did not take away from the story. I hope to see improvement in these things in the later books in the series.I would recommend this book"}, {"userName": "Joshua Christensen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25029005-joshua-christensen", "userReview": "I am so excited that this is finally going to print. For those who do not know about this story, it is time for you to check it out. The original format was entries being placed in \"Adrian's\" journal (online) every few days or sometimes a week or more apart. After my reading it for over a year and a half the story was completed. It will now be printed in its entirety in 8 full length books. The massive size of this story is unbelievable. Congratulations Chris Philbrook for the finest literary contribution I have ever been exposed to. The suspense, survival knowledge, and humor always had me looking for the next update. I remember many a late nights hoping a new entry would be posted. This series of books cover many themes, including Horror (Zombies), Survival, collapse of the thin veneer of civilization, prepping, good/evil, and great humor. It has a very unique point of view and it spreads its focus away from just alive versus undead. Some groups of people working in a cooporative and others fighting for the few remaining resources. My emotional attachment to Adrian was intense.

It will make you laugh, it will make you cry (if you are a wuss because I totally didn't) it will piss you off in places. I started reading it again just because I missed the characters so much. I generally don't read a lot so it takes an interesting story to suck me in much less 8 books worth! The fact that this was the equivalent to War and Peace in length amazed me because it had my attention the whole time and it did not feel that long, I didn't want it to end!

How this one slipped by me is baffling, as it fits perfectly with my preferences and meets all my needs in a piece of work. Chris Philbrook, the very talented author of the series, originally submitted Dark recollections for review. When it came up in my queue, I read it in one sitting. The book was so entertaining, I managed to get through all 266 pages in under three hours; there was no way I was putting it down. As soon as I got back from vacation, and within internet range, I contacted the author to submit more of the series. My whistle was suitably wetted, and I wanted more!Adrian Ring, dorm supervisor for a private school, finds himself jarred awake by the sound of gunshots. A woman lay in the road, her head a mass of pulp from the impact of a bullet. It is only then that he realized what he had shrugged off as a hoax was indeed the zombie apocalypse. Adrian wooed me with his self deprecating humor as he wrote entries into \"Mr. Journal\". I found myself laughing as he went old-school and pulled out \"nincompoop\", and took out his frustration on his journal, frequently telling it to F-off.Armed with a box of food, a couple new weapons from the local gun shop, and his fat cat Otis, Adrian hunkers down and barricades himself behind the walls of the school as things go from bad to worse in his community.Dark Recollections does not divulge the cause of the zombie outbreak, only that if you die, you turn. Philbrook's zombies are of the slow, shambling, Romero variety. As a lover of the gore, I appreciated his use of description and could easily envision the undead as they came to life on the pages (pun intended).One of the things I found most successful about the book was Philbrook's ability to take a normally narrow writing perspective and still give readers a feel for what was happening beyond just a single person. I didn't feel as if I were reading a narrow scope of the events as told by Adrian.So, what's the verdict? Great story line with laugh out loud humor and bloody deaths, three dimensional character development, and an exciting, fast-paced piece of work that gives even the most notable zompoc authors a run for their money.Visit www.bookie-monster.com to read my full review."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8112069-brian", "userReview": "I\u2019m not one to write reviews. But I feel I must for AUD!If you like reading comedy, drama, fiction, suspense it is ALL in here!When this first popped up in my browser I thought to myself. \u201cHmm, this sounds kind of neat. A post apocalyptic diary of a man and his adventures with zombies.\u201d I then found myself going to the website and checking out the first few posts. As soon as I finished reading I became a member of the site. Vastly sucked into Adrian\u2019s world. I would wait, very impatiently, for the next post. Then I would see a message from Chris on my FB news feed with something along the lines of; \u201cAdrian has something to say\u201d or \u201cAdrian is about to write in his diary\u201d. And joyous warmth would consume me. As a reader I tend to read a few chapters of a book. Then put it down for a week or two, come back and read some more. I generally don\u2019t read cover to cover. But with AUD I read every diary entry as soon as it was posted. Then re-read so I could get my fix waiting on the next post.The story is written beautifully. I didn\u2019t see anything coming as I was reading. I was surprised with every word. I became part of Adrian\u2019s world. As the reader you feel as if you ARE his computer that he is talking to.

I WANTED him to succeed.One technique that really helped is that there are two chapters, actually short stories, of people that Adrian has mentioned crossing paths with in his Journal. These short stories give us an outside perspective of Adrian. I found it very effective in making me like Adrian, and it helped to explain why some other situations played out the way they did.

I don't identify with any one genre, just well written stories. In the past couple of years though I've started reading more and more stories that are placed online. Not because its cheap reading but because there is a community of authors that is not only maturing in quality, but in some I've long felt that many of the finest authors out there today are the ones who have seen their humble beginnings start on the internet. They spend hours putting out their works not for the money but for the pure love of writing their story in a way that will get it read, their satisfaction coming from the enjoyment it gives their readers.Chris Philbrook in my opinion is one of the best of this new group. I just happened to discover \"Adrian's Undead Diary\" one night in passing on a forum and decided to give it a look. By the time I was done with the first post I was drawn in to the apocalyptic world he had created and to his protagonist Adrian. Many\u2026 MANY late nights were spent reading \"just one more post\" before heading to bed followed by to many tired mornings. It took several months to get through it all, indeed Chris has written a lot - but it didn't feel that way. The hallmark of a good story is its ability to suck you in and this did just that. When I found out Chris was going to take the next step and self publish I couldn't be happier for him. Not just as a person - Chris is an excellent guy - but as an author whose time has very deservedly arrived. He's spent a lot of time not just writing but listening to his fans and refining what he does, the result being the story that hopefully you will start reading yourself.Do yourself a favor. If you are a fan of a well crafted story, buy this as soon as its available. Even if you are not a fan of zombie lit you will get pulled into a story that is gripping, and behind a hero that manages to be tough as nails while never giving you that sense that he's unbeatable.

The only time I tend to sit down and write a review is when it's about something that I really love. Let me just say that Adrian's Undead Diary (AUD) has been one of the most exciting and captivating stories that I may have ever read.I'm an avid reader of books, but the ones that I hold near and dear to my heart are the ones where I feel like I could actually be friends with the characters. You know those books. The ones you sit down to read and all of a sudden you're thinking about stories from your own life and people you really know and how much these characters remind you of that/them. That's what AUD is. It is undeniably relatable, and pulls you in and captures your attention from the first entry. These books are more than just a zombie story. There's suspense, and violence, and romance, and crude humor (which let's be honest, I love) and just...so much emotion. I have to be honest that there were a few parts that made me tear up. That's good writing right there. Please don't feel like eight books is too much to get invested in. You will finish the first one and crave more immediately. You will not want the story to end, and when it does, you will go back and start to read it from the beginning again. I know that's what I and many other people have done. All said and done, please give this book a chance if you are on the fence. Do yourself the favor and read this. Not only is the author an amazing writer, but he's also a pretty cool dude. I will continue to show my support by writing reviews of his books, and putting my money where my mouth is and supporting this cause to get all of AUD published.

I promise that you will be captivated. Because Chris Philbrook hasn't just crafted us a story to read, he's presented us with a journey (and an epic one at that). Alongside a cast of inherently flawed, inherently human, and completely relatable characters. I don't even think one needs to be a fan of zombie fiction to end up a fan of AUD; because Chris's talent can't be pigeonholed into one limited, literary genre. His true talent lies in weaving an enduring, sweeping story that does exactly what it's supposed to do... pulls you in, engrosses you, evokes emotion, and leaves you satisfied (if not a little bit sad) when it's over. In the case of AUD, for me, the zombies are just a bonus! I can't remember a time when I didn't have my nose in a book; yet my list of favorites is a remarkably short one. From the first few passages I read of AUD, I knew it would make that list; whether it ever had the benefit of pages or binding.

I've cried for Adrian more than once. If you like good stories and also like zombies, this story is for you.
