I can't wait to collect them all. I wish all of the books I read, especially YA fantasy, would come out with illustrated editions. What a nostalgic concept. I love it. These look so lovely sitting on my shelves I can hardly stand it. This box set was only $30.00 (for both books incl. slipcover) on Abe Books.

They loved the gorgeous illustrations & we read them as a bedtime story, which made these perfect. (I hope they make illustrated books of the entire series.) We ended up continuing the story by listening to the audiobooks, narrated by Jim Dale (who is an AMAZING narrator by the way), and the kids are now almost done with the entire series... Highly recommend these for your kid's library!"}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66241746-ed", "userReview": "This review is for the Illustrated editions of books 1 and 2. I read these Potters years ago and in all honesty didn't love either of the first couple of books in the series (or indeed the end couple, but that's a different review). They were okay stories, by the numbers and predictable adventures with some nice twists on the school novel. This time, however, I was reading them aloud to my son and in that context and with the wonderful illustrations they were absolutely brilliant.My boy loved these books, was completely absorbed in the stories and enjoyed the meandering details which I might have found slow or tedious otherwise. The characters border on caricature but when you're reading aloud and giving each character their own 'voice' this actually makes the experience more entertaining for both reader and listener. The lack of demands in terms of complexity become a point in these stories favour when you're reading to a five or six year old; complex enough to demand concentration and reward engagement, but not so intricate that they lose interest. The entire experience is added to immeasurably by Jim Kay's illustrations, which bring to life Rowling's world beautifully. Each time we got to one of the full page illustrations my son would pore over it, asking questions and relating it back to what we had just been reading.Overall a terrific shared reading experience which leaves both of us looking forward to the delivery of the 3rd illustrated edition this Christmas!"}, {"userName": "Izzy Rizzo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68948233-izzy-rizzo", "userReview": "read the philosophers stone , the illustrated version.
