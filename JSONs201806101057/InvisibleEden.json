I couldn't finish it - that's saying a lot for me. In the past I've put down books because of content, but I've never NOT finished a book because it failed to interest me. It was extremely difficult for me to just stop reading this book, as an avid reader it made me feel like a little bit of a failure, to not conquer that book...but I just couldn't get through it. It was pretentious, the author was name dropping every other sentence. It was also very repetative, she'd say something and then a paragraph, page, or chapter later she'd say the same thing almost word for word. I'd be reading and think, \"did I already read this page? Was I just not paying attention?\" but flip back a little and see that I had just read the same thing twice. I just couldn't push through, I couldn't do it."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9434335-mark", "userReview": "A book on a crime before it is solved is a challenge. Since there is no resolution, the author, Maria Flook fills the pages with a social history of an ambitious yet damaged young woman (murder victim Christa Worthington) who embodies the young urban professional: educated, insecure, materialistic, indulgent with herself and her child. But this slice of life delivers undeniably juicy anecdotes about the fashion industry, school days at Vassar, challenges of writing for high-powered magazines and life in New York, Paris and Truro (Cape Cod). This will not be enough for everyone. Flook has a bad habit of calling people \"nobodies,\" fatties,\" and \"losers\" as if we all want in on her nasty dorm room appraisals. The murder victim, Christa Worthington never had a chance to out grow this viewpoint. Fortunately, there is still time for the author."}, {"userName": "Koren ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17535433-koren", "userReview": "I started this book thinking it was a true crime book but its not really. It is more of a biography of the victim. If you are reading it as a biography it is ok. There are very few details of the actual crime. There is a lot of description of the town and surrounding areas, which if you are from the area you might like reading about that. At times the author seems to go off in a direction that doesn't seem to have anything to do with the story or the victim. At 400 pages I thought it might be a better story if it was at least 100 pages shorter. It seems to belabor every point. About half way through there didn't seem to be a lot that was different and I wanted it to move along a little faster."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1062623-michelle", "userReview": "The author's note warns you in the beginning that this book will not tell you who did the murder coz the crime was still unsolved at the time of publication. I appreciated the warning coz I'd've been MAD if I didn't find that out 'til the end! Knowing there'd be no answer, I was able to enjoy the tale behind the headline I remember of the murdered lady found with her two year old clinging to her bloody body, trying to nurse and to feed Mommy juice from her sippy cup (\"Mommy got into my paints.\") Interesting to read about how she ended up there. AND the internet told me that the crime was solved eventually. I looked up who did it after I finished the book.

To be fair, it may have also suffered from unrealistic expectations on my part. I was expecting a more straight-up true crime style narrative, which this most decidedly was not - it was more of a profile of the victim and meditation on class/social history on the Cape. I should probably place a little blame on the Somerville Public librarian for putting it in a display on true crime books, as well as my having just finished the Killing On The Cape podcast. Anyway, tt was well-written and I found the author's interactions with the police chief (?)/sheriff (?) [can't quite remember his title now] amusing, if at times a bit condescending on her part.

I have been vacationing in Truro for decades so I am very familiar with the town. So familiar, that I immediately knew the street the murder happened on when the story broke on the news. The book pulled me right in and I felt that I was beside the author as she wrote of the murder of Christa Worthington. I may not be as objective as I should be because I was able to put myself in every location, it was hard not to. There was only one scene in the book that distracted me because the author would have no way of knowing what was taking place at a specific moment since Christa was alone.

But at times is was disjointed and not sympathetic to the victim. Not my favorite real life crime book, it was meandering in the telling of the events."}], "description": "A literary investigation by \"one of the most powerful American writers at work today\" [Annie Proulx] of a story that riveted the nation: how an accomplished, world-traveled fashion writer who had retreated to a simpler life as a single mother on Cape Cod became the victim of a brutal, still-unsolved murder.On the surface, Christa Worthington\u2019s life had the appearance of privilege and comfort. She was the granddaughter of prominent New Yorkers. Her sparkling journalism earned the fashion world\u2019s respect. But she had turned her back on a glamorous career and begun living in the remote Cape Cod town where she had summered as a child. When she was found murdered in Truro, Massachusetts, just after New Year\u2019s Day in 2002, her toddler daughter clinging to her side, her violent death brought to the surface the many unspoken mysteries of her life. Invisible Eden is the deeply felt story of a career woman's attempt to start over and reinvent her life away from the fashion circles of New York and Paris only to have an out-of-wedlock child with a local fisherman, forge a life as a single mother, and meet a violent end. Brilliantly portraying Christa\u2019s hunger for belonging and her struggle for survival as a first-time mother, Flook searingly evokes her search for a safe haven, her many tumultuous relationships, and the evidence linking family, strangers, lovers, suspects, and innocents to the tragedy that both shocked a seaside town on Cape Cod and horrified the nation. Flook intricately maps Christa's charged life before her death and follows the first year of the murder investigation with the help of the district attorney who is in an election battle even as he searches for the killer. At the same time, Invisible Eden captures the Cape's haunted landscape, class stratifications, and never-ending battles between its weathy summer residents and its hardscrabble working families who together form a backdrop for a powerful chronicle of love and murder. An edgy and compelling portrait of a woman's tragic journey, Invisible Eden is a mesmerizing true story.From the Hardcover edition.", "title": "Invisible Eden", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1113116.Invisible_Eden", "average": 3.02, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1181100928l/1113116.jpg", "reviews": 50, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/214361.Maria_Flook", "name": "Maria Flook"}], "type": ["Crime", "Nonfiction", "Mystery", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1113116.Invisible_Eden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/376045.Invisible_Eden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6414838-invisible-eden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8557389-invisible-eden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7606299-invisible-eden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840881.My_Sister_Life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/552818.Lux", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1190875.Open_Water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1194337.Family_Night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2144028.Reckless_Wedding", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205082-everything-is-horrible-and-wonderful", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
