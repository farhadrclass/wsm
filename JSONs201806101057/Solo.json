Thinking was not enough though, I had to blast this extremely talented, sexy and beautiful out of my speakers with an addition of extra bass.That is probably due to all the Lenny Kravitz references Solo has that makes me picture our main character Blade Morrison as younger version of Lenny. And that ain't a bad thing. I mean is there anyone who does not a) like Lenny Kravitz and b) think he is damn and too beautiful for a man?Even Solo is a story of Blade's (a son of a addicted rock star and guitar virtuoso) journey of finding himself from the hills of Hollywood into the jungles of Ghana, what Solo ultimately is, is a poetic love song to everything Rock and Roll.Solo is quite a lot of this, only the miserable side of it that we can't much laugh about:Solo is quite a lot of guitars:Solo is quite a lot of the teenager love that hardly ever ends good:Solo is told in poetic verses, and even though I did not find much beauty in it, I adored how rock and roll references moved the story along. If you know your rock, you will no doubt enjoy this one quite a much.(although one could argue that Metallica references should be done through Master of Puppets instead of Enter Sandman, but then again, it would not be never-never land).From the first world problems to the third world problems, I truly enjoyed this piece of only few words. There is a lot of things that should annoy me, there is a lot of things that speak favor for critical eye when mirroring humanitarian aid, and this was a very welcomed point of view from my part.Sometimes it does not require a lot of words to tell a meaningful story, and Kwame Alexander is an great example of that.Fan of rock? Need some books for your boys? Keep on rockin' with this one, and you should be more than fine."}, {"userName": "Kate Olson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13650342-kate-olson", "userReview": "Thank you to the #kidlitexchange network for the review copy of this book - all opinions are my own. SOLO is a rip-through-the-pages, can't-put-it-down poetic YA masterpiece. Told in text messages, song lyrics and conversations in verse, it tells the story of an alcoholic and addict rock star's son. Blade has been burned by his father time after time and is still actively mourning the death of his mother years before, when he receives life-changing news that sends him on a quest across the world. This book completely blew me away and showed me a side Kwame Alexander I haven't read before, and introduced me to the work of Mary Rand Hess. The soundtrack of this book is a who's who of classic rock and roll and stuck in my head the entire time I was reading. For teen readers, this would be a great introduction to the rock classics they may have not been introduced to yet.

This book, however, had characters who were so outlandish I found it hard to even want to care about them. I understand that the book is about Blade's self-discovery, but does he really need to travel halfway across the world to realize he's got a good thing at home? His sister calls him out on \"first world problems\" almost immediately, and things don't sink in until he's in Ghana. Oh, honey. One more criticism: Everyone talks about how brilliant Blade's songs are, but the samples we get are pretty bland. Alexander knows how to write poetry, and there are some beautiful sections in Solo, but none of them show up as lyrics. It's kind of a let down, actually. The audiobook tries to make up for it by turning Blade's lyrics into actual songs (with guitar and everything), but they get repetitive real fast."}, {"userName": "Bridget", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4823153-bridget", "userReview": "Kwame Alexander has a thing, poem (or in this case lyric) packed books with particular appeal to teenage boys. That is such a wonderful thing! The boys at my school lap up his books, he writes sport so beautifully and he has such great things to say to his audience, thing like, you can be great even if you are not the greatest at this one thing, it is ok to show weakness, you don't have to be That Guy all the time - you can be you and it will be fine. This particular book is the story of a young man who has it all, he has money, he is loved, has talent and who is the son of one of the world's most famous rockstars. He is about to graduate high school and it should be the beginning of fabulous new and exciting times at college, unfortunately the challenges in his life have become more than just annoying, his dad is living the rock and roll lifestyle to it's extreme and has used every rehab available, his sister has made the most cringeworthy record and there is plenty more to deal with, but that is ok, life is still ok, isn't it? Then love makes a fool of him and his poor hurt heart needs to heal. The next bombshell hits and he realises that there is healing to do that he can only do by himself. What he decides to do is brave and wild and will change his life forever.It is a really good book, I liked it slightly less than The Crossover, but that was always going to be a hard act to follow. Kwame is awesome. Thank goodness for Kwame and for his making reading cool for some of the most non-readerly boys.

I loved The Crossover, but this book seemed to be overly dramatic with the plot. I didn't connect with these characters much at all because they felt much more like caricatures instead of genuine people. Positives & Negatives - + I love the way real songs are scattered throughout the book. I pulled them up and listened to them while reading and it made for a really interesting experience.+ The idea that this is a music family fits perfectly with the verse format since it\u2019s so lyrical. + I absolutely loved the little music trivia bits dropped into the story. If the story was more that and less angsty drama, I would have been happy.- The characters are really really cartoony and stereotypical. Some of the events just seem over the top. - The PK is literally named Chapel\u2026 and Blade & Chapel's romance is very toxic. - Is he really going to have cell phone reception in a village so remote he had to walk 3 miles to get there and without changing his SD card to an international card?- The plot was all over the place and didn\u2019t flow well\u2026. Hard to explain more than that without spoiling it, but the \u201cconflict\u201d changed about five different times without any real resolution.

There, he becomes aware of the disparity between his life and those in the town, but Blade also begins dealing with his mental turmoil.

He's kind of have a lot going on his hands, like trying to juggle sneaking with his girlfriend (her parents hate him) and keeping up life with his father and his many addictions. Paparazzi bombard his life one embarrassing news of his father after another, making their family a tabloid laughingstock. Blade can barely keep up, what with the turmoils of young love and family problems and then one day everything he believed in became a lie. So comes a journey of finding meaning in life and music halfway around the world. And finding happiness in unexpected places.This is a YA story, told in a somewhat poetic-verse, text messages, and song lyrics. At first, I didn't like it because it felt like the author is trying to make the story seem a lot more special, extraordinary than what it really is: just a privileged teenager whining about everything wrong in his life. You see, the writing style struck me somewhere between Michael Faudet's and Lang Leav's style. The whining sounded like Faudet, just a lot more innocent and not perverted in any way. And the more profound and lovesick parts reminded me of Leav. The protagonist was kind of annoying to me, at least until 40% through. Blade's a bit self-absorbed, lost in his so-called \"end of the world problems\" and never seems to realize that he's acting like a jerk more often than he could admit. He's also super privileged, thanks to his father's rock and roll stardom. And although he declares that he despises everything about his father, he can't make up his mind about the comforts it brings to his life. Like when his girlfriend was upset, he offered \nto take her shopping in his father's Maserati.\n Hmm...I'm just glad his old friend Robert took him on that and called out his bullshit: let me get this straight. You're living up in Hollywood Hills with a pool and tennis court, and a lady to clean your underwear and cook you tacos on Tuesdays, and you're living in hell. You got first world problems, Youngblood.\"And still, Blade shoved a wad of hundreds of dollars in his friend's trumpet case even after he said he don't do charity. *facepalms*He can't own up to his actions and gets upset when people call him out. Like when his sister Storm said, \n\"I'm sick of his holier-than-thou-we're-all-bad-and-he's-a-saint attitude. He benefits from our lifestyle, and pisses on us.\"\n And Blade never said sorry after bursting on his father and sister, and making them crazy worried after he busted out. Dude, you're sick.I'm probably making it sound way worse than how it really is. I'm sorry, I just really have a low tolerance for whiny-ass characters. PLEASE DON'T BE DISCOURAGED BECAUSE IT GOT BETTER! THANK HEAVENS!My favorite bit has got to be Confession: Everybody loves music, Blade. Music is story.It is the language of love and happiness.Me and love have not gotten along too well; happiness isa foreign country, and my passport hasexpired.Blade quickly matured before my eyes. He's thrust upon a life-changing journey where he got to make new friends, repair his relationship with his family, see life in a different light, and the disproportionate correlation of money and happiness.Now I liked it way more than I thought I would.But why only 3.75 stars? That must be because there were so many rock and roll/music references for my taste. If you're well versed in those, then I think you'll like this even more. Also, I wished there was was more. Not enough of an ooomph for me to give it a higher rating.

Coming from a \"rockstar\" family, including his father struggling to stay sober, & a sister who's trying to follow in her parent's footsteps, Blade would do anything to get away from them. Enter convenient plot lines! Blade finds out that *gasp* he's adopted. His wish has been granted, now all he needs is to sever the ties with his girlfriend, Chapel, which isn't really a problem anyways considering the fact she's seeing another guy. Now Blade is free to head off to Ghana (don't forget there's no planning to this; just running off & not thinking about anything) to track down his biological mother. It's difficult to enjoy books with characters that are so self-absorbed (his sister even mentions the privileges Blade holds but he refuses to see it)- I guess in some sense I can feel a *twinge* of empathy for him since there's a small part of me that understands wanting to stay away from a parent fighting addiction. But still. The whole of this book is just ridiculous & it takes Blade going halfway across the world just so he can see the grass isn't always greener on the other side? Seriously!?! Thankfully, it was a fast read. It's clear Alexander can pen poetry & I enjoyed the soundtrack/musical facts incorporated, but unfortunately it wasn't enough to overlook my loathing for the Morrisons. Also, for a verse novel, the pacing is a bit inconsistent. Rapid, then slow (I felt a chunk of 30- 40 pages dealing with Blade & Chapel's relationship could have been cut out entirely & no substance would have been lost), then rapid in going to Ghana, finding his mother, then realizing he's got a pretty good life back home.

His recent books have all been middle grade, but this newest is young adult for sure! I really, really hate to say this, but this book was just okay for me. I feel like it needed to be more focused on one specific thing instead of about three to four different things. Seriously, he had me at music, especially since it is the type of music I really enjoy, and I am fascinated by rockers who have lavish lifestyles...BUT...I am concerned that the teens are not going to relate to the music. If the teen is a music buff, it will be okay, but the others will be put off by it. This book is also more far-fetched than his others. If it had just focused on the relationship with the dad, I would have really enjoyed it. Even if it had focused on his girlfriend, or going to college, I would have liked it...BUT...(I'm not giving anything away.) the other part of the story a world away was too much for me. It was just too much going on for me to really like it. All of that being said, I think it will be very popular. It might be more popular with a specific group of teens, but I'm sure it will be read by a lot of people. *Note to librarians...in my opinion, because of the subject matter, this book is for teens.
