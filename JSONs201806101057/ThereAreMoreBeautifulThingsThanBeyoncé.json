I thought from the title Beyonce would be used as a launching pad to reference the problematic ways women exist in media. This isn't a rebuke of Beyonce which the title hints at. This book used Beyonce and other pop culture references, in a way that didn't resonate with me. I wasn't familiar with some of the references, but the ones I recognized didn't make sense in the context.The poems centered around race and womanhood were thought provoking. However none of the language resonated with me in a emotional way. It's hard for me to pin point what I didn't enjoy in this poetry collection. The way people experience poetry is subjective and personal. So my opinion will certainly differ from other readers. The topics and stories told in these poems were important and reflective. We need more poets addressing issues of black womanhood. I enjoyed some of the poems but wished I was more drawn in and connected to others. Recommended for Readers Who-enjoy modern poetry-appreciate thoughts on race and womanhood-resonate with pop culture references"}, {"userName": "Nenia \u2728 Queen of Literary Trash, Protector of Out-of-Print Gems, Khaleesi of Bodice Rippers, Mother of Smut, the Unrepentant, Breaker of Convention \u2728 Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190064-nenia-queen-of-literary-trash-protector-of-out-of-print-gems-khalees", "userReview": "I requested this on Netgalley - and they rejected me!

I took some closeups for Instagramming purposes :)I liked the engagement with Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga etc. that the book is generally praised for, but something else also struck me that I don't see mentioned in reviews - I felt that at times this book had an approach that seemed inspired by queer and trans work on femininity, without the author actually being queer or trans (AFAIK?). I have been expecting something like this to happen as QUILTBAG work becomes more and more mainstream, that now even straight people get inspired by it, but this must be the first time I see it in a non-genre poetry book (Feb 2017 release.) The author cites Audre Lorde etc. so this was surely a conscious inspiration. It did not strike me as appropriative (unlike e.g., the discussion just now in my Twitter feed where straight people want to be called queer because they are kinky) but rather that discourse about gender has been broadened out by QUILTBAG people allowing straight, cis, non-intersex etc. people also to engage in this broadening, and contemplate their gender in ever more complex ways. Does this make any sense?? I think this is a positive development and very cool to see.Source of the book: Lawrence Public Library"}, {"userName": "J Beckett", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22450975-j-beckett", "userReview": "Read Morgan Parker's \"There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyonce,\" until you memorize every word, get swallowed in every mood, and exist in a fantastic reality not yet defined! Without exaggeration, Morgan Parker is-- *expletive*-- amazing. Morgan's poetry reminds me of hearing my real voice and meeting my hidden personality while wandering through the late 80s and early 90s New York city: gritty, pleasant, affectionate, deadly. I have heard her work before, that incredible voice echoing, bellowing or whispering from the speakeasies that were planted from SoHo to Harlem, on trains that seemed to have no destination, and in parks where voices and emotions just wanted to be heard before forever silenced. I know her work because she speaks the language of familiarity and truth. And if you think her truths are not yours, keep reading -- you'll catch on.

There are the rare exceptions, of course: stories written in verse, and the occasional feminist title; see, e.g. The Princess Saves Herself in this One. But mostly I shy away from it, since it makes me feel ... not the sharpest tool in the shed. That said, between the title and the cover, There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyonc\u00e9 proved pretty much impossible to pass up. While I'm sure I missed out on many of the cultural references - I'm white, and this is a collection of poetry about black womanhood - and didn't pick up all the varied and more veiled messages that Parker was putting down, I enjoyed it all the same. I read it cover-to-cover three times in two days, and with each successive reading, discovered something new. Parker's poetry sparkles and shines and cuts more deeply, the more time you spend with it.It's hard to play favorites, since each piece has at least one or two especially memorable lines. (To wit: \"At school they learned that Black people happened.\") But among the poems that really stood out to me are Hottentot Venus; Beyonc\u00e9 On The Line for Gaga; Afro; These Are Dangerous Times, Man; RoboBeyonc\u00e9; 13 Ways of Looking at a Black Girl; The Gospel According to Her; The Gospel of Jesus\u2019s Wife; White Beyonc\u00e9; What Beyonc\u00e9 Won\u2019t Say on a Shrink\u2019s Couch; It\u2019s Getting Hot In Here So Take Off All Your Clothes; The Book of Revelation; 99 Problems; and the titular Please Wait (Or, There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyonc\u00e9). There are forty-two poems total, twenty-five of which have previously been published elsewhere. For those keeping count at home, thirteen have Beyonc\u00e9 in the title. The Beyonc\u00e9/Lady Gaga mashups are fun, if only because I enjoy imagining them hanging together - or swapping bodies in a Freaky Friday twist.I feel like I should say more but idk how to read poetry, let alone review it. There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyonc\u00e9 is a fierce, funny, and subversive collection of poetry. You don't need to be a member of the Bey Hive to love it (but it sure doesn't hurt). It's earned a permanent spot on my Kindle so I can return to it as needed over the next four to eight (please dog no) years. \u00a0Table of ContentsALL THEY WANT IS MY MONEY MY PUSSY MY BLOOD The President Has Never Said the Word Black Hottentot Venus Another Another Autumn in New York Poem on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Birthday Lush Life Beyonc\u00e9 on the Line for Gaga We Don\u2019t Know When We Were Opened (Or, The Origin of the Universe) My Vinyl Weighs a Ton Beyonc\u00e9 is Sorry for What She Won\u2019t Feel Afro These Are Dangerous Times, Man Rebirth of Slick RoboBeyonc\u00e9 Delicate and Jumpy Freaky Friday Starring Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga 13 Ways of Looking at a Black Girl The Book of Negroes The Gospel According to Her Black Woman With Chicken The Gospel of Jesus\u2019s Wife White Beyonc\u00e9 The President\u2019s Wife Welcome to the Jungle Beyonc\u00e9, Touring in Asia, Breaks Down in a White Tee What Beyonc\u00e9 Won\u2019t Say on a Shrink\u2019s Couch Ain\u2019t Misbehavin\u2019 Untitled While Listening to Drake Beyonc\u00e9 in Third Person Heaven Be a Xanax Beyonc\u00e9 Celebrates Black History Month Earth Wind & Fire Reunion Tour 2013 It\u2019s Getting Hot In Here So Take Off All Your Clothes Take a Walk on the Wild Side The Book of Revelation 99 Problems Slouching Toward Beyonc\u00e9 Let Me Handle My Business, Damn Beyonc\u00e9 Prepares a Will Please Wait (Or, There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyonc\u00e9) Funeral for the Black Dog So What\u00a0http://www.easyvegan.info/2017/02/13/..."}, {"userName": "Ken Stampe", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53562294-ken-stampe", "userReview": "I don't think Morgan Parker woke up one day and said, \"I'm gonna write poetry that Ken Stampe will like.\" I'm willing to conceded that I may not be the target audience for this book.But...I love poetry and thought I was pretty open-minded about poetry. I use Kendrick Lamar, Tupac Shakur and even Beyonce in my English classes. But not one poem from \"There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyonce\" will make it inside my room.So many of these poems were impossible for me to relate to. Where I struggle with accepting the rave reviews of this book as poetry is in the amount of unbalanced, unrhymed, disconnected poetry in this book. It seemed to rely more heavily on celebrity names like \"Robo Beyonce\" or \"Freaky Friday Starring Beyonce and Lady Gaga\" then on any actual poetic devices. The index of poems was more enjoyable than the book of poetry. Here is an excerpt from \"Rebirth of Slick\"\"I was born this way: unsatisfiedMy color is a bridge with no other sideIn a second life my voice is a drum kitReigning over green hills like weatherI am king & anthemI know how to relax\"This is the last stanza of five and makes no sense to me. The imagery is inaccessible and disconnected. Why is this even a stanza? I can't see the connection woven from first line to last let alone through the poem and they are all similarly odd.The exception are the poems \"Afro\" - a humorous and creative short piece, and \"All They Want is My Money, My P****, and My Blood\" which despite it's title is a moving and passionate piece.Overall, this seemed like a money grab, trading on celebrity names. It read like urban hipster trying to out-urban and out-hipster the reader. I'm sure I just don't get it, wasn't supposed to get it, and those that loved this book are probably THRILLED that I don't get it.

My point is I have no frame of reference so this could be terrible poetry that everyone who's anyone in poetry circles knows is terrible and I would neither know nor care.But I think it far more likely though that the poetry loving world is already well aware of Morgan Parker and her delicious, diva voice. Reading her poems out loud is amazing. You feel like you're the star of the poetry slam and you can't help it but your voice gets all Lin Manual Miranda doing a freestyle and you almost want to start dancing cause saying these words just make you feel good and they've got an intoxicating rhythm.These are angry and hopeful poems that fly back and forth across the black American experience stopping to comment on sexuality, the absurdity and horror of the racial divide, the quest for sexual and emotional connection and, of course, the titular Beyonce and our obsession with her.I think the mark of good poetry for me will likely be how many times I pick up the book again to reread something because god knows I picked this one up often enough."}, {"userName": "D.A.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/583092-d-a", "userReview": "\"Art hurts,\" wrote poet Gwendolyn Brooks, \"Art urges voyages.\" Morgan Parker's poems hurt deeply and voyage widely.

The rhythm, the thoughts expressed, come together to make moving, exciting poems.

Although I often needed to keep my phone with me to look up many of the current vocabulary (I now know many more contemporary slang words than I did before-although not, apparently, rivaling my daughter's who was often more useful than the web), I understood (or believe I did) much of the passion that drives these poems.I strongly recommend this book for anyone, simply because they are wonderful, but also because they deal with important issues."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/891502-kathleen", "userReview": "I love this book so much I'm teaching it in my Intro to Literature class.

This collection explores femininity and race in the contemporary American political climate, folding in references from jazz standards, visual art, personal family history, and Hip Hop.
