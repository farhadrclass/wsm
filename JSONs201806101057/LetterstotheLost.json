When Jess finds a box of old letters while hiding in an abandoned house to escape her abusive boyfriend , we are transported back in time to the heartrending love story of Stella and Dan a U.S. Bomber pilot flying missions over Europe. I usually think stories told through letters are tedious, but this book finds just the right mix. I'm not surprised that several of my Bookclub's have chosen this as their monthly read. I was sure this was a 5 star read until about 3/4 of the way through when things started to feel a bit rushed and perhaps a bit coincidental as the modern romance takes center stage. That said, I predict this book will be highly rated by most and I'm happy to say the final wrap up manages not to disappoint. 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Lidia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34110739-lidia", "userReview": "Son 4,5.

Otherwise they might never read it - and that would be so dreadful. Letters To The Lost by Iona Grey is published by Simon & Schuster on 23 April in paperback and for kindle: it's a substantial read, 560 wonderful pages, but it could have been twice as long as I never wanted it to finish. We all read for different reasons, but one of the things I love is the way you can live inside a book for as long as you're reading it, entirely leaving the real world behind - and when this book ended, I cried my eyes out because everything had been so perfect. For three thoroughly blissful days I was totally lost in the wartime love affair of Stella and Dan, aching for them with every obstacle and injustice they encounter, my heart in my mouth waiting for Ruby Shoes to return safely and for Dan to write his next letter. The author does a magnificent job of recreating wartime Britain, peopled with vividly drawn characters and with just enough well-researched detail to bring it all to life: I loved the detail around the preparations for the fete (and the arguments over scones and ginger cake), the preparing of food, the effect of rationing (and the value of tinned peaches), the impact of the blackout. But she also conveys the very different world Stella inhabited - the moral unassailability of the church, the expectations of women, the challenges of being \"different\".The book opens with Jess - a character you quickly get very attached to - running away from her present day problems, finding refuge in a deserted house, and stumbling across the wartime story of Stella and Dan after discovering a box of letters. The structure is really clever - as Jess reads the letters we read them with her, the gaps are filled by our visits to Stella's world, and the whole book moves totally seamlessly between the two worlds. With a thoroughly gripping and unashamedly romantic story line, the whole book is beautifully crafted. Sometimes with dual timeframe stories you find the shift from one to the other can be a wrench, or you prefer one storyline over the other - in this book there are no such problems, I was every bit as interested in how the story of Jess and Will played out as I was in Stella and Dan. It's quite amazing that this is a debut - Iona Grey is an incredibly accomplished story teller, and I'm looking forward greatly to seeing what she does next. This is a book you really mustn't miss - I loved it.

It was a little too Nicholas Sparks for me, not sure how I ended up with this on my reading list... I should probably put a note about that when I add a book. I know it was a different time, but Stella was hard to take. She was such a mousy person who could have spoken up once, at several different points during the story, and everything would have been fine. Right down to the central split in the book. She created this situation and it was so unnecessary. Contrived plot crises are bad, but the thing about this book that really got me was the use of the lazy-writers crutch, the perfectly timed coincidence. When that happens in a book, it really almost kills it for me. It's so sloppy. The latter half of this book was just littered with them, one after another.

Despite the trigger warnings listed above, I actually enjoyed this one and thought it was a good read. Set between the year 2011 and WW2, Jess has escaped from a toxic relationship and taken shelter in an old house that has been left abandoned. During her hiding away, she stumbles on a collection of letters including one recently sent by Dan, a pilot from America that fought in the war many years ago and wanting to connect again with his long-lost love Stella. Jess decides that to move on with her life, that she needs to track down this Stella. In the process, she meets Will, working for an heir hunting company and recently got the keys to the house that Jess has been hiding in. Together, they work to solve the mystery. The novel does flip back and forth between the 1940s and 2011, but the events of WW2 were utterly heartbreaking. It did warn on the cover that the story would break my heart, it certainly did that.The pacing did drag, hence why I decided not to give Letters To The Lost a full five stars. For a standalone novel, the plot twists kept me interested right until the very end. I also love anything to do with ancestry and tracing relatives/missing people, so that appealed to me throughout as Jess and Will were doing some research into past records.

When she discovers a packet of letters hidden in a drawer, she is drawn into the love story of Stella and a young American airman, Dan. When a letter arrives at the house from Dan making one last appeal to reconnect with Stella, Jess is determined to find her. Alternating between Jess's hardships and her determination to make a better life, and the sorrows that befall Stella in the choices she made, it is a lovely depiction of the strength of the human spirit. At the core of every person, it is the desire for love and acceptance that drives our decisions and actions. Loneliness and despair can bring such great sorrow into our lifes.

She reads the letter and wishes she could find out more about the person it was intended for and the man who wrote it. So begins a story that goes between the two times lines, 2011 and the 1940s. In that earlier time American bomber pilot Dan Rosinski, met and fell in love with Stella Thorne in London. But Stella is already married to Charles. I suspect I may be in the minority in not liking this book more than I did. Somehow some of the characters never really came alive for me. That included Stella and her clergyman husband, Charles. As a result I never became emotionally involved in this story. It never swept me up into it. I have often been known to cry at books but this one left me without a tear. The writing is good and the historical info is fine but I found the reliance on co-incidences weakened the effect of the story.

Set against the backdrop of London, Letter\u2019s to the Lost is a love story that transcends time, that is both beautiful and heartbreaking.He was an American bomber pilot, whose chance of survival was only one in five. She was newly married. They met by chance, and didn\u2019t mean to fall in love, especially with everything stacked against them.This story was lovely, so beautiful, emotional and quiet a bit heart breaking.We follow two time lines. In our main time line, we follow Stella, who is a young woman during World War 2 that comes from the poor school so all she really wants is a family and a roof over her head. She marries Charles the preacher and her marriage is off to a rough start right from the beginning. Stella does not seem to understand why Charles treats her more like a housekeeper instead of a wife, with no physical relationship between them, including during the wedding night.When her husband volunteers to be a Chaplin during the war, Stella is further confused why her new husband found volunteering and leaving her behind so easily. Plus his friend Peter seems to be a very big influence in Charles\u2019 life.She meets Dan, an American bomber pilot during his brief break while searching for her bracelet, that she happened to lose during an unfortunate encounter. The attraction is instant, but it takes a bit for them together. It started with a bracelet, which led to letters, to a sort of friendship that morphed into a beautiful but heartbreaking relationship.I was glued to the pages wanting to know what happened between them and the fate that awaited them in the end.I do love how the author explored the relationships during this time period, as well as some stereotypes. Stella is pretty shy, quiet, kind of meek. She just wants a family and a home life as oppose to other women during this time that took on much larger roles and filled the shoes of men when they went off to war. So in that respect, that take on her character growth and how she progressed on events that surrounded her was really interesting.The second couple we follow is Jess and Will. Jess escapes from an abusive relationship and stumbles into an old abandoned house running away from her boyfriend with nothing but 50 pounds in her pocket. While squatting in the old house that seems to be trapped in time, she finds a letter delivered by the postman entitled, Urgant, please forward if possible. Unable to help herself, Jess opens the letter and finds herself invested in its author and finding what happened between Stella and Dan. Through her, we get to see Dan\u2019s side of the letters, as she reads them. With the help of Will, a man who she meets while he is trying to find the owner of the house \u2013 together the two investigate Dan and Stella\u2019s story while slowly growing attracted to one another.I have to say, I adored this book so much. The writing was so wonderful, Stella and Dan were both wonderful. I don\u2019t usually like books with affairs, but once you get the whole picture between Charles and Stella and everything that happens, the pieces fall together and it makes Stella\u2019s and Dan\u2019s story all that much more heartbreaking \u2013 especially during this time when Stella felt she had very little rights.I found Jess\u2019 and Will\u2019s story good enough. They weren\u2019t the main focus of the book and I felt if it wasn\u2019t for the way the book was structured, I would have been fine with Stella\u2019s and Dan\u2019s story alone, seeing as how that was the main focus and my favorite part. The characters were much more fleshed out and I found myself emotionally attached to the two of them. Also, I found parts with Jess and Will a bit slow moving.I don\u2019t know if I can say that this story has a completely happy ending, but I did like the way things wrapped up, despite a few tears shed at the end of the heartbreak and pain the two had suffered and the unfairness in all of it.I highly recommend this book to all Historical Fiction readers who love a good story set in two different times and enjoy a timeless romance.I received this book for free from Publisher in exchange for an honest review.

Beginning and up to probably 40% was a solid 4-stars with competent writing and intriguing plot that kept me glued to the pages. But this didn\u2019t hold up.I don\u2019t generally like dual time line stories because I don't think many authors handle it all that well. It\u2019s rare when both time lines presented as equally competent, interesting, and engaging. Usually, one dominates the other and so the weaker one becomes just a nuisance, a place to skip to get to the \u201cbetter\u201d part. Unfortunately, the novel was not an exception to the rule. The present day story paled in comparison to the 1940th one. And the further the story went, the more emphasis was put on the present time line, the less interesting the narrative became. But it\u2019s not only this. What started as intriguing story of hardship of the war, of moral choice dilemmas gradually turned into full-blown melodrama with contrived plotline. I feel like I stepped into the world of Nicholas Sparks. The promising heroine who could\u2019ve been such an intriguing one, regressed into someone with no backbone, someone who made choices that left me scratching my head.There were too many coincidences, too much \"deus ex machine\" used to tie up loose ends and get the book to its eventual conclusion.

It blew me away from the first page and along the way it tore out my heart. Stella and Dan\u2019s story is an unforgettable tale of a love so profound and powerful that it spreads over a lifetime regardless of decades spent apart. Narratives with a dual time frame have always been a favourite of mine, they are without fail positively fascinating, no matter what novel I have read I have always found both timelines equally exciting and compelling and this one is no exception. Letters to the Lost is set in London during World War II and the present day (2011). Jess our present day character escapes her abusive boyfriend and comes across an abandoned house and a mysterious letter. Jess unearths other letters which leads to an intriguing war time tale, determined to solve the love story Jess finds her own true love. Jess and Will\u2019s story, perhaps not as compelling as Dan and Stella\u2019s is sweet and charming nonetheless and an integral part of the novel as they try and locate the woman in Dan\u2019s beautiful letters.It\u2019s hard to believe this is a debut novel as it is exceptionally well written and I\u2019ll be more than looking forward to reading Iona Grey\u2019s next novel.

There is something quite mesmerising about romance during the war; that amongst the violence, the death and the poverty that love can still find a way to flourish.Transcending two generations, the reader is introduced to Jess, an aspiring singer fleeing from her violent and controlling boyfriend. With nowhere else to go, she finds refuge in an abandoned house and discovers a box of love letters. With the help of heir hunter Will, they set to find out the the story of the two sweethearts and fill in the gaps the letters had left.At times shocking and sad, although uplifting at the same time, I thought the author did well to write such a complex novel. There are multiple threads to her storyline but her ability as a writer make it easy to decipher. The only aspect that holds me from awarding this a full five stars is that I was able to predict some of the story and the actions of its lead characters. Nonetheless, I still thoroughly enjoyed it and wouldn't hasten to recommended it to fans of historical romantic fiction."}, {"userName": "prettybooks", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16942564-prettybooks", "userReview": "20/20On lit rarement une histoire d\u2019amour si belle, si absolue.

It is a story that spans sixty years, and is over 500 pages long, but the pages fly by so quickly as the story captivates the reader, you will become totally engrossed.Letters to the Lost is a love story, it is romantic to the core, but it is also a story of struggle, of pain, of lost opportunities and of heartbreak. Iona Grey is a truly gifted writer, her ability to create this story as her debut is incredible. Her characters are startlingly realistic, and her sense of place and era is spot on - transporting the reader to England during World War II, and then whisking them back to the same London back streets, but in the modern day.The story is told as a dual time narrative. The reader meets Jess first, she's on the run from an abusive relationship, with little money and only the clothes that she stands up in. Jess has no family to turn to. She takes refuge in an almost derelict cottage, part of a mews terrace, hidden from the busy streets of London. It is in this empty and neglected house that Jess discovers the story of Stella and Dan; war-time lovers whose story does not have a happy ending.A letter arrives from Dan, now ninety-years-old and in ill-health. Dan has thought about his lost love for the past sixty years and wants nothing more than to track her down before his time comes. When Jess discovers an old shoe box filled with the letters that Dan wrote during the war, she becomes determined that she must help him to find Stella.Iona Grey slips back and forth from Jess's modern story to the wartime romance of Dan and Stella with ease. There are parallels between Stella and Jess; their poor background, their lack of family and their history of abusive relationships tie them together. Jess also recognises a kindred spirit of sorts in Will - a college drop-out, a disappointment to his wealthy family, but a kind and considerate man, and between them they set out to discover just what happened to Stella at the end of the war.There are many issues dealt with within Letters to the Lost. The difficulties of life during the war time years, the difference between the US soldiers and the British men, the inequalities that women faced, the prejudices directed towards some people and the stigma attached to invisible illness that were not understood. Iona Grey handles each of these with grace and elegance, her story telling skills are very impressive, she has written a novel that is quite stunning and very memorable.Fans of Lucinda Riley will adore this book, Letters to the Lost is a sweeping, majestic story, I highly recommend this one."}, {"userName": "Selma Sljuka", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62174959-selma-sljuka", "userReview": "Jaooooo jedna od onih knjiga od kojih se naje\u017ei\u0161 i koja te bukvalno odnese u neki drugi svijet.
