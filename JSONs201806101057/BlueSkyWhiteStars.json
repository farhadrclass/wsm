WOW!!! If you only budgeted your money for a few high-quality children's books this year, you might want to consider putting Blue Sky White Stars at the top of the list. Absolutely Breathtaking! Gorgeous and intricate, emotive artwork. Profoundly moving, sparse yet powerful text. This stunning book drew tears to my eyes, and swelled my heart with pride. United - ONE NATION - yet beautifully diverse. Indeed, \"Land that I love . . . \"With each painting, I was inspired to remind readers of the resilience of American principles . . . our strength lies in our willingness to embrace our differences. I hope this work will always remind us that our ever evolving country was forged by - and for - people from all walks of life and every background . . . \" ~ Kadir Nelson, Illustrator FIVE ***** Powerfully Stunning, Gorgeously Rendered, Children's Picture Book Worthy of Accolades and Praise ***** STARS"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1434969-beth", "userReview": "Kadir Nelson's illustrations always stir my soul and move me to near tears.

But this . . . Kadir Nelson's illustrations are always, always perfect, but even he outdid himself on this one -- inclusive, breathtakingly brilliant and beautiful, and full of emotion. Sarvinder Naberhaus's simple but powerful text plays on words and the concept of America. My one gripe is that I wish there were a more clear nod to our Indigenous brothers and sisters, but this book . . . Wow. Stellar. Stunning.

I went into this knowing nothing other than it's getting Caldecott buzz. So first few pages I'm like, \"oh ok, this is kind of nice.\" Making me feel kind of good about the flag, which is unusual. Then it goes on and I'm feeling kind of good about being American, like maybe not the entire country is a big garbage fire, which is very unusual. Especially in the \"All American\" and \"Stand Proud\" spreads, especially the Doctoral graduate. But then they hit you with the eagle/flag/fiery rocket cloud spread, and the good feelings start to waver. And THEN your whole situation is totally unseated by the astronaut staking claim to the moon in the name of \"FREEDOM\" \"FOREVER,\" reminding you that what America is most about is moon imperialism."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1753322-amanda", "userReview": "Oh the illustrations.

I love my country and I love the possibilities it represents, the ideals that it strives for but never quite seems to meet. But I\u2019m terrified of the people who use their own patriotism as a bludgeon to hurt others, as a weapon to keep their fellow Americans down instead of lifting them up. Blue Skies, White Stars,/i> brought me to tears as I read it, its few words paired with pictures that reminded me of the best of our country and of the truest distillation of what we can be. Perhaps this picture book just hit me at a very susceptible moment (year) when I\u2019m especially vulnerable to the simple emotions that it inspires. Certainly, my kids were not nearly so moved. Sure, they liked it, but didn\u2019t get mommy\u2019s overreaction to its simplicity; its few carefully chosen words evoking so many interconnected feelings paired with the faces of Americans that represent all of us. And that\u2019s okay. I\u2019d rather they not share my manic highs and lows and just take away the beautiful images of the many, many different people and places that our country contains. I\u2019m glad that they can see this book as simply an amazing depiction of beauty. In conclusion, Kadir Nelson is a goddamn national treasure and I\u2019m grateful this book exists."}, {"userName": "Lorie Barber", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/367437-lorie-barber", "userReview": "GORGEOUS.

The double pages pair with each other, sometimes with the same words, sometimes with clever wordplay. For example, it begins with the title words, \"blue sky white stars\" with an illustration on the left of the Statue of Liberty shown against an evening sky, and a close up of blue sky, white stars in folded fabric with the same words. \"White rows\", also repeated shows covered wagons in a row, with the white rows of the flag on the opposite page. My favorite page, \"sea waves\" is a lovely ocean, but the companion page is of the flag waving, illustrating the words, \"see waves\". From Civil Rights' Marchers to a raised flag, from a flying eagle to the moon landing, the words and images bring forth the best of patriotic feelings, and for younger readers, topic sparks for more questions. It's a wonderful new book. Included are author and illustrator notes, plus another that added information can be found on the author's website, although in a search, I could not find her site. She does have a short blog post she's written showing some other of the book's pages, and you can see more pages on Google."}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6509032-tiffany", "userReview": "Kadir Nelson\u2019s illustrations are breathtaking."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10381638-kristin", "userReview": "WOW!

Illustrated by award winning Kadir Nelson, this story highlights the various features of the flag in a unique and beautiful way. From looking at the front cover, you see a multiracial crowd, both young and old, gazing up at the night sky. One should not dismiss the little boy that\u2019s sitting up on his father\u2019s shoulders holding a small American flag. As you flip to the back cover, you can see how it highlights the same flag while you see the silhouettes of the entire crows looking at a beautiful fireworks display. One could think that this book is solely about the fourth of July. In actuality, the book encompasses the many ways the American flag has been and continues to be such an important symbol in our nation. Although there\u2019s not a great amount of written text, the story and its wonderfully illustrated pictures make strong connections between the colors and elements of the flag. I love how the words on the left-hand page of the book connect to those on the right page by using features of the flag. For example, on the first two pages of the book, the words \u201cBlue Sky, White Stars\u201d are displayed, but the left-hand page shows Lady Liberty and a starry night sky. The right-hand page shows the blue fabric and white stars of the flag billowing in the wind. Even though there are only 28 words in the entire book, Naberhaus does a great job highlighting important settings and subjects that represent the United States of America. This book would be great in a K-5 classroom setting, as this book lends itself to a number of great instructional opportunities. Research Project 1: Students could take one setting from the book (Statue of Liberty, NASA, the Civil War) and write a short paper about their findings, connecting the importance of the American flag into the paper. Students would then highlight their findings on chart paper and would create a class book about the flag and its connections to these settings. Research Project 2: Students could research the meaning behind the thirteen stripes and fifty stars and write a paper on their findings, incorporating features of the book, including our independence. They would then present their findings to the class. Read Aloud/Jot a Thought: I would hand out copies of the Pledge of Allegiance and would read this as a whole group. I would pick out key words and ask students what they thought they meant, writing key words on the board. We would read the book together and the students would then jot a thought about one takeaway from the book on a post-it note after the reading. I would then have a group activity where we would create an American Flag out of cut out stars, red and white stripes, and a large piece of blue cloth. I would then invite the students to say the Pledge of Allegiance to connect the importance of the flag and the Pledge.This was a WOW book for me because the text and pictures cover so many important aspects of not only the American flag, but the history of how our freedom came to be. I don\u2019t think the curriculum (for lower grades at least) covers such important topics these days. You could use this book to teach so many valuable lessons (freedom, ethnicity, gender, symbolism, history) to a variety of grades."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3539261-katie", "userReview": "Fabulous new patriotic picture book, written in simple parallel text describing both our great nation and Old Glory.

The text moves from describing the nation and its flag to the various natural beauties of its land. The people of the nation come next. A well-worn face of Lincoln next to the well-worn flag that is tattered. People march on the streets, other attend a baseball game and still others are the face of America on its porches. Faces of all colors and creeds fill the pages until they return to the flag, our shared purpose and freedom itself.This is one of the most patriotic picture books I have ever seen. The words are so simple and yet speak so profoundly of all that the United States holds dear. The illustrations for these words are truly exceptional. Each page is a wonder, and turning the pages is like visiting a gallery of Nelson\u2019s work. They are filled with the faces of America, symbols of our nation, and the beauty of the land.Awe inspiring, patriotic and grand, this picture book is superb.

Naberhaus, an Indian American immigrant, and Nelson, an African American illustrator, begin with iconic images of our country, showing how elements of the American flag resonate today. Paired images make clear associations between America's values and the diversity of our people, honoring all who have helped shaped our country. The layered meanings of the text and images will lead to interesting conversations--about why the artist chose these images, and how they show our country changing and evolving. Sarvinder Naberhaus has put together a wonderful collection of resources to complement this beautiful book: Blue Sky White Stars website. Teachers will especially enjoy using this to deepen conversations with students.
