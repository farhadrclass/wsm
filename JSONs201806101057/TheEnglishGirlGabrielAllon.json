Now I must wait for the next. I always enjoy reading about places I have been. It also references my favorite book/movie...A Room with a View. Overall a good read with the usual twists and turns, but lacking in the typical Allon antics, spyness, and restorations. I was really hoping for more in the English Girl. Overall I recommend, but if you have not read the Gabriel Allon series by Silva, do not make this your first read in the series.

I feel a bit differently. It had to happen sometime: after 13 books with the same character, this is the FIRST in the series that seemed like a \"paycheck book\" to me.The Gabriel Allon series is one of my favorites which is odd considering most of what I read is outside of this genre (I prefer scifi). Gabriel's character has aged in the previous 13 novels so you cannot expect the character to react to situations in the same fashion as when he was younger. Also, there are only so many times that a character can be brought back in \"for one more job.\"While I did find the character development to be interesting and the author does a pretty good job of explaining the backgrounders for other relevant characters that \"pop-in\" to this particular storyline, the story itself was pretty predictable -- a first IMO after reading this series.Given how things end, I hope the author has the good sense to allow Gabriel Allon to retire soon. The overall body of work is quite good (Daniel Silva is said to have reinvented the \"spy thriller\" genre with this series and I wholeheartedly agree) so I hope he doesn't drag the series out in the name of paying off the author's pied-a-terre or country home (see also: the first three novels of the Dune series vs. the crap Frank Herbert's son puts out).-g"}, {"userName": "Drew", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54293-drew", "userReview": "While all the Silva books tend to blend together in my memory, he has a great formula and sticks to it. His formula as I see it follows these steps:1. Semi-retired Israeli spy (Gabriel Allon) has sworn off spying and is engrossed in his 2nd career as art restorer.2. Someone from Allon's past asks him a favor to solve some international crime/stop some international terrorist.3. Allon hems and haws, but finally agrees to do the work.4. Allon determines the source of the crime/terror and vows personally to destroy them.5. Allon assembles a crack team to surveil, set-up and take-down criminals/terrorists.6. Plan goes almost perfect, but there with a few hitches. Many, many, many bad guys die.7. Wash, rinse and repeat. The English Girl follows these steps again. For future novels, Silva has set up his character to take over as the director of the Israeli intelligence service. It should provide him fodder for many more \"Gabriel Allon\" novels."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "[I spent most of this book with a sense of dread, because Silva telegraphs early and frequently that Madeline will not make it out of this book alive. First there's the reference to the \"wrath of God\" mission, which a character says was about \"vengeance, not justice\" - ie, it didn't do any good to the Israelis who were already dead. Then we have Gabriel restoring a painting of Susannah and the elders. And of fucking course we have an old lady who tells fortunes and says that Madeline will die, and of fucking course all of her predictions come true, because this is a book, and in books the psychics are always 100% real and never just con artists exploiting desperate people for money. So I was sure that Madeline was going to die, and I was sure that, ultimately, it wouldn't even be about her death, but about how her death made Gabriel Allon feel bad. Luckily, Silva pulls a fast one on us and actually lets Madeline make it out of this book alive, but it still felt deeply unsatisfying. Silva doesn't fridge Madeline, but he might as well have - he presents us with this brilliant character who, it turns out, was a Russian spy all along, and then doesn't let her do jack shit. When Allon tracks Madeline down in St. Petersburg and confronts her, all she has to do is make doe eyes and claim that she never wanted to hurt anyone and the mean bad men made her do it, and she totally wants to defect to England. This is Allon's cue to reply bitch, you were part of an international conspiracy to undermine the British government, hell no you don't get sanctuary in England, and then he tortures her for information because that's exactly how the male spies get treated in this book. But of course, none of that happens. Allon gets the whole team together and spirits her out of Russia on Israel's dime and convinces the British government to let her defect and gets her a lovely cottage in Cornwall as a safe house. I was waiting until the very last page to find out that Madeline had played him like a fiddle and Allon had put the entire British government at risk because he was stupid enough to fall for her damsel in distress act. But no. Madeline is, at the end of the day, nothing more than a princess in a tower, needing to be rescued by Flawless Hero Gabriel Allon, who tortures people and commits murder and conspires with criminals but for totally noble reasons so it's all okay. Independent assassins are evil, and government spies are good noble people who have your best interests at heart and should be able to do whatever they want, as far as Silva is concerned.

He's an intelligent writer, he has both intriguing plot development and engaging characters, his main characters grow and evolve (and age!), and he always leaves me ready for the next book. To me, one of his core strengths is that even though his characters are set in the world of espionage, they don't succeed because of the latest gadget or technological wonder. They use their brains, experience, wiles--and then the gadgets. They are good at what they do because of carefully honed skills, and that sets him apart from other writers who rely on superhuman heroes with rippled abs and talking watches. I also like that his plots are well crafted, with enough detail to support the story but not so much that it appears he's trying to impress with his latest research - those paragraphs that cause me to flip to the next page. He seems to understand his readers' interest in knowing just enough but not too much.If I were starting to read Silva for the first time, I'd go back to the beginning of Gabriel Allon's story rather than starting here. Even though there is backstory in each book, the real depth of his writing skill becomes apparent across the series."}, {"userName": "Jim A", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5496710-jim-a", "userReview": "It\u2019s hard for me to describe my feelings about Daniel Silva\u2019s latest novel, The English Girl. It doesn\u2019t really fit the mold of other Gabriel Allon novels. This one starts with Allon doing a favor for Graham Seymour of British MI-5, who is doing something for the British Prime Minister. It seems the Prime Minister\u2019s mistress has been kidnapped. The first thing Allon does is take on a partner, but not one of the members of \u201cThe Office\u201d that he usually uses. This time it\u2019s a professional assassin who once tried to kill Allon.Silva also writes the Allon character a little different than in previous novels. Gabriel is a little more full of himself; \u201cI\u2019m Gabriel Allon, I only do big\u201d. He also gives Allon a bit of a sense of humor; \u201cJews don\u2019t camp, Keller. The last time the Jews went camping they spent 40 years wandering in the desert.\u201d That quote makes my list of all time favorite book lines. Halfway through the book the real Allon comes out and he decides he needs to go back to Moscow to continue looking for the kidnappers. Those who are familiar with the series will know the danger with this decision. It also comes with a personal price. To get the sanction of the government of Israel for this mission, Gabriel has to promise Shamron that he will seriously consider becoming the head of The Office. Again, long time readers will recognize the significance of this. At this point all of Allon\u2019s merry band join him and the rest of the story plays out. All in all it was a very enjoyable weekend for me, spent with Gabriel, Chiara and other familiar characters as well as what may turn out to be a new regular in Allon\u2019s adventures, Keller the assassin."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17042835-tim", "userReview": "An excellent story by an excellent author with an outstanding main character in Gabriel. 10 of 10 stars"}, {"userName": "Linda Root", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20450380-linda-root", "userReview": "It is hard to give less than five stars to any Gabriel Allon book. If I were rating this against any other writer, it would be a five. Unfortunately Silva himself has placed the bar so high that a five would be phenomenal. This is not the best of the Gabriel Allon books, but it does not miss the mark by much. I find myself waxing nostalgic for the melancholy art restorer persona of the early works or the damaged Gabriel hiding out in Cornwall until Chiara comes to save him from his ghosts. I miss Julien Usherwood, yet going home to Israel opens a while new set of possibilities for a Gabriel who is no longer young or quite so intense. Since I am not longer young or intense that works fine for me and it obviously works for Silva. So what is missing in this fine new addition to the saga? For me, it is the element of suspense, because I had the basic plot mapped after about 40 pages into the story, certainly not with such certainty that I was ready to put the book aside. And in any case, I read Silva's books for the sheer joy of reading Silva. There are some characters I found tedious. I am not turned on by Corsican thugs--Napoleone Bonaparte finished that off for me when he shelled the Sphinx. Nor do I expect Gabriel to be perfect. After all, the man is an assassin. I do not blame him for sitting down with Ari Shamron and putting his own future on the table in order to get support for his plan, but I like it less when he barters with the Corsican don for the lease of his favorite henchman. On the positive side, I was ever so grateful to Silva for not subject the character Mikael (Michael) to the endless tortures he usually endures or letting the poor guy wallow in his quasi romance with the American CIA agent. The absence of more than a token appearance by some of the characters we usually see was actually welcome. I like the fact that almost everybody gets almost all of what they want when the plot resolves and that the ending neither foretells or forecloses the next appearance of an older but every bit as interesting Gabriel Allon. I rarely shell out 11.99 for an ebook, but this is the exception, and I do not feel the least bit cheated."}, {"userName": "Dana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/731559-dana", "userReview": "I waited til the right time and place presented itself before settling in with my yearly Daniel Silva book ... This annual treat needs to be savored, knowing I won't get another update to Gabriel Allon's story until the following summer. But once started, I can never stop ... I read this book yesterday - all 496 pages. Last year, I enjoyed Silva's The Fallen Angel, but was reminded with every page that it was the TWELFTH in the series and it was feeling very formulaic and predictable. I don't know if Silva felt it, too, but The English Girl was injected with some freshness, as well as a little more humor and witty repartee than in his other books. I was really glad that someone \"new\" played such a big role - I know Keller made an appearance in a previous book, but his large part in this one was a welcome addition to me. I enjoy the team Gabriel assembles in each book, but it was nice to expand on the storyline of some fresh characters. I don't mind that Silva's stories are biased towards Israel, but I was glad to take a break from that theme with The English Girl. Fans of Gabriel Allon should enjoy this book - and friends, if you've never read one of Daniel Silva's books, feel free to start with this one. I'm not a fan of \"spy\" stories - but Silva's series starring Gabriel Allon, an Israeli spy, are SO much more than books of intrigue and secrets.

It means looking down my nose at it. What I read is literature; what you read is \"genre lit.\" I'm teasing. And owning up--a little.The purpose of this book is to give the reader thrills of suspense. The character development serves the plot, and sometimes the action serves to ratchet up another few seconds of suspense, whether it serves the plot or not. That suspense is supposed to keep the reader turning the pages. I may or may not have, except that I got the book on audio from the library and listened to most of it during a car trip, with the book there, too, for clarifying a name or plot point as needed. A good friend and Silva fan had given this book to me for my last birthday (a year ago!). That made me want to read it--now a fait accompli. And it made the miles roll by. That it did.What's the good of genre lit? First of all, it's better to read than not to read. Suspense thrillers could be the entry drug that makes someone into a hardcore reader.Probably you learn a little something about Russia in this book. It is a matter of some importance to the author that post-USSR Russia not be romanticized, and if anyone was doing that, the events of the last year or so would have set him or her straight and ratified the author's vision. This LA Times article on Russia was reprinted in my paper just as I was finishing up The English Girl.The author also paints the dilemmas and struggles of the country of Israel in more sympathetic colors than the left would like. In fact, they wouldn't particularly care for his picture of world politics in general; say, of Western countries being friendly with Israel. Is Daniel Silva a \"neo-con?\" Only in the sense that, as one moves further toward the political left, there is no \"liberal\" or \"center-left\" position behind one, only neo-con territory, so that everything to the rightward of whatever one's own political position is, is called that. Still, it could be more effective to ban Silva than Sodastream or hummus. Daniel Silva's books prove Israel's problem is not the result of a lack of PR.This book suffers from being two books stuck together. One part of the plot ran out before readers could be given their money's worth of thrills, necessitating something new for the second half of the book.To be fair, some reviewers say this isn't the best Silva and that he subsequently returned to form. He has a verbal tic of, having come up with a witticism, repeating it multiple times. I doubt if that's limited to the present book. For example, a bug-free room in which the spies could speak freely in the Israeli embassy in London is the \"holy of holies.\" It hits home the first time. Or another character asks the hero if he doesn't drink champagne. He says, no, it gives him a headache. The other party says, \"Me, too,\" all the while pouring a glass. Stop while you're ahead!For the easily confused late-comer, shilling for former books in the guise of references to past adventures clutters up the plot line and makes it harder to remember the characters.Why does the author have his hero ask another character, \"Since when do you eat shellfish,\" when that character has not evidenced a shred of religious observance otherwise?And yet those attempting to meet with a superstar oil magnate are said, with a jarring authenticity, to be waiting to \"sit at his feet.\" Still and all, now I've read a Silva!Although my tone in this review has at points been dismissive, Silva's thrillers were best-sellers from the very first one, enabling him to resign from journalism and producing CNN talk-shows. When one of his new books comes out, library queues of several hundred people form. He's considered the preeminent writer of international thrillers. And for the sake of authenticity for his hero, who's an art restorer as well as a spy and assassin, he gets input from an art expert in the know.For more information:http://www.bookreporter.com/authors/d...http://www.washingtonpost.com/enterta..."}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1327296-cathy", "userReview": "Okay, so this is another spy novel with lots of assassin killings; not my favorite things. But the difference between this one and the Mitch Rapp series is that the main Office of CIA types is not American but from Israel. I take it Silva is Jewish. And certainly, we do feel much more confidence in the Israeli intelligence group than our own CIA/FBI or even the British MI5/MI6 folks. Why? Because they do what they say they are going to do, and they act out of intense self preservation (think Holocaust), and leave the shackling Political Correctness OUT.The other thing I like about this novel is that the true \"evil-doers\" in the world are unmasked and denuded, i.e. the Russians. Are they not at the heart of every evil we face today? They weaponize the Iranians, who weaponize the Syrians, who kill anyone resisting them, or if it suits the Rushkie's purposes, they supply the Al-Qaeda nut-cakes, or anyone else who seems intent on destroying their fellowmen. It feels really, really good to see someone, even if that someone is fictional, kick their bad butts! These are the true super-heroes of the day.Also interesting, although author disclaimed, is to try and figure out who in the political scene today is being brush-stroked as a fictional character in the story. I think Putin is clearly painted. Current British Prime Minister - who knows? It is very notable that Silva has none, NO, not-a, even a hint of American intelligence involved here. (Maybe there isn't any, J/K) This could very well indicate the current feeling Israelis have against our current administration which is weak and feckless, and therefore the intelligence is weak and feckless, and continually embarrassed by leaks from traitors who go unpunished.

The weather was excellent, the beach was composed of fine-grained sand, and the waves advanced and rolled back in a peaceable manner. In short, the lark was on his wing, the snail on his thorn, and God was in Heaven.The second of the two books was Daniel Silva's new story in the Gabriel Allon series. I read The English Girl quickly, as I don't think Silva ever intended his books to be read slowly. It was an enjoyable read, par for the course for Silva. His Allon stories are shot through with a certain amount of sadness which, I think, makes them stand out from the regular crowd of thrillers. The sadness comes from the combination of Gabriel Allon's life--the life of a frustrated artist and art restorer who must work, instead, at killing and destroying instead of creating beauty--and the larger setting of modern Israeli practicality, the practicality of a small country always forced to make dreadful choices in order to stay alive.The first half of the book was excellent, laying out the story of the kidnapped Madeline Hart, the involvement of Allon to find her, and her startling death. The second half of the story, Allon's revenge against her killers, felt slightly cookie-cutter to me. However, this is typical of Silva's books. The second halves tend to follow the same routine: the involvement of the Mossad, Allon pulling his team together (always the same cast of characters--though, in this book, we at least had the welcome addition of Christopher Keller, the ex-SAS soldier), summary judgment and execution.Still, The English Girl is a very satisfying read and I recommend it unreservedly for those who appreciate thrillers. The addition of Corsica as one of the plot setting was a very nice touch. I can almost smell the sage and heather of the macchia countryside from here.One last comment. I appreciate Silva's thrillers for many reasons, but chief among them is that he writes from a moral perspective. Right and wrong, good and evil, however they are complicated by issues of nationalism, etc., are respected in his stories. That, for me, is important and refreshing."}, {"userName": "Kirstin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13783306-kirstin", "userReview": "Do you like spy thrillers, but feel they lack culture? Do you ever wish your spy characters were skilled in music and art as well as clandestine intrigue and killing? It's time to start reading Daniel Silva's spy thrillers starring Gabriel Allon, master art restorer/forger and Israeli assassin/spy!\u00a0The English Girl\u00a0is the 16th Gabriel Allon now, but Silva does a good job filling in key elements of the backstory in a few lines. This novel starts with a kidnapping for ransom, gets tangled up with the Corsican mafia, spends a while with a complicated secret identity scheme, and ends with a massive twist! The Russians get to be the \"bad guys\" in this one, giving it a very classic spy novel feel.The \"spy\" aspect of Daniel Silva's writing- the classic tradecraft, political wrangling and double-crosses- brings to mind LeCarre, but with a little more killing and fewer tedious descriptions of blind drops and old men talking. The \"thriller\" side of his writing- the car chases, assassins, and twists- reminds me of Ludlum, with more reliance on fellow spies and more finessed kills. Gabriel Allon is a character of depth and experience. The recurring supporting cast in the stories is well drawn, especially Allon's mentor Ari Shamron.\u00a0After years of coaxing and scheming, it seems like Shamron might finally have talked Allon into becoming chief of \"The Office.\" Allon is getting older, and there are developments in his personal life that might keep him closer to home, so I can imagine that Silva might\u00a0 finally write him in to that role. However, I'm sure circumstances would require his presence on the field of operations often enough to keep things interesting.It doesn't really matter if you've always wanted to read about an art restorer spy assassin or not.

Yes, the usual tropes (Gabriel's reluctance to be involved in the latest operation, Sharon's chain-smoking, Chiara's beauty, and the memories of the tragedy that left Gabriel without a son) are all present. But, Gabriel seems to have become a wiser, deeper person as the series developed.In this latest installment, Gabriel -- that improbable combination of art restorer and secret agent -- gets involved in the bizarre disappearance of a rising star in the English political firmament. A combination of meticulous planning, derring-do, and improvisation are of course required for Gabriel and team to unravel the situation. Of course, the situation is more complex than it appears, and major geopolitical forces are involved, so both diplomacy and tradecraft are required.Daniel Silva has created a character with a pleasing blend of morality and ruthlessness. Gabriel always wants to do the right thing, but when he has to do something nasty, he does. And then feels bad afterwards. As such, Gabriel comes across as less ambiguous than the usual Le Carr\u00e9, John protagonist -- but much less flat than the heroes that occupy the likes of Vince Flynn."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/747648-jeffrey", "userReview": "In the increasingly crowded thriller genre, Daniel Silva is an author to count on.While Silva's last book delved into a smuggler plot at the Vatican, Allon shifts gears here to the kidnapping of Madeleine Hart, who is the mistress of the English Prime Minister.

After the drop, Allon is told where to get Hart, but is ambushed by a shocking explosion.Allon now takes it upon himself to figure out what happened and wants to get revenge on the kidnappers.Of course, Israel is reluctant to commit its resources to Allon's plan unless Allon agrees to become the new head of Mossad.After assembling the familiar cast of characters, Allon soon learns some interesting facts about the kidnappers and their country of origin, and must somehow defeat them. There are double agents and some surprising twists and turns. Its a quick read.Silva's ability to switch from a plot involving Hezbollah and the Vatican in the prior book to a scenario involving England and double agents and spies is a mark of his singular talent. This volume has all of the familiar Allon plot elements, but it all works."}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4856939-carrie", "userReview": "As promised, this is a decent thriller that will probably please fans of the author. I was a little hesitant to start book 13 of a series and while it is a stand alone book, I think the character development has been stretching over the series so much that I was left a little cold by all of them. The back stories for the characters are included, and in fact were kind of an issue for me. If I had read all of the books I think I would have been annoyed by the regular retelling of long past events. Still, if this is a library book, you will not think it is a complete waste of time, it is a gentle, easy thriller. For me, I prefer my thrillers to be a little more mysterious. I also prefer the story to not focus exclusively on one character, in this case, the hero. I wanted to read the panic in the prime minister and the desperation of his minions. I also think this book suffers from way too much foreshadow, nothing was surprising and the twists and turns are very obvious. Not only that, I never felt there was much danger involved for the main players. But hey, if you are sitting on a plane for hours, you could do worse, much worse."}, {"userName": "John Connolly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8329824-john-connolly", "userReview": "I\u2019m something of a fan of Daniel Silva\u2019s Gabriel Allon books, even if, as often happens with an ongoing series, the structure of each novel is pretty standard: Allon, an art restorer and Israeli agent, is pulled reluctantly into some case of international terrorism; bad things happen; he gets his gang together; and vengeance is meted out. Actually, leaving out the international terrorism element, that could describe most mystery novels, my own included. In Silva\u2019s case, this is all accomplished with a considerable measure of style, and no small amount of tension. He\u2019s very good.Here\u2019s the thing: I don\u2019t believe in the concept of guilty pleasures. If you like something, and it doesn\u2019t do anyone else any harm \u2014 or, indeed, yourself \u2014 then it\u2019s fine to like it. If anything about the Allon books makes me slightly uneasy, it\u2019s a general tendency to paint the Israelis entirely as a force for good, and the Arabs or Russians as pretty much uniformly bad. Now I\u2019m no expert, but I suspect the geopolitical situation is slightly more complex than that.

I felt it for the first time when I was 6 years old. At that age, I progressed in a few months from reading \"See Spot Run\" to reading 'big books,' that is, chapter books for much older kids. My rapid evolution wasn't due to anything special about my intelligence, alas. It was due to the joy...the delight and pleasure...of being grabbed by a well-told story.That joy inspired me with a longing: the longing to write novels. It's that joy and that longing that have led me through my life. Literally. I came from a family where no one had gone to college in generations, and I went to Yale at 17 because I was so motivated by the joy and the longing intrinsic to reading and writing.I still read continuously. I also read indiscriminately. It's all market research. Unfortunately, so much popular fiction inspires only boredom and the same kind of icky self-loathing you get after eating a Big Mac and a shake, or a Twinkie.I say it regularly: there are good reasons why the legacy publishers are foundering. The poorly written, gimmicky popular books, and the unlikeable protagonists, faux depth, poseur angst, and, well, general self-important silliness of that which has been anointed as \"literature,\" are among the reasons.But there are great writers writing great fiction: Sue Grafton. Richard North Patterson, when his work isn't too self-reflective and self-congratulatory.Then there is Daniel Silva. I opened The English Girl yesterday and by the middle of the first chapter, all that juicy joy and longing had erupted within me. This reader was delightedly and gratefully in the hands of a Master.The English Girl is beautifully written, line for line. It's a pleasure to read on the level of appreciating well-crafted prose. Silva has a fine ear for music in the language, and his diction is thoughtful and often quite lovely.Best of all, this novel works superbly as a story. It sets out the stakes right from the beginning, and then the screws tighten, and the suspense builds. The characters are three dimensional, unique, and unexpected. They don't quite ever get what they want. Gabriel Allon, the wry and likable art restorer-spy, wants peace. I doubt he'll ever get it.Remember: those are two of my rules for writing novels: One, story is how your protagonist does NOT get what he or she wants, and two, what are the stakes?So I recommend The English Girl. It's an exciting five star read. It's engrossing. It makes you think and it makes you care. It's fun!"}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1050198-linda", "userReview": "The English Girl is author Silva's thirteenth novel featuring Gabriel Allon, the brilliant, honorable, and ruthless Israeli intelligence operative. The book opens with a summons from number 10 Downing Street. The PM has been conducting a secret affair with Madeline Hart, a political aide who was just kidnapped while on holiday in Corsica. Hoping to keep this potential scandal from the press, the Brits are calling in a favor, asking Allon to find and rescue Madeline. Reluctantly, and against his better judgment, he agrees. What follows is a kind of Russian doll of a situation, made up of plots within plots that grow ever more perilous,Just as Allon is the consummate master of his trade, so too is Daniel Silva. There is no writer working today who is better at crafting a credible, mesmerizing thriller, one that reads like a James Bond movie. Allon, his wife Chiara, and his team, are by now old friends of readers, serve as the hook on which to reel us in. But Silva's secondary characters are equally three-dimensional, and in this case include the killer for hire who recently targeted Allon, the Don of the Corsican underworld, and a peasant woman who can read the future in a bowl of water and olive oil. The exotic settings, which Silva brings to life with rich detail, and the intricate plots that never grow stale or predictable, add to the enjoyment. As for the icing on these cakes, the geopolitical situations underlying all the intrigue provide the moral reason for the mayhem.All of the Gabriel Allon novels can be read as stand-alones, but, for the richest experience, it's best to take them in order. Highly recommended for those attracted to literary thrillers."}, {"userName": "Scott Parsons", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18665948-scott-parsons", "userReview": "Another brilliant novel by Daniel Silva. Superb writing, plotting and characterization. This is the thirteenth in the Gabriel Allon series. Familiar characters like Shamron and Chiara and the team from the Office (Israeli intelligence) but others like characters from the Corsican underworld and Keller the English assassin who once had a contract to kill Gabriel but didn't carry through.A rising party star in the UK, Madeleine Hart, who happens also to be the mistress of PM Jonathan Lancaster is kidnapped while holidaying in the Mediterranean. Ultimately a ransom is demanded. Graham Seymour of MI-5, on behalf of the PM, approaches Gabriel Allon to launch a mission to rescue her. Gabriel recruits onetime enemy, now friend, Keller to assist him. They track Madeleine to an out-of-the-way villa in France but when they mount an operation to rescue her they discover she has been moved. Gabriel is then tasked with delivering the ransom but before he gets to the car where Madeleine is supposed to be there is an explosion and all that is left are the charred remains of a young woman.But nothing is what it appears. The real suspense occurs when Gabriel sets out to track down and punish the abductors. There are many plot twists including one that almost defies credibility but is believable nonetheless. To say any more would spoil the story.Highly recommended. The best of the Allon series in my opinion."}, {"userName": "Robert Intriago", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3076319-robert-intriago", "userReview": "Mr. Silva finally takes a turn away from his usual plot of Muslim terrorists and deals with a different story. The prime minister of Great Britain is being blackmailed for his involvement in an extramarital affair. Gabriel is asked to investigate and try to rescue the prime minister's girlfriend.The book is divided in two parts. The first part deals with the rescue and it is quite light and humorous. The second part deals with the heavy and serious action of finding the actual kidnappers. I enjoyed this book in part because it is fast moving, humorous, full of action and has a well developed plot. The part that I liked the best is the departure from the usual story of the saving of Israel. I personally was getting bored with the usual stories and in my review of the previous book, stated so."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue", "userReview": "At first I wasn't sure what to make of this latest in the Gabriel Allon series.
