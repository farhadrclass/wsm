Whole-ass one thing.\u201d So I decided to dedicate my sole attention on this tale, and it was beyond magical.\u2022 We have a phenomenal first chapter from the pov of eleven-year-old Virgil Salinas with a supporting grandmother that tells of her dreams and stories!!\u2022 We also have an incredible cast of diverse characters who\u00a0won over my heart:- Virgil Salinas is shy and kindhearted and feels out of place in his loud and boisterous Filipino-American family.- Valencia Somerset, who is deaf, is smart, brave, and secretly lonely, and loves everything about nature.- Kaori Tanaka, \u00a0whose family is Japanese-American, is a self-proclaimed psychic\u00a0with a\u00a0little sister Gen\u00a0as her second-in-command.\u2022 Can we take a minute to talk about how Kaori is one of my favorite characters...\u00a0I genuinely had the bouts of insta-love\u00a0the minute this\u00a0twelve-year-old\u00a0that\u00a0doesn't sound like a\u00a0twelve-year-old\u00a0because, as she likes to say,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m the reincarnated spirit of a 65-year-old freedom fighter\u201d was introduced!!\u201cKaori was mildly surprised to get a text from one of her clients (her only client, truth be told) on the first day of summer, particularly at seven forty-five in the morning. But the night before, just as she was gliding to sleep, she\u2019d had the vision of a hawk perched on a giant fence post. Only now she realized it must have been a vulture, not a hawk. And vulture started with V, just like Virgil\u2019s name. The connection couldn\u2019t have been clearer.\u201dThis girl\u00a0with\u00a0\u201cher powers of second sight\u201d is something else...\u2022 \t the humor is\u00a0on point: \u201cSomething will happen to you,\u201d Kaori continued.Virgil looked at Gen. She shrugged.\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d said Virgil. \u201cSomething will happen to me?\u201d\u201cI see darkness,\u201d said Kaori.\u201cYour eyes are closed.\u201dHonestly, dare I\u00a0say iconic... both for making me laugh out loud and for the subtle\u00a0foreshadowing thrown in from the author (which I'd thought at first to be just her\u00a0having a laugh). But circling back to the humor, these brilliantly vivid\u00a0characters\u00a0reminded me of the kids from Stranger Things\u00a0being their best selves on TV!!\n\n\nAnd:\n\n\n\u2022 \t And moving on to\u00a0Virgil's Lola - aka the best\u00a0literary grandmother ever - she was a force of nature. I could always count on her\u00a0old ghost\u00a0stories and dreams to fully capture my spirit. Also, she's just one hell of a supportive adult!!! \u201cSorry, Lola,\u201d Virgil muttered. \u201cI was just thinking about something that happened on the last day of school.\u201dLola tossed the garbage pizza in the cart. \u201cWhat? What happen?\u201d She was always ready to hear gossip, no matter where it came from.\u201dThis is me. This is who I am.\u2022 \t So as\u00a0Kaori had foretold to\u00a0Virgil -\u00a0\u201cWhat I mean is, I see you in a dark place.\u201d\u00a0\u201cDark how?\u201d\u00a0\u201cJust dark.\u201d - he'd\u00a0gotten trapped at the bottom of an old well thanks to the worst of humans throwing Virgil's\u00a0backpack,\u00a0which had\u00a0Gulliver,\u00a0his pet guinea pig, in it. Which is also when I noticed what\u00a0the\u00a0cover, though absolutely gorgeous, happens to spoil if you'd skipped reading the blurb. \u2022 \t Oh, and circling back to the worst of humans, I have only one thing to say to the bully, Chet Bullens, whose family\u00a0is\u00a0probably full of\u00a0Trump supporters\u2026 \u2022 \t On a more positive note, there's some magical realism aspects thrown in to further enchant my heart. \u2022 \t And the story continues full of busy\u00a0happenings that lead to friendship, kinship and family. In the end, I just ended up adoring\u00a0this group of explorers. Plus, I really hope\u00a0Tanaka and Somerset will go into business as\u00a0promised. (Maybe we'll even\u00a0get a sequel/ novella on that idea...) \u2022 \t And last but not last, I was as joyful as my girl Valencia from\u00a0Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\u00a0when\u00a0the story ended\u00a0on such sweet and hopeful note.

I see such books as teetering on tightropes --- balancing just right the heartstrings-tugging, the poignancy, the tenderness, the provoking-of-tears. Too much and I feel manipulated, too little and I\u00a0just don't care. It is for this reason I was wary when beginning Erin Entrada Kelly's Hello, Universe, but I needn't have been. It is to my mind an exemplar of this sort of book ---- quiet, introspective, moving, witty, and emotional in all the right ways. I liked it so much, in fact, that I've added it to my goodread's Newbery list. \u00a0Yes indeed, I think it is that good.The novel takes place in a single day featuring four middle schoolers. In the center is Virgil Salinas, a highly introverted member of a large extrovert family who call him Turtle \"Because he wouldn't 'come out of his shell,' Every time they said it, a piece of him broke.\" The exception is his\u00a0Filipina grandmother Lola who calls him Virgilio, gets him completely, and tells him folk tales to bolster him through life's challenges. Virgil has a crush on deaf and confident Valencia Somerset, but is too shy\u00a0to let her know. And so he has become a client of the young physic Kaori Tanaka who, with her younger sister Gen, intends to help him. Last of all there is Chet Bullens who has bullied Virgil unceasingly.An encounter in the woods with Chet leaves Virgil in a life-threatening situation. Readers are firmly with him as he reacts to this, tries to figure out what to do, and considers some of Lola's tales as a way to build strength in a dire moment. Here is where my admiration for Kelly's writing really takes hold as she masterfully balances the emotionally of Virgil's circumstances on that tightrope without a misstep. The threads of the other characters move in and out of Virgil's difficulty. We get in Chet's head and, while we learn more about what may have turned him so mean, we don't forgive him for it. Kaori's adult-like serene style\u00a0is delightfully balanced with her little sister Gen's humorously\u00a0typical second-grader behavior. Interestingly, while these character storylines are all in third person, Valencia's is in first person; from her tolerance of her father\u00a0calling her an endearment she could do without to her forthright response to Chet, we easily see how crush-worthy she is.There is suspense as we hold our breath wondering how Virgil will be saved, there is humor (especially from little Gen), and there is the slow evolution of different personalities, and of what will be, we can be certain, a warm friendship between Virgil, Valencia, and Kaori beyond the book's ending. It may be this is a book for introverts? I can't say, but it provided all that I want in a book for children --- an intriguing plot, beautifully articulated characters, tight and elegant sentences, wit, and opportunity for thought.\u00a0Hello, Universe is one quiet, emotional book that I recommend highly."}, {"userName": "Connor", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22027176-connor", "userReview": "Wow I was surprised by this book!

There are very few Newbery contenders/winners I have read recently that I have thoroughly enjoyed and thought fit the criteria of being a distinguished and lasting contribution to American literature for children. I suppose there isn't much wrong with this book per se, I just thought it was boring and a chore to get through. There is a lame conflict to begin with, one-dimensional characters that are pigeon-holed by one defining characteristic or personality trait, an anti-climactic climax, and a pat ending.The pacing of the first third of the book was too slow for me. I just didn't care that much about Virgil's problem and none of the characters were very relatable to make me want to keep reading about them. I do think that some readers would identify with the characters, but I personally didn't. I liked that we got a glimpse into Chet's relationship with his Dad in order to have some explanation for his bullying. I've come to realize that I like my villains to be fleshed out so that I can understand their motivations, so I'm glad the author didn't just have him be the bully because that's the formula for a middle-grade novel about friendship.The pacing did pick up about 1/3 of the way through and I was able to power through the remainder in one evening. However, my motivation was more to just be done with it than because I was actually enjoying the story or wanting to know what happens beyond casual interest. Then, the climax was not much of a climax and all of a sudden the characters changed and were happy. It all seemed a little too neat to be truly satisfying. I think there are worse books that have won the Newbery (Last Stop on Market Street, anyone?), but that doesn't mean I'm happy that this did win."}, {"userName": "Victoria Scott", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4658088-victoria-scott", "userReview": "If you're a writer, this is a great book to teach you about \"pure\" plots.

Blackbird Fly (2015) and The Land of Forgotten Girls (2016) were her two previous novels for kids, both well-received enough that it wasn't surprising when her third book sparked conversation that it could contend for the Newbery prizes. Sure enough, Hello, Universe won the most significant children's literature award of its time, introducing Erin Entrada Kelly to many readers (myself included) who had yet to experience her storytelling. Fate is as much a character as any human in this story of five kids who discover over the course of a summer day just how entwined their destinies are. Events line up too neatly to be coincidence as new friendships are forged and old problems resolved in a single twenty-four-hour period. It all begins and ends in these pages. \"That's the problem. People don't want to listen to their thoughts, so they fill the world with noise.\" \u2014Ruby, Hello, Universe, P. 195 Virgil Salinas isn't as happy as an eleven-year-old should be for the end of the school year. He wanted to make friends with Valencia Somerset, a girl in class, but couldn't gather the nerve to talk to her. Virgil is the quietest member of his passionate, boisterous family, so reserved that his nickname at home is Turtle, a moniker he dislikes but has never asked his parents to stop using. The friendship he wanted with Valencia didn't happen in school, but Virgil knows someone who might be able to help: Kaori Tanaka. She attends private school, so she doesn't know Valencia, which is just how Virgil wants it. Kaori, assisted by her little sister Gen, claims to be psychic, but even if Virgil is skeptical, he'll try her if it means he might speak with Valencia before the long summer ends. \"Crying is good for the soul...It means something needs to be released. And if you don't release the something, it just weighs you down until you can hardly move.\" \u2014Ruby, P. 246 Valencia and Virgil share a problem besides not fitting in socially: Chet Bullens. Chet harasses Virgil for being quiet and Valencia because she's deaf. He doesn't trust that girl: what if she's faking to get sympathy or be allowed leeway by teachers who don't want to be mean to a handicapped student? Chet loathes the idea that she could be receiving undeserved special treatment. Virgil lives not far from Chet, and the morning he heads out for his psychic appointment with Kaori, he takes pains to avoid the bully. If only that had worked. It wouldn't be so bad if Chet just threw Virgil's backpack down the old well, but only Virgil knows that his guinea pig Gulliver is in the backpack. Is his pet dead? This sets off a chain of events that Virgil gets the worst of, and soon he's in danger of more than being pushed around by a mean kid or not befriending a girl he likes. Virgil's life could be in jeopardy if Kaori and Valencia don't happen to meet by what most would call random chance, and discover together that the design of the day's occurrences has been anything but random. These kids may all yet become friends via a sequence of events that would be too outlandish to believe if fate weren't writing the story to satisfy its own wise ends. \"If you didn't have bad things, you wouldn't have good things. They would all just be things. Did you ever think about that?\" \u2014Lola, Hello, Universe, P. 83 Kaori isn't the only one sensitive to the universe's whispers. Virgil's grandmother always seems to sense what's going on with him. She sees her grandson's potential and tells him stories from their Filipino culture to remind him that virtue leads to reward. Most of her stories aren't memorable outside the context of this novel, but at least one has broader meaning. It's about Paulito, who was one inch tall but desired to be king of a village whose people quarreled endlessly. They mocked his wish to lead them. But Paulito carried sand from the beach one handful at a time and built a sand fortress around the village. Ships arrived and the self-absorbed villagers would have been conquered, but the fortress kept them safe, and they appointed Paulito king. The legend shows the difference we can make if we work long and hard and don't give up. Impossible dreams can come true, and fate may select you when you least expect it. As Virgil's teacher, Ms. Murray, once told him, \"Sometimes life calls on you even when you don't raise your hand\". Will Virgil be prepared when life chooses him for a role in the drama with Valencia, Kaori, Gen, and Chet? Will you be ready in your own life when fate picks you?Hello, Universe is a nice story, though it doesn't strike me as Newbery material. I never got a strong sense why Virgil felt compelled to be Valencia's friend, but he did, and that's good enough for me. I empathize with Valencia for the unfair discrimination she faced. Being told a while back by her group of friends at the time that they didn't want to play with her anymore because her deafness was too much trouble to deal with...it stirs the reader's emotions. Isn't a friend worth a lot of trouble? I wouldn't have given this book a Newbery, but I appreciate its open heart, and I see why some readers love it. Congratulations on the Newbery Medal, Erin Entrada Kelly. I look forward to reading more of your work."}, {"userName": "Barb Middleton", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton", "userReview": "The is a well-crafted novel with interesting characters and structure. The story is about 11-year-old Vigil Salinas, an introvert who is painfully shy and trying to find his voice by talking to the confident and deaf, Valencia Somerset. He gets help from his close friend, Kaori Tanaka, a Japanese American and her side-kick sister, Gen. Kaori is an entrepreneur that believes her psychic abilities can help others with their problems. Gen is always asking a gazillion questions adding humor to the plot as the annoying and energetic younger sibling. Vigil struggles with standing up for himself against his family and the neighborhood bully, Chet Bullens. His parents tease him and call him \"Turtle\" waiting for him to come out of his shell. He's the introvert in an extroverted family. His Philippine grandmother, Lola, gets him and respects his quietness and hilariously tells him folk tales where children are eaten by monsters.The author captures the pain of teasing that families so often use when they don't like something about another person that is essential to their character. The parents are not intentionally cruel but don't understand the pain of their name-calling. Chet bullies Vigil but his character is developed to show how Chet's father is a poor role model that leads to Chet being insecure and bullying those around him as a result. His actions are not one-dimensional and more nuanced making for good discussions. The short chapters help keep the pacing moving along and the structure is brilliant. Valencia Somerset is deaf and her voice is portrayed in first-person, while all the other characters are in third-person. This limited point-of-view not only gives a personal touch that allows the readers to identify closely with Valencia but mimics the isolation a deaf person might feel. Many times, Valencia doesn't understand the person that is speaking because they are not facing her or are looking down. She comments on how often this happens in addition to trying to play games like hide-and-seek with friends but can't hear when they call out, \"Ready, set, go!\" Her friends appear to like her until the day they tell her she's wrecking the game and rather than figuring out one she can play, they shun her. She ends up having a continual nightmare as a result, where she is isolated in a field staring at an eclipse with a girl in a blue dress with no whites of her eyes showing - her eyes a black iris like the eclipse. This nightmare can symbolize darkness obscuring light or when prejudices blot out the goodness or light in people who are ruled by fear of people that are different from a disability or anyone oppressed or marginalized. This point of view lets the reader step into Valencia's character more closely and understand some of the challenges as well as advantages with her disability whether lip-reading or observing nature without sound. The two children that have disabilities, Virgil and Valencia, are in the same resource room at school and love the book, Gulliver's Travels by Jonathon Swift. They even name their guinea pigs Lilliput and Gulliver. The Lilliputians are afraid of Gulliver's size and welcome him at first before turning against him out of fear. Valencia is accepted by her friend, Roberta, but influenced by those around her later turning against her deafness in fear and ignorance paralleling the Lilliputians. Gulliver's Travels is a satire on politics and the author cleverly parallels the politics of middle school and belonging through subtle references. Gulliver is also an average person who is gifted with learning different languages. This is ironic considering Vigil cannot squeak out even a \"hello\" to Valencia because he is so shy. And the choice of the name Virgil is symbolic too. Virgil was Dante's guide through hell in Dante's Inferno. Virgil goes through hell; that is falling into a well where he has to find his voice to talk to Valencia and learn to stand up for himself against a bully. While some might find this slow-paced, I thought the short chapters helped move it along and the gorgeous writing and humor kept me engaged. When I went back to think about sections I started to see quite a bit of symbolism that I mention briefly. There's a lot going on in this book. It isn't going to be for everyone but it is a gem."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1222379-barbara", "userReview": "It can be challenging to predict which book will rise to the top as a Newbery contender, and this one clearly charmed members of the book award committee, perhaps because of the way it explores fate, coincidences, and the way some things are just meant to be. I enjoyed how each chapter gave me a glimpse into the heads of the different characters, all of whom seemed to be misfits in their own way. The lives of four, make that five if we count one of the character's little sister Gen, different youngsters somehow intersect in the most unlikely way when class bully Chet Bullens ups the stakes and thoughtlessly plays a prank on Virgil Salinas, the frequent object of his derision. Quiet, insecure Virgil has gone for a walk in the woods with his beloved guinea pig, Gulliver, when Chet accosts him and throws his backpack in an abandoned well. The backpack contains Gulliver, and there is no way that Virgil can leave him behind. Kaori Tanaka is expecting Virgil's visit since he often checks in with her about his fortune, but when he doesn't arrive on time, she is sure something is wrong. Valencia Somerset is smart and confident and never lets anyone give her a hard time about the fact that she has hearing issues. She happens to see Kaori's business card and contacts her. From there, it is, um, fate that all these different individuals will somehow end up in the woods on the same day. I couldn't help but worry that poor Virgil would not be found in that well since he had no way to get back up once he'd climbed down to rescued his pet, and then the top of the well was closed. But thankfully, the book didn't go in that direction, and these separate characters somehow bond. Even the fact that Gen just happens to have her jump rope with her when the rescue is made makes readers do a double take, and somehow the author even manages to summon some sympathy for Chet as he worries about living up to his father's athletic expectations for him. This book is delightful in many ways, an ideal middle grade novel, complete with some Philippine folktales told by Virgil's beloved grandmother, Lola. Readers won't be able to miss the strong message of self-empowerment and being true to one's self. I can see why this one garnered so much acclaim. Perhaps all of us can learn something if we listen to what the universe has to say and take a chance or two."}, {"userName": "Zaz", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15972406-zaz", "userReview": "A nice adventure, well paced and compelling, with great characters and a good diversity.The summer holidays are here but Virgil feels as if he was looking life from a hole.

Each of them had this/her very own unique voice: Kaori and Gen were funny, Valencia was smart and Virgil was very shy (I could also mention mister bully, but I didn\u2019t like him and it was a bit disturbing to read his point of view). They all added something to the story, with various cultures, realistic family dynamics, but also diversity with a Filipino-American boy, 2 Japanese-American girls and a Deaf girl. There were also some pets involved in the adventure, which was nice. I found the story compelling, with danger but also events that fitted well and where funny to discover because the characters didn\u2019t know about them. Bookish events involving 11 years old usually seem a lot unrealistic but the book did well in the matter with normal growing friendships, difficulties at school, unnerving parents and simple adventures taking place in the neighborhood. The fears and the rescue were realistic and the ending was totally satisfying for me.

I like that this book had a diverse cast of characters. Virgil, Valencia, and Kaori are all strong characters. In creating Valencia\u2019s character, Kelly purposely chose to make her strong and smart; breaking down the stereotype of the hearing impaired as meek and mild. Often the bully characters in children\u2019s books are one dimensional, so I appreciated that Kelly chose to tell Chet\u2019s story. Knowing his story did not make me like him, but it at least helped me understand him. I also thought it was really creative the way Kelly used sandwich making to show us the personalities of Valencia, Kaori, and Gen. This was very subtle in the book, but I feel like it helped me understand Kaori\u2019s need for order in the world. The relationship building in this book was very good. One of the best relationships was that of Virgil and his Lola (grandmother). Lola is the go between person for Virgil and a family that does not really understand him. His Lola is also one of the few people he feels comfortable talking to. I loved that she told him stories, which is something my grandmother used to do. I also loved the relationship between the sisters, Kaori and Gen. This line in the story describes their relationship perfectly, \u201cKaori didn\u2019t like to admit it, but she liked having Gen as her second-in-command, which meat she was always first-in-command\u201d (pg. 236). The plot in this story was simple, and although I liked the plot, I felt like something was missing. This story seemed very surface level and I felt like I was missing the story behind the story. The foreshadowing was somewhat blatant, which actually might be helpful for readers who would possibly be worried about Virgil being trapped in the well. I did like that the conflict was not fully resolved in this story, however. It made it seem more realistic. The idea that things are not always as bad as you think, seemed to be the overall theme. I liked this theme, but I felt like it could have been more fully developed."}, {"userName": "Georgia Ball", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19021982-georgia-ball", "userReview": "It took at least eight chapters for the action to start in this book.

Virgil, a gerbil-owning brother with a learning disability and a crippling fear of approaching the one girl in his school that he thinks is cool. Kaori, the young entrepreneur making it for herself as a kid psychic and helping others with her sidekick sister. Chet, a bully who gets it from his father and is all kinds of mean. And Valencia, the girl with the hearing aids in Virgil's resource room class who has one too many coincidental occurrences NOT to be completely made for Virgil knowing that their initials are the same, they go to the same school, named their gerbils after Gulliver's Travels, have quirky families and big hearts who want to be loved. The magical realism works well though I was skeptical at first but it's just the kind of story that warms on a cold winter day and keeps hope alive. And everyone should have a Lola in their lives."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50448-becky", "userReview": "First sentence: Eleven-year old Virgil Salinas already regretted the rest of middle school, and he'd only just finished sixth grade.Premise/plot: Virgil Salinas has a problem. He has a big crush on Valencia Somerset, but he's gone the whole school year without even saying hello. For some reason, this shyness is not a crushing failure until the first day of summer school. He seeks the guidance of a child psychic--a fortune teller--Kaori Tanaka. Kaori only takes children for clients, and she's aided by her younger sister, Gen. Virgil is one of her clients, but she's got another client as well, a new one. Valencia Somerset has been having nightmares. Will Kaori be able to interpret her dreams and solve her problem? One thing her two clients have in common is that they are both being picked on by Chet Bullens. What happens in the woods one Saturday morning may change all of their lives forever.My thoughts: Hello, Universe won the Newbery Medal for 2018. If it hadn't won the Newbery would I have been as disappointed with Hello, Universe? Maybe, maybe not. One thing is for certain, I did not like this book. (My expectations would have been lower, and thus my disappointment not so big if it hadn't won the Newbery.)The book has alternating narrators. My favorite narrator was probably Valencia Somerset. In fact, if the book was told solely through her perspective and if she never met Kaori Tanaka, I might have enjoyed the book. I did not care for the other narrators for the most part, though I liked Virgil just fine until the incident in the woods. (Virgil's grandmother was a character I liked.)What didn't I like about the book? Well. I didn't like Kaori Tanaka's fortune-telling. I didn't like her reading the stars, playing with crystals, and being an amateur astrologist. I also didn't like Virgil's time in the well. I didn't like how the spirits talked to him, and how he talked to the spirits. I found all of that weird and out of place. I also am not sure why Virgil often took his guinea pig, Gulliver, with him in his back pack. Other than the fact that this was a necessary part of the plot to bring all the characters together. The plot just didn't work for me."}, {"userName": "Leonard Kim", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17757241-leonard-kim", "userReview": "Hmm. This is the second rating in a row I've been asked to justify in comments. I don't feel like I have much to say about this one. I liked how most of the ending was handled-especially that Virgil wasn't immediately transformed by his experience. And I enjoyed the somewhat inexplicable appearance of Ruby in the well. I didn't dislike this book, but I guess the characters and their voices and dimensions didn't ring as true to me as they seem to have for others.I didn't think of this while reading, but Lynn Rae Perkins' Newbery-winning Criss Cross might be an interesting comparison. It's been a while, but I remember it too dealing with coincidence of a cosmic flavor bringing lives together. I feel that was probably a deeper and richer handling of similar themes. I especially appreciated how, in Criss Cross, even with the universe's conniving, human frailty still led to missed chances. I mentioned above how I appreciated how Virgil wasn't immediately transformed by his experience, but then I do think the ending after that may have been too tidy."}, {"userName": "Jordan Henrichs", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427342-jordan-henrichs", "userReview": "Loved the multiple characters and story lines and how they converged.

I love the cover and the artwork at the beginning of each chapter. This is the sort of book I would have been drawn to as a child, simply because of the nature artwork shown. 2. I like how this book was actually a pretty clean read as far as language. I think the words stupid, retard and retardo were the only harsh words used. 3. My favorite character was Valencia. She was deaf and had a strong personality that I admired. I also loved how she kept a nature journal and wrote about squirrels because she also admired Jane Goodall. 4. There were several quotes that I liked. For example: \" Crying is good for the soul,\" said Ruby softly. \" It means something needs to be released. And if you don't release the something, it just weighs you down until you can hardly move.\" What I didn't like about this book:Oh, boy. How to say this....well, I feel like the book was drenched in religious philosophy and insinuations that I simply don't agree with. Characters in this book spoke to spirits, held ceremonies to speak to spirits, prayed to a deceased missionary instead of God, consulted crystals for wisdom, proclaimed to have powers of the second sight, interpreted dreams, read the stars, relied on astrology for information, set their phone's ring tone to sound like the bells of a Buddhist monastery, and called themselves psychics. I get the feeling the author was trying to show diversity in each child but this was a big turn off for me. I also didn't like how the children made their parents out to be idiots. One character referred to her own mom as Mrs. Tanok instead of mom or mother. The general tone toward parents, from all the characters, felt overall negative. I felt like this book had a lot of potential but it fell flat for me both in plot and the forced religious diversity."}, {"userName": "Liesl Shurtliff", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/850376-liesl-shurtliff", "userReview": "I don't always love the Newbery winners.

His parents are both busy nurses, but his grandmother seems to understand him, and comforts him with stories. He has a crush on a girl in his class, Valencia, but doesn't know how to talk to her, so he consults Kaori, a girl who gives \"psychic advice\". Virgil also has to put up with local bully, Chet. When Chet throws Virgil's backpack down an abandoned well, he panics because his hamster, Gulliver, is in the pack, and jumps down into the well to retrieve him, and then is stuck. Valencia, whose deafness causes her some issues when dealing with others, is out in the woods observing squirrels on her way to get advice from Kaori, and vaguely notices the shift, but thinks little of it. When she arrives at Kaori's, Kaori is waiting for Virgil and voices her concern over his disappearance. The girls decide to investigate, and wisely start by asking his grandmother. Eventually, they come across Chet in the woods: he has been torturing snakes and has been bitten by one. All of the events come together, and Virgil is rescued from the well, tentative friendships are formed, and the adventure is neatly wrapped up. It's difficult to write understandable and distinct characters in alternating chapters, but Kelly does a good job of this, even though some chapters are in first person and others are in third. Virgil's fear of everything is palpable but not overdone, Valencia's eccentricities and interest in animals are quirky but endearing, and even Kaori's business interest in psychic readings (and her attempt to advertising them on a message board in town without getting in trouble with her parents) is portrayed realistically. Adults, rather than being absent, are hovering at the edges so that there can be adventure but also help if situations get out of hand. Virgil's grandmother plays an interesting role, sharing Filipino legends with him in order to make him stronger. One of these, about Ruby San Salvador, helps him when he is stuck in the well, since he has lengthy conversations with the spirit while waiting for help to arrive.Readers who enjoy books with diverse casts but a general feeling of sadness such as Rivers' The Girl in the Well is Me, Appelt's Maybe a Fox or Spinelli's Eggs will find Hello' Universe to be a complicated blend of social issues framed in a classic neighborhood adventure story. Don't think I will buy this one-- Chet was too stereotypical, and I couldn't believe that any 6th grader would be stupid enough to jump down a well. Okay, VIRGIL, didn't seem stupid enough to jump down a well. I'm sure this will get lots of love, but I don't see it circulating well in my library."}], "description": "Winner of the 2018 Newbery Medal In one day, four lives weave together in unexpected ways.

Kaori Tanaka is a self-proclaimed psychic, whose little sister Gen is always following her around.
