After finishing this one, I started and rejected EIGHT novels in a row!Anyway, this is a clever little labyrinthine biography of Paul Christopher. It wasn't the first Christopher novel, but it's a really good one for getting to know all the characters that show up in the other books in the series. You get to find out the history of how all the people ended up in Paul's life, and why they act the way they do. The book covers about fifty years of time. It starts with how his parents met in 1923, and ends in the mid-1970s. I liked getting to find out all the family history, and then Paul Christopher's wild and rocky career with \"the Outfit\" (CIA). Pay attention to the seemingly minor characters and events as they appear. You will need to remember them in the last hundred pages or so of the book when the author unravels the web and all the secrets are revealed."}, {"userName": "Dave", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/757896-dave", "userReview": "4+ The narrator of the audio book did a very nice job imo."}, {"userName": "Tripp", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/867938-tripp", "userReview": "For many years, the superior spy novels of Charles McCarry were only found in used bookshops. Thanks to republication by Overlook Press, it is now possible to easily get copies of McCarry's Paul Christopher novels. I've just finished the Last Supper, which is probably the best of the four Cold War Christopher novels.What I find most remarkable about these four novels is that they remain consistently excellent while being dramatically different in execution. The first, Miernik Dossier, is the most experimental. It using a documentation review as the framing device, and the reader is meant to be a government official examining various reports from a spy operation.The Tears of Autumn is a conspiracy thriller with Christopher developing a novel theory about the Kennedy assassination. Be sure to read this before you read Last Supper as it is partially a sequel to that book. This one is a bit bleak.The Secret Lovers precedes Tears of Autumn chronologically and is the most conventional spy novel of the bunch. It will be one of the finest spy novels you read, but it is at heart a basic story of betrayal and identity.With the Last Supper, McCarry goes epic. The time scale is much longer, starting just after WW1 and ending in the early 80s. It spans two (maybe three) generations of the Christopher family and their strong wills and great misfortune. There are many more characters and non-obvious interactions. I think James Ellroy read this one, as I can see how the murky moralities and actions of the main characters influenced the LA Quartet.While these books are different, together they paint a fascinating view of the world of espionage as a machine that churns up its participants, but they keep coming back for more. The overall tone is realist as to what can be achieved although an element of despair creeps into the final book. These are consistently good books and I will continue reading them."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1361000-tony", "userReview": "McCarry, Charles. THE LAST SUPPER. (1983). *****. McCarry is probably the most under-valued writer of our times. He is a master craftsman of the espionage novel. All of them focus on the human side of spydom, although there are lots of well-researched scenes set in exotic locales. This novel focuses on the life of his major character, Paul Christopher, from his introduction into the secret world of \u201cThe Outfit\u201d during post World War II, through the Cold War and into current times. This is really Christopher\u2019s life and the life of his father and mother, both of whom were directly responsible for his subsequent entry into the world of spydom. It is a novel where no one is what he (or she) seems to be. Who can you trust? It starts in the jungles of Burma where initial hatreds are formed between two of the principal protagonists while fighting the Japanese. Later, it follows the plight of Christopher\u2019s parents as they try to flee Germany with him. His mother is stopped at the border and is never seen again. This becomes a life-long quest for his father \u2013 to find out what happened to his wife. Later, we learn of the various exploits of Christopher and his subsequent capture by the Chinese and imprisonment for just under eleven years. During that time, he has a lot to think about, and seems to see through the various ruses that his comrades and superiors have indulged in while he had been in active service. In all, this is a terrific read. McCarry seems to have been the favorite of most of his contemporary writers in the genre, including Eric Ambler, Richard Condon, and William Stevenson (\u201cA Man Called Intrepid\u201d). I couldn\u2019t understand why he never made it to the top of the popularity list like they did. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Ian Robb", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12828680-ian-robb", "userReview": "A good book in the author\u2019s Paul Christopher series. Traces Paul\u2019s family from before he was born, through the loss of his mother, death of his father. All the time there are conspiracies and there seems to be a mole most of the way through. Wolkowicz, who is always there for Paul and everyone in American security, it seems, is it. I really enjoyed this book. It has a depth of plot and is a good, SLOW, read. I should read it again. I read this in Victoria I read it again May 2007 and it is a great book. This book puts flesh on Paul\u2019s life. He and other characters appear in many of the novels. In several of McCarry\u2019s books there appear characters who are rich and have been educated at Yale, Boolah Boolah. He mentions the Skull and bones secret society in this book to which Waddy belongs (as does George W bush). The main reason for Wolkowicz being a traitor is how he and other poor boys are treated by Yale grads like Waddy."}, {"userName": "John Treanor", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4253809-john-treanor", "userReview": "\"Read\" this one as an audio book via audible.com. That certainly colored my reaction to the book. Not sure that I'll do that again except on long drives or flights. The scope of the book was pretty epic, covering Germany in the late 30's, the war in Burma, post-war Berlin and modern-day France and Washington. You're probably better off reading the Tears of Autumn first, as that is helpful understanding some of the references. The subject is Paul Cristopher, a member of \"The Outfit\" or CIA. It covers his family history and their own recruitment into the CIA, his mom's kidnapping by the Gestapo and whole sections of the book are devoted to the other main characters.

This long flash back takes a good half of the book; then, when we are back at the starting point, McCarry sends us back to a previous novel (Tears Of Autumn) and story at that point becomes highly interconnected with the events of that book, which luckily I had read not too long ago.Having said that, if you manage to humour the author through the first half, the second part will wonderfully reward your patience; all the loose ends will come together in a magnificent crescendo of emotions."}, {"userName": "Sandi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1185451-sandi", "userReview": "A good old fashioned page turner that was both a suspenseful spy story and family saga that spanned the globe and the decades from the late twenties to the seventies.

The novel chronicles the Christopher family through several decades, from the earliest Gestapo shadows in Austria to the tattered jungles of Burma during early OSS/CIA ops, to the summer stench of Saigon during the Vietnam War, to the bombed-out sewers of Berlin blanketed in heirloom Persian rugs and decoder machines during counterintelligence ops against the Russians during the Cold War. But, though the novel is ostensibly about the Christophers, it's really about someone and something else. It's about the other spy in the room - the guy with the false teeth who didn't go to Yale; it's about the invisible class warfare in America, it's about the shadowed lie of democracy, the careful artifice of diplomacy. It's about the mottled chain of command, and the circular logic of integrity.

He's captivating as a writer, creating a sense of awe and fascination with his main character. He works subtly with the idea of the spy as hero, it's not too obvious and somehow compelling and to this degree he is a successful writer. He does not however reach the heights of Le Carre's realism. He's still entrenched in a somewhat mythical worldview. His hero is larger than life, although he fascinates, he ultimately is not real.

Dismissing his lover Molly Benson's feelings of dread, Paul leaves her bed to fly off to 1960s Vietnam. Sure enough, Molly is quickly murdered. Abruptly, the book flashes back to 1926 Germany where Paul's father, a young American writer, encounters minor Prussian nobility and the woman who will become Paul's mother. Apolitical until the Nazis arrest his wife in 1939, Paul's father joins the OSS that becomes the postwar CIA. At this point, fans of this veteran author will settle back to enjoy nearly 400 pages of nasty scheming. Paul's father spies successfully, but his obsessive efforts to track down his wife lead to Paul's father's murder. Following his father's footsteps into the Cold War \"outfit,\" Paul travels the world to counter communist skullduggery, while delivering plenty of his own. He retires (after a 10-year stint in a Chinese prison) but continues to investigate his father's death. In so doing, he finds the answer as well as the reason for Molly's murder, leading to a shocking twist that turns his world upside down.", "title": "The Last Supper\n      \n          (Paul Christopher #5)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/574791.The_Last_Supper", "average": 4.12, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348715269l/574791.jpg", "reviews": 62, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/64540.Charles_McCarry", "name": "Charles McCarry"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Spy Thriller", "Thriller", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/574791.The_Last_Supper", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2488259.The_Last_Supper", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5672433-the-last-supper", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12658707-the-last-supper", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2817671-the-last-supper", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/651044.The_Miernik_Dossier", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/871695.The_Tears_of_Autumn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16129294-the-shanghai-factor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1062193.Old_Boys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/577030.Christopher_s_Ghosts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
