It sure didn\u2019t start like that. Maggie is full of snark, so she isn\u2019t the type to wallow in her misery. She\u2019s blind and it sucks, but what can she do about it?Looks like she didn\u2019t need to find answer to her question, because the answer found HER.And he goes by the name of Ben. Before you start rolling your eyes, know this: Ben is ten years old. He is NOT the love-interest. He is a friend. And the only person whom Maggie can see.AND, he stole my heart. He is A-D-O-R-A-B-L-E. Poor kiddo, but good for him that his disability doesn\u2019t keep him from doing what he loves.So there\u2019s a lot of happy and disbelieving at first, then comes the real drama. It takes some time for it to reach Maggie (was probably stuck in traffic), but when it does, it\u2019ll be hard for you to will your eyes to stay dry.There\u2019s a case of love-hate relationship in this\u2014Maggie\u2019s love-interest thinks she isn\u2019t really blind, that she\u2019s faking it, which is absurd but logic all things considered and, ultimately, kind of fun. This was one of the first books that I read with a blind heroine, and I must say I didn\u2019t feel as if it lacked anything\u2014descriptions, characterization or dept. Not at all.BUT, I\u2019m going to warn you, it\u2019s not realistic. It feels real\u2014so not contrived\u2014but there\u2019s definitely some magical realism involved. It\u2019s good though, so good. You can\u2019t see me, but I\u2019m giving the author a hand of applause.

The One Thing, however, is not only undeniably good but brilliant. Upon finishing in one sitting, The One Thing turned instantly into one of the best YA contemporary books I\u2019ve read this year.I was lucky to receive an early draft from the author and while I was more than excited to read, I didn\u2019t particularly know what to expect. I didn\u2019t expect to be so hooked from the very first chapter that I couldn\u2019t put down the book for the life of me until I turned to the last page. I didn\u2019t expect to laugh so hard at the main character\u2019s sarcasm and fun banter. I didn\u2019t expect to fall completely in love not only with the love interest, but with his completely adorable kid brother too. Most of all, I didn\u2019t expect the strong emotional punches that Marci Lyn Curtis packed with her story.What I did expect was to read about a girl who was struggling to come to terms with becoming blind. Maggie used to be a soccer star before she lost her sight. Her professional soccer dreams suddenly upturned, alongside with basically her whole life, she\u2019s taken aback when she meets ten year old Ben Milton, and she suddenly can see. Ben\u2019s spina bifida doesn\u2019t stop him from being adorably quick-witted and mature for his age and as Maggie becomes fast friends with the young boy, she learns that while she may have lost her sight, she hasn\u2019t lost her heart.Nothing beats having a heroine you want to root for. Maggie is probably one of my favourite narrators ever. I only wish I had her sass. I loved her voice and narrative SO much. Not only was she utterly hilarious, she was also so honest and authentic. I just couldn\u2019t help but love her strong personality. Moreover, I loved her growth in the book, especially as she grappled with her strained relationships with her mom and best friend and embracing her life as it is now.As for Ben, no words can describe my love for this kid. I once wrote a list of List Of Awesome Quirky Contemporary Kids and while it needs to be updated, Ben totally tops the list, with his infinite charm and funny wisecracks. I\u2019ve never read a more vibrantly happy character as him. Still, like Maggie, he was very realistically portrayed. All of the characters were, actually. Ben\u2019s brother, Mason, who is Maggie\u2019s love interest was also awesome and I loveeeee the slow-burn romance between them.Finally, the writing in this book is also something to behold. The fabulous musical aspect incorporated in the story made Marci\u2019s prose even more lyrical and resounding. Not only do her words give you all the feels, they also inspire you to think and ponder the things (the people most especially) that we value and love and the circumstances that reveal us.Now can we change The One Thing\u2019s title to The Best Thing yet? I\u2019m mostly kidding- I really wouldn\u2019t change a thing about this amazing book. I swear, it is an excellent read. If you\u2019re looking for your next favourite book, Marci Lyn Curtis\u2019 witty, passionate, heart-soaring debut novel is it."}, {"userName": "Marci Curtis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23228513-marci-curtis", "userReview": "I thought this book was pretty darn good, all 199,376 times that I read it.But then, I might be a smidge biased."}, {"userName": "Kels", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28386116-kels", "userReview": "That's the one thing about being blind: you see people as they really are.\nSix months ago, Maggie became sick with meningitis that caused her sudden blindness, but when that happened she lost more than her eye sight. She lost her dreams of going big with soccer and getting college scholarships, she lost her friends and even her relationships with her parents, which became distant and awkward. Yet things change when an ungraceful fall lands her with a bruised head, and something she never thought was possible for her again: her sight. Well, more specifically, she sees a little boy, Ben, and quickly learns that her vision only extends to him. So, I'm just going to say it outright: this book disappointed me. I thought the concept was interesting and new, but it suffered greatly by way of execution. I had a love/hate relationship with the writing (but mostly hate). On the one hand, I thought Marci Curtis wrote with a lot of wit and sarcastic humor (which I love), and her sentences were all so creatively crafted and metaphoric (another plus in my book), but my main issue with the writing was that it did a lot more showing that it did telling. Seriously, the narration drones on and on, and is practically 90% monologues (maybe I'm exaggerating, I'm not sure), and what little dialogues that are speckled throughout the text are often longwinded and tedious, rather than having a natural flow of exchanges, you know, like normal conversations often have. There's also a lot of redundancy in the text. I prefer tight writing and I found some of the sentences to make little sense:He moseyed toward his destinations at about half the speed of smell. (What does this even mean???)I couldn't get any words to transit to my mouth. They slid around in my brain, unable to find an exit. (this is just an awkward sentence)In my experience, they [healthy foods] tasted like either dirt or air--like something nasty or like nothing at all. (Again... what?)Dad was the most ho-hum guy on the planet. (Is ho-hum even a word? *looks up in dictionary* okay you got me there, Marci. But seriously.)Ben was the grand pooh-bah... (Now you're just making up words! Pooh-bah?! What does that even mean?! *finds out it's a real word* OH COME ON!) But there was more...For a woman who struggled to pronounce \"twelve o'clock,\" Hilda sure knew how to materialize on my doorstep at exactly twelve o'clock.  (Yes, because we all know that people with a foreign accent obviously can't read time)Her no had two syllables, the first one for the no and the second one for the rest of the story. (I'm no longer sure how to pronounce the word no)Brothy things were not my cup of tea. Mostly because I didn't like my tea served with wilty vegetables floating around it. (I'm pretty sure tea and soup are not equivalents)The rough waters of the Estrogen Ocean were not easily navigable. (You have got to be kidding me)Another huge problem I had was with the overall characterizations. None of the characters were strongly developed (including the MC), and some not at all. It was unfortunate that her parents were so poorly developed (they just had stand-in roles in this novel) because I wanted to better understand what they were going through and why Maggie's disability caused their relationship with her to suffer so much, especially with the mother. And Ben was so freaking adorable, but not once did I picture him as a kid. What ten year old kid do you know talks like this:I am not flirting, per se. I cannot help that I am a sexy piece of man-flesh.Woman, your words wound me greatly.The thing is, Thera? I just had one of those aha moments. The ones Oprah is always talking about? (Is Ben supposed to be a ten year old, or a middle aged woman?) And I completely was not buying the attraction/insta-love between Mason and Maggie. The way Maggie was so on and off about him, made me want to slap some sense into her. One minute she's furious at him for giving her the cold shoulder, next second she's daydreaming about the way his voice sounds pronouncing syllables. It was annoying, and it made Maggie into a twit. But despite Maggie flaws, I still think she was a likable character, I just wish she would have been a smarter one. Overall, The One Thing had an interesting premise, and a lot of unmet potential, but it just didn't meet my expectations. There's nothing really going on in the pages, the ending is pretty predictable, Ben, Mason, and Maggie's relationship is obvious plot convenience that doesn't feel the least bit organic, and what started off for me as intriguing quickly faded into boredom."}, {"userName": "Angigames", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27639962-angigames", "userReview": "Esordio davvero meraviglioso questo della Curtis! Si tratta di una storia, un libro, un mondo speciale.L\u2019autrice mette il cuore nelle pagine e si vede, in pi\u00f9, pu\u00f2 contare su una scrittura fluida semplice e diretta, eppure magica.

Lo ammetto, anche se con me non vale, Curtis, perch\u00e9 sono di lacrima facile!Una storia che pu\u00f2 risultare gi\u00e0 sentita, ma che invece, \u00e8 tutto tranne come una se l\u2019aspetta.Maggie ha 17 anni, una passione sfrenata per il pallone e, a causa di una grave forma di meningite, ha perso la vista da 7 mesi. L\u2019allegra ragazzina di un tempo ha lasciato il posto ad una persona cinica, disincantata, svogliata, che non si aspetta pi\u00f9 nulla, chiusa, che non si fida di nessuno. Ma l\u2019incontro con Ben, dolcissimo bambino di 10 anni, affetto da spina bifida e un concentrato esplosivo di entusiasmo, gioia e intelligenza, incider\u00e0 (per forze molto maggiori) sulla nuova vita di Maggie. \u201cCos\u2019\u00e8 che ti rende speciale?\u201d \u00e8 questa la domanda che Ben, con una tranquillit\u00e0 impressionante, rivolge a Maggie, una domanda semplice eppure potentissima, che ha smosso qualcosa sia nel mio cuore che in quello della protagonista. Segnatevela, rileggetela, capitela fino in fondo e, una volta fatto, non potrete pi\u00f9 fare a meno del piccolo Ben, che sia per Maggie che per il lettore sar\u00e0 un punto di svolta, di partenza, un salto verso qualcosa di diverso e nuovo, una nuova esistenza pi\u00f9 consapevole e pi\u00f9 profonda di quella passata. Ho adorato ogni singolo componente di questa storia, ed ho amato ancora di pi\u00f9 come la Curtis ha gestito la parte romance, che \u00e8 presente e molto dolce, che non \u00e8 istantanea ma assolutamente perfetta per un libro del genere, che non stona, ed invece crea un\u2019armonia spontanea e quindi magnifica.

My. Gosh. I have no words to express just how much I loved this book. It\u2019s one of the best books that I have read this year and let me tell you, I\u2019ve read a lot of amazing books in 2015. But this one flew right there near the top. It\u2019s absolutely fantastic, cute, beautiful, so intense at times, heartbreaking at others (yes, I cried, shut up). I just want to shove this in everyone\u2019s hands and make them read it, because it is fabulous. From Goodreads:Maggie Sanders might be blind, but she won't invite anyone to her pity party. Ever since losing her sight six months ago, Maggie's rebellious streak has taken on a life of its own, culminating with an elaborate school prank. Maggie called it genius. The judge called it illegal.Now Maggie has a probation officer. But she isn't interested in rehabilitation, not when she's still mourning the loss of her professional-soccer dreams, and furious at her so-called friends, who lost interest in her as soon as she could no longer lead the team to victory.Then Maggie's whole world is turned upside down. Somehow, incredibly, she can see again. But only one person: Ben, a precocious ten-year-old unlike anyone she's ever met.Ben's life isn't easy, but he doesn't see limits, only possibilities. After awhile, Maggie starts to realize that losing her sight doesn't have to mean losing everything she dreamed of. Even if what she's currently dreaming of is Mason Milton, the infuriatingly attractive lead singer of Maggie's new favorite band, who just happens to be Ben's brother.But when she learns the real reason she can see Ben, Maggie must find the courage to face a once-unimaginable future... before she loses everything she has grown to love. I cannot fully emphasize how much I adored this book. It had me laughing out loud withing the first couple of pages. And that\u2019s no easy feat, as I tend to not be amused so easily by books. Maggie\u2019s character is fantastic: she\u2019s sarcastic, funny as hell, likable overall, despite her unlikable moments and very real - her voice was so refreshing to read. The author managed to convey in a simple, yet effective manner, all that Maggie has gone through and how that affected her. I wouldn\u2019t be able to imagine what it would be like to lose my sight from one day to the other, but I got a pretty good idea here - I could relate to Maggie and much of what I\u2019d do would mirror her actions. I ADORED Ben. Ben was the little brother I wish I\u2019d had. He\u2019s funny, mature for his age, smart and a smartass at the same time, incredibly kind and I felt for him SO. MUCH. My heart swells just thinking about him. All the characters were likable and very realistically portrayed. I loved the family angles in this book - it not only explored Maggie\u2019s illness and interactions with Ben, but also with her family and with Ben\u2019s. I loved that the romantic aspect didn\u2019t overtake the general theme of the book - of friendship, overcoming adversities and finding yourself again, finding that one thing that makes you you. It stayed more in the background and it\u2019s refreshing to see something like this - not every book has to have romance. I felt a lot that it was a coming of age novel, because you can see how much Maggie grows throughout the book. But she grows in a way that stays true to herself, if that makes any sense whatsoever. I cannot find any fault with this book. I read it in one sitting and hardly felt the time pass by. The writing is phenomenal, heartfelt, real, accessible, engaging. I need you all to read this book. It\u2019s original, and you will have a blast with it.

This book was really really good! It definitely surpassed all of my expectations. It was funny, sad, real, heart-wrenching, well-written, relatable, smart and fun to read. I think this book is going to be really popular because it's so good! As for Marci Lyn Curtis, I hope she writes more amazing novels like this one. This was an incredible debut novel! It kind of reminded me of something Sarah Dessen would write (one of the brilliant ones) so if you like her writing, you should definitely read this. The best thing about this book is the writing. Marci Lyn Curtis wrote some hilarious passages in this book, it was laugh out loud hilarious (and I don't really laugh out loud at a lot of books!). This book was one of the funniest books I have ever read. Maggie was so funny, I loved her character. Another great thing about the writing was how relatable it was. I'm not blind but I could relate to some of the things Maggie was going through. Maggie had a lot of really great insights into the world and her thoughts transcended from her life to my life. All of the characters were really well done. I absolutely adored Ben, he was a little sweetie. Mason was probably my least favourite character. I didn't really like him until about 80% into the book. There was no insta-love in this book though and so I did like the way Marci Lyn Curtis executed the romance. It felt very realistic. Another wonderful thing about the book was the relationship Maggie had with her parents. It felt so real and it broke my heart. I could really relate to a lot of Maggie's feelings about her family. This book had a wonderful pace, it was a lovely quick read. This book was a little clich\u00e9d but most books are these days.

Seriously, read this book.I was intrigued by the description of this novel, especially since I wasn't sure what it would be about. I didn't know what to expect, but it made me want to read it even more. I'm so glad I did! I absolutely loved Ben and Maggie's friendship. Ben is the most adorable kid ever and I just want him for myself (which sounds weird, but it's okay. You'll understand if you read this book). I loved how he reacted to Maggie's news about her seeing him even though she's blind and I adored the way he kept trying to kiss her and saying that she's his girlfriend, even though he's way too young for her. I thought he was simply incredible. I know Maggie feels bad because she thinks she's using him to see, but in my head, it has always been clear that from the beginning, Maggie loved this kid and wanted to spend time with him because of how happy he makes her. It touched me more than I would've expected and I cried more than once.I wasn't really expecting a love story in this novel, but I was happy to discover there is one. Although it's really not what I'll remember the most about this book, it's sweet and cute and I loved it. Also, I really enjoyed seeing Maggie angry and passionate, since she's an incredibly funny character. I wish I could be more like her, except without all the trouble she gets into. Maggie's story made me sad, because it must be incredibly hard to lose your sight so suddenly. I understand why she pushed her friends away, but I can't imagine being her friend and seeing her get through all of that while being excluded from her life. They must have been really sad, too. I was glad to see her embrace her handicap and become happy again, even trying to make other friends. It's a great character development. I can't think of anything that I disliked in this novel. It's something that I would recommend to anyone.

But poor book, it had the unfortunate luck to be read right after Illuminae. When you follow a mind-blowing book with a good book, well, it's hard not to compare, and this one doesn't hold up... to Illuminae or to other contemporaries I've loved this year. I just felt like something was missing, something that would make it memorable for me in the future. That's not to say that The One Thing doesn't have a lot going for it. Actually, I think contemporary YA fans are going to eat it up. It's extremely funny and heartfelt and has a rather humbling message. The main character, Maggie, lost her sight six months ago thanks to an unexpected illness. Her life has naturally turned upside down and inside out. She can't do the things she loves any more - like playing soccer - and she's lost her friendships. By some miracle, though, she meets a ten-year-old boy and she can see him (and even things around him). For the first time in a while she feels whole again. Except, her friendship with Ben - precocious, charming, adorable Ben - shows her so much more about life than she had been giving it credit for. Maybe losing her sight doesn't have to mean losing everything she's dreamed of.Maggie has to be one of the most hilarious characters I've ever met. This girl could teach a class in sarcasm. If you like to be in someone's head who can spin one-liners and sass like no one's business, you'll want to read The One Thing for Maggie alone. I wish I had thought to highlight some of my favorite quotes, but just trust when I say she will have you cracking up. The same can be said of Ben, who I thought was a little creepy at first but he is pretty much the most adorable thing ever. He's clever and curious, and he has the biggest heart, always putting others before himself. He's a special kid, that's for sure. Maggie and Ben play off each other perfectly, her dry humor to his enthusiastic pondering. I love how much positivity he brought into Maggie's life. But how could Maggie see Ben? Obviously I won't spoil that here, but it's one of the reasons I struggled with the book. I thought it stretched the limits of realistic fiction, making the overall message about \"blindness\" and \"seeing\" what's right in front of you a little too on the nose. It's a catalyst for Maggie reconquering the world and finally making steps in the right direction again, yet I thought these scenarios came off a tad too forced at times. I also wish Maggie's other relationships had been better developed. In particular her mom, who is distant and disinterested. She leaves a lot to be desired in the mother department, and yet she gets off way too easy for her lack of mom skills. I never understood why she treated her daughter the way she did; it's like she just stopped trying, but we never find out why because she never fully explains herself. I wanted more than just a fight and a make-up conversation between them at the end. Then there's Mason, Ben's older brother and Maggie's crush, who we don't get to know much about, especially in the first half. Maggie is endearingly smitten with him, which I found realistic and hilarious, but I don't think he spoke more than twenty words to her. He's wary of her friendship with Ben, a protective side that I thought was sweet, but I would have liked more personality from him. As such, their romance is sadly underdeveloped, despite having a couple of genuine scenes toward the end. While The One Thing is not a favorite of mine, I do think it will touch a lot of readers and put them in a nice happy place while reading. I was doing plenty of smiling myself, and, more importantly, I was rooting for Maggie to feel passionate about life again.

It's Marci's debut and I already know I'll read her next books as well!Halfway through the book I already knew this would become one of my favorite books ever and well, it's true. It's funny, sarcastic, serious and heartwarming ... it's emotional, unbelievably sad but at the same time cute also makes you so, so happy. Seriously, I love this book with all my heart and even hugged my kindle after I was finished, it's THAT good. I immeditaley fell in love with the characters - they seemed so real and down to earth that I couldn't help but connect and feel with them. Especially Ben found a quick way into my heart and I'm sure you'll love him as much as I do ... there's seriously no other way. This kid is EVERYTHING. Such an awesome friend, very funny, motivating and with this general positive way of looking at life ... you can only be happy around him!I also really liked Maggie as our main character. She's been through a lot and at first I felt sorry for her because it's hard to lose your sight, I imagine, but she's a great person and learned from her mistakes and everything life threw at her way. She's strong and doesn't need pity from other people. I just liked her a lot and admire her for her strength.And then there's Mason ... oh my dear god. Swoon-worthy and drop dead gorgeous Mason Milton. *sigh* He's Ben's brother and the lead singer of Maggie's favorite band and ABSOLUTELY awesome! Like with (almost) every character there's so much more about them than what we first see ... that's the same for Mason. He's kind and cares so much for the people he loves. He's passionate. And well, he sings. In a band. I mean, that alone is already awesome but damnit. I totally understand why people fell in love with him, I'd be no different!The storyline is amazing and I adored every little thing about it. It's a little mysterious and leaves you wondering about the why's and how's of everything and there was not even one moment of boredom. None. Marci's humor is great and I caught myself laughing out loud a few times but she's also incredibly talented when it comes to writing emotional and serious scenes. Yes, I cried. It wasn't pretty and my feelings were all over the place but it was totally worth it because her writing is brilliant and so, so easy to read! I liked that a lot!Overall, I just want to recommend this book to EVERYONE because I loved it so much! I don't even want to let go of these great characters and the awesome time I had with them. Honestly, I wouldn't mind to read a little more about them but I knooow it's a stand-alone so yeah. Let me just tell you, that it's definitely worth your time and a really, really good book that easily became one of my favorites and I have no doubt it could be the same for you!

I literally did not move once I started this book- hence my VERY full bladder at the moment.

He just jumps off of the pages and I fell in love with him with his first sentence: \"That was the most majestic fall I've ever seen.\" This book made me cry. Full on sob, actually. It made me smile. It made me laugh. It made me feel so many emotions, and I normally cannot say that for a book. The author has done something so unique with this story in that making it something contemporary, while also blending the reason behind Maggie's ability to see Ben, which is abnormal, to say the least. I also really loved that how, even though I called the plot twist pretty early on, I still kept thinking, \"What is going to happen next??\" Overall, it was a lovely, inspiring story that will rip out your heart, shove it back in, and then stitch you up with a smile.

There'll be 2 giveaways open to US residents and an INTL giveaway.We take a lot of things for granted, that's for sure. And if we lose a thing that means a lot to us, then we'd feel like nothing else matters anymore, that we're incomplete and we cannot function anymore. The One Thing serves as an eye-opener, that even in times of pain and obstacles, there is hope and you are not alone.Maggie, a 17 year old girl, who gets her eye sight taken away from her after getting bacterial meningitis. She thinks everything is over, her relationship with her family, her friendship and her soccer career. To Maggie, not being able to see feels like a burden. She rebels, gets herself in juvenile custody but later encounters a ten year old boy, Ben. To her surprise, she sees him. She actually sees him and she wonders why. Ben becomes the flicker of hope to Maggie's life and almost at once, her life turns into a spirally road, with her heart and faith challenged with every turn.What is this book? How did it come to exist? This is me in rabid fangirl mode right now. This book is one of the best reads I've had had in a while. Let me get into detail. Maggie is a character that you'd think you wouldn't like, but she's actually honest, no nonesense, sassy, witty, sensitive and kind. Her predicament makes her cold and distant towards others, but meeting Ben, we get to peel off layers in Maggie, and she becomes a revelation of sorts. Speaking of Ben, HALLELUJAH, praise the Lord for this kid. It's so refreshing to read this kid with his humor and wit. As though the light at the end of the tunnel to Maggie, Ben brings light and hope in this novel. And the best about Ben is his views on everything, as if each turn could turn positive. And he's 10! I can go on and on about this kid. He's sensitive and he cares about his family and friends. I think we all wish we could have a Ben or a kid with this much positivism in our lives. Even with his own predicaments, Ben doesn't fail to shine a bright smile and exude his charm. And please, I'm sure one day this kid is gonna win over a number of girlfriends. There, there Ben. She'll come one day.I love the Milton family. They've become a way for Maggie to see a sliver of hope in her situation. And they exude so much good vibes, it's great. Of course, with a bit of an exception with Mason, who is Ben's older brother. He's a lot more reserved. If I could describe Mason, I would compare him to Adam Wilde, Where She Went stage, a little rough of the edges, but still has his soft side in him. The romance in this book is subtle, not too \"slap in the face\", cheesy but in the right way, sweet without being overly sweet and definitely had the right way of build up. I enjoy books that build up romance and doesn't hide the fact that it is existent, rather than denying it. Though Mason is not my favorite in this book, he did bring something nice to the table. The other characters were also quite great! Clarissa, with her overly sweet self, is actually the person you'd want to cling to the most. Lauren made me remember that I had a ton of fake friends in elementary and in high school. Oh well. Maggie's parents are on their way to adjusting, thank the heavens. And Grandpa Keith rocks!A rollercoaster of feelings, the humor and drama are meshed together so well. I would be laughing at first and then I'd frown and then I'd be staring off to a distance, contemplating, \"what if I end up in the same situation as Maggie, what would I do?\" It wasn't afraid to show how big of an obstacle Maggie's blindness was but then it made it all the better when she was actually doing something about it. I related a lot with Maggie. Rather than her blindness, crippling her somehow, my sadness would at times take me into a place where I'd feel anxious about a lot of things, and I wouldn't like to mingle with other people anymore. But there are things, like Loose Cannons, that make everything better, or meeting people like Ben who help me. I think we all go through a time in our lives where we actually need to set ourselves free from reigns that hold us back and try new possibilities, no matter how scary they can be or may seem. And the scene with Ben. You don't make me laugh/cry like that. You don't. How dare you? I love you.My THING. What is my thing? The thing that makes me happy? Reading I would say, but I have a lot of THINGS I would say make me happy and are helping me through tough times. And I'm glad Ben pointed them out. I almost forgot what they really mean.Marci Lyn Curtis is a genius. Though it might seem kind of vague to believe that if you end up blind you'll see a person from some strange reason, it does give light to the issue that no matter the challenges ahead, and even if you have a disability, it shouldn't hinder you from doing the things you love and trying out new things as well. It was written as if I'm just talking with a friend, discovering new feelings and possibilities, telling me frustrations and I'm like, yeah yeah.The One Thing is a refreshing read that will give you hope and will instill in you to be more positive about the world and that there are people who love you no matter what happens to you.

She is struggling to come to terms with her blindness and to adapt to her new way of living. Maggie soon meets ten year old Ben who has spina bifida but is so full of life that she is quickly drawn to his infectious personality. But there is also the small matter of her being able to see him and a small area surrounding him. She doesn't know if she's somehow getting her sight back or if she's just going crazy but either way she loves spending time with Ben. She is also surprised to learn that his brother, Mason, is the lead singer of her favourite band.I really liked Maggie. She has a very sarcastic humour which I related to well. She has spent her life working towards her dream of being a professional soccer player, following in her mother's footsteps, and having to give up on that has left her feeling a bit lost. She's lost her friends and her college ambitions and doesn't quite know what to do with herself. I liked that she didn't let people get away with being asses and told them exactly what she thought of them. It was easy to respect her in those situations.Ben was undoubtedly the highlight of the book. He is so adorable! He doesn't let his disability get the better of him and is just so nice to everyone. He's a little bit quirky but has a good heart and tries to make everyone around him happy. Everyone should have a friend like Ben!Mason is a bit of a love/hate character for me. He was incredibly moody at the beginning and was so quick to judge Maggie without taking the time to listen or talk to her. I found it annoying that she was still so infatuated by him at those times when he was just being an idiot. I did love his protectiveness over Ben though. It was really sweet how he looked out for his brother.Despite the fact Mason is the love interest, the romance isn't an overbearing element of the story which I liked. It was slow and often in the background to allow other things to take precedence. I'm glad about that as it was much more interesting to see Maggie's friendships with Ben and Clarissa develop as well as see her begin to embrace her blindness.I didn't really get the point of Maggie being able to see Ben. I won't spoil the reasons for it but I did guess it very early on. We find out why she can see him but it's not really explained in great detail. I think the book would have worked perfectly without this element as Maggie and her relationships with the other characters were so great. I don't think she needed to have seen anybody at any point; I think she could just have easily made those relationships and come to terms with her blindness without the added element of her being able to see Ben.Overall, I did enjoy reading this book but a couple of elements did bother me. Ben and Maggie are both interesting characters to read about but the added, almost supernatural, element didn't really work for me. I did enjoy Maggie's development throughout the book and I was pleased with the way things ended. I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

It was refreshingly sweet and heart-swelling, and I feel like my heart was about to pound out of my chest any second from all the frantic beating. \nGah.\nWith this, I'd like to point out three things about the three characters:1. Maggie appeared to me as someone who was so full of color, even though she was literally deprived of it because of the loss of her eyesight.\n\"I dreamed in vivid Technicolor: light, color, texture, and sound, all synchronized into movies in my head. But when my world disappeared, the visual quality of my dreams began to fade with each passing night. The emptiness from my waking hours crept in, and my once-bright images blurred, became nebulous, and then finally blinked away, leaving nothing but random voices, thoughts, and ideas.But tonight, I dreamed.\"\n 2. Ben immediately stole my heart. He felt so much more to me than a ten-year-old kid, and to say that he has a heart of gold is putting it mildly. If I were to choose who was my favorite character in this story, it would definitely be Ben.\n\"You were wrong, you know,\" I told him. \"Swimming isn\u2019t your Thing. It never was. Not really. Your Thing isn\u2019t just one Thing, but a lot of Things\u2014being part of a bigger whole, letting others have the glory, proving you\u2019re capable and strong and intelligent.\"I looked up at the ceiling and blinked several times, trying to clear my vision. \"Your Thing is treading carefully through life, refusing to hurt anyone or anything.\" My voice cracked horribly. I brushed away a tear that was scuttling down my cheek before going on. \"Somewhere inside of you, you notice this is good. And so, you swim. You swim to show everyone that, although you don\u2019t always get to choose your circumstances, you can always choose what you notice in them.\"\n 3. Mason was always said to be larger than life, and in a way, he really is. I've had difficulty in cracking his personality during the early parts of the book, but I already knew that I was going to love him just the same, and I did.\n\"Mason sat on the other side of me, resting his elbow on his propped-up knee while he stared at some unknown point on the horizon. He looked as if he were in a photo shoot for Rolling Stone magazine. The thing I was discovering about Mason was that he didn\u2019t try to be larger than life, and this was what actually made him larger than life. He was so understated and so simple that he was grandiose.\"\n I don't want to babble and ruin the simplicity and brilliance of this book, so to simply put, The One Thing was something I couldn't put down. Every page was worth something unimaginable, and I definitely appreciate how Marci Lyn Curtis pieced this together. It was something very magical on its very own. 5 stars for this brilliant piece!"}, {"userName": "Chelsea", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33012180-chelsea", "userReview": "You guys, this book was SO GOOD. If you\u2019ve been following my reviews for a while you know I don\u2019t hand out five star ratings for nothing, and this book wholeheartedly deserves it.I will be the first to say this isn\u2019t a perfect book. It has a number of little flaws that I was well aware of whilst reading it, which made me think to myself, \u2018then is this really a five star book?\u2019And the answer is yes, it definitely is. It got me to thinking about the other four star books I\u2019ve read this year, but even if I loved those books this was just so much more enjoyable in comparison. Every time I picked this up Maggie\u2019s voice would suck me right into the story. Not to mention this book was exactly what I had been craving to read right now.The One Thing is not a book I would typically pick up. It follows a girl named Maggie who was well on her way to becoming a professional soccer player before she fell ill and lost her sight. A few months later Maggie is struggling to adjust to her new lifestyle when she meets a quirky ten year old boy and can suddenly see again when she\u2019s around him.All together, it\u2019s an incredibly adorable story but packs an emotional punch as well.I\u2019m the sort of person who either falls in love with a contemporary novel or gets bored after a few chapters, and this novel was written in a way that was perfectly suited to YA contemporary.Maggie is one of the strongest narrators I\u2019ve ever read. She can be a bit judgmental at times, but she feels so well developed, like a real person I could meet and become friends with. She\u2019s sarcastic at the right times and really essential to making this novel as good as it is.Maggie\u2019s relationships with the other characters are so compelling and wonderful. Her relationship with her parents is developed. Her friendships were so well written, and I absolutely loved her spunky best friend Clarisse.Her dynamic with the young boy, Ben, is absolutely fantastic. Even though it was a little odd at the start, this 17 year old girl hanging out with a 10 year old, I quickly got over that was able to appreciate their snarky and adorable dynamic.The end was emotional and a little cheesy but I loved it all the same. The story wrapped up in a wonderfully satisfying way.I do feel that I should warn you about the very small things I wasn\u2019t a fan of:Ben does not act like a 10 year old in the slightest. I get that he wasn\u2019t really supposed to, but it\u2019s always been a pet peeve of mine when children in books or movies act way older or younger than they\u2019re supposed to be. He acts much older.I also wasn\u2019t a fan of the romance AT ALL. I wanted to like it, but it just wasn\u2019t my thing. It kind of felt unnecessary? Like I already loved the book and the romance really just didn\u2019t work for me, but this might just be me because I tend to be very particular on romances.But other than that, this was an amazing novel. It might have helped that I had no expectations at all going into this and didn\u2019t really even think I was going to like it. But sometimes the best books are the ones you didn\u2019t think you\u2019d like!I absolutely recommend this book to anyone even slightly intrigued! It\u2019s just so well written and adorable, probably one of my favorite books so far this year.

Sie will keine tapfere Kranke sein, und auf Unterricht von anderen Blinden kann sie gut verzichten. Nach einem missgl\u00fcckten Streich passiert es: Sie kann wieder sehen! Nur einen Ausschnitt der Welt, genauer: einen zehnj\u00e4hrigen Jungen namens Ben. Mit Hilfe des altklugen und hinrei\u00dfenden Jungen scheint sie einen Teil ihres alten Lebens zur\u00fcckzubekommen. Und Bens gro\u00dfer Bruder Mason ist S\u00e4nger in Maggies Lieblingsband. Und ziemlich attraktiv. Doch er l\u00e4sst sie abblitzen, weil er denkt, dass Maggie ihre Blindheit vort\u00e4uscht \u2013 was ja irgendwie stimmt. Dann kommt heraus, warum sie ausgerechnet Ben sehen kann. Es ist noch nicht so lange her, dass ich Jane & Miss Tennyson gelesen und dadurch den Verlag f\u00fcr mich entdeckt habe. Allein dadurch schon habe ich von Maggie und ihrer Geschichte einiges erwartet.Ich habe bestimmt schon B\u00fccher gelesen, in denen blinde Personen vorkommen, aber ich m\u00fcsste eine ganze Weile nachdenken, um das sicher sagen zu k\u00f6nnen. Auf jeden Fall haben sie nie eine solch gro\u00dfe in dem jeweiligen Buch gespielt wie hier Maggie. Es ist etwas Besonderes, die Geschichte aus ihrer Sicht zu lesen, ihre Blindheit ist gleichzeitig etwas ganz Anderes, als das, was man kennt und allt\u00e4glich normal. Maggie muss eben damit leben, genau wie ein Mensch, der ein Bein, verliert, damit weiterlebt und seinen Alltag dem anpasst. Ich war nicht sofort so begeistert von dem Buch wie am Ende. In der ersten H\u00e4lfte st\u00f6\u00dft Maggie jeden von sich weg und Teile der Kommentare von ihr und Ben fand ich seltsam. Mehrmals dachte ich beim Lesen: \u201eGut, aber nicht mein Geschmack.\u201c Doch je n\u00e4her Ben und Maggie sich kamen, desto weniger st\u00f6rte es mich, wenn es \u00fcberhaupt noch vorkam. Ben ist mit Abstand mein Lieblingscharakter gewesen, er ist eine Mischung aus dem 10-j\u00e4hrigen Kind, das er ist und jemand viel \u00c4lterem. Ein Beispiel: Der Originaltitel des Buches, The One Thing, bezieht sich auf Ben, der Maggie nach ihrem absoluten Ding fragt und ihr den Rest des Buches lang, nachdem sie sagt, dass sie keins hat, hilft, es zu finden. Und ich finde, da ist von beiden etwas drin, von dem kleinen Jungen Ben und von dem weisen Ben und genau das macht ihn aus.Die Liebesgeschichte zwischen Maggie und Bens Bruder Mason spielt, wie schon in Jane & Miss Tennyson, eine kleinere Rolle. Man merkt erst langsam, dass Mason und Maggie sich n\u00e4her kommen und selbst dann ist das Band zwischen ihnen erst zart und zur\u00fcckhaltend und nicht der Mittelpunkt der Geschichte. Das Buch punktet viel mehr mit Ben und der Geschichte um ihn herum, denn etwa ab dem Moment, als man erfahren hat, wieso Maggie ausgerechnet ihn sehen kann, war ich \u00fcberzeugt und konnte es nicht mehr zur Seite legen.\u00dcber die Autorin:Marci Lyn Curtis wuchs in Nordkalifornien auf, wo sie Biologie studierte.

I read a book about a main character who is blind before in Wattpad and I loved it, so of course I was anticipating this one. I was expecting this to be a bit depressing given the situation, but no. The main character is so snarky and her friend Ben is a ten-year-old smart ass. Gosh, I have so much love for this book, and I read this just at the right moment.The journey that the main character took was fantastic. She didn't rely on anyone else but herself, and she changed mostly for herself too. Yes, Ben and other circumstances were catalysts, but she changed and snapped out of it because of her own realizations and not because she fell in love or was told to do so. This book took me to a roller coaster of emotions; I smiled, laugh, cried and bawled my eyes out. (And yes, I realized that I said cried and bawled my eyes out because those were the stages of my crying.) But what I loved about this book was that even though I cried my eyes out, it made me feel so happy and so full of life. It made me feel so inspired that I just wanted to jump up and start really living. The book was just so honest, so gritty, and so full of life. Romance was not a central part of this story. It was only on the side that Maggie and Mason's romance bloomed, but oh my gosh, I still felt a rush of feels. This book is also filled with lots of amazing quotes, and now my copy is full of pink tabs because there were just a lot of amazing passages. I haven't rated a contemporary book 5 stars in a long time, but this book is no doubt a solid 5! I couldn't even put this book down while I was reading it, and when I absolutely had to, it was like the Choppin + Clarissa song in Maggie's head - it's constantly there on my mind. I was a little sad that this book had to end, but I realized that for me, the story will never end because I will bring it with me in my heart wherever I go. This book is just full of meaning, emotions and life; it's monumental. If you haven't read the book yet, then what the heck are you waiting for? Hurry up and go buy yourself a copy! This is definitely a must-read."}, {"userName": "Karen Rock", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6143255-karen-rock", "userReview": "High school loner, Maggie Sanders, gets the shock of her life when, after years without sight, an encounter with a younger boy, Ben Milton, allows her to see again. Only\u2026 she can only see him and the small area illuminated around him. Not sure if she\u2019s hallucinating or experiencing the greatest miracle possible, she befriends the fascinating boy whose spina bifida doesn\u2019t stop him from appreciating and learning about life- right down to reading through every encyclopedia and joining a swim team. His health-obsessed, vet-tech mother, a great believer in natural treatments to all health problems, is the heart of his off-beat family and welcomes Maggie into the fold. Better yet, Maggie discovers that Ben\u2019s older brother, Mason, is none other than the hot lead singer in her favorite, yet elusive band. Yet Mason isn\u2019t as glad to meet her as he doesn\u2019t buy her story that she\u2019s blind (so hard to fake when she can seem him as long as Ben is around). He believes she\u2019s just using his little brother whom he protects. Thus starts Maggie\u2019s incredible journey toward understanding her ever-growing ability to see certain people, and her growing feelings for Mason, a romance that is as charming and unique as this amazing story.I adored every bit of this \u2018must-read-in-one-sitting\u2019 book (actually it took me all day and half the night\u2026). Maggie is sarcastic, smart, funny, and has a big heart that she\u2019s kept guarded all these lonely years. Ben\u2019s effervescent personality is contagious and you can\u2019t help but fall in love with him, as well as his gorgeous, mysterious older brother, Mason. Ah, Mason. He\u2019s the bad boy with the big heart all of us girls which we\u2019d tamed in high school. It\u2019s wonderful to watch all of these characters grown and change as the novel progresses to its heart-stopping conclusion. This novel will make you laugh, cry and most of all think. Like Maggie, the way you view the world will be profoundly altered after finishing this amazing story. And isn\u2019t that what all great books are about- making us see ourselves and our world in new and amazing ways? I can't wait to read more from this talented author!"}, {"userName": "Catherine Doyle", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26424200-catherine-doyle", "userReview": "\"After all, circumstances don't change us. They reveal us.\"Well. This is definitely one of the best books I've ever read.Ever since 17-year-old soccer star Maggie lost her sight 6 months ago, she's been a passive participant in a life she never imagined for herself. She's angry at the world and she's all but given up. When she meets Ben, an intelligent and hilarious 10-year-old, everything starts to change. He, quite literally, lights up her life, and together they embark on a friendship that is among the most entertaining and heart-warming relationships I've ever had the pleasure of reading. This unassuming kid with a big-toothed smile and an interest in reading entire encyclopaedias breaks apart the darkness in Maggie's world and shows her that life isn't really about what you see but what you choose to notice. Maggie SLAYS as the narrator. She is so real; her disgruntlement at being blind, her sarcasm, her wit, her self-deprecation, her sass, her observational humour all combine to make her one of those people you wish were real so you could hang out with them.And there's a whole host of brilliant characters including Ben's brother -the broody and handsome rockstar, Mason, their hippie, snap-happy mother, Maggie's hilarious gramps, her ambitious, distant mother and her troubled best friend. With Maggie at the helm of such an eclectic group of personalities the story unravels into a soaring tale of life and love, of sacrifice and renewal, and learning to see people as they really are.The One Thing is an inspiring read that grips you on the first page and doesn't let go until long after it's over. It has this wonderful authenticity and charm that will surely make it a great success when it's released next year. I will be so surprised if it doesn't win awards. Seriously. The One Thing is Special."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3122452-nancy", "userReview": "If I made a movie out of this book (because that's totally in my skill set as a suburban mother and public educator), I'd do a montage of Maggie's easy, happy-go-lucky life, lots of soccer, trophies, friends, high school, all to the background music of \"Loose Cannons.\" Quick intro of devoted parents, Gramps talking about his prostate, then a slower montage of the day she woke up sick, the exchange between her and her mom, maybe have Gramps find her passed out in the kitchen, tense hospital scenes, doctors talking in low voices, end song, begin movie as Maggie wakes up blind. Insert uncomfortable scenes of Maggie failing at being blind, and finally introduce Kevin, just a voice. Maybe probation officer, maybe creative liberties taken here and he's her new counselor at her school for the blind. She leaves his office, slips in the hall, hits her head, and opens her eyes to see Ben, age 10. Start script as written. I loved Ben. I loved the developing friendship between Ben and Thera (What Ben called Maggie). I loved Mrs. Milton, and I eventually loved Mason. Rather than give any hints to the story or possible twist (because the real story is adjusting to new normals, making adjustments and figuring out how we connect to others - told via an unconventional friendship between blind Maggie and optimistic Ben and Clarissa), I will only say that it was very enjoyable. And my paraphrased quote that might be exact. I'm too lazy to check. \"Our circumstances do not change us. They reveal us.\" Satisfied sigh.http://amusingreviews.blogspot.com/20..."}, {"userName": "Lola Sharp", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4038636-lola-sharp", "userReview": "Oh my goodness, you guys, YOU WANT TO READ THIS BOOK! I am blessed to have read this treasure, absolute gem of a book, because IT IS SPECIAL.This book is what they talk about when they say 'voice'. There is voice in spades here. Marci Lyn Curtis has given us layered , real characters with a voice that leaps off the page from the very first paragraph. At times snort-out-loud hilarious, this story also had me in tears, both sad and happy, heartwarming tears. I promise, I never gush about a book, but this one has me gushing. Trust me, you want to keep this book on your radar. I know it doesn't come out until '15, but it is worth the wait. I predict Very Big Things and they will be well deserved.If a gun was put to my head to compare THE ONE THING to other books (even though it is unique and the voice is SO perfectly original), I'd say something like: If you took THE SKY IS EVERYWHERE and THE FAULT IN OUR STARS and THE SEA OF TRANQUILITY and they all had a baby, it would be lucky to become THE ONE THING. But, THE ONE THING is definitely its own thing. Five dazzling stars! \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3(note: yes, I am a friend of Marci's, which is how I am lucky enough to have read it. BUT, I'm friends with LOTS of authors and read lots of early manuscripts, and I am always HONEST (or I say nothing at all). While I adore Marci, she's special too, I LOVE this book on the merits of the writing, the VOICE, the characters, and the story.)"}], "description": "Maggie Sanders might be blind, but she won't invite anyone to her pity party. Ever since losing her sight six months ago, Maggie's rebellious streak has taken on a life of its own, culminating with an elaborate school prank. Maggie called it genius. The judge called it illegal.Now Maggie has a probation officer. But she isn't interested in rehabilitation, not when she's still mourning the loss of her professional-soccer dreams, and furious at her so-called friends, who lost interest in her as soon as she could no longer lead the team to victory.Then Maggie's whole world is turned upside down. Somehow, incredibly, she can see again. But only one person: Ben, a precocious ten-year-old unlike anyone she's ever met.Ben's life isn't easy, but he doesn't see limits, only possibilities. After awhile, Maggie starts to realize that losing her sight doesn't have to mean losing everything she dreamed of. Even if what she's currently dreaming of is Mason Milton, the infuriatingly attractive lead singer of Maggie's new favorite band, who just happens to be Ben's brother.But when she learns the real reason she can see Ben, Maggie must find the courage to face a once-unimaginable future... before she loses everything she has grown to love.", "title": "The One Thing", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18369372-the-one-thing", "average": 4.13, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1422879731l/18369372.jpg", "reviews": 431, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7255598.Marci_Lyn_Curtis", "name": "Marci Lyn Curtis"}], "type": ["Young Adult", "Contemporary", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18369372-the-one-thing", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24397042-the-one-thing", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28807511-quello-che-ti-rende-speciale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29846715-te-veo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29543797-alles-was-ich-sehe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29548788-alles-was-ich-sehe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34520598-the-leading-edge-of-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies"]}
