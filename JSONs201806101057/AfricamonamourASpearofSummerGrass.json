I have issues with this one on several levels:\u2022 I should have known this one wouldn't be for me when, in the first few pages, our main character Delilah (<-----oooh symbolism) explains how it's okay that she occasionally sleeps with her ex-husband, who is now married to another woman and has a child with her, because she \"had him first\" and she doesn't intend to ever take him away from his second wife. So it's all good. Um, no. It's not.\u2022 Delilah is a wealthy, privileged white woman who goes to Africa in the 1920's, and finds herself and True Meaning in Life. Unlike almost all other white people, she understands the natives and has sympathy for them. Clich\u00e9 and stereotype overload.\u2022 More adultery: Delilah falls for a guy named--wait for it--Ryder, who's rough and crude and kind of rapey but (of course) very handsome, and who also understands and loves Africa. He's also (I peeked at the end) separated from a wife who's living in Egypt. But it's okay that he cheats on her regularly because, apparently, she's a slut. No, it isn't.Delilah has good qualities but I just didn't want to live with her any longer, or in her world where cheating abounds and no one seems to blink twice about it. I can see how others might really like this book, but it's just not my cuppa."}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "The men stood back, chanting a song of one who would not be forgotten, of loved ones lost and returned to the earth, and of the land itself which does not die but is always born anew with each fall of the long rains. They chanted of life, which is short as a spear of summer grass or long as the heart of the Rift itself, and of the silent land that waits beyond. They chanted of Africa.\n\nMy apologies in advance for the liberal use of quotations within this review. The writing is beautiful, exemplary, and I couldn't help myself.Deanna Raybourn has a skill for writing spectacular settings and believably flawed characters. I have always enjoyed the beautifully vibrant atmosphere she creates, along with the rich and varied characters within her novels, be it her Lady Julia Gray series, or one of her standalones. Her typical repertoire usually takes place in 19th century Europe, and we do have a change of pace here. Nevertheless, the quality of writing still remains, and despite the slow pace of the novel, Deanna Raybourn has once again established her talents as a writer.I have always loved her heroines; they are independent, strong, and not surprisingly in historical novels, ahead of their times. I had mixed reactions to Delilah at first; she is initially not a likeable character. The story is narrated from her first person point of view, and what we know of Delilah in the first hundred or so pages did not endear me to her in the least. Compared to the other heroines in Deanna Raybourn's books, Delilah initially comes off as a typical free-spirited woman of the 20s, spoiled from her wealthy upbringing, loose of morals, with a string of discarded husbands and broken hearts in her wake.We do get initial flashes of vulnerability, but it is more or less upstaged by her antics and her larger than life (and not in a good way) presence. She eats men for breakfast, lunch, and dinner...maybe even brunches and elevensies, too. It would take an entire day's worth of Hobbit meals to fit in all the men she has devoured, left behind, battered and their spirit broken, in her wake.. Delilah spends money like it's water, and is seemingly more interested in clothes, fashion, and being the penultimate trendsetter among her clique of social elites than about the consequences of her actions.Her scandal (and it's not a huge one) is nevertheless enough for her socialite mother, her fair-weather friends, and still-besotted former husbands to want to banish her in order to avoid further disgrace. Delilah is notorious among her set, and that comes with a price of its own.\n\"Notoriety was indeed contagious. If you were a carrier, decent people didn\u2019t care to spend time with you lest they come down with it. Infamy was an infection most folks could do without, even if the price for it was living a very small and colourless life.\"\nFaced between exile and being financially cut off by her wealthy, controlling grandfather, Delilah chooses the former.Africa is her sequestered destination. At this time, British colonization is still firmly in place, and there are quite a few British expatriates living abroad. Africa is a wild place, full of promise and danger, beauty and brutality. The setting is the star here, and in none of her books (not even the one set in Transsylvania!) has Deanna Raybourn built up the atmosphere and the feeling of the place as vividly and distinctly as she has here.\nI heard nothing but the long rush of wind up from the valley floor. It carried with it every promise of Africa, that wind. It smelled of green water and red earth and the animals that roamed it. And there was something more, something old as the rocks. It might have been the smell of the Almighty himself, and I knew there were no words for this place. It was sacred, as no place I had ever been before.\nAfrica may be beautiful, but her new home, Fairlight, is a wreck. \nIt was like being shown a photograph of a winsome orphan one meant to adopt, only to arrive and find the child had rickets and a snotty nose and was dressed in rags. I felt my shoulders sag as I stood, rooted to the spot.\n Once faced with the harsh truth of living on a crumbling estate, surrounded by nature and all the danger it entails, Delilah asserts herself, and we see what kind of a woman she is underneath her glamorous and carefree fa\u00e7ade once it starts to crumble.\u201cYou have always been dazzling\u2014the life of every party, the glamour girl who dances until dawn.\u201d\u201cWell, I am. But I\u2019m dancing on broken glass. I\u2019m Miss Havisham\u2019s wedding cake, Kit. A frothy, expensive, mice-eaten confection. I\u2019m the Sphinx\u2019s nose, the fallen Colossus. I\u2019m a beautiful ruin, and it\u2019s time that has done the deed.\u201dDelilah proves to be no shrinking violet, she plays hands-on nurse relying on her experience during World War I, caring for the sick and injured villagers; she weathers the harsh new lifestyle better than I expected, with unexpected fortitude and her usual carefree attitude. Eventually the story of her past unfolds, and we learn why she hides herself the way she has, why she breezes through life so carelessly so she doesn't have to think about the past. The land and the new situation helps to heals her, but some things can never be entirely fixed.\n\"Do you know what a cicatrix is, Ryder? It\u2019s a scar, a place where you have been cut so deeply that what\u2019s left behind is something quite different. It doesn\u2019t heal, not really, because it isn\u2019t the same ever again. It\u2019s impenetrable and it\u2019s there forever, to protect you from hurting the same place again.\u201d\nThe attitudes of the white colonists range from downright disdain to a paternalistic one. The overwhelming attitude among the white expatriates is one of condescension. They view the natives as one would a child: they do not think the natives capable of taking adequate care of themselves and their land, and this results in rampant poverty, disease, illiteracy, and a decay of morals. The white men are less men than gods, saviors, as they view themselves.Imperial attitudes prevail, and there is an underlying tension between the natives and the white expatriates. Even more evident are the lurking strain between the expatriates themselves; they are small group of people who have been reluctantly thrown together due to their proximity more than their similarity of minds.\n\"Something seemed slightly off with the company. There were undercurrents of tension I didn\u2019t quite understand. In any close group of people there are bound to be secret resentments, and this group was closer than most...But little things could fester in the African heat, and I wondered if any small thorn prick had been left to turn septic.\nThe romance develops slowly, and is believable and painstakingly, subtly portrayed. Both Ryder and Delilah have scarred past, both are scared to become involved. The gradual progress in their relationship is not the backbone of the story, but a result of it. Like Delilah, Ryder is not the most likeable character when we first meet him as he is thrashing the bloody life out of a man. That man turned out to be a wife-beater. Ryder turns out to be the perfect foil for Delilah, he is rough, bluff, and nothing like the sycophantic suitors that she is used to. There is no blind worship in their relationship; they are on equal footing, and he proves to be a match for our heroine.I loved this book, it is like a lullaby. The subplot seems almost forgettable and slow in its pacing; but it is the characters, their growth, and ultimately the landscape itself that makes this book as beautiful as it was. Highly recommended for a lovely, lyrical read."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50378-angie", "userReview": "Originally reviewed here @ AngievilleHave you ever seen Out of Africa? It's this old Sydney Pollack film starring Meryl Streep and Robert Redford, and it is sort of loosely based on Isak Dinesen's (pseudonym of Danish author Karen Blixen) autobiographical book of the same name. I ask because it (and its soundtrack) was a staple in my house growing up, and when I first read the brief synopsis for Deanna Raybourn's latest standalone novel, A SPEAR OF SUMMER GRASS, it was literally the first thing that popped into my mind. They just sounded fairly similar what with the same setting, though the time period is a good decade later in Raybourn's novel than in Pollack's film. Since I have fond memories of the movie as a girl, this only upped my eagerness to read the book. I get all excited when an author I love changes things up on her readers. I am a devoted fan of Raybourn's Lady Julia Grey Victorian mystery series and I thoroughly enjoyed her standalone Gothic novel, The Dead Travel Fast. As far as I was concerned 1920s Africa complete with a British/American flapper fish out of water could only spell bliss.Delilah Drummond is a household name among the London and Paris socialite sets. Daughter of an infamous society wife in her own right, Delilah has worked her way through a few marriages of her own. Unfortunately, the latest crashed and burned so luridly that her mother and current stepfather have called Delilah home for a little Come to Jesus. In fact, they're packing her off to Kenya so she can cool her heels a bit while the scandal back home runs its course. It so happens her stepfather (the best in a long line of her mother's spurious husbands) has an estate called Fairlight on the Kenyan savanna. Accompanied only by her cousin and sometime maid Dodo, Delilah arrives at Fairlight to find the place crumbling around her feet. Determined not to let the man (or men) in her life get her down, she immediately starts issuing orders, procuring help from the local Africans in setting the manor to rights. It doesn't take long for the European expat social life to find Delilah and she is more than happy to dive into the swirling politics and pandering that involves. She even runs across a few old friends in the process, as well as encountering some new ones. Most notably a Canadian transplant by the name of Ryder White--a man as wild as the African wilderness he inhabits and one who just might be larger than life enough to measure up to Delilah herself.I do love this setting and time period. And what a master Deanna Raybourn is at capturing the sights, tastes, and sounds of the worlds her characters inhabit. The descriptions of everything from the scrumptious clothes to the sweeping landscape positively drip with vibrancy. And the writing, as always, is exquisite. Where I ran into trouble was, oddly, with the characters. Delilah is hard as nails. She's as bright and devil-may-care as they come, and she has zero interest in anything that does not involve pleasure. Interestingly, that was not always the case. We are given a few meager hints that indicate a more sedate and driven past, one in which she married for love (for once) and worked as a nurse during the war. All that was smashed to smithereens, of course, and she is who she has become--a woman who barely resembles the girl she once was. Now doesn't that back story sound intriguing? Add to that the truly crushing details of her last marriage and the fallout it must have left somewhere inside her, and we have got ourselves a recipe for some serious character depth and development! The thing is . . . it never happens. I mean it rather dismayingly never happens. The bits of depth we get are distributed seemingly at random, in too small quantities, and in entirely the wrong places to maintain the thread and drive of Delilah's story. The result being that she is by and large wholly unsympathetic. Sort of monumentally callous and insipid, as a matter of fact. She dashes about her story taking pleasure where she will, heedless of the consequences, lifting her hand for a dubious good deed here or there, but more often intentionally risking her neck and courting destruction by toying with the caged lion that is Ryder. Who, by the way, I found little better than Delilah as far as his ability to secure any scrap of my affection goes. The potential was there on the grand scale. But somehow the decadence of Delilah's life and that of almost every other person around her completely overwhelmed the more subtle possibilities of her story. Her relationship with Dodo remained distressingly unexplored. The unfolding of the plot continued flat and unsurprising. And the crisis, when it came, failed to incite my sympathy given how little I cared for anyone affected by it. I finished it feeling tired out and sad. It could have easily gone so very differently. It's worth pointing out that while I can't recommend this one, it is the only misstep I've had from Raybourn, and I wholeheartedly recommend her other books, all of which are on my Beloved Bookshelf."}, {"userName": "Misfit", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1375548-misfit", "userReview": "\"Don't believe the stories you have heard about me.

Delilah is a scandalous woman, an unrepentant, egotistical, multiple-time divorced in the early 20s. After a recent scandal in Paris, she is exiled to Kenya until gossip dies out.Of course, this set-up is potentially problematic for two main reasons:One is that the story could turn into a redemption story because god forbid a female character be unlikable and not-nice. Two is that said redemption will happen because of the Exotic Journey to the Savage Yet Beautiful Africa.Unfortunately, it all happened exactly as I feared.My problems with the book started really soon as Delilah set herself up as the voice of modernity opposing her white neighbours in Kenya. That\u2019s when the book just went all over the place. The novel is a messy mixture of anachronism and stereotyping. So we have Delilah, a white female character female who is modern and \u201cdifferent\u201d \u2013 she is able to see her fellow white expats as privileged idiots, the treatment of local inhabitants as unfair. But by doing that she also sets herself up their White Saviour, completely idealizing colonialism: she treats the locals with her Expert White Nurse Training; she gives them food, she treats them fairly, she learns their language, etc. These are not necessarily bad things if it wasn\u2019t for the way that the novel portrays all the POC characters as simple people, most of them in Communion With Nature; there is a Wise Man who actually communicates with spirits; and everybody is loyal and grateful to the Good White People.It is really important when reading historical novels like this to be able to differentiate between what can be construed as accurate portrayals of privilege, colonialism and racism within the novel itself and what is built on stereotypical portrayals that go unchallenged and therefore are perpetuated instead of questioned.It also doesn\u2019t help that you have these two characters \u2013 Delilah and Ryder \u2013 talking about this ONE location, its peoples and its beauty as \u201cAfrica\u201d as though Africa is not an entire freaking continent.And then we have the \u201cromance\u201d. This is twofold: the romance that happens between Delilah and Africa; and the one that \u201cdevelops\u201d between Delilah and the local hunter-stud-rich white man called Ryder White (no, seriously). Both serve to redeem the heroine and her \u201cterrible ways\u201d. She becomes less egotistical when she learns to care for others. Which: fair enough. BUT then it is revealed that she is not in fact the scandalous person she is supposed to be: no, everything is just how people have interpreted her actions wrongly. This could have served as great social commentary about how people view women socially accept it only reinforces those same traditional views by making Delilah \u201cinnocent\u201d. The romance between Delilah and Ryder is also a no-go from me: it starts with him actually threatening to rape her and ends with her learning everything about him through third parties who help her decide to marry him because He Deserves Her Love. Or something equally disingenuous like that.I also felt really, REALLY uncomfortable about the way domestic abuse is portrayed in the novel. There is one character that is constantly abused and beaten up by her husband and the characters including Delilah, our heroine, and the wife herself are all into victim blaming:\u201cI was only a little surprised Jude was still living with her husband after he had beaten her. I had known my share of women mistreated by their men. But they were all tormented creatures, with eyes like caged animals and a tightly wound intensity that burned them inside. Jude was different, cool as a mountain lake, and I suspected she stayed with Wickenden because his beatings couldn\u2019t really touch her. Perhaps that was WHY he beat her. Some men can only stand to be ignored for so long before they have to do something about it.\u201dThe narrative itself does nothing at all do dispel this idea.Despite its promising beginning this turned out to be terrible \u2013 to be honest, I only kept reading because I couldn\u2019t look away from the train wreck.Thea\u2019s Take:It pains me to say this because I loved Deanna Raybourn\u2019s Lady Julia Grey books, but I sadly, wholeheartedly agree with Ana. I was intrigued by the premise of this book, although that intrigue was tempered with fear \u2013 because, as Ana says, this is a book about a rich white woman going to Africa and becoming a Better Person and\u2026 well, that often spells disaster.First, let me start with the good: I loved the flawed prickly character of Delilah. I love that she is in control, that she doesn\u2019t give a damn about what other people think (in fact, she thrives on scandal and loves herself a good time). Most of all, I loved how sexually comfortable Delilah is in her own skin \u2013 she knows her effect on men, and she uses her charms to get in her kicks. Similarly strong is Deanna Raybourn\u2019s writing, which is as lovely as ever in this book, and she manages to create a group of interesting characters and we watch their lives unfold in a comfortable, natural way.That said, even these high points could not save A Spear of Summer Grass from its deeply problematic issues.My problems with this book are threefold: The Treatment of Women \u2013 which could have been AWESOME but turned into rape-y, wife-beating apologist crap The Treatment of \u201cAfrica\u201d \u2013 exoticism and glorification of colonialism of the White Man The Treatment of the Indigenous Populations of Nairobi (and of ANY people of color for that matter) \u2013 the book imposes interesting/frightening situations of colonialism and white superiority, does not CHALLENGE these ideas at allSo let\u2019s start with women. In this book, there is one particular character who is beaten by her husband. This character doesn\u2019t really CARE that she is beaten because, and I quote:\u201cThe hitting?\u201d She rolled onto her back and stretched. \u201cI feel sorry for him sometimes. He just doesn\u2019t know any way to reach me. \u201d \u201cHe hits you and you feel sorry for him?\u201d \u201cHe loves me more than he\u2019s ever loved anything in his entire life,\u201d she said, relating the words in her cool passionless voice. \u201cAll he wants is to touch me, to move something inside of me so that I will love him back [...] Haven\u2019t you ever seen a small boy trying to get his mother\u2019s attention? He\u2019ll tug at her skirts and call her name, and if she ignores him, he\u2019ll just get louder and louder, poking and pinching until she sees him.\u201dNO. At a different part of the book, Delilah is teasing Ryder (SERIOUSLY HIS NAME IS RYDER. With the \u201cy.\u201d), thinking about getting hot and heavy. When she refuses him, he tells her: \u201cYou understand that we\u2019re alone out here, don\u2019t you, Delilah? There\u2019s not a soul within screaming distance, nobody to hear you, nobody to help you. I could violate you sixty different ways and throw you out for the hyenas to have their way with before anybody ever noticed you were gone.\u201dThis turns Delilah on. Then, later in the book, Delilah is getting it on with Ryder and when he refuses to go the distance, this happens: \u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s all I get? you\u2019ll let me get you good and ready, but then you won\u2019t use it to repay the favour? Naughty, naughty, Ryder. Didn\u2019t anyone ever teach you it\u2019s not nice to be selfish?\u201d His hands were clenching and unclenching on his thighs. \u201cI don\u2019t hit women,\u201d he said, half to himself. \u201cBut you\u2019d like to,\u201d I went on, softly. \u201cYou\u2019d like to put something into me, and if it isn\u2019t going to be what we both want, why not your fist?\u201d I ground out my cigarette on my boot and stood close to him. I picked up his hand, that closed, fisted hand, and I opened it, coaxing the fingers to spread wide. His palm was open and flat, vulnerable, and I pressed my mouth into it, nipping lightly with my teeth.AGAIN, NO. Rape-threatening and woman-beating is NOT hot. This is NOT an attractive trait in a hero (or heroine). Just, NO.Next, there\u2019s the exoticism of \u201cAfrica\u201d \u2013 in quotes because COME ON, it\u2019s a CONTINENT not a SINGLE TOWN or country! A Spear of Summer Grass is the most crude, textbook example of exoticism of a place and its people. Africa \u2013 ALL of Africa! \u2013 is portrayed as a savage but beautiful land, lorded over and being saved by its white aristocratic colonists. These colonists must feed, cure, and educate the indigenous people (heck, even Delilah is a skilled nurse, in addition to being a party gal with deadeye sharpshooter skills). The different tribes are portrayed as ignorant, simple people of the land, ever so grateful for the white man\u2019s help (because otherwise they\u2019d surely perish). Even the non-African characters of color get this treatment \u2013 the Indian characters are similarly meek and simple-natured. The fact that Delilah and Ryder (and Jude to some extent) are the only characters that see this is BAD and fight for the rights of the poor, hapless people of color only reinforces this awful white savior stereotype.The only difference I have here compared to Ana? I could not bring myself to finish this book. It\u2019s a big fat DNF for me."}, {"userName": "Janga", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1206531-janga", "userReview": "I had a really difficult time deciding how to \u201cgrade\u201d this book. Deanna Raybourn is an amazing writer, and her skills are evident from the opening line to the final one. Her vivid descriptions of Kenya frequently made me feel as if I were watching a movie on a theater screen rather than reading a book. That was the effect of this description:A tiny herd of elephants looked infinitesimal from our lofty height, and when Ryder stilled the engine, I heard nothing but the long rush of wind up from the valley floor. It carried with it every promise of Africa, that wind. It smelled of green water and red earth and the animals that roamed it. And there was something more, something old as the rocks. It might have been the smell of the Almighty himself, and I knew there were no words for this place. It was sacred, as no place I had ever been before.Her prose is always beautifully lucid and often lyrical as well. When Delilah arrives at Fairlight expecting to see the place she had imagined when she was a child and finds instead a house falling apart, she expresses her disillusionment:Of all emotions, disappointment is the most difficult to hide. Rage, hatred, envy\u2014those are easy to mask. But disappointment strikes to the heart of the child within us, resurrecting every unsatisfactory Christmas, every failed wish made on a shooting star.The poignancy of some passages is powerfully moving, as in this passage when Delilah responds to Dodo's question about whether Delilah ever loved any of the men in her life after her first husband:You close your eyes and suddenly he\u2019s not there anymore. What you loved, or thought you loved, just isn\u2019t there, and there is a man-shaped hole in your memory of where he used to be. The sad part is when it happens when he\u2019s sitting at the same table or lying in the same bed. You can turn and look at him and not even remember his name because he was just a visitor. He was a man who was only passing through your heart, and you never really made a place for him, so he just keeps passing. My husbands since Johnny have been passing men. Not a stayer among them.At the other end of the emotional spectrum are tiny details that left me with a delighted smile, details such as Delilah\u2019s car, a lipstick-red Hispano-Suiza with leopard upholstery that seems perfect for her and also evoked images of the Hispano-Suiza in P. G. Wodehouse\u2019s Blandings Castle short stories and novels and the book, Fordyce\u2019s Sermons, which Delilah had to balance on her head when learning to walk like a lady. (Fordyce\u2019s Sermons is the 1767 guidebook to female conduct from which Mr. Collins read to the Bennet sisters in Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice.)In the con column is a heroine I could not like. Delilah is at times entertaining, she is more rarely sympathetic, and she is always interesting, but she is also, for much of the book, selfish, shallow, and amoral. She treats her cousin with condescension some times and with careless cruelty at other times. When she spends her last night in Paris with former husband #2, a married man with two young children, she thinks she may even be rendering a service to his wife since he\u2019s jollier after sex with Delilah and the guilt over his infidelity leads him to purchase an expensive present for his wife. The list of her offenses that the lieutenant governor in Nairobi names include \u201cstealing a car outside a Harlem nightclub and driving it into the Hudson\u201d and being \u201ccaught in flagrante with a judge\u2019s eighteen-year-old son in Dallas.\u201d Granted Delilah changes, but by that time, I disliked so many things about her that I could not feel any real connection with her. I\u2019m not a reader who needs to identify with the heroine, but I do, especially with the intimacy between character and reader that comes with a first person point of view, need to like her.If the vivid evocation of time and place, an atypical heroine and hero, and wonderful prose are sufficient to make you love a book, you may be one of the readers giving A Spear of Summer Grass high marks. If likeable characters are a prime criterion for you, you may, as I did, have mixed reactions to this novel.See full review at The Romance Dish:http://www.theromancedish.com/2013/04..."}, {"userName": "Caz", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4368838-caz", "userReview": "4.5 starsI\u2019ve read and enjoyed Ms Raybourn\u2019s Lady Julia Grey books, so when I saw she\u2019d written a story set in the 1920s, I was intrigued and at the same time a little apprehensive. Not only was the author treading new ground, but so was I \u2013 my taste in historicals tends to run to the 17th, 18th and 19th Centuries. Maybe because I was born and grew up in the second half of the 20th Century, it\u2019s still a little too close for me to really regard it as \u201chistorical\u201d! Fortunately, however, my apprehension was quickly proved groundless, because A Spear of Summer Grass grabbed me from the start.Delilah Drummond is presented as the epitome of the 20s good-time girl. She\u2019s rich, spoiled, does exactly as she likes and doesn\u2019t care who she shocks or upsets along the way. She\u2019s been married three times (widowed twice, divorced once) regularly takes lovers (including her ex-husband on occasion) without a second thought and has a taste for all the good things in life.At the beginning of the book however, she has caused one scandal too many for the liking of her family, and she is sent to rusticate in Africa until such time as the gossip has died down and she can return to Europe.Even in Africa though, she continues to ruffle feathers, mostly because of the fact that she treats the natives as people and takes upon herself the traditional duties of the \u2018lady of the manor\u2019 in treating their illnesses and making sure her workers are adequately fed and well-treated. She is immediately adopted by the local ex-patriots, who are real bunch of misfits, having nothing in common other than their presence in Africa and a thinly veiled dislike of each other. One of the first of these ex-pats encountered by Delilah is Ryder White, who makes his living principally from safari-guiding. He\u2019s sort of a cross between Indiana Jones and Allan Quartermain (I can\u2019t help wondering if J. Ryder White is an hommage to H. Rider Haggard) although rather more promiscuous than either of them. But he's a compelling character; ruggedly masculine, with a good sense of humour and an air of vulnerability and fatalism about him that sometimes belies the steely exterior. Ryder escorts Delilah to Fairlight, the estate owned by her stepfather. To her dismay, it\u2019s a mess \u2013 but being Delilah she doesn\u2019t let it deter her and with the help of her cousin and companion Dora, and local workmen, she sets about putting things to rights.I\u2019ve seen a number of comments from other readers pointing out the similarities between this story and Karen Blixen\u2019s Out of Africa. I confess I\u2019ve not read her book, and it\u2019s been quite a long time since I\u2019ve seen the film, so I don\u2019t want to comment on that. All I\u2019ll say is that if that is the case, it didn\u2019t stop me enjoying Delilah\u2019s story.In Delilah Drummond, Ms Raybourn has created a character that, to quote Jane Austen (on Emma) \u201cno one but myself will much like\u201d. Perhaps we\u2019re not supposed to like her all that much in the beginning, but like her or not, she\u2019s ballsy, courageous and outspoken, and isn\u2019t afraid to admit to her own shortcomings \u2013 well, some of them. Of course, behind the highly polished exterior lies a wealth of pain and doubt, a woman who has experienced more than her fair share of loss and heartbreak. As she says to her lover, Kit \u2013 \u201cLike every bad thing that\u2019s ever happened to me, I lock it up and don\u2019t think about it.\u201dIn terms of the love story in the novel, I think there are actually two. The relationship between Delilah and Ryder develops slowly to start with. There\u2019s a strong current of mutual attraction and antagonism between them, and the sexual tension fairly crackles as they play a game of one-upmanship as to who will seduce whom. But alongside the human romance is the story of how Delilah is seduced by Africa; the sights, the sounds, the smells, the customs and kindness of the people, and how she is changed by it.My one complaint is that the romance between Delilah and Ryder could have been better developed. It was clear that they wanted each other physically and that they bonded through an understanding of the life and customs of the country. But these were two emotionally prickly people, and I felt there needed to be more said between them. I\u2019m not really a fan of the plotline in which one of the protagonists has to be alerted as to how the other feels about them by a third party; and Ryder\u2019s actions at the end of the book when he ploughs everything he owns into Fairlight for Delilah\u2019s sake but without any certainty of her reciprocation seemed rather out of character for the man we\u2019ve encountered throughout the rest of the novel.Those reservations aside however, A Spear of Summer Grass has much to recommend it, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It\u2019s superbly written and well-paced, the characterisation is excellent throughout and Ms Raybourn\u2019s descriptions of the scenery and landscape are simply ravishing.With thanks to Harlequin/MIRA and NetGalley for the review copy.(Incidentally, more of Ryder\u2019s backstory is revealed in the prequel novella Far in the Wilds, and I don\u2019t think it has to be read before Spear. I read it afterwards and enjoyed getting the full story of some of the events alluded to in the novel in retrospect.)"}, {"userName": "Giedre", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5487874-giedre", "userReview": "3.5/5Don\u2019t believe the stories you have heard about me. I have never killed anyone, and I have never stolen another woman\u2019s husband. Oh, if I find one lying around unattended, I might climb on, but I never took one that didn\u2019t want taking.Ah, Delilah. A 1920s party girl determined to shag away, drink away and/or outrun heartbreak will not be a heroine to everyone's taste. Delilah is what people like to call an \"unlikeable heroine\". It is a term I don't particularly care for, because of the things it implies, but there you go. Obviously, I liked Delilah just fine. Her character arc is the best thing about the novel. Well, that and the beautiful prose. I wasn't as impressed with Delilah's romance with Ryder, the hero, since I couldn't entirely make up my mind if I wanted her to kiss him or kick him. But that romance took a backseat to Delilah falling in love with Africa, so it wasn't that big of a flaw. The last third is where the book stumbled more noticeably. The murder mystery subplot felt more superfluous than anything else. There was sufficient conflict between Delilah and her farm manager without adding the murder of another character and letting the former conveniently resolve itself without anybody's help. Still, A Spear of Summer Grass is definitely my favourite of the Deanna Raybourn standalones I've read so far."}, {"userName": "Delilah Dawson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4588726-delilah-dawson", "userReview": "An utterly stunning stand-alone title from one of my favorite authors.

Once again, she crafts a perfect opening line \u2013 opening paragraph, truly \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t believe the stories you have heard about me.\u201d And with that single sentence, a reader wants to know what, exactly, those stories are. It is the ultimate invitation to witness a bit of chic wickedness, clothed in scarlet, circled in smoke. If Delilah Drummond offers you a drink (gin and tonic, most likely), you would gladly take it. If she levels a gun at you, you would do well to run.Imagine a New Orleans-born Dorothy Parker, given to Paris society. Picture her in 1923, with a bob sleek enough to cut glass \u2013 and a tongue sharp enough to scar a heart. Delilah is a wild one, a woman with a backbone who does exactly what \u2013 and whom \u2013 she pleases, with no regard for society\u2019s demands. She is, after all, \u201cnobody\u2019s best example\u201d (177). However, she can handle a gun as deftly as any man, which comes in handy when, after one too many scandals, the it-girl is banished to Africa until the media circus moves on.There she arrives, with her plain and sullen cousin Dora, to an expected world rife with expected and unexpected predators. Just as she\u2019s stepping off the train, Delilah meets a man as formidable as Rochester and Lord Byron (mad, bad, and dangerous to know), but as wild as lions he so expertly hunts. Ryder is not one to suffer fools, and his temper is only guided by a strong sense of justice \u2013 an oddly founded morality that serves him well. Thrown together by circumstance, the two form a tenuous relationship, one predicated not strictly on a game of cat-and-mouse \u2013 but of two equal people who worship their own walls. Broken and troubled, but fierce, both possess scars \u2013 seen and unseen. Their relationship is shaded by their own difficult, tumultuous pasts \u2013 and yet, there is a mutual respect that falls between them, breathtaking as any African sunset.Delilah takes up residence at a house belonging to her ex-stepfather, Nigel. Fairlight is full of potential, but has fallen into disrepair. Delilah and her cousin begin to set things to right, but the resistance they are met with, at turns, is palpable. Situated amid a gaggle of displaced acquaintances, including an artist and dalliance of Delilah\u2019s (Kit), Delilah comes into her own and starts letting people in, whether or not she realizes it. Troubling as any lion, Kenya is rampant with change and a shifting political landscape, as the colony\u2019s British rule is uncertain. Delilah quickly learns that nothing is exactly as it seems, and she must navigate its numbered dangers. True to her tenacious persona, she takes no quarter from anyone, man or beast, while waiting out her sentence.But a landscape is often a living thing, as much a character as any person. Delilah finds herself in a love affair with Kenya and its people \u2013 but is it enough to keep her there? And, for that matter, is Ryder? A charming and dangerous man, when he murmurs, \u201cSin with me,\u201d it is seduction at its best. While Delilah may be his match, she is no stranger to art of manipulation \u2013 a spider to any willing fly. Yet, as Ryder points out, some scars are visible \u2013 while others are easily hidden, like a woman who has \u201cbeen holding hands with ghosts for too long\u201d (348). Delilah might be the dazzling party girl, with a bright red mouth, but she is \u201cdancing on broken glass\u201d (231). What makes Delilah\u2019s forgivable \u2013 and even likeable \u2013 is that she\u2019s layered. She\u2019s what is easily seen by prying eyes and flashbulbs. And yet, she is also a whole world of history that\u2019s never truly been witnessed. Her walls are built with care and reason, perhaps with less of an eye toward keeping people out \u2013 and more as a means of self-protection.Deanna Raybourn\u2019s deft hand crafted a novel that is full of sharp wit, vibrant characters, and exceptional plot twists. (No, I\u2019m not giving them away. But I will say this: Rosebud is a sled. And Han shot first.) Nestled within a dangerously beautiful country, she tackles the idea of identity, belonging, and owning who you are \u2013 and facing who you could be. This is very much a novel about finding yourself in the last place you expect. It is about burning everything to the ground and starting again, because sometimes, ashes make the most fertile soil. It may look like a wreck and a ruin at first, but every disaster is an opportunity \u2013 as Delilah certainly discovers. At one point, she muses, \u201cYou had to love someone completely to be willing to destroy them\u201d (230). The reverse is also true: you must love someone completely to let them destroy you. But that is, truly, the only way we let anyone in, by tearing the walls down. What better place to tear those walls down than on an adventure?It should be noted that I was lucky enough to be given an ARC of A Spear of Summer Grass by Deanna. I was not otherwise compensated or bribed in any manner, and this review was entirely my own idea. I do believe that\u2019s enough disclaimer, before I simply tell you: you want to read this book. It is beautiful and wicked, with enough verbal calisthenics and divinely smeared red lipstick to demand that you read quicker than you thought possible. This is a book that will keep you up until the wee hours of the night, reading beneath the sheets with a flashlight. And truly, who wouldn\u2019t want to take Ryder to bed? Or Delilah for that matter?A Spear of Summer Grass is available April 30.

This is not a dealbreaker by any means, but there just wasn't the growth that I'd hoped for with this character, who began with a lot of potential. Ryder (a pun, I am guessing?), the romantic interest is a cardboard cut-out who likes to tell Delilah how he could rape her and then throw her in the bushes for the animals and no one would know.

She loves to point out that Delilah may be many things, but she is NOT a racist to the poor indigenous Africans, unlike everyone else. Then there is Africa.

I really did not enjoy her last standalone book The Dead Travel Fast, but this one sounded so interesting I was excited to give it a go. I was very disappointed.Quite frankly, this book was a bit of a mess from start to finish. The main characters are developed in sudden bits and pieces, and don't really make sense. The other white settlers are pretty awful, and pretty flat in most cases, and while I really liked Gideon and Moses and the other African natives, I think there was a lot of problematic \"white savior\" elements which isn't very surprising from such a setting, but were not addressed like they could have been and left a not-so-nice taste in my mouth. The other thing which really bugged me was Ryder basically threatening to rape Delilah, while outdoors alone with her, made even worse as from the beginning he is established as her protector in the wilds of Africa - yet this instance isn't a big deal at all. Delilah and Ryder are not well-developed characters, as much as all the random information about them that's thrown at us tries to do so - they come out with things in conversation that just don't make sense. I'm still not sure exactly how old Delilah is, but despite her apparent age, multiple marriages, and continent-crossing travels, she seems stupidly immature, which makes the wise things she sometimes says all the more jarring. Their romance was so hot and cold and contradictory that I lost interest, and it was just rather boring in the end. The plot was all over the place, and despite the numerous and varied Big Events of the book, it all kind of felt like filler, for Delilah to fall in love with Africa...well, the small specific part of Africa near Nairobi, but it's all just \"Africa\".I really enjoyed the setting, and for that alone I was determined to finish it, but I kept hoping it would get better and it never did."}, {"userName": "Doll Noa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3971569-doll-noa", "userReview": "Incredible.

The story follows scandalized American socialite Delilah Drummond as she flees scrutiny over the somewhat suspicious circumstances of her latest husband's death by journeying as far from the public eye as possible: her former stepfather's estate in Kenya. I was instantly captivated by Delilah, whose fresh, sardonic voice and pragmatic yet privileged nature make her an intriguing and compelling--though far from perfect--heroine. Having met rugged, rigid adventurer Ryder White in the prequel novella, Far in the Wilds, I was looking forward to the moment these two seemingly opposite yet surprisingly similar people from vastly different backgrounds and life experiences would meet.The story world is vibrant and pulsing with life. Lush, exotic, and wild, Africa seduces Delilah from the moment she arrives, and mesmerizes the reader with its heady mix of danger and beauty. As Delilah navigates a strange and intoxicating new world amid an eclectic assortment of British expatriots, faced with the responsibilities of an over-burdened estate and an ever-present undercurrent of danger as tensions rise in Kenya's quest for independence, tribal rivalries and prejudices run rampant, and wild animals reign supreme, Ms. Raybourn's depiction of Kenya becomes a living, breathing diorama of a land that is as unforgiving and hostile as it is inspiring and magnificent. Delilah settles into her temporary new life and finds herself slowly swept up in the magic of Africa, and in the reality of Ryder, though her independent, guarded nature fights it tooth and nail. As she faces one trying situation after another, she is forced to confront her mistakes and the ghosts of her past. And when her newfound community is rocked by a shocking crime, she realizes the land and the people--and Ryder--need her just as much as she needs them. But does she have the courage to fight for what's right, to take a chance on an uncertain future, to pledge her heart and soul to someone else's welfare after a lifetime of self-centered existence?For all that I adored Delilah and relished her journey from spoiled, self-involved good-time chaser to compassionate, purpose-driven Bibi, I couldn't help but feel like I'd been held a bit at arm's length, and if I hadn't already read Far in the Wilds, I don't know that I would have grasped the essence of Ryder as well. And I kind of felt like Delilah and Ryder got off easy after an entire novel of sexual tension and pushing and pulling and denying their feelings for each other by having an outside influence intervene in bringing them together, and I really would have liked to see more interaction between them before their arc came together so swiftly at the end.But all's well that end's well, and overall the story satisfies as all of Ms. Raybourn's stories do. The vivid description and well-researched snapshot of the political and cultural climate of a different and fascinating historical setting combine with larger than life characters for a delicious read for fans of historical fiction."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "Wow!

I enjoyed all of the supporting characters and thought they were well drawn. I liked the relationships Delilah developed when she arrived in Africa. The conflicts in Kenya made for an interesting backdrop for the story and the pacing was good. The mystery portion of the story added tension but the ending with the murderer's confession and the response to that confession felt forced and unrealistic.There were other things that felt force and unrealistic that detracted from my enjoyment of the novel, most of them involved the relationship between Delilah and Ryder.

I picked up A Spear of Summer Grass knowing from reviews that it's nothing like the Lady Julia books and hoping I would love it anyway. I believe the mark of a good author is that they can write books that don't feel like clones of each other, or like attempts to recapture a magic that has succeeded before. In this book, Raybourn accomplishes a completely new work. A Spear of Summer Grass has its own distinct purpose and feeling, almost like it was written by someone else. I was impressed that this colonial Africa felt completely alive to me, just as Victorian London is brought to life in Raybourn's other books. The setting is Kenya in the 1920s. It's a brutal, vivid landscape. Delilah is a woman with scandalous moral views - she has had multiple husbands and lovers, and takes multiple lovers in this book. It's much more adult in that way, and I had a hard time liking Delilah because of her casual approach to such affairs. She is consistent, however, and she also grows up during her time in Africa. She encounters dangers of the wild and dangers caused by politics of white people in power. I really enjoyed her interactions with the Masai, and Delilah finally won me over with her independence, her views and actions on equality, and ultimately her selflessness. Raybourn has demonstrated her ability to bring setting and characters to life in more than one flavor, and I admire her for it. Did I love it as much as Lady Julia?

I am normally a very fast reader, but in this book I found myself slowing down just to savor the way she told the story. Not an ill-chosen word nor a misplaced phrase, it was truly lovely to read.I am a longtime fan of the Lady Julia and Brisbane series. Be forewarned: Delilah is no Julia. She is a very complex heroine of a different era, and she has quite a journey in ASOSG. Some readers will not like her because of the choices she makes, but it is essentially her character development that drives the story. Ryder is quite a wonderful hero; it is impossible not to fall a little bit in love with him. But read Far in the Wilds (a novella prequel) before you start this book; it definitely enriches the reader's perception of him. I can't end without mentioning the third major \"character\" - Africa itself, more specifically Kenya in the colonial period of the 20th century. Ms. Raybourn's depiction of this era is magnificent enough to enthrall a reader who usually skims through descriptive passages (that would be me).When I taught middle school literature, we used the terms \"stretcher\" and \"grabber\" to describe books. This book was both for me. It \"grabbed\" me right from the beginning, but it also \"stretched\" me to accept a character I did not initially like.

Oh, if I find one lying around unattended, I might climb on, but I never took one that didn't want taking.\"As soon as I read these opening lines, I sighed happily, knowing I was going to love this book. Deanna Raybourn is best known for her Lady Julia series of Victorian murder mysteries, and so A Spear of Summer Grass is a new departure for her. Set during the Roaring 20s, it tells the story of the scandalous debutante Delilah Drummond who has caused one scandal too many and so is banished to Kenya. Her voice is pitch-perfect. She\u2019s sassy, cynical, and smart, yet there is a touch of pathos and vulnerability about her which makes her a far more interesting character than you might expect. In Kenya, Delilah gets caught up in the social whirl of the white landowners, makes unexpected friends, takes a lover and falls in love (not with the same man), and finds herself accused of murder. An utterly brilliant book, and one of the most enjoyable reads of the year so far for me."}, {"userName": "Kathy ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/971945-kathy", "userReview": "I have been a fan of Deanna Raybourn since reading her first Lady Julia Gray novel in that series. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters of Lady Julia and Brisbane, along with the mystery plots and the historical aspects. I was a bit apprehensive about Ms. Raybourn's venture into another character and romantic pairing. Alas, I worried for nothing. A Spear of Grass with Delilah Drummond and Ryder White as the main characters is another hit for this engaging author. Although Delilah starts out as someone not so admirable, her exodus to Africa after a scandalous event changes everything, most importantly what she values in life. Raybourn does an exceptinal job of bringing the scenery and people of 1920's Africa to life and persuading the reader that the country is indeed capable of stirring deep feelings and life changes. Reminiscent of another well-known novel, Out of Africa, this novel appeals to the romantic draw of Africa to instill courage and wonder. Delilah is in keeping with the author's other female lead, Julia Gray, in that both are women who have been hurt by love and who are determined to be independent and strong, to live life on their own terms. Delilah is face with the obstacles that all white settlers encountered in 1920's Kenya, but her choice to take a human interest in the local tribes, the people who worked for her, proves to add both more difficulties and more meaning to her Africa experience. Ryder is the local hunting expert, in addition to being a rather prosperous investor in the land, who is able to see Delilah as more than just a flighty socialite that intends to do her time in Africa and leave. The supporting cast of characters are as well-developed in their roles as are Ryder and Delilah in theirs. The storyline will take you racing through the book, and you might want to prepare for some late night reading. One of the aspects of Deanna Raybourn's writing became evident to me only after meeting her at a book festival. She has a delightful twinkle in her eye and her demeanor that is carried over to her lead characters, a twinkle that is life affirming in its ability to find pleasure and joy in one's path in the world. It contains a hint of mischief, a touch of compassion, and an interest in people for who they are and where they're going. Ms. Raybourn herself encapsulates the very best qualities of her characters and, like her novels, leaves you feeling better and lighter than you were before you met. Hope for a better day and a better world is an unexpected bonus from your time spent with the author and her tales. If that doesn't deserve a 5 star rating, then we might want to reassess for what reasons we use a 5."}, {"userName": "Linda Baker", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2530071-linda-baker", "userReview": "It is Paris in 1923 and Delilah Drummond is in hot water- again. Twice widowed and once divorced before the age of 30, the circumstances of her latest husband's death have even Delilah's own scandalous mother horrified. Delilah's behavior is beyond the pale even for the wide-open flapper era. As a result Delilah is to be exiled to Kenya until the furor dies down. Since she is in imminent danger of losing her allowance from her wealthy American grandfather, she agrees and sets off to Kenya with only her mousy cousin Dora as a companion.When Delilah and Dora arrive at Fairlight, her stepfather's Kenyan farm, she finds a house in decay, a farm lying fallow and an absent farm manager. Dora and Delilah immediately begin making Fairlight livable again. There is plenty of British ex-pat society as well, most of it decadent. Delilah falls right in with the group, as she knows most of them from her past. There is also Ryder White, a Canadian hunter and guide who is accepted into that ex-pat society, but somehow stands apart from it's worst excesses. Delilah quickly falls in love with Africa; it's heat, light, odors and especially it's people. When a murder occurs among the British group Delilah must choose what is really important to her.Deanna Raybourn is one of my favorite authors. Her Lady Jane and Brisbane series is a must read for me and I also enjoyed The Dead Travel Fast. Raybourn has a wonderful ability to evoke places and times with her descriptions and A Spear of Summer Grass is no exception. The Africa of the early 1920's comes alive. Reminiscent of both Out of Africa and the notorious White Mischief murder case of 1940, A Spear of Summer Grass is a portrait of the Kenyan Colonial era and a splendid page turner.Delilah herself is not- at least in the beginning- a likable character. She is spoiled, selfish and somewhat amoral. As the book progressed I came to understand why she is so hard-shelled. Her upbringing and the losses she has suffered have made her retreat behind a brittle shell. Africa, however, slowly breaks down her barriers.

As I read I could smell the cigarette smoke, hear the clinking of ice, and just feel the energy rolling off the pages. Deanna Raybourn is a remarkable artist. The scenes she paints are vivid and clear and authentic. Africa itself was a character and so richly portrayed. You can't help but feel the heat and sweat sticking to your back while turning the pages. The main character's voice is very strong, I felt as though I were her the moment I picked up the book. I loved the way the story unwinds and how each person interacts with the other. The characters are very interesting and deep. The ending of the book was just perfect. I do have to be honest, Africa is not my favorite place to read about. Africa in 1910-20s not where I'd want to be, for sure. That being said, I still loved it. I respected their feelings and relationship with Africa although I still wouldn't want to ever live there myself! I guess I'm just not rough enough. I recommend you give this a good thorough read. You'll be thinking about it days and days after you finish it. I have read all of Deanna's books, and have loved them all.

It was pretty darn good.Unfortunately, A Spear of Summer Grass and I didn\u2019t get off to the best start. Delilah Drummond is NOT a likable gal in the beginning. Trying to relate to her?

Delilah Drummond thrives on scandal. The quintessential flapper, she\u2019s the life of the party, basking in male attention, always the center of the action, never known to turn down a drink, a cigarette, or a lover. But when the latest uproar refuses to die down and Delilah\u2019s escapades threaten to embarrass not just her hard-partying mother but her moneybags grandfather, drastic action is needed, and Delilah is packed off to her stepfather\u2019s Kenyan estate to cool her heels and wait for the media vultures to move on to the new scandal du jour.Delilah is not one to go quietly \u2014 anywhere \u2014 and as she settles into life in Africa, she makes waves among the colonial government officials as well as among the upper class white settlers in her social mix. Yet at the same time, Delilah is charmed by the wildness and danger of her African surroundings and throws herself into the responsibilities of being mistress of an estate, treating the Kikuyu and Masai tribespeople with friendship and dignity.Not that Delilah has abandoned her wild ways. She attracts the eyes of every adult male in the vicinity, and proceeds to wrap each and every one around her little finger, keeping them as objects of flirtation and sometimes more, but never letting anyone close enough to actually touch her heart. Only one man, enigmatic hunter Ryder White, seems immune to her wiles, and it\u2019s this man who both captivates Delilah and is perhaps an equal for her strong-willed nature.Delilah and Ryder have a bit of a Scarlett and Rhett vibe going for them. She\u2019s used to being the belle of the ball, accustomed to having every man fall all over her to please and pamper her, hoping for just a bit of her attention and favor. Ryder is somewhat of a scoundrel; he\u2019s respectable enough, but he goes his own way, society\u2019s opinion be damned. They attract, repel, and frustrate each other. The physical attraction is certainly strong, and Ryder is perhaps the one man who can hold his own against Delilah. The outcome of the will-they, won\u2019t-they dynamic is never really in question \u2014 it\u2019s clear that these two are made for one another \u2014 but the getting there is tumultuous, to say the least.There\u2019s a lot to really like about A Spear of Summer Grass. The African landscapes and wildlife are described in lush detail. You can practically hear the wind through the savannah and smell the wildness in the air. It\u2019s easy to see how the various characters, often against their will, get caught up in their lives in Kenya and can\u2019t pull themselves away. I enjoyed Delilah\u2019s transformation from spoiled party princess to something more, a woman of character. Delilah\u2019s past is hinted at from the start, but over the course of the book we come to understand the suffering she endured as a result of world war, the losses that caused her to wall off her heart from any hint of vulnerability, and the slow evolution she undergoes as she starts, finally, to live and feel once again.Ryder is, of course, a typical manly man with a heart of gold, quick to punish wrongdoers but dedicated to protecting the weak, whether people or animals, and righting wrongs wherever he sees them. Of course, he\u2019s incredibly handsome in a rugged, Indiana Jones-ish way, and that doesn\u2019t hurt in the least.The author does a skillful job of portraying the flavor of expatriate life in colonial Kenya, showcasing the decadent lifestyle of the rich, white settlers, their loose morality, and their unwise indifference to the non-white majority of the country. The scandals, gossip, drinking, and sexual looseness all work perfectly to create a sense of a society adrift and out of touch with the world around them. Visually, there are some remarkable small moments, such as Delilah\u2019s fine silks and delicate shoes falling victim to the blood and dust of Africa \u2014 details that convey deliciously the feeling of life lived on the edge of the wild.What worked less well for me was the inevitability of the romance between Delilah and Ryder. The battle of wills notwithstanding, it\u2019s obvious from the start that Delilah and Ryder are going to end up together, and there was nothing about their developing relationship that didn\u2019t feel like something I\u2019ve seen before. In fact \u2014 although this might be contrary to how these things usually go in popular fiction \u2014 I think A Spear of Summer Grass might have been a stronger story without the romantic subplot. In and of herself, Delilah is an interesting, strong-willed, trouble-making heroine, and I would have been perfectly content reading a novel that focused on her personal journey without the complication of her lovers and admirers.That said, I did absolutely enjoy reading A Spear of Summer Grass, so much so that I stayed up past midnight to finish it and had dreams full of safaris and African skies. After finishing this book, I discovered that the author has also published a prequel, Far in the Wilds, as an ebook, and yes, of course I\u2019m going to read it!Review copy courtesy of Harlequin MIRA via Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Blake", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7152558-blake", "userReview": "You know the saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t judge a book by its cover\u201d? Even in this case, it is true. A SPEAR OF SUMMER GRASS contains every bit the exoticism, beauty, and romance evoked in the picture above AND MORE. The beautifully composed story inside is breathtaking -- beyond anything an artist could capture on canvas. Filled with decadence, danger, passion, and heartbreak, it is the tale of a glamorous and damaged woman\u2019s journey of self discovery.As the summary suggests, the notorious Delilah Drummond is not your typical heroine. In fact, when we first meet the thrice wed, sleek, sexy, make no apologies flapper, her conduct seems anything BUT befitting a protagonist. Delilah\u2019s latest scandal has resulted in the threat of legal action and, desperate to avoid unwanted attention from the press and her grandfather\u2019s snip of the purse strings, it is decided that Delilah\u2019s best bet is to lay low for awhile\u2026 in Africa.Delilah sets off for her former step-father\u2019s estate in Kenya with her cousin, and dutiful chaperone, Dora in tow. A study in contrasts, Dora is as dull as Delilah is dynamic, and some of the wittiest moments in this novel occur at the expense of poor old \u201cDodo\u201d. But like the yin and yang, there is balance in the contrast between the cousins; they are two opposites that co-exist in harmony (for the most part) and it is through Delilah\u2019s interactions with Dora that we catch our first glimpse of what lies beneath Delilah\u2019s powdered and painted party girl veneer.Delilah and Dora are as different as night and day, but our headstrong heroine and our hero, J. Ryder White, are very similar indeed. Just like Delilah, Ryder has a commanding yet easy presence, and sex appeal that nearly lights the pages on fire. He is as mysterious as he is skilled at navigating the harsh and beautiful land of Africa. And to the surprise of the \u201cPrincess\u201d who \u2018\u2026 collected [handsome men\u2019s smiles] like other women collected air to breathe.\u2019(141), Delilah quickly discovers that she has met her match in the game of seduction.As she adjusts to her temporary life in exile, Delilah finds that Africa holds many more surprises. With old acquaintances settled nearby, the creature comforts of Paris -- champagne, gossip, and dalliance -- are still very much within her grasp. But as she is thrust into a role of responsibility, forming alliances with Ryder and people of neighboring tribes, Delilah can no longer ignore the pull of Africa and the things that truly matter.One of the strongest characters in this novel is Africa itself; the harsh, relentless beauty of the land and its creatures, the diversity and strength of its people. In a beautifully poetic way, Deanna Raybourn paints a vibrant picture of Africa as grand and breathtaking as a Thomas Cole landscape: \u201cThe sun was dipping low to the ground, brushing the last of its warm rays over the shimmering surface, and turning the waters to molten gold. A flock of flamingos rose suddenly, flashing their gaudy feathers in a pink farewell as they departed. Across the lake a hippopotamus wore a crown of water lilies draped drunkenly over one eye and munched contentedly as a light breeze ruffled the lake water. I took a deep breath and saw, for just an instant, the Africa I had thought to find. Then, in a violent burst of crimson and gold, the sun shimmered hotly on the lake and was gone, sinking below the horizon, leaving only purple-blue shadows lengthening behind.\u201d(80)There are so many things I love about this book, but if I had to narrow it down to one, it would be the character Delilah. I found her anything BUT hard to love. She is decadent, confident, sexy, bold, and witty. She is vulnerable, caring, broken, and scarred. Deanna Raybourn did a wonderful job of constructing such a well-rounded, multi-layered heroine. As the crowning jewel, Delilah sits at the top of my list of favorite characters.Of course, I must say that my affection for Ryder also runs deep and strong. Raybourn first offered us a taste of this delicious character in the prequel enovella FAR IN THE WILDS. Whether or not you read it before A SPEAR OF SUMMER GRASS, rest assured, you will be left wanting more of Mr. J. Ryder White.Known for her Lady Julia Grey series (one of my favorites), Deanna Raybourn has raised the bar with this stand-alone -- which I desperately hope will become a series. No one brings words to life like Deanna does. Her novels are not the kind one simply reads, they are the kind one steps into and becomes a part of \u2013 breathing the same air as the characters. Reading A SPEAR OF SUMMER GRASS, I was transported by Raybourn\u2019s elegantly poetic prose. And if I look close enough, I just might see smudges of the red dust of Kenya on the pages of my copy.This is a thing that I know \u2013 Deanna Raybourn\u2019s talent is a true gift, to her and to readers."}, {"userName": "Christal", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1180557-christal", "userReview": "See this review and others like it at BadassBookReviews.com!In Deanna Raybourn's A Spear of Summer Grass, Delilah Drummond has found herself banished to Africa to avoid a scandal in France. Delilah is used to the posh, comfortable life and isn't sure what to expect from Africa. What she finds their test the limits of her strength and her heart.I'm a huge fan of Ms. Raybourn's \"Lady Julia\" novels and was expecting great things for this book. I have to say, I was very pleasantly satisfied. The story was fascinating; the characters were well-drawn and believable, and the descriptions of Africa were beautiful. I'm not sure if Ms. Raybourn intends to turn this into a series or not, aside from the upcoming prequel, but I would love to read more from these characters. Even though the book wrapped up nicely with no big threads left loose, I still have so many questions about what happens next for Delilah and Ryder.Speaking of Delilah, I think whether or not you enjoy this novel will depend mainly on if you find her likeable. She's spoiled and snotty and a bit of a bitch, but I have to say I loved that about her. She doesn't take crap from anyone, male or female, and values her worth as a capable and intelligent woman. Yes, she's a bit hard and condescending, but I think Ms. Raybourn set up a good backstory for her to be that way. She does thaw some as the book goes along and I think she would be a wonderful character to continue to watch grow.Ryder White is also a little rough around the edges, but he sees something in Delilah that calls to him. They both deny their attraction because they are scared of being hurt again. Ryder was completely swoon-worthy. He was strong; he was smart; he was good with his hands; he could hunt; he could cook, and he was drop dead gorgeous. No wonder he painted a swath through the women in the Kenyan community... he was irresistible. I am very excited to read his prequel next month and to learn more about his earlier life.The other supporting characters were also nicely done. Poor Dora, I do hope she will be at least a little bit happy now. She had to put up with a lot of crap as Delilah's cousin and caretaker and she was the one person that I wished Delilah had been a little bit nicer too. Tusker was also very interesting; I loved her story about the elephant even though it ended badly. Gideon was absolutely wonderful and gave the reader an exciting look into the life of a tribesman. Some characters that I really liked at the beginning showed their true colors by the end and it wasn't pretty. Overall, every character was entertaining and there are quite a few I would love to see again.When Delilah first leaves for Africa, she has romanticized it a bit based on her stepfather's travels. What she finds there is full of beauty, but it is also a much harder life than she expected. Living at Fairlight toughens her up a bit, but it also helps to break down the walls around her heart. The descriptions of the landscape and the animals were beautifully done and I felt like I could imagine everything around me. Ms. Raybourn described Africa as deadly, but full of beautiful and exciting aspects as well. Once you live there, nowhere else can satisfy you.A Spear of Summer Grass was an enchanting novel and I enjoyed everything about it. Delilah and Ryder were wonderful characters and their tentative love was a thing to see. Set against the lush African background, it made for a vivid and moving novel. I would expect nothing less from Deanna Raybourn!Thank you to Netgalley and Harlequin MIRA for providing an ARC copy of this book!"}, {"userName": "Ginevra", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13888083-ginevra", "userReview": "Questo libro mi ha attirata fin da subito, il titolo e la copertina sono stati come una calamita per me, pur non essendo un romanzo molto conosciuto! L'Africa, gli anni venti, la storia d'amore... Come si pu\u00f2 non amare una storia del genere?La protagonista \u00e8 Delilah Drummond; un personaggio che a me \u00e8 piaciuto moltissimo. Credo che o la sia ami o la si odi, con Delilah non ci sono vie di mezzo. A primo impatto pu\u00f2 sembrare una donna frivola che pensa solo ai vestiti, ai gioielli e al suo piacere personale, ma in fondo si nasconde una donna forte e determinata, con un cuore grande quanto tutta l'Africa, che farebbe di tutto non solo per le persone che le stanno a cuore, ma anche per chi ne ha pi\u00f9 bisogno. Secondo me Delilah \u00e8 tutto ci\u00f2 che una donna dovrebbe essere. Il protagonista maschile, invece, \u00e8 Ryder White. Anche lui \u00e8 un bel personaggio; forte e determinato, fa di tutto per ottenere ci\u00f2 che vuole. Non \u00e8 un personaggio che ti entra nel cuore, come tanti altri, per\u00f2, per questo libro, l'ho trovato perfetto. I personaggi non finiscono qui, ce ne sono tantissimi: Dora, la cugina inutile di Delilah che, per\u00f2, con il suo bigottismo riesce a strapparci un sorriso; gli altri espatriati inglesi (all'epoca il Kenya era una colonia inglese) che vivono tra lussi e agiatezze, in particolare Tusker \u00e8 quella che ho preferito; e poi c'\u00e8 Gideon che \u00e8 il personaggio che pi\u00f9 mi \u00e8 piaciuto di questo romanzo. Gideon \u00e8 un guerriero masai molto amico di Ryder e che, ben presto, si affezioner\u00e0 tanto a Delilah. Secondo me Gideon \u00e8 il perfetto esempio di genuinit\u00e0 e semplicit\u00e0; \u00e8 un personaggio che ti scalda il cuore e che ti fa riflettere su come si possa essere veramente felici pur avendo solo qualche mucca e nient'altro. Ed \u00e8 anche grazie a lui che scopriamo le tradizioni delle trib\u00f9 locali africane; dai Masai ai Kikuyu. Eh s\u00ec, perch\u00e9, tra tutti questi bizzarri personaggi, quello meglio costruito, quello che tocca cuore, anima e mente \u00e8 l'Africa. In questo romanzo l'Africa non \u00e8 solo l'ambientazione che fa da sfondo alle vicende dei protagonisti, ma \u00e8 parte integrante di quelle vicende; l'Africa ha vita propria e riesce ad entrarti dentro talmente bene che ti sembrer\u00e0 di essere in Kenya e di provare le stesse emozioni di Delilah.Questo grazie allo stile narrativo di Deanna Raybourn che con la sua scrittura semplice e scorrevole, piena di metafore, \u00e8 in grado, non solo di raccontare una bella storia d'amore, ma anche di evocare immagini e sensazioni vividissime nella mente del lettore. Descrive l'Africa, i suoi colori, i suoi odori, le sua tradizioni, i suoi popoli con una maestria tale da trasportarti in quel paese pur facendoti restare a chilometri di distanza. \"Africa, mon amour\" non \u00e8 soltanto una storia d'amore tra due persone, \u00e8 una storia d'amore tra la protagonista e quel continente selvaggio, sconfinato e meraviglioso che \u00e8 l'Africa. Il romanzo non \u00e8 affatto semplice e banale perch\u00e9, se riusciamo ad andare pi\u00f9 a fondo nella storia, ci accorgeremo che nasconde tanti insegnamenti e tante profonde verit\u00e0. Io ve lo consiglio con tutto il cuore. Dopo averlo letto farete fatica a trovare qualcosa da leggere perch\u00e9 il vostro cuore sar\u00e0 ancora legato a quelle pagine, ma fidatevi, ne vale assolutamente la pena!"}], "description": "Parigi, 1923.Figlia di una donna dalla vita decisamente vivace, Delilah Drummond non \u00e8 da meno ed \u00e8 ben nota nei circoli parigini per i suoi scandali.
