This time around, it feels more urban fantasy conspiracy theory than cozy mystery treasure hunting, and we get to meet more of the paranormal forces - good and bad. It also ties up one or two of the remaining loose ends from the earlier books. It'll be interesting to see where it goes next."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7736235-ashley", "userReview": "Best one yetThis is my favorite in this series by far, so much action & little, mysterious plot twists. Still a bit of mystery left for the last one though.

Dobbs but her real name {not sure if she writes under that one} is Lee Dobbins, Hazel Martin Mysteries only one I found for this type with her, she has not made sure that terms used match the British terms as well as in other areas for that period of architecture and assorted styles. The Notch Cozy Mystery Series {5 out as of this writing} and the Blackbore Sisters Cozy Mysteries are not on Kindle Unlimited which as said before about 1 & 7 {the only ones given free, sure would not have bought them} and ditto for Ghostly Paws which is 1 of 5 at this time but did get others free over time.While some of her other books are Kindle Unlimited none of the Blackmoore Sisters Cozy Mysteries are which doesn't matter to me as read #1 and #7 and was way underwhelmed. Leighann Dobbs writes under Leighann Dobbs, Annie Dobbs and (soon) L.A. Dobbs but her real name {not sure if she writes under that one} is Lee Dobbins, Hazel Martin Mysteries only one I found for this type with her, she has not made sure that terms used match the British terms as well as in other areas for that period of architecture and assorted styles. By the way, bakeries and other food service places don't run like that. Badly needs to proof things, it's messing up the flow of the book, which my computer reads to me, so that's bad. As for these, it's not that the situations couldn't happen, it's in the telling of the story, with unlikable unbelievable characters and situations, again.Yet another goodreads won't hide it don't want to see the badly proofed badly plotted poor excuse for bad soft core porn crap. The 'historical' ones are like that and so are the some of the non cozy mysteries and some of the sorta but not really mysteries because can't write, etc ad nauseum. The most any of them got was 2 changed to 1 for crap cozy, some get a 1 which means basically crappy soft porn 'romance' etc. 3 in Silver Hollow Paranormal Cozy Mystery Series so far which are on kindle unlimited, 3 in the Moosamuck Island Mysteries , 5 in the Mystic Notch Cozy Mysteries so far {not ku}, Blackmore Sisters has 7 {not ku}, Hazel Martin Mysteries only has 1 so far, Lexy Baker Cozy Mystery series 12 so far is on ku. Others.including Scandals and Spies Book series so far 4 which are basically romance soft core porn dreck but hey you can get them on ku. Witches of Hawthorne Grove 1 so far,Cevonne Bride of Oklahoma, Unexpected Series 4 so far ku.The Lexy Baker Cozy Mystery Series By the way, bakeries and other food service places don't run like that. Badly needs to proof things, it's messing up the flow of the book, which my computer reads to me, so that's bad. As for these, it's not that the situations couldn't happen, it's in the telling of the story, with unlikable unbelievable characters and situations, again.Copy/paste fill in the blank seems to be pretty much what she is doing in her books, which wouldn't be half as bad if the plots and ploys and actions were believable at all.Just change the name for a book and maybe change the series list under, and you are right back to copy paste same old same old.NOTE: I specifically mentioned certain of the 'books'/series were achieving soft core crap status, and specifically said which ones those were, reference AGAIN the above quoted review, and did not specifically mention the blackmore ones as that, BUT and had not mentioned that had went back and rated all no talent no plot cardboard charactered 'stories' listed above as 1 as well. I will change the original review to reflect that, but it is still a 1, and MY review of the crap stands."}, {"userName": "Gina Bowman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54838284-gina-bowman", "userReview": "This book was really good.

This book is told more from Jolene's point of view, I love that we get to see inside the heads of all the Blackmoore sisters through this series, you delve deeper into their characters with better understanding of them. This story has it all, Jolene is checking into her mother's suicide years ago plus working as a P.I. checking on a client. We have mysterious men popping up and an aunt that appears after being gone for many years. This book keeps moving and keeps you guessing as to what's coming next. Your probably wondering why I didn't give it 5 stars, it's a personal quirk with me but I don't get the secret keeping from the family, it bothers me and it is my quirk and shouldn't bother most because it does add to the mystery and you should not let my it stop you from reading this. I love the Blackmoore sisters and their growing group with their love interests, and will be continuing on with this series, I can't wait to see what comes next."}, {"userName": "moxieBK", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26133856-moxiebk", "userReview": "#5 in Blackmore Sisters Mystery.The Blackmore Sisters and their cat are back! This series has gotten better with each book. The author has slowed her zeal with pairing the sisters off, and concentrated more on the plot and that's A-OK with me! I really liked this story. The paranormal part and the comedy, and just the relationship between the sisters--it's all heartwarming and a nice, relaxing, quick read. This is the kind of story I like to read when I want to be put in a happy place, with a smile on my face. All around enjoyable. I hope Ms. Dobbs continues this series/story, because it's so fun to read. I look forward to more adventures with these sisters.

These five novels were fun to read, and a quick read.
