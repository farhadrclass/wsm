If it's a tome it is gigantic by its very definition, or are you saying that it's especially large, even for a tome?Alright, so when I was considering writing a review of this tome, I made a promise to myself not to use the word epic.Newsflash, genius, you are writing a review and you just used the word epic. Mission failed, promise to self broken (you suck). ... Anyway, I did not want to use the word epic to describe this novel, but I realized that there isn't another word that would describe it adequately. Oh look, I have a thesaurus. Check it out: Inflated, grandiose, gargantuan, monumental, towering, gigantic, Brobdingnagian ... Sooo, this is a big book and if you're not interested in South African history, it might not be something you want to read. Durrr, hey I'm not interested in reading about South African history, I think I'll read this monstrous (thank you, thesaurus) Michener book that focuses entirely on South Africa. IS ANYONE THAT STUPID? Yes, as a matter of fact ...But do you think that anyone reading your review is that stupid?Of course not, they're obviously individuals of highly evolved taste and intelligence. I just thought that maybe they don't know what the book is about.Do you honestly believe that someone interested in this book went to YOUR review first?

In my opinion, this is Michener's best.Have you read every Michener book?No.Then how can you say that? What if his best book is \"Mexico\"? It isn't.Listen, you lumpy-headed simpleton, can you guarantee beyond all doubt that one of the many Michener books that you haven't read isn't his best?No, but ...Then your opinion isn't worth much, is it?Fine. I just thought this was a really good book and, having read a sizable selection of Michener's works, I have a hard time imagining a better one.Oh, so we're to be held hostage, as review readers, by the limits of your poverty-stricken imagination? Fine. This is an excellent book, that's all I'm saying.I think what the reviewer is trying to say, for any readers who have made it this far, is that you should probably read another review if you want any actual meaningful analysis of this bookShut up."}, {"userName": "Allison Corin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1417372-allison-corin", "userReview": "This is a difficult book to review. As with all Michener books, it is well researched and written. Anytime I recommend one of his books, I must verify that the intended reader loves history, loves reading, and is willing to hunker down and delve through slow stories to enjoy the incredible wealth of knowledge that can be gained from his stories. The covenant is no different. To read this story takes a level of patience and desire that most books, even most historical novels, do not require. That being said, of all the Michener books I have read, I think this may be his finest, especially in terms of how he describes the mindset and motivations of the various groups. Many of the characters are so unlikable or belligerent that you want to shake some 21st century sense into them, but that's easy to say from my couch in Miami. This is certainly a study on how NOT to develop and run a diverse, fair society, but that's kind of the point. It really is too bad that we don't get to see this story through to the end of apartheid; however, if this had been written in 2014 there would undoubtably be future history that readers a hundred years from now would lament not being being included."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Dunsky", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12645164-jonathan-dunsky", "userReview": "James Michener's epic book on South-Africa. It tells the story of that land from the early settlements by the Dutch, through the expansion of it by English immigrants and others, to the South-Africa of the Apartheid age, shortly before it was eliminated.The tumultuous and violent history of South-Africe is told with Michener's careful research and adherence to detail. The people and their struggles and the values that drove them enrich the story and add the personal touch to the sweeping changes around them.It is a tragic story of slavery, struggles against elements, racism, war, and love. There are many characters in this novel, as it spans hundreds of years.You will read about Cecil Rhodes, the rise of the Zulu Empire, the Boer wars and the concentration camps that the British erected during that war.It also provides a good look at the evil of Apartheid, how it was established, and how many whites in the country knew it could not last.As with many Michener books, you learn something as you enjoy the great story.

By 1860, with slavery having been abolished in 1834, and after the annexation of Natal as a British colony in 1843, the British colonialists in Natal (now kwaZulu-Natal) turned to India to resolve a labour shortage. Men of the local Zulu warrior nation were refusing to adopt the servile position of labourers. In that year, the SS Truro arrived in Durban harbour with over 300 Indians on board. Over the next 50 years, 150,000 more indentured Indian servants and labourers arrived, as well as numerous free \"passenger Indians\", building the base for what would become the largest Indian community outside India. By 1893, when the lawyer and social activist Mahatma Gandhi arrived in Durban, Indians outnumbered whites in Natal. The civil rights struggle of Gandhi's Natal Indian Congress failed; until the 1994 advent of democracy, Indians in South Africa were subject to most of the discriminatory laws that applied to all non-white inhabitants of the country.

As of 2009 we can now look back at what happened to South Africa and it is wonderful to see that of the 2 scenario's that Michener thought most likely the (relatively) bloodless one emerged. I especially enjoyed his section on South Africa under apartheid. It is a reminder to me of how stupid, brutal and ineffective it was a system. The whites now like to complain about Affirmative Action and BEE but looking at the system that we put the blacks under it is enough to make us ashamed. That is not to say that we shouldn't strive to make South Africa a better place for all, we should just realise where our young democracy comes from and gasp in horror and what we did menatlly, physically to the majority of our population. Not to say the least about our education and skills development of the black population. What a disgrace! One should read this book just to see what a frace Apartheid was..The book as a whole kind of rambled on through 1000 pages of the history of South Africa. I obviously was interested in the subject matter, but on the whole the book is not that exciting.

I wish my school history books had been written like this, with the insertion of fictional characters to bring story and life into what is normally a dull narrative.After a preface on the early Bushman who inhabited the land since pre-historic times, the story follows the lineage of the Afrikaner Van Doorn, English Saltwood and Zulu Nxumalo families, from the arrival of the first Europeans in the mid 17th century to the end of the 1970\u2019s. Dominant members of each of these families shape and are shaped by the history of the country. There are dozens of stories within this book, tragic, dramatic, humorous and downright inhuman, all extremely interesting and well rendered. The intent of the novel in its 1100 pages seems to be to capture the history South Africa and therefore we see characters enter and exit quickly along with their stories, with only a few like Tjaart and Detleef Van Doorn, Hillary and Laura Saltwood, Jonathan and Daniel Nxumalo and the timeless General Paulus De Groot leaving larger footprints than their relatives.The clash of white and black cultures is evident from the beginning when the Europeans land in Cape Town in the mid 17th century and migrate north as far as the boundary with Zimbabwe over generations, while the blacks in the form of the resident Hottentots, the Xhosa from across the Great Fish River, and their northern Zulu cousins separated by the Drakensburg range, all drift south seeking boundless grazing land for their herds. The Dutch Afrikaner and his nomadic cousin, the Boer, are portrayed as fierce, independent individuals, willing to fight against insurmountable odds, who in their Calvinistic faith believe that this land was given to them, by God\u2019s covenant and that like the different colours of jelly, the various colours of race shouldn\u2019t mix. The English, who arrive in 1805, are more interested in empire and the abolition of slavery, while the blacks simply want their land back, and the Coloureds reflect the sin of miscegenation. Mixed in with the fictional characters are real life individuals, three in particular: Shaka of the Zulu, Cecil Rhodes and Lord Kichener, men who never married, wreak havoc in the country in their misguided intention of maintaining order.Loyalties shift between the ethnic groups during each generation as they jockey for pole position. There is even a time when the Afrikaners throw in their lot with the Germans during the two world wars of the 20th century to be rid of the British, while the Xhosa starve themselves to death under the illusion that the Russians are coming to their aid after the Crimean War. The British are no better and open concentration camps at the end of the Boer War where many women and children die of typhoid, dysentery and other diseases.All this evolution only leads to South Africa\u2019s darkest phase, when the Afrikaner Nationalist Party gains control in 1948 and institutes a form of Nazism called Apartheid. Horrible things happen during this time: whites have to carry Life Books with them detailing every incident in their life to protect their racial purity, Coloureds are to be deprived of their vote, blacks are given \u201cBantustans\u201d (segregated homelands), transgressors of any colour are \u201cbanned\u201d from public life indefinitely, and suspicion rules the land \u2013 for instance, the lack of freckles could imply that you are Coloured. The irony is that when racial investigations are initiated, even the \u201cpurest of the pure\u201d are found to have some miscegenation somewhere up their family tree, making the whole issue of racial purity, in a land where early European male settlers could not find wives easily, a bit of a joke. It\u2019s a pity that Michener ends his narrative in 1979, with Apartheid at its worst, with scores of the best and brightest fleeing the country for places like Canada and Australia, with blacks massing for revolution over in Mozambique, and with 400 years of evolution leading the country only to its worst boiling point. God\u2019s Covenant, indeed - Calvin would be turning in his grave!We all know that Apartheid ended in the 1990\u2019s and South Africa still lurches trying to find its feet under its new balance of power, and therefore this story has no ending, yet. Michener shows hope however, when he parallels Phillip Saltwood\u2019s tireless search for diamonds, which finally yields the possibility of a find, to the search for peace in the land by its various leaders who are mining for diamonds in their fellow citizens\u2019 souls.As for the fate of the panoramic novel, I think it has less hope than South Africa has, given the shrinking of attention spans these days. I took nearly a month to finish this book, engrossing though it was, and am unlikely to pick up another Michener tome for a long time to come. Mich would have to drastically alter his writing strategy were he still alive today."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5349403-carolyn", "userReview": "4.5 stars When I realized this was a formidable book of almost 1200 pages I postponed reading it for several weeks. Once I started it I was fascinated by the brutal and bloody history of this beautiful country.The story is told through the lives, actions and beliefs of three extended, multigeneration families,( fictional but with some actual events) and gave me more insight as to how the reviled system of apartheid came to be. There is an Afrikaaner family (an amalgamation of mainly Dutch, Huguenot and German),an English family and a Zulu family whose history is told from their beginnings in South Africa. We also learn of the fate of the Xhosa tribe, indigenous people such as the San (Bushman) and Hottentots.  Fanatical and firmly held religous beliefs considered the Blacks inferior in ability, fit only as servants or for menial labour by the Whites.The Coloured (people of mixed race)were considered tainted by the sexual sins of their ancestors and were confined to certain jobs and separate living areas. Blacks saw their homes bulldozed and sent to segregated areas. Chinese were brought in as cheap labour, and then expelled. Indians were also considered beneath the white settlers, and limited in where they lived and what they achieved. Gandhi shows up as a stretcher bearer during the Boer War. The Afrikaaners mostly believed they had a covenant with God to rule this country and their religious beliefs gave them the right to subject and enslave people they considered inferior. The English wanted South Africa as part of the British Empire, and bloody wars were fought with heroic actions on both sides. Sometimes their native servants accompanied them into battle fields, and there were also wars with the Zulus. The thoughts and actions of the books charscters gave me better insight into this gorgeous, troubled country, more than history books could convey. Some of the fictional characters are based on real people and events. Throughout the book we also read about real historical characters. It added to my enjoyment to look up their photos and biographies on the internet, and also pictures and maps of the places mentioned. The book was published in 1979 when apartheid was in force, positions of wealth and power were confined to the whites, other people were defranchised, Blacks were seeing their homes bulldozed and being sent to hovels outside the city, anyone of any race considered an agitator could be banned or imprisoned and/or tortured. I wish there had been an addition to the book for the rapid events which occured in starting with President de Klerk negotiating with Mandela while he was imprisoned in 1990, the dismantling of apartheid, and universal voting rights, the release of Mandela from prison and his ascent to the Presidency. Would have liked to know how the book's characters thought and reacted to these changes in the structure of their society. At the end of the book it was suggested that it would take much time and patience and maybe a war for these changes to take place, and maybe their grandchildren would live to see what actually happened within 14 years of the publication of the Covenant."}, {"userName": "Christine Ward", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2381682-christine-ward", "userReview": "The last time I read this book was about six years ago, and I remember thinking that Michener was overly sympathetic to the Afrikaners, and thus, to their cause - apartheid. Finding that morally repugnant, I decided I was done with this book and done with Michener. Currently, I'm experiencing a Michener-revival, and after watching \"Invictus\", thought I'd give this book another try. Like all Michener books, this is incredibly well-researched, and very involved, with characters that span hundreds of years. Some of those characters' descendants will turn up in the story later on; others do not. However, like most Michener books I've read, this is also a fascinating read - and, as I discovered this round, not necessarily sympathetic to the Afrikaners and their cause.I think Michener demonstrates sympathies to all groups he writes about, and this book is no exception. It is true that much of this book is devoted to Afrikaner families, but that is to be expected of a book about South Africa. The reader should also take into consideration that this was written in 1979, and even if some characters espouse repugnant views, those are not necessarily the views of the author.I don't think this is Michener's best novel - I'd say Hawaii, followed closely by The Source - are his best works, but this is certainly a book worth reading.I'm glad I re-read this.

My dad gave me this book before I left the U.S. to study in South Africa. I got a third of the way through before finally giving up. I love to read and rarely stop reading in the middle, but I found it very difficult to commit to The Covenant. The history is interesting and useful and has been a good companion to my travels in this country, but ultimately the characters are one-dimensional, and the stories seem forced, rather than developing in an organic way. The author seemed more interested in writing a history textbook than a novel, and only took a cursory stab at describing the characters making their ways through their social spheres. At no point did I emphasize with any character; instead I was forced by Michener to view them from a distance, which I think diffuses his whole purpose of making history accessible and immediate to a large audience.

The First Anglo-Boer War (1880\u20131881), was a rebellion of Boers (farmers) against British rule in the Transvaal that re-established their independence. The Second War (1899\u20131902), by contrast, was a lengthy war\u2014involving large numbers of troops from many British possessions, which ended with the conversion of the Boer republics into British colonies (with a promise of limited self-governance). These colonies later formed part of the Union of South Africa During the later stages of the Second Boer War, the British pursued the policy of rounding up and isolating the Boer civilian population in concentration camps, one of the earliest uses of this method by modern powers. The wives and children of Boer guerrillas were sent to these camps, which had poor hygiene and little food. Many of the children in these camps died, as did some of the adults.Anglo-Boer war-1899.

He was the first black South African to hold the office, and the first elected in a fully representative, multiracial election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid through tackling institutionalised racism, poverty and inequality, and fostering racial reconciliation. A Xhosa born to the Thembu royal family, Mandela attended Fort Hare University and the University of Witwatersrand, where he studied law. After the Afrikaner nationalists of the National Party came to power in 1948 and began implementing the policy of apartheid, he rose to prominence. Working as a lawyer, he was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and, with the ANC leadership, was prosecuted in the Treason Trial from 1956 to 1961 but was found not guilty. Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the South African Communist Party he lead a bombing campaign against government targets. In 1962 he was arrested, convicted of sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government, and sentenced to life imprisonment.Mandela served 27 years in prison, first on Robben Island, and later in Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. An international campaign lobbied for his release, which was granted in 1990 amid escalating civil strife. Becoming ANC President, Mandela published his autobiography and led negotiations with President F.W. de Klerk to abolish apartheid and establish multiracial elections in 1994, in which he led the ANC to victory. He was elected President and formed a Government of National Unity in an attempt to defuse ethnic tensions. As President, he established a new constitution and initiated the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Continuing the former government's liberal economic policy, his administration introduced measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator between Libya and the United Kingdom in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial, and oversaw military intervention in Lesotho. He declined to run for a second term, and was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela subsequently became an elder statesman, focusing on charitable work in combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the Nelson Mandela Foundation.Mandela has been a controversial figure for much of his life. Right-wing critics denounced him as a terrorist and communist sympathiser. He nevertheless gained international acclaim for his anti-colonial and anti-apartheid stance, having received more than 250 honours, including the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize, the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Soviet Order of Lenin. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name, Madiba, or as Tata (\"Father\"); he is often described as \"the father of the nation\".Mandela has been married three times, has fathered six children, has 17 grandchildren and a growing number of great-grandchildren.Mandela's first marriage was to Evelyn Ntoko Mase, in October 1944.[54] The couple broke up in 1957 after 13 years, divorcing under the multiple strains of his adultery and constant absences, devotion to revolutionary agitation, and the fact that she was a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses, a religion requiring political neutrality.The couple had two sons, Madiba \"Thembi\" Thembekile (1946\u20131969) and Makgatho Mandela (1950\u20132005), and two daughters, both named Makaziwe Mandela (known as Maki; born 1947 and 1953). Their first daughter died aged nine months, and they named their second daughter in her honour.[citation needed] Mase died in 2004, and Mandela attended her funeral. Makgatho's son, Mandla Mandela, became chief of the Mvezo tribal council in 2007.Mandela's second wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. She was the city's first black social worker.They had two daughters, Zenani (Zeni), born 4 February 1958, and Zindziswa (Zindzi) Mandela-Hlongwane, born 1960.

Michener - for the second time. Maybe third? Certainly the last time I read it was many, many years ago. I have to be completely honest - I didn't finish it. Skimmed to the end. The despicable characters in the last three chapters and the origins of their racism - the stripping open of South African's racist past -- were blunt and horrible. What ugly people. I needed some heroes, and these people weren't it. Small and ugly. Luckily, I have the advantage of knowing their future -- they don't win. Although I kept thinking that the blacks in South Africa taking back their country from the whites was kin to American Indians taking back the United States. The US and South Africa were settled at approximately the same time. Origin of species and constant contact with outsiders made blacks in Africa less susceptible to European disease than their New World counterparts, I imagine. Michener also did a whizzbang job fictionally painting why the New World developed one way and South Africa went another way. Certainly not my favorite Michener.All historical epics again have to end, and in my mind Poland and The Covenant end the bleakest but the actual futures are the brightest."}, {"userName": "Dale", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4696608-dale", "userReview": "Michener's take on South AfricaMichener's true epics are always worth the time to read. \nThe Covenant\n is no exception. Michener's take on South Africa and its history is an honest attempt to give some perspective on one of the more complex histories that this history teacher has encountered.The book starts out strong (my edition was the two-volume hardback). The first volume was vintage Michener, but the second one dragged. Perhaps it was because the subject matter became more and more depressing. With the final 200 pages or so being about Apartheid, it's hard to find something to cheer about.In a way, Michener's book seems incomplete - he hints that Apartheid could no longer stand - he gives a prediction that it would end by about the year 2000. Turns out, he was just about right, but the book feels like it does not have a proper ending.If you are pondering a Michener book and have not read them all (personally, I only have one more of his major books to go) than I recommend skipping this one and coming back to it later.http://dwdsreviews.blogspot.com/2011/..."}, {"userName": "Augusto Bernardi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25594766-augusto-bernardi", "userReview": "Great summary of the history of South Africa. It's a learning experience and wish I had read James A. Michener's books in high school history class. One thing that particularly stood out for me was that the truly violent and horrific events in the book weren't from the people I thought they were gonna be from. WE forget some parts of history sometimes. Having said all that though, I did not like that you could not connect with ANY characters in the book. By the end of the chapter, the character that you were reading about is dead. Not by anything related to the plot but just of natural causes. The time span in this book is over 500 years so it was more of a lecture and less of a story. There were MANY little great mini stories and some characters I would have liked to read an entire story about, but that wasn't the case. This distances you from the characters and makes the story sort of dull."}, {"userName": "Daniel Villines", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2266055-daniel-villines", "userReview": "An understatement of the truth would be to say that reading Michener is an investment in time.
