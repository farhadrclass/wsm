He doesn't mind spending the holiday alone; in fact, he prefers it. Harry is a loner who identifies with a solitary coyote that hangs out near his house.Harry's evening is interrupted when he picks up chatter on the police scanner regarding a suspicious death in a down-at-the-heels Hollywood motel. It's clear from the scanner that department brass are assembling at the scene and Harry can't help but wonder what in the hell is going on. He's on call and should have been the first one notified of the death. He calls in only to discover that the brass are taking control of the situation and that he is supposed to stay well away.Fat chance. Harry goes to the scene and discovers that the body is that of a missing narcotics cop, Calexico Moore, who may have gone over to the dark side. It appears that Moore has committed suicide in the bathroom of the seedy motel. It's also clear that the brass want to close the case ASAP, sweep the bad news under the rug, and limit any damage to the department's reputation.Harry is specifically ordered to stay well away from the case, and shortly thereafter his boss assigns him a pile of homicide cases that belonged to a useless detective who has suddenly quit the department. Harry's boss is anxious to see an improvement in the unit's clearance rate by the end of the year, which is only a week away. He begs Harry to pick through the cases in an effort to solve the easiest one or two of them in time to sweeten up the stat sheet.Reluctantly, Harry begins digging into the cases only to find one homicide that crosses the trail of Calexico Moore, the dead narcotics detective. Even though he's been instructed to stay clear of the Moore case, Harry begins digging into the ties that seem to link the two cases. In the process, he will stumble into a web of intrigue and will also mightily antagonize his superiors. But Harry Bosch serves justice first, and has absolutely no time or respect for a bunch of self-serving bureaucrats. Harry will follow the trail wherever it leads no matter the dangers to his career or to his personal safety. It's a great ride with lots of surprising twists and turns, a novel that will appeal to a large number of crime fiction fans and that will also further establish the reputation of this series as the best police procedural series of the modern era."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52374080-mark", "userReview": "The Black Ice is the second book in Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series.Harry Bosch - An L.A detective who is like a more modern version of Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry. He is abrasive, doesn't play by the rules, sets his own agendas and gets the job done!Black Ice - a derivative of the drug Ice. Manufactured in Mexico it is Ice with heroin added to give an extra kick. The Mexicans add this to make it more potent than standard Ice thus making it more attractive to users and therefore out selling Ice that is manufactured and smuggled from Hawaii. Added to this is their advantage of being able to bring it across the land border into the U.S.A easier than by plane or sea from Hawaii. The drug is particularly nasty and often lethal as the grime and remnants are scraped from the bottom of the barrel in a heroin cook and added here to waste nothing. It is this addition that turns the drug black and gives it the name, Black Ice.No longer part of the DEA, Harry has yet another department in law enforcement to beat heads with. When one of his previous colleagues turns up dead by apparent suicide and yet another takes sudden permanent leave over the Christmas period, Harry finds his caseload increases dramatically. The bosses are after statistics, one of the things that grates on Harry more than anything, and they want him to clear a case or two to bring the statistics into the positive.The cases Harry has inherited were poorly managed so Harry thinks with a little effort some can be solved easily. Digging around he finds these cases lead directly to the suicide of his old partner and a Mexican drug cartel manufacturing Black Ice.As is Harry's way he rubs the bosses up the wrong way, chases his instincts and has a couple of inappropriate relationships too. With no support from the department Harry goes it alone - something he much prefers and creates a storm of trouble.GO AHEAD HARRY, make my day!!"}, {"userName": "John Culuris", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55859990-john-culuris", "userReview": "Most forms of entertainment come with the expectation that the follow-up to well-received debut will invariably fail to reach the same level of quality. Lack of time is almost always the reason. Take television for example. The first episode of a series is often the pilot; when it gets picked up there is rush to get production up and running and traditionally it is the second episode that most displays the signs of \u201cjust get it out.\u201d With movies, an unexpected hit receives a release date for the sequel while the creators are just beginning to organize the logistics. Musicians and comedians are not immune. While honing their craft in the clubs, they create a great reservoir of materiel to draw upon for their first CD or TV special. Once it is released, though, for the most part they have to crate their sophomore effort from scratch, often under the pressure of expectations and, of course, a deadline. (Although, honestly, I\u2019m not sure how the advent of YouTube has affected the dynamic regarding musicians.)With literature the disparity is not as great. The second novel receives skills and attention that can only be acquired by completing that first manuscript, but this is often offset by a well-thought-out story and the fifteen thousand polishes the first effort is given. And again time enters the picture. Unless the writer is a celebrity, who presumably brings with him a built-in following--and since instant bestseller status is too rare to be counted on--publishers want to build an author\u2019s audience with successive offerings. That second book comes with a deadline. Often it is the third book--with the deadline experience now added to the writer\u2019s toolset--that gives us an accurate reflection of who the author is to be. With Black Ice, Michael Connelly\u2019s second outing, I got what I expected.When a week-old suicide is discovered at a rundown cheap motel, an Assistant Chief of the LAPD takes over the case even before Harry Bosch, the detective on call, can be notified. This immediately tells the entire precinct that the victim is Calexico Moore, a member of the division\u2019s undercover drug unit who had been missing for about the same amount of time. Because Moore was suspected of being dirty, the higher-ups are happy to call it suicide and close the books. Harry is not as sure, but with little access to the case there is not a lot he can do. Back to his assigned work, soon another case intersects with Moore\u2019s orbit. And then a file--back in 1993 this meant a folder containing actually papers--is relayed to Bosch from the deceased, a man with whom Harry had only once before had an interaction of any substance. Detectives do not believe in coincidence. Neither do readers of detective novels. Harry Bosch and Michael Connelly set about explaining them, most during the natural course of the investigation, all by the conclusion.In his second outing Harry Bosch seems a little less rough around the edges. He is no longer rude to people trying to help him. He genuinely regrets lying to a man who enthusiastically assists him in his research. And while Bosch will still take advantage of any relationship that will aid his cause, he also pays back that help when he gets the opportunity. I believe this to more the evolution of the author than that of the character. Connelly has learned how to preserve Bosch\u2019s loner status without causing reader to wonder how this man could possibly have any real friends. The Harry Bosch in this book would still never be the first invited to a party, absolutely true, but neither would people pretend every seat is taken to prevent him joining their table.Black Ice is not a perfect novel. After an intriguing start Connelly makes the ensuing complications too intricate and too compact in too short a period of time. And the final confrontation does not play as smoothly as one would hope (i.e. too much explanation). The rest is high-quality, vintage Connelly. That\u2019s correct, two novels in and there is a \u201cvintage\u201d Connelly. I believe in the rule cited above: if the first is great, the second will drop off and the third will steady up and begin trending toward the quality of the first--and hopefully beyond. I came to this book with great anticipation precisely because it was Connelly\u2019s second outing. Now I\u2019m really looking forward to #3, The Concrete Blonde.\nFAIR WARNING: There are graphic descriptions of a bull fight that may prove disturbing to some."}, {"userName": "Carol.

I ended up rather pleased with result, at least until the Mexican vacation. While there are moments that feel somewhat formulaic, Connelly puts enough flavor into it that I enjoyed the result.Harry is spending Christmas alone and on-call, peaceably listening to the scanner as he makes his dinner. He hears a call go out for a homicide detective in his district and is surprised when his pager doesn't go off. It turns out to be the body of a missing vice cop, Cal Moore. Harry had recently met with Cal looking for more information on a dead body carrying concealed bags of the newest street drug, Black Ice. Cal mentioned something about an internal investigation launched against him, had recently separated from his wife and had been by all accounts, working on a serious case of liver cirrhosis. Harry invites himself to the death scene, smooth talks his way in and promptly discovers enough to build suspicion that this is a murder, not a suicide. In about two minutes, Harry is warned off the case by both Internal Affairs and his boss, so of course, he's even more suspicious. To keep Harry busy, his boss hands him all the open cases for a co-worker who's decided to go off on disability due to booze. Instead of distracting him, they seem to lead him back to Cal.Alright, so that's enough of a summary to help me remember which one it is, because with a current twenty-one books in the Bosch series, it's going to be easy for both me and Connelly to get them a little confused. Despite a number of standard noir elements (see Kemper's hilarious review for The Black Echo), it felt engaging. Until the case leads Harry down to the border (now that I think about it, it must be pre-wall), when Connelly tries to pad his story with red herrings and conspiracies. Writing has definitely improved, but Connelly keeps Harry flat enough that the reader can't tell exactly what he is thinking. Is Harry suspicious of that official? Why does he seemingly trust that one, or is he keeping him close as a potential suspect? It means the mystery isn't allowed to grow naturally; instead, it's like being in the fog and having it suddenly lift. It's the difference between a dim room and sleight-of-hand.But the good news is that I feel quite mentally stocked up on police detective type mysteries (except that most entertaining Peter Grant. I'll make space for him any day).

Michael Connelly\u2019s recurring tough guy, Vietnam veteran Los Angeles police detective is the kind of murder mystery protagonist a seasoned reader of the genre can get behind. Surly and reclusive, a loner more than a team player, Bosch provides a modern variation of the noir crime fiction sleuth.Connelly\u2019s 1993 thriller takes Bosch to the Mexican border towns of Calexico and Mexicali to investigate what begins as a suspicious cop\u2019s suicide that develops into much, much more.

Officer Cal was NOT murdered in the hotel room as everyone thought, and that he had murdered Zorrillo, staged the whole thing to look like Cal was the victim, and took Zorrillo's place, with the intention of racking up a ton of cash and then disappearing. So, at the end, he finds Cal, confronts him, and ends up shooting him with a shotgun, which, conveniently, hits him square in the face - the same as Zorrillo's murder. Now my problem isn't with the shooting. In all likelihood, Cal was about to try to kill Bosch - it wouldn't be the first cop he'd killed, so why expect less? My problem is with Bosch... just leaving him there to rot. His face was blasted away, so IDing him, especially in Mexico, probably wouldn't have been easy - considering that Zorrillo was in cohoots with the local police chief and would probably NOT have prints or records on file. Bosch could have claimed to track him down, or even that \"Zorrillo\" had tracked HIM down (he'd already had one attempt on his life, so it would make sense that he would want to get rid of a threat for good), hand over the body, and let the DEA close out the case on Zorrillo. I have no doubt that he could have made it work. He's done more with less already in the series. Instead, he left the body in a place that nobody would think to look, because it has no ties to Zorrillo, with a bag full of drug money, in the hopes that if someone does find the body, they'll take the money and skedaddle, rather than report it. Meanwhile, the DEA is ramping up their manhunt efforts to find this supposedly on-the-run drug lord-slash-cop killer.

Ethical lines keep moving in the wrong direction and he's not in that club. Despite obstacles presented by his own department, Harry pursues this case involving a murdered cop when others were ready to classify it as a suicide. He's got great instincts and needed all of them with this one as the bad guys weren't always outside of law enforcement. We also learn a lot about Harry's background, providing some key insights about this enigmatic detective. I've got to admit I'm starting to fall for him and I don't see that changing. He's smart, principled and oh so flawed with just a touch of tortured hero. Audio reviewDick Hill's interpretation of Harry is dead on. You can hear the smirk in his voice, his cadence and timing utterly perfect. Even if I read any of the other books in the series (I don't plan to), I'd still hear his voice as Harry. The bottom lineHarry Bosch is a NY style detective toughing it out in the Hollywood precinct of the LAPD because he won't play politics. The series is edgy, unpredictable and interesting. This one topped it off with a real surprising twist, too. I wasn't expecting a halo of romance with these stories but I'm getting it from this man.

Since I don't reveal plots and reserve my comments to the overall book/author, characterization, style, etc...I just don't feel the need to repeat myself as in most cases  series books if any good at all do remain consistent. The star ratings might change, but not my opinion of the series as a whole.Michael Connelly is a well know and very popular author in the mystery/detective and police procedural genres. Exploding onto the scene in the early nineties with his first six novels, and topping it off just recently with his 18th Bosch novel (The Black Box), Connelly has garnered most awards worth getting. Let's face it, the awards are well deserved, especially for those first novels (more on that later). Having emerged onto the fictional world after a career as a journalist, culminating with his job as crime reporter for the LA times, and admitting to becoming interested in writing fiction as a result of reading Raymond Chandler early on in his journalistic career, Michael Connelly has since involved himself in several collaborations: notable the television series Level 9, and as co-writer with Val McDermid's Wire In the Blood series (and that spawned the wildly popular grim, noir BBC television series of the same name). If you're into Noir than this TV series is a must see.Connelly has a knack for writing suspenseful tales that take quite a few twists and turns before being resolved with a stellar Who-Done-It that has most readers guessing till the very end (at least in his earlier books).Heironymous (Harry) Bosch, the hero in this series, is named after a Renaissance painter who specialized in earthly sins, debauchery, fanciful and gruesome visions of hell, violent consequences from high above if not detailed looks at the tortures reserved for earthly residents. Score 1 for Connelly in choosing a very apropos name for our own tortured detective Harry Bosch.Bosch is a complicated and conflicted character, a character that slowly develops across this series but whose emotive origin lies in the Viet Cong tunnels where Harry got his education in fear: underground, claustrophic, dark, drenched with blood, gruesome deaths, peopled with a savage enemy crawling within the absence of all light, hunting for the American soldiers like bloodthirsty rats. From these dark tunnels emerges Harry Bosch, LAPD detective, bent on setting the world right. From this darkness where pacific military command has sent Bosch to discover the inevitable conflict between a military order and the reality of carrying out that order, we find a detective in perpetual defiance of LAPD authority.The Harry Bosch series, for me, are divided into two sets: the first 4 books, and the rest that follow. As mentioned earlier, the classic early 90's novels were better for me. Books starting with The Black Echo on through The Last Coyote all inherit the tortuous origins of Harry's artistic namesake. Reading these books I could actually feel my heart begin to race as I sped towards the inevitable ending, ones that actually kept you guessing to the very end. One reviewer (sorry, can't remember who it was) says the following of these earlier book titles:[...]Even the titles of the books used to be cleverer. Compare The Drop (a simple reference to Deferred Retirement Option Plan) to The Concrete Blonde (a reference to both lady justice statue on the courthouse and the body of a blonde entombed in concrete. [...]Compare that to the later books in the series where we find a Harry Bosch notably mellower in his older age, where we find endings easily guessed at, where procedure begins to trump a superb plot. Bosch no longer smokes, doesn't drink and drive, doesn't slap people around anymore, where his defiance of LAPD authority is tempered by retirement, and let's face it, where my heart just doesn't race as often anymore. Let's say that his later novels are beginning to show an author's haste (is it me, or are the novels shorter and shorter?)Don't get me wrong, I still love reading the latest Bosch novel. Where the earlier novels have a few things that can be improved on (dialogue could have been better) the later novels are polished, almost a little too much so. After 18 Bosch novels, is Connelly tiring? Maybe.Beginning with the last 90's novel (Angels Flight) in which we are introduced to Bosch's latest romantic interest, Eleanor Wish, with whom Bosch is to have a daughter this mellowing process takes root. Connelly is absolutely right to introduce this notable character shift in Bosch from this book forward because as I can attest to in my own personal life: when you see your child born, a fundamental shift takes place in a man. For me, I was reborn from a devilish bachelor into a man who now bore the responsibility of an innocent life. It completely turned around my life for the better. And so it is with Harry Bosch. It is the presence of his daughter that transforms him from Heironymous to Harry.Overall, I highly recommend this series."}, {"userName": "Kate~Bibliophile Book Club", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9841866-kate-bibliophile-book-club", "userReview": "Last year I decided I was going to re-read the Harry Bosch series in order (at my own pace), and The Black Ice is the second one from my list.

It has a great story, introduces some great characters and it kept my attention from the very beginning. A body is found in a LA motel room, and it transpires it\u2019s a missing LAPD Narcotics Detective. Rumours were rife that he had crossed over to the dark side, and death was quickly declare a suicide. But Harry has other ideas about it.Things don\u2019t add up for Harry. Unanswered questions about the crime scene, about the cop before he died and the people he was keeping company with lead Harry off on his own investigation. Harry ends up going across the border, but he finds far more than he bargained for while he is assessing the situation.Corruption, drugs and police politics are all called into play in The Black Ice.

Even when Harry finds himself in danger, he doesn\u2019t give up.I love this series, and the re-reading in order is definitely the best decision. Early Harry is so great to read about. He is without a doubt one of my favourite characters in fiction, EVER. Michael Connelly is such a brilliant writer too. His years as a police reporter are clearly evident in his writing.

The story in The Black Ice screams mediocre and it does the reader no good when the author writes at such a snail pace. There is literally nothing going action wise even when you're 3/4 into the book. The end does get a bit intense but by that time, you're probably too exhausted to care anymore about what happens and just wish the story would end. That is never good for any book when you just want it to end so bad. At the core, The Black Ice is another classic whodunnit mystery but something just felt missing here. It seems as if you don't care for the characters at all and that even at times apply to our main detective, Harry Bosch.I really wanted to like this book but I'm not going to lie to myself. Although I don't hate it particularly, this book makes me not want to continue reading another Harry Bosch novel for a long time. While the story itself is pretty easy to follow, it just feels stagnant and again, I blame this toward the slow pace of the book. As for the characters, there's not much to go on here. If you've been introduced to Harry Bosch already, then you'll be glad to know that he's more or less the same person and that's a good thing. However, I would really hate it if the author continues to pit him together romantically with a new female character in every book. The author spends time reminding us of how meek and lonely his life is but with him getting to bed 2-3 women every book, I somehow don't believe that picture anymore. Obviously I want him to be happy but it's going to get pretty irritating if he's going to be one of those dude who can't help but be attracted to every victim's wife or girlfriend.With the book moving at such a slow pace, many a times I wondered if it would have been better if the author wrote in another characters point of view rather than just focusing on Bosch the entire book. I mean let's face it. Bosch is definitely a likable character but he's hardly the most exciting to read about. Reading The Black Ice felt just like Bosch getting hints and clues throughout the most part of the boook and then BAM! The author finally throws in the action sequences and the book ends. It also doesn't help the book that it has the typical cliche ending.All in all, I felt disappointed with reading The Black Ice. After coming off with such a great introductory book, this sophomore effort just fell short. It's not memorable in any way, had characters you didn't care about, sparse action sequences and a ending that was not worth all the reading you've done to get to that point. I definitely don't feel like this book was a page turner and can't really imagine how anyone could say that of this book. I'm sorry but unless you have a syndrome like me who have the need to read every book in a series chronologically, I definitely would advise you to skip this one and move on to the next.

Bosch's supervisor, Pounds, has some sentences that could use some contractions to make them more natural, but he doesn't spend enough time talking for it to matter.Again, Connelly provides a twist in the end that I did not see coming, and the whole mystery was very well done.

Lewis and Clark, the IA detectives who wanted nothing more than to drum Bosch out of the LAPD are both dead. In this book, we have Harry investigating the murder of an unidentified male who was found outside of a restaurant that is frequented by the detectives of the undercover drug unit. During the course of the investigation, Harry realizes that there might be a connection between his murder and the suicide of Officer Calexico Moore, found dead in a hotel room over the Christmas holidays. Moore is also the subject of an IA investigation, and the belief is that he is a dirty cop who took the easy way out. Reading The Black Echo and The Black Ice in quick succession really highlighted the thematic similarities between these two books - in each of them, an effort is made to use Harry Bosch's rogue nature in a way that benefits the individuals at the heart of the conspiracy. In both of them, the individuals vastly underestimate Bosch's tenacity as an investigator, losing control of their plans midway through the book. And both of them involves themes of institutional corruption.We again find Bosch in trouble with the LAPD brass, the subject of angry phone calls with management. He is, always, on the verge not just of firing, but probably of prosecution, for his policy violations. He has no sense of self-preservation. The intertwined cases lead him to the border towns of Calexico and Mexicali, where he runs afoul of the powerful head of a drug syndicate. Given the present situation in Mexico, with the cartels, this book maintains its currency. Harry sees similarities between himself and Calexico Moore, a fact which makes him very uncomfortable. The reader is finding out more about Harry's personal history, that his mother was a prostitute who was murdered when he was 12, that he grew up in foster care, and that his father, it turns out, was a prominent lawyer named Haller, and that he has a half brother - through Haller's legitimate family. We will get to know Mickey Haller in some of the later books. There is a description of the one meeting that Bosch had with his father, while he was dying of cancer. Arm chair diagnosing of Harry Bosch would lead to an assessment that he probably has some sort of attachment disorder related to being shuffled between foster homes and orphanages. So far, we haven't met anyone who has gotten close to Harry Bosch - he holds everyone at arms length. For all of that, however, he is not a nihilist, believing firmly that life is sufficiently meaningful that to take it is the greatest crime. He is not swayed by the prominence of the victim, working just as hard on the case of an itinerant worker or a dead junkie as he would on a case where a more \"respectable\" victim is murdered.I've already finished The Concrete Blonde, so you can expect a review of that one soon. Happily, Connelly steps outside of his theme of institutional corruption in that one, and gives us a straight up murder mystery."}, {"userName": "Mona", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7020601-mona", "userReview": "[ But the autopsy raises doubts about whether the death was self-inflicted or a murder.

It was during this time that Michael Connelly introduced me to Harry Bosch. I've been a fan every since. I'm enjoying doing a re read of the series through the audio books. It's easy to look overlook the faults in a series that is one's favorite and I freely acknowledge this tendency. However I think I get Harry Bosch. He is a driven individual. He is basically alone in the world (some exceptions). He is obsessed with justice. He has very little patience for police that don't take their calling seriously. He is flawed. He can be arrogant, disrespectful and a risk taker. Sometimes when he is pulling his shenanigans, he makes me very nervous and even a little embarrassed for him. But I understand why he does what he does. Justice. At the end of the day I wish we had more like him.Now one other thing, it has been nice to watch him mature. I knew it was happening but it was gradual and it became clearer upon rereading these first books. And despite that I like the newer Bosch better, I've missed the younger renegade a little. This is a tightly woven plot, that manages to surprise and entertain.

As he\u2019s opening some cards he hears something on the police scanner that piques his interest. A homicide detective is needed \u2026 but they haven\u2019t called Harry, who is the one on call? When he arrives at the scene and realizes the corpse is a missing narcotics officer he begins to understand. Rumor had it that Cal Moore had crossed over, fronting a new drug from Mexico called \u201cblack ice.\u201d The brass downtown don\u2019t want a hugely embarrassing case on their hands, so they quickly dub it a suicide and close the case. But Harry isn\u2019t convinced; he suspects the man was murdered. He starts his own investigation which leads him to several bloody murders on both sides of the border. So he decides he has to go to Mexicali to get answers. Connelly crafts a fast and furious suspense-filled thriller. Informants are reluctant to come forth; Moore\u2019s wife is circumspect; police files are contradictory; and Mexican authorities less than forthcoming. The pace is lightning quick, the plot twists come with no warning, and the reader isn\u2019t any more sure than Harry whom to trust. I was in a delighted state of confusion trying to figure out the clues as fast as Harry \u2013 and we both arrived at the conclusion at about the same point (thought Harry was still ahead of me). One thing I really like about this series \u2013 and, admittedly, I\u2019ve only read two books in the series \u2013 is that I\u2019m getting to know Harry Bosch little by little: his childhood, his relationships, his service in Vietnam. He\u2019s a richly drawn character with complex emotions. And I want to continue reading the series to get to know him better.Dick Hill does a great job of narrating the audio version.

From L.A. to the Mexican border, Harry follows the clues and uncovers a set of relationships that strangely parallel his own experience. Also, he gets more play than most other middle-aged cops I\u2019ve known.Harry\u2019s lone wolf persona and dogged pursuit of the truth, usually not the easy answer, puts him at odds with the bureau\u2019s higher-ups, which he generally handles by just solving cases. He\u2019s too valuable for them to bust down, but too much of a loose cannon to be given free rein. More of his personal history is revealed, in drips and drops, which I believe will continue until we know his whole history. This serves to make him a very interesting and dynamic character.The writing is well-paced, but I did have a problem with some of the dialogue. Fairly often, the characters seem incapable of speaking in contractions. This would work if it were consistant, or a feature of just one character, but as it is, I find myself contracting the words as I read them. \u201cI will go and see if I cannot find out what he is not telling us\u201d for example. I don\u2019t know anyone who talks like this, much less when it\u2019s interspersed with cop slang like \u201cten-four\u201d and other abbreviations.On the whole, though, I really like reading these books.

They may walk within society, but they are not a part of it. They are lonely, but they are not alone. They may be law-abiding and conform to the proper social mores, but they have very little patience for the law and politics. They have a sense of justice and morality all their own. Harry Bosch, the protagonist of Michael Connelly's long-running series, is one of these people. He is content with living a solitary life. His job, an LAPD homicide detective, is his life. He gets a paycheck, but he doesn't do it for the money. He doesn't play by the rules, mainly because he sees the rules as corrupt. He hates the bureaucrats and politicians and apathetic morons who have brought the LAPD to ruin.\"The Black Ice\", the second Bosch book by Connelly, is a brilliant, beautiful work of literary art. Connelly continues to straddle the fine line between genre and literary fiction, a feat that only a rare few in the mystery genre can pull off. In this book, Bosch investigates what appears to be a suicide of a burn-out cop named Cal Moore. Moore's body is found in a sleazy hotel room, his head blown off from what appears to be a self-inflicted shotgun shot, with an enigmatic suicide note (\"I found out who I was\") found near the body.Bosch is naturally skeptical, of course. He had just seen Moore a few days before the \"suicide\", and Moore did not seem to be as burned out as everyone claims. Lonely and sad, yes (his wife had just kicked him out, and IAD was breathing down his neck), but Bosch could relate to that. Moore was also apparently interested in an ongoing case about a Mexican drug cartel spreading black ice, a form of cocaine laced with heroin and PCP, that was slowly gaining popularity on the streets of L.A.Against the wishes of his superiors (of course), Bosch investigates Moore's suicide. Irregularities at the crime scene, discrepancies in the coroner's report, a murder of an informant and another cop with links to Moore, and a gut feeling lead Bosch to the conclusion that Moore's death was an elaborately staged murder made to look like a suicide. Bosch's investigation ultimately leads him to a small town in Mexico, the place where Moore was born and raised, and a tragic story of fathers and sons, a story that triggers Bosch's own tragic relationship with a father he barely knew.Connelly has definitely become my favorite author du jour. He has a definite knowledge about the realities of police procedural, the politics of the LAPD, and a clear understanding of the human condition. It makes me giddy thinking about the fact that there are over a dozen more books in the Bosch series that I have yet to read..."}, {"userName": "Marleen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1616365-marleen", "userReview": "There\u2019s something sad and lonely about Harry Bosch, and for some reason that appeals to me in a major way. Mostly because this sadness doesn\u2019t dictate his MO in life. What you get is a determined and smart cop, with great instincts. Harry\u2019s an individualist, and I can relate to that.This read is my third Harry Bosch book and the character is definitely growing on me. I can\u2019t imagine Harry doing anything else than being a police detective. This man has, at the heart, the integrity required, that many other detectives lack, to do the job. One might also say that Harry has a problem with bureaucracy , especially when those in charge are more concerned with their image, or their own power and ego than with the good functioning of police. You\u2019ll note that even if Harry\u2019s disgusted or in disagreement with the higher ranking officers, he will not deliberately antagonize anyone. He\u2019s just his own man.In THE BLACK ICE, narcotics officer Calexico Moore's body is discovered Christmas night in a seedy Hollywood motel, an apparent suicide. As the L.A. police higher-ups converge on the scene to protect the department from scandal, Harry Bosch inserts himself into the investigation. The trail Harry follows leads to Mexican drug gangs operating across the border, more specifically to the border towns of Calexico/Mexicali, which for me were fun to discover.I have to say that the plot of this second Harry Bosh book compelled me more than the first book. On a side note, it was also interesting to read that the \"black ice\" drug was a fictional drug invented by Connelly for his novel. I enjoy Michael Connelly\u2019s smart writing, and I know now that I\u2019m in for a treat when I decide to go for a Harry Bosch book.

I didn't pay strict attention, which is how I missed the, uh, battle between the helicopter and bull (how?), but I still just relaxed into it and enjoyed it all along the way. Despite the length of this series, I could easily see tearing through it in a couple of months if I didn't have other obligations.A lot of the strength of this series is in the character himself. Bosch is not just a loner, he's very isolated, and has been his whole life. We get very little of what is going on around him and absolutely none of what other people are thinking. It's hyper-focused on Bosch and his investigation and this works very, very well. The writing wrinkles from the first book are greatly reduced and this one comes off a lot smoother and more polished.So... clearly I'll just have to relisten to the entire audio at some point so I get to see what happened between the bull and the helicopter. Darn.The audio itself is very soothing and the narrator does a first rate job. As part of that whole Harry-is-hyper-isolated thing, a lot of his conversations end up being over radio or phone, and they add in sound effects on those parts, which actually adds to the feel of the book.

Bosch is a good lead who will keep you interested and move the story along but he has not yet become great.The one part I didn't like overall was the bull fighting but this is no way a reflection of the book but more a dislike to the so called \"sport\". It's a cultural thing I guess but it didn't add anything to the plot so could have been excluded in my eyes. I'm all for drug dealers and cops getting their head's blown off, but leave the bulls alone.Well worth the read, obviously start with the first in the series if you haven't read already, but it hasn't yet matched the Mickey Haller series for me as of yet.
