Orphan Anne Beddingfeld, in search of adventure, follows the clue in a note from the pocket of a murder victim. Her journey takes her on an ocean voyage from London to Africa, and finally to a lost island, on the trail of stolen diamonds. Nadina, a \"Russian\" dancer, receives a visit in her dressing room from Count Sergius Paulovitch. Both are in the service of a man they call \"the Colonel\", an international agent provocateur and criminal. After many years, \"the Colonel\" is retiring, leaving his agents high and dry. Nadina has double-crossed the Colonel, however, keeping some De Beers diamonds from a crime years before. She now plans to blackmail the Colonel with the diamonds.\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0633\u0627\u0644 2008 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0645\u0631\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0627 \u0644\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0642\u0647\u0648\u0647\u200c \u0627\u06cc\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u0622\u06af\u0627\u062a\u0627 \u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0632\u062f\u06cc\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0622\u06af\u0627\u0647\u060c 1385\u061b \u062f\u0631 362 \u0635\u061b \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u062f\u062e\u062a\u0631 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0627\u0645 \u00ab\u0622\u0646\u06cc\u00bb \u067e\u0633 \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0631\u06af \u067e\u062f\u0631\u0634 \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0645\u200c\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0647\u060c \u0628\u0627 \u0645\u0634\u06a9\u0644 \u0645\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0648\u062f. \u00ab\u0622\u0646\u06cc\u00bb \u0627\u0632 \u0644\u062d\u0627\u0638 \u0645\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0627 \u062a\u0646\u06af\u0646\u0627\u06cc \u0634\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u06cc \u0631\u0648\u0628\u0631\u0648 \u0634\u062f\u0647. \u0622\u0642\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u062f\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u200c\u0641\u0644\u062f \u0648\u06a9\u06cc\u0644 \u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642 \u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0645\u062d\u0628\u062a\u200c\u0622\u0645\u06cc\u0632\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u0622\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u06cc\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0646\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u062d\u0627\u0636\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0648 \u0645\u0633\u06a9\u0646 \u0645\u062c\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0628\u062f\u0647\u062f\u060c \u0648\u0644\u06cc \u0622\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0644 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u067e\u06cc\u0634\u0646\u0647\u0627\u062f \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u067e\u0630\u06cc\u0631\u062f. \u0627\u0648 \u062a\u0635\u0645\u06cc\u0645 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f \u062f\u0648\u0631 \u062f\u0646\u06cc\u0627 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u06af\u0631\u062f\u062f \u0648 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u067e\u0631\u0645\u0627\u062c\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u06af\u06cc\u0631\u062f. \u00ab\u0622\u0646\u06cc\u00bb \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u062a\u0631\u0648\u060c \u0645\u0631\u062f \u0631\u06cc\u0632\u0646\u0642\u0634\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u0645\u06cc\u0628\u0628\u06cc\u0646\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0646\u0627\u06af\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u06cc \u0631\u06cc\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0641\u062a\u0627\u062f \u0648 \u062f\u0686\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0631\u0642\u200c\u06af\u0631\u0641\u062a\u06af\u06cc \u0634\u062f. \u0633\u067e\u0633 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0627 \u0644\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0642\u0647\u0648\u0647\u200c \u0627\u06cc \u0631\u0627\u0647\u0634 \u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0645\u0639\u06cc\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0632 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u06cc \u0633\u0631 \u0642\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0646\u062f\u060c \u0648 \u0627\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0646\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0622\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u062f \u0641\u0648\u062a \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u0633\u067e\u0633 \u0628\u0627 \u0639\u062c\u0644\u0647 \u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u062a\u06a9\u0647 \u06a9\u0627\u063a\u0630\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u062c\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06af\u0630\u0627\u0631\u062f\u060c \u06a9\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u06cc \u0622\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a\u0647 \"\u0642\u0644\u0639\u0647 \u06a9\u06cc\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0646\u060c 122-17\" ...\u061b \u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"}, {"userName": "jayne ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58877035-jayne", "userReview": "It is really a hard life. Men will not be nice to you if you are not good-looking, and women will not be nice to you if you are.My first encounter with Agathie Christie's work was not a disappointment - although, perhaps, it is not one of her most popular books, it was certainly an enjoyable entry into this genre. Think Africa and diamonds and adventure and mystery - welcome to 'The Man in The Brown Suit'. What I liked: \u2714\ufe0e-The fact that it was set in South Africa. Everybody's heard the famous saying that books allow the mind to travel and see what the eyes would normally not be able to. The hot, African climate and culture were huge assets of this book, creating a very intriguing backdrop to this mystery novel, and although some color connotations of the word 'murder mystery' might be black and grey, maybe darker browns or even white - this book put a complete twist to that stereotype. It was packed with colour and scenery (not too many descriptions), to create a vivid and entertaining read. \u2714\ufe0e-The travelling aspect. Like I mentioned previously, the setting in this book is marvelous. To be very blunt and save you from needless spoilers, let me just highlight the fact that there will be scenes in London; there will be cruises; and train rides and exploring waterfalls. That's enough you need to know. \u2714\ufe0e-The friendships (and romance) At one point, in this book our protagonist, Anne Beddingfield, meets a new acquaintance, and their friendship slowly develops over time into true companionship. Also, for those who like a little romance, there is definitely some present. It felt a little 'cheesy' at times, but sometimes, a little extra cheese is what you need. Their relationship was, to put, a little casually, very cute, although maybe it was a bit too much at times (especially when Anne immediately fell in love, claiming she loves him and wants to spend her life with him, when she literally just let him a couple of minutes ago, but still, it was heartwarming). \u2714\ufe0e-The actual mystery and murderer. Don't threat, I won't spoil the ending for you, but let me just point out, that it was extremely well thought out (cheeky little rhyme there), and nothing is as it seems to be. \u2714\ufe0e-There were references to things Christie experienced herself. I read a very interesting blog on wordpress (SPOILERS: https://www.google.pl/amp/s/knowingch...) that claimed that some of the characters might have been based on people she met, and there was a particular scene (the one with stray cats) that was loosely based of the time where she had attempted to rescue a dog. \u2714\ufe0e-Two points of views. This kept the book fast paced and very misleading, although Pedler was extremely sexist and sarcastic - his diary entries were interesting to read, and he was a little hilariously pathetic at times. The only problem with this book was that: \u2718- I, at times, found myself very irritated with Anne and, although, I admit to her being very brace and intelligent - her actions didn't always do her wits justice. Some of her decisions were a little immature, and if not for one special person, I doubt she'd be alive at the end of the novel. \u2718- Also, I found myself a little lost with all the clues, but that might be because I am very inexperienced with this genre, and just need to pay more attention. A reread might be in order, although I'm not a big fan of re-reading books. Overall, my first experience with an Agathe Christie book was a success. Hopefully, I'll be able to read more soon.

Dame Agatha Christie included Hercule Poirot in 45 books and Miss Jane Marple in more than a dozen. Even Tommy and Tuppence Beresford appear in four novels and a collection of short stories. But Jane Beddingfield appears only in The Man in the Brown Suit (although another character in this novel, the debonair Colonel Race, went on to appear in three more). More\u2019s the pity! I would trade Tuppence Beresford and three dozen more heroines for Anne any day of the week, and how wonderful it would be to have a dozen Anne Beddingfield novels to read!Anne Beddingfield, the daughter of a famous but impecunious archeologist, dreams of a life of adventure right out of the Rhodesian romance novels and the cliffhanger film series The Perils of Pamela she adores. On her father\u2019s death, the intrepid orphan is so anxious for adventure that she casts caution to the wind after witnessing the death of one L.B. Carton at the Hyde Park Tube Station. Anne spends her last \u00a386 to travel on the ship Kilmorden Castle to continue her investigation into both Carton\u2019s murder and a related one. Onboard ship, Anne gets enough excitement to satisfy anyone \u2014 including any reader lucky enough to get a hold of this book. I know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but Anne really is plucky, clever, and imaginative, and I fell in love with her immediately. I only wish I could enjoy her in some sequels. Highly, highly recommended.Narrator Emilia Fox on the Audible edition of The Man in the Brown Suit makes the tale even more sublime."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1242515-hannah", "userReview": "A great read. As always, Christie is a master of the crime/detective genre, managing to make this a fun and exciting romp without decreasing any of the mystery and sense of the sinister. All of the characters had their own charms, but Colonel Race really made the book, even though he seemed to stay in the backdrop a lot of the time. I must say I felt rather sorry for his lack of luck with Anne, but I'm looking forward to revisiting his character in the later books. Anne, although not the most likeable heroine, is spunky and fearless, and her romance with Harry is one of the highlights of this book. There's always something attractive about a brave and pretty young lady on an adventure falling in love with a handsome, rugged young man who's been framed for murder. Christie turns this tired old cliche into something that holds your interest and makes you want to turn the page.The Man in the Brown Suit is a must-read for all Christie fans, and those who fancy a fast and furious bit of reading fun. There's a little of something in it for everyone; a crime (and its solving), unique characters, a spot of romance, and an all-round adventure."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P."}, {"userName": "Veronique", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12371602-veronique", "userReview": "4.5*\u201cI had the firm conviction that, if I went about looking for adventure, adventure would meet me halfway. It is a theory of mine that one always gets what one wants.\u201dThe Man in the Brown Suit, or Anna the Adventurous, was published as a serial in 1923, and is completely over the top! Instead of our \u2018usual\u2019 detective story, we have a thriller, involving an international crime organisation with a secret arch-villain at its head, although there is of course murder and mystery. All starts with our intrepid heroine witnessing a man fall to his death at Hyde Park station. Add to this a piece of paper with a cryptic clue, the smell of mothballs, and a man in a brown suit, and our Anna throws herself to the chase, leading her into ever more dangerous situation, and a trip to South Africa!!You do still get Christie\u2019s sarcastic self through the lines, with the wicked wit shining through the descriptions and narration, but this is ultimately \u2018just\u2019 a fun adventure.

Anne was a feisty, independent minded protagonist. She was a bit of an insta detective though. A good range of supporting characters. It was also interesting to read about South Africa and Rhodesia: contemporary fiction at the time, and now historical fiction.

You get used to the idea that she's the creator of Poirot, of Marple, even of Tommy and Tuppence. Those characters can almost become more important than the novel itself, and when you read a Christie that doesn't have the distraction of a famous detective creation you can be surprised by just how good Christie can be. To be fair, those other novels with Poirot in are pretty good too but this one struck me that I was just enjoying \nThe Man in the Brown Suit\n on it's own single-novel merits than with say a Poirot where I'm in part enjoying revisiting the characters she's created.Anne Beddingfield is a woman of spirit. When she witnesses a man falling in front of a train on the Underground she suspects there's more to what, at first glance, appears to be just a tragic accident. Before we know it, she's into full-on adventuress mode and booking cruises and train journeys and chasing down various suspects. At various times she suspects pretty much everybody in the cast of course, so we're left none the wiser. You assume Colonel Race is in the clear \u2013 in part because Anne suspects him too much but mostly because he goes on to appear in a couple of later Poirots as a supporting character (although, this is Christie, even that doesn't give him a free pass) \u2013 and Mrs. Blair who seems to be having far too much fun helping Anne to be the baddy. Anne's narrative is interspersed with extracts from Sir Eustace's diary, which is a clever idea allowing Christie to provide extra information outside of Anne's direct experience.All the characters \u2013 apart from Colonel Race \u2013 appear to be exaggerated for comedic effect. Anne is super spunky; Mrs. Blair is the rich widow (although she's still married she spends so much time apart from her husband she may as well be) who wants to adopt Anne; Sir Eustace is a somewhat pervy older bachelor writing his memoirs; the put upon suspect of the police \u2013 the titular man in the brown suit \u2013 is rugged, handsome and difficult, etc. and so on. They're mostly silly, but not too overdone. Characters get to appear and disappear in various disguises, even changing gender, and everybody is fooled. But it works, like Superman and his glasses. As a final cherry on the top, the novel features a nicely clever bit of unreliable narration which I always enjoy."}, {"userName": "F.R.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1309606-f-r", "userReview": "Forget the mystery, forget the complex scheme hatched by a mysterious criminal mastermind, Agatha Christie\u2019s \u2018The Man in the Brown Suit\u2019 is really a spoof. Written in 1924 it has the suspense serial, the kind with feisty, flapper heroines at their centre, directly in its sights. But hang on, it's more than that: this was actually written in serialised form as \u2018Anne the Adventuress\u2019 and so right from the off it is both satirising the over the top adventure story whilst wholeheartedly being one.We have here Anne Beddingfield, a recently orphaned, beautiful young woman, who craves adventure. On witnessing a mysterious death at a tube station, she throws herself impulsively into the mystery and before long is sailing to South Africa on the trail of a mysterious criminal mastermind. Peril is never far away for feisty Anne: she is nearly strangled aboard ship, kidnapped by a fake museum curator, and \u2013 most incredibly \u2013 lured into walking off the side of a ravine. But the indomitable spirit of this courageous Miss can\u2019t be stopped, and she\u2019s back on the trail as tenacious as ever.This is looser, fresher, funnier Christie than is the norm. It helps that the book half acknowledges that its heroine is a tad dim (if she, and her friends, had a better memory for faces the mystery would be over much sooner), and the result is triumphantly a novel that spoofs the genre, whilst buying into it completely and celebrating it. The mystery falls into the background as we follow Anne through one scrape after another, relishing her ability to regain her poise after every mis-step, whilst wondering at just how it is she makes so many glaring mistakes.Obviously this being Christie it\u2019s a book locked into the English class structure and the value of colonialism; there are also some views on marriage that might raise a few eyebrows, whilst the assertion at the end that the main victim was \u201cthe kind of woman who deserved to die\u201d does seem a bit harsh after the light souffl\u00e9 of a book which has gone before. But this is a fine self-aware adventure, which knows it\u2019s being absurd even as it\u2019s taking itself seriously, and is without a doubt the most fun I have ever had with Dame Agatha."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan", "userReview": "This is one of Agatha Christie's best stand alone novels - part mystery, part thriller and part espionage story - which takes us from a London tube station to revolution in Africa. It begins with Anne Beddingfeld, the daughter of a professor who longs for adventure. She spends her day trying to placate creditors and longing to 'step out' with a young man. When her father dies, she takes an opportunity to go to London, where, quite by chance, she witnesses the death of a young man at a tube station. Finding a piece of paper dropped by the 'doctor' at the scene, she believes the death to be linked to that of the murder of a young woman at the house of Sir Eustace Pedlar. With only eighty five pounds to her name, her deductions ignored by the police, she boards a ship bound for South Africa. On board she meets not only Sir Eustace Pedlar but his secretary Guy Pagett, the society beauty Suzanne Blair, the enigmatic Colonel Race and the attractive Harry Rayburn. If she can find out who the man in the brown suit is, seen leaving Sir Pedlar's house shortly after the murder, she hopes for a job on the Daily Budget and life as a journalist.What follows is more of an adventure than the enterprising Anne could ever have dreamed of when she was tucked away in the quiet countryside. Some of the people Anne meets are certainly not who they appear to be and, before events have sorted themselves out, she will be kidnapped, nearly murdered (more than once!), face criminal gangs, find love and unearth the mysterious 'Colonel'. An excellent introduction to Christie if you haven't tried her books before.

But, in true Christie fashion, she explains it all so clearly by the end that I find myself wondering how I missed the clues early on.This is one of my favorite Christie books! I love our main character, Anne. She's spunky, intelligent, clever, and fearless. But she's also nice and sometimes a bit innocent about what she's getting herself involved in. And she's not above falling in love (albeit perhaps a bit too quickly).Our other main character, Sir Eustace Pedler, is enjoyable in his own right! Snippets of his diary are peppered throughout the tale, and he's such an entertaining, whiny, funny character, that his dynamic really adds to the story.Another aspect that helps make this book so delightful (aside from it's great mystery, and it's main setting in Africa) is that it's one of the more romantic Christie mysteries. Now, could some of the romantic scenes be viewed as a bit overdramatic? Yes. Did I care? Somehow, no! For whatever reason the drama works here, and I simply adored it!The only \"negative\" is that there are some rather (as we would see them now) backward ideas about women's relationships to men. It's interesting, because it seems to paint the idea that women want to be subservient to men, but in the way Christie drew the characters, I got the sense Anne would be anything but! Perhaps it was reflective of the state of the world at the time, the changes that were occurring. But, whatever the reason, there are only a few references to this, and weren't enough to deter my enjoyment of the characters overall.There's a delightful cast of characters, as is usual for Chrisite. And I was pleased that this mystery (while it did involve a few deaths) wasn't gruesome or detailed. More of a \"who dunnit\" solved by place, access, and character.It was one of my favorite Christie tales ten years ago. And it still is!I might not wait ten years to read it again :)Started re-reading on July 2, 2013...wow... I can hardly believe it was ten years ago I read this!!!***Originally Read January 2003***A great mystery filled with great characters! It is set in Africa I believe and it filled with possible \"bad guys\" out of the various travelers. Sorrry I can't offer more... it's been a while since I read it, but I did love it!"}, {"userName": "C.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10501026-c", "userReview": "I savour Agatha Christie in order of her releases. I don\u2019t identify ahead what pertains to which series, nor watch any films lest I be wholly surprised by my journey; 90 years after \u201cThe Man In The Brown Suit\u201d, came out. The gift this gives me is that each time I open the front page, it is a treat to discover which heroes shall escort me. Agatha experimented with these first four; three are unrelated. This one has nothing to do with her two famous sleuths. I was blissfully unprepared for that surprise.We move briskly, set formulaic traditions askew, and I many times chuckled in my bed. When I reviewed \u201cThe Mysterious Affair At Styles\u201d I was stunned by Agatha\u2019s plotting and exquisite language but not in love with that cast. I gave 3 stars, saving room for novels to rate higher. Here is a 5! The daughter of a single-minded palaeontologist is freed from caring for him and witnesses an accident that wasn\u2019t investigated properly. Bolstered by her keenness at filling in the blanks, she willingly follows the case aboard a ship; creating one of the most fantastic novels I have ever read. I adored every page!Running around Africa on the strength of wild intellect, deft disguises, old and new crimes culminating, Kimberly diamonds, and even romance. The hilarious dialogues between \u2018Anne\u2019 and her shipmates create a successful book as it is. I adore Suzanne Blair as much as Anne. What makes it extraordinary is its peculiar flow. There are no weak personalities. Anne & Suzanne thrive on every intrigue, with resolve we believe. The shifts and twists are smooth. The oddest thing is, the ladies deduce a great deal very early. With trivialities settled aboard ship; one imagines the adventuring in Africa can only be grand!"}, {"userName": "Raoofa Ibrahim", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14485406-raoofa-ibrahim", "userReview": "\u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u0643\u062a\u0628\u062a \u0627\u063a\u0627\u062b\u0627!\u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u062e\u0631\u062c\u062a \u0627\u063a\u0627\u062b\u0627 \u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0623\u0644\u0648\u0641\u060c \u0641\u0623\u0633\u0647\u0628\u062a \u0628\u0630\u0643\u0631 \u062a\u0641\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0643\u0646 .. \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0627\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0642\u062f \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0649 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u062c\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u062a\u062d\u062a\u0627\u062c \u0644\u0644\u062d\u0644.------\u0628\u0637\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0647\u064a: \u0622\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u0633\u062a \u0627\u064a \u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u063a\u0627\u062b\u0627\u0622\u0646 \u0647\u064a \u0641\u062a\u0627\u0629 \u062a\u0639\u064a\u0634 \u0645\u0639 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u060c \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0628\u0639\u0634\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u0644\u062f\u0631\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0642\u062f \u064a\u0646\u0633\u0649 \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0627\u0635\u062f\u0642\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0627\u0644!

Sin duda esta mujer sabe c\u00f3mo escribir historias atrapantes que se te pasen volando; es cierto que a veces lo dejaba abandonado por unos d\u00edas, pero puedo decir con certeza que, cuando lo retomaba, disfrutaba de cada p\u00e1gina.Tengo que admitir que soy medio lela para los misterios; empezando con que no es mi g\u00e9nero favorito ni uno que leo con frecuencia. Pero mi punto es que ni en pel\u00edculas, series ni libros logro adivinar qui\u00e9n es el asesino, o el culpable, vamos, que nunca descifro el misterio. Pero mi problema no es que no pueda conectar los puntos entre s\u00ed ni nada de eso, es simplemente que no logro que el misterio me importe. Y no lo digo de una manera en la que \"oh, este libro no me import\u00f3\", porque no es verdad. Es simplemente que siempre me veo mucho m\u00e1s inmersa en la historia en general, y mismo en la investigaci\u00f3n, pero nunca me puedo poner a m\u00ed misma en el papel de investigadora. S\u00ed que me interesa el resultado final, claro, y me encanta acompa\u00f1ar a nuestros protagonistas mientras van descubriendo pistas y as\u00ed, pero simplemente me olvido de hacer teor\u00edas propias. Tal vez suene medio triste, pero de todas formas no influy\u00f3 en mi disfrute de esa novela. Adem\u00e1s, quiero agregar por el bien de mi dignidad, s\u00ed que predigo cosas en libros normales, osea, si que me doy cuenta de cosas, s\u00f3lo que en los misterios-misterios no tengo esa ansia de ponerme toda detectivesca.En este libro seguimos a Anne, una protagonista que me gust\u00f3 y con la que simpatic\u00e9 much\u00edsimo. Estoy decepcionada de que no tengamos m\u00e1s libros con ella, porque en serio que me gust\u00f3 su personalidad y su historia. Algo que me gust\u00f3 de este libro: c\u00f3mo de alguna forma Anne como persona muchas veces ten\u00eda m\u00e1s importancia que le misterio en s\u00ed.El resto de los personajes me gust\u00f3 mucho tambi\u00e9n, sobre todo Sir Eustace, y su extra\u00f1o modo de hacerme quererle. El romance que hubo en esta novela no fue la gran cosa ni nada, pero estuvo bien.Otro aspecto a destacar es el viaje por \u00c1frica por el que Christie nos lleva. Lo hace parecer un elemento s\u00faper secundario, pero en realidad el ambiente, la atm\u00f3sfera que nos rodea son maravillosos, y la historia no hubiera sido lo mismo sin ellos. La aplaudo por ser capaz de describir la esencia de los lugares con tanta naturalidad, por transportarme all\u00ed.El final, as\u00ed como la disoluci\u00f3n del misterio, fue bastante t\u00edpico. Osea, al estilo pel\u00edcula de los 70\u00b4s. Eso no quiere decir que no me haya gustado, porque lo hizo, y capaz que me gust\u00f3 un poquito m\u00e1s por eso mismo, el t\u00f3pico. De todas formas, hubo un giro en particular que me dej\u00f3 pirando, y por eso, una vez m\u00e1s, aplaudo a la Reina del Misterio.Este no fue un libro que me vol\u00f3 la mente ni nada por el estilo, pero lo disfrut\u00e9, sobre todo los personajes y el estilo en general."}, {"userName": "classic reverie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37374526-classic-reverie", "userReview": "In the early 1990's I was first introduced to Agatha Christie's novels and was quickly drawn into her stories. Before the days of Amazon and Kindles, I would enjoy a visit to the local bookstore and find if they had any new to me Agatha paperbacks. I read a good number but that was limited to availability, so many like this story I had never read. Life became busy and my reading dropped off until my Kindle days started but even though I had many Christie kindle books, I only have read a handful which I enjoyed but my LOVE for her novels is back after reading \"The Man in the Brown Suit\"!!! An Goodreads friend (Radwa)[Thanks you!!! :)] suggested \"Sparkling Cyanide\",which I was about to start reading until I came on the page that stated this was book 1 of a series, so I decided to read this and then follow up with book 4- \"Sparkling Cyanide\" . I decided to read books 2 & 3 when I read Hercule Poirot series because they are part of that series too, so I leave it till then. I always find it interesting how books \"drop in our laps\", meaning how a book is choosen over others to be read next. Enough of that...I loved this story from the get go and was wondering throughout what the mysteries were and how Christie would play this out. I remember being always surprised when I was younger and being older now, she still surprised me with her twists but living life I could see somethings coming I would not think possible in my youth but still quite not sure given how it was played out or if it would go that direction. Up to the very last she shocked me with her twists. I loved it!! I also don't remember Christie being so humorous that I was laughing inwardly to her word play. If you like adventure, romance, murder mystery and other mysteries, then this book is a perfectly wonderful read for you! In brief the story, right after Anne's father dies this orphan girl finds herself involved in a mysterious caper of sorts which has intrigue at every corner."}, {"userName": "Nanosynergy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1354230-nanosynergy", "userReview": "A 1924 mystery/romance by Dame Agatha Christie - who knew!?

It had a much more lighthearted feel, than many of Christie's other novels, and I found myself chuckle on quite a few occasions.Anne, who has always dreamed of being a great adventuress, seizes the moment when she witnesses a man fall to his death at a train station. Convinced it wasn't just an accident, she follows the clues all the way aboard a ship, that's about to start its voyage to Africa. Having spent the last of her money on a ticket, she's determined to solve the mystery, even if it leads her to the other side of the world.Add a bunch of hilarious characters, Eustace being my favourite, a mad romance and a revolution, and this story makes for a crazy couple of hours of reading.The book did include a few very old-fashioned thoughts on marriage, usually by a character that was everything but old-fashioned, which seemed a little strange. There was also a rather horrendous quote about one of the victims, who apparently was 'the kind of woman who deserved to die' towards the end of the book, which left me with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.Christie seems prone to making such strange statements in a few of her books, that I've come across so far. It's one of the things I'm not really liking about her writing .All up, it was a fun romp though, that's probably one of my favourites of Christie's standalones so far."}, {"userName": "\u262fEmily ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4074840-emily", "userReview": "[I found Anne's attitude toward the one who tried to murder her both puzzling and unlikely.
