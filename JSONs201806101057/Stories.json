A couple of years ago I arrived in San Francisco and every so often stayed on the floor of my friend's closet, which happened to hold no clothing but a section of his library. We had our enthusiasms and differences in literary taste. I found it hard to believe someone could actually recommend Clancy or Franzen in the same instance as Bataille or Berryman, and remained skeptical in some of our 4 AM discussions in the closet over Charles Shaw, Rockport, or Dante wine. One of the three. In the clarity which is a remarkably confident person being caught off guard, I remember the night I took The Sheltering Sky off of the shelf and inquired, as I'd only know of Bowles from extensively studying the Beat Generation in my teens, a point in time I had thoroughly removed myself from by that summer, by then considering the Beats (Especially after the traumatizing adolescent chagrin of arriving at City Lights to find Ginsberg bumper stickers on display, and the fedora-clad cashier* not knowing who Herbert Huncke was) one of my passageways to adventure, intellectual stimulation, when I had not traveled, and lived in the middle of nowhere.I recall my friend saying he did not know what to say about The Sheltering S, a fine nocturnal way as any of admitting to not have finished it, but that he preferred the short stories.Well, I am still in avid avoidance of people like Johnathan Franzen, but when I was out buying presents at the used bookstore the other day and I saw the exact edition of The Sheltering Sky I had to take another peek. The Kafka quote sold me, to the effect of: 'There comes a point where there is no turning back; that is the point to be reached.'The short stories were next to the novel. I had to laugh, skim through, then purchase both. My old friend from the closet was right here: The stories are really good. They evoke the scent, the setting, of writing by pencil in a hut, smoking hash and drinking extremely powerful tea, sifting through the breeze-enhanced lucidity of dreams within nightmares, nightmares composed of self-induced, albeit subtle, disaster, yet not always without hope; hence, the perpetual return trip; a kaleidoscopic whirlpool of the mind, harmoniously balanced by linguistic and structural mastery.The stories read like dual first-hand reports: The stranger in a strange land, possessing a camera-eye, intact with x-ray vision into the veins and minds of mankind, the human condition, as seen through an American transported to Morocco.The Bowelsian subtlety, the shadowy style, each syllable perfectly place, each analogy not spot on, little repetition; this collection's a quiet gem for me. I mean that in the instance of not quite rushing out and recommending the shorter fiction to everyone. Kind of like the short work of Tennessee Williams. Little spoken of, but when acknowledged, met with bewildering acclaim, little gems in the cannon of the English language. Well then, why not share!?To quote the friend who introduced me to this book, when, naively, I asked him why the media portrayed San Franciscans as homosexual, drug addicted, both, or insane (The futile implication there an obvious propaganda tool, thus one that confused me as a youngster, that the citizens of that great city did not care). Oh, it's easy, he said. We don't care because it keeps all the idiots out of the city. And while the term idiot applies zero in my case, the work of Paul Bowles is, for me, another, private world, one which I will re-read over the years, recommend once or twice, and return to, preferably over cheap California wine, in a closet, past midnight, when I temporarily lose faith in the art of literature, only to return from the work the way a relighted fuse burns faster, and onto business, that of alphabetical delirium. *There is nothing wrong with fedoras, save they're like not be worn between the ages of 30 and 70, or so I am told."}, {"userName": "Andrew Kramcsak", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/256762-andrew-kramcsak", "userReview": "There are some chilling stories in this tome.

Other-ness, in Bowles's stories, functions like Nietzsche's void: When it is stared into by a protagonist, prodded or investigated or even ostensibly subjugated, it is always staring right back \u2014 waiting to infiltrate the protagonist, to explode him or her from the inside.In his introduction to this edition of the collected stories, Robert Stone writes of a certain \"'something missing'\" that many readers of Bowles claim to feel, and to balk at. We \"trade sympathy for the absence of ordinariness,\" Stone writes. It's more than that, though. If there is a single universe or sensibility uniting these stories, it's one in which the Other is utterly corrosive to the Self. It's not that Bowles has left empathy out of these stories, it's that he constructs stories in which empathy is impossible. There is a coldness here, a repetitive cruelty, that made these stories difficult for me to read at times. So perhaps my giving these stories four stars instead of five is more a reflection of my own tastes and beliefs than it is of the icy power of Bowles's art. I'd argue, though, that for all the \"absence of ordinariness\" Bowles gives us in setting, character, and plot, in theme he strikes the same few notes over and over \u2014 strikes them beautifully, masterfully, no doubt, but I felt a certain monotony nonetheless."}, {"userName": "Duffy Pratt", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2729963-duffy-pratt", "userReview": "I read these over a long time, so almost none of the stories are fresh in my memory. Bowles writes beautifully. His stories, and attitude about human nature, make Conrad seem like an optimist. At their core, for Bowles, people are unknowable and terrifying. He illustrates this again and again by showing a lack of understanding between the natives of North Africa, and the visitors and expatriates who are mostly the subject of the stories. The stories can be funny, savage, and wise - sometimes all three at once."}, {"userName": "Rupert", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121599-rupert", "userReview": "One of my favorite all time books.

I've read almost every novel he's written. This huge volume has short stories galore and is pure Paul Bowles.

I love Paul Bowles!"}, {"userName": "Larou", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7821634-larou", "userReview": "Paul Bowles is probably best known for his novel The Sheltering Sky, and likely more for the movie made from it rather than his book, but apparently (at least I seem to remember reading that somewhere and I\u2019m too lazy to look it up) he himself considered his stories his superior effort, and it would of course not be the first time that \u201cmost popular\u201d does not coincide with \u201cbest\u201d. I cannot judge that claim that myself, not having read any of Paul Bowles\u2019 novels (yet \u2013 but I hope to remedy that eventually), but I do not regret having made my way through the almost 700 pages (or their Kindle equivalent) of this collection.I do not think anyone would claim for Bowles the status of a major literary figure - he is rather too firmly entrenched in the comfortable conventions of nineteenth-century realism for most of his career, and by the time he risks to wander outside of this familiar ground into modernist territory, that also has already become thoroughly explored and mapped by more adventurous authors. Bowles is interesting on a thematic level rather than a formal one \u2013 which is not to say that he is a bad writer, his stories would not be literature if there was not some kind of interplay between form and content, but from a great author I\u2019d expect an attempt to go beyond the true and trusted, an attempt at transgression, at developing a unique voice. Paul Bowles to me just seems too complacent for that.Which is a bit weird, as thematically many of the stories in this collection concern themselves with the opposite of complacency. The works of Bowles are often said to be about Westerners (Europeans / Americans) and their encounter as well as the ensuing (often violent) disillusionment with the lure of foreign cultures (mostly North Africa / South America). But while that is true on a surface level it seems to me that there is another layer to this, one where the Europeans are not really blind to what is awaiting them, but seem on some level to actually crave the doom they are walking into. They might not be aware of it, might not consciously want it, but still desire it in some deep, hidden stratum of their personality. Whether one conceives of it in Freudian terms or not, I think most of Paul Bowles\u2019 stories can only be comprehended with some conception of an unconscious.Even if the stories have someone from an Non-Western culture as their protagonist or take place entirely in a Western context, there is almost always some kind of Other involved, often one that exercises some kind of dangerous, even fatal attraction on the protagonist; that Other can even be located inside the protagonist herself, as is the case with the narrator of \u201cYou are not I\u201d (who turns out to be insane). And while Bowles (except for some stories occurring very late in this volume, with their publishing date 1977 and later) never really moves beyond the conventions of realism, reality in his stories is quite often something that cannot quite be trusted.The protagonists in Bowles\u2019 stories are often strangely passive, offering no resistance to what is done to them, enduring what they are going through with tacit acceptance like it was preordained. It is not just that they are resigned to their fate but as if they could not even conceive of things being any different, and this unquestioning fatalism tinges everything with an eerie, dreamlike quality. And even in the rare cases where someone is acting, it is not with any real agency; instead, they get entangled in circumstances they do not oversee and set into motion events they cannot control (like the boy in \u201cSenor Ong and Senor Ha\u201d) or are outright delusional (like the narrator in \u201cYou are not I\u201d). They also quite often have something childlike about them (in fact, they surprisingly often are children or adolescents) in that they sense themselves to be surrounded by a vast conspiracy of grown-ups that they are not being let into and that is always just out of reach of their comprehension.Therefore, as vivid as Bowles\u2019 evocations of it can at times get, the world his characters\u2019 move through never seems quite real, it\u2019s texture and density are more akin to a fever dream or a drug-induced hallucination. Mind you, the stories never get explicitely phantastic or outright surreal, but they (at least the best among them) have a slightly off-kilter feel to them, like they were slightly out of focus, or maybe on the contrary too crisp and sharp in the details to be quite real. This can be rather disquieting to the reader, even creepy, and at least in my opinion it is in those moments, when the hold of realist conformity on Bowles\u2019 imagination slips that he is at his most impressive.In ending, let me add a remark on the edition of this collection: It sucks. It sucks, because it is pretty much non-existent. I am aware that this is not a critical edition, but even so \u2013 all the readers gets here is a short and not particularly introduction by Robert Stone and the year of first publication at the end of each story. One would have at the very least some information on when the stories were composed, where they were published and where collected, whether this are the complete stories of Paul Bowles, and if not, on what grounds they were selected \u2013 all very basic stuff that even a non-academic reader is likely to be curious about and that might help with placing the stories in a context and all of wich is missing from this edition."}, {"userName": "Abby", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6262367-abby", "userReview": "I am all about under-read brilliant authors this year, apparently, because GUYS.

Many stories involve Morocco, where Bowles lived for most of his adult life, and almost every story involves a compelling character brought to life by Bowles's vivid, perfect prose.

North Africa is not Mayberry, U.S.A. And Bowles shows how humanity can exist in multitude forms, live in ways that crumble existing norms, cultural, spiritual, and of the soul. That even life and death are defined and hardened into each culture wherein they \"live\" (or die). Sexual morays. Personal relationships. What makes our shadows alive with new monsters. In this day and age of cultural melding and our necessary leaning on diversity and similarity of humane purpose, Bowles shows us that our brothers and sisters squatting in tawny dust, sitting, waiting, living-- a plane flight away, have heart and soul, but live them through their specific cultural milieu, and that WE are arrogant in our supposition that \"normal\" for us is \"normal\" everywhere. But his greatest contribution through his work is that it is transcendent art. As with the best artists, his work leaves room for the reader to take what Bowles gives and make the work specific for the interpreter. The nightmares. The dark angst in the narrow alleys. Sickness, dying in inhospitable places. All these are small doors that lead to courtyards that the readers inhabit with our impressions and conclusions.

All his characters, in one way or another, stray cheerfully from their comfortable cocoons into territory that's strange and treacherous, though they never discover this until it's too late.You might think Bowles' overarching theme of creeping menace that ultimately does the protagonist in would become monotonous, but it never does. That's because each setting is fresh, each character different. Each situation contains a shocking new element of exotic danger. There is humor in stories like \"Pastor Dowe at Tacate\" and \"You Have Left Your Lotus Pods on the Bus.\" \"Pages from Cold Point\" carries an extra kick because the exotic outsider who ruins the protagonist is his own son. Bowles is the all time master of creeping menace. He can write a sentence that looks bland and innocent, yet contains a depth charge that lets you know something is coming, something that won't end well. He's often said to be unemotional, unsentimental. I don't think this is entirely correct. He shares coolness with the beat writers who idolized him, yet his stories pack emotional wallop precisely because they're so remorseless.

But you should know that most of these stories are a slow burn. Even the short short stories have a pensively sluggish payoff. So if you are in the mood, the market, the mindset for literary work that isn't precisely fast paced, I think you might appreciate Bowles' writing. I get the impression that if I'd read this during the winter rather than the spring, my interaction with the text would have differed.Now then, I loved the setting. The story's geography kept calling me back, even in times of disenchantment. The setting pulled me around like a tugboat hauling an unwieldy barge until once more I was reading (yes, I just referred to myself as an unwieldy barge).

Maybe the picture sounds convincing for me as a foreigner, of course, but in reality it can be far from the truth, from reality, since his forays into woman's psychology, for example, are from accurate and don't sound convincing.
