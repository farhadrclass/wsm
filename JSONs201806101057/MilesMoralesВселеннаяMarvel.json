And if you think that pun was forced and totally dumb...then you are 100% right my friend. But I have no shame. I basically haven't ever found a Miles Morales comic (even though this is a prose book!) so this was like my first intro AND I REALLY LIKED IT. I also really have no freaking clue why Marvel keeps remaking Peter Park when they could do Miles?!??!?!WHAT I LIKED:\u2022 It was really well written! I tell you, fiends, Jason Reynolds is such a fantastic writer. I loved All American Boys so much too!\u2022 Miles is pretty much a precious cupcake of goodness. He is SO GOOD and like sometimes that can be irritating to read about someone who'd choke to death if you suggested they, like, do something even slightly bad. But Miles was really endearing. He was so committed to being a good little spiderman. GO MILES.\u2022 Epically diverse cast! All the main characters were POC and how excellent is this.\u2022 Also Ganke was pretty much a gift. He's Korean and a bit of the dorky comedic side kick but he was just GREAT and I love how Miles confided in him and they were solidly good friends. Even if Miles is SO GOOD he literally can't even steal cheesepuffs off his friend. I am...so...not like Miles.\u2022 anyway\u2022 moving forward\u2022 It also deals with racism and #BlackLivesMatter. Which I think is freaking awesome. Like here is a book about SUPERHEROES and important issues as well!! It's a book that really sees the world and wants to talk about it.OKAY SO THE NOT GREAT STUFF?...\u2022 Honestly there's about 15% spidery action. I actually feel frustrated when we get these superhero books buuuut they're more about the teens NOT BEING THE HERO. Why, fren. Why. I came here for webs and spider bites and there are actual WHOLE CHAPTERS of Miles just buying a frikkin' pizza.\u2022 So it was a bit slow. Basically too much of Miles going \"I'm not cut out to be spidey\" and dramatically angsting...and...I just...mate.\u2022 Plus I feel we missed the origin story?! It was basically slapped in one paragraph and I just??? I think this would've been WAY more of an interesting story if it had been about Miles getting bitten and used as a vigilante by his slightly-bad-side uncle. I MEAN.\u2022 Also lowkey annoyed that it brought up his cousin and then let that thread die. I have questions about Austin. Like, maybe 3 questions. Maybe 4. I feel like the book kind of forgot about him?!??ALL IN ALL?! Spider maaaaan does whatever a sPIDER CAN...except he also goes to school and I don't think most arachnids do. Although who am I to judge. I don't know their lives. How dare I. Anyhow I loved how this book mixed superpowers and important life topics and tackled racism, crappy teachers, pleasing strict parents, and basically just learning to be yourself and be brave. I just was a bit \"eh\" with the plot. Also it's \"younger YA\" but still MILES IS ADORABLE and I wish I knew more about him?! I need some comics stat."}, {"userName": "Nic Stone", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24089027-nic-stone", "userReview": "Before reading this novel, I thought: COOL! A Black and Puerto Rican superhero slinging webs and saving lives! After reading, I think the same thing... but MAN is there so much more to this book than that. Truthfully, I was expecting Spider-Man's regular antics, just with some brown skin beneath the spandex suit (silly me, though, right? This is a Jason Reynolds book. Obviously not going to be that cut and dry). What I HADN'T considered was that being a \"superhero\" would be a fundamentally different experience for a Black-Latino kid. And that's what Jason Reynolds so deftly lays out in this story. Miles Morales, in addition to the pressure of an un-ignorable spidey-sense that alerts him to people in danger (people he struggles to resist the compulsion to save), also has to deal with things like racism, relative poverty, being one of only a handful of black kids in an elite private school, keeping his grades up so he doesn't lose his scholarship, not succumbing to the pull of the streets when the financial going gets really tough, watching as people from his neighborhood DO succumb. This novel shows that every decision to save someone else is a decision to potentially wreck his own life. Because being a black superhero isn't the same as being a white one. The stakes are higher. Trying to keep this review spoiler-free but the villain here... MAN! Just immaculate. All I'll say is this: Jason has knocked it out of the park.

Please make this a series! \"Miles Morales\" is my first foray into the world of Jason Reynolds and I am now and will forever be a full time resident. This book is nothing short of exceptional. Despite being a fan of Peter Parker (and Spiderman in general), I never quite got around to reading about Miles. I knew of him via word of mouth, I know that this is a well-loved character but for some reason I never got into the comics. This novel is a great way to boost interest an a great way to do so in a potentially successful manner. Let's get into what I enjoyed about this book. The characters: Miles as a protagonist is beautifully crafted. Reynolds takes a lot of time developing Morales' central character traits and these are very well detailed on the page. It's easy to love Miles, and this novel creates the character in a more multidimensional way that comics and graphic novels are able to do. The supporting characters are equally well-drawn. The family and platonic relationships are fully developed, realities and very healthy. I believe it will be easy for students to identify themselves and their families within this book. The setting: Spiderman just has to be New York. This story might work elsewhere but I like that Reynold\u2019s kept with canon on this.The plot: This is the only downfall for me, but it\u2019s also a plus. Some readers will feel that this novel doesn\u2019t have much of a plot, it does. It\u2019s just that, for me, it feels like a something that\u2019s on a slow-cooker. You have to give it enough time to cook throughly. This is linked to the pacing, the pacing was perfect for the star that Reynold\u2019s is trying to tell and I do believe that it complements the book well. The romance is understated and as a secondary story-line acts as a strong compliment to Miles' story. This combination works extremely well and readers do not fell burdened to keep track. Moreover, I love that there are some many POC in this book. The diversity is truly representative and is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise homogenous genre. In summary, I believe that this novel is beautifully written and is definitely one of my favourite books for the year this far. I would recommend to everyone regardless of age, and would could be easily integrated into the curriculum of a literature class (even culture/history) if the teacher wants to shake this up a bit)."}, {"userName": "Chad", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25388909-chad", "userReview": "One of the worst books I've ever read. There is no plot or story. A Spider-Man book where nothing really happens except Miles goes to school for a week. We get no answers why this teacher is harassing Miles, why all these Mr. Chamberlains are targeting minority youths or why they are having the same dreams. The villain of the book is only in it for the last 20 pages. We get no resolution. Miles uses his powers in his civilian clothes to win a dance-off in a crowded subway car. Miles's dad is portrayed as an a-hole who acts like his child is a burden for most of the book. Oh, and find me one glass backboard at a public park in Brooklyn. They don't exist for the very same reason as in the book. Because kids break them dunking off them. The author is supposed to have grown up in Brooklyn. You'd think he would have paid attention to his surroundings.

The writing was... it was quite juvenile and even when this book has very little Spider-Man and there's a lot of description of Miles's life, I still didn't grasp completely who he was and what he wanted. He might have been the weakest character in this book. I also haaated Ganke. Goddamn, what an annoying character.I might have prefered watching this story as an animated 90 minutes movie, than experiencing it as a book.A bit of cringy moments here and there, because the dialogue was so... fanfiction-y, aand yeah. Maybe I'm just too old for this shit.I'm giving this 2 stars because like I said, it does try to explore important issues, like racial and social struggles, but because is quite juvenile, and the ending is sooo... ugh, I dunno, (extremely corny) comic booky, it fails to deliver a solid critic. Also, with Miles's background, there was a potential to make him one of the most complex heroes out there, but I just saw a lot of wasted opportunities, with the typical comic book romance trope and a weak, totally predictable, mess of a villain."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9314299-jessica", "userReview": "I loved this!

So, after watching Avengers: Infinity War I needed more Spider-Man. This is where Miles Morales was perfect. This was short, sweet and had a depth that carried through in a powerful sense. There was something lacking in this story, but it was overall, a really enjoyable read that highlighted family and friendship.Miles Morales is about Miles Morales. I know, unbelievable. Before this book has begun Miles is already Spider-Man, which I felt left us out of some of the most important things of his past. As the reader, we get snippets of that past but I really felt as if they were disconnected from the story and only used at times to try and push the story forward. Miles comes from a low-income family and is attending a boarding school on a full scholarship, he returns home every week to visit his mum and dad and I really loved that connection between them. However, being Spider-Man can cause some big, big problems. Mainly when you\u2019re sitting in class and your spidey senses go off and you run out, resulting in you being suspended. This isn\u2019t a one-time occurrence though, it is never-ending. Though it could just be because the teacher is a straight up racist and thinks slavery was great (literally, but this is challenged). Some of the story felt a little disjointed and I feel that was because the length made it difficult for the plot to really shine through and take hold. Which is unfortunate because this book had a lot of potential.I guess I should jump into my likes and dislikes before I start accidentally spoiling things!L I K E S\u2717 ACTION SCENE WELL DESCRIBEDThis is partially a dislike too, mainly because there is one action scene in the entire short book. However, it was perfectly described. I wish there had been more scenes like the finale one just because I was shocked. I have never read an action scene that was so perfectly described and allowed me to picture what was happening in clear detail.\u2717 THE DIALOGUE WAS GREATI\u2019m a big dialogue reader. I seriously rely on it to push a story forward. I\u2019m not sure why. Miles Morale had perfect dialogue for me. It was funny, it was fast paced and it all had a purpose, whether that was foreshadowing or not. The characters felt their age and they truly felt as if they had a depth throughout. I sincerely enjoyed it.D I S L I K E S\u2717 SO MUCH BUILD UP AND NOTHINGThe story builds and builds and builds and builds and\u2026nothing. The climax hits late in the book and its at a stage where you just don\u2019t really care anymore. The first 85% of the story was setting up for it but it didn\u2019t feel that way. It feels more so as if the author only remembered then that a problem needs to occur throughout the text in order for the bit to make a punch. It all came so late that I can barely remember what actually happened, my brain seems to have retained the knowledge of the dorm room description better.\u2717 SO MANY LOOSE ENDSMy biggest problem is how many loose ends this book has. It honestly feels like half a book, with the other half being cut out and the final edition not being edited properly. I really struggled once the book ended because it felt the biggest problem throughout was Miles and his uncles\u2019 relationship, but it\u2019s never actually talked about that much. It truly was just like what? When the book did finish. I just wanted more finality, not the open-ended kind of ending that was given.Overall, Miles Morales was a really good take on Spider-Man. I love Tom Holland, but now I wish that Marvel had taken the jump and made Spider-Man a person of colour in the newest remake. I just don\u2019t know how to feel about the book. I obviously enjoyed it for the most part but it was incredibly lacking in so many others. I wanted more and I, unfortunately, didn\u2019t get it. I guess my expectations were a little too high for this one."}, {"userName": "Rincey", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/278339-rincey", "userReview": "3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Ashley *Hufflepuff Kitten*", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29787548-ashley-hufflepuff-kitten", "userReview": "4.5 starsSolid execution and a great introduction (for me) to the character of Miles Morales.

The story is focused on his daily life, managing different parts of his identities and trying to figure out who he is.I enjoyed reading the novel. It felt more like a contemporary than a Marvel story. Undoubtedly, Miles is Super Hero and he does help people and fight bad guys, but I felt the focus was on his daily life, on studying at school, on relationships with his parents, his best friend Ganke and his crush Alicia. I liked it because I like well-written contemporaries with complex characters.This is my first encounter with Miles and I really like the kid, I want to read more stories about him. He has a heart of gold and he's unafraid to act and make decisions. One of his internal conflicts is about his relationship with his late uncle and whether or not Miles is the same as he. I do enjoy reading the stories dealing with dilemma of what makes us our blood or our choices.As it's a Marvel story, there has to be a villain or antagonist to the protagonist.The villains of the story are white supremacists, racists and Confederate supporters, who want to bring back \"the good old days\".

He's such a great Spiderman - kind, earnest, and doing his absolute best. - I loved Reynold's portrayal of him - a kid from a working class family who bears the weight of his parents' expectations and society's expectations - a portrayal that shows great understanding and does Miles' identity justice. - Though the book doesn't really have a 'plot', the story highlights important themes and issues such as race, systemic oppression, identity, and family - this part, for me, was 4 stars.- However, I just did not enjoy the 'villain' subplot... at all. I felt like it detracted from the quality of the overall book, because Miles' ordinary life is great and interesting in itself, but anytime the narrative focused on the villain, I felt bored and uninterested.- I was also disappointed by the resolution of the villain - we also don't receive much explanation as to who or what the villain is. I understand that the villain may be symbolic, but the resolution and 'reveal' was unsatisfying.- The ending, however, was good. It was more open-ended than I'd usually like for an ending, but I think it offered an interesting question about Miles and his character, and where he will go from the ending."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15870923-christy", "userReview": "One of my favorite booksellers described this book as 25% Spider-Man and 75% Jason Reynolds, which is completely accurate. I absolutely LOVED Miles Morales and can't recommend it enough. What Jason does to transform the history and legacy of Miles in just 272 short pages is incredible. Miles is a 15 year old black-Puerto Rican youth with a whole lot going on and, oh, he also has the same powers as Spider-Man. The old mantra \"with great power comes great responsibility\" sounds great except when you're trying to keep your grades up at your all-white private school and the world is working against you. Miles has to worry about his parents and his neighborhood far before he will be saving the world, a lesson his dad shares with him at the very beginning of the story. To say I loved the family dynamics in this story is an understatement.Without spoiling the story, I have to tell you...The villain in this story? Jason knocked it out of the park and hit home on our current world. Miles doesn't have all the privileges we see in typical superhero stories, which makes his story compelling and true.

I do appreciate that Miles' parents are involved in his life and trying to instill in him to be the very best he can be. I appreciate that his father punished him for being suspended by making him give back to his community. I appreciate that they have a healthy relationship with both each other and Miles. I just really appreciate the entire family aspect of this novel. One of my main gripes is that I predicted what was going on and who the villain was fairly early on. For someone as smart as Miles, I was kinda baffled that it took him as long as it did to figure out what was going on.But overall, this was a solid read.

Something important to note, I got to read it because a friend got it at BEA/BookCon and lent it to me. ALSO IMPORTANT, I love Spider-Man, full stop. He's always been one of my favorite superheroes ever since I was a kid, so to read a book about Spider-Man and Miles Morales?? Yes?? Of course, please, thank you.Jason Reynolds has given Miles so much voice in this book and it's such a joy to read. Miles and Ganke have this exuberant friendship and you know that they'll be there for each other no matter what comes their way. The same goes for Miles and his parents. The villain in this book is so much bigger than one person and every time Miles learned more about why his spidey senses were going off, I had chills. I don't want to give anything major away about it, but, yeah, chills. The fight scenes were fast, fun, and Miles has some good taunts that you'd expect from Spider-Man (at least I did, haha.) Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I highly recommend it to everyone. It's a quick read, yet full of characterization and heart and greatness (which of course comes with responsibility). Even if you're saying, \"Oh I don't really like superhero books, random reviewer on GR,\" TRUST ME!! This book is one you won't put down.

I can tell you that I still have a pronounced lack of enthusiasm for superheroes, but Miles Morales is proof that these spandex-clad men still have interesting stories to be told, as long as you have socially-conscious, talented authors like Jason Reynolds telling them.Let me tell you the two big things this story got right for the non-superhero reader like me:1. It skipped the origin storyOkay so it doesn't skip it entirely, but it is only mentioned in flashbacks. I don't really care how the kid got his superpowers, nor do I think it makes for a compelling story (At its most basic level, it's an anecdote about getting pinched by a bug. Pretty boring). I don't care about where his suit came from, or his web shooters, or how he learned how to climb on walls and use his spidey sense. Spider-Man is a cultural icon at this point, we know he has all these abilities, and we know they are a part of the character. They just aren't the interesting parts of the character. Even the schmoes like me know about all that stuff, and Reynolds deftly avoids the origin story tropes by choosing to tell a different story entirely.2. 95% of the book is about a kid and his conflicts, not about face punching and city destructionI often forgot this was even a Spider-Man book as I was reading it, and for me, that is a positive. Miles, his parents, Ganke, Alicia, Austin, the Chamberlains, hell even the librarian are all interesting characters on their own, and all interact with Miles in different ways that create the conflicts of the story that any teen, really any person can relate to. Miles has to deal with the pressure of doing right by his family and his community since he is one of the few kids in his neighborhood to go to a prestigious academy. He also has to do right by himself and his own dignity whenever Mr. Chamberlain tries to muzzle him like a dog. And on top of that he also get to know Alicia the love interest because she is beautiful yes, but also because of who she is as a person. All of this is compelling, and Reynolds even subtlety weaves in commentary about race and social issues in the U.S.For the most part. (Ahoy, spoilers ahead!)Not even the amazing Spider-Man can escape all of the superhero cliches. This villain, whew, let me tell you. Not only does he do the big bombastic \"NOW I WILL EXPLAIN MY EVIL PLAN TO PEOPLE WHO ALREADY KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR NO REASON\" speech towards the end of the book, this guy literally wants to subjugate black people like they did in the confederacy and even has an evil white cat that sits on his lap while he conjures up his diabolical schemes. And yes, the cat shows up in Miles' dreams throughout the book to hint at what this villain may be up to. I hate that cliche too. When was the last time one of your dreams ever helped you solve a problem in your real life? Cause they sure as hell haven't in my life. My dreams are nonsensical and loud and usually involve me taking a math test that I of course haven't studied for and my only way out of it is to drive a monster truck into the ocean and meet up with Rod Stewart so we can open up a gastropub with the money we earned mining moon rocks. Boy, I wish all my dreams would reveal all my secret enemies and perhaps hint at where to find them to destroy them, then maybe tell me the winning lotto numbers while they're at it.Rant aside, I'm not going to take too many points away from a good book for having a cheesy villain. I was thinking that the bad guy was a bit too cartoonish until I remembered that Richard Spencer exists, and now I'm not sure if I'm living in reality or maybe we're all in one giant dream. Well if it is all a dream, Miles Morales has made it much more tolerable. Anyway, does anybody have a pencil I can borrow? I didn't realize we had a math test today."}, {"userName": "MissFabularian", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2060082-missfabularian", "userReview": "Miles Morales is a highly anticipated and thoroughly engrossing story to add to the Spiderman franchise. I am highly convinced that Jason Reynolds can do no wrong when it comes to writing intriguing tales that provoke conversation and this novel proves it.

Does he choose to live the ordinary life of a young man, or will his sense of responsibility to his community shape his destiny. I read this book in one day. Couldn't put it down. I loved the poetic aspects, deep character exploration, and family dynamics in the story. I really loved how Mr. Reynolds blended the superhero narrative with a social commentary on the importance of mental fortification for young boys of color."}, {"userName": "Silvia ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58358583-silvia", "userReview": "I\u2019m truly disappointed with this book! Nothing happens throughout the whole book! Some very good plots happen but without any resolution. Miles uses his powers to win a dance off in a train and that\u2019s about as much spider action as we get. The only reason I have two stars is because I love the concept of Spider-Man (more like spider boy in this book) being black and puertorrique\u00f1o."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14035448-carol", "userReview": "I received an advance copy from the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an unbiased review.Whether you're familiar with Miles Morales as Spider-Man or not, this book really does have something for everyone.

And Miles knew hustling was in his veins.\" Miles Morales is just your average teenager. Dinner every Sunday with his parents, chilling out playing old-school video games with his best friend, Ganke, crushing on brainy, beautiful poet Alicia. He's even got a scholarship spot at the prestigious Brooklyn Visions Academy. Oh yeah, and he's Spider Man.But lately, Miles's spidey-sense has been on the fritz. When a misunderstanding leads to his suspension from school, Miles begins to question his abilities. After all, his dad and uncle were Brooklyn jack-boys with criminal records. Maybe kids like Miles aren't meant to be superheroes. Maybe Miles should take his dad's advice and focus on saving himself.As Miles tries to get his school life back on track, he can't shake the vivid nightmares that continue to haunt him. Nor can he avoid the relentless buzz of his spidey-sense every day in history class, amidst his teacher's lectures on the historical \"benefits\" of slavery and the modern-day prison system. But after his scholarship is threatened, Miles uncovers a chilling plot, one that puts his friends, his neighborhood, and himself at risk.It's time for Miles to suit up.", "title": "Miles Morales\n      \n          (\u0412\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f Marvel)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32793053-miles-morales", "average": 3.93, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1495746889l/32793053.jpg", "reviews": 603, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1229281.Jason_Reynolds", "name": "Jason Reynolds"}], "type": ["Young Adult", "Fantasy", "Comics", "Fiction", "Childrens"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32793053-miles-morales", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35218652-miles-morales", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36234028-miles-morales", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25657130-all-american-boys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22552026-long-way-down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28954126-ghost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21490991-the-boy-in-the-black-suit", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17428880-when-i-was-the-greatest", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9409759-powers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider"]}
