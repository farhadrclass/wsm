When I first started reading Perfectly Undone, for the first third of the book actually, I wasn\u2019t into it at all. I didn\u2019t particularly like Dylan, or her obsession with righting a supposed wrong from years ago. The martyr is one of my least favorite characters. The characters were very flat and one-dimensional. I didn\u2019t find them interesting, and it was hard to care about them. However, somewhere around the middle of the book, I suddenly couldn\u2019t put it down. I honestly didn\u2019t know how it was going to end. The characters became unpredictable, but in a very credible, realistic, human way. I wasn\u2019t sure what their actions and reactions would be, and I discovered, to my surprise, I had become emotionally invested in them. Their actions and reactions, the choices they made, especially the poor choices, gave the characters life. There are several themes that ensure it won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, (cheating, for example), but I thought the flaws and mistakes made the characters more human and believable. They were more interesting, and real. I thought the parallels between Dylan\u2019s life and two other couples were a tad heavy-handed, and her mentor a cultural stereotype, but overall, I really enjoyed this book."}, {"userName": "Theresa Alan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3268839-theresa-alan", "userReview": "Dr. Dylan Michaels is a successful OB/GYN with a loving and supportive man in her life.

I\u2019ll be honest and say that after reading about a quarter of it I nearly gave up. I recommend you keep going, it does improve!The main character is Dr Dylan Michels and the story starts with her turning down her boyfriend\u2019s marriage proposal, even though she loves him. She\u2019s filled with guilt and self-loathing over something in her past and until she comes to terms with that she\u2019ll never really find happiness. The story explores her past and present, giving insights into her life and feelings through the first person narrative story.It is a story of life, where people make mistakes that they regret but that, when they learn from their mistakes, they can move on. Sometimes, however, forgiving yourself is the hardest thing to do. The secondary characters obviously also contribute the the main character\u2019s development and have significant roles to play as they learn that to err is human and no one is absolutely perfect all the time.I requested and received a copy of this novel, via NetGalley.

Though it was undemanding it still had plenty of meat, it explored some below the surface things like the constant balance many women struggling with between having a successful career AND a personal life and how important forgiveness can be, especially when we let ourselves off the hook. It also dealt with fidelity, trust and guilt and just how much these issues can effect a person. There was a strong feeling of authenticity to this book, both in the authors writing style and the characters she created. Dylan was really easy to relate to, her struggles were common even if the circumstances she experienced were unique. It was one of those debuts where you think, no way is this their first book, the writing is so solid! Raintree is definitely an author I\u2019ll follow closely, she has a keen ability to craft excellent characters that you grow to care about.This would be a fantastic choice for a book club as there are definitely many things that could be explored and discussed. As an added bonus there are some really awesome questions in the readers guide at the back of the book too!

Tragedy hasn\u2019t been kind to this family and their healing is a long time coming. Dylan seems to be the one who suffers the most, but we don\u2019t always know our family as well as we think we do.Cooper and Stephen are best friends made even more so when Cooper\u2019s sister marries Stephen. Cooper, Stephen and Dylan supported each other through medical school, but will their adult lives withstand their future?I wasn\u2019t sure I liked Dr. Dylan Michels at first. She seemed callused and hardened by her past, unable to love those who love her. By the end of the book I understood because she eventually became the woman she was meant to be.I adored Cooper. It was easy to forgive him for his faults because he was so in love with Dylan. As the outsider looking in, I could see why he erred, and I rooted for him even when I was dead set against his actions.Dylan\u2019s family reflects her way of distancing herself from others. I so wanted to point them in the right direction as the pain was evident. Cooper\u2019s family seems so pulled together even when they\u2019re not. It was a tug of war watching them all come \u201cperfectly undone\u201d.The emotion in this book is raw and uncensored. Those who have lost a child, or have been the victim of infidelity may find this book extremely hard to experience. For me, I felt it dealt with life\u2019s worst moments in a raw, engaging manner, eventually concluding in beauty. This book will make you cry when you least expect it. In the end, it\u2019s a joyful cry so it\u2019s well worth the sensitive journey.There is so much passion within these pages that it stirs something deep inside in appreciation. Gardeners will appreciate Reese and his wisdom. He epitomizes the philosophy of gardening as a healer of fresh wounds.There are a lot of repetitive ideas and circumstances in this book, but I didn\u2019t realize how much so until I looked back on them in the end. In truth, don\u2019t we all repeat the mistakes of others and connect because of it? The web is deep in this story and with it the pain is like shards of glass. It\u2019s the rare author who has me immediately looking for another book by her to read. Jamie Raintree is a rare find.Gifted in her approach to weaving an emotive story full of interesting characters you will love for all their faults and goodness, Jamie Raintree sucked me right in until the end. PERFECTLY UNDONE is gripping family drama that will tie you to your chair anxiously turning the pages. I can\u2019t wait for the next book excerpted at the end of this one.

She has been in a relationship with her boyfriend, Cooper, for nine years but she has always held back from fully commiting to it. She harbours a secret from her teenage years that she has never talked about to anyone. After the death of her sister, Abby, from an undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy Dyan decides to go into medicine in the hopes of helping other pregnant woman. This consumes her life. She spends hours at the hospital with a large caseload as well as trying to get a grant for a study implementing better prenatal care. Cooper is becoming increasingly frustrated with her as she seems to be pulling away from him and withdrawing more and more into her work. As he pushes her to prioritize their relationship Dylan has to take a hard look at herself and decide what she wants and where she is going with her life. She realizes she has to face the secret that has been holding her hostage all these years.

I requested this back in the summer and I received it at the beginning of September (and by that point I completely forgot I requested the book). So it was quite the surprise the find this package on my doorstep. *Note: There are going to be some spoilers ahead. You\u2019ve been warned.* I have quite mixed feelings on this book, so I really have no idea what to think of it. On one hand, I appreciated for the book for what it was. But another part of me wanted to LOVE this book. I really did like the book, and I do believe that other people (who are much older than me specifically) will appreciate this book more than I did. I\u2019m in my very early 20s and the main character is in her late 20s/early 30s so with that huge age gap, I didn\u2019t truly appreciate and/or relate to her character. This book was not in my demographic so as a result, I was very much let down from this book. But I still think other readers will love this book more than I did.To be honest, I wanted this book to go in a completely different direction than it did. The certain decisions Dylan made, I just didn\u2019t approve of. Like, when she actually goes back to Cooper in the end, I was done (like what the fuck? You don\u2019t just forgive someone after they cheat on you AFTER being in a nine-year relationship with them). I personally thought this book was going be a self-discovery book about Dylan coming to terms with her sister\u2019s death and finding herself after the end of a long-term relationship. Unfortunately that\u2019s not what I got, and I was a little disappointed.I was mainly frustrated with Dylan because, I felt her decisions were influenced by other people and not herself. People were telling her: \u201cyou should get back together with him,\u201d \u201cyou guys are meant to be\u201d amongst other things. Like she\u2019s a grown woman, so I think she has the capability of making her own decisions. But she also doesn\u2019t make the greatest decisions herself (hence forgiving Cooper when she clearly shouldn\u2019t have). So just her inability to make a decision really pissed me off.What I appreciated about the book was the familial relationship with Dylan and her parents. I thought it was well done and it kept me reading. This type of relationship represented in the book is very similar to my own relationship with my family (especially towards the end). I say this because my sibling is very well and alive so there\u2019s no grieving in that sense. But it\u2019s more along of the lines of grieving our former lives and how each of my family members have been affected by the notion of this loss.I also enjoyed her writing style but I did find the pacing to be rather slow at times. The story was descriptive so I really got the sense of where this character was for the duration of the book (which is always a good thing when you\u2019re reading,\ud83d\ude02). As for reading more of her books, I actually would like to see what else this author will write as this is her debut novel.Overall, I appreciated certain parts of this book for what they were, but this just wasn\u2019t in my demographic. However, I really do think other people would enjoy this book a lot more than I did. I will be reading her future books just to see how she takes on other stories. I liked the book, I just didn\u2019t love it as much as I thought.Review is also on: NicoleHendersonReads"}, {"userName": "Grace {Rebel Mommy Book Blog}", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39472009-grace-rebel-mommy-book-blog", "userReview": "This review was originally posted on Rebel Mommy Book Blog"}, {"userName": "Trina Burgermeister", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56960093-trina-burgermeister", "userReview": "Having worked in a school of medicine, I have seen many women M.D.s/ PH.D.s driven to this kind of near-neurotic quest for perfection, so loved the idea of being given a more intimate (even if fictional!) look at what they go through to achieve such heights. I found Dr. Dylan Michals a very believable (though at times not very likeable!) character - and that's part of what made her ring so true for me! The very real treatment of her foibles and shortcomings as well as her brilliant achievements!!I also found Dylan's family after the loss of her big sister to be true to form as well. The family in fact was one of my favorite parts of this novel - the deeply flawed, scared and real characters and yet, at the end, when Dylan takes the leap of faith (and donned her gardening gloves to work through the pain and loss in her past) and begins the hard work toward repairing family relationships, I liked her even more.I loved Cooper - and his family, especially his sister! The challenges he faces with Dylan, though some of his own making, are believable in such a gut-wrenching way. I found Ms. Raintree's writing to be genuine, engaging and well-researched.

Maybe if I could forget my past, I\u2019d finally get a hold on my future.\u201dDr. Dylan Michels has it all. A fantastic job doing what she loves, the chance to further her career and her research to help save women, and an amazing boyfriend who is there for her no matter how hard she works. So, when he proposes, why does she go running into the rain?We know up front that Dylan is obsessed with her grant research, and her career, because of her sister\u2019s death. We don\u2019t know how exactly she died, only that Dylan somehow feels responsible for it. And her entire family relationship is centered around this loss. She is distant from her mother, who also holds on to Abby as much as Dylan, but they can\u2019t grieve together. Her father and brother share their grief, but only on the anniversary date, so while on the surface they seem close, it also feels more frail than it appears.And then there\u2019s Cooper. Her boyfriend of 9 years. The man who loves and her accepts her and is always rooting for her. Even when her life hasn\u2019t settled into the one he hoped for. He has the family she wants, and couldn\u2019t think of life without him. Which is partly why she drove me a little crazy.Here\u2019s the thing about Dylan: I didn\u2019t particularly like her. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I understood her, where her character was coming from, the determination to right a perceived wrong. But she drove me crazy. She was so unaware of herself and her actions. I found it maddening that she expected everyone to be so understanding of her actions, even when she did nothing to explain them, but then refused to give other people the same courtesy. I found her to be a little self-absorbed and very immature, the her hypocrisy made me want to throw the book more than once.If turmoil and bad choices aren\u2019t your thing, you\u2019re probably going to be in for a disappointment. These characters are a symphony of poor communication. Of assuming that the choices you make in order to protect other people, or because you think you know what they\u2019re thinking, are always the right choices. This dance of missed opportunities is done throughout the book in multiple relationships, and really drives home the important of being open and honest with the ones you love. There is a certain Shakespearean elegance, (or perhaps it\u2019s more Greek tragedy), to the relationships and how they develop (or fall apart) in this novel.In this regard, it struck me over and over, how unfair and immature Dylan was being. She listens to people complain about people behaving a certain way in their lives, and even has those same issues with others, but completely fails to recognize it in her own self. And, when it comes to one rough spot, albeit a very bad rough spot, she simply shuts down and freezes everyone out. It\u2019s difficult to go into the specifics without giving away spoilers. But, I can say, for a character who is told how perceptive she is to the needs of her patients, it\u2019s amazing how little she lacks that same ability in her personal life. Or rather, she has it, she just simply doesn\u2019t want to face it.\u201cI realize I may have pushed things too far. Maybe I didn\u2019t want to hear his side, because it would bring me to this moment: facing the ugly truth. I\u2019ve always known I was keeping Cooper at a distance, but I hoped he didn\u2019t notice.\u201dMaybe that\u2019s the point. Maybe that\u2019s how we are in real life. We all probably have the most difficultly seeing how we truly behave with others. And it\u2019s hard to face the ugly truths about ourselves. When things aren\u2019t personal, we are able to relax and follow what we know to be right and true. But when our hearts get in the way, our heads seem to short-circuit.Of course, unlike Shakespeare, or the Greeks, this story doesn\u2019t end in tragedy, or, at least not the tragedy you expect. This story is more about forgiveness, and all that word encompasses. Forgiving others, but especially forgiving our selves. And I did like how the author led the conclusion of that forgiveness down several different paths for the characters. Sometimes forgiveness means letting go. And sometimes it doesn\u2019t.Not liking the main character aside, I did enjoy this book. I find that books that make me really think and identify with what makes me uncomfortable are often some of the most satisfying books. I also find that people aren\u2019t always likable, so why do we always expect that of the characters within our books? Even if I don\u2019t want to be BFF\u2019s with the characters in the pages, it made me think and feel and examine my reactions deeper than just the surface. And that\u2019s worth reading.This complexity makes it, I think, the absolute perfect book for the November book club pick. There is substance and depth to each of the characters. Not to mention, quite a few issues to keep conversation interesting; such as guilt, lies, secrets to just name a few.Thank you to BookSparks for sending me a copy to read and review as part of FRC2017!"}, {"userName": "Olivia Farr", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8488828-olivia-farr", "userReview": "\"Perfectly Undone\" was a really fantastic novel about forgiveness and moving on. Daryl is an OB/Gyn, finishing her residency and applying for grants, while somewhat balancing her relationship with Cooper, who is a pediatrician and already done with his residency. Although both of them had been in the same place for so long, Cooper is now to the next step with regular hours and an interest in settling down with the rest of his life. The first chapter is his proposal and her declining of it. We then go back in time to trace the weeks leading up to this event and then the aftermath.I was absolutely gripped from the get-go. Although this wasn't a thriller, Daryl's life is pretty intense. We get glimpses into her family, her patients, and her personal history of relationships with Cooper and her family that set the stage for her current state. Daryl was a three-dimensional character, and she felt a little like all of us- trying to have it all, striving for unattainable perfection, carrying around guilt and judgments. The people around her are equally as flawed. We see mistakes from Cooper (who often seems too perfect to be human), his sister/her husband, and Dylan's parents. The way that they all evolve throughout the book is fascinating. The author really invites us into their lives and gives the perfect amount of context and events to allow us to become really emotionally invested in every character's story. It was nearly impossible to put this book down once I started reading, and I was absolutely enthralled the whole way through.One of the most interesting albeit least developed characters was the gardener/landscape architect, Reese. The garden and landscape architect served as a focal point for much of Dylan's thinking and revelations. It really sets the stage for a lot of deeper meaning and thinking. I found his role to be incredibly intriguing and really like the way he was left mostly to the imagination and did not fill much beyond his purpose in terms of Dylan's development. It was a really interesting way to create him and I found it portrayed his role perfectly. The writing style was absolutely amazing and the book was put together so well, I felt I understood Dylan on a very deep level, and I was incredibly emotionally invested in her story. Notably, this book wasn't a light, beachy read, as it deals with some very intense themes, including infidelity, unexpected death, secrets, and ultimately forgiveness and love. However, I absolutely enjoyed the book and felt that the ending resolutions were perfect even if not always perfectly happy. Overall, this was a fantastic read, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys women's fiction, stories of redemption, and second chances.Please note that I received an ARC from the publisher.

But when he does, Dylan says no. Huh?For years she has been living with guilt \u2013 the part she played in her sister\u2019s death. But her entire facade of being the perfect daughter, perfect partner and perfect doctor hasn\u2019t silenced that haunting thought.Ironically, it\u2019s Cooper who makes a life changing confession, before Dylan has the chance to tell her secret. Is their so-called perfect life about to come undone? Sometimes you find yourself in the most surprising places.Writing about forgiveness and family secrets is difficult, but Jamie is able to create a sensitive narrative without clich\u00e9. Her prose is sharp, focused and the characters become pretty good friends by the end.Jamie recently was interviewed by Tall Poppies online book club, BLOOM. She offers advise for aspiring authors. \u201cIf your goal is to build a career as a writer, treat your writing like a career from the get-go. In order for people to take you seriously as a writer\u2014your family, your friends, an agent, a publisher, and most importantly, yourself\u2014you have to take your writing seriously.\u201dHere\u2019s the full interview.https://tallpoppies.org/tuesday-chat-...Jamie Raintree is a voracious student of life, which is why she became a writer, where she could put all that acquired information to good use. She is a mother of two, a wife, a businesswoman, a nature-lover, and a wannabe yogi. She also teaches writers about business and productivity. Since the setting is always an important part of her books, she is happy to call the Rocky Mountains of Northern Colorado her home and inspiration."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5126937-amy", "userReview": "Do you ever read a book in which the narrator is so frustrating that you wish she were real so that you could shout at her to just STOP?Well, I have. And it's this book.Dylan is an OB-GYN who has what looks like the perfect life. Her boyfriend Cooper, a fellow physician, loves her. He adores her. He wants to marry her. And in response, she takes off and wanders around in the rain.Not that Cooper is without fault. He even discloses a painful one to Dylan. He shows his love, though. He hires a landscape architect to design a garden area for her that he knows will make her happy, and he adopts a puppy because he knows she is a good caretaker. Dylan, though, doesn't see that. She's too busy hating her mother and holding herself responsible for her sisters's death years ago.Dylan, you might say, is tiresome.Yet she's also someone you hope will figure herself out and find happiness. She's clearly a good doctor, and when she suffers losses - both significant and insignificant - you can see that she is someone who leads with her heart. Unfortunately, she can't be honest with Cooper about what stops her from saying yes to him.Jamie Raintree uses the garden as a symbol of Dylan and Cooper's relationship and even of Dylan herself. Sometimes you need to set nature free, and sometimes you need to prune it a little. Regardless, you have to embrace its inherent beauty and flaws. You have to recognize that perfection is in the eye of the beholder."}, {"userName": "Cher Green", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4233203-cher-green", "userReview": "I won an advance copy of Perfectly Undone through Jamie Raintree\u2019s newsletter.I don\u2019t normally read this type of book. My normal go-to reads are crime or thrillers. But when, I heard Jamie was about to break through into the publishing world, I was extremely excited for her. I entered the giveaway, not really expecting to win, but thank goodness I did. I\u2019m really not sure if I would have grabbed a copy otherwise.Jamie Raintree is an excellent author, and her story Perfectly Undone ripped my heart out. Dylan has a secret, something she can\u2019t tell anyone, not even her best friend/boyfriend, Cooper. Her determination to right her own wrong drives a wedge between her and those who love her the most. But, when Cooper betrays her, the whole world collapses around her - one piece at a time. Perfectly Undone is a story of falling apart and then coming back stronger than before. I recommend this book to most readers of women\u2019s literature, and to anyone who has felt the pain of being cheated on, or have experience the tug of war between career and relationship."}, {"userName": "Tasha Seegmiller", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/999035-tasha-seegmiller", "userReview": "There has been a bit of buzz ahead of Jamie Raintree's debut.It's deserved. In this contemporary novel, Raintree weaves in the complications that occur in someone when they have a traumatic moment in the past and a passion to make the future make up for it. Dylan was a character who I liked almost immediately, and watching her work through the passion for her career, the disappointments, the complications she faces in her personal relationships, and discoveries about the real dangers of keeping secrets. The imagery - especially of the backyard - pulled me deeper into the story, and I found Raintree handled the intimate moments of this book - both physical and professional - with grace. I devoured this book and will absolutely be reading Jamie Raintree's next."}, {"userName": "Jennie Shaw", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8181718-jennie-shaw", "userReview": "I have mixed feelings about PERFECTLY UNDONE, and wavered between giving it three or four stars. For me, it came down to my connection with Dylan, which came and went multiple times. While the plot certainly had surprises, Dylan's reactions were frustrating. Emotional growth is a key component for contemporary women's fiction and while it happened, I feel there was more emphasis on her starting point (and subsequent actions that reinforced her beliefs). I also found the male characters to be fairly unrealistic, delivering pitch-perfect dialogue at all times. The writing itself was beautiful and I definitely saw the world through Dylan's eyes. Now that I've finished, I suspect I may not be the target audience for this book, but avid readers of women's fiction who love truly getting inside a character's head and appreciate a realistically driven plot will find it very satisfying.
