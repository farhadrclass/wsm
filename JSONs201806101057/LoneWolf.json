I've read 13 of them, most of which were thoroughly enjoyable (with only a couple of notable exceptions--Songs of the Humpback Whale for one). I'm always excited to see when she's written something new and can't wait for it to come into print. When I've read or listened to interviews she's given, I am always amazed that she writes all of her novels in about 9 months. For the most part, you would never be able to tell they are written so quickly.However, Lone Wolf was the exception. Not only was this book not enjoyable, it was physically painful to read. It was one of those books that you read 150 pages in, decide you don't really like the book, but feel like you have to finish it just because you've already put so much effort into reading it. To me, it feels like she just didn't have enough time to really get at the heart of the novel. The characters were underdeveloped, the voices stagnant, and the plot unrealistic. One of my favorite things about reading a novel by Picoult is her use of voice. In this novel however, the voices of each character were so similar as to be indistinguishable from one another. If there weren't names at the beginning of each chapter, I would have said this was a first person omnicient narrator. Furthermore, the plot was at times contrived and at other times wholly unrealistic. The \"surprise\" ending was so poorly done that it was truly unbelievable. The only redeeming quality of the book, for me, was the information about wolves. I found her research to be fascinating and wished more could have been incorporated about them. I didn't enjoy this book. But I do love other novels by Jodi Picoult and would recommend many of them. Hopefully, the next novel will be better than Lone Wolf."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6920258-katie", "userReview": "I was pretty disappointed with this book. To be honest though, I thought the same when I read the excerpt Jodi Picoult published months (maybe even a year) ago on her website. But I gave the book a chance because Ms Picoult is one of my favorite authors. I guess the main problem with the book is that, unlike her previous books, the characters in \"Lone Wolf\" are boring and stale. Jodi Picoult's books are known for their intricate plots and well-developed characters. Her story-lines are typically not so predictable as this one. From the beginning of the book, you can basically tell how it will end. The characters in \"Lone Wolf\" are hardly developed. Usually her characters are complicated and are intertwined with each other in so many ways and angles. For example, Picoult gives a little information for the character of Helen Bedd. She provides a \"cute\" explanation to the origin of her name (mainly I think because she heard it in a joke and wanted to throw it in) and has her briefly interact with both Cara and Edward - meetings with no impact to the story. Her \"appearance\" in court reads like a letter - the character doesn't actually \"speak\" to the judge. No other information is given. If Helen Bedd was given more of a background and role in the story, she wouldn't be such a throw-away character. Unfortunately, her main characters are not much better.  It seems to have been hurriedly put together with not much thought. The original plot is intriguing but Picoult does little to expand on the idea. And that's a shame because she is an excellent writer. The first word that comes to my mind when I think of \"Lone Wolf\" is \"half-assed.\""}, {"userName": "Nenette", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156661-nenette", "userReview": "Whatever type of drama-family, medical, courtroom, even wild animal drama...this book has them all, with Jodi Picoult's signature all over it. \u00a0It may be that her books has a certain mould, a template, but she gets published only once or twice a year so if you're like me who waits to read the latest, you can liken it to waiting for Christmas.There's always something new to learn in her books. In Lone Wolf, there was of course the wolf lessons, both about them and from them. \u00a0There were the briefs on the law. \u00a0Most importantly, there were family and relationship lessons.I highly recommend this to anybody who is willing to listen and to feel; to those who highly value their familial relationships; to those who have at one time or another have walked out of his pack, but who have found and earned his way back."}, {"userName": "guiltlessreader", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/640565-guiltlessreader", "userReview": "This is one of those books where I started doubting if the whole wolf allegory would mess up the storytelling ... But it was an essential part of the whole reading experience. Amazing piece by Picoult. Full review coming soon!-------------Originally posted on my blog Guiltless ReadingJodi Picoult's powerful stories are not new to me. So when I saw that her latest novel Lone Wolf was up for grabs in Goodreads, I didn't think twice. And so I was among the lucky ones who got an Advanced Reader Copy!My thoughts: The story revolves around a man who was in an accident, lying comatose in the hospital. That man is Luke Warren, a passionate zoologist, who had put his \"human\" life on hold and went to live among the wolves in the wild. He had returned to an alienated wife and two kids, Edward and Cara. Georgie divorced Luke and made a new life for herself, marrying a lawyer and starting a new family. Cara stayed on with her father. Edward fled the country, and his family.Now faced with medical decisions needing to be made, Edward, the prodigal son, returns at the request of his mother. Seventeen-year-old Cara, figured in the same accident as her father, but escaped with only minor injuries.The story revolves around the difficult decisions that family members must wrestle with, in their lives together, and their future together. The already strained dynamics of a family in crisis becomes a legal battle as each one believes they know what's best in the interest of Luke Warren. Moral and legal questions come to fore: Who should make critical medical decisions - someone who is legally of age, or who knows that person's wishes better? Who determines when to cut off life support? What if the patient wants to donate their organs?The book's chapters shift with the characters, with first-person viewpoints, making for very interesting reading. You''ll hear it from Georgie, Cara, Edward, and from Luke himself. You'll notice this through the change in font type (which I must point out is quite annoying to read), the tone of voice, and simply the whole difference in perspectives.The story comes to a dramatic and tragic close, with family members coming out better for the experience. ***Ok, so now for the wolf part. The title intrigued me. The cover looked rather literal, but I figured it would have a metaphorical treatment. I was pleasantly surprised that the use of wolves was both literal and metaphorical. And that is what I feel has made this book stand apart. Jodi Picoult based her story on a true story, that of renowned wolf researcher Shaun Ellis, also known as the Wolfman. His research has fed into Luke Warren's accounts of his life with wolves, from the science-y side as well as from the vulnerable human side. I have been asked many times what made me choose this path in life. I think part of it was that animals have always been straight with me, but humans haven\u2019t. But the other part is that I don\u2019t take no for an answer very easily. - p. 60 (page may change), ARC of Lone Wolf Picoult has a tender way of drawing parallelisms between wolves and humans - insights about family, loyalty, and other distinctly traits we come to think as human - which made me wonder at how complicated we've made our lives.  There's an honesty to the wolf world that is liberating. There's no diplomacy, no decorum. You tell your enemy you hate him; you show your admiration by confessing the truth. That directness doesn't work with humans, who are masters of subterfuge. Does this dress make me look fat? Do you really love me? Do you miss me? When a person asks this, she really doesn't want to now the real answer. She wants you to lie to her. After two years of living with wolves. I had forgotten how many lies it takes to build a relationship. - p. 342-343 (pages may change), ARC of Lone Wolf I learned so much about humanity through wolves. Quite amazing to accomplish through a book!Verdict: Amazing piece by Picoult. Beautiful, powerful storytelling about family life. Be prepared for the insights about wolf life; the whole wolf allegory is essential part of the whole reading experience."}, {"userName": "Leeann", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1901024-leeann", "userReview": "Eh. Just Meh. Jodi, Jodi, Jodi.. I know you don't write just for me. But my heart is breaking a little bit.You used to be my favorite author. I bought your books, even in hardback, which is a rare thing for this frugal girl to do.Sight unseen, I'd buy them, because I just knew they would be good.About four books back or so, I began to feel they were becoming formulaic.The twists were predictable, the tearjerkers at the end became cheap and redundant.I hoped for more. I still believed.With these last two books, though, my belief is fading.You've been relegated to being an author I put on reserve at the library.I still get excited, and hopeful, but in the end I'm usually just glad I didn't spend twenty-five bucks for the read.I miss you, Jodi, and I think you've still got it.

Not the mom or the stepfather or the brother or the sister.I did enjoy the parts about Luke, which surprised me b/c I expected to like those parts the least.It's my understanding from seeing reviews on Amazon that this book was not well researched and wolf-lovers are all up-in-arms about the lack of research and correct wolf information. I don't know enough about wolves to have an opinion on this issue.This is not a book I would want to pick up and read again.

Her books are easy to read quickly and involve family dynamics. She always seems to do a lot of research on a wide range of topics in order to bring controversial issues into her books to keep them a little more cerebral than other chic lit authors. However, the subject matter in this book was intangible for me. A guy who preferred living with the wolves than with his wife and two kids? It seemed far fetched and a unrealistic. First, why would a woman want to be with a guy like that, let alone marry him, have kids with him and then stay with him after he left for two years to go be with the wolves? The wolves clearly ranked higher than his family in his book. I didn't like any of the characters either because they were all so selfish, felt sorry for themselves, and were too cowardly to do anything about their situations. No one wants to deal with anything in this book. They all run away from their problems leaving them all unresolved. I only liked this book for Jodi Picoult's excellent writing and the interesting information about people being brain dead vs. in a vegetative state.Each chapter is narrated by alternating characters. Luke's are all written in italics because he is in a coma. His were the most boring and ridiculous of the book. I did not care about any of the information about wolves and their packs. I especially didn't\u00a0Iike any of the wolf proverbs before many of the chapters. It was shoved down our throats enough that wolves are so wise and all knowing. I doubt any wolf acres more about humans than the other wolves. Luke cared more about them then his family because he fit in better with the animals. This guy just seemed crazy. The only reason he comes back to be with humans is because they don't love him back. They treat each other the way they do out of duty rather than love. Which is weird because that is how he parents his own kids. \u00a0Here he is giving all this information about how wolves parent their young and he tell us all the hierarchy in the wolf pack yet he himself sucks at being a parent. What little parenting he does is always related back to what wolves would do in their kids' situations. I guess the reader is supposed to be impressed by how intelligent the wolves are and all the lessons humans can learn about themselves by studying them. But all of that is lost because Luke never incorporates those into his own life. Oh wait, he does though when he has sex with his wife but is too rough like a wolf that he hurts her and bruises her skin all over. He fails at his own life. He abandons his kids and goes to live with wolves. Pretty good parenting there huh? Is that what a wolf would do? This guy was so full of bs that I didn't want to read any of his chapters. And he was the one in a coma that we were supposed to care about. I thought they should have given him to the wolves so they could take care of their own.I hate when authors play the reader for a fool by purposely holding back information in the form of secrets that the characters won't yet be ready to reveal the answers to until they have worked through enough to comes to term with them and then finally be able to tell the reader about them. Only at the end of course! This is the cheapest writing tactic and it is insulting. We are left wondering for the whole book what really happened in the car accident with Cara and her father and what did Luke say that was so awful to his son Edward that caused him to run off to live in Thailand forever at 18 leaving only a note behind. This is all done to string the leader along to make them stay til the end. It is unfortunate that Jodi Picoult feels she has to do this despite thinking her reader intelligent enough to read about medical jargon such as \"he had a temporal lobe hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage, an intraventricular hemorrhage that produced an incipient herniation.\"\u00a0Everyone was so bad at being in a family in this book. Obviously we have Luke who leaves his to go be with the wolves for two years. Cara\u00a0has her brother arrested and charged for murder because she wants her voice to finally be heard in this family. \u00a0Georgie remarries and purposely has new kids in order to try to do it \"right this time\". These people are so irresponsible that I never felt sorry for them or wanted them to get what they wanted. They deserved it. It is sad that I felt like that too because there were very important family issues and topics in this book that should have mattered but didn't because of the awful characters.I did like how ironic it was that a guy who preferred to be with the wolves because they had to deal with real issues such as life and death rather than deciding what cereal you want for breakfast is himself stuck between life and death in a coma.\u00a0A good take away from this book is that people need to discuss with their loved ones what they would want to happen to them if they were brain dead and if they would also want to be an organ donor."}, {"userName": "Stephanie (Stepping out of the Page)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2485722-stephanie-stepping-out-of-the-page", "userReview": "As soon as I heard about Jodi Picoult's latest novel, I just had to get my hands on a copy. When I did receive a copy from the publishers, I just couldn't wait to get started on it! Whilst I haven't read them all, I've read most of Jodi Picoult's novels and I've really enjoyed them, giving her a firm place in my favourite authors. I'll start by admitting that I was slightly wary of the 'wolf' aspect of this book. Whilst I love animals, I'm not usually keen on reading about them and I have had no interest in wolves before. Still, I really wanted to read it just because of the author. Thankfully, once again, she didn't let me down! Picoult does go into detail about wolves as they play a huge part in the novel, as you can expect simply from the title. I never felt overwhelmed by this information though - it became very fascinating and it's clear that a great amount of research went into the writing. I was extremely impressed with how Picoult formed the story - the recollections of Luke's time living with wolves worked extremely well in parallelling the events that were happening in the present. However, this book is not just about wolves - It is also about relationships, loyalty and family. It's also a novel about deciding what is right, not only for yourself, but for others. It's about letting go of perceptions, beliefs and people.There are several important characters, the main ones being Luke, Cara, Edward, Georgie and Joe, which we get to hear from as they independently narrate. Luke is the father of Cara and Edward, as well as the ex-husband of Georgie. He is our central character in this novel as the story revolves around him. After a car crash with his daughter, he is left in a coma and it must be decided what to do - turn off the machine that is keeping him alive so that his organs can be donated, or keep him alive and wait for a miracle? We learn more about Luke through accounts of his time living with wolves and through the thoughts and actions of his children and his ex-wife. Even after completing the book, I am still torn on my thoughts regarding Luke, but I think that it's a good thing that the author still has me thinking, even after I've finished reading.All of the characters that we are introduced to are deeply complex and have had so many experiences that have shaped and affected them. They each have distinctive voices opinions and it is interesting to see how they all interact. Picoult is fantastic at portraying the characters that she has created and allows us to really get to know them and feel their emotions. Picoult has a formula that she knows works - she crafts realistic stories, adds twists and turns, throws in well written arguments for both sides of often controversial topics and manages to come up with stories that have an impact upon you. If you liked her previous novels, there's no doubt that you'll enjoy this one just as much. If you haven't read any of her novels before, I promise you that you are missing out! I'd have no hesitation in recommending this book to anyone. This is yet another astonishing piece of writing from an incredibly talented author and now I'm impatiently waiting to see what she can offer us next!"}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4852457-suzanne", "userReview": "This was so captivating! You ask yourself so many questions about life, death, family, love, hate, and betrayal along with loyalty. I could not put this book down but had to for emotional stability lol. When I came back to it today, I read it nonstop until the end. I believe there are so many dynamics to family and relationships that we do not contemplate into faced with them head on because they make us uncomfortable and force us to ask questions about people we love and ourselves that we just would rather not. The aspects of animal and human behavior entwining and even separating in this book is phenomenal. Overall, a great story with a strong emotional feel.

So I was pretty sure when I picked this one up I would enjoy it. And enjoy I did...as usual there are fascinating characters that she draws you into, revealing more of them bit by bit till you feel you know and maybe even understand them. That is one of the defining elements in all her writing. But in this book I got something extra and I think you will too. I learned a lot about wolves, and how they live, and how that pertains to how we live, our very character as humans; what makes us different and remarkable, and what makes the animals so wonderful in their own right. And are we so far from the animals in behavior? Or is it just our interpretations of or reasons for the behaviors that are different? The book makes you think about these and other questions,including what is a family? How do we make our families and it helps us realize not just humans have this thing called family .

There is no instinctive driver I can relate to more. Whilst the leading character, Luke Warren himself is 'absent' (in a coma after an accident), we hear his voice throughout the novel, and come to understand that the man who seemed to be the underlying cause of all that was broken in this family, is perhaps the one who has been teaching them how to actually function as a family all along. Packed with the usual twists, and the heart-rending consequences of unspoken truths and buried secrets. I love that Picoult has used fiction to share so much about the behaviours of wild animals and more importantly, their motivations - which is would seem are rather different to ours. In my second year of a Bachelor of Applied Science in Animal Welfare, it was a special pleasure to be able to read a novel while I should be studying, and assauge my guilt because it was so topic related! I was deeply moved by the emotions that raged through these family members, and the analogy that ran through it all - of our need to learn to live like a wolf pack to thrive as a family. We would do well to learn much more from our fellow earthlings - who never act in spite, never take more than they need, share with every member of their pack, are not driven by ego, have respect and reverence for other packs, and who understand the intrinsic value of every player in their team. My greatest struggle in studying animal behaviour, is the underlying principle that humans have evolved to something 'grander'. I hope one day, when humans adopt similar values to those in the animal kingdom, we will see evidence that this is truly the case."}, {"userName": "C\u00e9lia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1152675-c-lia", "userReview": "Os dois livros que j\u00e1 li de Jodi Picoult mostraram-me a capacidade que a autora tem em abordar temas pol\u00e9micos, fazendo o leitor questionar-se sobre o que faria se se encontrasse na situa\u00e7\u00e3o das personagens, enquanto transmite, de forma bastante conseguida, a exist\u00eancia de um limite t\u00e9nue entre o que est\u00e1 certo e o que est\u00e1 errado.

This book was a painful but somehow therapeutic read. It hit me so close to home but what I liked the most about it is how genuine everything felt from the visits to the ICU, the meetings with the doctors, and the pain of the uncertainty of a parent's recovery. The daughter Cara is 17 years-old and I was 18 years-old when I had to go through something very similar with the parent I was closest to. The grief she felt was so real it brought me back to the times I was in the ICU myself. At the same time I understood the anger Edward had toward his family and having to be the older sibling (which I am also) as well as the one burdened by dark family secrets. This book is special in that I literally understood how these characters felt so much that I was empathizing rather than sympathizing. I think Mrs. Picoult did an amazing job in capturing the emotions of having to watch someone you love hang in the balance of life and death with no way of communicating back to the ones who they love and who loves them most. I felt the outcome was realistic and there are a lot of thoughts the characters had that I shared as well. It's a tearjerker especially for those who have experienced it firsthand but I'm glad I got to read it because it's a story I won't forget."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7278451-maria", "userReview": "Mais uma vez a escritora n\u00e3o desilude com mais um livro onde um dilema nos faz ver os 2 lados da quest\u00e3o.

Of the 5 or so characters we met, I felt only emotionally invested in two of them (Luke and Joe) and only minimally at best. In past novels by Jodi she has done such a good job at making you feel something for the characters that you are emotionally invested in their futures and the outcomes of their situations. This was not at all true with Lone Wolf. I felt very little for Edward, nothing for Cara, and Georgie was just kind of \"there\".I enjoyed reading about the wolves. It was by far the best part of the book. It made me identify with Luke and I learned some new things I didn't know. I had empathy for Joe who was put in the middle of a terrible situation.***SPOILER ALERT*****So the big \"gotcha\" moment is that you find out that Luke cheated on Georgie and terminated a pregnancy of one of his girlfriends. Here's the thing though - I don't buy it. It is against everything we leared about Luke. It felt very out of place for his character, so Jodi either did a terrible job showing us who Luke really was, or she just stuck it in there for the shock value. And what an AWFUL excuse for Edward to take off to Thailand.I hate downing Jodi because she did have me once. I was hooked at one point, and would have considered her my favorite author. I just don't feel that anymore. I keep waiting to be captivated like I was with My Sister's Keeper, the Pact, Plain Truth, or Salem Falls. It just hasn't happened in a very long time now. I don't know if the books are coming out too fast or what it is, but it is definitely affecting the quality of the work.

Luke Warren is severely injured in a car accident and lies comatose in hospital. His estranged son returns from Thailand after a seven year absence to be at his father's bedside, to the disgust of his younger sister. Cara Warren is seventeen, too young to make medical decisions for her father and resents Edwards authority. When Edward makes the painful choice to discontinue life support, Cara accuses him of wanting to kill their father and seeks a legal order to stop him. The emotional battle will reveal the secrets of the broken family as the siblings each seek to honour their father in their own ways.The story of Lone Wolf unfolds through alternating chapters from the perspectives of the main characters, Luke, his children Edward and Cara, ex wife Georgie and briefly, Helen, the court appointed Public Guardian. Cara, who was also in the accident, is devastated by her fathers injuries and unable to rationally consider his medical status. Having lived with her father for the past five years she feels she should have the right to choose the path of her father's care and with the naivete of youth is determined that life support be continued indefinitely, convinced a miracle will occur. Cara deeply resents Edward, blaming him for the break up of their parents marriage and is irrationally convinced that Edward hates Luke and wants him dead.Edward left home at eighteen after a fight with his father, allowing his mother and sister to believe it had to do with revealing his sexuality. Luke's motives were actually more complicated and he has kept them hidden by keeping his distance from the family. Returning home forces him to face the consequences of his estrangement.Georgie is torn between the needs of her children, her ex husband and her new family. She wants to support both Cara and Edward but the decision they face doesn't allow her to.While a large part of the novel concerns the issues of the withdrawal of life support, organ donation and medical guardianship it is also about who Luke and his wolves, though Luke remains unconscious during the entire book. Luke is a wildlife biologist with an obsession for wolves. His unusual study methods including living with a wild wolves in Canada and feeding from raw carcasses with his captive pack. The information Picoult shares about the wolves is interesting and she neatly relates it to her characters but Luke's behaviour can't help but strike you as a little bizarre. I also cynically wonder if Picoults choice of wolves to feature in this novel comes from the commercial appeal of their paranormal counterparts, particularly as Lone Wolf has a YA slant.For me, there was nothing terribly bad about Lone Wolf but neither was there anything remarkable. I felt at times that Picoult favoured melodrama over real passion, the issues seemed to be little more than a surface debate and the plot was too contrived. Unfortunately the characters also largely left me cold. I was sympathetic, but Cara acted half her age and Georgie just sort of flapped around ineffectually. Of the three I liked Edward the most but there were a few incidents he was involved in that didn't work for me as plot points.I think fans of Picoult will be left distinctly underwhelmed by Lone Wolf but its an accessible title for a younger audience and a reasonably quick read as the typeset is quite large. The marketing drive is certainly quite extensive so I would expect that despite my opinion Lone Wolf will quickly appear on the bestseller lists."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "Luke Warren finds it easier to live with wolves than with his own human family. His son, Edward, has resided in Thailand for the past five years after having a fight with his father, and his wife, Georgie, has divorced him. Now he only resides with his seventeen-year-old daughter, Cara. But after a devastating car accident leaves Luke comatose and Cara injured, Edward is forced to come back to the states and choose with Cara whether or not his father should be taken off life support. Edward and Cara's conflicting attitudes toward their father makes the decision difficult, and the things that they will do to get what they want could tear their family apart forever.Staying true to her style, Picoult creates another well-written novel centered around a controversial issue that involves a tension-filled court case. I had never put much thought into life support and vegetative states before reading this book - at least not as much as I do other issues - but Picoult does a good job balancing the medical jargon with simpler terms that the average reader will understand. Her trademark skill of showing multiple sides and incorporating plenty of pathos shines in Lone Wolf once again, and I could not put this book down by the midway point.However, this book was not as fantastic as some of her others. I did not connect to the characters as much as I wanted to, though I did care for them at a surface level. Similarly I was not enamored with the wolves, but I enjoyed how she interconnected their side of the story to that of the main characters. I caught a few minor errors - for example, on one page she writes that a character is crying for the first time in a long time, but on the page before that the character had just cried.Though not her best book, Lone Wolf will immerse readers and most likely please fans of Picoult's other works, as well as those interested in wolves.

A painful experience to one, brings forward similar pain in the other, and that is what happens in this book.Luke Warren transcends from human existence into 'wolfdom', leaving his real family behind. When he is involved in a serious accident with his daughter, Cara, and ends up in a vegetative state, the divided family's pot of secrets and hurts gets cooking. The two siblings have to make a decision but cannot agree on what would make their father happy and which decision will reflect his own. While their stories are told, Luke's own story weaves through it all as a replay of his life between the wolves in Canada. There are so many great reviews of this book, that I do not want to indulge much.A little bit slow-moving, fascinating, yet a bit far fetched. The hero is the biggest anti-hero of them all, which in my opinion, lends a believable trail throughout the narrative.Since the book aims to raise awareness for wolf research, it is understandable that the plot and theme would want to stir emotions and leave the reader to reconsider their attitudes towards wolves. It worked.It was a good read indeed! It took me more than two weeks of sporadic reading to get it finished.

This book dragged me into a story, that I was uncertain about and before I knew it I was firmly engrossed. So much so that I continued to read through the tears, laughter, pain and heartache until the end of the book. Luke Warren, the main character, was a man who lived life within his own boundaries. To some that life excluded his human family. To others he was a man who was able to understand and be one with a pack of wolves. This is not so much a story about life after severe and traumatic brain injury. This is not so much a story about anyone's rights to life and death. It is a story of a family torn apart by a man with all his glories and failings. It is a story about hope, anger, love and grief. Those who know me, know I am a Jodi Picoult fan. While not all her books catch me the same way, they all make me take a part of myself and turn and twist it around - reshape it. For me, they make you face difficult subjects from all sides when there is no right or wrong. This book was more emotionally visceral.Jodi's books sometimes signal the surprise ending and sometimes the endings slam into you taking your breath away. Prepare to reassess decisions made. Were they made with cold calculation of the pack or part of a family with all their foibles?

Luke's two children, Edward and Cara, hold opposing views for what they each believe their father would want. While their mother and lawyer stepfather try to support each party equally, ultimately this difficult situation causes friction and family tensions surface.As with most Picoult novels I've read, I thoroughly enjoyed this. It shines light on a difficult topic - when does life begin and when does death start?

No entanto, a sua dedica\u00e7\u00e3o a estes animais - que o levou a ser visto por uns como um g\u00e9nio e por outros como um louco - conduziu a uma neglig\u00eancia para com a pr\u00f3pria fam\u00edlia. O lar \u00e9 apenas um local de passagem para Luke para tomar um duche, mudar de roupa ou fazer uma refei\u00e7\u00e3o ocasional, n\u00e3o sendo portanto de estranhar que a fam\u00edlia acabe por se desintegrar.Com Luke aprendemos que, para os lobos, a \"fam\u00edlia\" \u00e9 tudo - cada membro da matilha deve desempenhar o seu papel de forma a garantir a seguran\u00e7a colectiva, obedecendo a um sistema hier\u00e1rquico muito bem definido que lhes permite, ainda assim, manter a individualidade. E a fam\u00edlia - as diferen\u00e7as entre os seus constituintes, cada um contribuindo para fortalecer o grupo, a import\u00e2ncia do desempenho de cada um no resultado final - \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m a base deste livro. Ironicamente, apesar de conhecer muito bem o seu lugar na fam\u00edlia de lobos, Luke parece ter dificuldades em apreender as suas obriga\u00e7\u00f5es na fam\u00edlia de humanos, como pai e marido.Edward, o filho mais velho, sente que sempre desiludiu o pai, com quem n\u00e3o consegue encontrar interesses nem caracter\u00edsticas em comum; os seus relatos sobre as tentativas de se aproximar do pai durante a inf\u00e2ncia permitem-nos compreender a revolta que viria a desenvolver na adolesc\u00eancia. Assim, aos 18 anos Edward decide fugir para a Tail\u00e2ndia sem se despedir sequer dos pais ou da irm\u00e3. Convencida que foi este acontecimento que despoletou o a ru\u00edna do casamento dos pais, Cara acaba por desenvolver um forte ressentimento pelo irm\u00e3o e, quando a m\u00e3e reconstr\u00f3i a vida com outro homem, de quem tem dois filhos g\u00e9meos, Cara sente que n\u00e3o h\u00e1 lugar para ela naquela fam\u00edlia e decide ir viver com o pai.Toda esta informa\u00e7\u00e3o - e muita mais - vamos reunindo ao longo do livro atrav\u00e9s de v\u00e1rios pontos de vista que a autora soube inserir na altura certa, permitindo-nos desenvolver fortes empatias e entrar na narrativa com um interesse crescente. O livro come\u00e7a, no entanto, com o acidente de carro em que seguia Cara e Luke. Quando a jovem de 17 anos acorda da cirurgia a que foi submetida de urg\u00eancia descobre que o pai sofreu um trauma cerebral muito s\u00e9rio que levou \u00e0 remo\u00e7\u00e3o da parte anterior do lobo temporal e que se encontra num estado de inconsci\u00eancia do qual provavelmente nunca mais ir\u00e1 acordar.\u00c9 este triste desencadeamento que volta a reunir a fam\u00edlia; uma vez que Cara \u00e9 menor de idade, Edward \u00e9 obrigado a regressar da Tail\u00e2ndia para agir de forma decisiva sobre o futuro de uma fam\u00edlia da qual n\u00e3o faz parte h\u00e1 seis anos. Derrotista ou realista, com a inten\u00e7\u00e3o de poupar a irm\u00e3 a uma terr\u00edvel decis\u00e3o e apenas a tentar fazer o que acha que o pai preferiria numa situa\u00e7\u00e3o destas, Edward confia na opini\u00e3o m\u00e9dica de que a probabilidade de o pai recuperar \u00e9 praticamente nula, querendo terminar o suporte artificial de vida o mais depressa poss\u00edvel para que os \u00f3rg\u00e3os possam ser utilmente doados e para que a fam\u00edlia possa finalmente seguir em frente. Por seu lado, naturalmente optimista, com tend\u00eancia para a fantasia, Cara opta por se agarrar \u00e0 esperan\u00e7a de o pai ter cerca de 1% de probabilidade de recuperar do acidente ... e est\u00e1 disposta a tudo para manter o pai vivo.\nAdorei este livro!\n Gostei especialmente dos cap\u00edtulos de Luke sobre o comportamento dos lobos. A hist\u00f3ria de Lobo Solit\u00e1rio n\u00e3o \u00e9 leve e n\u00e3o deixa de ecoar tragicamente, mesmo depois de termos terminado o livro h\u00e1 algum tempo; afinal, estamos perante um pai que n\u00e3o o soube ser e que perdeu subitamente a oportunidade de se redimir perante os filhos. Fica-nos tamb\u00e9m a d\u00favida de que, sendo-lhe ofertada uma segunda oportunidade, se ela a agarraria ou se seria sequer capaz de reconhecer. Mas mais do que isso, esta \u00e9 a hist\u00f3ria de uma fam\u00edlia que deve fazer o necess\u00e1rio para se auto-preservar, para garantir a seguran\u00e7a e estabilidade dos seus membros."}, {"userName": "Lisa Vegan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan", "userReview": "[ I\u2019m all for organ donation but I don\u2019t think this entry did any good for it, though I think it was meant to be pro-organ donation.

However, wolves don't do it for me. I don't care about the different roles in a wolf pack. So about half-way through I started skipping all Luke's wolf-talk chapters and only read the closing paragraph as that summed up the point Jodi wanted to get across in that chapter. Doing that definitely made the book flow more and kept me interested. If I didn't do that, I am not sure I would have finished it as the wolf bits slowed it down and were boring.Luke, although in a coma throughout the book, was a despicable, self-centred ass in all the flashbacks and I kept hoping he would just die and stop the trauma it was causing his family. He wasn't a nice enough character to will to survive.Cara was a narcisstic, self-centred, sneaky, lying, divaish brat and I had no feelings of sympathy for her at all.Edward was so forgiving; I can't believe he forgave Cara for the sneaky stunt she pulled which made him end up in jail. But he was definitely the best of the bunch.Georgie, hmm was a bit of an iffy character and needed to get some spunk and stand up for herself more.Joe, he was the stand-out character in this book, the only one I really liked and connected with. The husband of Georgie, step-father of Edward and Cara, he did the right thing at all times and possessed far more wisdom than Luke ever had. Mind you, Luke got all his wisdom from the wolves and we all know how even Red Riding Hood and the three little pigs got the better of the wolf.What made me keep reading this book, was because I really wanted to find out why Edward ran away to Thailand and what the true story was that caused Luke and Cara's car accident.
