It was a overall good story and people who love zombie stories will no doubt love this short story. Reading this makes you think about a lot of things in the world today that you just never know what the ramifications might be in \"altering\" genetic codes of things."}, {"userName": "Sher", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22263976-sher", "userReview": "very good and a lot of fun.. small town story..with a possible could happen twist..hopefully this will be book 1 of more to come. will make me think twice before having that bag of potato chips.."}, {"userName": "Teresa Bowen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23105059-teresa-bowen", "userReview": "I am a big fan of Maggie Shayne and have been for years but when I first saw the title I wasn't sure how zombies and a love story would go together. It is a wonderfully written short story and the ending leaves the opening for more books to follow if she so desires. And a handsome buff genius geek as the hero doesn't hurt at all. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it and will definitely be looking at my chips more closely after reading this story. Way to go Maggie. I loved it."}, {"userName": "Sandi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13164705-sandi", "userReview": "Zombies, A Love Story by Maggie ShayneI loved this story but I wish it had been longer.

They are all grown up now and both happen to be home when their friends and neighbors turn into zombies after eating genetically enhanced potato chips. They end up killing all the zombies in town, and torch the potato field where the enhanced potatoes are being grown. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen in time to stop the potatoes from pollinating. So, the zombie problem wasn't contained after all. That's where the story ends. You don't know how the world survives this Zombie Apocalypse. I hope that Ms. Shayne is going to write a sequel to this one. While good, it leaves you hanging. And it reads like a regular fiction short story, there is no romance (just an FYI)."}, {"userName": "Kylie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3301201-kylie", "userReview": "[The whole reason he had taken the job with the company he did was also ridiculous - oh right, I will take a job with the place my girlfriend hates most in the world, just so I can be with her, because hey, she won't consider that selling out.

So when I saw that my favorite author wrote a zombie story I was excited. I am a series reader so once in awhile I like to throw in a stand alone while I am waiting for the next in a series or to break up all the series I read. This was the perfect short story to do that for me. I thought the pace of it was great and I loved the detail Maggie put into it. The concept of how the zombies came about was different but made sense to me. The only reason I gave it 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 was that it was to short for me and I would have loved for it to keep going :)"}, {"userName": "Valerie Dixon", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17751612-valerie-dixon", "userReview": "Are you a fan of old zombie movies? The Walking Dead?If you are this novella is a must read! Join the population of Bloody Gulch as they try to survive an outbreak that turns into a full- blown zombie apocalypse.

And her nerdy high school sweetheart has come home a card carrying hunk, making her plan to let him down easy a little harder to carry out.
