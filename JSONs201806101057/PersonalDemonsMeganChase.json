Oh look, the previous owner was kind enough to leave some of their HAIR in it. \n Ugh. When I am independently wealthy I am buying all of my books brand new. People are so gross.Megan is a counselor who recently agreed to host a radio show that promises to \u201cslay personal demons\u201d. Unfortunately, Megan lives in a world where real demons exist and now they think she\u2019s after them. Yikes!This seriously complicates her life and brings all sorts of new people and demons into it. Problem is, even though she\u2019s psychic, she can\u2019t read demons and discern the helpful ones from the harmful ones. Greyson Dante claims to be the helpful sort but he\u2019s a demon, and how far can one really trust a demon? Especially a gorgeous demon . . . This book is pretty light and fluffy and fun. There\u2019s nothing too dramatic, gory or heart-wrenching going on. It\u2019s a little sexy, a little snarky and a good choice if you\u2019re looking for a book that won\u2019t rip out your heart. I\u2019ve heard this author is known for edgy characters but this one reminded me more of a fun tv episode and sort of has the light-hearted IZombie (minus the zombie) vibe going for it.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to find my dinner date.\u201d I bumped this one up a bit because I was intrigued by Megan's job as a radio host, after reading about Kitty in Kitty and the Midnight Hour and how fun her radio programme ended up being. This one sounded cute and fluffy but different enough to work. \t\t\t\t\t\tUnlike Kitty, Megan's radio programming takes a small role in the book. Besides the beginning with the one session, it's not really mentioned again. Instead Megan discovers right away, a little unrealistically so, that she has done some harm to her reputation from her one radio broadcast about demons on the shoulder. It's confusing half the time whether she is being recruited or protected. The romantic interest is a little unrealistic too, because there is an almost instant bond I don't fully get - still, there's some steam and I felt the chemistry sizzle through the pages anyway.\t\t\t\t\t\tAs expected there's some humor and quirkiness, particularly in the three bodyguards who were probably the best thing about the book. The journalist was an interesting character with a few tricks up his sleeve and ended up being a strong support for the story, not just an enemy or danger like the back synopsis reads. Megan herself is okay as a lead, not bad but not someone I fell in love with either. There's some humor here and there, but not as fluffy as I feared on all angles. The plotline is an interesting one but its a little loosely contracted. There's holes you could dig apart if you wished to.\t\t\t\t\t\tOverall a fun way to spend a few hours, but nothing to get overly excited about.

The sleaze of her boss is trying to make the show worthy of a tabloid. She even has to give an interview for one. During her show something happens that throws Megan into a world full of real demons. They are all after her and the only person who could help her is hiding things too. It's not surprising nor new for the genre that she is kind of special and has the past. Megan as a character drove me crazy how polite she is. I mean, if one has to be polite to stupid and mean people because of the job or something, one doesn't want to see fictional characters doing it too. Still, considering the reason she is like that (she has a good one), I understood and accepted. The plot is good enough for an opening story in Megan Chase series. Most of the important issues are resolved by the end. The basis for the rest is there, but if you don't want to continue with the next one, you won't lose much. I think I may wait a bit to read the rest since both blurbs 'promise' some kind of drama (oh, joy) - the bane of series featuring one character. I am still on a break from some of those because of the stupid or unnecessary drama.Overall, Personal Demons is a good opening story.

Demon Slayer is the newest radio star in a call-in show. Her slogan is: \"How may I slay your demons today?\" (A motto she finds ridiculous. Sadly, her boss loves it.) Unfortunately for Meigan, her clients are not the only ones that seem to believe the statement; so do the personal demons. Due to a traumatic occurrence when she was 16, Megan is the only human without a small, personal demon on her shoulder, whispering in her ear. This fact, coupled with her being psychic, makes her the target of an army of tiny personal demons and and ancient, highly dangerous soul-sucking demon known as The Accuser.Enter the demonic version of Prince Charming: The scorching hot (in more ways than one; he's also a fire demon) Greyson Dante in his black Jaguar. He represents a demon family that want to use Megan as a way to gain more power. He and his three body guards; Malleus, Maleficarum, and Spud, successfully guards her from a wide range of dangerous, supernatural creatures such as zombies, vampires as well as the personal demons themselves, who are all out to off her. To top it all off, a tabloid reporter, Brian Stone, is writing an article about \"Dr. Demon Slayer.\" He's been digging into Megan's past and not all finding are good for her budding radio career...Aside from the great action, one of the things I liked most about this book is that the author was able to create a hero and heroine that I truly loved. Not to mention the secondary characters like the three demon body guards/brothers with excellent hairdressing skills, and her Yezer Ha-Ra minions/personal demons. So what if they feed on human misery, I absolutely adored them;-)The only down side was the cockney english. Far too often, that dialect is used to describe persons (or demons) with lesser intelligence (& hearts of gold.)

I bought the book because I was interested in the world, but I found the world-building utterly lacking. For once, I wish there was more info-dumping. The author rushes through scenes that move the plot forward, leaving the characters half-baked. I never once believed Megan was a psychologist. Greyson never gets much development and whatever development he gets is strange for a demon born lawyer who's used to demon politics. I never bought the Megan-Greyson attraction. The best part about this novel, though, is the climax, where Megan confronts the novel's villian. This scene basically saves the book, because afterwards, we're backed to half-baked charcters. Megan accepts her new situation pretty well (i.e. no reaction at all). All in all, Kane had a good idea for a fantasy, but rushed the plot and the character development. The sex scenes were well written, but since the chaarcters involved had no chemistry, I didn't care."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8299679-christine", "userReview": "As all 1st books in a series I immediately loved this!Once I finished this series I immediately purchased the novels to have hard copies at hand.

They suited the story so well and made you fall in love with them as much as the H/h. This book can be seen as a 'dark' read.

Trying a new author is always a crap shoot, regardless of the quantity of positive reviews, regardless of summaries, blurbs, and testimonials. Sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you don't. Luck be Stacia Kane's Personal Demons tonight! I've read some really good books this year, books I was pleased with, books I even loved, but I have to admit, this is the first book in a while that I got really excited about while reading it. The story is unique, the mythology - while not completely fleshed out yet - intriguing and original, and the characters definitely interesting (and sexy).Megan Chase, PhD., is a therapist with a bit extra who's just recently started a weekly radio show with a rather auspicious tag line about helping to slay a caller's personal demons. Innocuous enough for us, but if you're a demon...Soon Megan is seeing all manner of crazy things and the tall, dark, and handsome (if a bit smokey) Greyson Dane is showing up on her doorstep warning her not to make any deals with the devil, so to speak. She's confused and perplexed...right up until full-on terror comes knocking. As it turns out, it seems the demons of the world have taken her tag line rather personally and someone has decided to do unto her before she does unto them. Grey, a fire demon himself and not exactly prone to fear a singular human psychologist, steps in to lend a hand - and three demonic bodyguards - to keep that from happening.As the plot unfolds and a murky past comes back to taunt her, Megan is drawn further and further into a world she had no idea existed and yet somehow isn't totally surprised about...but maybe that's because some part of her, perhaps the psychic part, always sensed something else out there. Now that something is trying to kill her and all she has to trust are demons who aren't exactly interested in selflessness.Admittedly, Personal Demons is by no means a technically flawless book. The beginning is a bit plodding (until one night-of-the-living-dead moment) and I never totally bought Megan as a therapist with a PhD. She seemed through the book to be a bit more layman than therapist, and there were a couple of moments where I saw some less then astute behavior in dealing with things. I also question a couple of the plot devices that introduced the reporter Brian Stone and kept him in the sometimes foil, sometimes friend position. I also can't say that I totally buy into the connection between events in Megan's past and her present. I thought it seemed just a bit too ...something...convenient maybe - though definitely not for Megan. There were also some weird time jumps, where scenes got skipped over, and some of those scenes I think I would've preferred seeing written out - like the dinner with the meat pies, for one. I think if those had been written out it would've given the book an added dimension and let the reader get more familiar and comfortable with the characters.All that being said, there was a bunch of positive stuff, too. I loved the Misters Brown! Malleus, Maleficarum, and Spud - three cockney demons with hearts of gold! I thoroughly enjoyed the slow development of the relationship between Grey and Megan and was pleased where they stood at the end of the book, given the week or so they've known each other. Much more realistic than some love-at-first-sight thing while acknowledging that lust at first sight with some affection is far more believable. I thought the opportunity for future development and continuing mythology including Tera and the witches, as well as the psychic reporter Brian was fantastic. On the plot side of things, I was very pleasantly surprised by the successful maintenance of tension and increasing danger, and there's a scene towards the end (without giving spoilers) that was written well enough that even I was feeling a little ill and very threatened. The story progression was increasingly intricate and the blending of a couple of separate plot points flowed together organically.I certainly am aware the sum of the critical aspects could very easily bring down my rating of this book, but in this case, it didn't. I admit, I submitted five stars based on emotion, not on technical superiority. I loved the book, even with it's flaws, and I'm very interested in continuing this delightful urban fantasy series. ~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."}, {"userName": "Carolyn  Storer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2449271-carolyn-storer", "userReview": "This is the first book in the Megan Chase series by Stacia Kane. I read it last year but as I received Demon Inside to review I thought I would refresh my memory and re-read Personal Demons.Megan is a psychological counsellor who hosts her own radio show. Her slogan is \"how can I slay your personal demons?\". Megan also happens to be slightly psychic and uses her ability to see into people's minds so she can help them with their problems, whether they are listeners who phone her radio show or clients who see her in person at her practice. One night, coming home from work, she meets a guy called Greyson, who's waiting on her doorstep. He changes her life forever. She's not really sure if she can trust him and after so many revelations (the existence of demon's, witches and zombies), she wishes she could go back to her normal life. The main concern though are the Personal Demons, that sit on the shoulders of humans making them do bad things. They have taken her radio show slogan personally and are out to get her. These small green demons remind me of the naughty Gremlins in the Gremlin movies. There are other demons that Megan has to face throughout the book, which she does with growing confidence.The relationships between Megan and some of the other characters do happen a bit too quickly. The sexual banter between Megan and Greyson begins just after their first meeting and feels a bit rushed. But after a few chapters it becomes more natural and I end up really enjoying it. I really like Greyson Dante's character. He is a seriously sexy demon and one with a soft center, but who doesn't really like showing it, which makes him even more delicious. The intimate scenes are well written and I really appreciated the restraint in explicit language, which, while I'm not a prude, is not really my thing. I also had difficulty with the three guardian demons Greyson sends to protect Megan - they all have a strong cockney accent. Now, I think accents are one of the most difficult skills to pull off in writing and I'm not sure it really works here. But although it was quite irritating to begin with, especially as I'm from the UK, the demons did eventually win me over, they are quite endearing.Megan, as an urban fantasy protagonist, doesn't start out all guns blazing. She really does need as much protection as she can get as she doesn't have a clue how to protect herself against all the demons and zombies that are thrown at her. And she screams - a lot. But by the end of the book she has learnt a thing or two and can stand up for herself and for others.Verdict:This is an easy book to get into and the story flows very well. There is always something going on that keeps you turning the pages. I think it is a really good start to a new series and I am interested in finding out more about Megan, and of course Greyson, so I look forward to reading book two!I actually gave this book 7/10 on my blog, but Goodreads doesn't have half stars."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4731410-lauren", "userReview": "Personal Demons3 StarsSuperficial world building and characterization but the plot has potential and the climax and resolution are riveting. Megan is an appealing heroine with an independent streak and a snarky sense of humor. Unfortunately, her smart mouth fails her when she needs it the most and ultimately comes across as weak willed and lacking backbone as she allows almost every other character to bully her - her boss, her lover, her colleagues, the tabloid reporter and the villain. Her backstory is insufficiently developed which detracts both from her character and the plot. The hero, Greyson Dante, is your typical alpha male who just happens to be a demon. Of course, he has a heart of gold despite forwarding his own agenda. He and Megan have some great chemistry although it is never really clear what he sees in her.The rest of the supporting cast are a mixed bag. The villain is obvious from the start (although there is a slight twist at the end that contributes to the suspenseful climax) and the demon bodyguards are simply wonderful. The character that stands out the most in his obnoxiousness is Brian, the smarmy tabloid reporter. He treats Megan with an inappropriate sense of familiarity bordering on stalkerish, turns into a prejudiced, hypocritical git and finally does a 180 and becomes a savior in disguise leaving the reader scratching their head in confusion. All in all, this is an OK read but if you are interested in a truly excellent world with intriguing demon characters then I recommend Larissa Ione's Demonica series."}, {"userName": "Jenne ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5705914-jenne", "userReview": "4.5I was a little worried to read this.

So much so that she was drafted to take up a side gig as a radio therapist.

When she drops her shields, she can slide into her patient\u2019s mind and see the thing he is (or isn\u2019t) describing. She tries to only use this skill to help those paying her to do so, but when she arrives home after a flustering first night on the radio to find a tall, chiseled man on her doorstep, she goes for the read. Only Megan can\u2019t read him, and the look on his face says he knows it.The mystery man is Greyson Dante, and Megan is convinced he\u2019s some sort of lawyer. (Though, he never admits to it.) Eventually, he informs her that demons are real and, more importantly, alerts her that the subset of personal demons \u2014 those which encourage humans to do destructive acts \u2014 are out to get her. They took her show\u2019s tagline seriously and now the word is out: End Dr. Megan Chase before she ends us.Megan is thrown into a world she didn\u2019t believe in, and set between two men she\u2019s not sure she can trust. On the one side is the devastatingly handsome Greyson. He consistently protects Megan, including drumming up bodyguards for her, but she can tell he\u2019s keeping things from her. The more she can see demons surrounding her, the more she knows she\u2019s out of her league. On the other side is Brian, a reporter who is doing a \u201cweek in the life\u201d story on the city\u2019s new demon slayer. He\u2019s a reporter. Megan hates that. She doesn\u2019t want her life on the page, and Brian is just a bit too insightful. He culls old articles and finds Megan was suspected of murder as a teen. His new allegations make her wonder if he\u2019s working for more than the newspaper.On top of it all, the jerk colleague Megan so detests is convinced she\u2019s agreed to work at his clinic with him. The longer she\u2019s around him, the more terrifying he becomes. The flashes of death, her past and what lurks beneath her colleague\u2019s eyes shake Megan.She\u2019d much rather handle things herself, but as things turn for the worse, she can\u2019t help but accept help from those she didn\u2019t know existed a mere week ago.To sum it up (and keep it all spoiler-free): While it takes a bit to get attached to all the characters in Personal Demons, Stacia Kane does an excellent job crafting a series starter. By two-thirds of the way in, I already knew I\u2019d be picking up the second novel in the Megan Chase series, Demon Inside.

There was action, suspense (Megan\u00b4s fight with the zombies was really scary and exciting and had me on the edge of my seat), romance, hot passion and really a plot that could hold my interest till the end of the book.

It spends a bit too much time on sex for my liking, and I have to admit to not particularly caring for the main male character, which made it hard for me to care much about his chemistry with the heroine. Plus, at least towards the beginning, there are a couple of weird bits in the flow of the plot--bits where things suddenly jump ahead a little and then refer to something else that just happened off-camera, making you wonder if you missed a scene.That said, there's also some good strong stuff here. Three lesser characters, a trio of guard demons, pretty much steal the show for me. This particular heroine's take on a supernatural ability is unusual--not the part where she's psychic, but more the part where this got her into massive trouble as a teenager and that trouble's coming back to bite her in the ass.

The quick, fast paced story had me intrigued from the beginning with its array of interesting cast members who made me laugh (the cockney brothers with their \"beauty skills :D ), who made me want to punch things (well, a few in this story made me want to do that!!) & then there's Dante..who made me weak at the knees & want to punch him in the face at the same time!Good to see that this book didn't have a lasting effect...no, no anger there..:DNice touch too, having the Meat Pie recipe she cooks at the end of the book! Great story, told well...really looking forward to jumping in on the next books as Stacia leaves you with enough juicy bits to make you want to go back for more."}, {"userName": "Danielle Gypsy Soul", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35114142-danielle-gypsy-soul", "userReview": "This book had potential and I expected it to be gritty based on Downside Ghosts. Unfortunately I found Megan to be a pretty weak character. She basically let everyone walk all over her. Then when she got mad at Dante for not helping her \"save an innocent\" and said can't you do anything for me after he had bent over backwards to help her I just thought she was selfish. Dante was a decent character but I wanted more chemistry between the two of them. I'm not sure what Dante saw in Megan. I also thought Dante had too much of a \"heart of gold\" for a demon. Yes he was furthering his agenda and didn't speak about his feelings but he just didn't come across as a badass demon to me. It was just okay and there are so many better PNR/UF books out there that I will give the rest of this series a pass."}, {"userName": "Cathy ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526945-cathy", "userReview": "3.5 stars. Very cute, sort of an urban fantasy-romance. A bit more gritty and story focused than most paranormal romances, but with a strong (and sexy) romantic element. A bit frenetic at times, with too many elements casually tossed around, but overall a fun read. Just don't go in expecting it to be anything like Kane's other series, this is an entirely different kind of story. The only similarities are really in the main characters, both trying hard to do the right thing despite their doubts about their own pasts and self-worth. It's interesting to see an author writing two series with such different tones and directions, and to search for the similarities underneath the surface."}, {"userName": "Ctanner", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3367809-ctanner", "userReview": "I finished this last night and I needed the night to process what I felt about the book. The first half of the book I was on the shelf of liking this first installment of the trilogy. Megan, the heroine grows on you. I think the book really hit its stride in the last half. I liked the twists and the action was just enough.

She\u2019s not the only one, there actually are personal demons and they aren\u2019t impressed with her. Personal demons are the ones that sit on your shoulder and whisper to humans \u201cdo bad things\u201d as they live off the energy given by certain emotions and they believe Megan is trying to slay them. Add into the mix one Greyson Dante, a reporter Brian & three demon bodyguards backing her up. Then you have zombies and some pretty nasty demons trying to kill Megan. What\u2019s a girl to do?I have to say, everytime I picked up this book I heard Depeche Mode in my head but the words changed from Personal Jesus to Personal Demons. Thanks Stacia!Personal Demons is extremely individual concept, it was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever read about demons. Demons see evil differently than we humans do, gathering energy through depression, sadness and anger to live. The pacing was great and let me tell you, Stacia writes one helluva sex scene, I\u2019m still sweating. I also would like to inquire where I can find my very own Greyson Dante, who knew a fire demon could be so hot?Megan is a great character, she can fight with the best of them when she needs too but freaks the hell out when zombies attack her in her bathroom! Speaking of attacks, the action scenes are amazing and well detailed it\u2019s like you\u2019re right in the room with Megan. The three demon bodyguards were my favorite in the series, not only can they fight like hell but they can do make up and give awesome clothing advice! There\u2019s also snark and I am all about the snark and witty comebacks!There are all sorts of twists and turns, towards the end I was pretty shocked! For the last 4 chapters I couldn\u2019t put the book down, I actually turned off the TV and put my cellphone on silent. The big ending was awesome and I had to run out and buy book two right away!I definitely recommend Personal Demons if you like action mixed with some pretty amazing sex scenes, all wrapped in a great plot."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3256911-sara", "userReview": "Plot: 2.5 StarsAs much as I wanted to love the premise of the story, many of the things I was looking forward to seemed almost absent. I was expecting to learn and interact more with the personal demons (an idea I was really excited for) since they were the namesake of the book, but they really didn't play that big of a part. I was also excited to read about the radio show and Megan's practice, but those were a little absent also. But I'll definitely be checking out the next book in hopes that the Personal Demons play a bigger part.Pace: 3 StarsOnly about a week goes by throughout the timeline of the book, but it definitely feels like more. Multiples times, I wondered to myself why Megan hadn't done another radio show. There was also a point near the end, right before the action really picked up, that seemed like filler. It was slow and I got a little bored, which led me to take a little break from the story. Characters: 3 StarsI liked Megan as an Urban Fantasy heroine. I like it when the UF heroine isn't completely badass, it's a nice change compared to the numerous heroines who are always running around guns blazing. Greyson and Brian were harder for me to connect with. I couldn't decide whether to like or dislike them. But I loved the three guards sent to follow Megan around. The author did a good job with the dialogue, they're accents came through very well. Plus, they brought a nice bit of humor to the book.Cover: 3 StarsAlthough the cover is a nice change from the current trend in Urban Fantasy (non-descript cover models that look tough with their weapons and tattoos), the cover came off as a little simple. And it didn't really connect with the stories. Nothing specific from the story is reflected in the cover. Overall: 3 StarsDisclosure: I bought this book for my own enjoyment."}, {"userName": "Suzanne (Under the Covers Book blog)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3575839-suzanne-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "Megan Chase's new radio show promises to slay peoples personal demons...little did Megan know that the personal demons would take that as a threat. Although Megan is psychic she never expected to suddenly have demons knocking down her door because of the tacky tag line of her radio show, but with some nasty demons chasing her and a reporter on her case she has no choice but to accept the help of Greyson Dante, a demon claiming to be looking after her best interests...This book has been collecting dust on my bookshelves for years and even after reading the Downside Ghosts series, which I adore, I still didn't pick this up until recently; what a mistake. As, although I don't believe this is as good as Ms Kane's Downside Ghosts I thought it lacked the intensity and uniqueness, it has a charm all of its own.The charm probably came from Grey, a certain sexy fire demon who smouldered his way through the book and into Megan's life. I loved the relationship between the two of them, it simmered through most of the book leaving you guessing about his intentions right until the end.I really enjoyed the world that has been created as well and I can't wait to find out more in the next book, although we weren't given much information about the world of demons, there was enough to make me eager to learn more.This is a good beginning to an interesting series and I will definitely be reading on."}, {"userName": "Sharon \u221e\u2765 is an emotional book junkie \u2765\u221e ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3275325-sharon-is-an-emotional-book-junkie", "userReview": "Wow...this book really sucked me in. I love books that pull you in so much you lose track of what's going on IRL. I really enjoyed Downside Ghosts and was really curious about this series but for some reason, I didn't think it would be as good. I was sooo wrong! This book was a little dark for me. I guess the whole \"creatures in the dark coming to get you\" along with people trying to deal with voices in their heads telling them to do evil things was the main factor. I enjoyed Megan's journey in trying to figure things out and to coming to terms with that even though she's done some selfish things at times, she's really a good person.I loved her and Greyson. It bust me up that he was always trying to get her into bed especially after she rubbed his \"spikes\"! That was so hilarious....it makes me smile every time I think about it. The sex scene was great and I loved how Megan thought she wouldn't be able to see fire and not think of him.The Brothers Brown were great! When they first showed up, I had no idea how much of an impact they would make on Megan's life and how much they would come to care for her. I guess that goes for Brian and Tera too.

You know, not too heavy duty. As you on though, there is definitely some horrific moments. It's all tempered with a bit of romance and some humor. The main character, Megan is a psychologist who can see demons. She tries to keep this part of her talent quiet, but things are coming to a head for her. Her boss talks her into a radio show and after the publicity of that, things come after her, small demons, zombies, a man-sized demon (a handsome devil who's quite attractive to her) as well as a nosy reporter. Seems there is also something from her past that is catching up with her. Without getting into spoiler terrirtory (though I'm probably the last one to read this book) things get more and more intense for Megan, more horrific for her and her friends. Great book, interesting ending and some sex action. My favorite side characters are \"the boys\", three brother demons sent to help protect Megan. They are cockney with wonderful fashion sense. I enjoyed this book a lot, and when I was finished wondered why I waited so long to read this."}, {"userName": "Cherie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1019558-cherie", "userReview": "Megan Chase is host to a new radio show that promises to help callers slay their demons.
