He had died in a suicidal charge against the English along with his men. The Prince took up Luxembourg\u2019s badge of a silver ostrich feather and resolved to use it as his own. The heraldic background was black: the possible origin of his later sobriquet, the Black Prince.There are other theories. The most banal is that the young Prince\u2019s armour in 1346 was black. Shakespeare, more convincingly, suggested it was the name the French gave him for the black deeds he later committed during his period of the Hundred Years War. It was, perhaps, a combination of factors. The black background to the silver Prince of Wales feathers would have been the dominant colour of his livery, while the French had good reason to fear the brilliant English commander who pillaged their towns and routed their armies. In one French tapestry he was depicted with a demon\u2019s horns.The tension between hero and villain expressed in the Black Prince\u2019s sobriquet existed also in the man. He was a killer with conscious: eternal judgment feeling very immediate to a warrior from a generation that had lived through the arrival of the bubonic plague. It was two years after Crecy, in 1348, and the Black Prince was eighteen when the epidemic reached England. In Bristol, a chronicler noted, \u2018Few survived more than two or three days\u2019. As the plague spread, and killed between 1/3 and \u00bd of the population, the crops were left unharvested and livestock untended. 5000 dead sheep were spotted in one field alone. In London, the uncleaned streets ran with human waste, and processions of Flagellants, whipped their naked torsos with nail studded rope, crying out to God for mercy, as their blood mixed with the faeces at their feet. It was while this epidemic was at its height, in 1349, that the Prince\u2019s father, Edward III, inaugurated the chivalric Order of the Garter at Windsor Castle. Selection was based on acts of valour, but the statues of the Order were primarily religious. These warriors knew death that could come suddenly, as it did with the plague, and they feared what came next - if not hell, then purgatory, where they would suffer for their sins, until they were \u2018burned\u2019 clean of them. They knew they should avoid doing evil, but it was a comfort to know that their fellow Garter knights were bound to have Masses said for their soul to help speed their passage through purgatory\u2019s fires. It guaranteed them around 5000 Masses within three months of their death. Some knights must have needed quite a lot help getting out of purgatory as God surely took a dimmer view of their past crimes than their commanders sometimes did. The Black Prince was prepared to overlook assault, housebreaking and abduction, in return for a man\u2019s sword. Yet he also aspired to be a true Christian knight. This meant showing not only courage in battle, but also mercy to his defeated enemies, generosity to friends and the carrying out of acts of piety. Unfortunately it was necessary sometimes to be brutal to ordinary townsfolk to demonstrate that their French lords could not protect them. Similarly, generosity to friends, and acts of piety - such as the Prince\u2019s desire to found a Cistercian Abbey bigger even than Fountains in Yorkshire - necessitated placing financial pressure on his tenants. A Prince couldn\u2019t let appearances slip (indeed it is appropriate that his biography is exquisitely produced and illustrated) . Wearing black was cool, even in the middle ages, for it was an expensive dye - but the Black Prince, also liked cloth made with pure gold thread and silk embroidered with pearlsOne medieval cleric sneered that the vanity of the warrior class was such that they risked tripping up on their long tunics. But there was no danger of that with the Black Prince. His tailor was so good that he knighted him in front of his army, before spending eleven days spent wreaking havoc on the Count of Armagnac\u2019s estates. Michael Jones brilliantly brings to life the campaigns and battles that made the Black Prince\u2019s name. At Poitiers in 1356 he broke all the rules of contemporary tactics, ordering a frontal assault on the forces of the French king, John II, while sending other cavalry to attack from the rear. He joined the head on attack, where a contemporary describes him \u2018hewing at the enemy, lifting up his fallen comrades\u2019. John II fought back with, \u2018 a great axe ..in the thickest press of his enemies\u2019. Around the king, \u2018The standards wavered and the standard bearers fell. Some were trampled upon, their innards torn open, some spat out their own teeth. Many were stuck to the ground, impaled\u2019. Eventually John II was captured, and brought to England a prisoner. This victory was celebrated with a Garter tournament attended by Edward III and the queen dowager, Isabella. Some of the most colourful passages in Black Prince concern his adoring grandmother. Her husband, the homosexual Edward II, had preferred the company of Hugh Despenser who, it was said, lead \u2018the monarch around as of he were teasing a cat with a piece of straw\u2019. In due course Isabella was revenged. Despenser had his penis cut off before being castrated and disemboweled, while Edward II was, reputedly, sodomised to death with a hot poker. She now regretted some of this and planned to be buried near Edward II, and in her wedding dress. Jones\u2019s book features other women almost as intriguing as Isabella. Edward III\u2019s last mistress, Alice Perrers, was only a teenager when the relationship began, but appears to have woven a similar spell over the old King to that Despenser had held over Edward II. Then there is the Black Prince\u2019s beautiful wife Jeanette, who married in scarlet, had a penchant for slutty dresses, and to whom he would write loving letters from the front.It is, however, the drama of the battles and the moral fog of war that dominate the narrative: the nobility of the love soldiers have for each other, and the sometimes base brutality of their acts of slaughter. The Black Prince\u2019s last years were spent in poor health, both physical, and, it seems, mental. The hero and the villain were one man and Michael Jones does justice to this complexity, while also giving us a gripping story in which we beat the French An edited version of this review appeared in the Times"}, {"userName": "David Santiuste", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3238587-david-santiuste", "userReview": "Michael Jones\u2019s most recent book retells the story of Edward of Woodstock, Prince of Wales, who is better known today as the Black Prince. Raised to be a warrior in the mould of his father, King Edward III, the Prince \u2018won his spurs\u2019 in battle at the tender age of sixteen. At Cr\u00e9cy he commanded a hard-pressed division of the English army, and thereafter his life was dominated by conflict with France. By the age of twenty-six, when he won a spectacular victory at the Battle of Poitiers, he had established himself as one of the greatest soldiers of his time. The Prince also caused a stir when he appears to have married for love, choosing as his bride the beautiful Joan of Kent. (Evidently he was willing to overlook Joan\u2019s controversial past.)In the summer of 1362, when the Prince was in his early thirties, he was entrusted by his father with the rule of Aquitaine (which at this point owed allegiance to the English king). While this was intended as a great honour, it proved to be a challenging task. The aristocracy of the region were notoriously fractious, and the Prince also became embroiled in a civil war in Spain. In 1367 he restored Pedro \u2018the Cruel\u2019 to the throne of Castile, although the Spanish king proved to be a fickle ally and his second reign was soon cut short. The expedition had important repercussions as its costs were enormous \u2013 and Pedro failed to pay his debts. Struggling to make ends meet, the Prince was forced to resort to unpopular taxation. This led to widespread resentment throughout his French domains.The Spanish campaign was pivotal in another important respect, as it appears to have affected the Prince\u2019s health. He began to show the first signs of an illness that would ultimately claim his life. By the autumn of 1369 he was reduced to travelling in a litter, but he was determined to lead his men in one last campaign. His target was the city of Limoges, whose lord (the bishop) had defected to the French king. Limoges was swiftly retaken, and according to the chronicler Jean Froissart over 3,000 of the city\u2019s inhabitants were massacred; many historians have seen this as a stain on the Prince\u2019s glittering reputation. Early in 1371 he returned to England. In the years that followed the French gained the ascendancy in warfare, and in the Prince\u2019s absence much of Aquitaine was lost. He passed away in 1376, still only forty-five years old.The Black Prince had a dramatic career, and in Michael Jones he has found a worthy biographer. Naturally much of the book is taken up with the Prince\u2019s martial exploits, which Jones describes with authority and flair. His account of the Battle of Poitiers is particularly engaging. The Prince is depicted as a sound tactician \u2013 one who remained calm in adversity and was willing to listen to advice \u2013 but also as a charismatic leader who could inspire his men to extraordinary feats of arms. For medieval people, it seems, the Prince\u2019s appeal lay in his genuine commitment to the ethos of chivalry, with its emphasis on prowess, loyalty, courtesy and piety. Jones argues persuasively that these core values formed the guiding principles of the Black Prince\u2019s life.On the whole, this is an admirably clear account, but it also conveys a deep sense of emotion; Jones appears to feel great sympathy for the Prince, whom he obviously admires. Nevertheless, he does not flinch from explaining how the Prince\u2019s choices sometimes led to difficulties of his own making. He also acknowledges that the Prince could be a harsh master, especially in the pursuit of funds to pay for his extravagant lifestyle and incessant campaigns. The Prince was ruthless in exacting dues from his tenants in Cheshire, for example; this was something he regretted in his last days, as he attempted to make his peace with God. Yet we also gain a strong impression of a man who was always conscious of his responsibilities as well as his rights. Some of the most interesting passages in the book are concerned with the Prince\u2019s exercise of lordship in Aquitaine, where he often emerges as more diligent and effective than is usually allowed.Jones builds upon the work of other historians (notably Guilhem P\u00e9pin) to offer a full reassessment of Froissart\u2019s description of the siege of Limoges, ultimately concluding that his account of a \u2018massacre\u2019 should be dismissed as fiction. However, this is not the only occasion when the Prince\u2019s reputation has suffered at Froissart\u2019s hands. Following the chronicler, the Prince\u2019s Spanish campaign has often been portrayed as an act of hubris in which he overreached himself. In fact, it would seem the Prince had serious misgivings about the enterprise \u2013 not least because he despised Pedro of Castile, whose character was the antithesis of all the values he held most dear. Jones makes a convincing case that it was Edward III, not his son, who was the driving force behind the English intervention in Spain. For me, this is the most affecting part of the book, as we see the Prince struggling to balance the obligation of loyalty to his father with his wider sense of chivalric ethics.Jones also captures the essence of how the Spanish campaign cast a dark shadow over the rest of the Prince\u2019s life. Not only did he contract his mortal illness at this time, the expedition set in train a chain of events which eventually led to a breach between the Prince and his father (with both men seemingly blaming the other for the change in their fortunes). While he could still take pride in his achievements (as witnessed by the plans for his splendid tomb), his last years make for sad reading, as both the Prince and King Edward struggled to cope with the waning of their powers. It is pleasing to think they might have reconciled before the end.I found this book a gripping read; it has that \u2018just one more chapter\u2019 quality that keeps you going late into the night. Moreover, while it seems likely that some of Jones\u2019s conclusions will lead to further debate, it must be stressed that his work is based on extensive scholarship (including his own archival research). He provides a compelling and humane portrait of a medieval warrior, bringing the Black Prince and his world triumphantly to life.[This review is also available at https://davidsantiuste.com/]"}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68424191-katie", "userReview": "The Black Prince gives us one of the most interesting \"what ifs\" of the Medieval period. What if he hadn't got sick and had lived to become Edward IV? No deposition of Richard II? No Lancaster kings? no Wars of the Roses? And he would have easily outshone his ancestor Richard the Lionheart.This biography of Edward is detailed and rich. There's obviously a lot of focus on the prince's military endeavours and these parts can be a bit dry at times, but overall it's a fascinating story.The Black Prince is the personification of chivalry and how we imagine a Medieval warrior...Tall, handsome, married to a beautiful woman, intelligent, strategic, diplomatic, and highly skilled in the art of war.The fact that, at the height of his popularity, he could have married any woman in the known world and yet he chose Joan of Kent for love makes me like him even more! It's a shame she didn't feature a bit more in the book.the Black Prince stayed popular as well, unlike his father, and inspired respect and loyalty in all his subjects. Even the French King held a memorial for him after his death.A brilliant man, and a great book."}, {"userName": "Tom Wood", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5295556-tom-wood", "userReview": "An effortlessly readable and continuously fascinating account of the extraordinary life of the Prince of Wales."}, {"userName": "RJay", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6204894-rjay", "userReview": "What pleased me most about this book was the author's wish bring the Black Prince to life for readers. In my opinion, historians have portrayed him rather flat, almost like a cardboard cutout and not a real person. I've read the other biographies of the Black Prince as well and while most document his life from start to finish, based on accounts and chronicles, they just don't do the man justice. I had hoped this new Michael Jones biography would do that. Jones should be applauded for shedding new light on the prince's reign in Aquitaine, presenting materials which reflect a more balanced view of the prince's governing there, which contradicts the tradionally-held view. In addition, he presents compelling information behind the prince's decision to support Pedro the Cruel, for which the prince has been criticized historically. I would have rated this book higher but for two reasons: 1) While Jones fleshes out certain aspects of the prince's life, I felt certain important periods/decisions were skimmed over. The book seemed to present in-depth 'snapshots' rather than an encompassing view. 2) Jones presents an alternative 'take' on Joan of Kent's marriage to Thomas Holland suggesting that rather than believing the couple were secretly married in 1340, an alternative scenario could be constructed. My question was and is, by whom? Jones does not say. He doesn't attribute this 'alternative' version to anyone, which in my opinion, makes it extremely suspect and flies in the face of good research. Where is the supporting documentation? What are the sources? Jones does not address this issue in his Chapter Notes nor does he appear to have taken Penny Lawne's in-depth biography of Joan of Kent into serious consideration, although it is listed in his bibliography. I respect Michael Jones immensely and hope others will read this work and comment accordingly."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16515542-linda", "userReview": "I love history and biography and English history has always appealed. However as you read medieval English history you can get somewhat bogged down as you try and keep all the people straight. This new biography of Edward, Prince of Wales, known to us as the Black Prince is enlightening and interesting and also full of people who make you slow down and try and put all the pieces together. The son and heir of Edward III who was a much better king than his father Edward II, the Black Prince was raised to be a chivalrous warrior and he met these expectations his whole life. Born in 1330 at Woodstock, he was the first in a large family born to Edward III and Philippa of Hainault. When he was 16, he had his first command at the battle of Crecy and was very successful. From then on he was a major commander of military expeditions sent to France as his father sought to gain land - and perhaps even the kingship of France. This is the beginning of what would become the Hundred Years Wars between France and England and under the Black Prince, England gained land and power for a time. A very generous and pious person, the Black Prince was good at war and people but not that good at finance. He overspent his entire life and the constant war he and his father pursued eventually was their downfall. This was also when the black plague swept through Europe and this affected the ability of England to pay for these costly wars. In his forties, the Black Prince was afflicted with an illness that consumed the last years of his life. The English throne would eventually go to his young son Richard and the glorious warrior days of Edward III and his son the Black Prince would be only a memory."}, {"userName": "ClareT", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54976569-claret", "userReview": "The Black Prince has made some guest appearances in books I have recently read, so I was excited to find that a book had been written about his life. In some ways I was disappointed, not in the writing, that was excellent, but in the breadth of the material covered.The early part of the book is really about Edward III, rather than his first born son. Most of the rest of the book is about his famous battles. There isn't much about his early life really, and I'm not sure there is much to be learned about his personality. Maybe he wasn't that complex? But, he does come across as quite likeable, much more so than some of his contemporaries.As I was reading airline myself thinking, oh no, not anther battle. But the author has written about the battles; Credy, Poitiers, Najera, Limoges, in such an engaging way that I found myself turning the page wanting to know more about the tactics and how the battle progressed.There's quite a lot to enjoy about the book and the author has told the story well despite the lack of a story to tell after all, he died at the age of 46, and he makes good use of primary and secondary sources and differentiates well between them.An enjoyable read, not sure it's one my mother-in-law is likely to enjoy though as it is too dominated by medieval warfare."}, {"userName": "Sandi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11085832-sandi", "userReview": "Good book about medieval England.
