In this particular story, the average roles of a grandpa and his grandson are reversed. In the beginning, it is shown that the grandpa is coming over to play and the boy immediately says, \u201cBabysitting a grandpa is fun-if you know how.\u201d From that sentence, you are then aware what the book is going to be about. They first begin by playing hide and seek, then the parents leave the house and the grandson is there to comfort his grandpa incase he is sad about their departure as a young child would be. Then, he begins to list the snacks that a grandpa would enjoy. They continue to do multiple activities and each is written in a how-to form. Lists begin with titles like, what to do on a walk, How to Entertain A Grandpa, How to play with a Grandpa, and What to Draw for a Grandpa. After a long day of watching over his grandpa, the young boy makes a list on \u201cHow to Say Goodbye to A Grandpa\u201d. How to Babysit A Grandpa by Jean Reagan is written in how-to style writing. The layout of the book is in a sequence from the beginning of the day to the end. It covers all the basics of what to do when babysitting a grandpa. The designs are all very colorful and playful that goes along with the theme of the story and introduces each new topic as it is listed. Text/Author Elements:The theme of this story is about young children and their relationship with their grandparents. It is told completely from the grandson\u2019s perspective because many of the topics are relatable to young children such as eating things like ice cream and ketchup, the game of hide and seek, and doing summersaults. It shows that children are capable to caring for people just like their parents and grandparents do for them. The grandson is in complete control and is shown to care for his grandpa in every way. This story connects to the audience, which is young children but also parents and grandparents who are reading this book to their children or grandchildren. It provides a great way for them to bond and laugh together. This book is something that they are able to have in common.The book includes a great amount of creative elements starting from the very beginning when the back of the cover page and the first page are covered in paintings done by the grandson showing each activity that goes on in the story. Also, each step that is listed is something that a young child can very much relate too. They are very creative topics that are designed to capture the attention of the child and add a sense of humor. The mood of the story is very fun and lighthearted the whole way through. There is never a dull moment. It is very quick and precise because children are usually seen to be very energetic and excited about everything and while reading the story you are able to get a sense of that mood. Comments throughout the story such as; \u201cDon\u2019t worry. They always come back.\u201d Then right away, ask him if he\u2019s hungry.\u201d It shows that he does not like wasting any time and everything is very to the point. There is not much character development with the grandson in the story. Throughout the entire story, he is shown to be energetic, and very capable of knowing how to take care of his grandpa. Although, there is a small amount of character development shown in the grandpa because from the beginning he seems to be very content and excited with the activities his grandson is providing. He then becomes very tired and seems to be exhausted from everything. Then, it is shown in his facial expressions and detail that he gets frustrated with this grandson. The story is then concluded with a very content grandson and grandfather. The author of this children\u2019s book, Jean Reagan, wrote this book for her two children and their grandparents. In order to get the specific ideas for this story she directly asked and watched her children and her parents to decide what activities they mostly enjoy together. Although she was inspired by many other creative stories her children had to share, there just was not enough room for them all. Throughout the story, it does not include any page numbers. This book was published in 2012 and was such a success that became an inspiration for six other how-to series. A critic for the Deseret News, Marilou Sorensen, commented this on the book, Salt Lake City author Jean Reagan has captured the child voice with perfection. The relationship of little boy with his grandfather is real \u2014 no patronizing phrases tucked in by an adult trying to capture the child-like quality. There\u2019s never subtle attempts to clarify who is babysitting who; the child reader will get it.Another critic, Kim Tomsic, from the Bookshelf Detective website adds, \u201cHOW TO BABYSIT A GRANDPA by Jean Reagan (illustrated by Lee Wildish) is one of the most delightful picture books available in the market. With every page turn, parent and child will experience laughter and amusement. Furthermore, if the premise isn't enough to satisfy a reader (it is!), the gorgeous and amusing illustrations will surely win you over.\u201dDesign/Illustrative Elements: The author of the book How to Babysit a Grandpa is Jean Reagan. The illustrations in this book are very bright and colorful but also very soft and subtle. The text and story line are exciting and busy enough that the illustrations are better to be less flashy. None of the characters are very detailed but they do not need to be. You are able to understand the emotion and mood of each of them from the text itself. The style of illustrations in this story would be classified as, abstract. The illustrations are very unrealistic but also playful and fun as well. The characters bodies are not proportionate to a body in real life but add a sense of humor and silliness to the story. He says that the characters in the stories are his main focus when illustrating which is very obvious throughout this short story. Although there is not much detail, they are very well done and show the love and care between the grandpa and grandson. Most, if not all of the illustrations throughout this book are shown from the readers view point. In most of the pictures it is almost as if we are sitting right there with them. Although nothing is really done with very much detail, having the picture so close up gives a more interesting point of view because it is almost as if we are there with them analyzing what is going on. The main characters, the grandfather and the grandson, are the only two people shown throughout the story with the exception of the parents. Showing them leaving so that the grandfather and grandson are the only two people at the house. The illustrator, Lee Wildish, did a very good job with directing the reader\u2019s attention to the most important part of the story, which are the activities that the grandson actually has his grandpa doing. It is explained in the text and then shown in the illustration, which gives us the ability to not have to imagine it in our heads and see it first hand. It gives a sense of emotion to the story and also humor. There are also other small illustrations added to each of the pages that the reader might not notice at first glance such as the plate of cookies, the cat, or the two lizards always making some sort of facial expression. For a child, that is a very exciting surprise to see those things being repeated throughout the story along with everything else that is going on. Although the facial expressions of each of the characters are not very detailed or distinct, you are able to understand the mood and attitude of each of the characters. Specifically the grandpa, from the beginning you are able to tell that he is very laid back, calm, and content with whatever is going to happen which Is very relatable to most grandparents from a young child\u2019s point of view. The grandparents are usually very easy going with their young grandchildren because they are very intrigued with their creativity and energy. The illustrations show great exaggeration with the body parts of each of the characters. The grandfather is shown to be a bit larger and rounder and this gives a sense of comfort and love towards his character. Each character has very light facial features, which makes the story feel more easy-going and lighthearted. Lee Wildish, a freelance illustrator, is one of the most unique children\u2019s book illustrators because he was one of the first to start trade publishing with a digital style. This was helpful to his illustrations because it allowed him to have the texture and quality of real art but the bright quality of the digital illustrations. This book reached the number two spot on the New York Times best seller list, won Crystal Kite Member Choice Award in 2013, and the Kids Independent next list award in 2012. Marilou Sorensen from the Desert News also included this about the illustrator, \u201cWildish\u2019s animated, digitally created illustrations, even on the endpapers, complement this tender story and takes it one step further with additional characters (a kitten snoozing on grandpa\u2019s head, lizards that appear in unlikely places) and interesting details.\u201dA critic who wrote in depth about this children\u2019s book on her blog commented, \u201cThe illustrator (Lee Wildish) did a wonderful job at displaying the story that Jean wrote. The characters drawn are warm and cuddle, and we all like their spaghetti legs. There are cute animals in the book too, and the jacket artwork (drawings the little boy did for his grandpa) is endearing.\u201dRead Aloud: For the Read Aloud section, I read this story to the two young children I babysit for. They are two years old and four years old-the perfect age for this book. It is a very fun and exciting book to read to them because they particularly have a very good relationship with their grandparents and are always going over there to be \u201cbabysat\u201d by them. They are able to find it humorous because they know that the roles are reversed in this story and the activities are things that they find interesting. They would laugh as I read the list of things to do while babysitting a grandpa. They would reply, \u201cThat is sooo silly!\u201d They were easily able to point out the grandpa\u2019s reaction to each of the activities. The first thing they both pointed out is, \u201cWe don\u2019t babysit out grandpa!\u201d How to Babysit A Grandpa by Jean Reagan is a very humorous, fun, exciting story that will attract the interest of any young child and also help to build a relationship between grandparents and their grandchildren. I enjoyed the how-to style writing because it made the story very humorous and enjoyable to read out loud. It is such a simple topic but was created into something very relatable to parents, grandparents, and young children. It was very accurate because the author\u2019s children and their experiences inspired each subject with their grandparents. The illustrations added another element of love and excitement with the soft but bright colors and the small characters incorporated into each page."}, {"userName": "Bree", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77116638-bree", "userReview": "Summary In this story, a little boy tells us how to properly babysit a grandpa.
