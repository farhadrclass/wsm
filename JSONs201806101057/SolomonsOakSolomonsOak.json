Here she had shared a wonderful time with her husband Dan\u2014until he abruptly and unexpectedly died.Putting her life and her finances back together in the year afterwards comes to be her biggest challenge yet. But near the old oak tree is a small chapel her husband built. And an unconventional couple pleads with Glory to allow them to have their \"pirates wedding\" there. From this beginning, a new business of hosting weddings for unconventional couples is born.And on that first day, she meets two other damaged souls: Juniper McGuire, a broken teen, abandoned by her family and the plight that took them under; and ex-cop Joseph Vigil, wounded and still in critical pain, who drops onto the scene unexpectedly to photograph the oak tree.Juniper is Glory's latest foster child (and first girl), and even though they almost immediately connect, there is so much trouble on the horizon. Will Glory be able to improve this girl's life without taking herself down too? And what will the newly developing bond between her and Joseph bring into their lives? And how will Glory's rescue dogs and horses add or subtract from the scene?Watching Glory's struggles with Juniper was the most enjoyable part of the story to me. And while the somewhat predictable romance brewing between Glory and Joseph felt like something that could and even should happen, I didn't really \"feel\" any chemistry between them. To me, it just seemed like one of those plot points that was tossed in there to give Glory something to help her move on. Which is why I deducted one star.What I loved most about \"Solomon's Oak: A Novel\" was the descriptive language that brought the oak tree alive until I could almost see it bending over the people in its wake, as if it were some kind of warm, embracing, and spiritual presence.A four star read that is sure to captivate many, \"Solomon's Oak: A Novel\" was definitely an unforgettable read."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2673817-denise", "userReview": "Another beautiful book from Jo-Ann Mapson! Solomon's Oak is an ancient white oak, growing in California, where no white oak should be able to grow. When Glory Solomon is widowed at an early age she unwittingly becomes its caretaker. Her new foster daughter, Juniper, arrives just as Glory is hosting her first wedding in the chapel her husband built under its branches. Close on Juniper's heels comes Joesph, an injured cop who is there to photograph the famous tree. Together, the three of them will weave a story of healing under the patient gaze of the ancient tree.I absolutely fell in love with this book from the very beginning! The background is laid with rich California history, it is fleshed out with flawed, realistic, deeply felt characters, and finished off with a perfectly paced plot. I was especially impressed with the rendering of Juniper, a deeply troubled teenage girl. Jo-Ann Mapson gets just right the fierce emotions, hot and cold temper, striking intelligence and complete lack of common sense that is a teenage girl. Everything that is infuriating and lovable is there. She also perfectly captured how three emotionally wounded people can together pull each other out of the pain and find the way back into life. Sorry if I'm gushing, but I loved this book! Arguably one of Jo-Ann Mapson's best!"}, {"userName": "Petunia", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5981633-petunia", "userReview": "Mapson is an author I turn to like comfort food when I get tired of rich fare. Her chaaracters are real people with flaws, ones you can love and appreciate. In Solomon's Oak, Glory is a grieving widow whose's part-time job at Target might provide just enough money to get by--if she didn't take in strays. Glory and her husband of ten years had fostered teenaged boys, whome they loved and sent on their way better prepared for life. She also fosters dogs, that she loves and trains for a permanent home. Why not? The dogs don't eat as much as her horses, they have space to run, and they help take Glory's mind off her loss. Glory's already short of time, money, and energy, when she agrees to foster a teenage girl--a troubled vulnerable girl who lies--but Glory won't say no. She starts a wedding business to help with the bills; she can cook and organize but she's no good with a camera. Luckily for all involved, Joseph, an amateur photographer, is visiting from Albuquerque to take ictures of California trees, one of which, the Solomon oak is on Glory's property. But Joseph is also an injured cop, slowly recuperating, and planning to leave soon. Is he the man for Glory or is Joseph another stray? Maspson has an excellent back list too; all are recommended for readers who want a well-written, intelligent, cointemporary romance and friendship story."}, {"userName": "Lucia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6637160-lucia", "userReview": "It was an enjoyable book, except for the lame use of Spanish all over the book.

It is an easy, well written novel that follows the lives of three individuals whose lives intertwine in interesting ways.Glory Solomon is a widow coming up on the first anniversary of her late husband\u2019s death. She is asked by a couple if they can have their wedding at the chapel that her husband finished building shortly before his death. She accepts after she discovers the reason that the couple has been turned down by every other church is that they want a pirate themed ceremony.Meanwhile, Glory is asked by social worker/friend Caroline (whose motives become known later in the book) if she can host a troubled 14 year old named Juniper for the night until she can find a \u201cforever home\u201d for the girl. Glory hesitantly agrees. During the aforementioned pirate nuptials, former forensic lab worker Joseph Vigil is taking pictures of the famed Solomon\u2019s Oak when he sees a duel during the ceremony and his police instinct kicks in. He crashes the wedding and draws his gun, demanding that the dueling swordsmen drop their weapons. Glory quickly cuts in and explains that it is all part of the ceremony and calms the situation. Joseph, now embarrassed, holsters his gun and apologizes for his instinct overtaking him. Fortunately for Glory, whose camera isn\u2019t working, Joseph agrees to take pictures of the ceremony in exchange for a plate of leftovers to take home.From there, Glory, Juniper, and Joseph\u2019s lives are brought together in interesting ways. Glory struggles to form a relationship with Juniper, whom she truly believes in and wants to help, but can't seem to get a grasp on it. Joseph becomes an unlikely hero, if you will, in the situation and helps bring Juniper and Glory together and closer than they would've imagined.As I said, I thought this book would be better. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it is good, just not as good as I was expecting. The historical tidbits are accurate, the writing is great, and the ending is very fitting and a great conclusion, but my expectations were higher."}, {"userName": "Regina Spiker", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4274600-regina-spiker", "userReview": "Solomon's Oak - the words alone invoke strength and character...photographers come from miles away to capture the beauty of the lovely, huge White oak that sits on Solomon's farm in California, where White Oaks should never grow.

Now alone with only her horses and dogs, Glory is faced with the dilemma of possibly losing the farm.

Unlucky for a her, a former policeman (with a body and a mind full of pain), Joseph happens to arrive when the \"pirates\" are at their worst - with guns and swords drawn!

First of all, I fell in love with the idea of Solomon's Oak being a tree that was not expected to live, let alone flourish for hundreds of years in their area. I absolutely adored the character of Glory Solomon since, like me, shoe loves animals. She has three dogs who she rescued and has trained to help her out on the farm. She also has s couple of horses. She is grieving the loss of her husband of twenty years. Now she wishes that they had children of their own in addition to the sons they fostered over those twenty years. She is working at Target and trying to get creative and begin a new business to keep up with her financial obligations when caseworker Caroline calls and asks her to keep a young lady named Juniper, just overnight. Juniper is alone now since her father has disappeared and her mother died after Juniper's sister, Casey, went missing one day while walking her dog. Guess what? Glory rescued Casey's dog and named him Cadillac. When he and Juniper are reunited, it feels as if they were meant to be together. However, Glory has a lot of doubt about whether she can raise this girl without the help of her beloved husband, Dan. Throw in an ex-cop on a disability who is visiting the area and ends up rescuing Glory when her camera isn't working and this is a great story."}, {"userName": "Grace", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2395921-grace", "userReview": "Liked the characters - a new widow, a foster child, a retired policeman - great relationships.

When Glory's husband Dan was alive, they took in foster children, but Juniper may be more than she can handle alone.

Juniper, the foster child has a voice that rings true for children who have seen too much sorrow and abandonment. Joseph is recovering from a police shooting and from losing his long time best friend. He is in California to spend some time in his grandmother's cabin to reconnect before it is demolished to make way for a new development. These three characters are able to connect after significant effort and mis-steps. I was happy to spend some time with them and see the connections grow.

And the plot was compelling, though there were probably too many coincidences, such as the fact that the heroine becomes the foster mother to the sister of a missing person whose dog lives at Solomon's Oak. And how did she become a foster mother without going through months of red tape, especially in California?I have enjoyed other books by this author, but somehow the writing wasn't quite good enough to rate 4 stars. It had a thrown-together quality. Nevertheless, it certainly qualifies as a good read, especially for \"chick lit\" fans. I liked it much better than Michael Cunningham's \"By Nightfall,\" a highly acclaimed novel, which I read last week. That book was beautifully written, but populated by self-absorbed people about whom it was hard to care."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/546484-anne", "userReview": "I finished reading Solomon's Oak this evening, and on the whole I did enjoy the story. The story is pretty slow to start, with a gentle introduction to each character, and although the pace never becomes particularly fast, the characters develop wonderfully. Although recommended by Jodi Picoult, Jo-Ann Mapson's writing and style is really not similar to Picoult at all. This didn't put me off, but some readers may be looking for a similar genre and be disappointed. The three main characters; Glory, Juniper and Joseph take turns to narrate the story, which is basically a small-town tale about three people who are very different, but have sadness and loss in common. Throw in some rescue dogs with gigantic characters of their own and a cast of supporting characters, a wedding chapel and some tasty sounding food and you are left with a heart-warming, well written story."}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4900962-diana", "userReview": "Jo-Ann Mapson is one of my favorite authors.

Jo-Ann Mapson beautifully, if slowly and often predictably, maps the spaces between Glory, a recent, struggling widow, and Juniper, her happenstance foster daughter, as deftly as she fills out their piecemeal lives on a California ranch. The titular tree, which shouldn't even grow in that part of the country, never mind for over two hundred years, anchors the story that undulates around it, collecting oddball and stalwart characters as treasures and trash catch in its branches.

However, it doesn't paint a rosy picture of the challenges the parents face nor does it give a watered down perspective of the real trauma that the child endures and the scars this placed on them. I feel this book is one of survival and endurance on all the main characters so it's very appropriate to compare them to the oak tree.The only part I had an issue with was at times the book seem disjointed, there seemed to be times when it needed a smoother transition between topics. However this is a minor criticism and I feel the ultimate message of the book makes up for this. It points out that not all foster parents are bad, that no child is hopeless and that the social stigma against children in foster care is alive and well."}, {"userName": "D.j.
