It was a Locus Award nominee for Best SF novel in 2008 (Michael Chabon\u2019s The Yiddish Policeman\u2019s Union won that year) and was also a nominee for 2007 best novel by The British Science Fiction Association (BSFA) (Ken MacLeod\u2019s The Night Sessions won). It is simply a very, very good science fiction novel.As a part of the Revelation Space future history, it is set in the Glitter Band, a collection of semi-autonomous habitats orbiting the distant planet of Yellowstone. Describing the Glitter Band\u2019s hundreds of millions of inhabitants and their ten thousand separate habitats provides Reynolds and opportunity, literarily almost limitless, to explore varying socio-economic-political institutions. The Prefect includes a portrayal of a habitat where all of the citizens remain in a virtual reality stasis, another world where the residents exist in an almost complete egalitarian / anarchist society. All of the worlds share in common a universal voting system that decides overall Glitter Band policies as well as local decisions.Akin to Poul Anderson\u2019s Harvest of Stars series, people in Reynolds\u2019s Revelation Space universe have the ability to enjoy biological and neurological alterations. This ability provides Reynolds with a fascinating abundance of character models and sci-fi spectacle. Also like Anderson\u2019s earlier work, a person\u2019s intelligence and memory can be downloaded into another body or machineThe Prefect as a novel is a complex murder mystery that follows the exploits of Tom Dreyfus, a member of a special investigations police force called the Panoply that is responsible for policing the Glitter Band. Like his counterparts in Alien, Blade Runner and Outland, the reader follows Dreyfus through his investigations with Reynolds\u2019s masterful science fiction universe as a backdrop. Very good."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2465351-ian", "userReview": "This is not a book that\u2019s necessarily going to wow you. It\u2019s not flashy. It\u2019s not full of glitz or pizzazz. Basically this book ain\u2019t got much bling. But I\u2019ll tell you what this book does have: execution. The Prefect is thoughtfully and creatively designed, deceptively complex, and just plain well executed. Alastair Reynolds doesn\u2019t use any tricks. He just put together a solid game plan and executed it with precision and style.The Prefect makes me think of Stanford football\u2019s offense in the Andrew Luck era (it\u2019s Luck\u2019s senior season as I write this review). Stanford uses some misdirection and they love to shift and line up in unbalanced formations, but there\u2019s really nothing tricky or special going on; it\u2019s just classic power football, executed at a very high level. Stanford simply lines up and out-executes the opponent, marching down the field in what seems like modest chunks, then before the opponent realizes what\u2019s happened Stanford is up by 20 points.I would liken Iain Banks to LSU football under the \u201cMad Hatter\u201d Les Miles, athletic and tricky; Connie Willis, with her frantic pace that leaves the reader out of breath, looks like Oregon\u2019s no-huddle, quick-strike offense under Chip Kelly. Alastair Reynolds may lack the flair of those writers, but in The Prefect he lined up in the power-I, shifted the tight end, pulled the guard, and executed a perfect play.I don\u2019t mean to say The Prefect is simple. Like any good power offense it has its subtleties and complexities. Moreover, The Prefect has some unique angles on classic sci-fi themes that I enjoyed immensely. But The Prefect is anything but frustrating to follow; it weaves many threads and then brings those threads together at the end, tying them up in a neat and satisfying conclusion that leaves no questions unanswered. This is an impressively well executed book, gratifying from beginning to end. And it was worth my time, which, ultimately, is one of the best compliments I can pay.P.S. I suppose I should comment on the reading by John Lee, since this was, after all, the audiobook version. Mr. Lee has not been my favorite narrator in the past, though I\u2019ve found him competent. But in reading The Prefect he was much more than competent. Mr. Lee\u2019s gritty, streetwise style was perfectly suited for this book, and I can\u2019t imagine it being better read by anyone else. Well worth the Audible credit."}, {"userName": "David Sven", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8802423-david-sven", "userReview": "I loved it. My favourite Revelation Space novel to date. The only downside is it\u2019s the last one and my Rev space journey has ended \u2013 but it has ended very satisfactorily. And at least there are more Alastair Reynolds novels to explore. This is the second book in the series I have listened to on audio and I have to say, John Lee does an excellent job at narration. It\u2019s hard to describe how he adds to the overall tone of the book but I think he just adds a touch of sophistication, a touch of \u201cdark\u201d undertone, and a whole lot of \u201ccool.\u201d Unlike it\u2019s predecessors in the series, which start off slow in the first half, the pace in this book was off and running from the get go as we are introduced to Prefect Tom Dreyfuss, where he is effecting a lockdown of one of the ten thousand habitats orbiting planet Yellowstone. Dreyfuss, 007Tom Dreyfuss - licensed to euthanize, which includes the inflicting of permanent and irreversible death. Is there any other kind of death? Well...yes! After all, this is the 25th century and we are in the Glitter band, where even decapitation is not necessarily fatal or where you can have an electronic copy of yourself uploaded as a machine intelligence - there\u2019s dying and then there\u2019s dying.For those already familiar with the Revelation Space Universe (and I would recommend reading the first Revelation Space book and possibly Chasm City first, before getting to this book) our story is set in the Glitter Band, 100 odd years before it gets hit by the Melding Plague and turns into the Rust Belt. The Glitter Band is home to 100 million citizens living in orbit in tunnelled out asteroids and machine structures. We are at the height of the Belle Epoch, a time that is only referred to as a wistful memory in the dark ages that are the setting of the previous books. The contrast is rather refreshing and really really cool. I mean, this place is insane. It\u2019s the Demarchist Era so the system of government is a Demarchy (Democratic Anarchy). That means each of the Ten Thousand Habitats in orbit is pretty much autonomous and self governing. However, all decisions that relate to the whole are voted for or against on the fly via the External Abstraction - an advanced form of internet which most people are constantly connected to via implant or machine accessories.What this means is that no two habitats are alike. You can be assured to be spoiled for choice in deciding what sort of society you want to live in or what sort of lifestyle you want to lead. If you would rather be walking around in a body that is not baseline human \u2013 there\u2019s are habitats that can grow you animal parts \u2013 or parts that function more as weapons so you can compete in gladiatorial games and possibly experience non fatal death. Wha...?! Or if the real world is too much for you then you can opt to live purely in a virtual reality in the External Abstraction - In which case you won\u2019t need most of your body parts taking up room and consuming resources. Head and shoulders will suffice. Just park your brain on the shelf alongside the million or so other ones that are hooked into the machine. But maybe even virtual reality is not to your liking. Not a problem, you can join the \u201cPersistent Vegetative State.\u201d Or if you are bored with democracy and would like to experience what living in a dictatorship is like, there are habitats that offer a \u201cVoluntary Tyranny.\u201d So long as you are aware that checking into the Hotel California may be voluntary but, as the song goes...leaving might prove problematic.However, even a Democratic Anarchy needs some form of regulation. Enter into the mix, Panapoly - The police force elected to ensure that the voting apparatus isn\u2019t tampered with and illegally exploited and that the integrity of the machinery, Polling Cores, in each habitat remains intact. Of all the crimes in the Glitter Band, attempting to subvert the voting process is top of the list and will see you irreversibly killed and any digital copies of yourself erased.Anyway, that\u2019s the background, our story gets cracking pretty early when a habitat is annihilated and one of Panoply\u2019s top agents, Prefect Tom Dreyfuss, is sent in to investigate. And the pace just keeps ramping up as the Prefect discovers that things are a lot more serious than mere mass murder \u2013 oh yes they are. I was hooked from start to finish, never experiencing a moment when I didn\u2019t want to keep going to find out what happens next. Reynolds does an excellent job of maintaining the tension, and upping the ante as things escalate. There\u2019s mystery, there\u2019s action, there are villains, psychopaths (apart from some of the normal denizens of some of the habitats), Cyborg Ultras, Machine intelligences and some very cool space battles. And it would be remise of me not to mention my favourite weapon in the book \u2013 the Panoply standard issue \u201cWhiphound\u201d \u2013 It looks like a whip(except when it looks like a sword) and it\u2019s used like a police dog able to take instructions \u2013 I think you\u2019ll get a kick out of \u201cEnhanced Subject Compliance\u201d (torture) mode.I thought Chasm City would be hard to beat and I\u2019m still a little torn on which is my true favourite of the series, but either way, both are on my favourites shelf and I\u2019m giving this...5 stars"}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613919-jason", "userReview": "5 Stars The Prefect by Alastair Reynolds is a nearly perfect book to me. I finally had to conclude my time in the Revelation Space universe by reading this one the 7th and final book of the epic space opera. People nitpick Reynolds and complain about his writing. They claim that his characters are too thin, his prose too plain, and his plots too complex. Well let me tell you, even if some of those points ring true at times, there is no denying that Reynolds is a masterful storyteller and a giant among his peers. He writes hard science fiction novels without being too text book. He creates new and imaginative places that are easy to believe and are a gift for us to read. His long stories are truly page turners that you will have trouble putting down. The Prefect was impossible to put down.I loved this book because it really worked. I am normally not a fan of anything involving prequels, but in this case it truly worked. Having read 6 previous novels in the Revelation Space series I found myself in familiar territory. Knowing how things will be in the future added a huge weight to the story along with a feeling of dread and doom. I found myself wishing that our heroes could change the fate of the world as if things were not destined to be.The Prefect has many awesome characters, starting with our main protagonist Tom Dreyfus. He is surrounded by amazing people. The action is epic in it's scale and takes place from one end of The Glitter Band to the other. There are space fights and explorations. There is very little down time in this story. The Prefect has many awesome technologies and weapons to drool over. There is just tons to love.This will be one of my favorite reads of 2016.I loved it!I love Alastair Reynolds and consider him to be one of the very best science fiction writers.Awesome."}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30706026-gary", "userReview": "Reynolds\u2019 hybrid police procedural/space opera is great fun, if perhaps a little too frenzied in its plotting. Set in the Revelation Space universe, but about a century prior to the events of the main trilogy, The Prefect is about a law enforcement agency called Panoply, whose sole charge is to defend the democratic rights of citizens in the Glitter Band, a collection of thousands of human habitats in space. Senior Field Prefect Tom Dreyfus and his team investigate the shocking destruction of one of the Glitter Band\u2019s habitats, only to discover that the seemingly open and shut case is a cover for a conspiracy that threatens citizen rule of the entire Glitter Band.It is interesting to revisit Reynolds\u2019 earlier work after reading some of his more recent novels. The biggest flaw in his writing was always his characters. Not that he couldn\u2019t write interesting or sympathetic ones, but they tended to have a little bit of a black and white nature, as if they only behaved in accordance with their function in the story. The characters in his more recent work seem to have more complex inner lives and variable motives. The Prefect is good old-school Reynolds, though, and fed my nostalgia for the Rev Space universe nicely."}, {"userName": "Apatt", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt", "userReview": "Alastair Reynolds is an author I keep coming back to like a regular customer, for the simple reason that he is among the top three best sci-fi authors working today (I have no idea who the other two are, I just estimate that if I were to do a top three ranking he would be in it).The Prefect is set earlier in the Revelation Space timeline. This is not going to mean very much to anyone who has never read anything from Reynold\u2019s epic Revelation Space series. That said this is a standalone book in the sense that the story is complete in itself, not part of an ongoing narrative from other books. However, to get the most out of it I would recommend that you at least read the original Revelation Space novel first to familiarize yourself with the setting. The Prefect starts off as a kind of murder mystery where the protagonist Prefect Tom Dreyfus is investigating the mass murder of the occupants of a space habitat. A Prefect is a policeman of sorts, part of a security task force that specialize in protecting the voting system of The Glitter Band (a group of 10,000 habitats). As the story unfolds it transpire that the murder is merely the beginning of a hostile takeover bid of The Glitter Band by an AI entity.The worst thing about summarizing a Revelation Space book is that many concepts need to be explained to make any sense to the casual reader, a chore for the reviewer and the reader. It is probably more useful and practical to highlight the novel\u2019s qualities in general terms. The Prefect then is a fast paced story of a race against time to save a huge group of space habitats from being taken over and the citizenry from being wiped out. It is an action packed but fairly complex space opera, fans of weird future tech will have a field day with things like semi-sentient whips, decapitation surgery, irremovable insect-like devices attached to people, robot weevils etc.There are alien races in the Revelation Space universe but they are only mentioned in passing in this book. The variety of posthumans and AIs are weird enough. The characters are a little flat and generic by Reynolds\u2019 standard, probably due to more emphasis being placed on the plot. There is an interesting exploration of the theme of what constitute a human being. Is an activated backup human consciousness a human being with rights and a soul? Or is it just software? The cases for and against are quite well presented and Reynolds leave it for you to decide.Reynolds does not pretend to be a literary writer but I always like his clean prose style and believable dialogue. In his other books he sometimes wanders into more lyrical prose style territory but I did not notice any such passages in this book. He did however include an excellent explanation of a \u201cramscoop\u201d, a sci-fi conceit I never fully understood so I would like to quote it here:\u201cA starship built around a single massive engine designed to suck in interstellar hydrogen and use it for reaction mass. Because it didn\u2019t have to carry its own fuel around, it could go almost as fast as it liked, right up to the edge of light-speed.\u201dGenerally Reynolds explains the science behind his sci-fi more successfully than most sci-fi authors. Always an advantage with this kind of hard(ish) sci-fi.The Prefect then is another excellent piece of sci-fi from Alastair Reynolds who has yet to let me down. If space opera and sci-fi tech is your thing then this book can be highly recommended with the caveat that you have at least read Revelation Space first. For a completely standalone Reynolds book not connected to any other books, the awe-inspiring House of Suns is the best option and remains my favourite work of his.

By the time of the main trilogy Revelation Space (2000), Redemption Ark (2002), and Absolution Gap (2003), the Glitter Band of 10,000 orbitals has already been destroyed by the corrosive Melding Plague, so we see only its wrecked aftermath. With such tantalizing hints, it is only natural that readers would want to see more of the Glitter Band in its heyday, running the gamut of utopian, democratic, autocratic, escapist, and decadent societies.Fortunately, Reynolds explores this promising setting with a dark, complex, and compelling detective story filled with determined prefects (futuristic detectives), sinister AIs, post-human ultras, scheming factions, betrayals, revelations, tons of high-tech gadgets and tense action. It is an endless playground for a skilled SF writer with a rich imagination, much like Iain M. Banks in his CULTURE novels. The Prefect (2007) is a surprisingly satisfying mix of hard SF, police procedural, and space opera, all done in Reynolds\u2018 dense and claustrophobic style. After Chasm City (2001), I\u2019d say it\u2019s his best book set in the REVELATION SPACE universe.The story begins with prefect Tom Dreyfus investigating some polling violations, because this 10,000 orbital society is linked mainly by a network of polling stations that allows all the citizens to make decisions for the otherwise loosely-linked societies. Prefects are a group of specialized police that make sure the system is not tampered with and that all citizens have access to abstraction, an advanced form of virtual reality and access to the information shared among the 100-million plus members of the Glitter Band. Imagine a direct democracy in which technology allows all members to vote on a real-time basis on all decisions that affect them, without interfering with their daily lives. It\u2019s an often-contemplated utopian ideal, and Reynolds explores the implications in a far-future context which lends it more plausibility.Once Dreyfus moves to the next assignment to investigate the destruction of an entire habitat called Ruskin-Sartorius, which seems to have been sliced open by a Conjoiner drive, he quickly recognizes this is not a typical crime. In classic detective tradition, the deeper he delves into the details of the case, the stranger and more sinister the clues he unearths, always pointing to mysterious artificial intelligences that seem to be intent on either controlling or destroying the Glitter Band. What I found impressive was just how convoluted the plot became, with multiple nefarious AIs manipulating events for their own purposes, and the various humans who align themselves in an intricate web of intrigue. It takes a lot of concentration to keep track of all the moving pieces, but Reynolds ties together these threads satisfactorily, and places the events in the larger context of the REVELATION SPACE universe.Overall, I appreciate the details of Reynolds\u2019 universe more after having read five books set in it, and while I stand by my complaints about the excessive page count and glacial pace of the main three books in the trilogy (Revelation Space, Redemption Ark, Absolution Gap), I do see that he has taken care to build this world carefully and likely wants to hold back some revelations for future stories. He also has set some shorter stories in this universe which fill in gaps in the larger future-history narrative, including Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days and Galactic North.As always, John Lee narrates Reynolds\u2018 stories with gravitas, vaguely European-tinged accents, and a sense of drama and claustrophobic tension. I think some listeners will like his narration for that reason, while others may find it a bit tiresome. But you can\u2019t fault Reynolds and Lee teaming up for a consistent approach \u2014 nothing is worse than having the narrator change mid-series."}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily", "userReview": "A multi-faceted space opera detective story. It's detailed and pretty exciting, but a lot of characters are introduced in the first 20 pages or so, and it's a little hard to keep track of who's who when you don't know who are going to be the important ones (clue: they all are).The habitats of the Glitter Band (satellites around planet Yellowstone) are part of a libertarian demarchy (democratic anarchy), which means constant polls of everyone about everything. Paonoply is the organisation in charge of the polling cores in each habitat and general policing. Within that framework, each habitat can apply whatever system its citizens sign up for, including obscenely vile \"voluntary tyrannies\", hippy-esque idylls and others where everyone is in PVS or other forms of abstraction or virtual reality. The story opens after a habitat (and nearly 1000 inhabitants) has been blown up, apparently in a dispute over the purchase of an artwork. It turns out that far more powerful forces are at work. Tom Dreyfus is the Panoply prefect in charge of investigating the case. Meanwhile, one of his deputies, Thalia Ng, visits four other habitats to install trial polling software upgrades. Their stories diverge for much of the book, which gives it breadth, even though you know there will be plenty of overlap between the two.As befits the writing of a \"proper\" physicist, the future science is (mostly) plausible, but Reynolds doesn't fall into the trap of explaining too much at a time (which would be artificial and disrupt the story). In fact often things are mentioned and the reader is left wondering what on earth it is until there is the first hint of explanation several chapters later. It all adds to the suspense.I have only minor criticisms plot-wise. Very early on, one of the prefects seems to have another agenda. I would have preferred it if that plotline had come later, or been vaguer in the early stages. The other niggles concern the end of Thalia's time on the last habitat she visits and the qualifications (and disqualifications) for being Supreme Prefect - rather too far-fetched for my liking.Many different types of being/consciousness fill the pages, but whilst hints are dropped about racism against hyperpigs by baseline humans, the main themes of the book are much bigger: freedom, democracy and power; consciousness (of \"live\" beings, machines and hybrids thereof); the old quandary of whether the ends justify the means (whether a benevolent tyranny is better than anarchistic collapse, whether the police should be armed (you can tell he\u2019s a British writer!)); machines going rogue, and whether revenge and justice can ever be the same thing. Fortunately, he lets the reader decide on these issues; there are plenty of shades of grey. For example, there is a degree of understanding for those that could easily be labelled bad, one time explicitly saying such a character is not \"a bad man\" but \"a man who believes bad things\". If you prefer moral absolutes, or you\u2019re particularly fond of clocks and clockmakers, this is probably not the book for you!"}, {"userName": "Claudia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia", "userReview": "That\u2019s me now, at the end of The Prefect and Revelation Space series.

In my view he has been more successful when limiting the scope of any given novel to one aspect of his larger imagined universe, allowing him to concentrate his powers of description, generating a strong flavour of the culture the action develops in. The Prefect does just that.This particular novel is a detective story set in the Glitter Band - a place that will be familiar to Reynolds' fans. It is well written and gripping but relies at one point on a trick he's pulled once before - I hope not to see it again in the future.Reynolds' Century Rain also involved a detective and Peter F. Hamilton is also keen on mixing the detective story with the science fiction thriller - is a new sub-genre forming?28/1/2012Re-reading this I observe that there is an automaton in the shape of an owl that plays a minor role. Now Reynolds openly admits to taking inspiration from films and this particular owl appears to resemble a certain gift from the Goddess Athena in Ray Harryhausen's last film, Clash of the Titans. Hmmm. Release the Kraken!I also think I have done Reynolds a mild dishonour by suggesting that this is perhaps only an \"entertainment.\" In fact there is a very overt battle in the book between two characters, one of whom thinks people need to have their rights curtailed in the name of their own safety and another who is entirely opposed to this.

Which is interesting because early on in my reads of his books I found him to be too technical, taking hard scifi beyond what I could hope to understand. But as I read more of his works I have become to enjoy his work and to be honest, I think his work is just getting betterStory: 5/5\n1: Being Vague, rambling plot with no little believable storyline5: Ripping yarn, clever, thought provoking\nThe prefect is a stand alone story about the Glitter Band that was a part of the Revelation Space series. I was fascinated about the Glitter band and was very happy to be able to get into this story. The Glitter band is 10,000 habitats built onto rocks and asteroids hanging around Chasm City. Each habitat offers something unique in lifestyle from your regular humdrum life on the planet. You can have your head pulled off and spend your life immersed in the equivalent internet, you can replace half your body with a dolphin tail and have you legs serve you drinks, you can even go to planets where you begin a serf to a tyrant. What ever tickles your fancy. The main story is about the polling police. Each habitat has a vote and with 100,000 million people of 10,000 habitats they take their polling seriously. The Prefects uphold the law of the glitter band, but do not have any real powers on each habitat, so it is an interesting blend of power with out power unless the rules of the glitter band are at stake. It is kind of a hard hitting scifi whodunnit detective story with some nice political avenues, intrigue, power plays, dastardly bad guys with ultimately good motives and weird aliens. I loved the story line and thoroughly enjoyed the pace of it. Reynolds has certainly backed off the real hard stuff as he has developed this series. My only beef is, that this is a one off book, I think he could write a whole series on the Glitter band alone.Characters: 5/5\n1: Unrealistic/unbelievable. Feel nothing for these characters5: Fully engaged with the characters, believable. Researched.\nGreat character builds. There are probably 5 solid characters in this that you really start to get to know and feel for. I think the development of both Dreyfus and Ng was excellent as they both developed and changed as the story went on. The bad guy played a very nice role in that he fundamentally didn\u2019t think he was the bad guy and it was written in a believable way that had me for a while hoping he would see the error of his ways and join the forces of good once again. Once again Reynolds writes a great Pig character, for those of you who have read Revelation and enjoyed Scorpio will be happy to meet Sparver. Read Weight: Solid\nFluffy, Light, Solid, Heavy, Struggle\nNot as heavy as his earlier books, but still a solid scifi read.Engagement: 4/5\n1: Not fussed about finishing5: Could stay up all night\nI was engaged, I loved coming back to the story, but it was paced so that i never felt like I couldn\u2019t put it down. There are only a few crucial moments during the story that have you on the edge of your seat, the rest is a long build up to the ending. Recommend: 4/5\n1: Would advise you to read something else5: Go read it now. It is THAT good\nIf you are a scifi fan and love space world building then you\u2019ll probably enjoy this.

There are strong characters, a sturdy world (universe....multiverse?)and a good plot. The plot however started to fray badly about halfway through the book. I felt like he'd strewn his conspiracy laden plot out into a few too many strands and then let the strands sort of get out of control. The story lost focus and even began to wear a little thin out at the edges as he shifted from place to place, view to view, and character to character. BUT he got control back hammered it back into shape and the book came together nicely. I can safely say I liked it.This is the first Reynolds book that I've read and I read it out of order. It's the 5th in his Revelation Space set. It might have helped if I'd read the others first. It does end as if there will be more...oh well.

This sounded like my thing, a sort of harder than normal scifi with police procedural elements. The start was excellent with the build up and the world building as well as the crime or issue that arises. My issue though comes into the characterisation. I just felt like everyone was overly similar and I felt that Dreyfuss was that exciting. It felt like two books, with the 2nd half having pretty cliched dialogue and resolution or story arcs that just occured because it was needed to progress either the character or story.

The characterization was shoddy through the opening act -- the only female viewpoint character, Thalia Ng, was also the only character who seemed to feel any emotion at all, and as she was mainly nervous and afraid her emotions undercut my respect for her as a prefect -- especially as the other prefects whose viewpoints Reynolds showed all appeared calm, cool, collected, and totally in control. There were also moments where Reynolds forced the characters to have totally artificial-feeling conversations to provide important information to the reader -- not quite conversations of the \"Well, as you know, Bill, the Glitter Band is a string of 10,000 habitats circling the planet Yellowstone\" variety, but close.The imaginative scope of The Prefect fell shy for me in the beginning as well. All the best bits of imaginative work had been covered in previous novels set in this universe -- the Ultras and their ships are very minor characters, the Glitter Band and Chasm City are just there as backdrop, and no real prose is spent going over any of their wonders. The only new bits of imagination are expended on the four habitats that Thalia visits by herself, and they seemed surprisingly juvenile creations -- one consists of people who have given up most of their physical bodies in favor of a total life of the mind, so when they need to walk around they are merely heads in boxes; another is made up of people who have modeled their bodies after various animals and engage in violent jousting tournaments full of claws and teeth, fur and feathers. That imagery has been done before, and Reynolds himself seemed bored with it, as he switched away from Thalia's perspective after he set each of those habitats up and didn't return to her until she was done dealing with them.But as soon as Thalia arrived at House Aubusson, the novel started picking up speed. That habitat did show some of Reynolds' usual imagination, and its role in the complicated Demarchist voting system was fascinating to me. And shortly after that point, the final showdown began, and the book started racing towards its finish line. From that point I was glued to the page, feeling the tension rising and worrying my own brain at the problem of coming up with a solution to the threat bearing down on Panoply and the Glitter Band.Unfortunately, that point was only 180 pages into a 563 page novel. There is no way for any author to maintain a feverish intensity for the entire last two-thirds. The only way to pace a novel of that length is to have a mini-climax somewhere in the middle, a ramping down of the tension, and then a second, higher escalation for the true climax at the end. Reynolds had no mini-climax, no ramping down and then re-escalation, so though I raced through the middle section, by the time the story was starting to draw to a close I (and the narrative) was losing steam. The ending itself was a bit too much of a deus ex machina resolution for my taste (quite literally, actually), and the emotional story arc for Dreyfus simply never connected enough for me for that to be justification for reading the almost 600 pages.So ultimately, I would recommend this novel to anyone who's read the other Revelation Space novels because it does fill in some of the back story on the Glitter Band, but anyone who has never tried Reynolds before would be much better off starting with the original trilogy (Revelation Space, Redemption Ark, and Absolution Gap), which has much more impressive hard SF imaginings (I miss the Nostalgia for Infinity!) or with the other semi-standalone novel, Chasm City, which has a much better mystery."}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "I was wondering how the trilogy would hold up in comparison to a kind-of prequel, and was delighted to see a greater exploration of Aurora in the hey-day of humanity's triumph.

As a police procedural, it was a much better book, in my humble opinion, than Chasm City, although both had their definite charms. The stakes are always high in these books, as is the body count. I've now got my Reynolds sweet tooth and have got to have more.

His stories are deep, thoughtful, and have complex characters that inhabit his intricate fictional universe. His writing reminds me of Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, Robert Heinlein, and other masters of \u201chard\u201d fiction. As much as I like and enjoy lighter fare, this is what I consider the epitome of excellent writing. Take any well-crafted novel by a great author in this genre and it compares favorably with the best fiction of \u201cstraight fiction\u2019 authors.A few years ago I had read several of his novels (\u201cRevelation Space\u201d, \u201cChasm City\u201d, \u201cRedemption Ark\u201d, \u201cAbsolution Gap\u201d, \u201cCentury Rain\u201d, \u201cPushing Ice\u201d) and collections (\u201cDiamond Dogs/Turquoise Days\u201d, \u201cZima Blue\u2026\u201d). Most are based in the same fictional universe and timeline, but each are worthy independent works. After reading several of his books in a short time, I took a break from him (I do have to let the author \u201ccatch-up\u201d and create new material, after all). I timely feed on goodreads sent me looking for new material.\u201cThe Prefect\u201d is another excellent novel written in the same universe. Many of the major players in other stories are present, but they are in small, supporting roles. (Small in that they take up few pages: in once case they provide a critical service despite having such little ink.) As I mentioned above, each novel stands apart on its own plot and characters. They interrelate, of course, but you could read just one and still feel satisfied. I don\u2019t know why you would do that \u2013 finding great authors in any field is hard enough!As in most of my reviews, I tend to avoid spoilers except in the most minor sense. So, I can say that this novel has a protagonist who is complicated, performs a difficult and unwelcome job (Prefects are essentially a police force, but with a very limited mandate), and has unexpected qualities (versus the average Prefect) that generate loyalty and trust in several key characters. As in any novel of good length, the action and scope do not only involve this man. Other characters play important roles in expanding the story, generating tension and conflict, and driving the plot.It sounds so lame without details but take my word for it: the entire fate of the local human population is at risk in this tale. What starts with a horrific act develops into a doomsday scenario that threatens all. Only by the dogged detective work and convictions of Tom Dreyfus can the evil be identified, let alone combated against. You\u2019ll just have to read this one to hear more.I recommend his entire series of book. I know that some reviewers may have different rankings on each book, but taken as a series they are a major contribution to literature. Yes, I said literature: Science Fiction, Speculative Fiction, SF, - what ever you want to call it has been as pulpy as you can get, but it also has been written at levels that deserve to be called \u201cliterature\u201d. \u201cThe Prefect\u201d is one such novel. The mystery may not be the most complex, nor, the prose as elegant as other books I\u2019ve read and reviewed, but this is a very, very good book. I\u2019d give it a solid \u201c4.5\u201d any day."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/214053-adam", "userReview": "A delightful romp through politics and giddy inventions of the bizarre future society of the demarchists (democratic anarchism a post-scarcity system based on implants making constant polls) that reminds me of Sterling\u2019s Schismatrix and Swanwick\u2019s Vacuum Flowers.

Not once has he let me down, and The Prefect was a nice way to finish it up for me. ***MILD SPOILERS AHEAD***If you want to look at it chronologically, The Prefect is actually the earliest book in the series but the last book to be published in it (not counting the short stories Great Wall of Mars, Glacial and maybe 1 or 2 others), taking place in the 25th century, about a hundred years before the Melding Plague and the events of Revelation Space and Chasm City. In this story, the Glitter Band (a demarchist society of 10,000 habitats orbiting Yellowstone) still has not turned into the Rust Belt of the later books. What we get to see here is the belle epoque of humanity. I would not say it is in any way a utopia for all, but I believe that what we see here is the peak of humanity before it all goes downhill. This creates a sort of bitter sweet ending; I'm not spoiling anything here by saying all the loose ends get tied up nicely at the conclusion, but we know what's ultimately in store for the Glitter Band and the rest of humanity a century or so in the future. The Prefect immediately introduces us to a great mystery: who destroyed Ruskin-Sartorious space habitat, killing more than 900 innocent civilians, and more importantly, why?The instrument to investigate this crime is an enforcement agency of the Glitter Belt known as the Panoply. The book is titled after the agents of the Panoply (array of shields), known as Prefects (administrative monitors). One of the problems and one of the reasons this book is so fun, is that The Panoply has such a limited mandate to do this. You see, each orbiting colony is like a state with its own sovereignty. The Panoply is like a very toothless federal government, whose only mandate is to ensure that each colony's voting process is not obstructed. You get these really wonderful and imaginative colonies like the Shumper-Oneill in which citizens have voted to impose a voluntary tyranny on themselves because they feel liberated having the decision making part of their minds basically neutered by a self imposed autocratic government. There's also one where the citizens have voted to keep themselves in a vegetative state and immerse themselves in abstractions - a highly advanced form of the internet/virtual reality. The Panoply cannot interfere within these orbiting \"states\" as long as the majority rule is perpetuated. The Panoply is so toothless, that it even has to have the citizens vote in order to allow it to access heavier weapons! The Prefects however have the use of this great high tech versatile weapon known as the whiphound. Not gonna lie, its a pretty amazing device. It is a great, fast paced, action filled, and idea rich book I can't recommend enough. My only small complaint may be with the ultimate solution with The Clockmaker and Aurora. It left me a little underwhelmed, and if I could I'd actually rate this book 4.5 if I could just because of that. However, the journey was awesome, there's alot of stuff to think about such as how many people are you willing to sacrifice for the good of the majority, and alot of great concepts in the demarchic political system that will probably stay with you long after you've read it. It's a great first book to get into the Revalation Space Universe, but it can be read in any order. It did give me great pleasure though, to read about little things like The Sylveste Institute, the Lascaille Shroud, and Sandra Voi, that get fleshed out in later books."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1254714-steve", "userReview": "Yeah, I'm a fan. I continue to be impressed (blown away?) by Reynolds's epic imagination. In this stand alone installment of the Revelation Space universe, prefect Tom Dreyfuss investigates a massacre at one of the \"Glitter Band\" habitats. Without getting into the very deep Revelation Space weeds, the \"Glitter Band\" is a 10,000 habit strong confederation of humans in outer space. They are all different, ranging from fascist states to extremely liberal ones. There are a few principles they all must abide by. (For example, voting and the responsibility to vote are extremely important). I can't help but feel that Reynolds's has in mind some sort of idealistic outer space realization of the ancient Greek city states. There is an overriding concern for the value of life, and this is maintained by an overall authority called Panoply, who generally tries (\"do no harm\") to let the habitats be. Anyway, back to the massacre. Drefuss will soon discover that the atrocity is just the tip of an iceberg of a plot to overthrow the Glitter Band and Panoply. As in his other books, Reynolds spends the first half of the book layering things and setting a tone. The second half is a page turner, and a really good one at that. I like Reynolds' hopeful take on humanity --traitorous warts and all, but limning this hopefulness is an ongoing awareness of a Lovecraftian like horror out there in the cold universe. There are two monsters in this Revelation Space entry that make it quite easy to add this Sci-Fi novel to my Horror shelf. One in particular is even called \"evil incarnate.\" That will always get my attention.

I do kind of wonder how the author and Inspector Gadget would get along, since they seem to hold many of the same views, at least based on this story.I am also pleased that this book is set in a time before the melding plague, so that the glitter band is not just a rumor, and all the habitats et al are at their prime. I like the foreshadowing of the melding plague. Everything else I have read from this universe is set in the time after the melding plague (Chasm City) so it was really nice to get an idea of how things used to be and what it was like to be in the glitter band. Also, in general, this book was about 100 times better than Chasm City. I really liked the working relationship between Dreyfus and Sparver and Thalia and Jane Aumonier \u2013 I appreciated the range of characters \u2013 age, experience, background, personality, goals \u2013 it was obvious that these were all distinct people and this was well written. This sort of thing was very very refreshing especially after coming off The Passage, where almost every character was a teenager or a soldier and pretty much identical to every other teenager/soldier. I really liked the different storylines for each of them moving forward simultaneously. The internal conflicts at Panoply were a little overwrought, but not boring. The whole conflict in general was a little overwrought but also never boring - the pacing was a lot snappier than some of the author\u2019s other books. Because of the three intertwining storylines, there were a lot of cliffhanger moments, which was really great, especially in an audiobook, when these were strategically placed at the end of a CD.

Those books are (in the order I read them) Revelation Space, Redemption Ark, Chasm City, Absolution Gap and The Prefec.\n\n\nThe Revelation Space universe is at least as interesting as Peter F. Hamilton's Confederate and Commonwealth universes. The two British authors have similar ideas: humanity is flourishing hundreds of years in our future, we have met a few aliens and technology (especially in computing) has advanced in particular ways. Both universes feature a way for humans to \"cheat death.\" In Hamilton's, a memory cell which contains the entire personality can be backed up and then inserted into a cloned copy of the original person, and people can generally select their age, sex and overall physical appearance. In Reynolds' universe a back-up of the personality can be made and then installed in either an \"alpha-level\" or \"beta-level\"simulation which runs on a computer. Alpha-level simulations are controversial, they are considered independent entities in their own right; beta-level simulations are more common and are more likely to be replications of the original human personality they were based on.\n\n\nReynolds' stories are darker, more cerebral and intricately plotted with secrets within secrets to be revealed to the reader during the execution of the plot. Hamilton stories are usually more straight-up swashbuckling military space operas, thrilling adventures that greatly entertain. Hamilton is still my favorite writer, but Reynolds gives him a run for his money!\n\n\nA theme of Reynolds' work is the inclusion of complicated choices (often between multiple, equally bad scenarios) that his characters have to make and his obsession with identity and misdirection. Oftentimes a central question in the books is discovering the solution to a central mystery, and several times that mystery involves the \"true\" identity and motives of a central character.\n\n\n\nThe Prefect is set in a time period between the events of Revelation Space and Chasm City, set in the Glitter Band, a group of 10,000 human-made habitats set in orbit near the planet Yellowstone in the Sky's Edge star system. The title character is Tom Dreyfus, who is a member of Panoply, which is basically the police force for the 100 million people who live in the Glitter Band. Panoply officers are not allowed to carry guns, because their mission is to insure the process of democracy in the band, which occurs through nearly continuous electronic plebiscites of the populace. However, The Prefect at its core is really a standard detective novel, which I like because I am also a big fan of mysteries. It is reminiscent of Reynolds' best book to date, Chasm City, which also revolves around the work of a cop.\n\n\n\n\nIt is also a hard sci-fi novel. The book has profoundly altered humans known as Ultras, another group of altered humans known as Conjoiners, space battles, sentient computer programs and a possibly alien entity known as The Clockmaker.\n\n\n\n\nIf you like \"hard\" sci-fi and the work of authors like Hamilton, Reynolds and Neal Asher, you will almost definitely enjoy The Prefect.

The prefect is a space opera science fiction novel with focus on mystery and world building. This book is set in the Revelation Space Universe but other books are not required to be read before this book. The Prefect centers around Tom Dreyfus, who is a prefect for the Glitter Band, a large ring of space habitats that circle a planet. The Glitter Band is composed of individual space habitats that each are autonomous with their own weird sub-cultures but rely on the prefects at Panoply to protect them. Dreyfus is an investigator prefect, a kind of law enforcer, that is now investigating the destruction of a habitat that was purposely destroyed, killing over 900 people, just to hide something. Dreyfus must figure out why that habitat was destroyed and how it connects to events in the past. The strongest aspect of The Prefect by Alastair Reynolds is the world building. This is only the second novel by Reynolds I've read, along with some short stories, but I can always tell I am reading a Reynolds book based out of the Revelation Space Universe. There is an atmosphere that is difficult to explain without comparing it to other mediums but the Revelations Space Universe can be dark and brooding. It has slow space travel(can't go faster than light-speed), many bio-engineered and mechanically altered human beings have changed themselves to live in space flight and increase the longevity of their life. Because of these changes, the different \"races\" in this world are all from normal Earth humans, but they are so different now that they can't be considered baseline human. The Revelation Space Universe is set over 400 years into the future, with The Prefect being set in 2427. Technology has increased dramatically and when humans started to interface with machines, technology boomed. There are individuals that share thoughts with the collective hive think, there is the ability to transfer consciousness to a machine, and people have back up simulations of themselves. Reynolds tackles interesting ideas about what it is to be a person and integrates past events that have impacted the universe into his plot lines. I really like Reynold's writing but I do have to be in the mood for it. These are rather plot centered and world building centered books and when I'm in the mood for that, it works tremendously, but the characters can be too serious at times. Reynold's characters are so serious that sometimes the books can be a bit of a slog. There is little emotion other than the bleakness of the circumstances and because of that these are not lighthearted novels. You would never call this a fun book.The Prefect was a highly enjoyable plot centered story with a mystery element that worked well. Reading about Dreyfus figure out why that ship was destroyed and how it tied into past events, that are mentioned in all the Revelation Space books, was highly engrossing. I read these books because each book gives me a better understanding of this universe. No one book spells out this world in detail. Piecing together this universe by the clues given in these books is what I love. Because of this type of storytelling Reynolds throws the reader in pretty deep and asks them to just figure things out without much explanation. The Prefect is definitely a book that I like more after I've read it than while I'm reading it. There were times when I couldn't read much because I was getting a bit bored but the overall mystery kept me reading. I really liked The Prefect and highly encourage people that are into world building and piecing together things to check out Alastair Reynolds. 4/518/25 Possible ScorePlot - 4(Strong)Characters - 3(Good)World Building - 5(Exceptional)Writing Style - 4(Strong)Heart & Mind Aspect - 2(O.K.)"}], "description": "Tom Dreyfus is a Prefect, a policeman of sorts, and one of the best. His force is Panoply, and his beat is the multi-faceted utopian society of the Glitter Band, that vast swirl of space habitats orbiting the planet Yellowstone. These days, his job is his life.A murderous attack against a Glitter Band habitat is nasty, but it looks to be an open-and-shut case - until Dreyfus starts looking under some stones that some very powerful people would really rather stayed unturned. What he uncovers is far more serious than mere gruesome murder...", "title": "The Prefect\n      \n          (Prefect Dreyfus Emergency #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89195.The_Prefect", "average": 4.15, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327988786l/89195.jpg", "reviews": 479, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/51204.Alastair_Reynolds", "name": "Alastair Reynolds"}], "type": ["Science Fiction", "Space", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89195.The_Prefect", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9878665-the-prefect", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15852635-the-prefect", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8349247-the-prefect", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19047641-the-prefect", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2294766.The_Prefect", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3071545-the-prefect", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6458628-the-prefect", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89187.Revelation_Space", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89190.Redemption_Ark", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89185.Chasm_City", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1126719.House_of_Suns", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89184.Absolution_Gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9409759-powers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38213061-leviathan-wakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
