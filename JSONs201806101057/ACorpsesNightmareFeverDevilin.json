This is my first Fever Develin novelIt does stand alone as a good novel, even if you haven't read the previous booksThe book starts with Fever awakening in a hospital room - it seems he was the victim of a gunshot wound, near death (it seems that he died and his girlfriend brought him back to life - hence the name of the book), and has been in a coma that has lasted for three months. He is lost and confused, but determined to discover who shot him and why? Most importantly, why? With the reluctant assistance of his English pal Winston Andrews, Fever instigates his own almost death investigation, one made more difficult by his own parents' strange carnival-like lifestyle and his mother's penchant for hiding private treasures throughout the family home.Dreams and visions are his roadmaps into his own shooting and his own heritage, but he must sort among all the threads and images to discover what is real in terms of long buried memories of his parents and fantasy. The action, peppered with Fever's post-coma inclination to fall asleep at inopportune times, propels the many layers of a generational mystery, unpredictable, literary and sometimes far-fetched, but always entertaining. A blend of adventure, intellect and the spiritual realm, the novel is peopled with colorful folks and villains, family grudges and the sharp history of place, a unique plot, to say the leastThe story takes the reader to the opening days of jazz and back to modern times while Fever does what his mother instructed him not to do. His friends worry about his sanity, his safety, and his health. This is a excellent story peopled with the likes of Jelly-Roll Morton, who was the first to publish jazz sheet music, and others of the New Orleans-Chicago migration."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1245958-linda", "userReview": "The first 2/3 of the book was pretty slow. I almost quit reading. The last 1/3 it was hard to put down. He has written a series on this book and this is the 6th. I don't know if I will try another book for a while. A lot of this book you weren't sure what was really going on. The main character comes out of a coma after 3 months. He had been shot in his own home. The sheriff is a good friend of his and is frustrated because he hasn't found the shooter. The victim Fever Devilin is a folklorist and maybe that has something to do with how the story was written. Very strange with a lot of hallucinations by Fever."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17436756-michael", "userReview": "Very interesting, twisted plot.

It is a mystery, but it's also kind of sci-fi which adds another delicious element. While it say's it's a Fever Devlin mystery on the cover I did not realize it's the sixth book until I wanted to write this review. I've not read any other book in this series, but did not feel cheated as the story line speaks on it's own. The mysteries in the book has oddities interwoven through the story line like Ray Bradbury or Clive Barker with the sophistication of a Kurt Vonegut book. He uses actual quotes from Shakespeare and Poe to name a couple. Fever Devlin is shot and dies. He is brought back to life, only to remain in a coma for three months. When he comes out of the coma it is his desire to assist in his own investigation to discover who shot him and why. This is the simple underlying story, but it is by no means simple. Due to the length of the coma he awakes from Fever drifts in and out of sleep, sleeping long periods of time entering surreal type moments of the past. It is eluded to that this is part of his own heritage. The focus is on muddled events from New Orleans, France, Chicago and Georgia. A world of Jazz, genius, insanity, hatred and segregation. If you ever saw an episode of the outer limits, I think called Tempest, after a spider bite the individual goes back and forth from the airship to his own family and cannot tell which of the two are real. This has that type of feel. There's an elderly man from New Orleans ~ the Earl that continually appears to him unexpectedly and offers clues to putting his heritage together. Then Fever believes he can piece together his own childhood and the life of a mother he never understood. This information should enable him to understand who shot him and why. It's a wonderful book that allows your own imagination to freely flow. I only gave it 4 stars in that there were times I just kind of wished he'd get to the point, but I didn't dare jump ahead a few paragraphs to speed it up because those few lines that might seem unnecessary will be part of a clue he examines further on. I do give it a thumbs up and find it highly enjoyable reading."}, {"userName": "Amy Lignor", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6259268-amy-lignor", "userReview": "This newest release from the Fever Devilin series is, if possible, the best I\u2019ve read. For those unaware, Fever Devilin is a folklorist by trade who left the world of academia behind and moved back to his birthplace of Blue Mountain in the Appalachians of Georgia. Fever has always been beyond bright (with an IQ of 186) and there wasn\u2019t anything he didn\u2019t know since the age of nine.In this new novel, Fever begins in death, literally. Waking up in the hospital after three months, he's surprised and only has a vague recollection of being shot. An intruder walked into his home and shot him. No one has been able to find out anything about the intruder or why the crime was committed. All Fever seems to know for sure is that he had an \u201cangelic\u201d visitation that told him about a box hidden on his mantel that held a picture of a woman who looked a lot like his mother, an unsigned letter, and a mystery that existed back in Paris in 1923. Fever decides to figure this mystery out for himself by investigating the \u2018visions\u2019 he\u2019s receiving. It\u2019s difficult since his recovery includes blacking out without warning. And when Fever blacks out, he finds himself sitting in a Paris club called The Jazz Cat, watching a very frightening owner by the name of Lisa (who will take no guff off anybody, to say the least) and her true love, T-Bone. An intense mystery unfolds that spans time and includes everything from a desperate killer to The Great Migration, to who exactly Lisa and T-Bone really were and how they ended up a part of Fever\u2018s present-day life. The plot is intriguing and a great deal of fun to read. There are many adjectives that a reviewer can use depending on the mystery but, as always, Phillip Depoy stands out among suspense authors for the pure intelligence that he writes. His characters are witty and charming, and to be able to blend historical fact with present day, as well as continue to create new stories around a character that invites romance and danger is a true gift.Reviewed by Amy Lignor, author of \u201cTallent & Lowery - 13\u201d for Suspense Magazine"}, {"userName": "LJ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/250195-lj", "userReview": "First Sentence: The dead can dream; I\u2019ll tell you how I know.Fever Devlin has spent the last three months in a coma after someone entered his house, shot him and left him for dead. Now conscious, his dreams, a found box and hints from a stranger are leading him down a path to uncover a killer, and his past.Phillip DePoy\u2019s books may not be for everyone, but they are among those I eagerly await each year. His perspective is fascinating and intriguing; his characters are unique and memorable memorable; with Devlin\u2019s friend, Andrew, providing the pragmatic balance to Devlin\u2019s somewhat other-worldliness, and his voice audible; one you want to experience again and again. His wonderfully vivid descriptions take you into Devlin\u2019s world and into the past. I was reminded about historical events and the speed of technological developments. He is a wonderfully literate writer who writes excellent dialogue\u2026\u201dHe slept in the broken glass of rage.\u201d and with delightful humor. The plot is a road of blind turns, laced with that feeling of things being not quite \u201cnormal,\u201d with a slight paranormal aspect. Finally, in this sixth book of the series, learn of Fever\u2019s family history\u2014something about which we\u2019d learned snippets but nothing significant until now. And what a history it is, steeped in American Jazz, Paris, bigotry and hatred passed down from one generation to the next. At one point, it seems there is considerable redundancy, yet when one thinks of the circumstances, it is very normal and would be unusual not to be there. It also serves as pavers taking you along the road of the story. \u201cA Corpses\u2019s Nightmare\u201d is the story for which fans of DePoy have been waiting and not a bad place for readers new to the series to begin. It certainly did not disappoint.

I saw A Corpse's Nightmare on a shelf in my local library and borrowed it on a whim. An almost murder mystery with the dreams/nightmares of the recently comatose? Sure, why not?Now, I just finished this book approximately five minutes ago, so these are my first thoughts...If I could give half-stars, I'd probably give this three and a half. I enjoyed the story well enough, but felt that the first 60% dragged on for far too long. Perhaps it was the way DePoy's protagonist, Fever Develin, took a long time to put together what was going on. (Granted, as the reader, it's easier to be aware of motives and back-stories than the characters in the book. Still, it's sometimes nicer to be just as stumped as the characters you're reading about; it helps bring you into their world, in my opinion.) Thankfully, the pace picked up and I devoured the last 40% in short order.One thing I really did enjoy (and greatly helped move the story along for me) were the dynamics between Fever and some of the other characters. Lucinda was appropriately concerned and curt over her recovering but stubborn fianc\u00e9e. Dr. Andrews, a good friend of Fever's, felt almost perfect as his sidekick; their banter and exchanges were some of my favorites in the book.A Corpse's Nightmare is the sixth book in this series. While I believe the books go in chronological order and share characters and locations, I don't think they are necessarily sequels; it didn't feel like I missed too much by not reading the other books first and that this story stood on its own legs. However, I am now curious about the other books, so perhaps my views will change after reading them."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12049103-ann", "userReview": "The Fever Devilin series is one of my favorites. I love the author's descriptions and how he draws his characters. In this latest book, Fever is murdered. He is shot while he is asleep by an intruder who then makes a 911 call to brag that he had killed him. The quick actions of the rescue squad and Fever's fiance Lucinda bring him back from death but that leaves him in a deep coma for three months. During that time, he has vivid dreams of Paris and jazz during the 1920's. When he finally awakes, he finds that his house has been burglarized and a box of pictures and papers from his past have been stolen. This is a great series. Fever Devilin is such a great character. He is laid back and easy going and, with the addition of his friends, Winston Andrews, Sheriff Skidmore and a mysterious stranger, he tries to find answers to his murder, his past and his family."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1669197-susan", "userReview": "The Fever Devilin books are always strange, with unopened closets that might be haunted, and family secrets that can't be told, but this is even stranger than most. Fever comes around in the hospital after three months in a coma. He'd been shot, been declared dead, and brought back by medical science and the steely will of his fiancee, Lucinda. Now he's determined to find out who shot him and why, though handicapped by his tendency to fall asleep, confuse dreams with reality, and hallucinate. Between memories of words spoken by his mother, the ultimate in unreliable narrators, and dreams of the 1920's that haunted his coma, it's hard for him to tell just what's really been happening and what is only --well, a nightmare."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4298985-leslie", "userReview": "I liked this book better than the other Fever Devilin novel that I read, but it still has some problems. The plot was a lot of fun and there were some interesting and quirky characters. The story dragged a bit here and there and there was once again a lot of repetition and overuse of some favorite words and phrases. This writer could use a good editor. I think there may be a fatal error in the basic premise of the book, but it depends on the source for the dating of the events depicted in the scenes set in the early 20th century. I probably won't go out of my way to find more titles in this series, although if I do run across one I will probably read it for the folklore interest and just to see how the themes get worked in."}, {"userName": "April ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4034908-april", "userReview": "This is my first Fever Devlin novel, though DePoy's sixth. I like the rural Georgia background and the complexity of the characters (for instance, the bullying good old boy Devlin hates actually tries to save him. I also like the mysticism inherent in the two tales....Devlin's own current life and the life of his ancestor, (a jazz player in love with a Parisian bar owner) which he either visits in spirit in a coma or which his subconscious brings to the forefront, with the help of a mysterious figure (who's either FBI or magic).
