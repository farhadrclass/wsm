The first part up until the treaty of Br\u00e9tigny marks one of the lowest points in France's fortunes in the whole war, with the country unable to do anything about the destructive raids of the routier companies, holding towns and villages to ransome, encouraged yet not controlled by the English; the after effects of the Black Death; the battle of Poitiers, with the capture of the French king and many high ranking nobles; revolution in Paris and other northern cities; and effective civil war between different members of the Valois dynasty.The major cause of the French problems dates back all the way to the weakness of the late Carolingian kings. This led to power becoming diffused among the provincial nobility, causing cultural fragmentation and political disunity symbolised by the Angevin empire, where Henry II ruled more of France than the French kings. The major aim of the Capetian and then Valois monarchy over centuries was to centralise power into their own hands, but even in the fourteenth century this was far from being realised. Although France was much richer than England, collecting taxes was so difficult that much of this period saw the crown in financial crisis. Different communities tended to refuse to pay taxes, and even when they did often put unwelcome conditions on the money raised, such as reserving it for operations within their specific area (with the result that the most hard hit areas were unable to pay for defence and the others were unwilling). Rulers who had a high level of personal prestige were more easily able to persuade the different areas of France to grant them money, but continual defeat and perceptions that the money was used to enrich favourites reduced the reputations of the Valois monarchs almost to nothing.Militarily, the English had the advantage of better generalship (Dagworth, Lancaster, Chandos, Knolles and the Black Prince all outclassed the French regularly), but they lacked the resources to hold on to their gains. Once the French managed to reform their finances - bringing in the franc in 1360 and setting up a new tax system to end decades where the main source of the crown's income had been unpopular manipulation of the silver content of the currency - the end of this phase of the war became inevitable. They still had to make concessions, the English holdings in Gascony being extended and gains in the area around Calais being confirmed, but the treaty of Br\u00e9tigny and the accession of Charles V marked something of a new beginning.The story of these turbulent decades is ably told by Sumption, the details he gives (principally drawing on French archives) helping to make the whole course of events much clearer. The history is truly a great (if old fashioned) achievement, and it is to be hoped that Sumption manages to bring the whole thing to completion in as accomplished a manner."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6678151-mark", "userReview": "The second volume of Jonathan Sumption's monumental history of the Hundred Years War begins with the English basking in the glow of the twin victories of Cr\u00e9cy and the capture of Calais. It was only the beginning of a series of miseries for the French, though, with the military blows soon followed by the destabilizing effects of the Black Death and the demise of their king Philip VI. Though his successor, John II, subsequently had the appellation \"the Good\" attached to his name, Sumption leaves the reader wondering what he had done to deserve it, as his 14-year reign was characterized by a series of missteps. The ambitions of his son-in-law, Charles of Navarre, only added to the chaos of French politics, while the resumption of the war in 1355 saw an invasion of France the following year by the English king Edward III's son, the \"Black Prince.\" Confronting the English invaders at Poitiers, John led his forces to a defeat that ended in his capture.While a king's capture (or at least the inescapable prospect of it) may signal the end of a chess match, John's capture did not signify the end of the war. For while the French king negotiated with his captors in London, his kingdom gradually unraveled. With power dispersed among several individuals, there was no effective coordinated response to the bands of unemployed soldiers who roamed the country living off of plunder and extortion. In response, French peasants rose up in the rebellion known as the Jacquerie, while the demands for John's enormous ransom created a political crisis in Pars that ended in bloodshed. Though the English king Edward III enjoyed a commanding position, the terms he sought proved too objectionable to John's subjects, while a second treaty was never fully implemented because of Edward's unwillingness to make the necessary renunciation of his claims to the French throne. As Sumption demonstrates, this soon proved to be a serious error, as John's death in captivity in 1364 brought to the throne a new king who would prove a far more formidable opponent to English ambitions.All of this Sumption recounts in a detailed account that builds upon his previous volume, Trial by Battle, to convey the complexity of this epic conflict. His narrative ranges widely, from the maneuvering of monarchs to the efforts by towns to resist the locust-like hordes of mercenaries that periodically descended upon them. Buttressing his description is an analysis that offers nuanced judgments that help explain the reason why events took the course that they did. In all this is history at its finest, one that is must-reading for anyone seeking to understand this complex conflict which defined so much of the history of the Middle"}, {"userName": "gargamelscat", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3117699-gargamelscat", "userReview": "The first 200 pages are slow, though this is more the nature of the history - one small-scale destructive raid is pretty much indistinguisable from another - than the fault of the author.But once it reaches the battle of Poitiers and its aftermath its an absorbing read. The collapse of French rule, rebellion and sheer destruction of the bands of (literally) robber barons is stunning.My only concern is that with about 30 years covered per volume and taking 9 years to do each one, the author will have died before completing the series."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11498970-john", "userReview": "Justly acclaimed and excellent narrative history which details the conflict between the capture of Calais and the reopening of hostilities after a short peace treaty -in just under 600 pages.There's lots of juicy anecdotes and welcome personal profiles of some less high profile protagonists of the conflict and Sumption is at his strongest when describing these. He's also strong on using primary source material from provincial towns which brings alive the Black Death (in which soldiers remarkably survived for the most part as they were fitter and better fed than their civilian counterparts). He also uses these sources to describe how France shockingly jumped from crises and near-crises whilst England applied the pressure by invasion and alliances with Charles of Navarre and the civil war for the dukedom of Brittany.The narrative is disrupted somewhat by the detailed accounts of the Jacquerie and uprising in Paris against the Crown following the defeat at Poitiers at the hands of the Black Prince. The same is true for several chapters on the soldiers turned brigands rampaging France in companies - Sumption gets bogged down by so much geographic and personal detail it becomes wearying. He's clearly access primary sources and it shows.References are unhelpfully bunched together in footnotes but the maps are excellent and in my copy at least I only spotted 3 typos out of 600 plus pages.

It laid the foundations of France's national consciousness, even while destroying the prosperity and political preeminence which France had once enjoyed. It formed the nation's institutions, creating the germ of the absolute state of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In England, it brought intense effort and suffering, a powerful tide of patriotism, great fortune succeeded by bankruptcy, disintegration, and utter defeat. The war also brought turmoil and ruin to neighboring Scotland, Germany, Italy, and Spain.Trial by Fire, the second volume of Jonathan Sumption's monumental history of the Hundred Years War, takes up the story in 1347, the year the Truce of Calais was negotiated. When the French repudiated the truce in August 1349 it was to initiate a series of engagements with the English until Edward's last campaign in 1360. After this point the strength of the English companies in France declined, and their presence became a serious diplomatic embarrassment. At the same time, the fragmentation of French society became apparent as violent groups of Bretons, Bearnais, Navarrese, Germans, and above all Gascons roved the land. It was not until the marriage of Philip of Burgundy and Margaret of Flanders, in 1369, that the consolidation of France's territories was achieved.", "title": "Trial by Fire: The Hundred Years War, Volume 2\n      \n          (The Hundred Years War #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19456948-trial-by-fire", "average": 4.49, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387009248l/19456948.jpg", "reviews": 9, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/172973.Jonathan_Sumption", "name": "Jonathan Sumption"}], "type": ["History", "Nonfiction", "History", "Military", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19456948-trial-by-fire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/300041.Trial_by_Fire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14956851-trial-by-fire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2392908.Trial_by_Fire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1406751.Trial_by_Battle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1285191.The_Albigensian_Crusade", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2392905.Divided_Houses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25460373-cursed-kings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2172033.The_Age_of_Pilgrimage"]}
