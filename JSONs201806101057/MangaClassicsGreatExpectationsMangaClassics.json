This Manga Classic is superb!It made me want to read the original work.\n\nBasic Plot:\nPip is an orphan and he lives with his elder sister and brother-in-law, Joe. Pip's sister always complains about Pip. She finds bringing him up as a burden. Joe is a blacksmith and a super sweet guy.Mrs. Havisham is an old woman and is very peculiar. She was betrayed by the guy she was madly in love with and since then she lives in that moment of heartbreak. She is bitter and filled with anger and hatred. She has adopted a daughter - Estella who is breathtakingly beautiful but proud and rude.Mrs. Havisham is using Estella as her revenge from men. She wants men to fall in love with Estella so she can break their heart just like Mrs. Havisham's heart was broken. Poor Pip falls in love with the rich and beautiful Estella, not knowing how cruel is she. He has great expectations for his life. He wants to be rich like Estella so he can marry her. Honestly, there is more to this story than all the things I have mentioned above. This was just the basic plot and I don't want to give away spoilers. \nWhat I Loved in this Manga Classic:\n1. Obviously, the story. Although, the original story is written by Charles Dickens and I can't wait to read it. I do give credit to the manga creator for fluent and coherent adaptation. The story just flowed smoothly making me sway with its ups and downs.2. The characters. OMG! I love all of them. Pip for his innocence and helpful nature. He was ambitious but was soon lost in the world of riches. I loved how he bounced back with dignity.Joe for his cheerfulness in despite of hard times. His compassion for Pip and his sick wifeBiddy  for her compassion Poor Mrs. Havisham. She was rich but so poor by heart. I feel bad for what happened to her. Heartbreak can snatch your soul away leaving nothing but a gaping hole in your chest. You get stuck in that moment forever.Estella. The most pitiful character of the story. She didn't know what was love for she was raised without it. Pumblechook for I have an uncle just like him :-/3. The gorgeous artwork!\nWhat I Didn't Like: \nAbsolutely nothing! It was awesome and too good.

Young Pip looks well groomed, and Joe looks attractive and delicate\u2014quite unlike what I expected the poor blacksmith to look like. At the beginning of the manga, Magwitch looks worn and innocent, hugely contrasting the harsh and frightening appearance I had expected.The manga discounts the vernaculars that distinguish some of the characters. Joe and Magwitch, for example, appear unrefined through their eating habits, but their speech is relatively normal. I like how the visual element demands readers make inferences rather than receiving explicit and detailed descriptions\u2014but this also presents an adverse effect: characters often seem two-dimensional. Granted, a lot of the characters in the original are caricatures that merely help Pip grow and develop, but they do not lack depth to such a degree. Moreover, due to the lack of description, some characters seem superfluous, like Wemmick and Drummle. That said, I am aware that this could be ascribed to the abridged and visual format of the manga.On the whole, an enjoyable read, but lacking the mystery and excitement of the original."}, {"userName": "\u265b Garima \u265b", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25988362-garima", "userReview": "It is safe to say that I am not Charles Dickens fan.

I read Great Expectations some 9 years ago, so I admit I forgot a lot of details, and it's difficult now for me to properly decide if this adaptation is faithful enough or if it culled through a lot. However, I think that for someone who never read Dickens's original story, this manga version covers the essential parts: Pip's feelings towards his class as he grows up and moves up the ladder, his relationship with the beautiful but cold Estella, and the mystery about his benefactor. For those who have read Dickens, well... it's a good reason to read him again, I say.The artwork is similar to that of the other adaptations in this series: not by the same artist, but nonetheless quite pleasant to look at. Miss Havisham's dress is plain gorgeous, and her dusty, spiderweb-covered room definitely creepy. Estella's posture and attitude reflect the way she was brought up. Joe isn't like the character in the novel, physically, yet no matter what his design still conveyed that he's a good man. Actually, it's easy to detect who is \"nice\" and who is \"evil\" from their features\u2014and while it may be considered a graphic shortcut, it also quickly allows the reader to picture who does (or will do) what, something that would be more difficult to achieve here anyway than in the original prose form.The pace was rushed in places, though, especially when it comes to how Pip's take on life, people and events changed: it was wrapped up a little bit too fast, and as a result, Pip mostly came off as bratty most of the time (which he is, alright). And as the format demanded the story be restricted to 300 pages, some of its depth was lost along the way; the novel left room for more development, whereas in the manga, most characters felts rather one-dimensional.Still, I would recommend it if only for the artwork and for its ability to make one want to (re)read Great Expectations itself. 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4605519-jamie", "userReview": "3.5 Art was good, but story drags a times, especially the last third."}, {"userName": "Sarah Marie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6515737-sarah-marie", "userReview": "Manga Classics: Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, Stacy King, & Nokman Poon3.25 starsThe tale of Great Expectations is a famous one, but most people only hear it and passing and don\u2019t realize that it is a Dickens novel. It follows the story of Pip, a young man living in poverty and destined to follow his sister\u2019s husband\u2019s footsteps as a blacksmith. He stumbles upon a convict and is scared that this will lead to his arrest and shame. He stumbles into the great rooms of Miss Havisham\u2019s mansion and the lovely Estella. Miss Havisham has been secluded into her house for more than twenty years and still wears the wedding dress she was abandoned in. Estella is her revenge against men for the wrong she faced. Pip loves Estella with all his heart, but is a poor boy. That is, until Pip comes into his Great Expectations and an anonymous donor funds his ability to rise into London\u2019s high society as a young man. It\u2019s a simple story and it is wonderfully adapted in this edition. I liked this adaptation so much that I picked up the audiobook of it and bought myself a personal copy. Since then, I have read Great Expectations and I think that is what is so wonderful about this series. It introduced me to a story that I knew was famous, but didn\u2019t necessarily want to read. However, this story is vast and it struggles as a manga. There was a lot cut and this is a very abridged version of the story. This is particularly due to Dickens\u2019 writing style. It is simple, but it doesn\u2019t feel complete without seeing the words on the page. The art is quite nice, but it isn\u2019t the strongest of the manga classics and for that reason it didn\u2019t hold a special place in my heart.Art Scale: 2.5My biggest problem with Great Expectations is Pip. He is a rather boring character in this adaptation and notions are silly and quite frivolous. However, after reading the source material, I think this intentional as the story is told by a much older Pip who is reflecting on this time in his life as a silly young boy and man.Estella is a real piece of work. She isn\u2019t redeemable by any means, but she was nurtured to be cruel, unforgiving, and cold. It makes an interesting nature versus nurture debate. The majority of Great Expectations characters are detestable. That\u2019s what makes them so memorable! Ah, Mrs. Havisham is one of my favorites in classical literature.Character Scale: 4Overall, this adaptation made me interested in picking up the original work and I think that it did its purpose. It was also nice to finally be introduced to Dickens outside of A Christmas Carol. I would recommend this if you are unsure about whether you would like Dickens or if classics intimidate you, but you want to know what people in literary discussions are referencing. You could be pretentious without a lot of effort (or just pick up the actual novel because I preferred it more).Plotastic Scale: 3.75Cover Thoughts: It\u2019s interesting, but not a favorite.Thank you, Netgalley and Udon Entertainment for providing me with a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Joanna (joreadsalot)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17348951-joanna-joreadsalot", "userReview": "*** Disclaimer: Received this from the author/publisher via Netgalley for an honest review***I had read Great Expectations early on in my life. It was a mass market paperback that had a page count of well over 500 pages, if I remember clearly, which made it a beast of a book. I really hated that book then and never thought I would pick up the story once more. I was glad to find the manga for review on Netgalley because it allowed me to explore the story of Pip and Estella again as an older reader but in a timely fashion.Let me start with the fact that the art is lovely. It is very dynamic and each frame was artfully placed. The progression of the plot is where I found it to be a bit choppy. I think that a lot of the beginning was spent with Pip as a child and because of that the ending had to get crunched in the last third to try and get in his adult years. I also felt that the relationship Havisham had with both Pip and Estella could have been flushed out more. I couldn't feel their reasoning for entertaining her throughout all the years. It is a very subtle thing explored in the actual book over a lot of pages so I kind of understand why it couldn't be done in the smaller page count here however I feel because it wasn't done I wasn't sold on their inherent connection to her. Without this connection you couldn't feel empathy for Havisham even in a small capacity.The ending was very open ended and I really appreciated that. The author's notes at the end of the manga explained why they decided to go that route and I agree with them about it because the ending of the book I read (as the original Great Expectations had two endings written by Dickens) just irritated me greatly.In the end I think this was still a terrific way to present this story and introduce people to Dickens' usually very large and long winded classics. I am excited to read more from the Manga Classic series as it allows me to read a lot of classics in a more engaging format.Happy Reading Jo"}, {"userName": "Flor", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25234284-flor", "userReview": "Wow!

A really good read, and I'm not talking about the plot because it was better for me that way. However what I am going to talk about it's the magnificent way in which they made it to manga.The art is beautiful and meaningful. All the emotions that I was supposed to feel were felt, and I was amazed with how well detailed every page was.As I have not read the original work I cannot say if it was well adapted, but in my opinion it was. I understood the whole story and felt it complete, so I'm guessing that at least all the important details were there.Again, I'm so grateful that these books exist, a wonderful way to reread or read (if you're overwhelmed by the original) the classics."}, {"userName": "Mallory (toweroftomes)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34258395-mallory-toweroftomes", "userReview": "Find\u00a0this review and more fantastical things at The Leaning Tower of Tomes.The mini-review:Manga Classics adapt the classics we all know and love in the manga comic format and art style. I\u2019ve read and loved the manga adaptations of Les Miserables and Pride and Prejudice, so I was thrilled that my library had Great Expectations! These are hefty books, around 300 pages, but they fly by so quickly! This one happens to be an adaptation of Charles Dickens\u2019 Great Expectations, and, while it obviously had to cut a huge amount of the original story, it does a very good job of remaining (relatively? I\u2019ll get to that in a moment) faithful to the original story.Back to the \u201crelatively\u201d from the previous paragraph: I haven\u2019t actually, uh, read Great Expectations, so I\u2019m perhaps not the best judge of how much was cut for this manga. But I have watched the 2011 BBC miniseries, which I liked for the most part (Douglas Booth\u2019s cheekbones and jawline are unreal), and which garnered generally positive reviews. From what I remember of the miniseries, the manga mirrors it well. But\u2026 I guess I should go and read the real Great Expectations? Because I totally missed out on that in high school. (I have read A Christmas Carol, however, so you can\u2019t say I\u2019ve never read Dickens.)I think the main gripe I have with Great Expectations, in any format, is how unlikable Estella is, and how arrogant and different Pip becomes. I like the mystery behind Miss Havisham, Magwitch, and Compeyson, as they are far more interesting characters, despite being strange and quite hard to decipher.But besides the fault of Dickens, and not this manga, which I am reviewing today, this is a great visual adaptation to ease readers into Great Expectations or give those who have already read the book a new way to look at the story. The illustrations are simply gorgeous, and the dialogue, for the most part, is pretty straightforward. (There was one instance, though, where Pip called Orlick a \u201cpunk\u201d and I had to laugh. Did \u201cpunk\u201d even exist in the early to mid-1800s?) Anyway, I highly recommend the Manga Classics series. They\u2019re also a terrific way to get into manga in general, as they tell familiar stories most of us are familiar with. \u2666So tell me...Have you read Manga Classics: Great Expectations?

This, of course, meant English 1101. I remember being assigned several readings, \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d being among them. Now you must understand that \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d is not a slim volume, it clocks in at 500+ pages of fairly dense, classical writing that requires deft attention if you want to keep up with the story. As I recall, I ditched the text itself and went straight for the Cliff\u2019s Notes summary, which netted me a perfectly reasonable \u201cC+\u201d on my paper. That was way good enough for me, as I had much better things to do in my freshman year. I was batting leadoff for my intramural softball team, and there was beer to be downed after games, so you KNOW where my priorities were. Definition of bildungsroman: a novel or story dealing with one\u2019s personal formative years and/or spiritual education and experience. \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d is quite possibly THE definitive bildungsroman. It is truly one of the classic pieces of literature, and it\u2019s characters and plot tropes have entered and influenced so much of Western culture that it almost seems counterintuitive to try and document how important the book is to literature as a whole. And if you think that I\u2019m going to try and review the work itself, you are quite incorrect. For one, I STILL haven\u2019t read the book itself, as I\u2019m perfectly happy with that \u201cC+\u201d that I got in freshman English. Even my desire to catch up on classics that I have missed over the years can\u2019t overcome my hesitation to pick up the tome. Besides, I know all the basics\u2026...main character Pip recounts his story of growth and redemption as he navigates the prides and pitfalls of English society through the course of his life. There is action, drama, humor, pathos\u2026.this book literally has it all. And of course the side characters have made their mark as well\u2026.the eccentric Miss Havisham, the cold and ruthless Estella, the kind but lowly blacksmith Joe, the evil Compeyson\u2026.all of these enduring characters have entered into the literary canon and been examined and written about and psychoanalyzed to death. No, there is no point whatsoever in trying to review a work like \u201cGreat Expectations.\u201d You either know it and accept it for what it is, or you don\u2019t. That said, I couldn\u2019t resist picking up a copy of \u201cManga Classics: Great Expectations\u201d one day when I was at the used book store. It was on sale, I had a coupon, and I figured that I could at the very least expand my Cliff\u2019s Notes knowledge of the source material. It seemed to be a perfectly good way to engage with this massive classic without having to wade into the water itself, so to speak. And by gosh, I think I made a pretty good decision. The story adaptation by Crystal S. Chan is solid and covers the main parts of the story well, and the art by Nokman Poon is lively and totally in keeping with established manga styles and conventions. The text was adapted into English by Stacy King. It\u2019s difficult to conceive of how a book as massive and sweeping as \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d could be condensed into 295 pages of dialog boxes and artwork, but here it is. I think Chan and Poon should both be congratulated for doing such a good job of keeping the bones of the story intact while maintaining a narrative thrust. The manga begins at the same place as the book does, with the iconic graveyard confrontation between the young, orphaned Pip and the escaped convict Magwitch. From there it careens through the tale at a breakneck pace. Pip\u2019s introduction to a world beyond the commoner lifestyle when he first meets Miss Havisham and her adopted daughter, Estella. Pip\u2019s change of fortune that allows him to escape poverty and study in London to become a proper gentleman. The eventual outing of Magwitch as Pip\u2019s benefactor and the consequences of that fateful action. The constant theme of the growth of Pip as a human being with a conscience and an unwavering sense of honor. It\u2019s all there, though in abbreviated form. There is no way that all of the bases could have been covered in an adaptation this short, but the STORY is there, complete and full-bodied enough to satisfy anyone interested. I can see where this volume would encourage a reader to pick up the source material and dive in, but I can also see where this would be enough to carry the general reader through this enduring work of literary art. There is also a valuable section at the end of the book that goes into some background detail of how \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d made it to the manga format, and these extra features add some depth and explanation to the exercise as a whole. What to leave in? What to leave out? What to leave to the reader\u2019s imagination? All this and more is brought to the table as Chan and Poon take the time to talk about their adaptation. Most readers will be aware that Charles Dickens wrote two endings for \u201cGreat Expectations.\u201d The ending in this manga is smartly left open-ended, allowing the audience to imagine whichever ending they wish with no repercussions. All in all, I was very happy with this manga adaptation. I wish that something like this had been available back in 1985 when I was working on that paper. This beats Cliff\u2019s Notes all to hell and back. I\u2019m not sure whether or not I will personally feel compelled to pick up the book itself. This is probably as complete an understanding of \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d as I will ever really need. There are other classics in this particular series, \u201cEmma,\u201d \u201cThe Scarlet Letter,\u201d \u201cLes Miserables.\u201d I can see a lot of value in collecting more of these adaptations, especially for those who would like a basic understanding of just what makes a classic book a classic in the first place."}, {"userName": "Giselle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17342385-giselle", "userReview": "* I received an eARC of this manga from the publisher (UDON Entertainment) via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.UDON Entertainment takes us again to a new literary landscape through the publication of one of Charles Dickens\u2019s finest novel in a Manga format titled, The Great Expectation. I have yet to read any of Charles Dickens\u2019s great literary works so I don\u2019t have any idea about his original work so this review will not be compared against the original version. Apart from the two Manga Classics I\u2019ve read (Austen\u2019s Emma and Hawthorne\u2019s The Scarlet Letter), the adaptation of The Great Expectation by Charles Dickens was probably my favorite. I particularly liked the portrayal of characters in this manga edition, everything were so on point: the emotions, the artwork, the story line and the setting coupled by the artist\u2019s and writer\u2019s unique interpretation.The Great Expectation is the thirteenth novel scrupulously written by Charles Dickens and is set in the mid-1800s. Compared to Jane Austen\u2019s Emma, this one is a bit dark and delivers a poignant look on love and loyalty. The story is centered around themes like revenge, betrayal, forgiveness, secrecy, family relationships, one-sided love, indifference and selfishness.When the dialogue says Estella is a beautiful girl, the graphic artists literally mean it. I couldn\u2019t picture her in any other way but this:I didn\u2019t know that art could be this powerful. By looking at Miss Havisham, it gives me a creepy feeling I couldn\u2019t understand. I was seemingly moved by how beautiful and very intriguing Charles Dickens\u2019 story was.THE GREAT & FAVORITE PART\n\nMISS HAVISHAM: \u201cI want your love.\u201dESTELLA: \u201cI am what you have made me. What would you have from me?\u201d\u201cI am beginning to understand. If you raised you adopted daughter in the dark confines of this room, and hid from her the existence of sunlight; and then expected her to know all about the sun, would you be not disappointed? I must be taken as I have been made.\u201d\n\nTHE INTERPRETATIONI perceived these lines like this: \n\u201cWho give you the right to ask for something you didn\u2019t even give to me? You are asking me for love when you yourself, didn\u2019t show me what love truly is. You are asking me of something I was denied for. Take me as I am. As you wanted me to be.\u201d \nSimple response yet so powerful.THE VAGUE ENDING\n\n\u201cAnd will continue friends apart.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve learned that there were two endings in the original book of Great Expectations. In the Manga Classics version they chose to have an open ending; an evil cliffhanger that will depend on reader\u2019s imagination. I was greatly satisfied with the Manga\u2019s indistinct ending. Whatever the ending would be, I was contented with the clear message behind the conflict resolution regardless of the absence or presence of happily ever after. The creators decided to have an open ending because according to them and I quote, \u201cWe wanted to make the point that the romantic relationship between Pip and Estella (or lack thereof) is not the most important part of the story.\u201d In the manga edition, the writers and artists weaved and presented Pip and Magwitch relationship pivotal to the story.The entire story was not only focused on the unrequited love of Pip and Estella\u2019s indifference but it also teaches us about the ugly side of BETRAYAL & REVENGE; the beauty of FORGIVENESS; the value of ACCEPTANCE; the importance of FRIENDSHIP and how great SELFLESS LOVE can be.I love the graphics, the writing style and the entire book in general. I think I enjoyed this one more than the Manga Classic Emma. The artwork was just so beautiful. The authors and the artists handled Dicken\u2019s novel remarkably well. I loved how they covered almost all of the essential parts.Here\u2019s the thing, if you wanted to learn or to know something about one of the greatest literary piece of all time but you don\u2019t have so much time, read this manga. In less than an hour, you will have a glimpse about the original work filled with artistic visual graphics.I would highly recommend this manga to anyone. The artists and the authors behind this manga made the literary classic novel accessible to everyone.*Thank you UDON Entertainment for sending me an advanced copy of another Manga Classics! :DReview also posted here: HARDWORK BOULEVARD"}, {"userName": "Adela Cacovean ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5885710-adela-cacovean", "userReview": "http://vanillamoonbooks.blogspot.ro/2...Having read all previous titles in the Manga Classics collection, I've decided to dive yet again into a new classic brought to life in manga form. It seems to have become a tradition now to end up wanting to read the original work after falling in love with the graphic novel, as it was the case with Great Expectations, this time beautifully illustrated by Nokman Poon.Unfamiliar with the plot of Great Expectations, I found it to be a very interesting story that I would love to learn more about. According to the note at the end, the manga adaptation doesn't stray from the original work of Charles Dickens, but only leaves secondary plots aside so as to fit perfectly in the format of around 300 pages Manga Classics has used us with.The story follows Pip, a young boy who helps a prisoner with some food, an act which ends up changing his life in ways he would have never imagined. Pip, who lives with his sister and her husband, after visiting Miss Havisham and her adopted daughter several times, dreams of a better life for himself, one as an educated gentleman which is later granted to him by a mysterious benefactor whom he believes is Miss Havisham herself. As he gets accustomed to his new life, he completely changes himself, no longer feeling comfortable around his old friends and acquaintances who remind him of his old lifestyle.As for the artwork, while the artist is a different one from the other Manga Classics titles, his style is very pleasant to the eye, and the characters are drawn uniquely enough so the reader won't get confused and follow the story easily.Like always, I recommend all Manga Classics titles, either as an alternative to a chunky book, or as a way to remember a classic you already read and loved. People reading a manga adaptation of a classic they haven't tried before might be surprised to realize they will end up picking the original work soon after reading the manga.

In this particular manga adaptation, the art is so beautiful that really pains me to say: overall, this was poorly executed.Despite the lovely art, the story and dialogue are terrible to follow. The dialogue is choppy and all over the place - there is nothing even close to a natural flow of conversation. There are too many details in the original story to be squashed into this manga. The scenes - and years - rush by and I feel as though half of the characters and plot should have been left out. Adapting a novel does not mean you must include every single detail. Some things don't even work without prose. Again, Manga Classics offers a wide range of different designs that were all nicely done. Though for the most of it, the personalities struck me as flat. I saw zero chemistry between Pip and Estella - I can't see why either liked the other. In fact, I found most characters rather unlikeable. Even Pip himself comes across as nothing but a self-absorbed brat who doesn't know how to appreciate others. Definitely not the strongest in the series!"}, {"userName": "Marjolein", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5289598-marjolein", "userReview": "3.5 stars Read all my reviews on http://urlphantomhive.booklikes.com I've been reading quite a lot of Manga Classics lately, but unfortunately this is for now the last in the series. Let me start by saying I hope there will be more soon because I liked this one and also the other I've read (Les Miserables, The Scarlet Letter, Emma and Pride & Prejudice).The story is so well know that I don't think I need to discuss it. Instead, I'd like to say that although I haven't read the book I kind of knew the story from a BBC adaptation I watched a few years ago and I think it followed the story quite well (for as far as I can remember). It's only obvious that some details get lost when the story gets adapted into a 300 page manga. I don't think this is necessarily a problem, since it's a great introduction or refresher in my opinion. It's not a substitute for reading the classics but an addition I like to read. This manga (as well as the others) have made me want to read the originals that I hadn't read already. I don't think I'll be the only one who feels this way. Hope there's another one soon and can't wait to find out which classic is next!Thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for providing me with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review!"}, {"userName": "Sesana", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana", "userReview": "I haven't actually read Great Expectations, so maybe not the most informed review? That said, I've picked up a fair bit by cultural osmosis, so I didn't go in totally ignorant. More so than the other Manga Classics I've read so far, this one actually felt abridged. That didn't bother me, because I didn't know what I was missing, but I could tell. Again, standard manga style in the art.

I love manga. I love manga so much that I literally bought my kindle just to afford all the volumes that a single manga series has to offer. This manga is extremely interesting especially detailed with the draws, yet nothing can ever compare to reading the book. That being said, I would not advice you to reading this manga thinking you can pass a literary test about it. However, I think for anyone who hasn\u2019t read The Great Expectation but would like to be introduced to the book, this is a great opportunity. The manga version covers all the essential parts such as:Pip\u2019s feeling towards the working class has he grows up and attempts to move up the ladderPip\u2019s relationship towards this beautiful yet cold EstellaPip\u2019s mysterious benefactor\u2026Even thought the manga does cover the main parts of the novel, it\u2019s still not a good idea to take a test on The Great Expectation after reading this classic manga.The artwork is amazing. The manga adaptation in this series truly makes the entire experience of re-reading this novel amazing. The set of artist that took their time making sure the classic manga adaptation of the novel towards a Japanese comic book style is more than stunning. The way Miss Havisham\u2019s dress is flat out gorgeous, her creepy dusty covered spider webs that makes the entire page look more than haunting. Then there\u2019s the cold shoulder Estella illustrated posture makes the transition between \u201cnice\u201d and down right \u201cevil\u201d which is the exact same way I felt about her when I read The Great Expectation so many years ago.\tOverall, I felt that this book is amazing. The adaptation of the classic novel The Great Expectation by Charles Dickens is a great book to add to ones literary collection or for those who are extremely in love with Undon Entertainments collection of artist, adaptations, art style, and of course manga.This review was originally posted on Lia's Bookish Obsession"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33388814-elizabeth", "userReview": "If you have read Great Expectations by Charles Dickens then you know what this book is about.

If you haven\u2019t read this well loved classic because you either tried and couldn\u2019t get into it or this doesn\u2019t seem like your type of read, then I recommend giving the Manga version a try.

It\u2019s been many years since I\u2019ve read Great Expectations, but I remember enjoying the overall character arc, and so I was excited to read an adaptation. I can\u2019t imagine the amount of time, effort, and close readings it took to create such an abridged yet cohesive telling of this novel. My reasons for awarding four stars instead of five may be attributed to faults in the original story itself rather than the manga\u2019s execution. Great Expectations is a particularly difficult book to adapt into a short-form medium due to the large cast of characters and the passage of time. The pacing in manga format felt a bit rushed\u2014more like a short story or a fable. The years pass quickly rather than organically; the length of the original text simulates time passing in a way that is difficult to achieve with short illustrated scenes. In addition, the original story could be quite confusing, so it is not surprising that the adaptation was similarly difficult to follow at times. Like in The Scarlet Letter adaptation, the art style is easy on the eyes and the characters are differentiated in interesting ways. I greatly admire the work that went into the action scenes in particular. One of my favorite parts was Estella\u2019s argument with Miss Havisham about her upbringing: \u201cIf you raised your adopted daughter in the dark confines of this room, and hid from her the existence of sunlight\u2026and then expected her to know all about the sun, would you not be disappointed?\u201dAs in the other Manga Classics, there is a great authors\u2019 note section explaining the logistics of the adaptation process in addition to a literary analysis of the original tale. This series is a great supplement to reading classic literature, although perhaps they are better appreciated after one has read the original work. I hope to devour the Manga Classics version of Emma next!"}, {"userName": "Jules \u2648 \u263eBookvergent\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44480390-jules-bookvergent", "userReview": "[ Estella grew up to be this cold hearted person because of her \"mother\" and knew she was that way so she pushed Pip away for his own sanity.

Pip works as a blacksmith apprentice but has \u201cgreat expectations\u201d of one day becoming a gentleman. The string of characters who play a great role in his life are very interesting. They include: kind and good-hearted Joe, an escaped convict Magwitch, the old and bitter Miss Havisham who was jilted at the alter on her wedding and the beautiful but haughty Estella.Pros: I\u2019m not a fan of old classics. The writing style and old English literature just puts me to sleep. But that\u2019s simply sad, as I don\u2019t want to miss out on the good stories hidden in those pages. So for a person like me, this graphic novel version of reading classics is just totally fab! ;) I always did love the story of Great Expectations, however seeing it come alive with pictures was such a lovely way of understanding and visualizing this story. The original book is a whopping 505 page of complex literature! Compare that to a 308-page of simplified beauty! Manga was a great way of capturing the entire story in this abridged, illustrated version. Enjoyed the essence of the story far more this way.Cons: My copy was a review copy so I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the reason, the pictures are in black-and-white. I wish they were in vivid colors. There\u2019s a strange way to read a Manga. For those who don\u2019t know, Manga are comics/cartoons created in Japan and they have their own style. You need to read them from Right to Left, so that gets a little getting-used-to. And lastly, I STILL found the story a tad bit too long and complex around the end!

I absolutely love the art, it is very precise and easy to follow without all the extra frills that sometimes get added. The story itself I have never read, but the other two I have read both this and the story of are pretty close, so I am going to assume this is the same. The adaptor did explain that she changed the ending, but that Dickens himself had written two endings, so she tried to compromise between them. This is a good series for either reluctant readers or for someone who wants to get an idea of what the classic is all about.
