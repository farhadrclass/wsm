Giving a book like the Grapes of Wrath to a 15 year old serves largely to put them off fine literature for the rest of their lives. The depth of understanding and compassion for the human condition as communicated by a book like this is simply unfathomable to those who haven't lived much life yet, but after you've gotten a healthy dose of living, it comes across like fine music to a trained ear. My heart doesn't bleed for the Joads today as it might have 25 years ago. Yes, it's grim and unfair, but it's no longer shocking or disturbing, and I can see now that Steinbeck didn't intend sensationalism to be the main point. What he's about is revealing the human dignity, the innate goodness and unbreakable pride of these people, and by extension the American people in general, something that still resonates today, especially with reference to the working classes. When the Joads and their kind decline government hand outs, requesting instead the simple opportunity to work hard and be rewarded commensurate with their labor (even if it means a grueling cross-country journey to a place they don't know) one can hear today's white working poors' exasperated disdain for government, insisting that they simply be allowed to keep more of their pay and not be held back in their efforts by nit-picking legalities and cultural trivialities that disapprove of their lifestyles. Sadly, most such people will never read the Grapes of Wrath. Worse yet, many liberal lawmakers won't read it again after high school and won't glean from it an essential understanding about the pride and perseverance of the American working class which the far right is playing like a fiddle much to the detriment of the entire nation. A book like the Grapes of Wrath should be required reading - for every American over 30."}, {"userName": "Stephanie *Very Stable Genius*", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1085121-stephanie-very-stable-genius", "userReview": "If you are an American you need to read The Grapes of Wrath. It scares the poop out of me because, my fellow Americans, we are repeating history. If live anywhere else read it as well as a guide for what not to do.In the Grapes of Wrath Mr. Steinbeck tells the tale of the first great depression through the Joad family from Oklahoma, who has been displaced from their family farm through no fault of their own. You see, there was a big bad drought which made farming impossible. In those days the family farm fed the family and what they had left over they sold. But when the drought hit the only thing that would grow was cotton, you can\u2019t eat cotton, and that crop sucked the life right out of the soil so no other crop could grow in it for a very long time.\u201cThese things were lost, and crops were reckoned in dollars, and land was valued by principal plus interest, and crops were bought and sold before they were planted. Then crop failure, drought, and flood were no longer little deaths within life, but simple losses of money. And all their love was thinned with money, and all their fierceness dribbled away in interest until they were no longer farmers at all, but little shopkeepers of crops, little manufacturers who must sell before they can make. Then those farmers who were not good shopkeepers lost their land to good shopkeepers. No matter how clever, how loving a man might be with earth and growing things, he could not survive if he were not also a good shopkeeper. And as time went on, the business men had the farms, and the farms grew larger, but there were fewer of them.\u201dSome guys with a lot of cash came along and bought up all the struggling family farms and leased the land back to the former family farmers and when they couldn\u2019t produce, the new Owners kicked the families out of their homes. Put them on the streets, children and elderly and all\u2026\u2026..who cares, right? Poor people are less than.From California came hand bills, pamphlets promising jobs and urging the homeless to drag their whole lives via barely moving junk heaps to the golden state where grapes grew in bunches by the side of the road. What choice did they have? They drove across deserts and mountains, losing loved ones along the way, they answered those hand bills in droves. What else could they do?What happened when they got to California? They didn\u2019t get jobs, they got ridicule. They were called Okies and shitheals and were looked down upon. \u201cHow can they live like that?\u201d The people with money would ask, as if being poor was a choice. As if they were just lazy and all it would take to get out of poverty was to get a job\u2026\u2026but there were no fucking jobs. The owners sent out more handbills then they needed to. Why? Because the more men begging for a job the less the owners would have to pay them. Supply and demand. The greedy sons a bitches wanted to pay as little as possible, and that is exactly what they did. The Okies did not have a union of course.\u201cAnd the great owners, who must lose their land in an upheaval, the great owners with access to history, with eyes to read history and to know the great fact: when property accumulates in too few hands it is taken away. And that companion fact: when a majority of the people are hungry and cold they will take by force what they need. And the little screaming fact that sounds through all history: repression works only to strengthen and knit the repressed. The great owners ignored the three cries of history. The land fell into fewer hands, the number of the dispossessed increased, and every effort of the great owners was directed at repression. The money was spent for arms, for gas to protect the great holdings, and spies were sent to catch the murmuring of revolt so that it might be stamped out. The changing economy was ignored, plans for the change ignored; and only means to destroy revolt were considered, while the causes of revolt went on.\u201dWho are the \u201cgreat owners\u201d today? The Walton family (of Walmart), six of them, have the same amount of money as the bottom 40% of Americans. That is 124,720,000 people, people. $93 billion\u2026..BILLION and they want more, more money than could be spent in several lifetimes. They don\u2019t need it all, but the rest of America does. Do you think the Walton\u2019s might have an interest in keeping people poor? Go check out who\u2019s in that store at 3am. Let\u2019s also take a look at who is running against President Obama. Mittens is so rich that he doesn\u2019t even know what a doughnut is, and he\u2019s fighting for the Waltons and all of the 1 %. He\u2019s so rich he thinks he is entitled to the office and \u201cus people\u201d do not need to see his tax returns\u2026\u2026the nerve of us, move on. We need to sit down, shut up, and stop asking questions because he, being a rich bastard, is an \u201cowner\u201d and we should know our place. Not bloody likely.\u201cOur people are good people; our people are kind people. Pray God some day kind people won\u2019t all be poor. Pray God some day a kid can eat.And the associations of owners knew that some day the praying would stop.And there\u2019s the end.\u201dAlso posted at Shelfinflicted"}, {"userName": "Helen

the many families of farmers fallen on hard times in the 1930s. The exhausting search for work, food and a roof over the head, put a strain on human dignity, and degrade the soul, making unexpected even genuine attitudes of solidarity by those who share the same destiny. But hunger and very poor living conditions sow grains of desperation, from which gems of gall immediately sprout.\"In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage\" seems to be more a statement than a warning. We are human, and we are destined to fight the injustice by the uprising.\"And this you can know, fear the time when Manself will not suffer and die for a concept, for this one quality is the foundation of Manself, and this one quality is man, distinctive in the universe\"And then Tom Joad, one of the protagonists of the biblical exodus, who is unable to tolerate the anguish that his loved ones suffer, becomes the symbol and the incarnation of the human being of John Steinbeck.

of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.This book really gets my goat. Those poor, dirty Joads. So poor and so, so dirty. After being displaced from their Oklahoma farm following the Dust Bowl storms that wreck their crops and cause them to default on their loans, the Joads find themselves a family of migrants in search of work and food. They join a stream of hundreds of thousands of other migrant families across the United States to what they believe to be the prosperous valleys of California. Only once they arrive, they discover that there is nothing prosperous about it\u2014not only is there a serious shortage of work (mostly caused by an overabundance of labor that came with the influx of so many other migrant families), but they also have to contend with growing anti-migrant sentiment among the local population and wealthy landowners who think nothing of taking advantage of them in their state of vulnerability. Without proper labor laws protecting worker\u2019s rights and no trade unions to represent their interests, the Joads are severely underpaid for whatever work they do manage to find, and they simply fall deeper and deeper into despondency.The reason this gets my goat is \u2018cause it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Yes, the Joads are uneducated and wouldn\u2019t qualify for anything more than basic manual labor. Yes, it is the Great Depression and this is not an easy time to find a job even for skilled workers. And yes, they are a family of 47 and they probably look pretty ridiculous all crammed up in the back of their makeshift pickup truck. But gosh darn it, if only they had unions! If only they had fair labor standards to guarantee them a minimum wage! If only they had the protection of government legislation to prohibit wealthy landowners from colluding to keep prices high and wages low!Which leads me to wonder\u2026 what would Ayn Rand think of all this? After all, aren\u2019t labor unions and economic regulation precisely what she argues against? By that account, if Atlas Shrugged is the supposed Bible of right-wing thinkers, then I\u2019d have to say that The Grapes of Wrath might just be its antithesis. But the real difference, as far as I can tell, is that while Atlas Shrugged represents a crazy woman\u2019s vision of a whack job world that could never actually exist, John Steinbeck tells it like it is, and how it was, for so many hard working Americans who were taken advantage of under a system that did nothing to protect them. And what\u2019s even more remarkable is that Steinbeck\u2019s characters (whom, by the way, Rand would refer to as \u201cmoochers\u201d\u2014just thought we should be clear on that) make Dagny Taggart and Henry Reardon look like a couple of pussies. What is it Ma Joad says? That if you\u2019re in trouble or hurt or need, to \u201cgo to poor people\u2014for they\u2019re the only ones that\u2019ll help.\u201dThis is a novel about the working poor, and it should serve to remind us what can go horribly wrong in an unregulated economy."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/866373-jennifer", "userReview": "*Review contains a partial spoiler*If you read enough reviews, you'll notice that most of the people who gave this book 1 or 2 stars had to read the book for a high school class. Most of the 4 and 5 star ratings came from those who read it as adults. I recommend listening to those who read it as adults. Many people hate the ending, but I thought it was great. Creepy? Yes, but there was an immense amount of beauty and generosity in that creepy little ending. At one point in the story, Ma tol' Rosasharn that it ain't all about her (most high school kids think everything is all about them, which is probably one reason they couldn't enjoy this book or most other classics they are forced to read). Realizing this at the very end made Rosasharn crack her first smile in ages (at least that's my take on the mysterious smile). I wasn't disappointed in the lack of closure at the end, because the closure came in the middle when Ma said, \"Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good an' they die out. But we keep a'comin'. We're the people that live. They can't wipe us out; they can't lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa, 'cause we're the people.\" So you know they will be fine whether life continues to be a struggle or not. They will be better off than the rich man with the million acres they talked about - \"If he needs a million acres to make him feel rich, seems to me he needs it 'cause he feels awful poor inside hisself, and if he's poor in hisself, there ain't no million acres gonna make him feel rich, an' maybe he's disappointed that nothin' he can do'll make him feel rich.\" Another good quote is \"I'm learnin' one thing good...If you're in trouble or hurt or need - go to the poor people.

Imagine having nowhere to go, but still crossing the desert in hope of finding a future after your past was wiped out by human failure, greed and environmental carelessness? Imagine not being welcome when you arrive, with nothing but what your family vehicle can carry ... \u201cHow can we live without our lives? How will we know it's us without our past?\u201dImagine nobody caring about those thousands of \"us\" who lost their identities with their farms and livelihoods. Immigrants are always also emigrants, and they carry the memory of being somebody, somewhere, in a distant past. To treat them as if they existed in a historical vacuum is as cruel as it is common, and it is the recurring topic of Steinbeck's heartbreaking writing.Steinbeck is one of those authors that I love unconditionally, more and more with each reading experience. I once travelled from where I lived in Texas to visit Steinbeck country in California - looking for his traces in Monterey and Salinas, always accompanied by his complete works, from hilarious short novels to the heavy epic novels of good and evil. In the end, I discovered his characters in the faces I saw on the road, I smelled his descriptions of nature in the humid or dry, dusty air, I heard his dialogues in the everyday exchanges on markets and in hot small town streets. I love them all, each one in my carefully kept Steinbeck collection. Asked by one of my children the other day which Steinbeck had influenced me most, I thought I was going to give an evasive, diplomatic answer, not making a statement for or against any specific story. Instead I heard myself say:\"The Grapes of Wrath!\"And the moment I said it I knew that I meant it. It may not exactly be my favourite Steinbeck, but definitely the one I feel uncomfortably, chillingly getting under my skin immediately. Just recalling the voices of the characters makes me shiver - as they suffer through the ordeal of fleeing from the Dust Bowl, that environmental catastrophe caused by greed and paid for by individual families, to a Californian paradise which doesn't welcome newcomers. The poverty, the suffering, the love and despair - it is tangible in each sentence, in each story line!Family saga, social study, historical document, political standpoint, ethical statement on compassion and greed - it is all there, but invisible under the masterfully crafted story, which has its own quality, beyond the message on the essential needs and worries of poor, common people without protective networks. I don't know how to close this review, as I am not done with this novel at all, despite having read it several times. But one quote shall stand as a warning to those who believe their wealth protects them against being humans, and feeling poor for behaving poorly:\u201cIf he needs a million acres to make him feel rich, seems to me he needs it 'cause he feels awful poor inside hisself, and if he's poor in hisself, there ain't no million acres gonna make him feel rich, an' maybe he's disappointed that nothin' he can do 'll make him feel rich.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Mar\u00eda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17754092-mar-a", "userReview": "Me ha encantado.

Tractors invade the barren plains, ruining crops, demolishing houses, stripping farmers of their livelihood, leaving only billows of dust and ransacked land behind. Bewildered families choke with disbelief at the lame excuses of the landowners who blame a monster bigger than them. Not the severe droughts, not the iron machines, not their useless greed, but the bank, the bank forced them to do it. And so a pilgrimage of thousands of destitute families to the promised land of California where the valleys are ripe with fresh hope and sweet grapes begins, and the roads become a limbless reptile hauling an endless tail of wrecked trucks and rootless people who have exchanged their living heritage for the expectation of honest jobs and decent lives. A debunked list of thwarted illusions and betrayed promises awaits the Joads, the protagonists of Steinbeck\u2019s tale of protest and epitomization of countless second rate Americans who had to endure the degradation of being treated like cattle, the marginalization of inhuman living conditions and the bigoted treatment of their fellow citizens as a result of the Great Depression\u2019s climatic, social and economic debacle.More than seventy years later, Steinbeck's denouncement of the effects of an abusive system that endorses laws of supply and demand over humanity and social justice mirrors the precarious situation of many developed countries that are struggling against unmanageable unemployment rates and massive migratory movements, which elevates the writer\u2019s prophetic voice of protest to an enduring literary classic that speaks on its own.\u201cThe Grapes of Wrath\u201d is composed of juxtaposed symphonic alternating movements. Short, jazzy and lyrical chapters combining journalistic language with spiritual rhythms give an atemporal view on the migrant drama, which in turn arise as premonitory for the interweaved longer narrative chapters depicting the Joad family\u2019s exodus to California and their symbolic plight for moral equity.Framed in bold dialogue and raw dialectical jargon, a menagerie of styles, dissonant voices, folk wisdom and biblical imagery gives shape to the mystic soul of the book, which orbits around two concentric points: land and family.When the Joads are obliged to abandon their farm they are also deprived of their dignity, of their ancestry, of their roots. Once the land is lost, drastic developments threaten the family unit but Ma Joad, tough and vulnerable mother, resilient and respectful wife, gentle and brawly cornerstone of the Joads' collective willpower, and her son Tom, the male counterpoint to Ma\u2019s ability to adapt, personify the indignation that fuels the spark of revolt to preserve self-respect in front of implacable adversity. But when hope becomes desperation, desperation melts in prayer, prayer degenerates into hunger and hunger ferments in wrath and the skies break lose in floods of misfortune and a mother caresses the disfigured face of her son in the dark, the debilitated bonds that kept the family together shatter silently in fragmented impotence and paralyzing vexation, leaving only one absolute, pulsating soul that speaks for all people, the ghost of Tom Joad: \u201cThen it don\u2019t matter. Then I\u2019ll be aroun\u2019 in the dark. I\u2019ll be ever\u2019where \u2013 wherever you look. Wherever they\u2019s a fight so hungry people can eat, I\u2019ll be there. Wherever they\u2019s a cop beatin\u2019 up a guy. I\u2019ll be there. I\u2019ll be in the way kids laugh when they\u2019re hungry an\u2019 they know supper\u2019s ready. An\u2019 when our folks eat the stuff they raise an\u2019 live in the houses they build \u2013 why, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d And this is how Steinbeck\u2019s polivalent epic evolves from socio-economic determinism to numinous spirituality, for the fury of losing land and lineage metamorphoses into a chant of redemptive love for mankind that overcomes individual boundaries, temporal limits and material needs and rekindles a perdurable harmonious faith that can only be born of the most inexhaustible and universal compassion. \u201cThe people in flight from terror behind \u2013 strange things happen to them, some bitterly cruel and some so beautiful that the faith is refired forever.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol", "userReview": "OMGOSH!

The Grapes of Wrath is one of those books that for years I'd been embarrassed I hadn't read yet. I was familiar with other works by John Steinbeck, but somehow I hadn't gotten around to this classic of American literature until now.Pardon my language, but holy shit is this book good. I was blown away by the scope of the work, how it followed not just the Joad family traveling from Oklahoma to California, but it also meditated on the problems of all the displaced families of the Great Depression, and on all the poor farmers who were driven from their homes and their lands by Big Banks and Greedy Corporations. Many of those farmers ended up in California, hoping to find work and a decent living, but instead found menial wages, prejudice, hunger and disease. It's a devastating chapter of American history.I listened to this on audio, read by the talented actor Dylan Baker, and I would highly recommend his performance. I also recommend the 1940 film version directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda, which was mostly faithful to the book. In the movie, Fonda seems to be carrying the entire weight of the Depression on his shoulders.I think what is most alarming about reading The Grapes of Wrath in the early 21st century is recognizing how relevant the themes are today, because the country is still run by big banks and greedy corporations. Karl Marx was right: The working class is oppressed, y'all.Five stars for the impressive John Steinbeck. Five stars for the Joad family, searching for a new life. And five stars for Dylan Baker's excellent narration.Favorite Quotes\"There ain't no sin and there ain't no virtue.

While the story itself is set on the times of the Great Depression, back in the 1930s and 1940s, we can still trace parallels with the contemporary world we\u2019re living in more than 60 years later. Sadly, still to this day, we can see in the news that there are people working for less than the minimal wage and under slave labor conditions.To tell us this story, John Steinbeck presents to us the life of the Joads: a big united, poor family who lives in Oklahoma under a tenancy system until their lives start to derail - because of the drought, tightness of money, agricultural changes (now a tractor can put ten families out of work\u2026) -, which leads them to a hopeful journey to California in search of jobs, dignity, happiness and means to fulfill their simple dreams: Ma Joad would love to have her \u201clittle white house\u201d; all Grandpa wanted was to have grapes soaking his beard; and Rose of Sharon fantasized about having ice in her house.Slow paced and packed with long descriptions, I imagined it would take me up to three weeks to get through the book by my reading standards; it took me nine days instead. It was impossible to not start caring about the family right away or to stop desiring that they would have a deserved happy ending where they would finally find some relief. As the pages turned though, I realized that the Joads represented the lives of thousands and that their fates would likely be consistent to the sore reality of what happened to the majority of the migrants on the same road as them. In order to help us to realize the bigger picture that he wanted to portray, Steinbeck used smaller chapters, that felt almost like interludes, showing us the similar situation that unidentified people were enduring.A big highlight for me was that the author succeeded in making his characters realistic, and it was plain to see that their behaviors were in line with their personalities in every one of their actions (i.e., Tom was painted since the beginning as being someone suspicious of other people\u2019s intentions and always reacting, fighting back because of that - maybe because of the time he spent in McAlester prison for committing homicide). Having known and been around tenant farmers myself, it was clear to me how Steinbeck really captured their persona, temper and features while conceiving these characters. In doing some research about him and the writing of his book, I found out that he actually bought a car, drove to Oklahoma and followed the migrants\u2019 path along Route 66 to California. Before completing The Grapes of Wrath, he wrote some reports on the subject and was working on an unfinished novel called The Oklahomans.One of the striking traces I recognized in the Joads - and mainly everyone they met in their journey, but best represented in the book by the Wilson and the Wainwright families - was that they were truly willing to share whatever they had even under those trying times. This compassionate way of thinking and their mentality of doing good in order to receive good things ironically turned out to be working against them in more than one occasion.Throughout their ride to California, they\u2019ve encountered many individuals who had been there, looked for jobs, (some even actually worked) but instead decided to go back home because they saw that it wasn\u2019t as dreamlike as the handbills made it out to be. So the Joads were warned about it more than once but still decided to make it, convincing themselves that it\u2019d turn out different for them because they would do everything accordingly, they would work properly and be honest. Their simplistic logic blindsided them into not realizing there were bigger interests in the game. Also because of that, it was near impossible for them to understand why the big shots (through the big companies) with millions and so much land could still be so greedy, still wanting to turn a higher profit, in detriment of their (and thousands of) family\u2019s most basic needs.In some ways - the fate of a family representing the social conditions of that time, having to bear to that situation apparently because of a few selected individuals in quest for (more) power (isn\u2019t that what it all always comes down to?) and the inevitable cause vs consequences analysis -, this novel is analogous to Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace, where we understand the effects that the French invasion had in Russia through the lives of (mainly) the Rost\u00f3vs and the Bolkonskys.For film buffs: I\u2019ve only watched The Grapes of Wrath directed by John Ford, and I recommend it. Although there are some changes, it stays somewhat faithful to the story and the acting is on point all around, with Jane Darwell (Ma Joad) deservingly winning an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. The major difference from the novel is that the film adaptation switched some events and it ends in a high note, leaving us hopeful and optimistic, under the impression that everything will turn out well. The controversial ending of the book also isn\u2019t on the film.Rating: putting aside all of the social, political and economic analysis - the book was actually banned in the USA and deemed as propaganda -, the story of the Joads is still very compelling and moving - even though Steinbeck was also accused of too much sentimentalism. It was heartbreaking to wander with them in their unfortunate journey that, sadly, left us with little hope to be expected for the family\u2019s fate: 5 stars."}, {"userName":

I didn't get on with it at all despite trying to read it twice. I gave up about a third of the way through in the end. It is about the life of one American family during the Great Depression. There is some beautiful creative writing in places but the story itself is so very slow. It just didn't hold my interest due to the lengthy dialogue between the characters who were talking about nothing in particular. It was like being a fly on the wall at a really dull tea party where everyone is making small talk. It seems they were allowing waves of nostalgia to sweep over them--forcing everyone to listen as one by one they recounted monotonous tales from their youth.I guess I probably shouldn't make such comments about something labelled a classic, but for me it was not. As a Christian, I also found the language, particularly the regular blasphemy, offensive and would probably have stopped reading earlier for that reason had it not been a classic. I also didn't appreciate the early scenes where the local vicar was using his position to bed all of the young women in his parish.I don't recommend this book due to the language, the sexual content and the monotony, I'm sorry I wasted a few hours on it.

John Steinbeck has a way of depicting society and people in a raw and honest way that leaves you with a hollow feeling inside, and yet you devour his books because they are so amazing. In \"The Grapes of Wrath\" we meet Tom, who has just been released from prison on probation, as well as his family who's about to move to the West because banks and tractors have evicted them from their own home and land. It's USA in the middle of the Great Depression and times are changing. Everyone is moving from East to West in order to find work and survive these new and abhorrent circumstances. In many ways, the writing of this book is very straight-forward, but at the same time it digs deeper when you read between the lines and look behind the characters' behaviour and dialogue. I was especially fond of how Steinbeck, at every other chapter, stops up to depict the conditions in America at that point in time; whether it be about a car seller and his greediness, the devastating conditions for the workers in the fruit fields or a turtle. I was a big fan, and especially the ending left me speechless. Until now, \"East of Eden\" has been my favourite of Steinbeck's, but \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is a close runner-up."}, {"userName": "Nandakishore Varma", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma", "userReview": "NEW DELHI: There has been an upward trend in cases of farmer suicides in Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka and Punjab recently, besides reporting of instances in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, says an Intelligence Bureau note submitted to the Modi government late last week.The December 19 report, marked to national security adviser Ajit Kumar Doval, principal secretary to the Prime Minister Nripendra Mishra, and agriculture ministry, among others, has blamed rising farmer suicides on erratic monsoon (at the onset stage) this year, outstanding loans, rising debt, low crop yield, poor procurement rate of crops and successive crop failure. It also linked the agriculturists' woes to a depleted water table, unsuitable macro-economic policies with respect to taxes, non-farm loans and faulty prices of import and export. - The Times of India, Dec. 26, 2014More than 270,000 Indian cotton farmers have killed themselves since 1995. Campaigners say a contributing factor may be the high price of genetically modified seeds flooding the market, which is piling pressure on poorly paid growers, forcing many into a cycle of unmanageable debt. - The Guardian, May 5, 2014There are some books which hit you with an impact like a sledgehammer. The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck is such a book.I read it during a period of recuperation after a severe bout of viral flu during my late teens. I never knew who Steinbeck was before I read this book, and I had only a sketchy idea of what the Great Depression was. After I finished it, I had become a fan of the author, and my political views had shifted permanently to the left of the spectrum.The Western States nervous under the beginning change. Texas and Oklahoma, Kansas and Arkansas, New Mexico, Arizona, California. A single family moved from the land. Pa borrowed money from the bank, and now the bank wants the land. The land company--that's the bank when it has land--wants tractors, not families on the land. Is a tractor bad? Is the power that turns the long furrows wrong? If this tractor were ours it would be good--not mine, but ours. If our tractor turned the long furrows of our land, it would be good. Not my land, but ours. We could love that tractor then as we have loved this land when it was ours. But the tractor does two things--it turns the land and turns us off the land. There is little difference between this tractor and a tank. The people are driven, intimidated, hurt by both. We must think about this.One man, one family driven from the land; this rusty car creaking along the highway to the west. I lost my land, a single tractor took my land. I am alone and bewildered. And in the night one family camps in a ditch and another family pulls in and the tents come out. The two men squat on their hams and the women and children listen. Here is the node, you who hate change and fear revolution. Keep these two squatting men apart; make them hate, fear, suspect each other. Here is the anlarge of the thing you fear. This is the zygote. For here \"I lost my land\" is changed; a cell is split and from its splitting grows the thing you hate--\"We lost our land.\" The danger is here, for two men are not as lonely and perplexed as one. And from this first \"we\" there grows a still more dangerous thing: \"I have a little food\" plus \"I have none.\" If from this problem the sum is \"We have a little food,\" the thing is on its way, the movement has direction. Only a little multiplication now, and this land, this tractor are ours. The two men squatting in a ditch, the little fire, the side-meat stewing in a single pot, the silent, stone-eyed women; behind, the children listening with their souls to words their minds do not understand. The night draws down. The baby has a cold. Here, take this blanket. It's wool. It was my mother's blanket--take it for the baby. This is the thing to bomb. This is the beginning--from \"I\" to \"we.\"If you who own the things people must have could understand this, you might preserve yourself. If you could separate causes from results, if you could know Paine, Marx, Jefferson, Lenin, were results, not causes, you might survive. But that you cannot know. For the quality of owning freezes you forever into \"I,\" and cuts you off forever from the \"we.\"The Western States are nervous under the beginning change. Need is the stimulus to concept, concept to action. A half-million people moving over the country; a million more restive, ready to move; ten million more feeling the first nervousness.And tractors turning the multiple furrows in the vacant land.Has there been a change? I don't think so. The news items quoted above are only a sample.The tractors of capitalism are still mowing the vacant land....and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.Let's hope the world sees sense before the grapes of wrath are harvested."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james", "userReview": "Book Review\n\n3 out of 5 stars to The Grapes of Wrath, written in 1939 by John Steinbeck. I might have an unpopular opinion when it comes to this book, as it was fine but nothing fantastic for me. I admit, I read this in middle school, nearly 25 years ago, and never went back to read it again. I tend not to like books about awful things as the main plot. I don't mind when bad things happen, or circumstances change, but when the entire book is about the pain and suffering of a family, it doesn't usually rise to the top of my TBR. I might consider giving this one another chance, but you have some major convincing to do. I like Steinbeck, too, so it's not so much an issue with the author as it is with the topic. The writing is strong. The imagery is good. The characters are well drawn. The setting is very detailed. But when it comes to the plight of a family against the hardships all around them, it's a difficult read. Part of my issue may have been a connection with the story. While I certainly don't have a real-life connection with my favorite books (mysteries, thrillers...), you need to have an understanding and recognition between what's happening and how you live. Coming from the northeast, in a major metropolitan city, 50+ years after these times, it doesn't start off as something I'm familiar with. I usually don't read things about this time period or space for those reasons. If the characters called to me, I might have liked it more. Don't get me wrong... it's a good book. And it's got a place in the world of classics. And it helped highlight a lot of wrongs that people weren't aware of. And maybe because I learned those lessons from other books and other places, this one just didn't seem all that top notch to me. That said, it's Steinbeck, so there is something of value here. No one can tell reality like he can.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

They headed to California in hope of a new life, instead their hardships multiplied.Tom Joad, as played by Henry Fonda, is the face of John Ford\u2019s excellent film version from 1940; however, Ma Joad is the heart and soul of the book. As the male characters give in to fear, rage and depression, Ma Joad tries desperately to hold her family together.It\u2019s easy to see why this is a revered classic. Steinbeck\u2019s writing is brimming with tension, poignancy and some of the greatest characters in American literature. When I home schooled my son, this was one of his favorites and as a measure to its greatness, we still talk about it today, especially the quasi-mystical symbol-laden ending.

Yawn. I was off to the mall with my tight abs to find some jeans that would accentuate my vacuous mind.The same copy then sat on my various book shelves ever since. I've never been able to sell it or give it away, so finally, at 42, with far looser abs and a pair of fat jeans in the closet, I decided to give it an actual try. Now, the ladies at my book club will tell you. . . I'm not easily won over by any book, though I do believe that a good book is a good book. . . merely because YOU like it. A good book may not have any other merit other than you thought the protagonist was sweet. Or cute. But, a great book? Well, a great book is a whole different story. A great book has nothing to do with YOU, or at least not YOU individually. A great book pays tribute to the collective YOU, our collective consciousness. A great book garners the support of Divinity and has the staying power of the people through multiple generations and years. And this is a great book. One of the best ever written. This is the rare Great American Novel, up there with Lonesome Dove, The Catcher in the Rye and Gone with the Wind. I can only imagine that Steinbeck's hands were shaking as he removed the last page from the typewriter (yes, writers used something called typewriters back then). I picture a silent room as he experienced a true moment of awe. I like to think he had tears in his eyes, or that they slid slowly down his face, just as mine did throughout this read. As Frost would say, \"no tears in the writer, no tears in the reader.\"Believe me, if you are over 35 and have a heart, you can not read this novel without tears, laughter, anger and awe. This novel is better than approximately 95% of novels currently on this planet. I'd like to travel back in time and cup Steinbeck's face in my hands and say, \"You did it, John. You did it.\""}, {"userName": "Ahmed", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11260920-ahmed", "userReview": "\u0623\u0646\u0627

from their land by the combined effects of ecological disaster, rampant capitalism and the Great Depression. The narrative follows the family as they travel from Oklahoma to California in search of work, along with hundreds of thousands of others in the same situation. Woven into the story of the Joads are chapters dealing with issues such as the attitude of Californians to the influx of migrant workers and the exploitation and mistreatment to which they were subjected. There is nothing about this novel which I don't love: Steinbeck's wonderful use of language, his ability to create memorable characters, his descriptions of the natural world, his use of symbolism and - probably most of all - his passion. Steinbeck is not a writer who hides himself behind his words: his humanism, his left-wing political views, his compassion for those whose story he tells are all right there in the text. Listening to the audiobook - which is superbly narrated by John Chancer - I felt I was getting to know Steinbeck as well as his characters. One of the things I most like about Steinbeck's writing is the sense that he wrote what he knew, not just what he had imagined or researched. When Steinbeck writes about displaced people, the reader is sure that he knew such people personally. When he describes a land turtle, it's because he had observed how a land turtle moves. When he has his characters carry out repairs to their truck, he knows what they would do because he's carried out those same repairs himself. Steinbeck lives and breathes in his writing. While this is the story of \"Okies\" in depression-era California, it's also the story of all those who have been forced to leave their homes - whether because of natural disaster, economic crisis, or conflict - and found themselves poor, hungry and desperate in a place where they are not welcome. It's a story which is repeated over and over, all over the world. The novel made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me angry and it made me sad. However, it also gave me hope. There is an essential humanity and a deep vein of hope in Steinbeck's characters: bad things happen to them, but they work hard to survive. And they know the power of love, of loyalty and of connectedness to each other. I will be forever grateful that a stopover in Monterey during a drive from San Francisco to Los Angeles prompted me to finally start reading Steinbeck. I'd give this book ten stars if I could. It's quite simply a masterpiece."}, {"userName": "Rae Meadows", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3184-rae-meadows", "userReview": "I had read The Grapes of Wrath before, and I purposefully didn't re-read it while writing a novel set in the same period for fear I would somehow be influenced by it or be so intimidated I'd be paralyzed. So with my own book behind me I finally had the pleasure of reading The Grapes of Wrath again. Does it hold up? It does, though it's not perfect. The story of the Joads is fantastic, and Ma Joad is a rich and surprising character. Steinbeck's prose is deft and evocative, and those famous bits like the turtle crossing the road and the ending, when Rose of Sharon nurses the dying man, are great. At times the novel is a bit overwrought. This jaded reader had to stretch to accommodate some of the characters' naivete, particularly that of Rose of Sharon who is so dim she's a little hard to believe. (The John Ford film version takes the melodrama a little far for my taste.) The interspersed chapters, where Steinbeck attempts to go broad and tell the larger story about what is happening in America at that time works less well and structure ends up feeling a little clunky. However, Steinbeck was not just writing a novel, he was writing for social change and I am not the intended audience. But the journey of the Joads, as poor, struggling migrants who have not where to go, no where to make a life for their family, but who deserve dignity and fight for it, is particularly resonant right now. And for that I am grateful."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5304930-mary", "userReview": "Absorbing and maddening and depressing.

The dust sifted up by the sweltering wind sought refuge on their dingy shoulders and hair. Women stood at the door, casting a tentative glance at their men with their bewildered eyes. Children stood docilely beside their Ma, showing restrained obedience: they knew when to play and when not to; their instinct prodded them to respect the silence pervading the air.An air of apprehension, uncertainty, and darkness pervaded. Air had the smell of terror which traversed their windpipes like chunks.Disquieting silence.The \u2018Monster\u2019- the bank- was ravenously hungry for money. The delegates arrived in cars several minutes before, and bartered their soul, their land, for the unpaid debt. The \u2018Monster\u2019, as it is soul-less and incorporeal, never knew to empathize with the mortals and their souls: it never knew/bothered the land that was being snatched away from them had the salinity of their sweat and acrid smell of their blood, nor it never knew that it was tractoring out not only their abode but their timeless memories hovering close to it.\"Banks breathe profits; they eat interest on money. If they don't get it, they die the way you die without air, without side-meat.\" The Monster, with the wanton desires, wanted to eat money and grow, wanted to engulf all , without a trace of compassion as it is unlike man, and people could never shoot the bank because it was disembodied. The delegates didn't know who the bank was; they simply obeyed its orders. It became imperative that they should leave bereft of their soul, their land. They were bound to wander in unknown realms like aliens, as their 40 acres were not just their abode, but their world where the fence was the boundary to it. The confused and despaired folks squatted again, thinking.\"Can we live without our lives? How will we know it\u2019s us without our past? No. Leave it. Burn it.\"The Handbill- Ticket to paradise :A person wakes up to utmost darkness. He convinces himself he isn\u2019t dreaming. He scrabbles in the dark for a physical support to lean on, but was fruitless. A pang of despair, terror and uncertainty stabs him and chokes him. His consciousness slowly fades away, and frantically he makes a futile attempt of walking in circles only to reach a more uncertain position. Hope melts into despair. Courage melts into terror. Conscience melts into blankness. He begins doubting his existence. But on the verge of devolving into a delirium, ALAS! , A blob of light flickers at distance. He slowly regains his lost faculties as he has a direction now, with the blob of light beckoning him as if by winking. He walks to the light, forgetting the darkness enveloping him, in quick strides, with bated breath and hammering heart, as if worried the light may die down before he reaches it.The handbill was such a blob of flickering light, hanging precariously between illusion and reality. The handbill, orange colored, was their hope, and they carried the orange colored \u2018hope\u2019 safely in their breast pockets.The materialization of a direction imparted the family a new-found hope and spirit. The handbill was like a mirror image of their needs in printed format.\"Maybe we can start again,in the new rich land\u2014in California, where the fruit grows. We'll start over.\"\"They met at the most important place, near the truck...this was the new hearth, the living center of the family.\"They quickly decided to move, without tarrying any longer in their lost land, which was now being rapidly tractored out. They sold everything, gathered up the cash, bought a vehicle to haul off their remnant belongings, and had set off to the land of paradise-California.-where their dreams, fully awake, resided.Grandpa\u2019s words are echoing in my mind now:\"...Jus' let me get out to California where I can pick me an orange when I want it. Or grapes. There's a thing I ain't never had enough of. Gonna get me a whole big bunch of grapes off a bush, or whatever, an' I'm gonna squash 'em on my face an' let 'em run offen my chin.\" Route 66- Road to Disillusionment:The gradual realization of the predicament of the country was rendered by the presence of thousands of cars and trucks that marched along the 66, all moving with the strength of the same \u2018orange colored hope\u2019 safely residing in the pockets. Thousands of miles to traverse, multitude of hungry children and fatigued senile folks, thousands of faulty cars and rickety trucks \u2013 This was the great migration of the \u2018Okies\u2019( The west\u2019s vituperation against the vagrants, disparaging them by calling \u2018Okies\u2019 and \u2018Thieves\u2019) . Endless days on the road transformed the farm men to migrant men, and the road became their reality, and the truck home. At night, The Road side ditches teemed with campers, and they built tents and shared food.\"Every night a world created, complete with furniture- friends made and enemies established; a world complete with braggarts and with cowards, with quiet men, with humble men, with kindly men. Every night relationships that make a world, established; and every morning the world torn down like a circus.\"But they never knew about the Cataclysmic disillusionment awaiting them at the other end, the destination.66 is the path of a people in flight, refugees from dust and shrinking land, from the thunder of tractors and invasion, from the twisting winds that howl up out of Texas, from floods that bring no richness to the land and steal what little richness is there.Writing: John Steinbeck is a dexterous writer. He adroitly enlaces the main track (featuring Joad family) with numerous side tracks, which speak to us like an omnipresent narrator, which proffer a profound and comprehensive prism through which the general movement of events and tribulations of the migrants are accentuated and expounded, thus rendering the main track (Journey of Joads) more poignant and painful.The Prose is subtle yet beautiful,simple yet overpowering.Joad FamilyThe main characters of the Novel are : Grandpa , Grandma, Pa, Ma, Tom, Al, Casy,Rose of Sharon, Connie, Ruthie and Winfield. The biggest danger that always seemed impending was the breaking up of the family, and with the unforeseen deaths and running away of certain members of the family, Ma\u2019s words of consternation rang loud : \"Fambly\u2019s breakin\u2019 up\" !The Joad family always took a gander at Ma and studied her countenance, whenever they stumbled at a crisis, as if to confirm whether to worry about something or not, and thus the family\u2019s present mood was based on how Ma handled the situation at hand. Ma,on the other hand, knew about the family\u2019s trust in her very well, and it became incumbent upon her to remain as stolid as possible, without betraying her deep welling emotions. Pa, who was encumbered by the tribulations of the family and lack of money, had his mind and spirit plunged into torpidity, and which eventually degraded temporarily his status as the head of the family. He knew about it and sighed in despair or muttered gibberish, as he witnessed Ma taking over the family throne. To which Ma replied:\"Women can change better\u2019n a man,\u201d Ma said soothingly. \u201cWoman got all her life in her arms. Man got it all in his head.\"The stoic courage in Ma, her outward coolness, indubitably prevented the family from being downtrodden by the oppression of brutal capitalists and enraged Californians. Tom, who discovered her latent qualities, started to emanate an unprecedented kind of love for his Ma that was imbued with respect and awe.An instance where Ma comforted Pregnant Rose of Sharon has piqued my attention:They's a time of change, an' when that comes, dyin' is a piece of all dyin', and bearin' is a piece of all bearin', an' bearin' an' dyin' is two pieces of the same thing. An' then things ain't so lonely anymore. An' then a hurt don't hurt so bad.It is heart warming and Joyful to see how Ma carries the family through the perilous journey. This was what she said to her family one day:\"I'm learnin' one thing good...If you're in trouble or hurt or need - go to the poor people. They're the only ones that'll help - the only ones.\" Closing: Mother's milk, an elixir made from a concoction of unimpeachable elements of her life's force, imparts vitality and life to her new-born baby. Rose of Sharon's being, unaware of her baby's death, prepared an elixir too, like a tentative yet smiling mom who prepares a treat for her child returning from school. The land of California, now transformed into a circus of death and fiasco, where hunger and deluge waltzed around the life of destitute, a man dying of hunger sits numb in a hay-shack, waiting inadvertently for death. With a sudden lightning of unconditional love that bathed her whole being with a new light, Rose of Sharon, with her mother's knowing nod of consent, passes on the life-inducing elixir from her breast to the dying man, like a concerned mother, like mother of the whole humanity, as if teaching the world the quintessential principles of love and compassion, of the necessity of obliterating bigotry and malice from our hearts, and of God and His manifestation.Ma\u2019s words throw out an echo in the air, which reverberates resoundingly in my ears even after all the cacophony of sorrows and deluge around me has ceased to a numbing silence:\"Use' ta be the fambly was fust. It ain't so now. It's anybody. Worse off we get, the more we got to do.\" \u201c The deeper sorrow carves into your being, The more joy you can contain\u201d \u2013 Kahlil Gibran 5 stars on 5 !-gautamP.S : I hope I haven\u2019t divulged too much .

You've not read it??? Shit!!!! You don't know what you're missing!!!!!!!! If you've read it, then you will know exactly what I am talking about. I have lived on, or close to old route 66 for over 20 years of my life. I love the history of THE MOTHER ROAD. However, believe it or not, it was only in the past few years that I finally read this book! I had read other Steinbeck,and loved it,and for some reason, after owning a copy of the book since the 1980's, I just never got around to reading it. One of my life's regrets. Once I plowed in, I did nothing, but read till I finished it.....totally spellbound! I love the story of the Joads, with chapters mixed in on life,and history on the highway. The way he describes everything just makes me feel like I was an Okie myself, living it, breathing it, I was on that truck!After reading it for the very first time,and being totally blown away by the ending, I had to finally see the movie. However,after I finished that last page, for the very first time, I immediately turned back to the front of the book,and started reading it again, a 2nd time! Then ,not surprising to me, was the movie's ending is not at all like the book, but the movie is awesome as well. Nobody could have portrayed Tom Joad better then Henry Fonda. I have since read the book numerous times,and then we did it for our bookclub one month. I've rewatched the movie. I've traveled parts of the mother road. I can also recommend to you a fantastic history book on the history of Route 66. I've seen people at Ted Drews in St. Louis with copies of the history book clutched to their chests, because they are doing the route 66 vacation. I will ask them if they have been doing that type of vacation,and if they say yes, the next thing out of my mouth is... \"Have you read THE GRAPES OF WRATH??\" In most cases their response is yes. If it's no, I tell them they must rush to the nearest bookstore,and get a copy,and read it while on the road. I've had people ask me directions to the nearest bookstore so they can get a copy of the book.I had to buy a 2nd copy of the book because my original copy is about in shreds. I can't bring myself to throw it away, because when my eyes first experienced this mouth watering, rebel rousing story, it was that copy of the book!!There's also a book on the history of the novel,and how people in California burned it , if you'd like to know about that other book to read.Take care! Thanks for putting up with my enthusiasm for a classic piece of literature , such as this!Gary"}, {"userName": "Kinga", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110812-kinga", "userReview": "Dear John,There is no doubt in my mind that you are an excellent writer. And I am sure you know this. There is the Pulitzer and there is the Nobel. There are hundreds of editions worldwide and swarms of five star reviews. \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath\u201d is a book of great weight (literally and metaphorically). It\u2019s epic and as timeless as the history which repeats itself with a stubborn regularity. There have always been changes and there have always been people left behind, people who found themselves outside the whatever brave new world which had no place for them. And there have always been people who didn\u2019t want to know about them, who didn\u2019t want to hear about them. John, I know you wrote this book for them, so that no one could feign ignorance. And I get it, John, your heart is in the right place. You did all the right things. Those ever so gentle shifts in the patriarchal society? Brilliant. You know how to warm my feminist heart with the portrayal of Ma who takes the reins over from Pa. Although, are you trying to say it\u2019s a good thing that women take over when the world has gone to dogs or that it is another symptom of the world going to dogs? I don\u2019t know. Never mind. According to new goodreads review guidelines I can\u2019t judge you as a person, so let\u2019s leave it. Let\u2019s talk about your writing. A chapter about a turtle crossing a road? How did you pull that off? It should be proverbially boring and yet, I read it with a bated breath. Will the turtle make it to the other side of the road? Or that last final scene? Worth the seven hundred pages it takes to get to it.I grew to love the Joads, John, even though I know they\u2019re just pawns in your game. But again, I forgive you because your intentions are good. You\u2019re not calculating. You really do feel for all the Joads of the world and you want the world to feel it, too. You want us all to spare a thought for all the dispossessed of the world, those who loved earth and were one with it but they were forced to quit and abandon their land, to break that sacred bond and were replaced by soulless tractors and faceless banks and corporations. You\u2019re preaching to the choir, John. My heart is in the right place, too. But you know what, John? And please, don\u2019t take it the wrong way, I did love your book, but you weren\u2019t subtle. I like my men subtle."}], "description": "An alternate cover edition can be found here  and here.In stark and moving detail, John Steinbeck depicts the lives of ordinary people striving to preserve their humanity in the face of social and economic desperation. When the Joads lose their tenant farm in Oklahoma, they join thousands of others, traveling the narrow concrete highways toward California and the dream of a piece of land to call their own. Each night on the road, they and their fellow migrants recreate society: leaders are chosen, unspoken codes of privacy and generosity evolve, and lust, violence, and murderous rage erupt.A portrait of the bitter conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man's fierce reaction to injustice, and of a woman's quiet, stoical strength, \nThe Grapes of Wrath\n is a landmark of American literature, one that captures the horrors of the Great Depression as it probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America.", "title": "The Grapes of Wrath", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85029.The_Grapes_of_Wrath", "average": 3.94, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328369884l/85029.jpg", "reviews": 13955, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/585.John_Steinbeck", "name": "John Steinbeck"}], "type": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Historical", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85029.The_Grapes_of_Wrath", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4395.The_Grapes_of_Wrath", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12913405", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9974404-furore", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6932918", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114322-the-grapes-of-wrath", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10299514-las-uvas-de-la-ira", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4397.The_Grapes_of_Wrath", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4400.The_Grapes_of_Wrath", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20446835-as-vinhas-da-ira", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6915371", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17450042", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15777347-the-grapes-of-wrath", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/439686.The_Grapes_of_Wrath", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/890.Of_Mice_and_Men", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4406.East_of_Eden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5308.The_Pearl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4799.Cannery_Row", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5306.Travels_with_Charley"]}
