Cook publishing for winning one of their \"Free Book Friday\" Facebook contests. I never would have read or even picked up this book otherwise.I got about half way through the book, and I just didn't care to finish it. The characters are especially immature. 38 year old Holly reads like she's 21 - bad attitude on one hand, and then the awkward social acumen of a 10 year old. Her 50-something year old mother, Esther, is so imbedded in the darkness and secrets of her past that she comes across as cold and selfish. I have a hard time caring about what these two women do because their attitudes are so bad and they are so petty. And the idea that a devout Amish man would propose to an apostate within 24 hours of reuniting with her... doubtful.As for the writing, I didn't like the change between 1st and 3rd person as the author changed character perspective each chapter. She could have just as easily switched character perspective and stayed in 3rd person, but the switch to 1st was just awkward."}, {"userName": "Iola", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4164070-iola", "userReview": "Almost forty years have passed since Esther Gingerich and Samuel Fisher ran away from their Amish upbringing in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and headed west to live in a hippie commune and sing on the streets of San Francisco. They married, Samuel was drafted, shipped off to Vietnam and declared MIA, leaving Esther to raise their daughter alone because she was too proud to return to her family. Holly grew up believing her grandparents were dead, so it comes as a complete shock to her when Esther announces her intention to visit their Amish family \u2013 and wants Holly to come too.The story alternates between being told in the first person (by 37-year-old Holly) and the third person (from the point of view of Esther, Holly's mother). I continually found myself backtracking to the beginning of the chapter because I hadn't picked up the change. Call me fussy, but combining first person and third person doesn't ring true for me. It reminds me that I'm just reading a story about a bunch of made-up characters.This meant that I was noticing the writing rather than being carried along by the story, and as a result, I kept finding more things that bothered me While these were mostly minor, many of which were addressed later in the story, I found these glitches were pulling me out of the story. There were also contradictions in the plot line, and I found Holly hard to relate to. I could understand her anger and resentment towards her mother for having hidden her very alive family for so many years. She struck me as very self-centred, and I didn\u2019t really see this change as the story progressed.Overall, I can\u2019t say that I enjoyed Leaving Lancaster. Plot-wise, it had a solid underlying theme of honesty and forgiveness. But I found the writing style too distracting to allow me to get into and enjoy the story.Thanks to David C Cook and NetGalley for providing a free ebook for review."}, {"userName": "Deb", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7036169-deb", "userReview": "Many reviewers have done an excellent job describing the events of this book, so I will focus on what I liked and disliked about it. What I liked:The story flowed well and I found myself quickly turning pages to find out what was going to happen, especially as the women approached Pennsylvania.The details of Amish and Mennonite life were interesting and seemed to be well researched. They were what really kept me reading.The character of the Grandmother Anna, Esther\u2019s mother, was my favorite. I wanted her for my grandmother!What I disliked:I had a lot of trouble believing in the characters of Esther and Holly. Many of the things they said and did were not in keeping with what we knew about them. I could\u2019ve smacked Holly several times. A more spoiled, obnoxious woman I\u2019d be hard pressed to find.

This is the story of a woman coming home to the family she deserted, and the story of this woman's only daughter finally feeling at home with the family she never knew she had. Both women are afraid, scared and in desperate need of love, mercy, grace and each other. It could have been such a wonderful, beautiful, touching story, but the execution prevented it.This is the problem I had: the two female leads were so unlikable, their attitudes so undesirable, that it was very hard to find a redeeming quality in them. The thing is that both women appear to have been written with much younger versions in mind. Holly, the daughter, sounded like an 18 year old, and the mother... maybe a 30 something, but they were both so childish and immature in their thinking, actions and in the way they spoke that it was hard to sympathize with either one. They were fighting constantly, and contradicting their thoughts with their words; for instance, the daughter would do a little soul searching and realize that she needed to cut her mother some slack, but then almost immediately say something rude to her, out of the blue. She was a brat. Half the time I was expecting them to start a \"You did!\" \"I did not!\" \"Did, too!\" \"Did not!\" fight.Also, sometimes it felt as if the author had forgotten her own plot and previous scenes. For example, the mother mentioned her 5 brothers to her daughter, and Holly says: \"Mom, you're talking gibberish. First a mother. Now, five brothers?...\" Then, a few pages later, the mother mentions her five brothers again, and Holly says: \"Five brothers and this is the first I'm hearing of them?\" Really, no. Other times the characters' words and actions made no sense, their expressions and reactions coming out of nowhere.I will say this, however: the author did a beautiful job writing the big confrontation / redemption scene. It was beautifully written, expressed and managed. It was really moving. Also, Nathaniel was a very nicely written character, as well as Jeremiah and Beatrice.The novel did keep my interest as it slowly unraveled the mysteries and secrets behind this family and their actions. But not all was revealed, which I think means that there would be more to come.*I received a copy of this book from the publisher, David C.

Our story starts out with Ester receiving word that her mother is very ill and wants her to come home. Home is in Lancaster PA where her mother and siblings reside. Ester is a grown woman with a grown daughter of her own. Ester\u2019s husband has been mia since he left for the war, before Holly, (Ester\u2019s daughter) was even born. Ester\u2019s kept her past well hidden, and has told Holly that her mother had died and her relatives moved on. All Holly wants is a big family and a father. Imagine Holly\u2019s consternation when she finds out that her mom\u2019s been lying to her all along, that her mother is not dead, and she has a huge family\u2026. an Amish family waiting for her in Lancaster! My goodness what excitement she must feel\u2026 but what about the betrayal Holly feels from her mother lies? What must Holly feel about this and why did Ester withhold information about her family from her daughter? What happens when they go to Lancaster? I really liked the way the story flowed and loved the different points of view as the two main characters shared their thoughts and feelings by taking turns relaying their story in every other chapter. My thoughts do run to something that was rather unusual for an Amish fiction story. I thought there were too many subplots going on. It didn\u2019t really take away from the story, but it appeared as though there were too many ideas going through the author head at the same time. I hesitated as to whether to write that last statement, but then I felt my review wouldn\u2019t have been totally honest.I am glad to see there is another book out there (which thank you NetGalley for giving me access to it). I felt that the end of this book was a bit rushed and wanted the book to continue further.I would recommend this book to my friends that read Amish fiction."}, {"userName": "Anastacia ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1259503-anastacia", "userReview": "Leaving Lancaster is the first book in the series, and despite the name, the book has very little to do with the title. The book alternates between first person & third person - something I hate in a book - and makes it hard to get into any of the characters. In the beginning, I thought the book was taking place in the 60's and I was thrown for a loop when I realized it was actually taking place in current times - I also thought one of the main characters, Esther, was a teenager, and was really thrown for a loop when I realized she had a 30-something daughter. Most of the characters continue in that vein - they act so extremely immature, it's hard to like any of them. The book begins with Ester receiving a letter from her mother, and even though she's ignored her mother's repeated pleadings to come home in the past, this time she decides to go home, admit the truth to her daughter, and drag Holly along. And so begins a novel of whining, lies, more lies, and more whining. Ester's obsession about the past, and blaming herself for things that were out of her control and not her fault, really drove me crazy. I get obsessing - being rather an obsesser myself - but at some point you have to say to yourself to suck it up and move on, and that doesn't happen in the course of this book.And of course in the end, there's a happily ever after, though little is actually resolved. Yet, despite all of that, I did really enjoy the book and was glad to have the next book in the series at hand, ready to read.I picked up this book to read for free on amazon, and read it as part of the Pennsylvania Patchwork book tour."}, {"userName": "Betty", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5168156-betty", "userReview": "This is the first book in the Legacy of Lancaster Trilogy. Holly Fisher, 37, is the main character. She lives with her widowed mother, Ester, in Seattle. Holly never met her father as he died before she was born. She has always wanted a family, but it has always been just she and her mother. Holly has recently been told by her boss that due to the economy he has to let her go. She had loved her job and now is anxious to find another. Money has always been tight for Holly and her mother.  Ester receives a letter from her mother stating that she is very ill and probably won't live much longer. She is begging Ester to come home to Lancaster so she can see her one more time before she dies. Ester knows she must go, but that means she will have to tell Holly that there is family in Lancaster that Ester has never told Holly about. She has also never shared their Amish traditions with Holly either. Ester knows that they must go but she fears what this will do to her relationship with her daughter. The book is well written with strong and likable characters. The plot line pulls you along as you learn about Holly, her mother and their large Amish family and all the secrets that Holly is uncovering.

The point of view switches often between Holly and Esther, as every chapter is told in the first person voice of one of them. This took a very short time to get used to, but was a very effective way to make me feel I understood the feelings and viewpoints of both characters. Grief, coming to terms with disappointments and losses in our lives, teenage rebellion, and the power of forgiveness are dealt with very well,but there seemed to be many questions left unanswered at the end of the book. I am, therefore, hoping there is a sequel. I understand why Holly and Esther's relationship is portrayed as it is, and it does seem very realistic considering the circumstances, but am hoping they grow and get beyond their differences even more. I am grateful that the author sent me this book as a giveaway prize, but I was in no way required to write a positive review.

The premise interested me because the estranged family who was left behind was Amish, and the main character Esther had to work through a lot in order to move on with her life. While I enjoyed the story, I didn't love the main character (Esther) or her daughter Holly. They were not nice people. That said, all the supporting characters were wonderful. This kept me reading. Throughout the story I tried connecting why Esther was so mad at everyone, and why she became estranged in the first place. While I think I've come up with a reason I'm not convinced it's \"good enough\" to warrant all the years of separation and guilt. Perhaps this is true to real life though.

Her book combined all I love about the Amish lifestyle and traditions and showed me Biblical truths about deception (and its consequences) and why we need to show forgiveness toward not just others but also ourselves. Anyone who is a female realizes that mother-daughter relationships can be challenging at times. Ms. Lloyd does a great job taking those complications and adding additional pressure such as stubbornness, deception, lies, and guilt. She broadens the scope of those feelings by including multi-generations, showing how our actions not only affect ourselves but also our children, parents, and other relatives. I love how God will take Biblical truths and reveal them to me in various ways. While I was reading this book, my church was in the middle of a sermon series which discussed that very theme. When we sin, it affects multi-generations, not just us. When we choose to make the right choice, multi-generations are blessed. And, let\u2019s not forget the most important truth: When we confess and turn away from our sin to obedience, God rewards those choices with blessings. I love how Ms. Lloyd answered the central questions in this book, but left it open-ended. I can\u2019t wait to read the next book in the series, Pennsylvania Patchwork. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what happens with Holly, her mother Esther, and her grandmother \u201cMommy Anna.\u201d I was challenged as a parent and a person to live a life of obedience so that future generations in my genealogical line will receive blessings rather than consequences of any sin I would commit. As a parent, you want the best for your children and it\u2019s encouraging to know that through my actions and attitudes and choices, I\u2019m leaving a legacy for them\u2026and I can choose if it\u2019s positive or negative. Thank you, Ms. Lloyd, for reminding me of the above truth as well as that forgiveness is a gift to be extended to all, not just for the one who committed the sin but also for yourself if you have sinned. It\u2019s definitely harder to forgive ourselves when we fail than to extend that forgiveness to another. But God doesn\u2019t want us to live in condemnation, especially self condemnation. He wants to set us free when we choose obedience. We will still have to live with the consequences of our actions at times, but God has so much more in store for us than living a life wrapped in self guilt.I\u2019m looking forward to reading the next book in the series to see what Biblical truths Ms. Lloyd is going to share next, all while surrounded in a great story with lots of twists and turns."}, {"userName": "Kathleen (Kat) Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328680-kathleen-kat-smith", "userReview": "When Esther Gingerich left her Amish community in Lancaster, PA during her rumspringa, with the love of her life Samuel Fisher, the rest of their family expected them to return.

In this case, Samuel would be drafted into the Vietnam War and would never be found again. He would remain forever Missing in Action, just like Esther and Samuel did when they left their families.Now many years later, Esther receives word from her ailing mother, Anna to return home to help take care of her before the rest of the family sells the farm and moves to Montana to begin a new life all over again. If Esther can only find a way to tell her daughter, Holly, that everything she has believed up to this point has been a complete lie. How funny that she would fail to tell her about her Amish upbringing while running an Amish Shoppe? Or that her grandmother is still living when she was told she was dead? How can she ever find a way to return home and expect Holly to come with her?In the novel, Leaving Lancaster by Kate Lloyd, Esther has to find a way to return home and face up to the past she's not only been lying about, but also running away from. Holly has a right to get to know the family she has hidden from her including many grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. But will it be as easy as believing that the Amish are so easy to forgive her, or will there be no place for Esther and Holly to return to. Just how sick is her mother anyway and why does she want them to come home now? This is truly a story about forgiveness and what the seeds of bitterness will grow if we allow them to continue uninterrupted in our lives. It is a wonderful story of starting new chapters in our lives and learning the importance of family, of putting aside grudges and accepting forgiveness.I received Leaving Lancaster by Kate Lloyd compliments of David C Cook Publishers and Net Galley for my honest review. Too often we can't see beyond our anger and resentment to see what we are missing if we are willing to let go and forgive. This novel does the perfect job at that through the alternating chapters that Esther and Holly share in this Amish fiction, conveying for the reader just what each of them in going through as they work towards resolving their own issues.

Esther's father died in a buggy accident shortly after they left Lancaster but Esther didn't find out about it until it was too late to return for his funeral, so once she left, she never saw her father again.Esther and her mother have kept in touch sporadically throughout the years, but Holly didn't know because the letters were always sent to Doris's address, the friend that helped Esther move to Seattle. Esther never shared the letters until Anna, her mother, wrote telling her that she was ill and the whole family, Anna, Esther's five brothers and their families, were thinking about moving to Montana.After finding that out she decided it was time she told Holly about the large family she had yet to meet. It did not go over well, Holly didn't believe her at first but since she had just been laid off from her job, she 'called her mother's bluff' by making plans for both of them to fly to PA and see just what was what. Holly and Esther both had second thoughts several times within the few days before they took off, but they did go.It gets very interesting once they arrive and I will not spoil any of that for you. I will say that I really enjoyed this book, I had a hard time putting it down. I think anyone that invests their money in purchasing the book and their time in reading it will be thankful they did.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this e-book free from the publisher through NetGalley  book review program.

This was clean read not swearing or sex scenes. Deals with real problems. Esther Fisher gets a letter from her mother whom she has not seen since she was 16, when her and Samuel ran away from home. Her mother is in her 80's and wants to see her. Esther needs to tell her daughter the truth she has hidden for all these years. Holly Samantha Fisher at 37 has just lost her job. Holly has never married. Esther tells Holly that her grandmother is still alive with her uncles and family. Esther wants Holly to travel with her from Seattle Washington back to her Amish relatives in Lancaster. Holly can not believe her that her mother has been hiding that her relatives were alive. She wonders at what other lies her mother has told her. Did her dad really die during Viatnam. Esther runs an Amish goods store in Seattle, but she buys her products mostly from Ohio not the area she grew up on. Esther has raised Holly all by herself. She was born after Samuel went MIA. She feels guilty for the death of her husband because if they would have stayed and been baptised than he would not have been drafted. Holly finally agrees to fly with her mom to Lancaster and meet all the relatives she did not know she had. She always wanted a grandmother. When they are in a rental car Holly finds out her grandmother has no idea that they are coming. Her grandmother does not have a phone but her menonite neighbor does so they call her and she invites them to stay the night with her. Holly feels really close to Beth and meets her single son who is a vet. Zach. Esther has been jealous of Beth and Beth has had bitter feelings toward Esther . Grandma Anna is so glad that they have come especially when in a little while the whole family is going to move to Montana to buy land. They have sold this farm if they accept the offer. It shows you a slim glimmer of what life is with Amish. Deals more with issues of family and thier secrets, forgiveness, love Christ. Just dealing with regular family problems that come up in life.

Esther was raised Amish, but left with her husband, Samuel during the sixties. Now, many years later she goes back, with her bitter daughter in tow, to face the past she thought she'd left behind.What will Holly and Esther find among the Amish of Lancaster County?As I said above, this book has a very interesting way of telling this story from the points of view of Esther and Holly, with Esther's side being told in third-person, and Holly's side in first-person. The switching narratives gave an different and somewhat refreshing way of telling a story. Though the book was well written, I found myself often struggling to get the motivation to pick it up again. The reason was that I found the characters were constantly negative thinkers, and most of the book dwelt on Esther and Holly's bitterness toward each other and those around them, as well as the hostility of their long-lost relatives. And this is my personal opinion, but I think that having Holly tell her story in first person just didn't work for me, I cringed often at unkind thoughts she had toward her mother for a large majority of the book, and so I wish that I had not had such an intimate look at the inside of her head. I really liked the fresh tilt of the story, but as a person who doesn't like conflict in real life, this book was just not something I could enjoy. I think alot of other people would like this book, but the constant bitterness, and grudge-holding that made up a majority of this book was just too much for me. I can't tell you the end of this story, but this book does end on a happy, hopeful note :) Oh, and I really liked the Vietnam war backstory!Overall I would say that alot of the reasons why I didn't like this book were basically my personal opinion, and I think that many others could find pleasure between it's pages.I received this book from the publisher through Netgalley in return for an honest review.

In Leaving Lancaster, the main character, Esther left her Amish roots with her intended and didn't return until a letter from her mom begs her to return. Now, over 30 years later, Esther then tells her daughter that she has extended family in Pennsylvania - something she has desired since her childhood. At this point in the book, neither character seems to act their age. Both are presented with behaviors similar to teenagers bickering. Also, throughout the novel, I had to reread sections to make sure I knew who was talking or was part of the action.I enjoyed the book's storyline as the returning prodigal daughter returns and is accepting into the family / community. But the writing style and under-developed characters won't have me going back for more. Leaving Lancaster does not have a neat and tidy ending, so I feel there will be at least one more book with these same characters.I received a complimentary ebook from David C.

Not just any family, but hundreds of cousins, aunts, uncles, and even a grandmother - in the heart of Lancaster County. Lloyd does an excellent job of conveying the vast array of emotions with the three main characters and gives us a unique glimpse of what actions and consequences have cost three generations of women. Holly has the least blame in everything, but she still stubbornly holds on to anger and resentment at her mother for withholding knowledge of her family's whereabouts. Now for the one thing that drove me nuts about Holly. Oh, she shaped up and turned out to be a great lead character, but her behavior in the beginning was absolutely terrible. I could hardly believe that any adult would act the way she did. I was very happy to see a change of attitude, and she did a complete 180 in the course of the book. Her entire viewpoint drastically changes and she becomes the woman she was meant to become. Lloyd writes with an above stellar perspective on love, relationships and what it means to truly be a family.
