It is a story that will sound vaguely familiar: a girl grows up in a small town, with its small town locales (laundromat, shipyard, shabby houses), its small town occupations (primarily drinking), and its small town tragedies (men lost at sea). In this setting, the unnamed narrator longs to escape her dreary existence as a seasonal worker in the sardine factory and sometime chambermaid at a rundown motel called the Seas. The twist is that this heroine believes she is a mermaid.This part of the story should sound familiar, too: a young woman, who is secretly a mermaid, lives on land and falls in love with a sailor. In this case, the young woman's father once told her she was a mermaid, and later walked into the sea, never to be seen again. And the sailor, Jude, is a veteran of the Gulf War and thirteen years older than the young woman. What makes Hunt's novel particularly compelling, is the narrative voice. Unlike a fairy tale, this story is told in a clear, unfaltering, and totally unreliable first person. The narrator spins a tale full of strange scientific findings, arcane nautical history, poetic delusions, and obsessive love. The setting provides the perfect foggy, ethereal atmosphere for the heroine, who lives in a crooked old house with her mother and paternal grandfather, both of whom are in various stages of grief over the losses of their spouses.Like Hans Christian's Andersen's The Little Mermaid, the heroine of Hunt's novel struggles to communicate with those around her -- though not because she is mute. Her difficulty has more to do with her inability to process her father's suicide. In fact, all the characters of The Seas have problems expressing their feelings, and this inability to tell the tale, as it were, manifests itself in a preoccupation with words and their various meanings. Throughout the novel Hunt explores the ways in which language evades, escapes, or fails the characters. This aspect of the novel, which includes occasional dictionary entries, could come off as precious, but Hunt executes it with precision and grace. Each character has a different sort of preoccupation with language, and in a novel in which almost everyone is \"stuck\" physically and emotionally, their fixations become charming idiosyncrasies.The grandfather is a particularly interesting character. A former typesetter who wooed his wife by sending her backwards love notes in trays of type, he has been setting the type of his own personal dictionary for years. In one passage he asks the narrator, her mother, and Jude about the Russian word razbliuto. \"We don't have a word to match it but we should. We should develop it tonight because the word means, 'the feelings one retains for someone he once loved.'\" \"Hate?\" Jude says. \"No, not that feeling,\" my grandfather answers and looks at Jude with disappointment. \"Betrayal,\" my mother says without looking away from her book. \"No,\" my grandfather says. \"It's the little house love moved out of, maybe a hermit crab moves in and carries the house across the floor of the tidal pool. The lover sees the old love moving and it looks like it's alive again.\"The magic of this story is in the lines like the grandfather's. A word is lost, or hasn't come into being yet, and in its place is a whole narrative that endeavors to express it. The mother and grandfather both hold onto feelings for their lost loves, and just as they have no word in their language equivalent to razbliuto, they have no words for the losses they feel.Hunt's characters are so jammed up with stories -- losses they need to express and grieve -- that words physically manifest around them. Jude first meets the narrator at the beach when they are both looking for something in the water. \"We watched the water between us rushing back out to sea and I swear I saw the ocean fill up with words, like Jude was bleeding all the things he couldn't tell anyone because it might kill him.\" Jude finally does tell his story, but I won't ruin the surprise: suffice it to say that a war in the desert is a shocking, but not unwelcome, addition to this dark, watery novel.The narrator, too, is afraid of what speaking her story might do to her. Instead of facing the fact of her father's suicide, she creates the mermaid narrative to give order to her unmanageable grief. An outcast in the depressed, alcoholic town, her secret, mythical identity explains her feelings of difference and alienation. Hunt never names the narrator, as if she were a character so foreign that it takes a whole story to figure out who she is. But to readers, she is an uncannily familiar character, and her tale is as intoxicating as a siren song."}, {"userName": "Stephen P", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11602286-stephen-p", "userReview": "What is it that makes a book work? Fall apart?The Seas captured a first person narrative voice of a young woman, sensitive and imaginative, whose voice soared. Abandoned in a wintry deaden northern town, her father walked into the sea. Didn\u2019t return. What she knows is what her mother knows, they cannot leave until her father returns. They must wait. She is obsessed with a man fourteen years older than her who remains a companion but does not return the girl-woman\u2019s passion. All others mock her for her estrangement creating further estrangement. I loved the debut novel\u2019s lack of polish with its crags and occasional jagged edge. So difficult to close the covers.There are times that readers are called away from books no matter what the zen discipline, by bodily needs not screaming but with a curt authority making its unwavered demands known. Inserting the blue book marker in its place, laying the book on the table next to my chair I patted the cover and vanished. Moments later I returned to my chair and opened the book. What? Who\u2026Who took over the writing? The dog? She\u2019s still sleeping on the couch. Besides, she only like translations. Same book, same author, same book marker and page, oh so near the much anticipated end. The ending ties everything together. Peeking under the chair I couldn\u2019t find the neat package. All of the suspenseful sentences, driving the narrative forward was nothing but a lame story strung together to reach this pallid end. Sure there was disappointment after so much promise but what was glaringly there was anger. I felt I had been used, played, and yeah I felt foolish. A set up. A set up in reverse where a flourish of brilliant color is swathed across the canvas only to lead to the surprise of a letdown. In the end a wonderfully written style in a poorly written book.Hey, it\u2019s a debut novel. Hunt can write. My hope is that she moves or has moved past this amateurish flaw and sees the need to pour her soaring style into a well honed overall structure."}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/622520-nick", "userReview": "I really liked this novel.

That was eleven years ago. He hasn\u2019t come back though and even though the police found the place on the beach where my father\u2019s footprints disappeared into the water they never found his body. So my mother and I have been waiting. We often sit and wait on the beach just where my father\u2019s footprints disappeared into the water. Sometimes I wait alone. We always thought he would return\u2026\u201dThe unnamed narrator lives with her mother and her grandfather in a seaside town. A bleak seaside town set against steep cliffs. A town that feels like a prison.She\u2019s still at school, dreaming of becoming a scientist and making a little pocket-money as a chambermaid. And she loves, to the point of obsession, a sailor nearly twice her age, Jude. She loved him before he left for Iraq, she waited, and she still loved him now that he has returned with Post Traumatic Stress. Jude is a down at heel, womanizing alcoholic, but he still keeps her close. But not too close.At home her mother waits for her husband, still married in both heart and head. And her grandfather, her mother\u2019s father, a retired typesetter, spends his days planning and typesetting dictionaries that will never be published, and filling his granddaughter\u2019s head with wonderful wordsAnd the girl, whose departed father told her that she was a gift from the sea is drawn to the water.I\u2019d lie down in the tub instead of my bed. At first my mother would wake me up and make me move back into my bed but after years and years she finally gave up and let me sleep there. I liked it in the tub because from the window I could see the stars and the ocean and sometimes, if it was calm, I could see the stars in the ocean. I liked the tub. If I slept with my ear against the drainpipe I could hear my parents\u2019 conversations at night, long metallic talking that made its way up through the plumbing.Samantha Hunt presents all of this beautifully. Her prose is light, lyrical, idiosyncratic and quite wonderfully awash with watery imagery. The melancholy of the isolated seaside town is tangible. Her characters are lightly and perfectly drawn and each one \u2013 from the lonely girl believes she will become a mermaid to the troubled veteran who can\u2019t find his place in his hometown \u2013 has their own distinctive voice, their own role to play.As obsessive love and the call of the ocean push the gentle storyline to a dramatic turn. It pulls all of the strands of the story together very, very cleverly, but for me the writing lost something at that point, and the magic never quite came back as the story rushed to an ending that I didn\u2019t think quite worked.There is considerable magic in the pages of this little book, wonderful ideas, wonderful emotions. It\u2019s just that Samantha Hunt couldn\u2019t quite pull off everything at the same time, couldn\u2019t quite see things through to the end.But such potential \u2026 maybe one day \u2026"}, {"userName": "Tze-Wen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60762-tze-wen", "userReview": "Apparently, living out harsh lives in the small town leads to excessive alcohol-consumption and depression, and poor Jude is no exception to the rule. If you're not trying to escape reality by drinking, you have to immerse yourself in other pastimes. The girl's mother, who grew up on an island with mostly deaf people, loves contemplating in silence. The protagonist's grandfather enjoys perusing dictionaries and finding the origin of and connections between words. And in a way, both of them find safety and comfort in hoarding. The girl herself takes on jobs whenever work comes available and is obsessed about the sea, Jude, her mermaid nature, and her father who might come back from the sea and kill Jude. Overall, I found this a difficult book to like. The young heroine of the story is just so detached from the world around her, displaced on \"the dry land\" as she calls it, to the point that I strongly suspected she had a psychological problem or an intellectual disability; Scientology does not equal science nor does drinking bath water turn you into a mermaid. Other reviews have claimed that she, unable to cope with the grief of losing her father, fashioned the mermaid-story so she could go on living. I, however, remain skeptical, and think more is amiss with her.Her narrative weaves in and out of reality as we know it and made it hard for me to follow what was really happening. I think that this irked me the most: in my opinion this isn't fiction bordering on fantasy, this is fiction being indecisive about being either fantasy or a story about a girl who needs some serious psychological help. I am convinced I would have liked either of those better than the shape The Seas has been given now.Finally, the blurb on the back of the book read \"what she does to ease the pain of growing up lands her in prison\" and \"what she does to get out is the stuff of legends\". Perhaps the way she experienced both events was a bit surreal, but what really happened was actually quite ordinary.

The narrator is unreliable - a bereaved and troubled young woman in love with a damaged Iraq War vet. At times it is a bit heavy-handed with the imagery but there are many rich and artful moments. And yet it seems to me that it doesn't flow as it might. It is uneven. Beautiful nuggets everywhere, but like confetti, or trying to drink fog. A case of water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink. For the first half or more, anyway. The last third drinks like a good draught of something bracing like whisky or seawater but, as those go too, the end effect is a sort of dreaminess. Something has happened, I am glad I read the book, I am glad it's entered my brain and I won't readily forget its flavor but it was uneven and that took me fatally out of full immersion in it sometimes, especially in the first half, when I was aware tension was supposed to be being built. If you like stark, haunting, Gothic (although even the scent of that is overplayed with the grandfather noting the typeface in which her hospital records were recorded as \"Franklin Gothic\". But it could be argued you cannot overplay Gothic) and creepy stories drenched in Northern seawater this will be right up your creek. Bring an extra paddle though for those few moments in which the narrative gets choppy and you think you'll jump ship. (Sheesh.

She believes now he was telling her they were from the ocean, and she awaits his return:\"People often suggest that it would be better if we knew for certain whether or not my father is dead rather than just disappeared. That to me seems cruel, as if they want me to abandon all hope. That is how dreary people try to keep things here on dry land.Despite them, I remain hopeful. Even though the way I remember my father and these things he once said is becoming more and more like the way a page of paper yellows with time or the way a dream slips ahead of the waking dreamer or the way people get hard-skinned with age and use that hard skin like a file to toughen up their children. Am I mermaid? I once was certain. But now the older I get, the vaguer things become.\"She loves a man named Jude, and Iraq war veteran who is fourteen years older than she is, but although Jude cares for her he does not return her romantic feelings. The thing about this book, about Hunt\u2019s writing, is that she normalizes the fantastical. The narrator\u2014who is isolated and lonely, with no friends her own age\u2014for a good portion of the story seems simply quirky and na\u00efve, a young woman who has held on too long to childhood because she\u2019s unsure how to become an adult, especially in a place with so few opportunities for her, so few models to follow. With little else to occupy her time, she thinks about Jude. She follows him around town. The shifts are subtle. She\u2019s quirky. And then maybe she\u2019s depressed. And then when things take a turn the full reality becomes apparent to the reader, who is maybe just invested enough to wonder: what part is real, and what part is a fantasy? In hindsight, everything seems clear. But in the telling, not so much. Hunt has said she wrote The Seas originally as a book of poems. She said in a Powell\u2019s interview, \u201cI learned to write by hanging out with poets, and I've never abandoned the idea that every word should be handled and adored. Making the world from 26 letters is my delight.\u201d I love that so much: every word should be handled and adored. What a difference that is from taking words, shoving them into cheap, shiny gowns, painting their faces, and then pushing them onto a stage and forcing them to perform.When I finished The Seas, overall I thought it was pretty good for a debut novel. But in the few days since I finished it, and then sitting down to write this post, I am starting to realize just how well-crafted this novel really is. When I was about two-thirds through the novel, I had written in my notebook, \u201cFever dream?\u201d But by the end I realized that was wrong. Hunt has clear empathy for the narrator. I suppose what I mean is this: the best stories about madness show us that madness isn\u2019t really absence of reason; it\u2019s just that the reasons don\u2019t make sense to the outside world.

The alchemist Paracelsus (1493-1521) theorized that Ondines were elemental water nymphs. According to legends, Ondines (or Undines) had no souls unless they married mortal men. Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9 drew upon these legends in his highly popular German novel \"Undine\" (1811) as did Hans Christian Anderson in his classic \"The Little Mermaid\" (1837).In \"The Seas,\" a nineteen-year-old protagonist whose name we never know is convinced to a certainty that she is a mermaid because her father told her so before he disappeared at sea years ago. She falls in love with a shell-shocked veteran almost twice her age who drinks and hides from his war experiences. Jude, however, is the only person in this despairing, northern coastal fishing and tourist town who cares for her. Like everyone else in town, Jude and the prospective mermaid are trapped in a life where alcoholism, boredom and a bit of fishing are the primary pursuits.As the prologue explains, \"If you were to try to leave, people who have known you since the day you were born would recognize your car and see you leaving. They would wonder where you were going and they would wave with two fingers off the steering wheel, a wave that might seem like a stop sign or a warning to someone trying to forget this very small town. It would be much easier to stay.\"She has few social skills, is viewed as deeply disturbed, if not retarded, by everyone else in town including her own mother who waits, and will probably always be waiting, for the return of her husband. Our young protagonist, who narrates her own story and--it appears--believes that we (as readers) are understanding and humane enough to be taken into her confidence, knows the mermaid legends. She fears her love will end up killing Jude.\"The Seas\" is awash with water, with bleak satire and bleaker images. The writing is lyrical and precise, blending reality and fable in a way that blurs the littoral zone where the sea and the land meet, where reality and fairytale collide, where sanity and obsession become twisted together. If \"The Seas\" has failings--other than being darker than we can bear--it's the occasional overly robust presentation of the author's and/or the main character's anti-war and society-without-pity themes.Our narrator wants to return to the sea.

I was drawn to this book because I liked Hunt's contribution to Tin House's Fantastic Women issue, a short story entitled \"Beast.\" I spent the first hundred pages of The Seas wishing she had stuck to the shorter format--it is repetitive in a way that is not especially lyrical or insightful but just gives the feeling that she didn't have enough ideas for sustained novel. But then she threw in the story about the narrator being furniture for a ship's captain. And Jude's confession about his time in Iraq and the wolf-boy and the ziggurat. A ziggurat! And then Jude melted! Fuck yeah! I hope these meatier images and anecdotes will coalesce in some beautiful way.2.

Oh, her mother grew up on an island full of deaf people, and her grandfather is a typesetter. Well, fabulous. Maybe I just need to pay more Attention so I can Understand Better. I do enjoy all the visceral images of ears in the book, notably when the mother tries to catch deafness by pressing her ear to her friend's, and when the heroine finally tastes Jude's earwax. Mmm. 3. This book is clearly inspired by two songs I loved as an adolescent, which are good songs but probably inspire a lot of girls did who grow up to write novels based on fairy tales, which is endearing but potentially trite.

Not this time around, that is, but it took me only one night (roughtly 4 hours) to read it the first time. I really, really, love this book. It is highly surreal and weird in a rough way, it contains a strange imaginary and it challenges me to accept all of the narrators perceptions as real. I am inclined to do so anyway.The seas is a novel about a girl who believes that she is a mermaid. It might also be a novel about a girl who IS a mermaid. This really depends on one's own point of view. I know, people might argue that she is just mentally ill, that she is seeing things. The protagonist - I wish I could tell you her name but the truth is I'm not sure if it is ever mentioned - is definitely seeing things. She is experiencing severe hallucinations which are identified as such, but however that doesn't necessarily mean that she is not a mermaid.The book is not for everyone. It does contain suicidal behavior and might be triggering to people who are struggling with unrealism, there is a wee bit of slut shaming too and I'm p sure the way how they talk about deaf people is quite insensitive. Nevertheless it is a book that I quite enjoyed reading because it is an interesting experience. I don't quite understand this book. I don't feel pressured too and it doesn't make me mad.

Folk stories mixing with modern life, magical realism mixing with fantasy (which is it?), clinical insanity mixed with the \"normal\" insanity of which everyone has their own peculiar brand.This is the story of a teenager, living in a rundown, and her attempts to have a relationship with an older man who just wants to be friends. Years ago, her father walked into the ocean, and never came back - which of course means that the two of them are mermaids, because he couldn't be dead. This shapes the way she sees the world: she can't wait for global warming to melt the ice caps and send everyone who has been cruel to her into the depths; she knows the stories about mermaids who must kill the mortal men who don't return their love, and she's terrified that she will have to kill the man she loves. All this is told a stream-of-consciousness style, where the past pervades the present and words can have many meanings.

The cryptic way the girl sees her world erodes the barrier of communication between her mother and the love they have for men that hold them to the town. Metaphor plays a large part in the sensory details of this seaside town\u2019s story. Image and feelings, rather than factual truths, allow us to see the suicide of her father and her relationship with a man named Jude in a different light. To the world, the girl\u2019s father committed suicide. The town believes Jude is just a drunk veteran back from Iraq. Yet we are shown little details that make the unbelievable possible. Even the girls name is never really revealed. Using the visibility of discourse, we gather evidence on what is actually the truth by comparing everyday language with metaphors that are composed of codes. As an example, we learn that the girl\u2019s mother works with sign language. The words form hand signals that convey meanings by the way she shapes her hands. Signing has literal meanings. Thus, we begin to learn little details that slowly build on the metaphors the girl gives us. We learn that Jude is keeping some information from the girl. We know that it concerns Iraq, but we also know that it might be something more. She describes meeting Jude without telling him her name. Then she uses the metaphor of Jude bleeding words into the ocean because he has information he can\u2019t tell anyone. Jude\u2019s relationship with the girl is hindered by age and something else. The girl mentions the conversation they overhear. \u201cPlease, I\u2019m telling you love is a broken-down old car by the side of the road and sometimes you have to rig a fan belt or an alternator with what you got.\u201d (Hunt, 14)  We wonder why Jude sleeps with the other women in the town, but not with the girl who loves him. The girl throws herself at Jude. He backs up. He looks scared. Author Samantha Hunt has the girl describe an analogy of wanting Jude so bad that she is giving birth to him. She relates to how babyish he seems in the way he drinks. Since she wants him so bad, she opts for him inside her head as an alternative to sex. After Jude gets drunk he relates some cryptic information about the scars on his ribs. \u201cThose cuts on my ribs are because I am trying to open gills before the flood comes.\u201d (Hunt, 30) The act of Jude\u2019s gill cutting is mentioned again. Finally on the beach near the salt marsh she describes the scars as looking like someone attempted to write him a message, but then scribbled letters instead. In a metaphor Jude is described like snow white.  The letter left by Jude in the prologue becomes an important piece to the puzzle. He becomes a metaphor like the stories he tells the girl about the world. The author stretches the notion of a story being like a metaphor: [ One night , In a storm so beautiful , I considered jumping overboard, and those are all the stories I like to hear. He tells them and he makes the world seem enormous, like the stories are a torch he is shoving into the dark corners pushing the perimeters back farther and farther.] (Hunt, 60) Jude becomes like a burning fire to the girl\u2019s desire. When she finally touches him sexually, he melts before her eyes. The police arrest her for suspicion of murder. The letter from Jude that began in the prologue is finally opened. It tells of his jumping overboard and her father rescuing him by making Jude promise not to marry her. Her mother comes to visit her. The mother is still not convinced of her being a mermaid. She asks the girl what her defense is. The girl tells her that she didn\u2019t kill Jude. She wants her mother to her dad that she is in prison, but the mother says he is dead. The girl makes it clear that her dad is only dead on land. Her mother still isn\u2019t convinced. So the girl tells her the whole story. Even about the letter from Jude and his torso made of ice. There are beautiful moments in the prison. Samantha Hunt allows the information from the walls to slowly build a possible truth of the girl\u2019s reality. The communication through the walls are metaphors, like letters forming sign language. The girl listens to the sounds coming from the walls. They are prisoners who want to hear her story. The women prisoners go silent at the end of her tale. They say it is very romantic. They confide in her that she must be a mermaid, an Undine. Then the drips of water are linking her to her dad. She try\u2019s to send him a message. The next day she finds wet footprints and her jail cell unlocked. When she gets out of the prison her mother tells her they found a suicide note, but the mother tells her that isn\u2019t how the story ends. The girl smiles and tells her mother that instead of using words she should use sign language. She sees her mother\u2019s sign language as something that means ocean. The formula of using visibility as discourse decodes their previous difficulties of understanding. Her mother begins signing: [\u201cShe bobs up and down like a fish, while her fingers spread out words like the spray from the waves hitting a ship. Words are precise. Just is a word. Just seems more like a moth passing through and once it is gone she\u2019ll believe that Jude and my father are alive. ] (Hunt, 187)  I have learned from reading the book that details make a story more believable. \u201cI tell her details. Details make a story even as unbelievable as mine believable.\u201d (Hunt, 187) The author explains through her use of metaphors that words can have more than one meaning. The mystic is visualized with the right words. Words must be rearranged like atoms in the Genome sequence. Only then can we discover we all share this mysterious life. Life has only to be deciphered. Like Aristotle\u2019s paradigmatic proportional scale. A is to B as C is to D. [\u201cI think it is like chemistry. Like the letters are atom, the words are molecules, and the sentences are elements. You just chose the scale you want to see the world in.\u201d] (Hunt, 190)  Works CitedHunt, Samantha.

Madness and fantasy lurk at every turn. I read it in one sitting, transfixed from the first page, falling deeper under the spell of Samantha Hunt\u2019s lyrical style.The story is of an unnamed narrator in a bleak seaside town. Her father walked into the water one day and never came back. She is in unrequited love with an older, brooding war veteran, and she believes she is a mermaid, doomed to murder the one she loves and return to her father in the ocean.The narrator descends into her fantasy and the author builds the illusion with beautiful stretches of ocean imagery, carrying the characters through to the end where reality has become completely irrelevant and the only thread to follow is the current of obsession, love, and grief.This book is certainly not for everyone. But I loved it. I want to read it again, and again, and again, the heart of this story beating on in my chest, waves tolling ceaselessly against the rocks."}, {"userName": "MysteriousPanda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21899-mysteriouspanda", "userReview": "The Seas is a coming of age novel that has a dream like quality to it. Sometimes it feels like we are experiencing the text in a manner quite like the narrator experiences life. We cannot tell what is real and what is fantasy, each blurring seamlessly into the other.The tone throughout the book was one of tragedy and loss in a small seaside town where alcoholism is a hobby and there seems to be no future readily available. The narrator is a young girl of nineteen who believes she is a mermaid. She is in love with an older man who is a war veteran and she believes she will bring about his death. I read this novel not expecting it to be so fantastical.
