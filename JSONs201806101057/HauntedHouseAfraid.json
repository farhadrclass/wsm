Years ago I became a HUGE fan of Konrath when he was putting out complexly plotted books, that were perfectly edited and interacting with fans. Now that he has gotten rich that quality has disappeared (the last 3 releases have been wanting in quality). This book had a number of errors. First, were the NUMEROUS editing errors of wrong word usage, misspelling, and more than once using the wrong character name! Second, was lack of character development. Okay so, many of the characters were stars from previous books. In this book they open as fearful and weak and all displaying the same traits. Then there is no progression or development until 80+ % into the book they suddenly all at the same time, with no interaction with each other, change personality 180\u00b0 and give up so they have no fear. Third, the plot has problems. The beginning was disjointed bouncing around between nine different people's POV. Made it hard to stay focused. Then later in the book you'd get scenes saying one character's name when it was obviously a different character. Fourth, the reveal had to be explained. Meaning the only clue was one line of dialog in the first part of the book by a secondary character and then suddenly at the end a character TELLS how he figured it out. Fifth, it was suppose to be scary. Anticipatory fear was sadly missing from this book. All you had was gruesome things popping out around each and every corner. It was too over the top to be believed. I'm sure you've all seen those squeal #8 horror movies where it is startling monsters that jump out are the only scares. That's what this was like.The epilogue pages regarding F* & B* were excellent. Unfortunately given the declining quality in the last three books...as much as I want to read Origin #2, the next Chandler, and the next Jack Daniel books I'm NO LONGER comfortable with them being an automatic buy. I'll wait for a copy from the library, because it is clear this author needs to get his head back in the game and plot and EDIT the stories he should show us. 2.5/5 stars(less)"}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4291082-peter", "userReview": "Eight people were selected to take part in a fear experiment at the old Butler House.

There were some frightening situations and I did enjoy the turn the story took near the end, but it seemed to have lost some steam and my interest in the last several chapters. The ending does make me want to re-read Kilborn's fantastic Origin. It was a fun, gory book, though and I enjoyed catching up with the characters.***I'm about 1/4 of the way through this, and it starts off with a bang and is holding my interest very steady; tried fighting sleep last night to keep reading. Not sure how cliche it will turn once they're in the haunted house as haunted house stories are wont to do, but the introduction of the characters is done well with some creepy, throwaway descriptions that caught me off guard.

The concept of the story is promising: the survivors of horrors in his other book are gathered to a haunted house for a study on fear, something they are all intimately acquainted with. But the clunky prose, perfunctory story-telling, and clumsy execution fails to bring the story to the level of its concept.The pacing and proportion of the story's action to its introduction is strange, with the first half of the book being devoted to setting up the story and its characters, and the last half with a very choppy series of events that comprise the haunted house portion of the story. Unfortunately, neither part was done very well, so the story is ultimately unsatisfying.An inordinate amount of time is spent introducing the characters and their backstories, without actually providing any insight into any of them, other than that they are survivors of some horrific incidents, but they suffer constant fear and anxiety because of it. There is little to bring a reader to care for them, other than sympathy, because the characters are nothing but survivors with PTSD. It's difficult to difficult to differentiate between them, except by the path their fear has led them to take. Kilborn helpfully included links to brief synopses of their origin stories, and this is the only way I could've remembered who was who. While this was a great feature, it would have been far more effective to actually take some time on the characterization and condensing the \"invitation and travel\" sequences.Once the characters are introduced, have dithered about their responses to the invitation, and have serendipitously met and bonded along the way, everyone arrives at the haunted house. At last. A few new characters are introduced - the psychic, the ghost-hunter, and the skeptic - and their introductions are so perfunctory, they might as well have shirts on with \"Cannon-fodder or Conspirators? Tune in and find out!\" on them. Yes, it's that obvious. I don't even think it should qualify as a spoiler, since the author didn't even have the time to pretend they matter. Most authors at least try to give some cagey POV moments with this type of character, to keep you guessing.The ghosts haunting the home are introduced, but there are so many of them, and they're all blandly awful. Again, it would be difficult to differentiate them, except Kilborn helpfully provides us with details that set them apart: one giggles, one smells, etc. But really, they're just generic psychopathic assholes with deep masochistic streaks.The action begins, and it's a rat-a-tat-tat drive-by of gore, confusion, and POV-hopping. While rapidly shuttling between scenes and POV can be an excellent technique for ratcheting up the tension, here it seems more intended to convince the reader that things are terrifying, when it's really just difficult to care about their fates at all. The gore and violence seems to just happen, and except for two storylines - one involving a black mass, the other involving a monkey - they aren't particularly interesting. Gore has its place in horror, but this was just sad and unhorrifying.Since the structure of the story is clearly based on Shirley Jackson's \"The Haunting of Hill House,\" let me say that I love the gothic haunted house tale, and it's hard to go wrong with it in my eyes. There have been \"updated\" versions of the story, of which \"Hell House\" by Richard Matheson is probably my favorite. This story tries to up the ante with gore, but it fails to do go anywhere because the tension wasn't set at the beginning. Edward Lee's \"Flesh Gothic\" does a far better job at telling a gooey, gory, gothic tale because his characters are distinct, and the violence and perversions feel dirty, with a strong undercurrent of sex and the occult. A few ass references and repeated mentions of figging just aren't very titillating.Ultimately, the story fails to rise to the level of its conceits. It reads much more like a fleshed-out draft than a completed novel. The spelling and grammar issues plus the sloppy storytelling make it clear that the story needs a date or two with an editor. Really disappointed, because Kilborn is usually good for a fun/queasy grindhouse story."}, {"userName": "Lynxmama", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7281204-lynxmama", "userReview": "Great book.

To horror fans? Absolutely. It is a tight if stereotypical package of gore horror. Yet its gimmick may narrow the scope. Horror writer Jack Kilborn and his attached-at-more-than-the-hip mystery author friend J. A. Konrath have previously written six horror and mystery novels titled Afraid, Endurance, Trapped, Serial Killers:Uncut, Origin, and The List. In this novel, Kilborn brings back all the main characters of those books through the premise of a scientist inviting them to spend the night in a haunted house and having the chance to win one million dollars if they survive the night. They should have listened to the old saying to never bet against the house. But then we wouldn't have a story, would we?I've read all the previous novels except The List and Serial Killers. I'm also a big Kilborn fan. So it was a little bit like homecoming week for me. Yet I couldn't think about how indifferent most readers would be to this gimmick if they haven't read the others. Kilborn clearly sets it up as a stand alone but in order to do that he needs to leave out essential information in the previous books...like WHAT HAPPENED?!!. This results in characters that are too cardboard when they didn't need to be. As for the plot, it is fairly conventional for most gore horror buffs and very predictable. I won't give away the ending but I kept waiting for the Scooby Doo Gang to show up.Even with that said, this is a fun roller-coaster ride. It's not up to the normal Kilborn/Konrath levels of pulp fun and tension but still worth reading. If you can, read at least a few of the previous novels first."}, {"userName": "Angel Gelique", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13230091-angel-gelique", "userReview": "Another great, gory and suspenseful story from a true master of horror and terror.

Most of these characters I was familiar with, except for one from a short story I never read, but it was still pretty cool to see them all together in one book. However, while it was a bit of fun, this is one of Konrath's weaker entries as the writing was choppy, the humor was misplaced, and the horror wasn't very horrific. This story is about yet another crazy doctor experimenting on people, but this time the doctor wants to eradicate fear. He uses the survivors' fears of their captivity and past abuse to harvest their fear for his experiment. However, the haunted house appears to be a lot more real than the survivors expected. This was a pretty cool concept, but I felt as if the characters were mostly caricatures of themselves. The only two who stayed mostly true to who I thought was Tom Mankowski from The List, and Frank Belgium from Origin. Maybe there were just too many characters in this one story for Konrath to keep their individuality, but it seemed as if many of the characters were... out of character.The other aspect of this story that I didn't particularly care for was the plot. It read just like many of Kilborn's other stories, and was just a bit too similar to Endurance. I may have liked this book more if I hadn't read it right after the previous book, or as a standalone. I've since read past this novel in the collective, and don't see any way this connects to other novels (yet), so I kind of feel as if I could have skipped this book altogether. However, despite the problems with this book I did still enjoy reading it. It was a pretty fun and quick read. Yet, I wouldn't recommend this as a must-read.

But not fully. Not in the least. Both men on their own write some of the most disturbing, both psychologically as well as gut wrenching gore. Together, though, they are not for the weak of heart or spirit in any way, shape or form. They start the novel off by saying that even though there are characters from their other novels in the book this is a stand alone book. This is true, to a point. Reading through and meeting each of the characters I found myself wishing I had already read the novels that each one was a part of so that I would know their personal stories. So that I would have a bit of comparison like a sort of before and after. Now, after the fact, I'm going back and reading all those books and will then probably reread this one, just for that purpose. So though it is a stand alone novel I would highly recommend reading the other novels first.And here I have to give a spoiler alert. I can't talk further without revealing some secrets, so proceed at your own discretion.The basic story is great! Mad scientist is trying to create a cure for fear. As expected it goes horribly wrong. This is not how the novel is portrayed, which would make people want to read it. Instead it's portrayed, and sort of starts out as a haunted house story. Only thing about that is while you're reading through the build up it keeps going through your head, wondering why a haunted house. As things progress it's made very clear that the house is only important for it's reputation and setting. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to downplay the house but I was actually a bit disappoint when I figured out that it wasn't really haunted.The characters were well written. Each one seemed to stay true to how they originally envisioned, but this was based off of the small fill in backstory the authors provided.

I still didn't like the previous two, but I'm glad I read them."}, {"userName": "Brandy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12658772-brandy", "userReview": "The only reason I rated this book one star is that it was not my kind of horror story. I have read many of this author's books & have rated most much higher.

Kilborn/Konrath takes them straight into the pits of HELL!!!! I loved every minute of this novel of terror!"}], "description": "HAUNTED HOUSE is a sequel to the novels AFRAID, TRAPPED, and ENDURANCE. The survivors from those thrillers are all together, and put through a new kind of hell. Also included is Dr. Frank Belgium, from ORIGIN.All characters have back stories. In the case of HAUNTED HOUSE, these back stories exist in other books.While HAUNTED HOUSE can be read as a stand alone, and may be the first Kilborn book read by a lot of people, if a reader enjoys it, he/she can read more about these characters in different novels. And fans of these other novels will enjoy seeing familiar characters show up again in a new novel. - from J.A.
