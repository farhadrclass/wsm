Where are his or her parents? Who is the mysterious old woman who says \"hush,\" and why are her preliminary attempts to quell the destructive behavior of the child not heeded?

Goodnight Air. Goodnight noises everywhere\u201d\t~Margaret Wise BrownThere\u2019s only one time in your life that you say goodbye to everything you\u2019ve come to know and love . . . and even dedicate a little time saying goodbye to the things you\u2019ve come to hate: the shitty bowl of mush growing cold on the night stand that your \u201cold lady\u201d tries to pass off as food, the filthy rodent that\u2019ll probably leave droppings in said mush as you rest comfortably ETERNALLY. Because when you\u2019re about to kick off, even the fecal matter your little brother leaves on the toilet after he forgets to wipe his butt is endearing, and the tasteless, formless garbage your nation has sold to you as \u201cfood\u201d reminds you that's it's better to have the faculties to hate and loathe than to have nothing at all. Most classic poets painted death with a palette of the morose and depressing. There was no room for clich\u00e9 rhymes and red balloons in the classic written rendering of death, until Margaret Wise Brown came into the picture. In 1947, Brown threw out all the conventions established by previous poets writing about death, bidding folks like Yeats and Donne to say \u201cgoodnight air\u201d as she peppered her death poetry with balloons, bears, and cows jumping over the moon.Her work reminds us that death does not have to be a subject of woe. Death is best reminisced about with a cocktail of kittens and mittens, chairs and bears. The proverbial spoonful of sugar Brown gives to us with her stylistic rendering helps the medicine go down, as it were, continuing the discourse established by her predecessors and taking it in a direction desperately needed by people today. This is not just a book about a stubborn rabbit with OCD who will not go to bed until he lists everything in his room. This is a story about the human condition, and a celebration of our greatest collective vulnerability. Read. This.

It was written by Margaret Wise Brown and illustrated by Clement Hurd. Many American adults remember it as their favourite bedtime story, and it continues to lull young children to sleep to this very day.The book describes a bedtime ritual, more than telling an actual story. A young anthropomorphic bunny is in bed saying \u201cgood night\u201d to everything she can see around her: \u201cGoodnight room Goodnight moon Goodnight cow jumping over the moon Goodnight light, and the red balloon ...\u201dThere are three books in the series, all by the same author and illustrator, the others being \u201cThe Runaway Bunny\u201d and \u201cMy World\u201d. These three books have been published together as a collection, with the overall title \u201cOver the Moon\u201d.In this rhyming poem, the bunny works her way through seemingly random but personally significant objects, such as a red balloon, the bunny\u2019s doll\u2019s house, two kittens, a brush and comb and so on. The book has slowly become a bestseller. It has currently sold an estimated 48 million copies, and been translated into over a dozen different languages. It is hard to see the attraction, save that a bedtime ritual is helpful and reassuring, little children love rhymes, and a familiar short book often becomes a favourite. The illustrations are simply drawn, and coloured in flat areas with no shading. There is a spacious feel about the room, however, and the light cast on the bunny seems benevolent; the moon outside friendly, the twinkly stars restful and familiar. To an adult it may seem surreal, but there is an appeal for young children. It seems to be the case with several great writers of children\u2019s classics, that they never leave their childhood behind in the conventional way. They never really become settled domestically, in happy relationships, or as normally functioning members of society. Perhaps the most inspired children\u2019s writers never grow up. Margaret Wise Brown was a restless and unsettled person. She never had children of her own, and her affairs were often chaotic and unstable. She had periods of despair and loneliness, and there are many reports of her provocative or obstructive comments. Her books may seem delightfully whimsical, but under the surface seemingly lies isolation and turmoil. She called one longstanding lesbian lover, \u201cRabbit\u201d, but even their relationship was by all accounts rocky and tormented. In desperation her lover once took an illustrator aside and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you marry Margaret and take her off my hands?\u201d Perhaps it is the author\u2019s brittle and alienated personality which enabled her to empathise with how little children would feel reassured. Margaret Wise Brown once said that she considered the purpose of children\u2019s books to be: \u201cto jog him with the unexpected and comfort him with the familiar.\u201dQuite prolific in her work, Margaret Wise Brown originally worked as a teacher, and also studied art. It was while working at the \u201cBank Street Experimental School\u201d in New York City, that she started writing books for children. The school believed in a new approach to children\u2019s education and literature, one which was rooted in the real world, and the here and now. Margaret Wise Brown embraced both this philosophy, and also was influenced by the poet Gertrude Stein.She once referred to the:\u201cpainful shy animal dignity with which a child stretches to conform to a strange, adult social politeness.\u201dMargaret Wise Brown\u2019s first children\u2019s book was published in 1937 and entitled \u201cWhen the Wind Blew\u201d. She went on to develop her \u201cHere and Now\u201d stories, and later the \u201cNoisy Book\u201d series. Between 1944 and 1946, she wrote three picture books under the pseudonym \u201cGolden MacDonald\u201d. Even in her personal life the author went by various nicknames, perhaps seeking an identity. To some she was \u201cTim\u201d, as her hair was the colour of timothy hay. To others she was \u201cBrownie\u201d. To those who were familiar with the use of the pseudonym \u201cGolden MacDonald\u201d, she was \u201cGoldie\u201d. Early in the 1950s she wrote several books for the \u201cLittle Golden Books\u201d series, including \u201cThe Color Kittens\u201d, \u201cMister Dog\u201d, and \u201cScuppers The Sailor Dog\u201d.Margaret Wise Brown was a lifelong beagler, very keen on hunting hares and rabbits. A beagle pack of ten or more hounds, following the animals by scent, would usually be followed on foot. The author's enthusiasm and ability to keep pace with the hounds was well known at the time. In one interview for \u201cLife\u201d magazine, the reporter expressed surprise that such affectionate portrayals of so many rabbits in her books could be created by one who had such a zest for hunting and shooting rabbits. The author replied: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t especially like children, either. At least not as a group. I won\u2019t let anybody get away with anything just because he is little.\u201dEven her last moments seem akin to something from a black farce. Margaret Wise Brown was in a hospital in France, with appendicitis. The operation seemed to be routine, and she was clearly in one of her ebullient social moods. Earlier the same year she had met James Stillman \u201cPebble\u201d Rockefeller Junior at a party, and they became engaged. One morning, she jokily kicked her leg in a can-can style, to prove to one of the medics how well she was recovering. An embolism killed her instantly. Perhaps she would have appreciated this grotesquerie.Margaret Wise Brown left behind over 70 unpublished manuscripts. Her sister tried to sell them without success, so kept them instead, in a cedar trunk for decades. Comprising more than 500 typewritten pages in all, they were rediscovered in 1991, and most have now been published. Many of them have new illustrations, but most, like this edition of Goodnight Moon are still in print with the original illustrations.The book is compact and sturdy. In this case \u201cboard\u201d book describes the pages as well as the cover. It is very substantial and can withstand overly affectionate treatment by the smallest people. However, neither the text nor the illustrations of the book especially appeal to me. I do understand that it has had a classic appeal to several generations. I see that no less than fifteen of my friends have rated it 5 stars, and several more rate it above average. I have to assume then, that in this case I am out of step with the target audience, and let this book stay at my personal default of 3 stars."}, {"userName": "John Beeler", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/158456-john-beeler", "userReview": "What is about this book that haunts me?

I was initially attracted to the simple sweetness of the story, but with each reading another complex layer is revealed, and more questions arise.A close inspection of the room's artwork gives you your first clue that not all is right with this world. The cow jumping over the moon? Standard nursery wall fare. The three bears? More storybook silliness, but wait... there's no Goldilocks in the picture, or overturned chairs/porridge bowls. There are just three naked bears in an empty room, sitting quietly in low chairs with their arms crossed. Madness, but nothing compared to the depraved picture on the opposite wall, in which a grown rabbit wearing wading pants is using a carrot on a line to fish for bunnies.Then there's the full bowl of mush carelessly left next to the bed. The mouse will certainly eat the mush once everyone is asleep, provided that the kittens don't eat the mouse first. And I do not know much about 1940's culture, but I think it's legitimate to ask whether a family of rabbits in a single-room-occupancy could afford such treasures as helium baloons and leopard-skin rugs.Who exactly is living in this room? There is an adult, but the bunny never says \"Mommy\" or \"Nana\" but instead only refers to \"the old lady whispering 'hush'.\" I don't want to believe that the protagonist was kidnapped down by the river by the Evil Fisherman Rabbit, but it becomes increasingly difficult to believe otherwise.As the bunny goes through his nightly routine, the story leaves Fairyland and enters the Theatere of the Absurd. \"Goodnight comb and goodnight brush,\" the bunny whispers, lest the old lady hush him again. \"Goodnight nobody, goodnight mush.\" Whoa. That's some existential stuff right there. \"Goodnight nobody\"... the silly playfulness of a child, or the stark realization of life's essential emptiness? And \"goodnight mush\" may be the saddest two words in the English language.The final page brings with it more mysteries. (Spoiler alert!) The old lady has suddenly disappeared, presumably eaten by the kittens who now occupy her rocking chair. Meanwhile, the bunny babbles \"goodnight noises everywhere,\" desparately tring to silence the clamor in his head.All in all, \"Goodnight Moon\" is a complex tome that my son (literally) and I (figuratively) can really sink our teeth into."}, {"userName": "Ronyell", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1169488-ronyell", "userReview": "\u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d is a classic bedtime story by Margaret Wise Brown along with illustrations by Clement Hurd and it is basically about a small rabbit is saying goodnight to all the objects and pets in his room. \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d is a true cult hit for children of all ages.Margaret Wise Brown\u2019s story is extremely cute and heartwarming as the little rabbit not only says goodnight to everything he spots in his room, but also states to the audience about the various things that he spots, similar to how the child has to find certain objects or people in the \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo\u201d and \u201cI Spy\u201d books.

Ethereal. Hypnotic. Goodnight Moon is pretty brilliant for a board book. Well done, Margaret Wise Brown. It rhymes. It repeats. And the pages alternate between color and black and white, perhaps suggesting that the little bunny is falling asleep and sees these objects in his mind or half-sleep. But it makes you wonder if any of this is real or if he's just imagining the clearly arbitrary colored bedroom in his dreams. It's like Inception but for kids and with bunnies. And much like that spinning top in Inception, the cow just keeps jumping over the moon. Clement Hurd's colors are intense. Green. Yellow. Orange red. I'm no art student or interior decorator, but damn, that's some serious clashing. Yet it really is visually striking, much like the graphic novel I just reread, Watchmen. Yes, I just compared Goodnight Moon to Watchmen. Clement Hurd is basically the Dave Gibbons of children's literature. Because of the abritrary, unrealistic and dreamlike use of color. It's psychedelic and crazy. But somehow my daughter likes to look at it. And at the root of it all, it helps her go to sleep.

Although the edition I read was a board book, it is also availbe in paperback and hardback formats which would probably be more suitable for a school setting (as children tend to think that board books are for babies and will avoid them on that basis). I've offered to read this book to my nieces and nephews at bedtime on a number of occaisions and it never gets refused!Although the illustrations are maybe not as sophiscated as in more modern books, I think they are probably just as enchanting for a child today as they were for a child over 60 years ago when it was first published. In each of the 'wide-angle' illustrations of the bedroom, everything mentioned in the text is visable even though it may take a little searching for! This is a great way to encourage a child to relate the illustrations to the text.

The words of the bedtime story fall from the lips as a lullaby; it is impossible to keep a harsh edge from one\u2019s voice from dissolving into the tender rhythm. Of the nearly one hundred books written by Margaret Wise Brown, Goodnight Moon is notably one of her most beloved. The late Clement Hurd was best known for his work illustrating Goodnight Moon; his charming collaboration launched his career as an illustrator of children\u2019s books. The bold orange and green that blankets each page coupled with simple, recurring stripes disappear slowly into darkness as the charming little bunny fights sleep.

Then have them figure out how much time passes in the story.Art - \"Noticing Details\" - The bunny says goodnight to most of the items in the room, but there are some that he misses. Encourage children to look closely at the pictures in the book and list the items that the bunny misses when he says goodnight.Science - \"Phases of the Moon\" - The moon in the story is full. Point out to children that most newspapers will list the phase the moon is in on the weather page. Have them look in their local newspaper to find out what phase the moon is in. Help them to predict when the next full moon will occur."}, {"userName": "Maicie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2512140-maicie", "userReview": "For shame!

My mother used to read it to my brother and me allthe time when we were younger, until she grew so tired of it that she bought it for us on cassette and we played it enough times that the tape became messed up. The illustrations are phenomenal, the wording light and simple. It's something we can all relate to, saying no goodnight to anything and everyone, just to prolong our bedtime. I'm glad that, at the ripe old age of 22, I bought my own copy and shared it with someone dear to me."}, {"userName": "Mohammed Al-Garawi", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4650824-mohammed-al-garawi", "userReview": "There's something deep about this bedtime story and I can't put my finger on it.Is it the emptiness?

I find it easy and enjoyable to read aloud. This is quickly becoming a favorite and one I'd be happy to read to him every day!
