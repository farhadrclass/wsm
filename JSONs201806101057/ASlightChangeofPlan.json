Fun chick-lit about dating again in your 50's!A pleasant, amusing read but a little too \"long in the tooth\"! Some portions of the story could have been a little less wordy. I did enjoy the overall premise, the humor and could relate to some of the family situations, especially when she talked about caring for her elderly mother. The setting was also familiar to me since I live near the area where the story takes place, that was very enjoyable and made it easy to envision it all in my mind! Overall, an easy, relatable, witty read that unfortunately dragged a bit! Still, there were plenty of sweet shining moments and laugh out loud dilemmas only someone of this age group could truly understand! I know I did! Time marches on, don't fight it, embrace it the best you can and laugh or you'll just be miserable! This was my first read by this author and I will be looking for more of her books!"}, {"userName": "Musing", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7341553-musing", "userReview": "From page one of this delicious contemporary romance, \nA Slight Change of Plan,\nI had a smile on my face. Such is the clever, witty and delightful prose of Dee Ernst. Kate Everett has decided it's time to move on to 'the next phase' of her life. Time to explore the possibility of new love, downsize her home, attempt to downsize her responsibilities. However, nothing is ever as simple as it appears. Her estranged mother causes grief, an old flame tempts her to resurrect their steamy college relationship and a handsome, debonair Englishman invites unknown pleasures. In the midst of this, her independent adult children navigate new lives causing ripples of their own. Was life ever uncomplicated? Will it ever be?Ernst's characters are always real and endearing. Throughout the engaging story, the witty repartee between characters will cause many laugh-out-loud moments. Yet, interestingly, despite the fun you will experience when you read fifty-five-year-old Kate's story of life and love, due to the impressive depth and many heartfelt poignant moments, you might also cry a little.I loved it. Once again, Dee Ernst has created a gem. The combination of her beautiful storytelling, her quick-witted humor and her believable, lovable characters delivered a quality and highly recommended read. Grab this one. Become a Dee Ernst fan. Thank you NetGalley and Dee Ernst, for this ARC, in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Sandra Nachlinger", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4970099-sandra-nachlinger", "userReview": "I almost always enjoy a book that has a Baby Boomer as the main character, and A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLAN stands out as one of the very best. With a voice that's all her own, Dee Ernst tackles the difficulties of caring for aging parents, challenges of young adult children, and unexpected consequences of entering the world of online dating. But this book doesn't just address the challenges of growing older. It's also about friendship, perseverance, and adaptability. Written with humor and warmth, this story will appeal to readers of all ages.At age 55, Kate Everett has had a successful career as a lawyer, raised three children (now grown), and faced widowhood. As the story opens, she no longer enjoys her solitude as much as she used to, and she wants \u201c\u2026somebody who was happy to see me when I got home who didn\u2019t have a separate water bowl.\u201d So she takes action to change her life by selling her large family home and moving into a smaller condo, leaving her job, and signing up for an online dating service. But then there\u2019s a slight change of plan, which turns out not to be so slight after all. Author Dee Ernst kept me wondering what was going to happen next. When Kate moves into her condo, her new digs seem perfect for one person, until \u2026. And the new job she has accepted seems just right for this stage of her life, until \u2026 Then when she reconnects with an old love on a dating website, things seem to be going well, until\u2026. I won\u2019t spoil the surprises by revealing what happens, but I will say that the character handles all the unexpected changes in her life with love, humor, and the help of dear friends.In addition to enjoying Ms. Ernst\u2019s accomplished prose, I was glad to see that the book was free of grammatical and typographical errors, which I always appreciate. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll read A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLAN more than once."}, {"userName": "Sue Jochens", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18154485-sue-jochens", "userReview": "I received an advanced reader copy and this is my absolutely honest review for no compensation whatsoever. No spoilers - just a general outline. *I realize this is on the audio version and will move it to the print version when available.Dee Ernst has done it again. After the first 100 pages, I actually got out a highlighter to mark favorite favorite lines and conversations. At one point I was laughing so hard I dropped the book and just couldn't stop. (Y'all will know where, when you read about Marco and Cheryl's date.) An honest, true-to-life book about a 55 year old widow, her slightly nutty family, her fabulous friends, and the re-emergence of the love of her life, who dumped her in college. I wish I was part of Kate's circle.I fell immediately in love with all the characters (well, maybe Tom not so much), and cannot wait for this to be released so my pre-ordered copy on Kindle arrives and I can re-read it, highlighting some of my favorite passages (\"My Italian mother belonged to one of the more complicated religious affiliations - Lapsed Catholicism)for all to see.

I bought Dee Ernst\u2019s debut novel, Better Off Without Him (2010), an eBook, without having read a single review or having one friend recommend it. I bought it based solely on the description of a romance writer with teenage children going through a divorce with the help of her friends and a sexy plumber, and I consider it one of my smartest book buys of 2012. I loved the book. I laughed so loudly that my family asked me to share the joke. When I saw A Slight Change of Plan on NetGalley, I eagerly requested the privilege of reviewing it, another smart decision. A Slight Change of Plan is a worthy follow-up to Better Off Without Him.I think anyone with a sense of humor will enjoy this book, but I think it resonates particularly with women old enough to have their own fund of mixed memories, hard-earned experience, and reservoirs of love for all the family and friends and lovers, old and new, who own a piece of their hearts.Often I found myself pausing to reread a sentence or a page. Sometimes the pause was to extend the moment of laughter, but more often it was to luxuriate in the feeling that I was sharing something special. The novel is written in first person, and so all that the reader knows is filtered through Kate\u2019s voice. For some readers that may present a problem, but it is not one for me. I love the intimacy of the first-person point of view. It gave me the feeling that Kate was a person I knew well and liked a great deal and the feeling that Ernst is an author who knows and understands the life I have lived, the lives my friends have lived.If you like romantic comedy that makes you laugh and smile and think and remember, I highly recommend A Slight Change of Plan. If you like it as much as I did, you can still get a digital copy of Better Off Without Him at a very reasonable price. And I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s next from Dee Ernst.See full review at:http://justjanga.blogspot.com/2013/11..."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5245611-amy", "userReview": "4.5 rounded down because the heroine's sexytimes were \"onscreen\" for every guy but the one she ended up with. This book explored the \"what if\"s of a second chance with the one who got away and I walked away with a whole new perspective on love and regrets - so thank you, Dee Ernst.Kate's a 55yo widow with three adult children. Eight years after the death of her unfaithful husband, she's finally ready to date again. Her son's girlfriend introduces her to online dating. Hilarity and the reality of dating after a long, long hiatus ensues. I loved Kate's life. She had such a lovely, tight knit group of confidantes and family. Her strained relationship with her mother hurt to read about but it made the ending that much more fulfilling.

Oldest son Jeff lives in the West Village with his partner Gabe; daughter Regan is planning her wedding with Phil; and Sam is a perpetual student on his way to his Ph.D. And finally, after all these years, she has left her law practice, planning to teach a few classes at a nearby college. At fifty-five, she believes there is still time for life changes.One of those changes is to sell the big house in suburban New Jersey that no longer feels comfortable. In her weekly telephone conversations with the kids, she fills them in on some of her plans. Like buying that condo in Castle Crossings. So when her house and the condo are in escrow, soon to close, she is stunned when her youngest son, Sam, who has a new girlfriend named Alisa, calls up to ask if the two of them can move into the big old house with her.Don\u2019t any of her kids listen to her when she talks? Narrated in Kate\u2019s first person voice, A Slight Change of Plan is a funny, somewhat snarky, and totally down-to-earth story of a woman\u2019s journey into the second act of her life. Can online dating work for her? What if she actually reached out to her first love, Jake Windom, who \u201cwaved\u201d to her on her online profile? Why do her children suddenly seem needy and full of opinions about her life and its changes? And what about her aging mother, suffering from dementia, who now needs someone to look after her?I loved the very real characters, like her old friend Cheryl, who grows pot in her backyard and has some unique ideas about relationships. And then there is a new and fascinating man who will be her daughter\u2019s new father-in-law. As the possibilities begin to present themselves, Kate will begin to realize that making plans is not all it is cracked up to be.

The characters are fantastic. They made me laugh out loud, shake my head in annoyance, and want to join them all at Kate\u2019s monthly spaghetti dinner. I adored the main character, Kate. She is strong, matter of fact, and has a certain wisdom about her that only comes from learning from the past. She loves her family and her friends and even though she is scared she is willing to try new things in hopes of creating more happiness in her life. She rolls with the punches and handles them with grace and good sense. I guess what I am trying to say is she has gumption and I hope that I am as smart as she is when I am 55.Dee Ernst has written a story that falls outside the normal standards for romance and it works beautifully. It is fun, funny, and full of heart. I loved that the characters had a maturity about them but at the same time still had flaws and things to work out in their life and in their character. She shows the complexity and the beauty of relationships, acceptance, and moving on while at the same time delivering a dose of realistic and sometimes cringe worth humor.

This I don\u2019t agree with. Some of my favorite books have featured mothers and women either much older or younger than me, and I\u2019ve had a fine time reading their stories. A Slight Change of Plan falls into that category. Kate is fifty-five and a widow, with three grown children. I\u2019m twenty-six, recently married, zero kids (unless you count my new puppy). But her story captivated me from the beginning and I eagerly read this book quite quickly. There are plenty of interesting sub-plots \u2013 from Kate dealing with her mother, her daughter getting married, her son having a baby \u2013 that each chapter felt action-packed, even when the main storyline wasn\u2019t being discussed.

A pragmatist with a romantic soul, Kate is a wholly likeable protagonist and I'd be happy to share a glass of wine, or a spaghetti dinner, with her any time. The situations Kate are faced with are ones many mature women can relate to from the irritation of hot flushes to the concern for an aging mother, and I think Ernst portrays them in a realistic manner, if sometimes slightly exaggerated for comic effect.
